    "an immediate example is dry friction between rough surfaces .",

    "type models can be successfully applied  . in the eq model ,",
    "the two ( top and bottom ) mutually sliding surfaces are coupled by a set of contacts , representing , e.g. , asperities , patches of lubricant , or 2d crystalline domains .",
    "a contact is assumed to behave as a spring of elastic constant @xmath2 so long as its length is shorter than a critical value @xmath5 ; above this length the contact breaks , to be subsequently restored with lower stress .",

    "the @xmath13th contact connects the slider and the substrate through a spring of shear elastic constant @xmath14 . when the slider is moved , the position of each contact point changes , the contact spring elongates ( or shortens ) so that the slider experiences a force @xmath15 from the interface , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the shift of the @xmath13th junction from its unstressed position .",

    "for all cases mentioned in introduction  the contact of rough surfaces ( both for elastic or plastic asperities ) , the contact of polycrystal ( flat ) substrates , and the case of lubricated interface , when the lubricant , melted during a slip , solidifies and forms bridges at stick ,  the distribution @xmath23 is rather wide with a large concentration of small - threshold contacts  @xcite , which makes the value of @xmath124 very small .",

    "_ discussion_. the fk - me model used here is rather close to the well - known 1d burridge  knopoff ( bk ) model of earthquakes with a velocity  weakening friction law  @xcite .",
    "the difference is in the interface force @xmath403 : we use the function derived from the me - eq model ( with well - defined parameters which may be extracted from experiments or calculated from first principles ) , whereas the bk model adopts a phenomenological velocity - dependent function for @xmath470 .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative behavior of the two models is similar , the bk model also exhibits solitary - wave dynamics as was demonstrated numerically in ref .  @xcite . in our case , however , by reducing the model to the fk - me one , we can describe the solitary waves analytically and rigorously .    in the simulation we started from the well - defined initial configuration , when all contacts are relaxed except the one or two where kink s motion is initiated .",
    "if one starts from a random initial configuration , we expect that kinks will emerge at random places , so that several kinks may propagate through the system simultaneously , as was observed in simulation of the bk model  @xcite .",
    "also we assumed that all @xmath10-contacts are characterized by the same @xmath403 dependence and thus have the same threshold values @xmath471 .",
    "this is correct if the number of original contacts within a single @xmath10-contact , @xmath472 , is infinite .",
    "otherwise , different @xmath10-contacts will have different threshold values @xmath473 however the distribution of their thresholds is narrower that the distribution of thresholds of single asperities by a factor @xmath474 .",
    "a narrow distribution of thresholds will nevertheless have a qualitative effect because rupture fronts may stop when they meet @xmath10-contacts with a threshold above the driving force .",
    "when the interface is disordered , the avalanches will have finite lengths and may become short for forces near @xmath475 , for which the rupture fronts propagate at the minimal velocity .    our approach may also incorporate the existence of disorder and defects always present in real materials . on the one hand ,",
    "defects may nucleate kinks ( cracks ) ; on the other hand , the kink propagation may be slowed down up to its complete arrest due to pinning by the defects .",
    "for example , the slowing down of the 1d crack propagating through a 2d system with quenched randomly distributed defects was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus , reducing the eq - me model of friction to the fk - me one , we described avalanche - like dynamics of the frictional interface  the solitary wave of contacts breaking .",
    "if the force @xmath403 has a sawtooth shape , then the interface dynamics may be described analytically ; otherwise one has to use numerics .",
    "the analogy with the fk model may be extended even further : + @xmath476 the driven fk model exhibits hysteresis when the force increases and then decreases  @xcite .",
    "the same effect was observed in the large - scale crack simulation  @xcite , thus could be observed in the frictional interface too .",
    "+ @xmath476 effects of nonzero temperature may be considered .",
    "one may predict that at @xmath385 the sliding kinks will experience an additional damping , while the immobile ( e.g. , arrested ) kinks will slowly move ( creep ) due to thermally activated jumps .",
    "+ @xmath476 as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , a fast driven kink begins to oscillate due to excitation of its shape mode , and then , with the further increase of driving , the kink is destroyed .",
    "this effect is similar to what is observed in fracture mechanics , where cracks begin to oscillate and then branch  @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath476 if the interaction between the atoms is nonlinear and stiff enough , the fk model admits the existence of supersonic kinks  @xcite which are similar to solitons of the toda chain .",
    "it would be interesting to study if similar waves may appear in the frictional interface , as was predicted in crack propagation  @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath476 one may suppose that the damping coefficient @xmath337 in the equation of motion  ( [ crack.eqi00 ] ) depends on the kink velocity , @xmath477 . in fracture mechanics , this coefficient defines the rate at which the energy is removed from the crack edge , thus it plays a crucial role .",
    "+ @xmath476 a large number of works is devoted to different generalizations of the fk model to 2d system ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , if kinks attract one another in the @xmath478 ( transverse ) direction , they unite into a line ( dislocation ) which moves as a whole ( or due to secondary kinks ) .",
    "we discussed the crucial role in sliding friction of the elastic interaction between the contacts at the inhomogeneous frictional interface and proposed various approaches to treat this problem from different viewpoints .",
    "the interaction produces a characteristic elastic correlation length @xmath479 . at distance",
    "@xmath480 the slider may be considered as a rigid body but with a strong contacts interaction , which leads to shrinking of the effective contact breaking threshold distribution and an enhanced possibility for a mechanical elastic instability to appear , which is conducive to stick slip . at large distances",
    "@xmath4 , the contact - contact interaction leads to screening of local perturbations in the interface , or to appearance of collective modes ( frictional cracks ) propagating as solitary waves .    in our work",
    "we assumed that the external stress ( the driving force ) is uniform across the system . in a general case , however , stress is nonuniform and may moreover change with ( adjust itself to ) interface dynamics , so that the problem should be considered self - consistently . for given boundary conditions , determined by the experimental setup , one should calculate the stress field , e.g. , by finite element technique , which provides the driving force @xmath481 in the fk - me model .",
    "the latter defines the displacement field at the interface through the solution of the fk - me master equations .",
    "the displacement field in turn is to be used as the boundary condition for the elastic - theory equations at the frictional interface ( from other sides of the slider , the boundary conditions should correspond to a given experimental setup ) .",
