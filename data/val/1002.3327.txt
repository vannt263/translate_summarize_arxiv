    "during the crystallization of a plasma containing multiple ion species , the chemical composition of the solid is in general different from that of the liquid .",
    "this type of chemical separation is important for both white dwarfs @xcite and accreting neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the interior of a white dwarf is a mixture of carbon , oxygen , and traces of other elements , most abundantly neon .",
    "as the star cools , chemical separation leads to the formation of an oxygen- and neon - rich core .",
    "the energy released through the gravitational settling of the denser core material heats the star and can delay cooling by several gyr @xcite .",
    "a neutron star accretes mostly hydrogen and helium from its companion , but this material undergoes a series of nuclear reactions , including rapid proton capture @xcite and then electron capture reactions @xcite , to produce a variety of elements . through accretion the mixture is pushed deep into the star and solidifies .",
    "recent numerical simulations have shown that the mixture undergoes chemical separation during solidification @xcite , possibly forming a two - phase solid @xcite .",
    "the composition of the liquid ocean and the structure and composition of the crust have important implications for a range of observed phenomena .",
    "for example , the resulting thermal conductivity determines the cooling rate of transiently accreting neutron stars following extended accretion outbursts @xcite .",
    "the mechanical strength of the crust limits the size of a possible crust quadrupole and therefore gravitational wave emission @xcite .",
    "several groups have studied the liquid - solid phase transition and chemical separation of two- and three - component plasmas in the classical , ideal limit ( i.e. , ignoring quantum mechanical effects on the ions and treating the electrons as a uniform background ; cf . ref .",
    "early works ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) studied phase transitions in carbon - oxygen plasmas , but the approximations used were too crude for application to the interiors of white dwarfs .",
    "accurate calculations using the mean spherical approximation in the density - functional formalism were performed by @xcite , who studied carbon - oxygen plasmas , and by @xcite , who studied arbitrary two - component plasmas with atomic number @xmath1 ratios up to 2 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite , where carbon - oxygen - neon plasmas are examined ) . using monte carlo calculations and @xmath1 ratios up to 5",
    ", @xcite studied arbitrary two- and three - component plasmas and @xcite studied arbitrary two - component plasmas with a very accurate measurement of the liquid free energy ( see also refs .",
    "all of these groups present phase diagrams as a function of ion abundance , and some @xcite also present fitting formulae for the liquid and solid free energies . using these diagrams and fitting formulae , one can determine the phase transition properties for a two - component plasma of any ion type and abundance .",
    "these calculations are particularly useful for the interior of a white dwarf , where there are only two or three dominant elements .",
    "but in the ocean of an accreting neutron star there are around 10 - 20 elements with abundances @xmath2 @xcite , each one with a potentially important effect on the behavior of the phase transition and chemical separation of the mixture .",
    "the available analytic or numerical results for this type of system are extremely limited .",
    "we are aware of only one study of phase transitions in plasmas with more than three components , that of @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "these authors used molecular dynamics simulations to study a 17-component plasma with a composition similar to that expected at the ocean - crust interface of an accreting neutron star . due to the large amount of computing power necessary to run each simulation ,",
    "the phase transition properties have so far only been calculated for one composition .",
    "we present here a method for rapidly calculating the properties of the liquid - solid phase transition in a multi - component plasma in the classical ideal limit , for any initial composition and ion types .",
    "our method is a semi - analytic calculation that relies on extending the accurate fitting formulae available for the one- , two- , and three - component plasmas to the case of a plasma with an arbitrary number of components .",
    "we test our method using the one data point available for a plasma with more than three components , the calculation of @xcite , and show that it performs very well in that specific case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] we describe the semi - analytic calculation as it applies to the one - component plasma ( section  [ sub : ocp ] ) , the two - component plasma ( section  [ sub : tcp ] ) , and the multi - component plasma ( section  [ sub : mcp ] ) . in section  [ sec : results ] we present our results for the 17-component mixture of @xcite .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "the pressure term in the gibbs free energy and its effect on the phase transition , the importance of the deviation from linear mixing for the liquid free energy , and a simplified derivation of the deviation from linear mixing for the solid free energy , are discussed in three appendices .",
    "we assume in this paper that the system has reached equilibrium , i.e. , the state of lowest free energy .",
    "the validity of this assumption and non - equilibrium effects such as diffusion and sedimentation will be discussed in a later paper .",
    "we also assume here that the phase transition happens at constant volume , in which case the equilibrium configuration of the system is determined by the state with the lowest helmholtz free energy , @xmath3 . in reality",
    "the transition happens at constant pressure and at minimized gibbs free energy .",
    "the error introduced by using the constant volume approximation is discussed in appendix  [ sec : gibbs ] .",
    "we find that for the mixture considered in section  [ sec : results ] , the abundance in the liquid state of each ion species is in error by no more than @xmath4 . while the percentage errors in the abundances in the solid state are typically larger by factors of @xmath5-@xmath6 , the absolute errors for each ion species are similar in either state .",
    "( since this trend holds true for most of the approximations we make in this paper , we hereafter quote errors in our approximations only for the liquid abundances . )",
    "note that in transitions at constant volume , the free energy of the electrons is identical in the liquid and in the solid and so has no effect on the properties of the phase transition .",
