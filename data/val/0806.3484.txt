    "the connections between algebras , statistical mechanics , link invariants , and topological quantum field theories have long been exploited to great effect .",
    "the simplest and best - understood example of such involves the temperley - lieb algebra , the potts model , the jones polynomial , and @xmath3 chern - simons gauge theory .",
    "the study of these connections originated with temperley and lieb s work on the potts model in statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "they showed how to write the transfer matrix of several two - dimensional lattice models , including the @xmath1-state potts model , in terms of the generators of an algebra which bears their name .",
    "writing the transfer matrix in terms of the generators of the tl algebra is very useful for statistical mechanics because a number of physical quantities of the system follow purely from the properties of this algebra , not its presentation .",
    "for example , this rewriting yields the result that when @xmath4 , the self - dual point of the potts model is critical , whereas for @xmath5 it is not .",
    "recently such connections found an important new application in condensed matter physics , in the study of topological states of matter , cf @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a number of results at the intersection of combinatorics , quantum topology , and statistical mechanics which have applications both in mathematics , specifically to the properties of the chromatic polynomial of planar graphs and its relation to link invariants , and in physics ( in the study of the potts model and of quantum loop models ) .",
    "we explain how the _ chromatic algebra _ provides a natural setting for studying algebraic - combinatorial properties of the chromatic polynomial .    in particular , the chromatic algebra discussed in this paper underlies the quantum loop models discussed in @xcite and further developed in @xcite ( closely related models were introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "quantum loop models provide lattice spin systems whose low - energy excitations in the continuum limit are described by a topological quantum field theory @xcite . in both classical and quantum cases , algebraic relations such as the level - rank duality described in @xcite allow one to map seemingly different loop models onto each other .",
    "this turns out to be quite useful in locating critical points in loop models @xcite , a matter of great importance for finding quantum loop models which describe topological order .",
    "in fact , our results can be directly applied to topological quantum field theory .",
    "we show that the chromatic algebra is associated with the @xmath2 bmw algebra , implying that correlators in the @xmath2 topological quantum field theory can be expressed in terms of the chromatic polynomial .",
    "our results can usefully be applied to both classical loop models as well .",
    "expressing classical loop models algebraically as described in this paper allows one to relate loop models to other sorts of statistical - mechanical models , such as models where the degrees of freedom are spins or heights .",
    "in fact , the simplest application of our results is to the same potts model ! the representation of the tl algebra in terms of completely packed loops described in section [ sec : tl ] is not the only geometric representation of the potts model ; another is generally known as the `` low - temperature '' expansion .",
    "we will explain how the chromatic algebra naturally describes the degrees of freedom in this low - temperature expansion .",
    "the utility of the temperley - lieb algebra and its generalizations extends beyond statistical mechanics to the study of invariants of knots and links and of topological quantum field theories .",
    "a graphical presentation of the tl algebra underlies the computation of the jones polynomial @xcite .",
    "each knot or link may be represented as the closure of a braid , giving rise to an element of this algebra , and evaluating the jones polynomial for a link corresponds ( up to a normalization ) to taking the markov trace of this element .",
    "subsequently , witten showed how the jones polynomial is also related to computations in a three - dimensional topological field theory , chern - simons theory @xcite ( see @xcite for an exposition geared toward mathematicians ) .",
    "such computations in chern - simons theory are equivalently described in two - dimensional conformal field theory .",
    "this sequence of relations thus comes full circle , because these conformal field theories describe the scaling limits of two - dimensional statistical - mechanical models at their critical points .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "one goal is to show how these connections between link invariants , algebras , and statistical mechanics allow us to relate seemingly different algebras and their evaluations .",
    "many generalizations of the temperley - lieb algebra and the jones polynomial are now known , and chern - simons theories for other representations of @xmath3 and for other groups are understood .",
    "our main focus is on the @xmath2 birman - murakami - wenzl algebras @xcite , the corresponding specialization of the kauffman polynomial , and the @xmath2 tqfts .",
    "we will explain how results concerning them relate to geometric models of statistical mechanics like the potts model .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to describe the chromatic algebra ( introduced for different reasons in @xcite ) , where the trace of an element is given by the chromatic polynomial of an associated planar graph .",
    "we establish a relationship between the chromatic , @xmath2 bmw , and temperley - lieb algebras and their traces .",
    "the chromatic algebra has a trace pairing defined in terms of the chromatic polynomial , and we show that for @xmath6 this pairing defines a positive - definite hermitian product .",
    "a nice byproduct of our analysis is that identities for the chromatic polynomial can be extended and derived in a more transparent fashion by utilizing the chromatic algebra .",
    "we give an algebraic proof of tutte s golden identity for the chromatic polynomial in a companion publication @xcite .",
    "this striking non - linear identity plays a very interesting role in describing quantum loop models of `` fibonacci anyons '' , where it implies that these loop models should yield topological quantum field theories in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "in our companion paper we also use the jones - wenzl projectors in the chromatic algebra to derive linear identities for the chromatic polynomial .",
    "several authors have considered similar algebraic constructions , for example jones @xcite in the context of planar algebras , kuperberg @xcite in the rank 2 case , martin and woodcock @xcite for deformations of schur algebras , koo and saleur in the setting of integrable lattice models ( cf @xcite ) and walker @xcite in the tqft setting .",
    "our approach and results are different : we derive new relations between the chromatic and the bmw and tl algebras , and we give applications to the structure of the chromatic polynomial of planar graphs .    in section [ sec : tl ] , we review the temperley - lieb algebra , the jones polynomial , and the potts and completely packed models of statistical mechanics . in section [ sec : chromatic ] , we introduce the chromatic algebra , and show how its evaluation gives the chromatic polynomial of the graph dual to the loop configuration . in section [ tqft section ]",
    "we discuss how this algebra may be used to construct the ( doubled ) @xmath2 topological quantum field theory .",
    "section [ sec : trivalent ] establishes a presentation of the chromatic algebra in terms of trivalent graphs .",
    "we relate the chromatic algebra to the @xmath2 bmw algebra in sections [ sec : equivalence ] , [ sec : relations ] , and as a consequence show that their evaluations are equal .",
    "a physical reason for this equivalence has been described in depth in @xcite , and will be reviewed in section [ sec : equivalence ] .",
    "the properties of the trace product on the chromatic algebra are considered in section [ sec : inner product ] .",
    "the paper is concluded by a list of open questions in section [ sec : questions ] .",
    "the temperley - lieb ( tl ) algebra in degree @xmath7 , @xmath8 , is an algebra over @xmath9 $ ] generated by @xmath10 with the relations @xmath11 may be set to equal a specific complex number , and when necessary , we will include the parameter @xmath12 in the notation , @xmath13 .",
    "a presentation of the tl algebra of broad interest is the `` loop '' or `` @xmath12-isotopic '' representation , where the relations of the algebra have a simple geometric interpretation .",
    "the loop representation of @xmath8 acts on a collection of @xmath7 strands as illustrated for @xmath14 in figure [ fig : tl ] . in this setting , an element of @xmath8 is a formal linear combination of @xmath15-dimensional submanifolds in a rectangle @xmath16 .",
    "each submanifold meets both the top and the bottom of the rectangle in exactly @xmath7 points .",
    "the multiplication then corresponds to vertical stacking of rectangles .",
    "these strands are forbidden to cross , but we do allow adjacent strands to join , as displayed in the figure .",
    "one can intuitively think of these as the world lines of particles moving in one dimension ; the joining of adjacent strands corresponds to pair annihilation and recreation .",
    "the generators @xmath17 of the tl algebra in this representation annihilate and recreate the @xmath18th and @xmath19st particles .",

    "namely , a circle ( simple closed curve ) can be removed by multiplying the corresponding element in @xmath23 by @xmath12 .",
    "all isotopic pictures ( which can be deformed continuously into each other without lines crossing and while keeping the points on the boundary fixed ) are considered equivalent .",
    "various presentations of the tl algebra can be used to define lattice statistical - mechanical models . when the @xmath17 are represented by matrices , the degrees of freedom",
    "are usually referred to as spins or heights .",
    "for example , in the @xmath1-state potts model , the degrees of freedom are `` spin '' variables @xmath24 taking integer values @xmath25 at each site of some lattice .",
    "the @xmath17 here are represented by tensor products of @xmath26 matrices , with @xmath27 .",
    "the transfer matrix of the @xmath1-state potts model , with @xmath7 the number of sites on a zig - zag line , can be written entirely in terms of these generators . at the isotropic self - dual point for @xmath7 even , this transfer matrix for the square lattice is @xmath28 \\left[\\prod_{j=1}^{n/2 } ( 1+e_{2j-1})\\right ] \\label{transfer}\\ ] ] the partition function for an @xmath29 system with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath30 direction is then @xmath31 .    a closely related way of defining a statistical mechanical model is via a pictorial presentation .",
    "for this presentation of the tl algebra , this results in the _ completely packed loop model_. this model is defined on any graph with four edges per vertex .",
    "each edge of the graph is covered by a loop , and at each vertex the loops avoid each other in the two possible ways . by using the pictures in figure [ fig : tl ] , each configuration then corresponds to a single word in the tl algebra ( i.e.  some product of the @xmath17 ) .",
    "the transfer matrix on the square lattice at the self - dual point remains ( [ transfer ] ) ; each factor @xmath32 describes the two choices for the loops behavior at a single vertex . expanding the product in @xmath33 into individual words corresponds to writing the partition function as a sum over loop configurations .",
    "the boltzmann weight of each configuration in the completely packed loop model is the `` evaluation '' or the `` markov trace '' of the corresponding element .",
    "this is a linear map of the algebra to the complex numbers , namely , the trace @xmath34 is defined on the additive generators ( rectangular pictures ) by connecting the top and bottom endpoints by disjoint arcs in the complement of the rectangle @xmath16 in the plane .",
    "the result is a disjoint collection of circles in the plane , which are then evaluated by taking @xmath35 .",
    "this completely packed loop model is still often referred to as the potts model in its `` fortuin - kasteleyn '' or `` cluster '' representation @xcite .",
    "note however that although the potts model is originally defined with @xmath36 an integer , in this representation of the tl algebra this constraint is no longer required .    utilizing this pictorial representation and",
    "the markov trace allows one to relate the jones polynomial of knot theory to the tl algebra @xcite .",
    "namely , the jones polynomial can then be computed by projecting a knot or a link onto the plane , where in non - trivial cases the projection will include overcrossings and undercrossings .",
    "these are described by another geometric realization of @xmath8 . here",
    "the elements are framed tangles in @xmath37 $ ] which meet the top and the bottom of the cylinder in @xmath7 specified points , modulo the isotopy and the skein relations @xmath38 we call this the skein - theoretic version , @xmath39 , while the planar one discussed above is @xmath40 .",
    "the planar approach is more suitable for applications to @xmath41 lattice models , while skein theory provides a more well - known route to the construction of topological quantum field theories .",
    "however , it is easy to see that if we set @xmath42 , one has the isomorphisms @xmath43 , and we use the superscript only to indicate a specific geometric context .    up to overall factors of @xmath44 , the jones polynomial for a given collection of links is the markov trace of the corresponding element of the algebra .",

    "the inverse map @xmath52 is defined by resolving any tangle , using the skein relation ( [ jones relation ] ) , into a linear combination of embedded planar pictures .",
    "the relation of the foregoing to topological field theory is well known : the jones polynomial of a collection of links correspond to a correlation function of wilson loops in @xmath3 chern - simons gauge theory @xcite .",
    "these wilson loops transform in the spin-1/2 representation of the @xmath3 algebra .",
    "since the spin @xmath53 representation of @xmath3 is the simplest non - trivial representation of the simplest non - abelian lie algebra , it is natural to expect that the previous results have a myriad of generalizations .",
