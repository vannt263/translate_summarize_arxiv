    "cosmic - rays have been observed up to energies of @xmath4  ev  @xcite , which raises a double problem .",
    "first , one has to find an accelerator capable of reaching such ultra high energies .",
    "second , it has been known for almost four decades that the interaction of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) with ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) should lead to a sharp decrease in their flux above energies around @xmath5  ev  @xcite . in the case of protons , which has given rise to the most detailed investigations , this _",
    "cut - off _ is due to pion photoproduction from cmb photons with energies above the reaction threshold in the proton rest frame .",
    "it has been proposed , however , that heavier nuclei could contribute significantly to the high energy part of the spectrum , as originally investigated by puget , stecker and bredekamp ( psb ) @xcite .",
    "the propagation of nuclei in the intergalactic medium is also influenced by interactions with the background radiation fields , through photodisintegration reactions .    in the nucleus rest frame , at typical uhecr energies of 10@xmath6 - 10@xmath3 ev ,",
    "the cmb photons are boosted to energies in the range between a few hundreds of kev to a few hundreds of mev .",
    "the interaction process between the uhecrs and the cmb is dominated by the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) at photon energies below 30 - 50  mev , and to a lesser extent by the quasideuteron emission for intermediate energies ( between 50 mev and 150 mev ) and the pion photoproductions at energies above 150 mev @xcite . in the original psb model , two major approximations",
    "are performed to estimate the intergalactic uhecr propagation .",
    "the first one concerns the total photoabsorption cross section which is parameterized as a simple gaussian function  @xcite , abruptly cut below the theoretical reaction threshold .",
    "the second one is based on the use of a reduced reaction network , involving only one nucleus for each value of a , to estimate the time evolution of the uhecr composition .",
    "more precisely , assuming that the @xmath7-decay of the unstable nuclei produced by photodisintegration is always faster than the corresponding photoemission rate , a unique nuclear path is followed from the initial @xmath8fe to the final protons @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the impact of these two approximations on the properties of the uhecr photodisintegration , and to provide the scientific community with new accurate determination of the photoreaction rates .",
    "reaction model developments allow now for an accurate and reliable systematic estimate of the photodisintegration rate .",
    "more specifically , photoreactions have been extensively studied in the field of nucleosynthesis , where phenomenological parameterizations of the photoabsorption cross sections have been optimized during the last decades , and large - scale microscopic predictions have also emerged @xcite .",
    "new compilations of experimental photoabsorption data also help in defining the degree of accuracy of the present reaction models to predict the corresponding cross sections .",
    "important progress has also been performed in the same field of nucleosynthesis to solve large reaction networks exactly in order to follow the time evolution of the composition of the material in given astrophysical sites .",
    "similar tools can therefore be used in the field of uhecr to test the psb approximation of a reduced network .",
    "section 2 describes improved calculations of the photodisintegration cross sections , using several phenomenological and microscopic descriptions of the dominant @xmath9-strength function . to test the accuracy of such models ,",
    "they are systematically compared with the available photonuclear data for nuclei with @xmath10 , and with the psb gaussian parameterization .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the study of the impact of the newly - determined photodisintegration cross section on the propagation of a @xmath8fe source .",
    "the approximation of the original psb reduced network is also tested in sect . 3 by comparing the uhecr photodisintegration obtained by solving the full reaction network exactly .",
    "to describe the changes in abundance of the heavy nuclei as a result of the interaction of the uhecr with the cmb , a nuclear reaction network including all interactions of interest must be used .",
    "the chosen set of nuclear species are coupled by a system of differential equations corresponding to all the reactions affecting each nucleus , i.e. mainly photodisintegrations and @xmath7-decays .",
    "the rate of change of the number density @xmath11 of nucleus @xmath12 with charge number @xmath13 and mass number @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the @xmath7-decay rate of nucleus @xmath12 and @xmath17 its photoerosion rate followed by the emission of a single neutron ( @xmath18 ) , proton ( @xmath19 ) or @xmath20-particle ( @xmath21 ) or the emission of multiple particles such as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , including all open channels for a given photon energy distribution .",
    "the cmb photon density n(@xmath27 ) depends only on the uhecr lorentz factor @xmath28 ( where e is the uhecr energy , and m its mass ) @xcite .",
    "the calculations of the cmb density as a function of the photon energy @xmath27 in the nucleus rest frame show that photon energies overlap with the nuclear gdr for @xmath29 ranging from 5.10@xmath30 to 10@xmath31 . in the nucleus rest frame",
    ", the photodisintegration rate @xmath32 can be estimated from the cross section @xmath33 by    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the light speed .",
    "all nuclei lighter than the seed nuclei and located between the valley of stability and the proton drip line must be included in the network . under the most natural astrophysical assumptions ,",
    "uhecrs are accelerated out of the ambient gas , possibly enriched in fe close to neutron stars or depleted in metals ( i.e. nuclei heavier than h ) if significant photodisintegration occurs during the acceleration stage itself .",
    "therefore , if nuclei are indeed present among the uhecrs , it is expected that they typically include the most abundant elements found in the interstellar medium , i.e. essentially lighter than fe .",
    "the interaction of uhecrs with the cmb is thus expected to include all possible nuclei resulting from the photodisintegration of the heaviest species and therefore involve all stable and neutron - deficient unstable isotopes with @xmath36 .",
    "one of the most complete compilation of photonuclear data is provided by the 2000 iaea atlas ( 2000 ) @xcite . nevertheless , as far as elements of interest in the propagation of uhecr are concerned , only a limited set of photonuclear cross sections are known , namely the total photoabsorption cross section as a function of energy for about 10 nuclei and the integrated total photoabsorption cross section for no more than 16 nuclei .",
    "all the remaining rates must therefore be estimated on the basis of theoretical reaction models .",
    "the uncertainties involved in any cross section calculation are not so much related to the model of formation and de - excitation of the compound nucleus itself , than to the evaluation of the nuclear quantities necessary for the calculation of the transmission coefficients .",
    "the total photon transmission coefficient characterizing the probability to excite by photoabsorption a compound nucleus excited state is obviously one of the key ingredients for the evaluation of the photoreaction rates . in the specific astrophysical conditions considered here ,",
    "i.e for uhecr energies of @xmath37  ev , this function is dominated by the @xmath9 transition which is classically estimated within the lorentzian representation of the gdr .",
    "experimental photoabsorption data confirm the simple semi - classical prediction of a lorentzian shape at energies around the resonance energy @xmath38 .",
    "one the most widely used form of the @xmath9-strength function is described by the brink - axel lorentzian model @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath38 and @xmath40 are the energy and width of the gdr , @xmath41 is the nucleon mass and @xmath42 is an exchange - force contribution to the dipole sum rule .",
    "the lorentzian description is known to be less satisfactory at energies away from the gdr peak , and in particular fails to describe the low - energy experimental data , namely the radiation widths and gamma - ray spectra @xcite .",
    "various improvements have been brought to the lorentzian form , mainly by including an energy - dependence of the gdr width capable of modifying the low - energy behavior of the @xmath9-strength @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the photon transmission coefficient is most frequently described in the framework of the phenomenological kopecky - uhl generalized lorentzian model @xcite . in this approximation , the gdr width of eq .",
    "( [ eq_tg ] ) is replaced by an energy - dependent width of the form @xmath43/e_{gdr}^2 $ ] , where @xmath44 is the nuclear temperature and equals zero in the case of photoabsorption reactions .",
    "this model is the most widely used for practical applications , and more specifically when global predictions are requested for large sets of nuclei .",
    "it also requires the determination of the gdr peak energy and width to be predicted from some underlying model for each nucleus . for practical applications",
    ", these properties are either taken directly from experimental compilations ( e.g @xcite ) whenever available , or obtained from a droplet - type model @xcite or some experimental systematics @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological lorentzian approach suffers , however , from shortcomings of various sorts , and most particularly its lack of reliability when dealing with exotic nuclei or energies away from the gdr peak .",
    "for this reason , models of the microscopic type have been developed which are hoped to provide a reasonable reliability and predictive power for the @xmath9-strength function .",
    "attempts in this direction have been conducted within models like the thermodynamic pole approach @xcite , the theory of finite fermi systems or the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) @xcite .",
    "the spherical qrpa model making use of a realistic skyrme interaction has even been used recently for the large - scale derivation of the @xmath9-strength function . in such models , mean",
    "field calculations such as hartree - fock bcs ( hfbcs)@xcite and hartree - fock bogoliubov ( hfb ) @xcite are performed in order to describe the nucleus ground state . on top of these calculations",
    ", the qrpa is used to describe in a microscopic way the gdr .",
    "the linear response theory allows to predict the dipole strength of the excited nucleus .",
    "the only input of these mean - field models is the nucleon - nucleon interaction , including the skyrme part , and the pairing component .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "global hfbcs+qrpa and hfb+qrpa calculations for practical applications were developed in @xcite and shown to predict the location of the gdr in close agreement with experimental data and also to reproduce satisfactorily the average resonance capture data at low energies .",
    "these aforementioned qrpa calculations have been performed for all the @xmath45 nuclei lying between the two drip lines .",
    "note that the latest hfb+qrpa calculation is using the bsk7 skyrme nucleon - nucleon interaction , initially derived to reproduce at best the measured masses @xcite .",
    "the photoreaction cross sections are estimated with the code named talys @xcite which takes into account all types of direct , pre - equilibrium and compound mechanisms to estimate the total reaction probability as well as the competition between the various open channels .",
    "the photoreaction cross section is estimated at energies up to 50 mev .",
    "the calculation includes single particle ( nucleons and alpha ) as well as multi - particle emissions .",
    "all the experimental information on nuclear masses , deformation and low - lying states spectra is considered , whenever available .",
    "if not , global nuclear level formul , and nucleon and alpha - particle optical model potentials are considered to estimate the particle transmission coefficients and the nuclear level .",
    "details on the codes and the nuclear physics input ( ground state properties , nuclear level densities , optical potential ) can be found in the above mentioned references @xcite .",
    "these various nuclear inputs are known to affect the photodisintegration rates mainly around the corresponding threshold energies , but have a relatively lower impact than the @xmath29-ray strength function . to estimate the accuracy of the different approaches available for the evaluation of an @xmath9-strength function ,",
    "the four models presented in the previous sub - section are considered , namely the lorentzian @xcite , the generalized lorentzian @xcite , the hfbcs+qrpa @xcite and the hfb+qrpa @xcite .",
    "in addition to the @xmath9 component , the @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 contributions are also included in the calculation of the @xmath29-ray strength as prescribed by @xcite , but are not varied due to their lower impact in comparison with the gdr . the quasideuteron process is also neglected in the present work due to the limited photon energy range @xcite .",
    "the photoreaction cross sections estimated as explained above are now compared with available experimental data @xcite for nuclei with a@xmath056 .",
    "it should be recalled that , even for stable nuclei , the data on such nuclei are scarce : a cross section measurement , such as ( @xmath29,1nx ) or ( @xmath29,abs ) , is available at various energies for less than half of the stable nuclei with 12@xmath0a@xmath056 .",
    "total photoabsorption cross sections around the gdr peak energy are available for 10 nuclei , while the integrated total photoabsorption cross section is known for 16 nuclei @xcite . the exhaustive comparison performed to compare the predictions with the data",
    "is illustrated below .    to test the model predictions",
    ", we first consider the ( @xmath29,1nx ) cross sections , i.e the photodisintegration leading to a single neutron emission , but possibly also to other extra ejectiles .",
    "this set is of particular importance for our present study since the one - nucleon emission is the dominant process for photon energies in the 0 - 50 mev range .",

    "this modelling of the gdr was performed up to an energy of 30 mev .",
    "though not strongly different from the lorentzian calculations , it is clear that the psb agreement with experimental data is not as good as the one obtained with the lorentzian parameterization .",
    "this may be explained by two features of the psb modelling .",
    "first the psb parameterization assumes a gaussian shape for the gdr , which can differ significantly from the experimentally - confirmed lorentzian shape .",
    "second , the width of the gdr is frequently overestimated by the psb parameterization , compared to the data .",
    "an exhaustive comparison between the psb and the lorentzian parameterization for the @xmath59 50 nuclei used in the psb model , shows also the general trend of a greater width ( typically 2 mev ) for the psb parameterization .",
    "the large psb width can lead to significant discrepancies , especially close to the one - neutron separation energy threshold located around 8 mev .",
    "the gdr contribution close to the neutron threshold plays an important role since it triggers the photodisintegration of uhecrs having just enough energy to be affected by the cmb photons while propagating throughout the universe . an accurate description of this threshold is thus necessary to derive the exact shape of the resulting turnover in the uhecr propagated spectrum .",
    "the larger width also leads to a larger integrated value of the cross section between 0 and 30 mev than in the lorentzian case . on the other hand the total integrated cross section between 0 and 50",
    "mev is rather similar in both models since the lorentzian prescription extends further up to 50 mev while the psb gaussian prescription is limited to energies below 30  mev .",
    "note that both models predict a similar location of the peak energy since they consider experimental information or experimentally - based systematics .",

    "[ fig : prop ] shows that iron nuclei with @xmath70 propagate up to distances 10 times larger than in the higher energy cases , before being stripped from all their nucleons .",

    "we studied in particular the case of a @xmath8fe source and found that the new photoabsorption cross sections mainly modify the disintegration of uhecrs at relatively low lorentz factors ( @xmath83 ) , which is relevant to the shape of the cosmic - ray energy spectrum around the gzk suppression .",
    "the key ingredient proves to be a precise description of the gdr threshold . for higher lorentz factors , details of the nuclear photoreaction rates do not impact much on the propagation distance .",
    "in contrast , it is found that solving a full reaction network can modify the results obtained with simpler nuclear paths , most particularly for the a @xmath79 45 nuclei .",
    "large spreads in the mass distribution reaching @xmath84 7 mass units are obtained when use is made of the full reaction network .",
    "the photodisintegration cross sections calculated with the generalized lorentzian model are tabulated and made available to the scientific community via the nuclear astrophysics library at _ http://www - astro.ulb.ac.be_. these include the ( @xmath29,n ) , ( @xmath29,p ) , ( @xmath29,@xmath20 ) , ( @xmath29,2n ) , ( @xmath29,2p ) , ( @xmath29,2@xmath20 ) , ( @xmath29,np ) , ( @xmath29,n@xmath20 ) , ( @xmath29,p@xmath20 )  for all nuclei with @xmath85 .    the new approach to uhecr photodisintegration described in this paper will be applied to sensible astroparticle situations in forthcoming works , both using astrophysically motivated source compositions and taking into account the intergalactic magnetic fields .",
