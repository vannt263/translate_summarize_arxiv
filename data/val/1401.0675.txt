    "`` periodic thermodynamics '' , a notion coined by w.  kohn , refers to the statistical physics of quantum systems which are driven by an arbitrarily strong time - periodic perturbation , and are weakly coupled to a heat bath  @xcite .",
    "such systems have been considered in the context of , among others , rydberg atoms driven by a monochromatic coherent microwave field in the presence of noise  @xcite , open quantum systems under the influence of strong laser fields  @xcite , driven dissipative quantum tunneling  @xcite , and , more recently , degenerate bose gases driven far from equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "in particular , breuer _ et al .",
    "_ have emphasized the existence of a quasistationary distribution of floquet - state occupation probabilities to which the system relaxes in the long - time limit under the combined effect of the time - periodic force and the heat bath  @xcite ; this line of investigation has been taken up by ketzmerick and wustmann with a detailed view on the classical - quantum correspondence  @xcite . even in this steady state",
    ", energy is continuously being fed by the driving force into the system and transported to the bath , where it is dissipated .",
    "this steady - state energy flow is one of the most important quantities characterizing a time - periodically driven open quantum system .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the calculation of the energy dissipation rate from a conceptual point of view .",
    "we employ a golden rule - type perturbational approach which tends to gloss over certain theoretical details showing up in more elaborate treatments based on a lindblad master equation  @xcite , but which yields the same results when the born - markov approximation is made , and which has the merit of making the physical content of the central expression  ( [ eq : edr ] ) for the energy dissipation rate particularly transparent .",
    "we proceed as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we discuss the golden rule for transitions among floquet states .",
    "although this is already implicitly contained in previous works  @xcite we here give a detailed derivation , since this approach is capable of some generalizations .",
    "we then use this golden rule in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] for deriving the energy dissipation rate for a time - periodically driven quantum system interacting with a thermal heat bath of harmonic oscillators . here",
    "we distinguish between a contribution due to pseudo - transitions , which do not change the system s floquet state , and the one due to genuine floquet transitions .",
    "in the subsequent two sections we study two analytically solvable model systems , with emphasis placed on the connection between the dissipation rate and the ac stark shift . in sec .  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we briefly reconsider the linearly forced harmonic oscillator  @xcite , which shows a fairly uncommon feature : all its quasienergy levels exhibit exactly the same ac stark shift , so that the energy dissipation rate is entirely due to the pseudo - transitions .",
    "in contrast , the two - level system interacting with a circularly polarized radiation field investigated in sec .  [ sec:5 ] possesses a more generic level response , and a correspondingly richer dissipation pattern .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in the final sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] .",
    "consider a quantum system governed for times @xmath0 by a hamiltonian @xmath1 which is periodic in time with period  @xmath2 , @xmath3 so that we have the schrdinger equation @xmath4 for @xmath0 .",
    "we assume this system to possess a complete set of square - integrable floquet states , that is , particular wave functions of the form  @xcite @xmath5 with real quasienergies @xmath6 and floquet functions @xmath7 which inherit the periodicity of their hamiltonian , @xmath8 the general solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sgl ] ) then takes the form of a superposition of these states , @xmath9 with coefficients @xmath10 which remain constant in time .",
    "this has the physically appealing consequence that one can assign constant occupation probabilities @xmath11 to the floquet states , despite the hamiltonian s explicit time - dependence .",
    "an additional perturbation acting on the system for @xmath12 will then induce transitions among the floquet states , so that one can ask how their occupation numbers change in response to that perturbation , _",
    "i.e. _ , what the corresponding transition probabilities are ; this is the question that will be tackled in the present section .",
    "the proposition concerning the existence of such floquet states  ( [ eq : fst ] ) involves some mathematical subtleties which narrow down the range of systems to which the following deliberations can be applied rigorously , and which therefore deserve to be spelled out in some detail .",
    "these complications derive from a simple observation : defining @xmath13 , one has the obvious identity @xmath14 t/\\hbar ) \\ ; ,   \\label{eq : fac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath15 again is periodic in time with period  @xmath2 , if @xmath16 is any positive or negative integer .",
    "thus , the separation of a floquet state  ( [ eq : fst ] ) into a periodic function @xmath7 and its floquet multiplier @xmath17 is not unique : one is always free to choose any integer @xmath16 , and then to replace @xmath7 by @xmath15 , if one simultaneously replaces @xmath6 by @xmath18 .",
    "that is , in contrast to the energy of an eigenstate of some time - independent hamiltonian a quasienergy is not defined uniquely , but only up to an integer multiple of @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , one could factorize the floquet states such that all quasienergies fall into the `` first brillouin zone '' @xmath20 .",
    "it needs to be stressed , however , that this procedure would merely be a matter of convention and other choices are equally possible : as long as one considers the full floquet states  ( [ eq : fst ] ) , rather than floquet functions and quasienergies separately , the particular choice of the integer  @xmath16 involved in the formal factorization  ( [ eq : fac ] ) is devoid of any significance .    nonetheless , this brillouin - zone structure of the quasienergy spectrum is the root of severe mathematical difficulties .",
    "namely , assume that the hamiltonian has the natural form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 defines an `` unperturbed system '' on which a time - periodic influence @xmath23 acts with adjustable strength  @xmath24 .",
    "then for @xmath25 the system s quasienergy spectrum consists of the energy eigenvalues of @xmath22 , taken modulo @xmath19 .",
    "assuming further that @xmath22 possesses infinitely many discrete energy eigenvalues , the corresponding quasienergy spectrum of @xmath1 for @xmath25 generically covers the entire energy axis densely .",
    "the decisive question then is whether the quasienergy spectrum still remains a dense pure point spectrum when @xmath26 , or whether it becomes continuous : in the first case the sum expansion  ( [ eq : sum ] ) is to be taken literally , so that the system s wave function is strictly quasiperiodic in time , whereas in the second case the continuous quasienergy spectrum gives rise to diffusive energy growth  @xcite .",
    "this question concerning the nature of the quasienergy spectrum of periodically time - dependent quantum systems is known as the `` quantum stability problem ''  @xcite ; since its solution heavily involves operator - theoretic versions of the kolmogorov - arnold - moser theorem , it has drawn substantial interest in mathematical physics . along this line of research ,",
    "an important rigorous result is due to howland : provided the gap between successive energy eigenvalues of @xmath22 grows sufficiently rapidly , and @xmath27 is bounded , the quasienergy spectrum pertaining to @xmath28 has no absolutely continuous component  @xcite ; this finding has later been generalized by joye  @xcite . wishing to avoid unnecessary mathematical complications , but still aiming at physically meaningful statements , we restrict ourselves to such systems which do not admit an absolutely continuous quasienergy spectrum .",
    "the remaining class of systems still includes interesting and important models such as linearly forced anharmonic oscillators with superquadratic potentials  @xcite , or , as a limiting case , the `` driven particle in a box ''  @xcite .",
    "we now stipulate that the system  ( [ eq : sgl ] ) be prepared in an individual floquet state @xmath29 for @xmath0 , and then subjected to some perturbation @xmath30 with an arbitrary time - dependence for @xmath12 , so that the evolution of the wave functions is given by @xmath31 for @xmath12 . in order to set up time - dependent perturbation theory within the floquet framework",
    ", we adapt the standard textbook reasoning for evaluating transitions between energy eigenstates  @xcite : we introduce the time - evolution operator @xmath32 of the unperturbed , periodically time - dependent system  ( [ eq : sgl ] ) , which obeys the equation @xmath33 with the initial condition @xmath34 , and then employ this operator for transforming the wave functions @xmath35 to a floquet - interaction picture by means of the relation @xmath36 the transformed wave function @xmath37 then evolves according to the equation @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the perturbation operator transformed to the interaction picture , leading to the exact integral equation @xmath40 it may be helpful to point out the rationale underlying this procedure : one might likewise convert the original evolution equation  ( [ eq : fsg ] ) into an integral equation , thus remaining fully within the schrdinger picture ; if one could solve that equation exactly the detour to the interaction picture were dispensable .",
    "however , the actual benefit of integral equations of the type  ( [ eq : int ] ) lies in the fact that they lend themselves to an iterative solution , leading to a neumann series  @xcite .",
    "then the interaction picture offers a tremendous advantage over the schrdinger picture : since the norm of the integral operator on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) is determined by the assumedly small perturbation @xmath41 , the convergence properties of its formal series solution can be expected to be significantly better than those of the corresponding series obtained in the schrdinger picture .",
    "therefore , one may obtain acceptable approximations when terminating the interaction - picture neumann series at low orders ; in this sense the floquet - interaction picture shares the virtues of the usual interaction picture employed in time - dependent perturbation theory  @xcite .    for computing the probability of a transition from the initial floquet state @xmath29 to some final floquet state @xmath42",
    "we require the projections @xmath43 at this point , the fact that the unperturbed hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) depends _ periodically _ on time becomes decisive : while in the case of an arbitrary time - dependence the evolution operator @xmath32 would have to be expressed as a time - ordered exponential  @xcite , here we have the floquet representation @xmath44 giving @xmath45 to first order in @xmath46 , the solution to the integral equation  ( [ eq : int ] ) now reads @xmath47 inserting the definition  ( [ eq : udf ] ) and again utilizing the floquet representation  ( [ eq : ufl ] ) , one evaluates @xmath48 from which we immediately obtain the desired transition probability @xmath49 for @xmath50 to lowest order in the perturbation  @xmath46 : @xmath51 the apparent similarity of this result to the corresponding expression for transition probabilities among energy eigenstates  @xcite once again emphasizes the fact that in periodically time - dependent quantum systems the floquet states take over the role which the energy eigenstates play in a system governed by a time - independent hamiltonian .    to proceed , we assume that the perturbation is instantaneously switched on at time @xmath52 and then stays constant , @xmath53 expanding the floquet functions into fourier series , @xmath54 we obtain the floquet transition matrix elements in the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : ftp ] ) yields the transition probabilities @xmath57 when evaluating the squared sum , the cross - terms average to zero over a few cycles , so that one is left with @xmath58 for intervals  @xmath59 which are , on the one hand , sufficiently long to allow for the replacement of the above squared sinc functions by delta distributions , but remain sufficiently short to justify the first - order approximation  ( [ eq : foa ] ) on the other .",
    "this expression  ( [ eq : fgr ] ) constitutes the desired analog of the `` golden rule '' for transitions among floquet states .",
    "because each floquet state brings its own set of fourier components  ( [ eq : foc ] ) into the dynamics , a transition @xmath60 does not merely correspond to a single spectral line , but rather to a series of lines equally spaced by @xmath19 , being weighted with the squared sum  ( [ eq : fme ] ) of the components matrix elements .",
    "to take the next step , we imagine that the system described by @xmath1 is coupled to an environment conforming to a hamiltonian @xmath61 . with @xmath1 acting on the system s hilbert space @xmath62 , and @xmath61 acting on the space @xmath63 pertaining to the environmental degrees of freedom",
    ", the total hamiltonian @xmath64 then is defined on the product space @xmath65 . here",
    "we take the coupling to be of the form @xmath66 with @xmath46 carrying the dimension of an energy , so that @xmath67 is dimensionless . the previous reasoning leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fgr ] ) can then easily be adapted : assuming @xmath61 to possess eigenstates @xmath68 with energies @xmath69 , we have the replacements @xmath70 thus obtaining the rates @xmath71 for individual system - environment transitions",
    "@xmath72 , where @xmath73 , and @xmath74 denotes the frequencies associated with the system s floquet transition @xmath60 .",
    "note that our approach neglects a second - order shift of the quasienergies which is induced by the interaction with the environment , but usually is quite small  @xcite . in the following we",
    "restrict ourselves to environments which can be described as a `` heat bath '' consisting of a very large number of thermally occupied harmonic oscillators  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , @xmath75 is a sum over all bath annihilation operators @xmath76 and their adjoint creation operators @xmath77",
    ". we then have to distinguish two cases : if @xmath78 , so that the system gains the energy @xmath79 while the bath is de - excited and a bath phonon of frequency @xmath80 is annihilated , one has @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the initial occupation number of the bath oscillator involved in the transition . if , on the other hand , @xmath83 , so that the system loses energy to the bath and a phonon of frequency @xmath80 is created , one obtains @xmath84 therefore , introducing the appropriate thermally averaged quantities  @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 specifies the temperature  @xmath2 of the oscillator bath , and invoking its spectral density @xmath87 , the total rate @xmath88 of bath - induced floquet transitions @xmath60 can be written as a sum , @xmath89 with partial rates being given by @xmath90 at this point , let us briefly check the consequences of factorizing the floquet states @xmath91 in different manners : if one replaces , for instance , @xmath92 by @xmath93 , and @xmath94 by @xmath95 with arbitrary integer  @xmath16 , the matrix elements  ( [ eq : fme ] ) are relabeled to read @xmath96 , while the transition frequencies  ( [ eq : ofi ] ) are referred to as @xmath97 , both retaining their numerical values .",
    "thus , the net effect of this replacement is a relabeling of @xmath98 to @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , the choice of the representative of each floquet function , that is , the choice of the respective integer  @xmath16 , merely is a matter of convenience .",
    "asking now for the steady - state distribution @xmath100 of floquet - state occupation probabilities @xmath101 which establishes itself under the influence of the bath , one has to solve the pauli - type master equation  @xcite @xmath102 into which only the total rates  ( [ eq : tfr ] ) enter .",
    "however , when asking for the rate  @xmath103 of energy dissipated in this steady state , a more detailed view is required : as emphasized in the above derivation , a partial rate @xmath98 belongs to a transition over the course of which the system acquires the energy @xmath104 from the bath .",
    "therefore , the desired dissipation rate is determined by the sum over all these partial rates , each weighted with the occupation probability @xmath105 of the respective inital state , and multiplied by the energy @xmath106 lost to the bath : @xmath107 it will be of interest for the subsequent discussion to observe that this dissipation rate  ( [ eq : edr ] ) can naturally be decomposed into two parts : one contribution arising from genuine transitions @xmath108 between _ different _ floquet states @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and another one due to the `` pseudo - transitions '' @xmath111 . the former contribution is written as @xmath112 where the prime at the sum sign is meant to enforce the condition @xmath113 , whereas the latter takes the form @xmath114 having used @xmath115 in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ofi ] ) .",
    "since the diagonal matrix element @xmath116 is real , its fourier component @xmath117 equals the complex conjugate of @xmath118 . observing further that the definition  ( [ eq : dno ] ) implies @xmath119 for @xmath120 , we find @xmath121 thus , the pseudo - transitions yield a positive contribution to the dissipation rate , and make sure that energy is dissipated even in those cases in which the bath - induced genuine floquet transitions do not figure .",
    "an unusually simple , but still quite instructive model system is provided by a particle of mass  @xmath122 which is moving in a one - dimensional quadratic potential with oscillation frequency  @xmath123 while being subjected to a sinusoidal force with amplitude  @xmath124 and angular frequency  @xmath125 , as described in the position representation by the hamiltonian @xmath126 the construction of its floquet states follows a route laid out by husimi  @xcite : with @xmath127 , let @xmath128 be the @xmath2-periodic solution to the classical equation of motion @xmath129 namely , @xmath130 then the solutions to the time - dependent schrdinger equation are given by superpositions of the wave functions @xmath131 \\big ) \\ ; ,     \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath132 is an oscillator eigenfunction with energy @xmath133 , and @xmath134 denotes the classical lagrangian of the system , evaluated along the @xmath2-periodic trajectory  ( [ eq : tpt ] ) .",
    "the floquet functions @xmath135 and their quasienergies @xmath6 are then easily obtained by extracting the component increasing linearly with time from the phase of the solutions  ( [ eq : fso ] ) , giving  @xcite @xmath136 \\big )     \\label{eq : off}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath137 this latter result  ( [ eq : qeo ] ) expresses a peculiarity of the harmonic oscillator : all its states respond in the same manner to the external force , that is , all its energy levels exhibit precisely the same ac stark shift proportional to the square of the driving amplitude .",
    "imposing now a dipole - type interaction of the form @xmath138 the fact that the floquet functions  ( [ eq : off ] ) essentially are harmonic - oscillator eigenfunctions following the classical trajectory  ( [ eq : tpt ] ) without change of shape greatly facilitates the calculation of the required matrix elements  @xcite : @xmath139 this expression provides the matrix elements @xmath140 , and therefore allows one to determine the partial rates  ( [ eq : ptr ] ) . on the one hand ,",
    "the only nonzero rates associated with genuine floquet transitions are @xmath141 on the other , each pseudo - transition @xmath111 is characterized by the two partial rates @xmath142 now the master equation  ( [ eq : gme ] ) determining the quasistationary floquet distribution @xmath100 takes the form @xmath143 adding the corresponding equation for @xmath144 effectuates an enhancement of the label  @xmath109 in the second bracket by one .",
    "iterating this procedure , one deduces that the two brackets in this equation  ( [ eq : meo ] ) have to vanish individually , giving @xmath145 evidently , the uncommon feature that the total rates  ( [ eq : tfr ] ) consist , for this particular system  ( [ eq : dho ] ) , of only one partial rate ensures detailed balance of the floquet transitions  @xcite , so that the quasistationary floquet occupation probabilities are given by a geometric boltzmann distribution : @xmath146 for @xmath147 , while @xmath148 moreover , the fact that all quasienergies  ( [ eq : qeo ] ) differ from the unperturbed oscillator energies by the same ac stark shift allows one to express this distribution as a boltzmann distribution over these quasienergy levels  @xcite : @xmath149 with the partition function @xmath150 hence , the quasistationary floquet distribution equals the canonical equilibrium distribution , regardless of the driving force .    turning now to the energy dissipation rate in this steady state , the contribution  ( [ eq : etr ] ) due to the genuine transitions here becomes @xmath151 which , in view of the detailed - balance condition  ( [ eq : dbl ] ) , reduces to @xmath152 .",
    "but there still remains the contribution  ( [ eq : cpt ] ) due to the pseudo - transitions : @xmath153 since now eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ppr ] ) yield @xmath154 the sum over @xmath109 corresponds to the normalization condition @xmath155 , giving @xmath156 thus , we have a fairly complete description of the energy flow through the driven harmonic oscillator  ( [ eq : dho ] ) : while the steady floquet distribution  ( [ eq : sso ] ) equals the thermal boltzmann distribution over the unperturbed energy eigenstates for all parameters of the driving force , there is a continuous flow of energy through the system into the bath , which acts as an energy sink .",
    "this energy flow  ( [ eq : ofl ] ) is entirely due to pseudo - transitions which preserve the floquet state , as expressed by the fact that the spectral density in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ofl ] ) is to be evaluated at the driving frequency @xmath157 , not at the oscillator frequency  @xmath123 .",
    "the dissipation rate does not depend on the temperature of the bath , but grows quadratically with the driving amplitude , and becomes singular when the driving frequency approaches the oscillator frequency .",
    "a two - level system interacting with a circularly polarized monochromatic classical radiation field , as described by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath158 defines a further analytically solvable model which , in spite of its quite minimalistic appearance , is already able to reveal several generic features of the energy dissipation mechanism .",
    "here @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 denote the usual pauli matrices  @xcite , and @xmath124 quantifies the strength of the radiation field mode with frequency  @xmath157 which couples to the bare two - level system with a constant  @xmath162 .",
    "thus , the energy eigenvalues of the unperturbed system are @xmath163 , so that @xmath123 is the frequency of transitions between these bare levels .",
    "the formal simplicity of this model  ( [ eq : tls ] ) is deceptive ; in fact , its dynamics are by far richer than those of the driven harmonic oscillator  ( [ eq : dho ] ) .",
    "with the help of the rabi frequency @xmath164 where @xmath165 denotes the detuning of the driving frequency  @xmath157 from the bare transition frequency  @xmath123 , the floquet states of the driven two - level system  ( [ eq : tls ] ) take the form  @xcite @xmath166 from these states we split off the floquet functions @xmath167 implying that the corresponding quasienergies read @xmath168 now an important distinction has to be made : if @xmath169 , so that the driving frequency is detuned to the red side of the bare transition , these quasienergies reduce to @xmath170 in the limit @xmath171 of vanishing driving amplitude .",
    "in contrast , when the radiation field is blue - detuned and @xmath172 , these limits are given by @xmath173 thus , the floquet state labeled by `` @xmath174 '' exhibits a quasienergy which _ increases _ monotonically with increasing amplitude  @xmath124 ; this state is continuously connected to the _ excited _ state of the bare two - level system when @xmath169 , and to its _ ground _ state when @xmath172 ; vice versa for the floquet state labeled by `` @xmath175 ''",
    ". expressed differently , the ac stark shift of the two levels changes _ qualitatively _ when @xmath176 changes its sign : as indicated in fig .  1 , the two levels repel each other with increasing amplitude in the case of red detuning , whereas they approach each other and cross for blue detuning .",
    "this characteristic behavior also leaves its traces in the energy dissipation rate .      for modeling the system s coupling to the bath , we choose @xmath177 for simplicity , here we take the spectral density  @xmath178 of the bath to be constant .",
    "the floquet functions  ( [ eq : tff ] ) readily yield the matrix elements @xmath179 possessing only two nonvanishing fourier components @xmath180 likewise , one finds @xmath181 for evaluating the partial rates  ( [ eq : ptr ] ) we need to know the sign of the associated transition frequencies @xmath182 , in order to resolve the distinction made in the definition  ( [ eq : dno ] ) of @xmath183 . assuming @xmath184 , eq .",

    "( [ eq : pmg ] ) then implies @xmath200 for @xmath201 : for any finite temperature of the bath , the floquet state with a `` downward '' ac stark shift will acquire all the population in the strong - forcing limit , regardless of whether this state is connected to the ground state or to the excited state of the bare two - level system in the opposite limit of vanishing driving amplitude .",
    "figure  [ f_2 ] depicts @xmath202 vs.  @xmath199 for @xmath203 , as corresponding to the ac stark shift indicated by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "for low scaled temperature @xmath204 the state labeled `` @xmath175 '' , here being connected to the excited state of the bare system , naturally is almost unpopulated when @xmath205 , but it accepts practically the entire population when @xmath206 . for higher temperatures the `` @xmath175''-state carries more population already in the weak - driving regime , and the crossover to the limit @xmath207 is less pronounced , but this limit is approached with arbitrarily small deviation when @xmath199 becomes large enough .",
    "if it were feasible to decouple the system from the heat bath at will , this would open up interesting heating and cooling schemes : suppose than an ensemble of two - level systems is strongly driven , and that the ensemble s contact with the heat bath is disabled when @xmath208 . if one then switches off the driving amplitude smoothly , the adiabatic principle for floquet states  @xcite guarantees that the value of @xmath202 remains practically unchanged . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath209 one obtains an `` ultrahot '' ensemble of bare two - level systems , with more or less all of its members being in the excited energy eigenstate at the end of the switch - off , whereas the final state would be an `` ultracold '' ensemble of two - level systems in their ground states when @xmath210 .",
    "another remarkable feature revealed by the steady - state occupation probabilities  ( [ eq : pml ] ) and ( [ eq : pmg ] ) is their low - temperature limit in the presence of the drive : when @xmath188 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pmg ] ) simply yields @xmath211 for @xmath212 ; in this case the `` @xmath175''-state carries all the population for vanishing bath temperature .",

    "however , for finite nonzero driving strength matching the condition @xmath213 , none of the two floquet states can accept all the population at zero temperature .",
    "the physics behind this finding becomes clear if one takes the limit of vanishing temperature already at the level of the partial rates ( [ eq : prl ] ) and ( [ eq : prg ] ) : for both @xmath213 and @xmath188 eq .",

    "( [ eq : prg ] ) @xmath219 hence , @xmath220 goes to zero in this case @xmath188 , while @xmath221 remains nonzero .",
    "therefore , at very low temperatures the driven system can still undergo transitions from `` @xmath174 '' to `` @xmath175 '' , but not back from `` @xmath175 '' to `` @xmath174 '' , so that eventually all the population piles up in the `` @xmath175''-state .",

    "( [ eq : ltl ] ) from the above rates .",

    "next , the contribution of the genuine floquet transitions is rearranged to read @xmath230 now the equation  ( [ eq : mpm ] ) for @xmath202 effectuates the cancellation of the terms proportional to @xmath231 , and after some algebra one arrives at @xmath232 with @xmath233 where @xmath234 ( @xmath235 ) is the larger ( smaller ) of the two frequencies @xmath229 and @xmath157 ; recall that this quantity @xmath236 also appears in the denonimator of the steady - state occupation probabilities ( [ eq : pml ] ) and ( [ eq : pmg ] ) .",
    "in contrast to @xmath237 , this dissipation rate  ( [ eq : rgt ] ) caused by the genuine floquet transitions does depend on the temperature of the bath .",
    "adding the two contributions , we finally obtain the total dissipation rate @xmath238 \\ ; .\\ ] ] considering finite nonzero temperatures , this total dissipation rate evidently approaches a finite value determined solely by the pseudo - transitions in the strong - forcing regime , @xmath239 whereas it vanishes in the high - frequency limit , @xmath240    in fig .",
    "[ f_3 ] we plot the normalized ( dimensionless ) rate @xmath241 for precisely the cases studied previously in fig .",
    "[ f_2 ] , that is , for @xmath203 and various scaled temperatures ; here the approach to the strong - forcing limit  ( [ eq : sfl ] ) is already recognizable for @xmath242 .",
    "a better understanding of the non - monotonic behavior of these curves is obtained if one investigates the dependence of the dissipation rate on the driving frequency at fixed driving amplitude , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f_4 ] : for low driving amplitudes conforming to @xmath243 one has a broad resonance at about @xmath244 and a further , narrow resonance at @xmath245 , which condition is equivalent to @xmath246 both resonances merge when @xmath247 ; for still higher driving amplitudes there is only one single , broad maximum of the dissipation rate at a position determined mainly by the pseudo - transitions , located at @xmath248 in the strong - forcing regime .    once again , the limiting case of vanishing bath temperature merits special attention : when @xmath188 one deduces @xmath249 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rgt ] ) , but when @xmath213 we find @xmath250 thus , in the zero - temperature limit the genuine floquet transitions do not figure when @xmath188 , but they do yield a finite contribution to the total dissipation rate when @xmath213 .",
    "this distinction evidently matches the behavior of the steady - state occupation probabilities discussed at the end of the previous subsection .",
    "the concept of `` periodic thermodynamics ''  @xcite implies that the steady state to which a quantum system relaxes in the presence of both a time - periodic driving force and a heat bath continuously delivers energy to the bath .",
    "the calculation of this steady - state energy dissipation rate , which we have outlined here for an harmonic - oscillator bath , reveals some peculiar features : whereas the steady - state occupation probabilities are determined by a pauli - type master equation into which only the rates for the genuine floquet transitions enter  @xcite , the dissipation rate  ( [ eq : edr ] ) also incorporates the contribution  ( [ eq : eps ] ) from processes during which the bath energy changes by an integer multiple of @xmath19 , while the system s floquet state is left unchanged ; these processes have been dubbed pseudo - transitions .",
    "moreover , only the total rates  ( [ eq : tfr ] ) embodying _ all _ floquet transition frequencies show up in the master equation , whereas the evaluation of the dissipation rate  ( [ eq : edr ] ) requires the knowledge of the individual partial rates  ( [ eq : ptr ] ) .    the example of the driven harmonic oscillator considered in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] is quite instructive insofar as it shows what does _ not _ happen in generic cases : for this particular model the total transition rates  ( [ eq : ogt ] ) for the genuine transitions consist of only one partial rate , which implies that detailed balance still holds and the steady - state floquet distribution equals the thermal boltzmann distribution  @xcite ; in addition , here the dissipation rate is given entirely by the pseudo - transitions .",
    "the study of the circularly forced two - level system performed in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] has demonstrated that the steady - state dynamics are substantially more involved when the bare energy levels of the driven system exhibit a nontrivial ac stark shift .",
    "the features encountered here will also show up , multiply superimposed , in non - integrable systems which require numerical treatment  @xcite . particularly noteworthy",
    "is the fact that even in contact with a zero - temperature bath a time - periodically driven system does not necessarily occuply only one single floquet state , as exemplified by the two - level model in the regime @xmath213 .    with a view towards future applications , the observations made at the end of subsec .",
    "[ subsec:5b ] might merit further investigations and generalizations .",
    "the steady - state floquet distribution which establishes itself in the presence of the driving force may be preserved by decoupling the bath and switching off the driving amplitude adiabatically ; the resulting state then can contain either more or even less energy than a stationary thermal state .",
    "thus , as a matter of principle it seems possible to achieve cooling by driving ."
