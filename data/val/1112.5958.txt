    "the characteristic energy scale is relatively small , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 being the mass of the @xmath1-lepton ) .",
    "hence , the non - perturbative effects of qcd can not be completely ignored . the original study @xcite",
    "has shown that they are small and under control within the ope . in the following years",
    ", the inclusive hadronic quantities of the @xmath1 system have been intensively exploited to precisely determine the strong coupling constant @xmath14 .",
    "this became feasible because the observables of the @xmath1 system are sensitive to the concrete value of @xmath0 and the accuracy of the experimental data for a variety of the observables has been considerably improved ( for recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "in past few years , the determination of the strong coupling constant from non - strange hadronic @xmath1-data has received a renewed interest .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that there is not good agreement between recent two highest precision low - energy determinations of @xmath0 .",
    "these determinations come from the finite energy sum rule ( fesr ) analysis of hadronic @xmath1 decay data @xcite and from a lattice perturbation theory analysis of ultraviolet - sensitive lattice observables @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 moreover , different determinations of @xmath0 from the same @xmath1 data @xcite are not fully consistent within their mutual errors ( see work @xcite and the literature therein ) . this discrepancy has stimulated a number of new theoretical investigations on the application of the fesr in @xmath1 decays ( see works @xcite .",
    "the standard fesr technique based on the truncated ope series has been reconsidered .",
    "the small but still significant non - perturbative effects have been included into analysis @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , the impact of the higher order terms of the ope ( neglected in the standard analyzes ) has been estimated @xcite .",
    "it was confirmed that their influence on the extracted value of @xmath0 is not small in the separate vector and axial vector channels . to suppress these contributions in the fesr the so - called pinched weights introduced @xcite . on the second hand , using the physically motivated model @xcite the impact of the non - perturbative corrections coming from the possible duality violations ( dvs ) @xcite has been estimated . in the separate vector and axial vector channels the dvs was found to be appreciable ( see recent work @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the pinched weights have also been employed to reduce the effects of dvs @xcite .",
    "possible non - perturbative corrections to the fesr ( direct instantons , duality violation and tachyonic gluon mass ) which can not be described within the ope have been estimated in @xcite .",

    "note that the non - physical singularities of the perturbative running coupling ( the landau pole problem ) which occur at small space - like momenta may , supposedly , deteriorate the extracted values of the parameters @xcite . in particular , cipt suffers from this shortcoming @xcite . to cope with this problem dispersive or analytic approaches to perturbative qcd",
    "have been developed @xcite . in works",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the @xmath1 lepton decay rate has been analyzed within a simple and effective dispersive technique , analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the minimal analytic qcd model ( the same apt ) predicts , from the non - strange @xmath1 lepton decay data , too large value for the strong coupling constant , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the advantages and shortcomings of the three approaches to the @xmath1 decays ( fopt , cipt and apt ) were thoroughly analyzed in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that apt as well as its generalized versions suggested more later @xcite proved to be very useful from the phenomenological point of view . a remarkable feature of these modified expansions is the better convergence and improved stability property with respect to change of the renormalization scheme .",
    "nevertheless , one should keep in mind that an analytic approach based only on perturbation theory can not be defined unambiguously , in fact , there is not a unique recipe for removing the landau singularities from the running coupling .    in our earlier work @xcite",
    "we have suggested a dispersive approach to analyze the @xmath1 decay data .",
    "in contrast to cipt , the new approach is based on the improved approximations to the adler function which incorporate correct analyticity and rg invariance properties of the exact function .",
    "moreover , the approximations correctly reproduce the required ultraviolet and infrared properties of the exact adler function .",
    "another feature of the new framework is the use of the quark - hadron duality in the limited region @xmath2 .",

    "let us briefly recall some basic facts about the qcd analysis of the hadronic decays of the @xmath1-lepton through the fesr @xcite .",
    "the non - strange vector component of the @xmath1-hadronic width is determined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath21 is the flavor ckm matrix element , @xmath22 denotes a short - distance electroweak correction . ] and @xmath23 is the vector spectral function defined through the correlation function . ]",
    "@xmath24 it is more convenient to define a renormalization scale invariant quantity , the adler function @xmath25 here , we have defined @xmath26 . in the exact theory , the correlation function @xmath27 and the adler function are analytic functions except the cut running along negative @xmath28-axis .",
    "this implies the fesr relation @xmath29 here , the integration contour is a circle of radius @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) . in the case of massless quarks ,",
    "the adler function has the perturbation theory expansion @xcite @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 denotes the strong coupling constant normalized at the scale @xmath35 .",
    "it follows from the renormalization scale invariance of the adler function that only the coefficients @xmath36 are independent .",
    "all other coefficients are determined in terms of the @xmath36 and @xmath37-function coefficients through the rg equation @xcite . in practice",
    "the series ( [ series1 ] ) is truncated at some finite order .",
    "the approximations to the adler function obtained by truncation of the series ( [ series1 ] ) have correct analytical properties of the exact function . in the case of fopt ,",
    "the series ( [ series1 ] ) is inserted into contour integral ( [ fesr ] ) and integrated term - by - term .",
    "afterwards , the normalization scale is determined choosing @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "however , we could start from the original formula ( [ rate ] ) with perturbation theory expansion for the spectral function .",
    "the expansion for the spectral function is obtained by insertion series ( [ series1 ] ) into inversion formula ( [ inverse ] ) ( see below ) and integrating term - by - term .",
    "so , we could achieve the same result without using the fesr relation ( [ fesr ] ) .",
    "thus , within fopt , formulas ( [ rate ] ) and ( [ fesr ] ) are equivalent .",
    "however , the approximations to the adler function employed within fopt do not describe correctly the asymptotic behavior of the exact function for @xmath39 . in the standard analysis of the @xmath1 data",
    "this fact is irrelevant .",
    "however , as we shall see latter , this is not the case for the new framework accepted in this paper .",
    "since the adler function is the renormalization scale invariant quantity , one may choose @xmath40 in series ( [ series1 ] ) .",
    "thus , one obtains the rg improved expansion @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 being the running coupling .",
    "the first two coefficients in the expansion ( [ series2 ] ) are the renormalization scheme invariant .",
    "the known coefficients in the @xmath4 scheme for @xmath45 quark flavors take values @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the last coefficient was calculated recently by the authors of @xcite by using powerful computational techniques .",
    "the approximations to the adler function constructed by truncation the series ( [ series2 ] ) have correct ultraviolet asymptotical behavior ( @xmath50 as @xmath51 ) , however they violate the cut - plane analyticity of the exact adler function due to the non - physical landau singularities of the perturbative running coupling .",
    "one may assume , without loss of generality , that the running coupling has only one landau singularity located on the positive @xmath52 axis @xcite . this is true for the asymptotic solutions and for more accurate lambert - w solutions to the rg equation @xcite .",
    "then we may derive ( see @xcite ) the violated dispersion relation for the qcd correction to the adler function : @xmath53 where the function @xmath54 satisfies the normal dr @xmath55 with the effective spectral density determined as @xmath56 it is to be noted here that the function @xmath57 is the analytic image of the perturbative adler function determined in the sense of the analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) approach of shirkov and solovtsov @xcite . the second term in ( [ vdr ] )",
    "is the contribution coming from the landau singularity .",
    "it is represented by the contour integral @xcite @xmath58 here , the integral is taken round the circle @xmath59 in the positive ( anti - clockwise ) direction , with @xmath60 being the landau singular point .    in the popular framework , referred to as contour improved perturbation theory ( cipt ) @xcite , the ( truncated ) expansion ( [ series2 ] ) is inserted into the fesr integral ( [ fesr ] ) and then integrated term by term . at this point , one ignores the fact that with the approximation ( [ series2 ] ) formulas ( [ rate ] ) and ( [ fesr ] ) are not equivalent .",
    "indeed , the fesr relation ( [ fesr ] ) can not be derived because of violated analytical properties of the approximation ( [ series2 ] ) .",
    "this inadequacy repeatedly discussed in the literature ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , cipt has been very successful from the phenomenological point of view . on the other hand ,",
    "apt is free from this drawback .",
    "however , the analysis of the @xmath1 decay data based on apt with massless quarks gave too large value for the strong coupling constant @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the infrared region , the adler function can not be reproduced correctly within apt , cipt or fopt .",
    "thus , in apt the running coupling @xmath61 has a finite limit as @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "this leads to the apparent contradiction in the case of the adler function .",
    "in fact , the adler function should vanish at @xmath63 , as is manifested by chiral perturbation theory @xcite . in work @xcite ,",
    "apt has been modified by considering the quark mass threshold effects for the light quarks . in this way , correct descriptions of the adler function and @xmath1 data was achieved .",
    "however , too large values for the effective quark masses ( @xmath64 ) was predicted .",
    "as is well known , in the exact theory the adler function satisfies the dispersion relation ( dr ) @xmath65 the corresponding inversion formula reads @xmath66 where the path of integration , connecting the points @xmath67 on the complex @xmath28-plane , avoids the cut running along the real negative z axis .",
    "the integral being traversed in a positive ( anticlockwise ) sense . from the violated dr ( [ vdr ] ) , we may also derive the integral representation @xmath68 where the singular integral at the lower bound should be treated in the sense of distribution theory . ) in the case of the one - loop order @xmath37-function . ]",
    "it is to be noted that the spectral function @xmath69 may be again calculated via the inversion formula ( [ inverse ] ) , but now the integration contour should also avoid the non - physical cut running along the positive interval @xmath70 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .     plane used in the inversion formula ( [ inverse ] ) in the case of the approximation @xmath71 violating the dr .",
    "branch points on the real axis are represented by the blobs and branch cuts by the zigzagging lines .",
    "@xmath72 denotes the landau singularity . ]    the dispersion relation ( [ adler ] ) may be used to construct the approximations to the adler function with correct analyticity properties . to approximate the hadronic spectral function ,",
    "one may use the global duality _ ansatz _ employed previously in works @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the perturbation theory approximation to the spectral function , @xmath75 denotes the non - perturbative component of the spectral function confined , presumably , in the low energy region , and @xmath3 is the onset of perturbative continuum , an infrared boundary in minkowski region above which we trust pqcd .. ] one may also construct a `` semi - experimental '' spectral function @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the genuine experimental part of the total `` semi - experimental '' spectral function .",

    "formula ( [ gd ] ) extends the spectral function beyond the range accessible in the experiment",

    "this _ ansatz _ was used to determine the duality point @xmath3 for a given value of @xmath79 , the qcd scale parameter in the @xmath4 scheme .",
    "the perturbative component @xmath74 was constructed from the fopt series ( [ series1 ] ) choosing the normalization scale @xmath80 .",
    "such a framework may be considered as a modification of fopt . in @xcite , we have used the same _ ansatz _ for the spectral function . however , our strategy was somewhat different .",
    "starting from the _ ansatz _ ( [ gd ] ) , we have determined the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath3 self - consistently from the @xmath1 data .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we have used the rg improved approximation @xmath81 to the spectral function .",
    "the function @xmath69 is calculated by insertion of the ( truncated ) rg improved series ( [ series2 ] ) into inversion formula ( [ inverse ] ) . for @xmath82 ,",
    "one finds @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the spectral function determined in the sense of the shirkov - solovtsov apt @xmath85    it follows from the duality relation ( [ gd ] ) that one may calculate in qcd perturbation theory the decay rate of the @xmath1 lepton into hadrons of invariant mass larger than @xmath86 @xmath87 so that @xmath88 using relation ( [ rs0 ] ) , one may express the left hand side of ( [ first ] ) in terms of the effective spectral density @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 .    inserting the duality _ ansatz _ ( [ gd ] ) into dr ( [ adler ] ) one constructs the `` semi - experimental '' adler function @xmath91 where the experimental and qcd components of the adler function are determined by @xmath92 in general , the qcd component @xmath74 may contain the non - perturbative corrections coming from the ope as well as the duality violating terms @xcite not included into the ope .",
    "intuitively , it seems to us that the non - perturbative corrections are more essential in the region @xmath93 . in what follows",
    ", we will ignore these non - perturbative corrections into qcd component of the spectral function and employ the perturbative approximation ( [ ptcomp ] ) .",

    "for this reason , we believe that dcipt provides better approximation as compared to cipt .    for comparison purposes , we have extracted the strong coupling constant from the 2005 aleph v+a data by using the rsi method of work @xcite , extending the result of @xcite up to @xmath162 ( see table [ tab:6 ] ) .",
    "good agreement between the rsi and dcipt determinations of @xmath0 has been observed .",
    "the duality point @xmath3 is found to be surprisingly stable with respect to higher order qcd corrections : @xmath163 ( see tables [ tab:2 ] and [ tab:5 ] ) . in table [ tab:5 ] , we have performed a more accurate test of stability of the numerical results , choosing consistently the orders of the approximations to the @xmath37- and adler functions .    to examine the stability of the numerical results with respect to change in the input data , we have also analyzed the 1998 opal data for the non - strange vector spectral function .",
    "the extracted values for the parameters from the aleph and opal data are found to be consistent .",
