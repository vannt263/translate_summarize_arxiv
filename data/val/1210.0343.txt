    "further evidence for the possible existence of phantoms was given in the article @xcite , where an admissible subcategory with vanishing hochschild homology but with nonzero torsion grothendieck group was produced in the derived category of the classical godeaux surface .",
    "shortly afterwards such  quasi - phantoms \" were also found on burniat surfaces by alexeev and orlov in @xcite . as we learned from s.  galkin at the conference `` birational geometry and derived categories '' in vienna in august 2012",
    ", the preprint @xcite gives some arguments that make the existence of quasi - phantoms also plausible on fake projective planes with @xmath6-divisible canonical class .",
    "however , due to the rather complicated construction of the latter surfaces , one can not yet prove this completely .    in this article",
    "we prove the existence of a phantom on a generic determinantal barlow surface @xmath7 in a small neighbourhood of @xmath8 ( the moduli space of determinantal barlow surfaces is @xmath9-dimensional , see @xcite or @xcite ) , as well as on the barlow surface @xmath0 itself .",
    "we think of @xmath10 as a deformation parameter .",
    "more precisely , our main result is the following .",
    "[ tmain ] the derived category @xmath11 of a generic determinantal barlow surface @xmath7 in a small neighbourhood of @xmath8 admits a semiorthogonal decomposition @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an exceptional sequence of line bundles and @xmath14 is a phantom category .",
    "moreover , if @xmath15 and @xmath16 are two surfaces in a small neighbourhood of a generic point of this family , then the categories @xmath17 and @xmath18 are equivalent .",
    "furthermore , @xmath19 itself has a phantom .",
    "after the discovery of the main results of this paper , we learned that gorchinskiy and orlov ( @xcite ) very recently produced another phantom category in the bounded derived category of a product of two surfaces by an ingenious and totally different method .",
    "note that by @xcite two minimal surfaces of general type with equivalent derived categories are isomorphic , so @xmath11 has to vary with the moduli of @xmath7 . the way the moduli are encoded is analogous to what happens for burniat surfaces in @xcite ( which was very inspiring for our proof )",
    "we prove that the @xmath20-yoneda algebra of the exceptional sequence does not vary in a neighbourhood of a generic determinantal barlow , and deduce from this the existence of the phantoms .",
    "note that @xmath21 is torsion free , so we can not use the torsion to prove that our exceptional sequence is not full .",
    "likewise , we do not yet know how to exhibit explicit objects in @xmath14 as was done in @xcite ( they all came from the fundamental group which is trivial here ) .",
    "it is a very interesting topic for future investigations to try to  lay hands \" on @xmath14 and try to produce explicit objects in it or even explicitly describe a strong generator .",
    "here is a short roadmap of the paper : in section [ sconstruction ] we recall the features of barlow s construction of the surface @xmath0 which we will need later . in section [ slatticetheory ]",
    "we describe the symmetry of the classes of line bundles in the exceptional sequence we are going to construct .",
    "section [ scurvesbarlow ] contains the construction of curves leading to an explicit integral basis in @xmath22 , and the description of the intersection theory pertaining to it . in section [ sexceptional ]",
    "we explain how we obtain estimates for spaces of sections of line bundles on @xmath0 and prove the existence of the length @xmath23 exceptional sequence . in section [ sdeformation ] , we compute what we call cohomology data associated to this sequence , that is , the dimensions of extension groups ( in the forward direction ) . using a deformation argument",
    ", we prove existence of phantoms . in section [ skuznetsov ] , we prove that @xmath0 itself has a phantom using kuznetsov s recent results on heights for exceptional sequences . in the last section [ sconjectures ] ,",
    "some conjectures concerning possible applications of phantom categories are presented .",

    "hence , the first object of this segment is in the original sequence and the second in the extended part .",

    "since the canonical bundle is big and nef on the barlow surface , the following statement holds .    if @xmath284 , then either @xmath285 , @xmath286 or @xmath287 is a sum of @xmath147-curves such that @xmath288 .",

    "since the length of the segment is at most 11 , we only have to consider the spaces @xmath294 for @xmath295 and @xmath296 for @xmath297 .",
    "now any circle with @xmath298 segments whose last segment is @xmath299 with @xmath300 , has the property that each of the first @xmath281 segments has relative height at least @xmath9 which , yet again , follows from lemma [ lrigidity ] . hence , any such circle has length at least @xmath116 .",
    "same reasoning holds for circles involving @xmath301 with @xmath302 .",
    "thus , we only need to consider the spaces @xmath303 and @xmath304 or , to put it differently , we have to check whether the divisors @xmath305 and @xmath306 are sums of irreducible effective @xmath147-curves .",
    "since the first divisor is @xmath307 and the second is @xmath308 , their intersection with @xmath309 is @xmath210 and the intersection with @xmath310 is @xmath116 .",
