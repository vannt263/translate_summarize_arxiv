    "the phase space of a typical hamiltonian system is a mixture of periodic , quasiperiodic and chaotic trajectories , and the stable and unstable manifolds of these trajectories .",
    "the analysis of the trajectories of those systems is central to many branches in physics , ranging from celestial mechanics to chemistry .",
    "several methods have been designed to discriminate between regular ( periodic or quasiperiodic ) and chaotic trajectories . for two degrees of freedom ,",
    "the most commonly used method is a poincar section which is a plane section of the three dimensional energy surfaces .",
    "these sections give pictures of phase space and allow to analyze qualitatively the stability properties of the system by revealing , e.g. , the invariant tori , the stable islands surrounding elliptic periodic orbits and the spatial extent of chaotic trajectories .",
    "however , these sections do not provide very accurate information and the visual inspection of these sections for higher dimensional systems is less straightforward since , e.g. , for hamiltonian systems with three degrees of freedom , these sections are four dimensional .",
    "+ much of our understanding of nonlinear systems is based on their frequencies and especially resonances between them ( perturbation theorems , intramolecular dynamics  @xcite , laskar s work in celestial mechanics  @xcite and particle accelerators  @xcite ) .",
    "one way to obtain accurate information on the stability of the system is to associate with a given trajectory an indicator such as a frequency ( in general , several indicators are associated with a given trajectory ) and construct , e.g. , a frequency representation of phase space . in this frequency space , regular regions are characterized by a very small variation of the frequency as the time interval on which this frequency is computed increases ( diffusion constant in laskar s work  @xcite ) .",
    "the main advantage of this method is that it is generalizable to systems with any number of degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "+ however , a frequency representation of the phase space does not provide the history and the local properties of a trajectory .",
    "the computation of asymptotic quantities ( such as lyapunov exponents , entropy or fractal dimensions ) does not provide dynamical information .",
    "these quantities only reflect the asymptotic behavior of the system . for many purposes infinite - time quantities are not sufficient : rather than knowing whether or not a trajectory is chaotic , it is naturally desirable to say when , where , and to what degree a trajectory is chaotic .",
    "+ in this article , we describe a method that gives a _ time - frequency _ representation of trajectories , i.e. , that provides dynamical information on the system .",
    "the idea is to follow a given trajectory and see if the phase space structures where the trajectory passes by are revealed by analyzing a single trajectory . for quasiperiodic and chaotic systems",
    ", time - frequency representation is revealing because it shows when and how motion can be trapped in some resonance zones associated with quasiperiodicity .",
    "it also show the degree of chaoticity of some part of phase space visited by the trajectory .",
    "+ in a nutshell , we associate a set of time - varying frequencies with the trajectory by decomposing it on a set of elementary functions , the wavelets , which are localized in time and frequency . wavelet decomposition has been used to analyze trajectories of hamiltonian systems in celestial mechanics  @xcite and in molecular dynamics  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the main frequency was extracted by computing the frequency curve where the modulus of the wavelet transform is maximum . however , stopping at this main frequency can give misleading or wrong information about resonance transitions .",
    "instead , we have found that the relevant information of the trajectory is contained in the _ ridges _ of the landscape formed by the magnitude of the coefficients of the time - frequency decomposition  @xcite",
    ". a ridge curve ( which has a certain time length ) corresponds to time - frequency energy localization and is also called _ instantaneous frequency _ curve .",
