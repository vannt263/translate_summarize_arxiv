    "string - like configurations arise in a great number of actual systems , such as superconductors and polymers , in theoretical models of non - abelian dynamics , such as models of qcd confinement , and as topological defects in models with spontaneous breaking of gauge or global symmetries . in some of these situations",
    "the string configurations are not absolutely stable , but are rather metastable with respect to either a complete breaking , or a break up with a string of lower tension emerging instead of the initial string .",
    "the former situation is relevant e.g. for a break up of a qcd string with formation of a quark - antiquark pair , or a formation of a monopole - antimonopole pair@xcite , and also in a whole class of theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking@xcite .",
    "the latter situation involving a phase transition between states of a string with different tension is found e.g. in abelian higgs models embedded in non - abelian theories@xcite .",
    "it is clear that the latter case is more general , since the breaking of a string into ` nothing ' can be considered as a transition into a string with zero tension .",
    "the transition of a metastable string with the tension @xmath0 to a string with a lower tension @xmath1 is quite analogous to decay of metastable vacuum@xcite , or the schwinger process of creation of pairs of charged particles by electric field@xcite . indeed ,",
    "if a piece of length @xmath3 is converted into the lower phase , the gain in the energy is @xmath4 .",
    "the barrier that inhibits the process is created by the energy @xmath5 associated with the interface between the phases of the string , e.g. the mass of the monopole in the examples of ref.@xcite or @xcite .",
    "the transition involves two such interfaces , so that the ` length ' energy gain exceeds the barrier energy @xmath6 only starting from a critical size of the ` true ' phase @xmath7 .",
    "once a critical piece has nucleated due to tunneling , the additional energy gain is spent on acceleration of the ends of this piece in its expansion , which eventually converts the whole length of the initial string .",
    "thus the probability of the transition is given by the rate of nucleation of the critical gaps in the initial string .",
    "this rate per unit time and per unit length of the metastable string is given by the semiclassical expression@xcite = c ( - ^2 _",
    "1-_2 )  , [ g0 ] where @xmath8 , the pre - exponential factor , is the main subject of the calculation in this paper .",
    "the semiclassical expression is formally applicable as long as the exponential power , determined by the action on the tunneling trajectory is large , which requires ^2 _ 1-_2  .",
    "[ muineq ]    the pre - exponential factor @xmath8 is found from a calculation of the path integral over small deviations from the semiclassical tunneling trajectory@xcite .",
    "the result of such calculation in a ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional theory , can be readily copied from the corresponding expressions in equivalent ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional problems : either that of pair creation in electric field@xcite , or of false vacuum decay@xcite , c_d=2= _ 1-_2 2  .",
    "[ c2 ] however , the equivalence of the string transition to already solved problems does not hold for string in more than two dimensions .",
    "the loss of the relation to the false vacuum decay is due to the obvious difference in the dimensionality of the relevant objects , while the loss of equivalence to the schwinger process is due to a different dependence of the action on the deviations of the tunneling trajectory in the transverse directions .",
    "indeed small deviations of the particles in the schwinger process perpendicular to the external electric field involve only the particles themselves , while a transverse displacement of an end of a string involves both the ` particle ' ( of the mass @xmath5 ) and an adjacent part of the string .",
    "in this paper we calculate the relevant path integral and find the pre - exponential coefficient for arbitrary number of space - time dimensions @xmath9 .",

    "we present our calculation starting with briefly going over the euclidean - space path integral formulation of the tunneling problem and introducing the string action and the relevant variables in sec .  2 .",
    "we then consider the separation of the variables in sec .  3 and",
    "introduce a regularization procedure in sec .",
    "the actual calculation of the path integrals is presented in sec .  5 and in sec .",
    "6 we consider the renormalization of the mass @xmath5 , associated with the interface between the strings , by the motion of adjacent pieces of the string . finally , in sec .",
    "7 we assemble our result for the transition rate and discuss the applicability and the behavior of the found formula as well as some specific points of the calculation .",
    "the tunneling trajectory can be described in the euclidean space by a configuration called the ` bounce'@xcite , which is a solution to ( euclidean ) classical equations of motion .",
    "the general expression for the effective euclidean space action for the string with the two considered phases can be written in the familiar nambu - goto form : s= p + _ 1 a_1 + _ 2 a_2  , [ a0 ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the areas of the world sheet for the two phases , and @xmath16 ( the perimeter ) is the length of the world line for the interface between them .",
    "the action ( [ a0 ] ) is an effective low - energy expression in the sense that it only describes the ` stringy ' variables and is applicable as long as the effects of thickness of the string and of its internal structure can be neglected .",
    "denoting @xmath17 the mass scale at which such approach becomes invalid ( e.g. the thickness of the string @xmath18 ) , one can write the condition for the applicability of the effective action ( [ a0 ] ) in terms of the length scale , @xmath19 , and the momentum scale @xmath20 . assuming that the initial very long string with tension @xmath0 is located along the @xmath21 axis",
    ", one can readily find that the action ( [ a0 ] ) has a nontrivial stationary configuration , the bounce , namely , that of a disk in the ( t , x ) plane occupied by the phase @xmath22 , as shown in fig.1 , with the radius r=_1-_2  , [ rc ] which is the radius ( one half of the length ) of the critical gap .",
    "the difference between the action ( [ a0 ] ) on this configuration and on the trivial one is exactly the expression for the exponential power in eq.([g0 ] ) , and the condition for applicability of the effective action ( [ a0 ] ) requires m_0 r = m_0 _ 1-_2 1  .",
    "[ rineq ] generally one also has @xmath23 , and for the strings in weakly coupled theories @xmath24 , so that the power in the exponent in eq.([g0 ] ) is large , which justifies a semiclassical treatment .",
    "the probability of the transition is determined@xcite by ( the imaginary part of ) the ratio of the path integrals @xmath25 and @xmath26 calculated with the action ( [ a0 ] ) around respectively the bounce configuration and around the initial flat string : = 1 xt  .",
    "[ rz ] it can also be reminded that , as explained in great detail in ref.@xcite , that the imaginary part of @xmath25 arises from one negative mode at the bounce configuration , and that due to two translational zero modes the numerator in eq.([rz ] ) is proportional to the total space time area @xmath27 in the @xmath28 plane occupied by the string , so that the finite quantity is the transition probability per unit time ( the rate ) and per unit length of the string .    in order to evaluate the relevant path integrals with the pre - exponential accuracy we use the cylindrical coordinates , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 being the polar variables in the @xmath28 plane ( of the bounce ) , and @xmath31 being the transverse coordinate .",
    "we consider only one transverse coordinate , since the effect of each of the extra dimensions factorizes , so that the corresponding generalization is straightforward .",
    "we further assume , for definiteness , that the space - time boundary in the @xmath28 plane is a circle of large radius @xmath32 , where the boundary condition for the string is @xmath33 .",
    "the small deviations of the string configuration from the bounce , illustrated in fig.2 , can be parametrized by the radial ( @xmath34 ) and transverse ( @xmath35 ) shifts of the boundary between the string phases : r",

    "[ bc ]    in terms of these variables the action ( [ a0 ] ) can be written in the quadratic approximation in the deviations from the bounce as & & s_12=_1 l^2 + ^2 _ 1- _ 2 + _ 1-_2 2 d ( ^2+^2-f^2 ) + + & & _ 1 2 _",

    "0^l r drd ( z^2 + ^2 r^2 )  , [ s1 ] with @xmath38 parametrizing small deviations of the string in the transverse direction .",
    "one can readily see that in the quadratic part of the action ( [ s12 ] ) the ` longitudinal ' variation of the bounce boundary in the @xmath28 plane , described by the function @xmath39 completely decouples from the rest of the variables .",
    "this implies that the path integral over @xmath34 can be considered independently of the integration over other variables and that it enters as a factor in @xmath40 . on the other hand",
    "it is this integral that provides the imaginary part to the partition function , and it is also proportional to the total space - time area @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , this path integral is identical to the one entering the problem of false vacuum decay in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions and we can directly apply the result of that calculation@xcite : f = _ 1-_2 2  .",

    "there still is a coupling in the path integral ( [ tz12 ] ) between the bulk variables @xmath42 , @xmath43 and the boundary variable @xmath35 arising from the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) .",
    "this however is a simple issue which is resolved by a straightforward shift of the integration variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "namely , we write z_1(r , ) = z_1c(r , ) + z_1q(r , )  ,  z_2(r , ) = z_2c(r , ) + z_2q(r , )  , [ zcq ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the new integration variables in @xmath49 and these functions satisfy zero boundary conditions , z_1q(r , ) = z_2q(r , ) = z_1q(l , ) = z_2q(l , ) = 0  , [ zqbc ] while @xmath50 and @xmath51 are fixed ( for a fixed @xmath52 ) functions satisfying the boundary conditions z_1c(r , ) = z_2c(r , ) =( )  , z_1c(l , ) = 0  , [ zcbc ] which are also harmonic , i.e. satisfying the laplace equation @xmath53 .    after the specified shift of the variables we arrive at the expression for the action ( [ ts12 ] ) in which the bulk and the boundary degrees of freedom are fully separated : _ 12 & = & _ 1-_2 2 d ^2 + r d ( _ 2 2 _",
    "r z_2c .    & - & _ 1 2 d^2r z_1q z_1q - _ 2 2 d^2r z_2q z_2q  .",
    "[ tss ] clearly , the boundary terms in the first line here , arising from the integration by parts , depend only on the transverse shift of the boundary @xmath52 .",
    "the partition function @xmath41 can thus be written as a product of the ` boundary ' and the ` bulk ' terms : _ 12 = z_12 ( boundary ) z_12 ( bulk )  , [ z12bb ] with the @xmath54 being given by the path integral over the bulk variables @xmath47 and @xmath48 only : _ 12 ( bulk)= z_1q d z_q ( _ 1 2 d^2r z_1q z_1q + _ 2 2 d^2r z_2q z_2q )  , [ z12bk ] and the boundary term _ 12 ( boundary)= [ z12by ] involving integration over only the boundary values .    the subsequent calculation of the ratio of the partition functions in eq.([g2 ] ) can in fact be reduced to a calculation of @xmath55 only . in order to achieve this reduction one should organize the partition function @xmath26 in the denominator of eq.([g2 ] ) in a form similar to eq.([z12bb ] ) as follows .",
    "although the flat string configuration makes no reference to a circle of the radius @xmath56 , the partition function @xmath26 can be calculated by first fixing the transverse variable @xmath31 at @xmath57 : @xmath58 and separating the integration over the bulk variables .",
    "then the flat string partition function factorizes in the form similar to eq.([z12bb ] ) : _ 1 = z_1 ( boundary ) z_1 ( bulk )  , [ z1bb ] with @xmath59 given a similar path integral as in eq.([z12bk ] ) , _ 1 ( bulk)= z_1q d z_q ( _ 1 2 d^2r z_1q z_1q + _ 1 2 d^2r z_2q z_2q )  , [ z1bk ] where , as in eq.([z12bk ] ) , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are respectively the outer ( i.e. at @xmath60 ) and the inner ( @xmath61 ) transverse fluctuations with zero boundary conditions .",
    "the difference in the coefficient in the expressions ( [ z12bk ] ) and ( [ z1bk ] ) for the contribution of the inner part , @xmath1 vs. @xmath0 , is not essential , since the overall coefficient of the quadratic part of the action is absorbed in the measure of integration , as can be seen by rescaling to the corresponding canonically normalized variables @xmath62 .",
    "one therefore finds that @xmath63 , and the ratio of the partition functions in eq.([g2 ] ) is in fact determined by the ratio of the boundary terms .",
    "the boundary factor @xmath64 for the flat string is somewhat different from the one given by eq.([z12by ] ) and reads as _ 1 ( boundary)=  , [ z1by ] where the functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 are defined in the same way as in eq.([z12by ] ) .",
    "the latter functions can be readily found by expanding the boundary function @xmath52 in angular harmonics : ( ) = a_0 + 1 _ n=1^[ft ] with @xmath65 and @xmath66 being the amplitudes of the harmonics . then at @xmath67 the harmonics of the discussed functions are found as z_1c^(n)(r , ) = 1 r^n r^n ,  z_2c^(n)(r , ) = 1 r^n r^n  , [ hn ] and for n=0 these are given by z_1c^(0)(r , ) = a_0 ( r / l ) ( r / l )  ,   z_2c^(0)(r , ) = a_0  .",
    "[ h0 ] substituting these expressions for the harmonics in the equations ( [ z12by ] ) and ( [ z1by ] ) and performing the gaussian integration over the amplitudes @xmath65 and @xmath66 we find the boundary factors in the form _ 12 ( boundary)=n _ n=1^   [ z12by1 ] and _ 1 ( boundary)=n _ n=1^ [ z1by1 ] with @xmath68 being a normalization factor .    clearly , each of the formal expressions ( [ z12by1 ] ) and ( [ z1by1 ] ) contains a divergent product , and their ratio is also ill defined , so that our calculation requires a regularization procedure that would cut off the contribution of harmonics with large @xmath69 .",
    "a regularization of high harmonics is also required on general grounds . indeed , as previously mentioned , our consideration using the effective string action ( [ a0 ] ) is only valid for smooth deformations of the string , i.e. as long as the relevant momenta are smaller than the mass scale @xmath17 for excitation of the internal degrees of freedom within the thickness of the string . for an @xmath69-th",
    "harmonic the relevant momentum is @xmath70 so that the applicability of the effective low energy action requires a cutoff at @xmath71 .",
    "in order to perform such regularization we use the standard pauli - villars method and introduce a regulator field @xmath72 with negative norm and the action corresponding to the quadratic part of the nambu - goto expression ( [ a0 ] ) for small @xmath31 : s_r= d^2 + _ 1 2 _ a_1 d^2r + _ 2 2 _ a_2 d^2r [ sr ] with @xmath73 being the regulator mass , which physically should be understood as satisfying the condition @xmath74 and still being much larger than the relevant scale in the discussed problem , in particular @xmath75 .",
    "the regularized expression for the ratio of the boundary terms in @xmath40 and @xmath76 thus takes the form = ^-1  , [ reg ] where we introduced the notation @xmath77 for the regularized ratio , and the regulator partition functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 are determined by the same expressions as in eqs.([z12by ] ) and ( [ z1by ] ) with the ` outer ' and ` inner ' functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 being replaced by their regulator counterparts @xmath80 and @xmath81 which still satisfy the boundary conditions similar to ( [ zcbc ] ) : z_1c ( r , ) = z_2c(r , ) = _ r ( )  , [ zrbc ] but are the solutions of the helmholtz rather than laplace equation @xmath82 .",
    "the solutions of the latter equation fall off exponentially at the scale determined by @xmath73 , and for our purposes only the behavior near the circle @xmath57 is needed .",
    "for this reason we write the equation for the radial part of the @xmath69-th angular harmonic @xmath83 , z_n+1 r z_n -n^2 r^2 z_n - m^2 z_n = 0  , [ zneq ] and parametrize the radial coordinate as @xmath84 , and treat the parameter @xmath85 as small , since the scale for the variation of the solution is @xmath86 .",
    "this approach yields an expansion of the regulator action associated with the boundary at @xmath57 in powers of @xmath87 . with the accuracy required in the present calculation , the ( normalized to one at @xmath57 ) solution to eq.([zneq ] )",
    "is found in the first order of expansion in @xmath85 as z_n(r+x)= ( 1- 1 2 ( m r)^2 ( mr)^2+n^2 x r ) ( - |x| r )  .",
    "[ znsol ]    using the form of the solutions for the harmonics of the regulator field given by eq.([znsol ] ) and the expressions ( [ z12by1 ] ) and ( [ z1by1 ] ) , one can write the regularized ratio of the boundary partition functions ( [ reg ] ) as & = & + & & _ n=1^\\ { 1 + 1 2 ( mr)^2 }  , [ crprod ] where we introduced the notation b=_1+_2 _ 1-_2  , [ bdef ] and the last product factor in eq.([crprod ] ) arises from the first term of expansion in @xmath85 in the pre - exponential factor in eq.([znsol ] )",

    "the entire pre - exponential factor can then be found using the effective low energy action for these modes@xcite . in the considered here string transition",
    "there are also low modes in the bulk of the world sheet of the string , and there is no parametric separation of their eigenvalues from those of the modes associated with fluctuations of the boundary . in the presented calculation",
    "the separation of the boundary and bulk variables is achieved through an ` artificial ' organization of the normalization partition function for a flat string into boundary and bulk factors @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the bulk contribution then cancels in the ratio of the partition functions near the bounce and near a flat string , so that the remaining calculation is reduced to considering the integrals over the boundary functions only .",
    "one can also readily notice that the additional contribution to the action from the boundary terms as e.g. those with the functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 in eq.([z12by ] ) corresponds to precisely the effect of ` dragging ' of the string by its end .",
