    "quantum entanglement@xcite is the most important notion in quantum mechanics and quantum information theory .",
    "research into quantum entanglement was initiated from the very beginning of quantum mechanics@xcite . at that time",
    "the main motivation for the study was pure theoretical in the context of the nonlocal properties of quantum mechanics .",
    "however , recent considerable attention to it is mainly due to its crucial role as a physical resource in various quantum information processing .",
    "in fact , quantum entanglement plays a central role in quantum teleportation@xcite , superdense coding@xcite , quantum cloning@xcite , and quantum cryptography@xcite .",
    "it is also quantum entanglement , which makes the quantum computer outperform the classical one@xcite .",
    "thus , it is essential to understand how to quantify and how to characterize the multipartite entanglement .",
    "still , however , this issue is not completely understood .",
    "the most direct classification of the multipartite entanglement is to use the local unitary ( lu ) , i.e. , the unitary operations acted independently on each of the subsystems .",
    "since quantum entanglement is a nonlocal property of a given multipartite state , it should be invariant under the lu transformations .",
    "the lu transformation is related to local operations and classical communication ( locc ) @xcite as follows .",
    "let two quantum states , say @xmath4 and @xmath5 , be in the same category of lu .",
    "then , one state can be converted into the other one with certainty by means of locc .",
    "although the lu is a useful tool for the classification of the multipartite entanglement , it generates infinite equivalent classes even in the simplest bipartite systems .    in order to escape this difficulty the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite suggested the classification through stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) .",
    "if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are in the same slocc class , this means that one state can be converted into the other state with nonzero probability by means of locc .",
    "mathematically , if two @xmath6-party states @xmath4 and @xmath5 are in the same slocc class , they are related to each other by @xmath7 with @xmath8 being arbitrary invertible local operators .",
    "however , it is more useful to restrict ourselves to the slocc transformation where all @xmath8 belong to sl(@xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , the group of @xmath11 complex matrices having determinant equal to @xmath12 .",
    "the slocc classification was first examined in the three - qubit pure - state system@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the whole system consists of six inequivalent slocc classes , i.e. , fully separable ( s ) , three bi - separable ( b ) , w , and greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) classes .",
    "moreover , it is possible to know which class an arbitrary state @xmath4 belongs by computing the residual entanglement @xmath13@xcite and concurrences @xmath14@xcite for its partially reduced states .",
    "similarly , the entanglement of whole three - qubit mixed states also consists of s , b , w , and ghz types@xcite .",
    "it was shown that these classes satisfy a linear hierarchy s @xmath15 b @xmath15 w @xmath15 ghz .",
    "although slocc classes for the three - qubit system are well - known , still it is highly difficult problem to know which type of entanglement is contained for arbitrary three - qubit mixed states .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the analytic computation of the residual entanglement for arbitrary mixed state is generally impossible except few rare case@xcite .",
    "recently , a significant progress has been made in this issue in ref .",
    "authors in ref .",
    "@xcite examined the whole set of the three - qubit ghz - symmetric states .",
    "this is an invariant symmetry under ( i ) qubit permutations , ( ii ) simultaneous flips , ( iii ) qubit rotations about the @xmath16-axis .",
    "it was shown that the whole ghz - symmetric states can be parametrized by two real parameters , _ say _ @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the whole ghz - symmetric states are represented as points inside a triangle of fig . 1 in @xmath19 plane .",
    "authors in ref .",
    "@xcite succeeded in classifying the entanglement of the three - qubit ghz - symmetric states completely .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the linear hierarchy s @xmath15 b @xmath15 w @xmath15 ghz holds in this subset states . this complete classification makes it possible to compute the three - tangle , square root of the residual entanglement , analytically for the whole ghz - symmetric states@xcite and to construct the class - specific optimal witnesses@xcite .",
    "it also makes it possible to obtain lower bound of three - tangle for arbitrary three - qubit mixed state@xcite .",
    "more recently , the slocc classification of the extended ghz - symmetric states was discussed@xcite",
    ". extended ghz symmetry is the ghz symmetry without qubit permutation symmetry .",
    "thus , it is larger symmetry group than usual ghz symmetry group , and is parametrized by four real parameters .",

    "the slocc classification of the four - qubit system was explored in ref .",
    "@xcite . unlike , however , three - qubit case their results seem to be contradictory to each other .",
    "in particular , the number of the slocc classes is different as table i shows .",
    "furthermore , we do not know any linear hierarchy in the four - qubit system .",
    "thus , our understanding on the four - qubit entanglement is still incomplete .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite to four - qubit system . for this purpose",
    "we choose nine slocc classes of four - qubit system suggested in ref .",
    "this classification is achieved by making use of the jordan block structure of some complex symmetric matrix .",
    "nine classes and their representative states are @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are complex parameters with nonnegative real part .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
