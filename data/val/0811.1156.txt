    "a kicked system is a hamiltonian system that is periodically driven by pulses of infinitesimal duration .",
    "more than thirty years after the invention of the paradigmatic model of such systems , namely the kicked rotor ( kr ) @xcite , kicked quantum dynamics is still the focus of active research for a twofold reason . on the one hand , it has given birth to an ever increasing list of variants of the basic original prototypes , which have provided formally simple models for the investigation of quantum - classical correspondence and of some general properties of quantum transport .",
    "these include dynamical localization @xcite , anomalous diffusion @xcite , decay from stable phase - space islands @xcite , electronic conduction in mesoscopic devices @xcite , nondispersive wave packet dynamics @xcite , effects of dissipation on quantum dynamics @xcite , and lately directed transport @xcite . on the other hand , renewed interest on the physical side has been stimulated by experimental realizations @xcite , which are now possible , under excellent control conditions , thanks to the science and technology of cold and ultra - cold atoms .",
    "unexpected advances of the theory have been prompted by such experiments .",
    "for instance , the so - called quantum accelerator modes ( qam ) were discovered in experiments with cold atoms in periodically pulsed optical lattices @xcite .",
    "their underlying theoretical model is a variant of the kicked rotor model , the difference being that , in between kicks , atoms are subject to gravity .",
    "when the kicking period is close to a half - integer multiple of the talbot time @xcite , which is a natural time scale for the system , a fraction of atoms steadily accelerates away from the bulk of the atomic cloud , at a rate and in a direction which depend on various parameter values .",
    "though qams are a somewhat particular phenomenon , their theory @xcite is a vast repertory of classic items of classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "qams are rooted in subtle aspects of the bloch theory , and have a relation to the wannier - stark resonances of solid - state physics @xcite .",
    "they are a purely quantal effect , and yet they are explained in terms of trajectories of certain classical dynamical systems , by means of a ",
    "pseudo - quasi classical \" approximation , where the role of the planck constant is played by a parameter @xmath2 , which measures the detuning of the kicking period from a half - integer multiple of the talbot time .",
    "this theory hinges on existence of a  pseudoclassical limit \" for @xmath3 .",
    "that means , for kicking periods close to half - integer multiples of the talbot time , the quantum dynamics may formally be obtained from quantization of a classical dynamical system , using @xmath2 as the planck constant .",
    "this system is totally unrelated from the classical system that is obtained in the proper classical limit @xmath4 .",
    "+ experimental and theoretical investigation on qams are currently focused on novel research lines : the observation of qams in a bose - einstein condensate @xcite , which allows a precise control on the initial momentum distribution , the analysis of qams for special values of the physical parameters @xcite and , in particular , when the kicking period is close to a rational multiple of talbot time @xcite .",
    "theoretical aspects concerning the latter problem are considered in the present paper .",
    "+        qams are connected with an important feature of the kr model , namely , the kr resonances @xcite , which occur whenever the kicking period is rationally related to the internal frequencies of the free rotor .",
    "the dynamics of the rotor at a quantum resonance is invariant under momentum translations by multiples of an integer number .",
    "the least positive integer @xmath1 , such that translation invariance in momentum space holds , is the  order \" of the resonance ( sect . [ back ] ) .",
    "the half - talbot time in atom - optics experiments is the period of the kr resonances of order @xmath5 ( i.e.  principal \" resonances ) , so the originally observed qams are related to kr resonances of order @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    "we consider quantum motion in the vicinity of a higher order kr resonance ( @xmath7 ) in the presence of gravity .",
    "numerical ( see fig.[pac - tot ] ) and heuristic indications @xcite suggest that higher - order kr resonances , too , may give rise to qams . this has been substantiated by a theory @xcite based on a nontrivial reformulation of the original pseudo - classical approximation .",
    "it has been remarked that , in the case of higher - order resonances , no pseudoclassical limit exists and similarity to the case of quasi - classical analysis for particles with spin was noted , but not explored . about the latter general problem @xcite , it is known that",
    ", although no single well - defined classical limit exists , and so no global quasi - classical phase - space approximation in terms of a unique classical hamiltonian flow is possible , _ local _ quasi - classical approximations are nevertheless still possible , as provided by bundles of trajectories which belong to a number of different hamiltonian systems .    in this paper",
    "we develop a formulation of the problem of qams near higher - order resonances in spinor terms .",
    "the quantum evolution at exact resonance is described by a multi - component wave function , that is by a spinor of rank @xmath1 , given by the order of the resonance @xcite , and is generated by a time - independent spinor hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we show that the small-@xmath2 analysis of quantum dynamics is formally equivalent to semiclassical approximation for a particle with spin - orbit coupling .",
    "thus qams near higher order resonances constitute a particular , though experimentally relevant , model system , in which this crucial theoretical issue can be explored . the semiclassical theory in @xcite",
    "is not directly applicable here , because the dynamics is not specified by a self adjoint spinor hamiltonian , but by a spinor unitary propagator instead .",
    "we therefore resort to an ",
    "adiabatic \" ansatz , which allows decoupling spin dynamics from orbital motion . in this way",
    "we obtain @xmath1 distinct and independent orbital one - period propagators .",
    "each of them may be viewed as the quantization of a formally classical dynamical system , given by a map ; however , the  pseudo - planck constant \" @xmath2 explicitly appears in such maps , in a form that precludes existence of a @xmath3 limit for the maps themselves , except for the @xmath5 case , in which the pseudo - classical theory of ref .",
    "@xcite is recovered .",
    "+ qams , detected by numerical simulations of the exact quantum dynamics near higher order resonances , tightly correspond to stable periodic orbits of the maps .",
    "the acceleration of the modes is expressed in terms of the winding numbers of the corresponding orbits and of the order of the resonance .",
    "moreover , we derive some theoretical results , which generalize those obtained in @xcite for the principal resonances : a formula for the special values of quasi - momenta , which dominate the mode , and a classification of detectable modes by a farey tree contruction @xcite , as a function of the gravity acceleration .    the paper is organized as follows . in sect.[back ] the floquet operator , describing one - step evolution of a kicked atom in a free - falling frame , is recalled and the resonant spinor dynamics in kicked particle ( kp ) model is briefly reviewed ; in sect.[sodec ] , the quantum motion in the vicinity of a resonance of arbitrary order is related to the problem of a particle with spin - orbit coupling . in sect.[map ] , a  formally \" classical description of the orbital dynamics , associated to the qams , is achieved .",
    "finally , in sect.[exper ] connections between the theoretical results and possible experimental findings are discussed .",
    "in the laboratory frame , the quantum dynamics of the atoms moving under the joint action of gravity and of the kicking potential , is ruled by the time - dependent hamiltonian ( expressed in dimensionless units ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the momentum and position operators . the potential @xmath11 is a smooth periodic function of spatial period @xmath12 . denoting @xmath13 and @xmath14 the atomic mass , the temporal period of the kicking , the kicking strength , the gravity acceleration and the spatial period of the kicks , respectively , the momentum , position and mass of the atom in ( [ ham - l ] ) are rescaled in units of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    ", the hamiltonian ( [ ham - l ] ) reduces to that of the kicked particle model ( kp ) , which is a well - known variant of the kicked rotor model ( kr ) , corresponding to the particular choice : @xmath27 .",
    "the kp differs from the kr because the eigenvalues of particle momentum are continuos while those of the angular momentum of the rotor are discrete .",
    "due to bloch theorem , the invariance of the kp hamiltonian , under space translations by @xmath12 , implies conservation of the quasi - momentum @xmath28 , which , in the chosen units , is the fractional part of the momentum .",
    "the particle momentum is decomposed as @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "conservation of quasi - momentum enables a bloch - wannier fibration of the particle dynamics : the particle wave function is obtained by a superposition of bloch waves , describing the states of independently evolving kicked rotors with different values of the quasi - momentum ( called @xmath28-rotors ) .",
    "a remarkable feature of hamiltonian ( [ ham - l ] ) is that , unless rescaled gravity @xmath32 assumes exceptional commensurate values , the linear potential term breaks invariance under @xmath33 space translations .",
    "such an invariance may be recovered by going to a temporal gauge , where momentum is measured _ w.r.t .",
    "_ free fall .",
    "this transformation gets rid of the linear term and the new hamiltonian reads @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the quantum motion of a @xmath28-rotor in the  temporal gauge \" ( that is ,  in the falling frame \" ) is described by the following floquet operator on @xmath37 ( @xmath38 denotes the 1-torus , parametrized by @xmath39 ) : @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the number of kicks .",
