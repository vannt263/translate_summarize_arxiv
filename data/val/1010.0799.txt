    "neutrino physics has been at the forefront of particle phenomenology in the last years . after the discovery of neutrino oscillations , experiments have entered the precision era @xcite , measuring the relevant parameters with increasing accuracy @xcite and highlighting the need for an explanation of neutrino masses .",
    "the seesaw mechanism is the most popular framework to accommodate neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "the existence of very heavy fields , right - handed neutrinos in the most common variation , naturally explains the smallness of neutrino masses due to the famous seesaw relation , @xmath0 .",
    "however , the structure of the seesaw makes direct tests impossible .",
    "the new heavy fields can not be produced at colliders and therefore at best only indirect tests will be possible .",
    "in addition to the question of neutrino masses , the standard model has other theoretical problems that need to be addressed .",
    "several extensions have been built with this purpose , filling the literature with a wide variety of ideas that will be put to experimental test in the coming years . among the different choices , supersymmetry ( susy )",
    "is the most popular one because it technically solves the hierarchy problem @xcite and it has the capability to address many of the other open questions , like the nature of dark matter , gauge coupling unification and radiative symmetry breaking , to mention a few .",
    "one of the key points in supersymmetric model building is r - parity violation / conservation @xcite .",
    "this discrete symmetry , defined as @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 and @xmath3 stand for baryon and lepton numbers and @xmath4 for the spin of the particle ) , is usually imposed to forbid the dangerous baryon and lepton number violating interactions , never seen in nature .",
    "if both were simultaneously present , proton decay would be extremely fast , a phenomenological disaster that is prevented by forbidding the r - parity violating ( ) couplings .",
    "one of the consequences of this new symmetry is the existence of a stable particle , a natural dark matter candidate , and thus its practical importance is beyond any doubt .",
    "however , its fundamental origin is totally unknown and in most cases it is introduced by hand in the theory . compared to the standard model , where baryon and lepton numbers are automatically conserved , this is a step back .    a possible approach to understand the origin of r - parity is to embed the mssm in an extended model with a gauge group containing a @xmath5 piece .",
    "the original high - energy theory will conserve r - parity due to the gauge symmetry and r - parity will become a remnant subgroup at low energies if the scalar fields responsible for the breaking have even @xmath6 charges .",
    "this picture can be realized in minimal @xmath5 extensions of the mssm , see for example @xcite , or , more ambitiously , in left - right ( lr ) symmetric models @xcite .",
    "apart from the conservation of r - parity this type of models have other motivations .",
    "the original motivation was the restoration of parity as an exact symmetry at higher energies @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that they provide technical solutions to the susy cp and strong cp problems @xcite , they give an understanding of the @xmath7 charges and they can be embedded in @xmath8 grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "here we study some phenomenological aspects of a supersymmetric lr model that leads to r - parity conservation at low energies and incorporates a type - i seesaw mechanism to generate neutrino masses .",
    "we will concentrate the discussion on lepton flavor violating signals in slepton decays , such as @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "these signatures have been known to be important in susy models for many years @xcite , and in fact they have been already studied in great detail for minimal seesaw implementations , see for example @xcite .",
    "this work , however , studies the case of a non - minimal seesaw , what implies new features . in particular , the high - energy restoration of parity enhances the flavor violating effects in the right - handed slepton sector , contrary to the usual expectation .",
    "this way , by measuring braching ratios of lfv decays at colliders one can get valuable information on the structure of the high - energy theory .",
    "there are many supersymmetric lr models in the literature . from the pioneering works in the 70s ,",
    "many extensions and variations have been proposed . in all of them",
    "the left - right gauge group @xmath11 breaks down to the sm gauge group @xmath12 .",
    "however , one can choose different representations in the scalar sector , responsible for the breaking of the symmetry , and obtain very different low energy effective theories .",
    "in addition , there are several ingredients that can not be forgotten if one wants to have a consistent framework .",
    "therefore , four requirements will be imposed as guidelines for the choice of the model : ( a ) automatic conservation of r - parity , ( b ) parity conservation at high energies , ( c ) seesaw mechanism , and ( d ) cancellation of anomalies .",
    "the first lr models used @xmath13 doublets to break the gauge symmetry . the non - supersymmetric model proposed in references @xcite introduced two additional scalar doublets @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 under @xmath11 and @xmath13 charged fields , and anomaly cancellation , that implies that for every group representation with charge @xmath18 under @xmath5 there must be another one with charge @xmath19 .",
    "this will be also found in the models discussed below . ] .",
    "when the neutral component of @xmath15 gets a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath20 , the gauge symmetry is broken down to the sm gauge group and the known low energy phenomenology with broken parity is recovered .",
    "however , such models are not suited for the purpose of this study .",
    "the reason comes from the oddness of @xmath15 under @xmath5 . in a supersymmetric version of the model",
    ", the breaking of the gauge symmetry by @xmath21 also implies the breaking of r - parity .",
    "this could be solved by imposing additional discrete symmetries to the model that forbid the dangerous operators @xcite , but this can not be regarded as automatic r - parity conservation .",
    "in addition , there is no seesaw mechanism to generate neutrino masses , and additional superfields would be needed to account for them .",
    "the simplest solution is to break the gauge symmetry by @xmath13 fields with even charge under @xmath5 .",
    "this was in fact proposed in reference @xcite , where four triplets were added to the mssm spectrum : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in these models , sometimes called msusylr ( minimal supersymmetric left - right ) , @xmath26 is broken down to @xmath27 by the vevs of the scalar components of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "when this occurs , a right - handed neutrino mass is generated from the operator @xmath30 , leading to a type - i seesaw mechanism .",
    "however , the issue of r - parity conservation is not clear .",
    "although one would naively expect that r - parity is automatically conserved due to the even @xmath6 charges of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the scalar potential of the theory might not allow to have vanishing sneutrino vevs @xcite , favoring the existence of r - parity breaking minima .",
    "for many years , msusylr and its minimal extensions were considered to break r - parity .",
    "nevertheless , the authors of the recent reference @xcite claimed that 1-loop corrections change the picture , allowing for vanishing sneutrino vevs in the minimum of the potential .",
    "since this is still a controversial issue that relies on not fully calculated loop corrections , we leave this possibility for future studies .",
    "finally , aulakh and collaborators @xcite extended msusylr by the addition of two triplets , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "they showed that the scalar potential offers the new possibility , within large regions of parameter space , of having minima that conserve r - parity while breaking the gauge symmetry in the proper way .",
    "moreover , since the @xmath33 triplets are part of the spectrum , the seesaw mechanism is present like in msusylr , generating small masses for the light neutrinos . in conclusion",
    ", this model fulfills the requirements that we imposed , and thus we will concentrate on it in the following .",
    "the matter content of the model is @xcite    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath3 and @xmath36 contain the quark and lepton superfields of the mssm with the addition of a right - handed neutrino @xmath37 .",
    "the two @xmath38 superfields are @xmath39 bidoublets and contain the usual @xmath40 and @xmath41 mssm higgs doublets .",
    "finally , the rest of the superfields are introduced to break the lr symmetry . with these representations ,",
    "the most general superpotential compatible with the gauge symmetry and parity is    @xmath42    family and gauge indices have been omitted in equation .",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 are the usual quark and lepton yukawa couplings",
    ". however , note that @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , and thus there are four @xmath48 yukawa matrices .",
    "conservation of parity implies that they must be symmetric .",
    "@xmath49 is a @xmath48 complex symmetric matrix , whereas @xmath50 is a @xmath51 antisymmetric matrix , and thus it only contains one complex parameter , @xmath52 .",
    "the breaking of the lr gauge group to the mssm gauge group happens in two steps .",
    "@xmath53    the first step is due to the vev of the @xmath54 field @xmath55 , which breaks @xmath13 .",
    "however , note that , since @xmath56 there is a @xmath57 symmetry left over .",
    "next , the group @xmath58 is broken by @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the remaining symmetry is @xmath27 , with hypercharge defined as @xmath61 .",
    "note that , since the tadpole equations do not link @xmath62 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 with their left - handed counterparts , the left - handed triplets can be taken to have vanishing vevs @xcite .",
    "although a hierarchy between the two breaking scales may exist , @xmath63 , one can not neglect the effects of the second breaking stage on the first one .",
    "the tadpole equations mix them , and only through the contribution of the @xmath64 fields one can understand a non - vanishing @xmath65 vev . in fact , there is an inverse hierarchy between the vevs and the superpotential masses @xmath66 , @xmath67 , given by    @xmath68    and so , for @xmath63 one needs @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "lepton flavor violation is a well known indirect test of the seesaw mechanism @xcite . assuming flavor - blind soft susy breaking terms at some high - energy scale , the rge running down to the susy scale generates non - zero off - diagonal entries in the slepton soft squared masses .",
    "these flavor violating entries are connected to the effective neutrino mass matrix and thus , by making some assumptions , one can find testable relations .",
    "moreover , they induce lfv decays , such as @xmath70 and @xmath9 with @xmath10 . by studying",
    "these decays one can set important constraints and get valuable information on the underlying theory .",
    "in all cases studied in the literature , based on minimal seesaw models , the off - diagonal entries of the soft masses of right - handed sleptons get negligible contributions from the rge running and thus one expects no visible signal of lfv from the right - handed sector at the lhc",
    ". however , in lr models the gauge symmetry makes left- and right - handed sectors behave the same , and then the lfv violating entries of the soft squared masses in the right - handed sector must contain non - negligible contributions .",
    "this novel lhc signal would point to a high - energy lr symmetry in a very clean way .",
    "that is the main result of this work . as we will show below , lfv in the right - handed lepton / slepton sector",
    "can be observable in this model . in order to prove it we perform a numerical calculation using the code spheno @xcite , including 2-loop rges and the corresponding 1-loop threshold corrections at the intermediate scales .",
    "the yukawa parameters @xmath44 are fixed in order to correctly reproduce neutrino oscillation data .",
    "finally , all analytical computations have been done with the help of the mathematica package sarah @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fvvsseesaw ] shows @xmath71 and @xmath72 as a function of the seesaw scale , defined as @xmath73 .",
    "the dependence on the seesaw scale is clearly understood from the seesaw formula .",
    "this implies that larger @xmath74 requires larger yukawa parameters in order to fit neutrino masses which , in turn , leads to larger flavor violating terms due to rge running .     and @xmath72 as a function of the seesaw scale , defined as @xmath73 , for the parameter choice @xmath75 gev and @xmath76 gev .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to @xmath77 , whereas the solid ones correspond to @xmath78 .",
    "the msugra parameters have been taken as in the sps3 benchmark point @xcite and the right - handed neutrino spectrum has been assumed to be degenerate , @xmath79.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    furthermore , figure [ fig : fvvsseesaw ] also shows that right - handed staus can also have lfv decays with observable rates .",
    "this is the main novelty in this model .",
    "one can see that for large @xmath74 values , around @xmath80 gev , the rates for lfv are measurable for both left- and right - handed staus .",
    "see references @xcite for the lhc discovery potential in the search for lfv .",
    "the previous result can be understood by using analytical approximations for the slepton soft squared masses .",
    "the running from the gut scale to the susy scale generates off - diagonal entries @xmath81 in both left- and right - handed slepton soft masses . in the first step , from the gut scale to the @xmath65 scale",
    "they can be written in leading - log approximation as @xcite    @xmath82    after parity breaking at @xmath65 the yukawa coupling @xmath44 splits into @xmath83 , the charged lepton yukawa , and @xmath84 , the neutrino yukawa .",
    "the later contributes to lfv entries in the running down to the @xmath85 scale    @xmath86    finally , from @xmath85 to the susy scale one recovers the mssm rges , which do not add any flavor violating effect .",
    "this short discussion shows an important consequence of the symmetry breaking pattern . from the gut scale to the @xmath65 scale parity is conserved and the magnitude of the lfv entries in the left- and right - handed sectors is the same , see eqs . and",
    "however , from @xmath65 to @xmath85 only the left - handed ones keep running , and thus one expects larger flavor violation in this sector .",
    "moreover , if the difference between @xmath65 and @xmath85 is increased , the difference between the lfv entries in the l and r sectors gets increased as well .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : diflr ] , which shows branching ratios for the lfv decays of the staus as a function of @xmath85 for a fixed value of @xmath87 gev .",
    "the theoretical expectation is obtained : the difference between @xmath88 and @xmath89 strongly depends on the difference between @xmath65 and @xmath85 .     and @xmath72 as a function of @xmath85 , for a fixed @xmath87 gev .",
    "to the left , @xmath90 gev , whereas to the right @xmath91 gev .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to @xmath77 , whereas the solid ones correspond to @xmath78 .",
    "the msugra parameters have been taken as in the sps3 benchmark point @xcite and the right - handed neutrino spectrum has been assumed to be degenerate , @xmath79.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    and @xmath72 as a function of @xmath85 , for a fixed @xmath87 gev . to the left , @xmath90 gev , whereas to the right @xmath91 gev .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to @xmath77 , whereas the solid ones correspond to @xmath78 .",
    "the msugra parameters have been taken as in the sps3 benchmark point @xcite and the right - handed neutrino spectrum has been assumed to be degenerate , @xmath79.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the question arises whether one can determine the ratio @xmath92 by measuring both @xmath88 and @xmath89 at the lhc .",
    "this is answered in figure [ fig : complr ] where the ratio @xmath93 is plotted as a function of @xmath94 .",
    "a measurement of both branching ratios would allow to constrain the ratio @xmath94 .",
    "however , there is a slight dependence on other important quantities , such as @xmath95 and @xmath74 .",
    "this implies that more experimental information will be needed in order to set reliable constraints .     as a function of @xmath94 .",
    "the seesaw scale @xmath74 takes values in the range @xmath96 $ ] gev .",
    "the rest of the parameters have been chosen as in figure [ fig : diflr].,scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "neutrino masses and r - parity conservation are two issues not addressed in the mssm . on the one hand",
    ", the mssm does not provide an explanation for the observation of neutrino oscillations and the subsequent non - zero neutrino masses .",
    "these experimental results require the introduction of a mechanism that can explain the smallness of the neutrino masses , being the seesaw mechanism the most popular choice . on the other hand , r - parity",
    "is introduced in the mssm as an ad - hoc symmetry , without any theoretical motivation .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study extended symmetry groups that can lead to r - parity conservation at low energies .    in this work",
    "we have studied some phenomenological aspects of a supersymmetric left - right model which automatically conserves r - parity and contains the seesaw mechanism to generate neutrino masses .",
    "we have found that , contrary to minimal realizations of the seesaw , large lepton flavor violating effects are obtained both in the left- and right - handed slepton sectors .",
    "this is a useful signature that allows us to get additional information on the high energy regime and clearly points to an underlying left - right symmetry .",
    "in particular , we have shown that observables like @xmath97 can get strong deviations from the standard seesaw picture , allowing us to constrain the parameters of the high energy theory and get a hint on its structure . furthermore , there are other observables which are also very sensitive to new right - handed flavor violation .",
    "examples are slepton mass splittings and the polarization of the outgoing electrons in @xmath98 .",
    "we plan to address these issues in a future publication @xcite .",
