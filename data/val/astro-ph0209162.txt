    "during the early phase of the cosmological evolution the universe could experience a period of accelerated expansion known as inflation .",
    "the simplest scenario with a time dependent equation of state yielding the required negative pressure is that of a single real scalar field , _ the inflaton _ , with dynamics dominated by its potential energy . for extensive details and references on this scenario and on the other topics mentioned in this introduction",
    "see book @xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the inflaton quantum fluctuations would be stretched by the expansion beyond the radius within which causal interactions take place .",
    "these curvature perturbations could reenter the causal horizon in much later epochs and , through gravitational collapse , lead to anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature and to cosmological large scale structure ( lss ) . during inflation",
    "primordial gravitational waves are also produced .",
    "these tensor perturbations induce a curled polarization in the cmb radiation and increase the overall amplitude of its anisotropies at large angular scales .",
    "a hint about the physics in the very early universe could be obtained by fitting to data the result of analytical calculations of the cmb and density spectra .",
    "these calculations depend on the values of some parameters which are the ones to be pinned down .",
    "the initial conditions for the evolution of the thermal anisotropies are also characterized by several quantities .",
    "these primordial parameters are often given as the multipoles of @xmath1 where @xmath2 stands for the normalized amplitudes of the scalar ( @xmath3 ) or tensor ( @xmath4 ) perturbations , the corresponding spectral indices , @xmath5 , are defined by , @xmath6 @xmath7 is the comoving wavenumber corresponding to the wavelength matching the hubble horizon during inflation and @xmath8 is a pivot scale .",
    "initially , only @xmath9 was fitted . since inflation predicts nearly scale  invariant spectra , the tilt given by the scalar spectral index",
    "was then taken into account .",
    "this reduces the primordial spectrum to a power ",
    "law function of the scale @xmath10 .",
    "the only single field model exactly yielding such a spectrum is power ",
    "law inflation @xcite where the cosmic scale factor , @xmath11 , behaves like a power  law of the cosmic time , @xmath12 , and the inflaton potential is an exponential function .",
    "signals of nonzero ` running ' of the scalar index , @xmath13 , have already been reported @xcite and must be refined by near future observations , allowing , this way , to move beyond the power  law approximation .",
    "the role of the tensor perturbations deserves also attention when determining the best  fit values of the cosmological parameters from cmb and lss spectra .",
    "that is motivated in part by the possibility of measuring the cosmic background polarization , allowing the tensorial contribution to be indirectly determined .",
    "this contribution can be parametrized in terms of the relative amplitudes of the tensor and scalar perturbations , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant . presently , due to measurement limitations ,",
    "a constant value of @xmath0 is fitted .    nevertheless , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that few inflationary models produce an exactly constant tensor to scalar ratio , and , in order to be proper scenarios of inflation , they must be observationally indistinguishable from power  law inflation , where @xmath16 too . since power ",
    "law inflation is just one of many suitable final stages of the inflaton dynamics @xcite , it implies that , either a constant value for @xmath0 may be no characteristic of the underlying inflationary evolution or that conclusions about the inflaton potential beyond an exponential form may be no possible to be drawn @xcite .",
    "this last factor could be a strong limitation for programs of the inflaton potential reconstruction .    taking the above into account ,",
    "the aim of this letter is to analyze the relation between the functional form of the tensor to scalar ratio and the inflationary dynamics . after introducing in sec .",
    "[ sec : keq ] the relevant equations , the analysis is done in sec .",
    "[ sec : sols ] by means of several examples .",

    "[ sec : disc ] and it is concluded that the difference between the spectral indices can be a very useful quantity because it yields information on the scale dependence of the tensor to scalar ratio , hence allowing to observe features of the inflaton potential different from the exponential form .",
    "the horizon  flow functions proved to be useful quantities while describing the inflationary dynamics and perturbations .",
    "they were defined in ref .  @xcite as @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the hubble distance , @xmath19 the number of e  folds since time @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . during inflation , @xmath22 . for @xmath23",
