    "graphene is a single - layer atomically thin allotrope form of carbon , where carbon atoms are arranged in a honeycomb lattice . owing to its single - atom thickness and unique electronic properties it is a promising material for technological use @xcite .",
    "although graphene was originally thought to be a pure system , recent scanning tunneling microscopy work shows that it is a disordered system @xcite .",
    "it has lattice defects , vacancies , ripples , dislocations , magnetic impurities , etc .",
    "particularly there are charge puddles caused by chemical adsorption or molecules trapped between the graphene lattice and substrate @xcite .",
    "previous studies of impurities have focused on understanding their effects on the ground state electronic properties of graphene @xcite . however , an equally important aspect is the study of the consequences of these charged impurities on the dielectric response for future electronic devices .",
    "several studies explored plasmonic excitations in pristine graphene @xcite .",
    "so far almost no work focused on localized plasmons ( nano - plasmons ) in graphene .",
    "these excitations have the ability to concentrate an electric field ( visible photons ) at the nanoscale regime , thereby beating the diffraction limit .",
    "the potential technological applications of this effect are vast .",
    "for example , it is possible to improve solar cell efficiency by increasing the cross section of the absorbing material without requiring a thick layer of it @xcite .",
    "another potential application is the new sub - field of photonics called plasmonics , where plasmons substitute photons in the information transport extending photonics into the nanoscale world @xcite . in biology",
    "the potential applications include labeling and imaging , optical sensing and photo - therapy treatment of cancer @xcite .    here",
    "we study nano - plasmons , that is , localized plasmonic excitations in pristine and disordered graphene .",
    "when plasmons are localized the translational invariance of the lattice is lost , hence analytical calculations become impractical .",
    "a self - consistent quantum - mechanical approach to nano - plasmons in graphene in the presence of impurities has been developed , which accounts for the non - locality of the dielectric response function @xcite .",
    "here we use a generalized version of this approach , where the polarization operator is diagonalized , providing information about individual plasmonic excitations , including spatial profiles and local spectral density of states .",
    "the calculation is performed for a single impurity at the center of the carbon hexagon .",
    "we study the impurity effect as a function of the sign , strength , and size of the impurity potential , and the doping level of graphene . the interactive use of three - dimensional ( 3d ) visualization allows us to identify readily which plasmonic excitations are localized vs.  delocalized .",
    "our visualization of the poles of self - consistently calculated polarization operators shows the existence of nano - plasmons around naturally occurring impurities in graphene , which confirms that graphene is an intrinsic plasmonic material @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the lattice model used to calculate the plasmonic excitations in graphene . in section 3",
    ", we describe the needs for an advanced 3d visualization tool to analyze complex multidimensional data sets and discuss the computational requirements .",
    "the results of the plasmonic modes are presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we perform a quantitative analysis of the symmetries of the various nano - plasmonic modes and conclude in section 6 .",
    "the electronic structure of graphene is described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the kinetic and potential energy , while @xmath2 is the coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "the interaction is treated as a perturbation and will be considered later in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) . the single - particle part of the hamiltonian on a lattice is @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes nearest neighbor sites ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are operators that create and annihilate electrons at site @xmath7 ; @xmath8 ev is the tight - binding hopping parameter , and @xmath9 is the chemical potential ( @xmath10 for undoped graphene ) .",
    "@xmath11 is the change in the on - site potential for atom at site @xmath12 due to the presence of an impurity at @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the strength of the impurity potential and @xmath15 determines its spatial spread .",
    "the matrix structure of the non - interacting hamiltonian @xmath1 is @xmath16 the diagonalization of the non - interacting single - particle hamiltonian @xmath17 gives eigenstates @xmath18 and eigenvalues @xmath19 which satisfy @xmath20 .",
    "each state has an occupation number given by the fermi function @xmath21^{-1}$ ] .    in order to compute the polarization operator due to an induced charge",
    ", we define the tensorial matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the basis of the eigenstates @xmath24 using the superindices @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which reshape a matrix into a vector in a column - wise fashion so while @xmath27 one has @xmath28 , the above tensors can be written as diagonal matrices @xmath29 and @xmath30 the polarization operator is a density - density response function . summing the product of non - interacting green s functions over matsubara frequencies",
    "@xmath31 one obtains the non - interacting polarization operator @xmath32 using the superindices @xmath33 and @xmath34 , one can write @xmath35 as the product of diagonal matrices @xmath36 which again is a diagonal matrix",
    ".    next we include the coulomb interaction @xmath2 for electrons on the lattice .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is written in terms of creation and annihilation operators in the lattice basis as @xmath37 where the only non - zero components are @xmath38 we can write @xmath2 in the basis of the eigenstates , where it will be a full tensorial matrix . therefore @xmath2 can also be represented as a matrix in the superindex space @xmath39 .    within the rpa calculation",
    "the polarization operator of the interacting system is given by @xmath40 using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : polariz ] ) we can write @xmath41 the nano - plasmonic excitations correspond to the poles of the polarization operator . hence the modes correspond to charge density oscillations with amplitude @xmath42 such that @xmath43 the matrix @xmath44 is diagonalized giving the eigenvalues @xmath45 and eigenvectors @xmath46 satisfying @xmath47 .",
    "the polarization has poles at @xmath48 for each eigenvalue @xmath45 of @xmath49 .",
    "one can then find the spatial profile of the mode with energy @xmath45 through @xmath50 . by going back to the lattice basis and neglecting the orbital overlap",
    "we get the local charge oscillation @xmath51 the amplitude of the induced charge density oscillation at site @xmath7 is the vector @xmath52 . of course the induced charge will oscillate with frequency @xmath45 , that is , @xmath53 .",
    "we use a standard numerically exact diagonalization method to solve eq .",
    "( [ eqn : condition ] ) .",
    "this allows us to find all the poles of the polarization operator and , thus , we obtain the complete information of the plasmonic excitations on the graphene lattice . for a lattice having @xmath54 sites ,",
    "the matrix size of @xmath55 becomes @xmath56 .",
    "the number of eigenmodes scales as @xmath57 for @xmath58 electron - hole pairs at half - filling . therefore the number of data points where the plasmon dispersion needs to be visualized scales as @xmath59 , which becomes rapidly a big number even for small lattice sizes .",
    "visualization plays an important role in scientific data analysis with a growing need for being able to visually analyze complicated data sets in three dimensions ( in real space ) and more ( in parameter space ) .",
    "the analysis of such data is always complemented by the ability to effectively interact with the data .",
    "interacting with multidimensional data sets in a 3d environment ( stereo display ) adds an additional advantage to navigating and seeing _ through _ complex data sets . although this advanced visualization feature is not always necessary for the data analysis .",
    "the need for visual analysis of large data sets ( larger than the size that a typical computer with a graphics card can process ) is growing .",
    "the problem is commonly tackled by using distributed parallel processing on multiprocessor units .",
    "here we discuss a specific example of analyzing a multidimensional , medium - sized data set ( on the order of megabytes ) .",
    "the data set has 200,000 to 300,000 points in three dimensional space . in this paper",
    ", we show the efficiency of a small - scale parallel rendering computer cluster as a possible solution .",
    "the data is obtained from a calculation of the spatial distribution of plasmonic excitations ( induced charges on lattice sites ) in pristine and impure graphene . since visual analysis of data combined with quantitative analysis provides a better understanding of the data studied , we present specific examples for the quantification of visual information using the open - source visualization tool paraview @xcite .",
    "we analyze the dispersion of the plasmonic excitation as a function of energy @xmath60 . since the graphene lattice is two dimensional , the analysis of the induced charge distribution on individual lattice sites as a function of energy @xmath61 adds one more dimension to the visualization problem . for a given impurity potential ,",
    "a single data set is already four dimensional ( 4d ) in the hyper - space of variables ( x , y , @xmath61 , @xmath62(x , y,@xmath61 ) ) .",
    "the x - y dimension is fixed by the number of lattice sites chosen for the calculation .",
    "we fixed it to be @xmath63 lattice sites .",
    "the z - dimension is determined by the number of possible energies @xmath61 of the plasmonic excitations . for 96 lattice sites",
    "the number of unique frequencies @xmath61 is about @xmath64 , and the number of induced charges as a function of frequency to be visualized is about @xmath65 . to specify the induced charge oscillation at each lattice site",
    ", we need one scalar value and three coordinates .",
    "further , we need at least two colors to represent the polarity of the induced charge . in three dimensions",
    "it is necessary to use a 3d glyph to represent the scalar value ( induced charge ) .",
    "we use a `` sphere glyph '' having at least 10 points of resolution for angle @xmath66 and 10 points for angle @xmath67 @xcite . in the xml unstructured grid data file format @xcite , for which the visualization tool paraview has a reader to input data , the size of the raw data file is about 10 megabytes . after using the 3d sphere glyphs , to represent the induced charge distribution ,",
    "the size of the data set to be processed becomes about 1.3 gigabytes @xmath68 megabytes .",
    "so the memory required by the computer to process the data becomes more than 100 times larger than the size of the original raw data set .",
    "one can use a single - processor computer with a high - end graphics card to analyze and post - process a couple of such data sets , but many data sets of this size can not be efficiently processed , let alone attempting a real - time or interactive data analysis . hence using a single - processor computer",
    "is neither time efficient nor practical and parallel rendering on multiple cores or cpus ( central processing units ) or multiple gpus ( graphical processing units ) becomes mandatory . in the remainder of this study we demonstrate how distributed parallel rendering on multiple cpus can solve the problem of large data sets .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "using an advanced visualization tool like paraview one can extract in addition to the _ obvious _ visual cues @xcite also quantitative information from the data set of interest .",
    "we demonstrate this capability by first plotting a histogram of the distribution of induced charges over all lattice sites and over all energies .",
    "the histogram is generated by applying the built - in ` histogram ' filter in paraview @xcite on a data set with impurity potential @xmath69 .",
    "this information may appear trivial , but is of interest to verify the conservation of total charge in our calculations , i.e. , the sum of all induced charges must vanish and must be equally distributed between positive and negative oscillations . since pristine graphene does not have localized plasmons , whereas impure graphene does , it is important to understand the rearrangement of induced charges .",
    "we can check for charge conservation and induced charge balance for two completely different cases , namely , localization vs.  delocalization of modes .",
    "the symmetric distribution of the induced charges as seen in the histogram or probability function of finding a specific induced charge in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram ] implies that the total induced charge is zero .",
    "we verified the charge neutrality by calculating the sum of the induced charges .    in both cases , pristine and impure graphene ,",
    "the number of zero - induced charges is significantly larger than the number of nonzero induced charges , i.e , lattice sites that are unaffected .",
    "however the number of zero - induced charges is slightly bigger in impure graphene than in pristine graphene .",
    "the magnitude of induced charges decrease exponentially in impure graphene , while it has a gaussian distribution in pristine graphene .",
    "the range of the magnitude of induced charges is slightly bigger for impure graphene .",
    "this implies that a relatively small number of plasmons acquires a bigger magnitude of induced charges .",
    "the larger number of zero - induced charges , as well as a wider range in the distribution of charges , and the exponential decrease are consequences of localized plasmonic excitations .",
    "next , we monitor the induced charge at a single site in the graphene lattice as a function of energy .",
    "the calculation is performed with or without the presence of impurity . for the impurity case",
    "the impurity potential is fixed at @xmath70 .",
    "we plot this information by using the built - in ` plot over line ' filter @xcite .",
    "it gives interpolated values of the variable along an arbitrary user - specified line .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : probe_line ] for a particular nearest - neighbor site of the impurity , marked by the arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : graphene_lattice](a ) .",
    "one also sees that the range of induced charges are bigger for the impure graphene .",
    "in addition , comparing fig .  [",
    "fig : histogram](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : probe_line](b ) one can see that the range of induced charges in impure graphene increases with increasing impurity potential from @xmath69 to @xmath71 .    finally , we extracted the energy - resolved spatial distribution of induced charges for pristine and impure graphene .",
    "as mentioned above , there are about 2300 plasmonic modes for a lattice with @xmath63 sites .",
    "it is very time consuming to extract every individual plasmonic excitation manually . however , this can be automated in paraview by using the sui ( script user interface ) .",
    "we developed a simple _ python _ script , which controls the rendering in paraview , to extract the distribution of the induced charges for all energies .",
    "it is worth mentioning that using a single - processor computer it is impractical to extract the necessary information in real time ( it takes several hours to resolve the spatial distribution for all energies ) .",
    "this computationally intensive problem can be overcome by running the sui in parallel rendering mode .",
    "since there are many unique plasmonic modes ( characterized by the unique induced charge distributions ) , it is impossible to report all of them .",
    "so we show only a few selected plasmonic modes in fig .",
    "[ fig : plane_cut_u=0 ] .",
    "one can clearly see that the cancellation of induced charges , which is required for the conservation of the total charge , can happen locally ( e.g. , pairwise ) or globally ( e.g. , in groups ) .",
    "some plasmons have simple patterns of dipolar , quadrupolar or triangular distribution of localized induced charges .",
    "however , others have non - trivial symmetries and correspond to higher - order multipoles .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : plane_cut_u=2 ] we show the energy - resolved spatial distribution of induced charges in impure graphene for a few selected plasmon energies with characteristic patterns .",
    "these charge distributions are very different from those of the pristine lattice .",
    "we can clearly see that the cancellation of induced charges can happen only over a larger area , because of the creation of localized plasmons .",
    "some of these modes have simple patterns of dipolar , quadrupolar , radial or triangular symmetry .",
    "however , others have highly non - trivial patterns , e.g. , clumps of similar charges on nearest lattice sites .",
    "the main result reported here is that the localization of plasmonic modes occurs at the nano - meter scale concentrating the electric field onto a very small area .",
    "we investigated through exact diagonalization the plasmonic excitations of graphene in the presence of a single impurity with a special focus on localized modes ( nano - plasmons ) near the impurity .",
    "the dependence of excitations on the model parameters such as the sign , magnitude , size of the impurity potential and number of electrons in graphene was discussed .",
    "it was shown that the impurity potential and doping can be used to tune the properties of nano - plasmonic excitations , demonstrating that graphene is an inherently plasmonic material .",
    "taking nano - plasmons in graphene as a case study , we demonstrated the importance of a three - dimensional , interactive visualization tool to explore and analyze large data sets in a more effective and time efficient way .",
    "we described the visualization problem faced with , even when the data set is only several megabytes in size .",
    "this issue arises when the data set is intrinsically multidimensional in both real space and parameter space . as a solution to this problem",
    ", we proposed a small - scale parallel processing approach , because it can no longer be efficiently handled by a single - processor computer . finally , using an interactive visualization tool we could extract even more quantitative information leading to a better understanding of the physical properties of nano - plasmons on a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "the results discussed can be tested , in principle , in experiments by high - frequency optical probes or local scanning tunneling spectroscopy probes . however , in order to achieve such tests , calculations of extended or nano - sized impurity clusters are very desirable as they would give plasmonic excitations spread over a larger size with smaller frequencies .",
