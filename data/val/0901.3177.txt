    "the sixth data release from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al . 2000 ) presented the complete photometry of the galactic cap as well as further spectroscopy with improved calibrations ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "previous releases are detailed by stoughton et al .",

    "this paper continues the series of identification of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) from the available spectra , with each paper comprising the objects found in spectra obtained in a given calendar year ( szkody et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , 2007 ; papers i - vi ) .",
    "the results for the cvs found in plates obtained in 2006 are presented here .",
    "these objects include dwarf novae , novalike systems and systems containing highly magnetic white dwarfs ( a comprehensive review of all the various kinds of cvs is contained in warner ( 1995 ) ) .",
    "the number of cvs found in sdss now constitute a significant sample of uniform ( in resolution and wavelength coverage ) spectra for over 200 objects , and population studies and implications of the results for different types of cvs are emerging ( schmidt et al .",
    "2005 ; gnsicke et al .",
    "while the sdss is not a targeted cv survey and not all objects in the photometric sky coverage have spectra obtained to find cvs , gnsicke et al .",
    "( 200 ) compare the sdss sample with the past palomar green and hamburg quasar surveys and consider selection effects .",
    "they conclude that the primary advantages of sdss lie in its great depth and the large amount of spectroscopic followup of candidates .",
    "the increased depth results in a significant difference in the period distribution found from the sdss sample of cvs compared to these previous ( brighter ) surveys in that the majority of the sdss cvs are found at periods below 2 hrs and there is an overabundance of systems at periods between 80 - 86 min .",
    "this distribution and period spike follow the predictions of cv evolution models more closely than past surveys .",
    "the above results stem from concentrated efforts by many people in the community to obtain follow - up photometry and spectroscopy in order to determine the orbital periods and characteristics of the cvs in the sdss database ( gnsicke et al .",
    "( 2008 ) summarize available results for 116 , almost half of the total number ) .",
    "our brief descriptions of the spectra and our few followup observations are intended to aid these followup studies .",

    "2002 , richards et al .",
    "2002 ) already exist in the literature .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that objects in the imaging data are chosen for spectra from colors that match criteria selected by various working groups .",
    "cvs are primarily found that match colors of quasar , serendipity , and white dwarf groups , as the cvs can be blue if they contain a thick disk , red if they contain a polar and both red and blue if the disk is thin and the individual stars are viewed ( typical colors of the cvs found in sdss are plotted in color - color diagrams shown in papers i , ii ) . while table 1 shows that the cvs that do have spectra encompass a wide range of color , this does not guarantee that all the cvs in the imaging area covered have spectra obtained .",
    "the search of all spectral plates that are obtained is accomplished via a software program that selects all objects with balmer emission / absorption lines and the selected spectra are visually examined .",
    "all the spectra on a few plates were visually examined to evaluate the effectiveness of the selection algorithm . while a few are missed if they are very faint or they are misidentified , we estimate the software finds about 90% of the existing cvs .",
    "table 1 lists the cvs found in sdss spectra from 2006 jan 1 through dec 31 , with the plate , fiber , and modified julian date ( mjd ) of each spectrum .",
    "there are also a few objects that were missed in previous years and later recovered .",
    "the coordinates are given as equinox j2000.0 , with the iau convention of truncation rather than rounding at the last decimal , and the coordinates have an astrometric accuracy of 0.10 arcsec .",
    "photometric magnitudes and colors are from the point - spread function photometry and there is no correction for interstellar reddening . for ease of reference , we will hereafter refer to the objects as sdssjhhmm ( hours and min of ra ) .    for a few objects , we were able to accomplish followup spectroscopy with the apo 3.5 m telescope , using the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) with the high resolution gratings ( resolution about 2 ) with a 1.5 arcsec slit ( table 2 ) .",
    "two of these followup objects are from cvs found in previous papers ( sdssj0812 from paper v and sdssj1006 from paper vi ) .",
    "the spectra were obtained over several hours and were used to construct radial velocity curves .",
    "calibration for flux and wavelength , as well as measurements of the lines were accomplished with standard iraf routines .",
    "the sdss spectra were measured with the centroid - finding `` e '' routine in the iraf @xmath0 package to obtain the equivalent widths and fluxes for the balmer and helium emission lines ( table 3 ) . for the radial velocity curves ,",
    "a least squares fit of a sine curve to the velocities was used to find @xmath1 ( systemic velocity ) , k ( semi - amplitude ) , p ( orbital period ) , and @xmath2 ( the epoch of red to blue crossing of the systemic velocity ) ; the results are given in table 4 .",
    "note that due to the short time baseline of the data , the periods are only estimates ( with about 10% accuracy ) and will need several nights of further data for better determinations .",
    "our measurements , however , provide a starting point as to whether systems have short or long periods .",
    "the sdss spectra for the 39 systems are shown in figure 1 and the equivalent widths and fluxes of the prominent hydrogen balmer and helium emission lines are listed in table 3 .",
    "a summary of the various categories of objects is given below .",
    "of the 39 entries in table 1 , 12 are cvs that were found prior to sdss spectra . these include the novalike leo5 ( 1h1025 + 220;sdssj1029 ) and seven dwarf novae : boo1 ( sdssj1504 ) , gy cnc ( sdssj0909 ) , go com ( sdssj1256 ) , ny ser ( sdssj1513 ) , qw ser ( sdssj1526 ) , iy uma ( sdssj1043 ) and hs1340 + 1524 ( sdssj1343 ) .",
    "leo5 was previously identified as a cv candidate during follow - up of heao-1 sources , and spectroscopically confirmed by munari & zwitter(1998 ) .",
    "boo1 was discovered as a faint emission line star by filipenko et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , who tentatively classified the object as a dwarf nova , even though no outburst was observed , and no follow - up observations have been obtained so far .",
    "gycnc was identified as an eclipsing dwarf nova with @xmath3min ; an updated ephemeris is given by feline et al .",
    "gocom has been long known as a dwarf nova ( brun & petit 1957 ) , and had @xmath4min determined by howell et al .",
    "nyser was identified as a cv in the palomar - green survey ( green et al .",
    "1986 ) , and a short outburst cycle was noted by iida et al .",
    "nogami et al . ( 1998 ) measured a superhump period of 153min , making nyser the first suuma type dwarf nova in the period gap between 2 - 3 hrs where few cvs are found ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "patterson et al . (",
    "2003 ) determined the orbital period as 140.4min .",
    "qwser was identified as a dwarf nova by takamizawa ( 1998 ) , and @xmath5min was determined by patterson et al .",
    "iyuma is another eclipsing dwarf nova with an @xmath6min ( uemura et al .",
    "2000 ) , for an updated ephemeris see steeghs et al .",
    "hs1340 + 1524 ( sdssj1343 ) is a dwarf nova with infrequent short outbursts , and @xmath7min ( aungwerojwit et al .",
    "2006 ) .    finally , there are four previously known polars among the sdss cvs presented here .",
    "two of them were observed in a low state : stlmi ( sdssj1105 ) , one of the few polars identified in the optical ( shore et al . 1982 ) with @xmath8min ( schmidt et al .",
    "1983 , cropper 1986 ) ; and euuma ( sdssj1149 ) , discovered with rosat ( mittaz et al .",
    "1992 ) with @xmath9min ( howell et al .",
    "the two other polars were observed by sdss during high states , mrser ( sdssj1552 ) , identified in the pg survey ( liebert et al .",
    "1982 ) with @xmath10min ( schwope et al . 1991 ) , and rxsj161008.0 + 035222 ( sdssj1610 ) , identified as a rosat polar by schwope et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2002 ) , with recent polarimetry published by rodrigues et al .",
    "( 2006 ) which refined the orbital period to 109.5 min .",
    "table 1 also includes four polars that we found since paper vi which have detailed information recently published ( schmidt et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) ; we include them in the table for completeness : sdssj0921 , sdssj1031 , sdssj1059 , and sdssj1333 .",
    "of these , sdssj1031 and sdssj1059 belong to the group of extremely low mass transfer rate polars , while the rest are normal polars with high and low states of accretion .",
    "note that the magnitudes listed for sdssj0921 and sdssj1333 in schmidt et al .",
    "2008 are in juxtaposed order in their table ( the magnitudes are actually in order of @xmath11 instead of @xmath12 as labeled .",
    "previous work on sdss systems has shown that those with deep central absorption in the balmer lines typically have high inclination and show photometric eclipses .",
    "two systems , sdssj1057 and sdssj1524 ( figure 1 ) , show this central absorption , and are promising candidates for having deep eclipses of the white dwarf by the secondary star .",
    "while cvs can be generally identified by their emission line spectrum , the identification of a dwarf nova requires that an outburst is apparent .",
    "this can be apparent from a difference in the sdss photometry versus the spectra ( which are obtained at different times ) or as large differences in magnitude in past usno or dss catalogs or in other non - sdss observations .",
    "the known dwarf nova qw ser ( sdssj1526 ) was caught at outburst in the sdss spectra ( figure 1 ) while the photometry ( table 1 ) is consistent with its normal quiescent magnitude near 18 .    * _ sdssj1005 : _ * a report of an outburst of this object by brady & pietz ( 2009 ) recently appeared in the vsnet , thus providing a classification for this system .",
    "subsequent searches of asas-3 data as reported by kato ( 2009 ) showed previous outbursts near 12.5mag in 2003 and 2006 .",
    "our followup apo time - resolved spectra during quiescence in 2007 produced consistent results from the h@xmath13 and h@xmath14 emission lines .",
    "the period obtained from both lines is near 113 min and the k amplitude is low ( figure 3 and table 4 ) .",
    "while further data over several nights will be needed to pin this down precisely , it is apparent that this is likely a low inclination , short period system that is near the lower edge of the period gap .",
    "the preliminary superhump period reported by brady & pietz is identical to our spectroscopic period within the accuracy reported .",
    "* _ sdssj1619 : _ * the sdss photometry ( table 1 ) and spectrum ( figure 1 ) show a typical cv at quiescence , with an optical magnitude near 18.5 and balmer emission lines with a flat decrement . however , our followup apo spectra ( table 2 and figure 2 ) show a much brighter source ( near magnitude 15.5 ) with strong 4686 emission as well as weaker balmer emission flanked by broad absorption .",
    "the apo spectra are typical of dwarf novae at outburst , where the increased accretion at outburst results in the high excitation he line and an optically thick accretion disk which produces the broad absorption .",
    "thus , we can narrow the classification of this object to that of dwarf nova .",
    "our time - resolved apo data covered close to two hours of observation , but our measurements of the h@xmath13 , h@xmath14 and emission components did not reveal any periodic radial velocity variation outside of random variability that was @xmath15 20 km / s .",
    "thus , either this system has a low inclination , a long period , or the emission lines at outburst are too distorted by the underlying absorption to extract the underlying orbital motion .",
    "further observations during quiescence are needed to determine its orbital period .    *",
    "_ sdssj1627 : _ * a superoutburst has recently been detected by shears et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who determined a superhump period of @xmath16min .",
    "since the superhump period is usually only a few percent different from the orbital period ( warner 1995 ) , this system appears to be one of the few in the @xmath17 orbital period gap .",
    "the 4686 line is a strong indicator of a polar or of high accretion .",
    "all of the polars mentioned in section 3.1 show this line ( except for the two with extremely low accretion rates ) . in addition to these known polars ,",
    "figure 1 reveals three other systems with unusually strong 4686 .    *",
    "_ sdssj1549 : _ * this object has a very peculiar spectrum , showing a strong continuum , weak balmer emission but very strong .",
    "the sdss spectrum is very similar to that of uma 6 ( sdssj0932 ) shown in paper v. uma 6 has a very long orbital period for a cv ( 10 hrs ) and a deep optical eclipse ( hilton et al .",
    "our 2.5 hrs of apo time - resolved spectroscopy ( table 2 ) showed 40 km / s variability in both h@xmath13 and but no simple sinusoidal motion consistent with an orbital radial velocity .",
    "thus , this system will require much longer monitoring to ascertain its nature .    * _ sdssj0938 : _ * the spectrum of sdssj0938 looks typical for a polar ( figure 1 ) in a high state of accretion .",
    "it is virtually identical to the known polar sdssj1610 also in figure 1 .",
    "spectropolarimetry will be able to provide definitive information on this issue . while our apo observations ( table 2 ) were not long enough to obtain an orbital period , a smooth , large amplitude ( 70 km / s ) variation throughout the 65 min is consistent with a polar with a period that is under 2 hrs .",
    "* _ sdssj0935 : _ * while this object has stronger than h@xmath14 emission ( figure 1 and table 3 ) , the spectral appearance is different than for the above two objects .",
    "the continuum is very strong and the emission lines are broad and weak .",
    "this spectrum appears more like an old nova than a system containing a magnetic white dwarf ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "the ability of sdss to obtain spectra of cvs that are fainter than previous surveys has resulted in discovering many systems that have low accretion rates , hence accretion disks which do not overwhelm the light of the underlying stars . in these cases ,",
    "the white dwarfs are revealed through their broad absorption lines flanking the balmer emission and , if the secondary star is a late main sequence object , it is evident by tio features in the red . from figure 1 , it is apparent that sdssj1005 , sdssj1057 and sdssj1605 show the white dwarf , while sdssj0230 , sdssj1059 , sdssj1105 , sdssj1544 show an m star ( sdssj1105 and sdssj1059 are known polars with no accretion disk ) and sdssj0805 appears to show a k star ( albeit of somewhat later type than the k stars in sdssj0615 and sdssj0805 found in paper vi ) .",
    "the spectra of systems with accretion disks can show a large range in variety ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows five systems with strong , blue continua : sdssj0758 , sdssj0901 , sdssj0935 ( already mentioned in section 3.4 ) , sdssj1054 , and sdssj1513 .",
    "most of these are likely to be novalikes with large accretion rates .",
    "sdssj1054 may be questionable as it could be just a white dwarf and a faint active but non - interacting m star .",
    "two spectra taken 26 days apart exist in the sdss archive for this object and they show minor differences in the structure of the balmer emission and absorption lines which could be due to a close binary so we have left this in the list .",
    "followup spectroscopy will determine the correct classification .",
    "the systems with weaker continua and stronger emission lines are likely candidates for short orbital period systems with lower mass transfer . for our followup apo spectra , we generally concentrated on these latter systems due to the way observing time is scheduled in half - nights .    * _ sdssj1557 : _ * this object has strong , broad balmer emission lines that are typical for dwarf novae systems .",
    "our 2.5 hrs of time - resolved spectra revealed a sinusoidal modulation with a period near 2 hrs , which is the lower end of the period gap ( table 4 and figure 4 ) .",
    "the amplitude is typical for dwarf novae .",
    "the object will need to be followed photometically to detect an outburst and confirm this as a dwarf nova .",
    "* _ sdssj0812 : _ * followup 3.5 hrs of time - resolved spectra of this cv that was first reported in paper v shows a high amplitude radial velocity curve with a period near 3.7 hrs , close to the length of the dataset ( table 4 and figure 5 ) .",
    "this object thus appears to be above the period gap and have a higher accretion rate than the majority of sdss cvs that have periods less than 2 hrs .",
    "* _ sdssj1006 : _ * this system from paper vi was targeted for followup spectra as it shows strong emission lines plus tio bands from its secondary star .",
    "however , 100 min of spectra do not reveal a clear sinusoidal variation .",
    "there is a jump in velocities in both h@xmath13 and h@xmath14 from red to blue ( with no change in comparison lamps taken near these times ) and there is a decline in flux in the spectra at this time .",
    "these properties could be an indication of an eclipse , so additional data on this object could produce interesting results .",
    "ten of the objects in table 1 have been detected with the rosat all sky survey ( rass ; voges et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "the exposure times and count rates are listed in table 5 . among the 10 detections",
    "are the known polars eu uma , mr ser and rxj1610 + 03 and the dwarf novae gy cnc , go com , qw ser and hs1340 + 15 .",
    "several of the sources are only in the faint source catalog with marginal detections ( no error is listed for the faint detection of sdssj1005 ) . the lack of detection of the other polars such as st lmi and the larps detailed in schmidt et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) are indications of states of very low mass transfer for those systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the detection of sdssj0938 lends further support for this object being a possible polar . as in uma 6 ,",
    "the strong heii present in sdssj1549 is not correlated with x - ray emission .",
    "the addition of these 39 objects to the previous list brings the total number of cvs in the sdss database to 252 , of which 204 are new discoveries .",
    "there are now more than 100 cvs with known or estimated orbital periods ( see gnsicke et al .",
    "2008 for a recent summary ) .",
    "the distribution of periods of objects from sdss is significantly different than previous surveys with brighter limits .",
    "the sdss objects exist predominantly at short periods and show a period spike at 81 min , as predicted by binary evolution theories .",
    "thus , this database can serve as a testbed for evolution and further period determinations will refine these numbers",
    ".    the following objects should be of high interest for future studies .",
    "followup photometry , spectroscopy and especially polarimetry of sdsjs0938 will confirm if this system contains a magnetic white dwarf .",
    "photometry of sdssj1057 and sdssj1524 is likely to reveal eclipses which can determine inclinations and periods .",
    "sdssj1006 from paper vi may also have eclipses .",
    "high time - resolution photometry of sdssj1005 , sdssj1057 and sdssj1605 should be done to search for pulsations of the white dwarf .",
    "long term photometry of sdssj1549 is needed to determine if the large differences in magnitude that are apparent are due to a long orbital period with eclipses ( like uma 6 ) or different states of low and high accretion .",
    "spectroscopy ( especially in the ir ) for the two systems showing indications of the secondary star ( sdssj0230 and sdssj1544 ) can produce better information on the secondary and the likely longer orbital periods in these two systems .",
