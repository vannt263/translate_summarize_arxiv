    "in recent years novel findings have been uncovered in speckle patterns of waves coherently transmitted through a disordered medium .",
    "the most interesting among them are intensity fluctuations with long - range correlation including power - law and `` infinite - range '' correlations .",
    "the latter are related to the `` universal conductance fluctuations '' in disordered metals .",
    "the theory of speckle arising due to the multiple scattering was developed in  @xcite .",
    "experimental testing was done for microwave  @xcite as well as for visible light  @xcite .",
    "recently the study of light propagation in disordered amplifying media has begun .",
    "this problem is different from a conventional radiation diffusion in a disordered medium because here scattering also provides a feedback for light generation and , therefore , upon a certain condition an amplifying disordered medium becomes a generator of coherent radiation  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite authors observed laser action in a dye dispersed in a weakly scattering medium .",
    "amplification allows for probing the longest paths that light travels in the system .",
    "this brings a modification of coherent backscattering  @xcite which was observed in  @xcite .",
    "it would be natural to carry on these studies by an observation of speckle correlations of light scattered from an amplifying medium .",
    "in this paper we consider correlations in intensity of light transmitted through a disordered amplifying medium .",
    "some statistical properties of such a medium were discussed in  @xcite .",
    "statistical properties of lasing states  @xcite and transmission distribution function  @xcite were considered .    here",
    "we calculate the frequency and angular correlation functions of the transmission coefficient of a diffusive amplifying medium .",
    "we approach the problem in a way that resembles that of  @xcite .",
    "we show that near the lasing threshold the correlation function consists of three terms just as in the case of an elastic medium . however , the structure of the terms is different . the first term ( @xmath0 ) which describes the contribution of noninteracting diffusion modes has a power - law decay .",
    "there is no `` memory effect '' : the term depends separately on the momentum differences of the incoming and outgoing waves .",
    "the contributions from interaction of diffusion modes are more singular near the lasing threshold compared to @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath1 term has the same dependence on the incoming and outgoing momentum differences as the @xmath0 .",
    "the `` infinite - range '' correlation observed in an elastic medium is also present in our case , but it has a much larger relative magnitude .    in frequency dependence of the correlation function near the threshold",
    "there appears a correlation scale which decreases close to the lasing threshold .",
    "the dependence is the same in all three terms .",
    "we also calculated time correlation function in the case of a nonstationary dielectric function fluctuations , caused by freely moving point scatterers .",
    "we obtain short- and long - range time correlations .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the basic quantities which we use in our calculations such as the average green s function of the wave equation and the field - field correlation function . in section 3",
    "we define the transmission coefficient and calculate the average value of it .",
    "we also discuss here the weak localization correction to the diffusion coefficient .",
    "in section 4 we calculate the angular and frequency correlation functions of the transmission coefficient and time correlation in the case of nonstationary inhomogeneities .",
    "we consider the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a weakly disordered amplifying medium .",
    "we start with a scalar linear wave equation derived from maxwells equations : @xmath2\\,e\\,=\\,0\\ ] ] here @xmath3 is the wavenumber , @xmath4  the complex dielectric function .",
    "it is of the form @xmath5 , where the average part : @xmath6 @xmath7 describes the response of oscillating dipoles of frequency @xmath8 and mass @xmath9 . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the densities of the dipoles in the excited and low states correspondingly ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "@xmath13 corresponds to the lifetime of the excited state .",
    "we will consider the propagation of electromagnetic waves with frequencies @xmath14 in an interval near the atomic frequency much smaller than broadening @xmath15 so that we can neglect the dispersion of the dielectric function .",
    "thus we consider @xmath16 as a negative constant and suppose that @xmath17 .",
    "now let some defects or impurities cause fluctuations of the real part of the dielectric function . then : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a random function with the following properties : @xmath20 and @xmath21 here angular brackets denote averaging over realizations of the disorder .",
    "@xmath22 is simply related to the mean free path of the radiation @xmath23 : @xmath24    in the lowest order of the disorder parameter @xmath25 the average green s function of the equation  ( 1 ) is : @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the length @xmath28 is the amplification length .",
    "the properties of light energy transport in a disordered medium are determined by the field - field correlation function : @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the field of frequency @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath31 equals @xmath32  the average intensity at a point @xmath33 of the field of frequency @xmath14 .    in the leading order of the disorder parameter the field - field correlation function is given by the sum of the ladder diagrams : @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the nonscattered field at a point @xmath33 and @xmath36 satisfies the equation : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a diffusion coefficient .",
    "let us also introduce the light energy current density : @xmath41 it can be easily shown using ( 9 ) ( see @xcite ) that : @xmath42 taking into account a conservation law : @xmath43 one obtains a diffusion equation for the average intensity : @xmath44    equations  ( 12)(14 ) describe the propagation of radiation in a medium with dimensions which are larger than the mean free path  @xmath23 .",
    "we consider a sample in the form of a slab with dimensions @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where the sides @xmath47 are open and the other side surfaces are perfectly reflecting .",
    "we suppose that @xmath48 .",
    "the slab has a critical width @xmath49 . if @xmath50 the system becomes a multimode generator @xcite .",
    "we will measure the size of the system in the units of the critical size : @xmath51 we suppose that @xmath52 .",
    "the case of @xmath53 corresponds to the experimental setup of  @xcite .",
    "the opposite limit @xmath54 was realized in  @xcite .",
    "critical conditions for this case are very different from  ( 15 ) and the critical value of amplification length is of the order of the mean free path  @xcite .",
    "the total phase diagram amplifier - generator is shown on fig.1 .",
    "more discussion of the critical conditions can be found in  @xcite .",
    "calculations in the case @xmath55 are beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "consider the transmission of monochromatic light through the slab described in the previous section .",
    "we define the transmission coefficient of the light of frequency @xmath14 incident at an angle @xmath56 on the plane @xmath57 and transmitted at an angle @xmath58 as the ratio of the emergent flux per unit solid angle around the direction @xmath59 to the incident flux .    from ( 9 ) and",
    "( 11 ) one has for the transmission coefficient : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the incident intensity .",
    "the corresponding to the equation ( 16 ) diagram is shown on fig.2 .    for the equation ( 10 ) for function @xmath62 we assume the following boundary conditions : @xmath36 is zero on the boundaries @xmath47 and the current through the side surfaces is zero .",
    "then near the threshold one can calculate the function @xmath63 as : @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "in ( 17 ) we neglect contributions which are nonsingular at @xmath66 .",
    "hence one obtains : @xmath67 integration over angles gives the average coefficient of the total transmission : @xmath68 the transmission coefficient contains an additional amplification factor @xmath69 compared to the case of an elastic medium .",
    "let us now consider the weak localization correction to the diffusion coefficient in equation ( 14 ) in the limit @xmath70 .",
    "weak localization has been extensively studied in physics of disordered conductors (  see for review  @xcite  ) and we may use the well known results .",
    "localization correction to the diffusion constant is given by maximally crossed diagrams .",
    "the analytical expression is : @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the volume of the slab and cooperon @xmath73 satisfies in the case of stationary inhomogeneities eq.(10 ) and has therefore form  ( 17 ) . substituting it in ( 20 )",
    "one obtains : @xmath74\\ ] ] here @xmath75 is a quantity analogous to the dimensionless conductance of a weakly disordered metal .",
    "let us note that there is no correction to @xmath76 in eq.(14 ) .",
    "for @xmath77 the correction in ( 21 ) coincides with that for electrons in a small closed metallic particle .    for small @xmath78 , such as @xmath79 ,",
    "the correction is of order unity . in our case",
    "it means that at a time @xmath80 diffusion approach breaks down and transport is dominated by only a few lasing states . at zero @xmath78",
    "the condition of smallness of the correction is @xmath81 .",
    "average quantities do not describe the transmission of light in a random system completely . in this section",
    "we consider fluctuations of the transmission .",
    "we study the following correlation function : @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "it might be represented as @xcite : @xmath84 contribution @xmath0 describes noninteracting diffusion modes .",
    "interaction between them brings contributions @xmath1 and @xmath85 .",
    "the diagram corresponding to @xmath0 is shown on fig.3 .",
    "the calculations leading to an expression for @xmath86 are analogous to the calculations of the average transmission coefficient .",
    "the only modification needed is to take into account a change in the phase of the incident or transmitted wave due to a change in the angle of incidence or transmission : @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the difference between the wave vectors of the incident(@xmath56 ) or transmitted(@xmath58 ) waves corresponding to different measurements .    from ( 17 )",
    "and ( 24 ) one obtains : @xmath89 where @xmath90 @xmath1 term can be represented as @xmath91 . due to reciprocity relations both terms are equal for @xmath92 .",
    "let us note the following .",
    "the scatterers in the disordered medium can be considered as sources of light , which are phase or amplitude correlated .",
    "accordingly we can divide the terms constituting the speckle correlation function in two groups .",
    "terms @xmath0 and @xmath93 correspond to phase correlated , @xmath94 and @xmath85  to amplitude correlated sources .    to calculate the amplitude correlated terms it is convenient to use the langevin approach  @xcite .",
    "according to this approach the fluctuating part @xmath95 of the light energy current can be expressed as : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the langevin random current . using conservation law : @xmath98",
    "one can write for the fluctuating part of the intensity : @xmath99 with the help of ( 26 ) and ( 28 ) we can obtain an expression for the fluctuating part of the total current through the surface @xmath100 . to calculate the correlation function of the total current we need an expression for the correlation function of the langevin current .",
    "near the lasing threshold the langevin currents correlation functions are given by the following expressions : @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 correlation functions ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) contribute to @xmath94 and @xmath85 correspondingly .",
    "diagram for correlation function ( 29 ) is shown on fig.4 and diagrams for the three terms in ( 30)on fig.s 5a , b , c  @xcite .",
    "calculating fluctuations of the total current we obtain : @xmath106\\ ] ] @xmath107    let us now discuss our main results ( 25 ) , ( 34 ) and  ( 35 ) .",
    "note first , that there is no `` memory effect '' in the @xmath0 term  it depends separately on @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the form - factor function @xmath110 has an oscillating power - law decay .",
    "the form - factor is exactly the same as in the case of transmission through an elastic scattering medium in the form of a long tube  @xcite .",
    "the `` memory effect '' is also absent in such a medium .",
    "integrating @xmath1 over the angles of transmission we obtain the mean square fluctuation of the total transmission  @xcite : @xmath111 one sees that the transmission near the lasing threshold is not a self - averaging quantity : fluctuations of total transmission grow faster than the average value .",
    "the @xmath112 term just as in the case of an elastic medium represents an `` infinite - range '' correlation in momentum space .",
    "however , the relative magnitude of this correlation is much larger in our case due to the factor @xmath113 .",
    "close to the threshold all terms in the speckle correlation function have the same frequency dependence .",
    "the scale of the frequency correlation is determined by a parameter @xmath114 , which goes to zero at @xmath66 .",
    "interaction between diffusion modes according to ( 34 ) and ( 35 ) is described by a parameter @xmath115 , contrary to the case of a nonamplifying medium where the parameter is @xmath116 .",
    "the increase of interaction can be interpreted as follows . in the case of",
    "an elastic disordered system transmission probes the path of typical length of order @xmath117 . in our case amplification",
    "compensates for escape of a wave , therefore transmission probes paths of much longer lengths and probability of interference increases .",
    "we should point out that the value of parameter  @xmath118 in our formulas can not be infinitely small .",
    "@xmath119  corresponds to the threshold in the equation for the average intensity .",
    "actually the threshold value of @xmath118 is a random function of frequency , such that its mean square fluctuation is of the order of  @xmath120  @xcite .",
    "it means that our consideration is valid for @xmath121 .",
    "note that this condition is more restrictive than the condition of smallness of the weak localization correction @xmath122 in eg .",
    "( 14 ) .",
    "so far we assumed that the fluctuations of the dielectric function which scatter light are stationary .",
    "however it is also interesting to consider the correlation function @xmath123 ( @xmath124 is the transmission coefficient @xmath125 measured at time @xmath126 ) in the case of nonstationary fluctuations .",
    "note that we will consider correlations with a fixed incident channel @xmath127 .",
    "in the simple case of freely moving point scatterers @xcite one obtains : @xmath128 @xmath129\\ ] ] here @xmath130 @xmath131    @xmath132    and @xmath133 is the time for a scatterer to move a wavelength .",
    "we do not consider the @xmath85 term because in the present case it does not contain additional features compared to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    to derive the above results one needs to modify the dielectric function fluctuation s correlation function ( 5 ) to take into account the motion of the scatterers .",
    "in the case of freely moving scatterers with a characteristic velocity much less than the velocity of light in the medium this correlation function averaged over the angle of scattering becomes  @xcite : @xmath134 where @xmath135\\,\\approx\\,1\\,-\\,t^2/2\\tau_{\\lambda}^2 $ ] and @xmath126 is the time difference variable .",
    "then it is easy to show that function @xmath136 describing the correlation of fields @xmath137 measured with a time interval @xmath126 satisfies the equation : @xmath138 therefore near the threshold it is given by an expression : @xmath139 the further calculations follow the same lines as those in the case of stationary scatterers .    according to ( 37 ) and ( 38 ) there exist short - range time correlations @xmath140 and @xmath141 with a scale @xmath142 and long - range time correlation @xmath143 .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated angular , frequency and time correlation functions for the transmission of light through a disordered amplifying medium .",
    "the correlation function in the case of stationary dielectric function fluctuations consists of three terms like in an elastic scattering medium .",
    "the angular dependence of the correlation function is exactly the same as in an elastic medium with tube geometry .",
    "this similarity is due to the absence in the emitted radiation of memory about the incident radiation in both cases .",
    "frequency correlation has a scale @xmath144 at @xmath145 .",
    "it is the same for all three terms .",
    "interaction between diffusion modes is strongly enhanced near the lasing threshold .",
    "the enhancement of transmission fluctuations is more pronounced than the enhancement of weak localization near the threshold .    in the case of nonstationary dielectric function fluctuations ,",
    "speckle correlation function consists of terms with short- and long - range time correlations .",
    "the short - range correlation has a scale @xmath146 at @xmath66 .",
    "interaction between diffusion modes is suppressed by the motion of the scatterers .",
    "although our calculations were performed in the case of all sample dimensions being larger than the mean free path , we believe that our results also apply to the case @xmath55 . probably only the  interaction parameter  @xmath147 and definition of parameter @xmath148 will be modified",
    ".    experimentally it would be interesting to realize the crossover between the both cases in one system .",
    "probably , a good candidate is an amplifying liquid crystal near the phase transition , which unduces strong changes of transparency .",
    "recent experiments @xcite show that it is possible to realize the multiple scattering regime in a liquid crystal .",
