    "typical star - forming galaxies in the nearby universe are supported by systematic rotation , with random velocities playing a relatively minor role .",
    "this indicates a degree of maturity the galaxies are old and established , and their reservoirs of star - forming gas are dominated by material that was accreted at least one orbital time ago .",
    "however , at the epoch when cosmic star formation reached its peak , it is likely that galaxies were still accreting gas rapidly .",
    "the relative roles of rotation and velocity dispersion in providing support to such galaxies could thus be significantly different .",
    "certainly , the morphologies of star - forming galaxies at @xmath9 suggest _ some _ differences in their typical properties : regular spirals constituted a much smaller fraction of galaxies at @xmath9 than they do today .",
    "dynamical observations of star - forming galaxies at @xmath9 are challenging .",
    "one successful approach has been to study strong rest - frame optical emission lines , which are redshifted to near - ir wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "spatial resolution is generally limited by seeing to @xmath10 , which yields a few resolution elements across the disk of the galaxy . for a minority of cases it has been possible to achieve significantly higher spatial resolution , either by using adaptive optics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or by observing strongly lensed galaxies @xcite .",
    "spectral resolution is also usually modest ( @xmath11 , corresponding to @xmath12 ) , since the faint flux levels of @xmath9 emission lines usually preclude the lower sensitivity of high resolution spectrographs .",
    "we here adopt a complementary approach to studying the dynamical support of @xmath9 star - forming galaxies .",
    "we use [ cii ] 158  line observations from the _ herschel _ extreme lensing line observations ( hello ) program @xcite , obtained using the hifi instrument @xcite on the _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite .",

    "the question then is where the [ cii ] emission comes from .",
    "[ cii ] can trace neutral gas , since carbon has a lower ionization potential than hydrogen .",
    "the brightest [ cii ] emission in a galaxy comes from photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ) .",

    "we summarize the key observational information for these two objects below .",
    "both were identified as candidate lens systems through a search for blue objects near luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) in _ sloan _ digital sky survey imaging , followed by visual inspection for arc - like morphology @xcite .",
    "0901  was confirmed as a strongly lensed galaxy at redshift @xmath23 by @xcite .",
    "the lens is a galaxy group , dominated by a luminous red galaxy at @xmath24 @xcite , and containing another half dozen smaller galaxies .",

    "our primary conclusions in the present paper are essentially independent of the lensing amplification .",
    "the clone ( ) was first identified as a strongly lensed galaxy at redshift @xmath33 by @xcite .",
    "the lens is again a group , here with three identified members , dominated by an lrg at @xmath34 @xcite .",

    "they modeled the lensing geometry based on ground - based imaging , finding an einstein radius @xmath36 , and an amplification factor @xmath37 .",
    "the lensed galaxy s rest - frame optical spectrum @xcite is that of a star - forming galaxy , with no evidence for agn activity . detected lines include h@xmath17 , h@xmath28 , [ oii ] , [ oiii ] , and [ sii ] .",
    "the clone s mid - ir spectrum is again that of a normal star - forming galaxy , with prominent pah emission features @xcite .",
    "more recent lens modeling , using higher resolution _ hubble space telescope _",
    "images @xcite , gives a refined amplification @xmath38 .",
    "( this is the total amplification for all lensed images combined , as appropriate for our spatially unresolved hifi observation . )",
    "@xcite also estimated the star formation rate for .",
    "they scaled from the h@xmath17 flux , assumed a @xcite initial mass function , and corrected for gravitational lensing amplification ( @xmath14 , see below ) .",
    "they obtained @xmath39 before dust correction , and @xmath40 to @xmath41 after dust correction ( depending on the adopted reddening indicator ) .",
    "they did not estimate a star formation rate for 0901 , given their concerns about the possible role of an agn .",
    "we can obtain a crude upper limit on the sfr of 0901  by neglecting agn contributions to h@xmath17 and applying the same scalings used for .",
    "this yields @xmath42 , prior to any dust correction .",
    "we observed the _ hello _ sample using the hifi wide - band spectrometer ( wbs ) with 1.10 mhz resolution . we used dual beam switching with fast chopping , to achieve the best possible baselines in our spectra . for 0901 , we used mixer band 1b and a total observing time of 3000s , of which 885s was on - source integration time . for , we used mixer band 1b with a total observing time of 6200s , of which 1977s was on - source integration time .",
    "our data reduction which we discuss in greater detail in @xcite followed mostly standard hifi procedures .",
    "the last step of this analysis was to fit and subtract a baseline from each spectrum .",
    "this means that the spectra used in the present paper are `` line - only '' spectra , insensitive to the presence of continuum emission .",
    "the hifi wbs offers an intrinsic velocity resolution of @xmath43 at the frequency of the redshifted [ cii ] line in our targets . however , each 1.10 mhz resolution element has a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath44 in our data . our ability to distinguish fine detail in the spectral line profiles",
    "is therefore effectively limited by sensitivity , since we can detect features only when we combine enough frequency channels to get @xmath45 of a few in the feature .",
    "we plot the [ cii ] spectrum of 0901  in figure  [ fig : s0901_spec ] and of  in figure  [ fig : clone_spec ] , both at 25   binning .",
    "0901  has a flux of @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , and yields a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath48 per bin for 11 bins above half - maximum intensity .",
    "is fainter , with a flux of @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , and yields @xmath51 per bin for six bins above half - maximum intensity .",
    "we discuss these flux measurements further in @xcite , in the context of the full hello sample .",
    "in addition to the spectra , we plot model line profiles from our fitting procedures in figures  [ fig : s0901_spec ] and  [ fig : clone_spec ] .",
    "the observed [ cii ] emission line profiles depend on the rotation curves of the lensed galaxies .",
    "they also depend on the spatial distribution of the emitting gas , which determines how the different parts of the rotation curve are weighted in forming the line profile . to model the line profiles , we adopt commonly used fitting functions for the distributions of both emitting material and of mass ( which in turn determines the rotation curve ) .    for the radial distribution of [ cii ] surface brightness",
    ", we have assumed an exponential disk model ( @xmath52 } = \\sigma_0 \\exp(-r/\\rcii)$ ] ) , which is able to produce models that fit the observed lines well ( see below ) .",
    "of course , this does not mean that the gas distribution _ must _ follow an exponential distribution .",
    "different tracers of galaxies interstellar gas often follow different distributions .",
    "neutral hydrogen ( hi ) tends to have a spatially extended distribution .",
    "molecular gas can be centrally concentrated ( as in many starbursts and ulirgs ) , or can show ring features , as in both our own galaxy and m31 .",
    "h@xmath17 comes primarily from dense , ionized gas , and often shows complex and patchy distributions that trace the distribution of young star forming regions .",
    "a double - horned line profile basically requires that most of the emitting material be in significant motion with respect to the center of mass .",
    "given that galactic rotation curves rise steeply in the central regions and then flatten out , there are two `` usual '' ways to achieve this .",
    "first , the gas can be in an extended disk , with most of the mass on the flat part of the rotation curve .",
    "this is the common case for hi @xcite .",
    "second , the gas can be in a more compact ring - like configuration , with little material to emit in the regions where rotation is slow .",
    "this has been observed , e.g. , for co line emission in ngc 759 @xcite . since [ cii ] 158",
    "@xmath14 m emission comes in some combination from the diffuse warm neutral medium , photon - dominated regions at molecular cloud surfaces , _ and _ ionized regions , we do not expect a simple analogy with other main ism tracers .",
    "we begin by considering the extended disk possibility in detail , and then examine how our conclusions would be affected for the case of a [ cii ] ring .",
    "we model the rotation curve using a disk + halo model for the gravitating mass .",
    "the halo has mass volume density @xmath53 and an asymptotic rotation speed @xmath54 .",
    "the disk component has mass surface density @xmath55 and a peak rotation speed @xmath56 .",
    "we can relate @xmath56 to other disk parameters as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the total mass of the exponential disk .",
    "@xmath56 corresponds to the circular speed for the disk mass interior to @xmath59 .",
    "we model the line - of - sight gas velocity dispersion ( due to thermal _ and _ turbulent motions ) as a gaussian with rms width @xmath60 , which is convolved with the line profile produced by ordered rotation .    because our targets are spatially unresolved in hifi data , our predicted line profile is insensitive to a global rescaling of all radii by a common , constant factor .",
    "we therefore fix the scale length @xmath61 of the surface brightness distribution throughout the modeling , and rewrite the scale lengths of the disk and halo in dimensionless form as @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , the line profile depends on the line - of - sight velocity @xmath64 ( where @xmath65 is the inclination angle of the disk ) but can not distinguish changes in @xmath65 from changes in @xmath66 .    the line shape is then determined by a total of five free parameters : three velocities ( @xmath56 , @xmath54 , and @xmath60 ) , and two scale length ratios ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) .",
    "we need two further parameters , the redshift @xmath69 and total line flux @xmath70 , to completely specify the line .    before fitting the disk+halo rotation curve models",
    ", we recast the three velocity parameters in a new form that reduces correlated uncertainties in the parameter space .",
    "since the observed line profile is determined by gas kinematics _ where the light is emitted _ , we define the rotational speed contributions due to the halo and disk , @xmath71 and @xmath72 measured at the half - light radius of the [ cii ] disk ( which is @xmath73 ) .",
    "we then define the _ total ordered rotation speed _",
    "@xmath74 at the half - light radius by @xmath75 we further define @xmath76 the parameter @xmath77 now contains essentially all the information required to determine the [ cii ] line width .",
    "the relative importance of random and ordered motions is captured by the velocity ratio @xmath78 while the relative importance of disk and halo terms in the potential is captured by @xmath79 the transformation is essentially from cartesian coordinates to spherical polar coordinates for the three - space of velocity parameters , with the @xmath80 parameters corresponding to ( co)tangents of two angles .",
    "the final set of parameters for fitting then becomes @xmath81 . by recasting the three velocity parameters ,",
    "we eliminate major degeneracies between @xmath56 , @xmath54 , and @xmath60 , all of which have the same lowest - order effect of increasing the model line width .",
    "now , @xmath77 determines line width , while the remaining parameters control the shape of the line whether it is singly or doubly peaked ; the splitting of the peaks and depth of the gap between them ; and the shape of the high - velocity line wings .",
    "we fitted the rotation curve models to the data using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) approach ( more specifically , the metropolis - hastings algorithm ) . in brief , the method consists of a chain of random steps in our parameter space . in each step , the algorithm first identifies a trial solution that is offset from the current solution by some randomly determined amount .",
    "the likelihood of the trial solution is compared to that of the current solution .",
    "the trial solution is adopted as the new solution whenever its likelihood is higher .",
    "if its likelihood is lower , it may still be adopted as the new solution , with a probability equal to the ratio of likelihoods .",
    "after many steps , the distribution of accepted points provides an unbiased estimator for the probability distribution of the model parameters .",
    "since consecutive steps of the chain are highly correlated , we record the state of the chain every 100 steps , so that the autocorrelation among the recorded points in parameter space is weak .    over 99% of the mcmc solutions for 0901  under the disk+halo rotation curve model",
    "lie in a single region of parameter space , where rotation dominates over a small or negligible amount of random motion .",
    "a representative fit is shown in figure  [ fig : s0901_spec ] , and its parameters are given in table  [ tab : bestfitparams ] .",
    "the distribution of mcmc samples in the ( @xmath82 , @xmath60 ) plane is shown in figure  [ fig : vr_sig ] .",
    "only 5% of the samples have @xmath83 ; 1% have @xmath84 ; and only 0.5% have @xmath85",
    ". moreover , the rotational motions are usually dominated by the disk component ( with @xmath86 , and with @xmath87 in 85% of samples ) .",
    "this conclusion is robust , being readily explained by examination of the observed line profile .",
    "the line is double - horned with a central dip , and with rotation curve sides that are steep but not vertical .",
    "models dominated by velocity dispersion ( @xmath60 ) are expected to be single - peaked .",
    "models dominated by a halo ( with small core radius and without a significant disk contribution ) would have vertical sides , except for the influence of the velocity dispersion . under our adopted rotation curve model ,",
    "the best way to get a double - peaked profile with slanting sides is to have a rotation curve that rises to a peak ( driven by the disk component ) and then declines towards somewhat smaller rotation speeds ( perhaps dominated by the halo component ) .",
    "our [ cii ] line profile fitting in  yields a range of viable models .",
    "the maximum likelihood fits are double - peaked models with very small velocity dispersions , much like the fits for 0901 .",
    "however , these models occur in a rather small volume of the sampled parameter space . the mcmc fitting for",
    "also yields single - peaked , dispersion - dominated fits ( with @xmath88 ) in about 45% of all samples .",
    "these have appreciably lower likelihoods , but occupy a large volume in parameter space . for",
    ", we have plotted a few different models , all statistically acceptable fits to the data .",
    "these include the maximum likelihood model identified , which is dominated by a disk with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and has @xmath91 .",
    "we plot also a second double - peaked profile and two dispersion - dominated single peaked profiles .",
    "parameters for all are summarized in table  [ tab : bestfitparams ] .",
    "the last of these plotted models was selected to be consistent with the parameters that @xcite dervied based on h@xmath17 observations ( see section  [ sec : halpha ] ) .",
    "our fitting yields other parameters in addition to @xmath82 and @xmath60 .",
    "the most robust and model - independent are the redshifts ( which we report in the local standard of rest [ lsr ] frame ) . for 0901",
    ", we find @xmath92 } = 2.25860 \\pm 0.00007 $ ] .",
    "this matches precisely the rest - frame optical redshift ( @xmath93 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) derived from h@xmath17 , [ nii ] , and [ oiii ] emission lines , while it is slightly higher than the rest - uv redshift of @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "this gives a net blue - shift of @xmath95 for the uv spectral features , relative to [ cii ] .",
    "the @xcite redshift is from a cross - correlation of the 0901  spectrum with a template from @xcite , making it a weighted average of the lyman-@xmath17  line redshift and the redshift from uv absorption lines ( which are , individually , mostly too faint to measure well in 0901 ) .",
    "to the extent that this represents a lyman-@xmath17  redshift , it is an unusual result lyman-@xmath17  is generally redshifted with respect to other velocity tracers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a blueshift of this magnitude for lyman-@xmath17  would be worth further investigation .    for , we find @xmath96 .",
    "this can be compared to the measurements @xmath97 and @xmath98 , both from rest - uv absorption lines reported by @xcite but based on different spectra taken at two different telescopes . comparing our [ cii ] redshift to the weighted average , @xmath99",
    ", we infer that the gas responsible for the uv absorption lines is blue - shifted by @xmath100 with respect to the [ cii ] emitting gas .",
    "this is typical of the absorption line blueshifts that are seen in many high - redshift galaxies , and that are thought to be caused by absorption by gas in a galactic wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we consider how our conclusions would be affected by changing some of the assumptions behind our rotating disk model .",
    "first , we explore the possible effects of differential gravitational magnification by applying separate amplification factors to the approaching and receding portions of the galaxy . taking the overall mean amplification to be @xmath101 and",
    "the ratio of red - side to blue - side amplification to be @xmath102 , we have amplifications of @xmath103 for the blue side and @xmath104 for the red side .",
    "we apply this differential magnification to the predicted line profile before accounting for the velocity dispersion , thus avoiding a sharp step function at the systemic velocity .    for 0901 , we find that the distribution of this new parameter is sharply peaked near unity : 98.64% of simulated samples are in a primary peak centered at @xmath105 , with dispersion of @xmath106 .",
    "the 1.3% of simulations with more extreme ratios are all velocity - dispersion dominated models , where the asymmetry introduced in the magnification is hidden by the random motions of the gas .",
    "the only correlation between @xmath102 and other model parameters is a trivial correlation with model redshift : an offset in redshift that would move the modeled flux centroid away from the observed flux centroid can be compensated by raising the peak of the line profile that falls nearest the observed flux centroid , and lowering the amplitude of the other peak .",
    "the addition of @xmath102 does not alter the distributions of other model parameters in any qualitatively important way .    for , the @xmath102 parameter",
    "is not strongly constrained .",
    "models having @xmath107 generally have @xmath108 , but dispersion - dominated models can yield acceptable fits with any value of @xmath102 . with the addition of @xmath102 , about 3/4 of the fits end up with @xmath109 .",
    "we also explored the possibility of a ring - like gas distribution . we take the limiting case by assuming _ all _",
    "the emitting gas rotates with a single circular speed @xmath110 .",
    "the intrinsic line profile is then proportional to @xmath111 , potentially modified by the differential amplification parameter @xmath102 described above , and convolved with a gaussian of width @xmath60 to account for velocity dispersion within the ring . in total , this is a five - parameter model : @xmath112 .",
    "qualitatively , our key results are unchanged under this model : we again find that 0901  is rotationally supported , and that  admits a range of acceptable models . in closer detail , we do see some differences .",
    "the full disk models described above can smooth the line profile of a single ring both through velocity dispersion and through the combination of multiple rings with different circular speeds .",
    "the single - ring model can only soften the sharp edges of the double - horned profile through the effects of velocity dispersion .",
    "thus , values of @xmath113 are common in the full disk model for 0901   but rare among the single - ring fits .",
    "similarly , the distribution of @xmath114 tends to slightly higher values under the single - ring model .",
    "our exploration of ringlike gas distributions leads to two main conclusions .",
    "first , alma observations will be tremendously valuable in determining the spatial distribution of the emitting gas in cases like these .",
    "second , our conclusion that 0901  is rotationally supported is robust to plausible variations in the gas geometry .",
    "both 0901  and  have previously published kinematic constraints in the form of h@xmath17 line widths ( @xmath115 ) . to compare our [ cii ] results to these",
    ", we use our kinematic models to predict the h@xmath17 line width @xmath116 that would be expected , after accounting for the lower spectral resolutions of the published h@xmath17 observations .",
    "we do this by convolving our model line profile(s ) with a gaussian whose width @xmath117 matches the reported line spread function of the h@xmath17 observations ; measuring the fwhm @xmath118 of the convolved line profile ; and calculating the lsf - corrected line width @xmath119 .",
    "we finally convert the result back to velocity units for ease of comparison ( @xmath120 ) .    for 0901 ,",
    "@xcite report @xmath121 ( fwhm ) , with a spectral resolution @xmath122  fwhm , corresponding to @xmath123 fwhm at @xmath124 wavelength . for our best - fitting model , the procedure described above yields @xmath125",
    "if we apply the same procedure to the full set of models produced by the mcmc fitting , the mean and standard deviation of the result becomes @xmath126 .",
    "combining in quadrature the scatter in our simulations and the uncertainty reported by @xcite , our models predict a line width that is smaller than the observed h@xmath17 line width at the @xmath127 level .",
    "if the difference is real , there are a few possible explanations .",
    "first , the true lsf of the keck spectrum could be 1821  ( 250300@xmath128 ) fwhm , rather than the published measurement of 15  ( 210@xmath128 ) fwhm @xcite .",
    "second , the [ cii ] and h@xmath17 observations might sample different portions of the galactic disk .",
    "observations certainly sample the entire galaxy , while nirspec s @xmath129 slit could omit outer regions of the galactic disk .",
    "third , the kinematics of [ cii ] and h@xmath17 could be genuinely different .",
    "if large velocity dispersions are associated with turbulence driven by star formation activity @xcite , the kinematic effects of star formation would be most strongly apparent in h@xmath17 , which is closely associated with star formation activity .",
    "the pdr gas that contributes strongly to [ cii ] emission is found at the `` skin '' layers of molecular clouds , and may yet retain the comparatively quiescent kinematics of molecular gas .",
    "kinematic constraints for  have been reported both by @xcite ( slit spectroscopy ) and @xcite ( integral field unit [ ifu ] spectroscopy ) . to compare to @xcite",
    ", we followed the same procedure we used for 0901 .",
    "the best fitting model gives an expected line width of @xmath130 fwhm , while the mean and standard deviation for all the mcmc runs was @xmath131 .",
    "the observed h@xmath17 line width is consistent with these expectations , at @xmath132 fwhm ( again with @xmath122  fwhm ) .",
    "the h@xmath17 ifu spectra reported by @xcite offer a more detailed comparison , with spatially resolved spectra at a spectral resolution of @xmath133 .",
    "their full measured rotation curve ( i.e. the range of centroid velocities of h@xmath17 emission across the resolved image ) spans @xmath134 , with a line - of - sight velocity dispersion of @xmath135 ( * ? ? ? * table  4 ) .",
    "the results depend , again , on subtracting the instrumental lsf width in quadrature , but this time the lsf is narrower than the measured line width .",
    "the @xmath136 velocity dispersion corresponds directly to our @xmath60 parameter .",
    "the correspondence between the @xcite parameter @xmath137 and our rotation speed parameter @xmath82 is less direct .",
    "while we roughly expect @xmath138 , our parameter refers to the rotation speed at the half - light radius of the [ cii ] emission , while @xmath139 is measured across the full extent of the h@xmath17 emission .",
    "still , we expect the kinematic parameters from @xcite to fall in the range @xmath140 and @xmath141 . while this is far from our _ best - fitting",
