    "nonequilibrium growth models of clusters of identical particles have attracted a lot of attention in the last two decades @xcite .",
    "certainly , the most studied one is the diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) model proposed by witten and sander @xcite for the modeling of metal particle aggregation . in spite of its simplicity ,",
    "this model is a noteworthy example in which a very simple algorithm generates disordered patterns with nontrivial scaling @xcite . in the dla model ,",
    "the particles are released at points distant from the cluster and follow random walks of unitary steps , which are stopped when these particles contact the cluster and irreversibly aggregate to it . another important aggregation model with nontrivial",
    "scaling is the ballistic aggregation ( ba ) @xcite , in which ballistic trajectories at random directions replace the random walks characteristic of the dla model . differently from the dla case ,",
    "the patterns generated by the ba model are asymptotically homogeneous ( fractal dimension equal to the space dimension ) , but this asymptotic regime is characterized by a power law approach @xcite .",
    "several generalized versions of the dla model were proposed @xcite , including those concerned with the transition between dla and ba models @xcite . in a recent work , ferreira _ et al . _",
    "@xcite built a model in which the particles follow random trajectories with drifts at random directions .",
    "the bias is controlled by a parameter @xmath8 that , when varied , leads the model from ba ( @xmath9 ) to dla ( @xmath8=1 ) .",
    "the clusters are asymptotically non - fractal ( exhibiting the ba - like scaling with fractal dimension @xmath10 ) for any @xmath11 , but following a dla - like scaling ( @xmath12 ) for short length scales . using the concept of scaling functions , these ideas can be summarized as @xmath13 in which @xmath14 in these equations , @xmath15 is the size of the cluster , @xmath16 is the space dimension , @xmath17 is the dla fractal dimension , and @xmath18 is the characteristic crossover radius from dla- to ba - like scaling regimes . the last diverges as @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "this transition between dla and ba regimes was introduced by meakin @xcite in a early generalization of the dla model .",
    "this model is very similar to that analyzed by ferreira _",
    "the main difference is that the drift of all trajectories is fixed at a lattice direction in the meakin s model , in which , along the trajectory , the particle is moved one step in the drift direction with probability @xmath21 , or moves at random to one of its four nearest - neighbor sites with probability @xmath22 .",
    "the model generates patterns with a growth tendency along the opposite direction of the drift . in this work",
    ", meakin argued that the crossover radius scales as @xmath23 while nagatani @xcite , through a real - space renormalization group approach , found @xmath24 .",
    "early studies indicated that the dla aggregates exhibit distinct scaling exponents for radial and angular correlations .",
    "the two - point correlation function @xmath25 , which gives the probability to find a particle at a distance between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , from another particle , is given by @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "for off - lattice dla , the exponent found was @xmath31 . in turn , the angular correlation function @xmath32 , which gives the probability to find two particles with angular separation @xmath33 measured in relation to the origin at a distance @xmath34 , follows a power law decay for small @xmath33 @xmath35 for uniform self - similar fractals @xmath36 , but this was not observed for the dla model , for which @xmath37 @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we used careful simulations to analyze the transition between dla- and ba - like regimes in a model where both random and ballistic trajectories are included . differently from the previously described models @xcite , the trajectories are not characterized by distinct behaviors at short ( random ) and large ( ballistic ) scales .",
    "indeed , we are interested in the scaling of clusters grown from a mixture of particles , which can follow either ballistic or random trajectories .",
    "the paper outline is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , the algorithm and the computer implementations are described . in section",
    "[ sec : scaling ] , the quantities describing the scaling of the cluster are introduced and the corresponding results discussed .",
    "finally , we summarize the results of the paper in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the present model is concerned with the aggregation of particles which can follow either ballistic or random trajectories .",
    "notice that there are two kinds of independent trajectories , which do not exhibit both random and ballistic components simultaneously , as those used in reference @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional off - lattice simulations starting from a single particle of unitary radius stuck to the origin were considered .",
    "the model s rules are very simple . for each time step , a kind of trajectory , brownian or ballistic , is chosen with probabilities @xmath38 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "then , particles are launched one at a time using the selected rule until one of them sticks to the cluster .",
    "notice that in these rules we are taking in to account only particles , which are added to the cluster and not those that get too far from the cluster and are excluded .",
    "the particles are released at a launching circle of radius @xmath39 centered at the origin , where @xmath40 is the largest distance from the origin among all the aggregated particles . as in the off - lattice dla model @xcite ,",
    "the cluster grows when a walker contacts any particle of the aggregate and sticks to the corresponding position .",
    "also , if the walker crosses a killing circle of radius @xmath41 centered at the origin , it is discarded and a second one released at a new random point on the launching circle .",
    "the previously introduced variables ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) should be as large as possible . however , computational limitations restrict their values . for sake of convenience ,",
    "we introduce a new variable @xmath44 by the definition @xmath45 .",
    "the choices of @xmath44 and @xmath43 depend on the kind of trajectory . for random walks",
    ", @xmath42 can be a few particle diameters larger than @xmath40 whereas @xmath43 must be very large @xcite .",
    "consequently , we used @xmath46 and @xmath47 . for ballistic trajectories",
    "undesirable shadow effects are reduced as @xmath42 increases @xcite .",
    "thus , we used @xmath48 .",
    "finally , ballistic trajectories which crosses the launching circle can not turn back inside the circle and , so , we chose @xmath49 .",
    "large scale off - lattice simulations with rigorous statistical sampling require very efficient algorithms .",
    "firstly , it is necessary to improve the efficiency of the routines for the trajectories . in the case of random walks , we used a standard method , in which particles outside the launching circle take long steps @xmath50 if these steps do not bring up a particle inside the launching circle .",
    "an adequate choice is @xmath51 , where @xmath26 is the distance of the walker from the origin .",
    "also , in the inner region of the circle delimiting the cluster there are large empty regions .",
    "so , we adopted an algorithm like those used by ball and brady @xcite , in which particles inside the launching circle can take a long step of length @xmath52 if they can not cross any part of the aggregate along this long step .",
    "an efficient determination of @xmath52 is decisive in order to guarantee the success of the procedure . in order to accomplish this",
    ", we define a coarse - grained mesh with cells of size @xmath53 as illustrated in figure [ fig : otm_in ] .",
    "the boxes depicted in gray are those in which the random walk could reach the cluster after a step of length @xmath52 and , consequently , a long step is forbidden . in this case , we have two options : the particle executes a unitary step or tries a shorter step of length @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , using another auxiliary coarse - grained mesh .",
    "indeed , we can use several auxiliary meshes in order to maximize the algorithm efficiency . in this work , three values , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , were used . through this procedure ,",
    "large simulations become up to two orders of magnitude faster than those using only long steps outside the launching circle .    finally , an efficient search mechanism for determining when the walker has or not a contact with the aggregate is indispensable .",
    "we used two procedures for this task . in the first one ,",
    "the particle positions are mapped on a square lattice by the approximation of their real coordinates to the nearest integer , producing an on - lattice auxiliary cluster .",
    "so , the verification of the contact is done only if the particle is inside a nearest or a next - nearest empty site neighboring the on - lattice auxiliary cluster . in the second optimization procedure , a coarse - grained mesh of cells @xmath58",
    "was used to limit the verification on a region near the walker position .",
    "the model exhibits a smooth transition from dla to ba - like growth patterns as the parameter @xmath0 varies from @xmath59 to @xmath60 . in figure",
    "[ fig : pads ] , in which growth patterns for distinct probabilities @xmath0 are shown , one can observe clusters that are qualitatively very similar to the dla aggregates for @xmath61 , whereas ba - like clusters are observed for @xmath62 .",
    "these patterns were grown until a part of them reaches the edge of a region of size @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .",
    "notice that @xmath65 is an important case , in which a half of the particles were grown using dla model and the another half were grown using the ba model .",
    "the scaling properties of the clusters were characterized by the radial and angular distributions of the particles , as well as , the size of their active ( growing ) zone .",
    "we grew 2d off - clusters limited by a region of size @xmath66 .",
    "again , the simulations were stopped when the cluster reaches border of this region .",
    "the radial scaling was characterized by the fractal dimension and the lacunarity @xcite . the fractal dimension @xmath67 and the lacunarity @xmath68",
    "were determined using the mass - radius and the radius of gyration methods .",
    "the mass - radius method consists of counting the number of particles @xmath69 in a hypersphere of radius @xmath26 centered at the origin .",
    "we expect a power law relation for self - similar clusters @xmath70 where the amplitude @xmath71 is a measure of the lacunarity . to be more precise , the dla clusters are characterized by a multiscaling , which leads to a slow convergence to the asymptotic scaling exponents . however , large scale simulations confirm that these clusters are asymptotically fractal . for details see references @xcite .",
    "the radius of gyration @xmath72 is defined as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the distance from the origin of the @xmath75th aggregated particle and @xmath76 the total number of particles in the cluster .",
    "the gyration radius scales with the number of particles as @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 can be related to the lacunarity trough the relation @xmath80 notice that @xmath81 since their definitions are different .",
    "but , they exhibit the same qualitative behavior because @xmath82 .    in figure [",
    "fig : mass](a ) , the double logarithm plots of the curves @xmath83 against @xmath26 are shown for several @xmath0 values .",
    "the slope continuously increases from @xmath84 for @xmath85 ( a value close to the well - known dla fractal dimension @xmath86 @xcite ) towards @xmath87 as @xmath0 increases , as can be seen in figure [ fig : mass](b ) , in which the fractal dimension is plotted as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "remarkably , instead of the qualitative behavior observed for the fractal dimension ( an increasing function of @xmath0 ) , the lacunarity is a convex function of @xmath0 with a maximum at @xmath88 , as shown in inset of figure [ fig : mass](a ) .",
    "these results show that if the number of dla particles is larger than the number of ba ones , an increasing @xmath0 produces patterns with more dense branches ( larger @xmath67 values ) but with larger empty regions ( larger lacunarity ) . however , when the number of ba particles exceeds the number of dla ones , the width of the branches increases while the size of empty regions decreases with @xmath0 .",
    "an explanation for such a behavior can be obtained from the active zone analysis described next .",
    "we define the active zone as the fraction @xmath89 of the latest particles added to the cluster , and its width @xmath90 as the standard deviation of the distances from the origin of these particles .",
    "so , @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93    in all simulations we used @xmath94 . in figure",
    "[ fig : w_ps ] , the width of active zone as function of the number of particles is shown for two distinct @xmath0 values . for @xmath95 ,",
    "the simulations indicate that there is a single power law regime @xmath96 while a crossover between two power laws @xmath97 for small length scales and @xmath98 for large ones is observed for @xmath99 . in the asymptotic regime ( @xmath100 ) , the exponent @xmath101 for @xmath102 as observed in the dla model @xcite . for @xmath103",
    ", we found @xmath104 and @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "indeed , our simulation suggests that @xmath108 as @xmath109 , in agreement with the statement that interface scaling of the ba belongs to the kardar - parisi - zhang universality class @xcite . to be more precise ,",
    "the interface scaling of ballistic deposition models were widely studied and rigorous simulations confirmed that @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "a very interesting feature emerges from the behavior of @xmath111 as a function of @xmath0 for a fixed mean radius of the active zone , as shown in inset of figure [ fig : w_ps ] .",
    "the active zone width is a convex function of @xmath0 with a maximum at @xmath112 , which explains the lacunarity dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "the onset of this qualitative behavior can be understood through an analysis of the screening properties of the clusters : for @xmath113 , the patterns have large grooves and the ballistic trajectories can reach the inner regions of the cluster forbidden for random walks .",
    "thus , the screening is reduced in relation to the original dla model and , consequently , the active zone is enlarged .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , more particles break the screening enlarging the active zone . however , if too many particles arrive at the inner regions of the clusters , the size of the their grooves and , consequently , their active zones are reduced .",
    "therefore , the convexity of @xmath111 versus @xmath0 was elucidated .",
    "intriguingly , this change of behavior seems to occur when the number of dla and ba particles are equal , but we can not provide a rigorous justification besides the numerical evidence .",
    "one of the most complex features of dla clusters is their multiscaling structures @xcite , which was recently analyzed by mandelbrot _",
    "et al . _ at the light of the angular gap distributions of the clusters @xcite .",
    "they found that the angular and radial distributions of mass scale with the same exponent @xmath114 only for very small angular gaps .",
    "this happens for asymptotically large clusters ( @xmath115 ) when the number of main branches increases leading to a more uniform space fulfillment . from figure",
    "[ fig : pads ] , one can see that angular gap distributions vary with the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , a angular scaling analysis becomes necessary in order to obtain a more elaborate characterization of model .",
    "for this task , we followed the work of meakin and vicsek @xcite , in which they analyzed the angular correlations of the dla model using the following procedure .",
    "a narrow circular shell of radius @xmath34 and width @xmath116 centered at origin is divided in @xmath117 identical sectors of area @xmath118 , where @xmath119 . for a box centered at the polar",
    "coordinates @xmath120 , the quantity @xmath121 is defined , where @xmath122 is the number of particles within this box .",
    "the two - point angular correlation function is given by @xmath123 the exponent obtained for the relatively small dla clusters ( @xmath124 ) using this procedure was @xmath125 , which is definitely different from @xmath31 .",
    "figure [ fig : ang ] illustrates the angular correlation functions evaluated at @xmath126 for distinct @xmath0 values . in all curves , @xmath127 decays as a power law for small angles followed by a global minimum and reaches a constant value for large angles .",
    "this behavior qualitatively reproduces the finds by meakin and vicsek @xcite , but the power law exponents decay with @xmath0 as illustrated in inset of figure [ fig : ang ] , in which @xmath128 and @xmath129 , as well as , the difference between them @xmath130 are plotted as functions of @xmath0 . the exponent @xmath129 was determined using the relation @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the mean fractal dimension obtained through the mass - radius and radius of gyration methods ( figure [ fig : mass](b ) ) .",
    "the difference @xmath133 observed for the dla model decreases with @xmath0 .",
    "the minima of the curves are interesting quantities since they represent estimates of the half angular separation between two consecutive branches , the gaps studied by mandelbrot _",
    "_ @xcite . the minima position shift to small angles and",
    "become less evident with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , the extrapolation of minimum positions suggests that their values vanishes at @xmath5 following a power law @xmath134 , where @xmath135 , as shown in figure [ fig : thetamin ] .",
    "the minima were determined using a cubic fit around their positions , as indicated in insets of figure [ fig : thetamin ] .",
    "this power law relation means that the angular gaps are present , even that small , for any @xmath136 .",
    "however , one can resolve from inset of figure [ fig : ang ] , the difference @xmath137 vanishing for @xmath138 .",
    "thid behavior of @xmath137 agrees with the concluding claim of mandelbrot _ et al . _",
    "@xcite concerning the asymptotic scaling of ordinary off - lattice dla clusters .",
    "indeed , in our model the gaps are reduced with increasing @xmath0 and , consequently , we observed the same result of reference @xcite , but without considering simulations with more than @xmath139 particles .",
    "in this work , we analyzed an aggregation model in which two kinds of particles are considered : a given fraction following brownian motions and the remaining following ballistic trajectories .",
    "the model , which includes diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) and ballistic aggregation ( ba ) models as limit cases , is controlled by a probability @xmath0 that correspond to the fraction of ba particles which constitutes the aggregate .",
    "large scale simulations and careful statistical sampling were used to characterize the radial and angular scaling of off - lattice aggregates . specifically , we measured the fractal dimension @xmath67 , the lacunarity , the width of active ( growing ) zone @xmath111 , and the angular correlation function @xmath32 of clusters grown for distinct @xmath0 values .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath67 continuously increases from @xmath140 for @xmath3 ( dla fractal dimension ) to @xmath4 ( ba fractal dimension )",
    ". however , the lacunarity and the width of the active zone for a fixed radius are convex functions of the probability @xmath0 with maxima at @xmath88 .",
    "the convexity of the lacunarity is directly related to the convexity of the active zone width , which in turn , was explained by the screening impairing the wandering particles to reach the inner regions of the clusters .",
    "the angular correlation function @xmath127 evaluated at @xmath126 exhibits a power law decay for small angles with a exponent that is a decreasing function of @xmath0 .",
    "the difference between angular and radial exponents observed for the original off - lattice dla model @xcite was found , but it rapidly vanishes for @xmath7 . also , the curves @xmath32 versus @xmath33 exhibit global minima representing the half angular separations between two consecutive branches .",
    "the simulations show that the position of the minima vanishes as @xmath109 following a power law @xmath134 with @xmath135 .",
    "these results indicate that the patterns are asymptotically homogeneous when @xmath109 . in summary , in this work",
    "we show how the scaling properties of the aggregates can be controled by varying the concentration of the kinds of wandering particles involved in the growth process . finally , it is important to emphasize that these results are in agreement with the angular gap distribution analysis performed by mandelbrot _",
