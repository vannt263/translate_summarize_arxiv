    "firstly electric circuit models representing a quantum particle in the one - dimensional potential @xmath0 were considered by kron in 1945 @xcite .",
    "three types of equivalent circuits were established .",
    "the first one contains positive and negative resistors and in each state the currents and voltages are constant in time .",
    "the second and third models are similar and consist of inductors and capacitors and the currents and voltages are sinusoidal in time . here",
    "we consider the stationary schrdinger equation in two - dimensional billiards in hard wall approximation @xmath1 where the dirchlet boundary condition is implied at the boundary @xmath2 of the billiard : @xmath3 here we use cartesian coordinates @xmath4 which are dimensionless via a characteristic size of the billiard @xmath5 , and correspondingly @xmath6 .",
    "there is a complete equivalence of the two - dimensional schrdinger equation for a particle in a hard wall box to microwave billiards @xcite .",
    "a wave function is exactly corresponds to the the electric field component of the tm mode of electromagnetic field : @xmath7 with the same dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "this equivalence is turned out very fruitful and allowed to test a mass of predictions found in the quantum mechanics of billiards @xcite . on the other hand , models for",
    "the equivalent rlc circuit of a resonant microwave cavity exist which establish the analogy near an eigenfrequency @xcite .",
    "manolache and sandu @xcite proposed a model of resonant cavity associated to an equivalent circuit consisting of an infinite set of coupled rlc oscillators .",
    "therefore , there to be a bridge between quantum billiards and the set of coupled rlc oscillators @xcite .",
    "in fact , we show here that at least , two models of electric resonance circuits ( erc ) can be proposed . in the first model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the eigen wave functions correspond correspond to voltages and eigen energies do to squared eigen frequencies of erc . in the second model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the eigen energies of quantum billiard correspond to the inverse squared eigen frequencies of the electric network .",
    "the electric network analogue systems allow to measure not only typically quantum variables such as probability and probability current distributions but also a distribution of heat power in chaotic billiards .",
    "moreover intrinsic resistances of the rlc circuit allow to model the processes of decoherence .",
    "if to map the two - dimensional schrdinger equation onto numerical grid @xmath8 one can easily obtain equation in finite element approximation @xmath9 the equivalent hamiltonian is the tight - binding one @xmath10 where vector @xmath11 runs over the nearest neighbors .    let us consider the electric resonance circuit shown in fig .",
    "each link of the two - dimensional network is given by the inductor l with the impedance @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the resistance of the inductor and @xmath14 is the frequency .",
    "each site of the network is grounded via the capacitor @xmath2 with the impedance @xmath15            the kirchoff s current law at each site of the network gives @xmath16-\\frac{1}{z_c}v_{i , j}=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 are values of voltage at the site @xmath18 .",
    "one can see that this equation coincides with the discretized version of the schrdinger equation ( [ finelem ] ) with the eigenenergies as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the eigen frequency and the linewidth of each resonance circuit .    for the second network of electric resonance circuits shown in fig .",

    "there are many ways to define the boundary conditions ( bc ) .",

    "if these sites are grounded , we obtain obviously the dirichlet bc ( [ db ] ) @xmath26 .",

    "a real electric circuit network has three features which can make a difference if to compare to the quantum billiards .",
    "these are 1 ) a discreteness of resonance circuits , 2 ) tolerance of electric elements , and 3 ) resistance of inductors . in practice",
    "the discreteness has no effect for @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a characteristic wavelength of wave function , and @xmath29 is the elementary unit of the network . numerically we consider the electric network with shape as a quarter of the bunimovich billiard .",

    "one can see distinctive deviation from the gaussian distribution which is result of multiple interference on discrete elements of the network .",
    "it is known that a noise , for example , temperature , smoothes the conduction fluctuations for transmission through quantum billiards @xcite . in present case",
    "the tolerance of circuit elements , capacity and inductance , plays role of the noise .",
    "therefore we can expect that increasing of the tolerance can suppress fluctuations of the distribution of the wave function of the discrete electric circuit network .",

    "finally we consider as a damping caused by resistance of the inductors effects the distribution of the wave function in the electric rlc resonance circuit network . in order to excite the network we apply external ac current at single site of the network .",

    "with growth of the resistance the wave function is becoming localized .",
