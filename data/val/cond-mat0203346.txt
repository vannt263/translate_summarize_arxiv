    "in  @xcite a cellular automaton model for traffic flow is proposed that is based on the nagel and schreckenberg ( nasch ) model  @xcite and that is capable to reproduce all of the empirically observed traffic states  @xcite , i.e. , free flow , wide moving jams and especially synchronized traffic ( see @xcite for recent reviews on the modeling of traffic flow ) . moreover",
    ", the accordance of the model with the empirics can be found even on a microscopic level of description . in  @xcite this degree of realism",
    "is underscored by considering a more realistic simulation setup , i.e. , a simulation of a two - lane highway segment with an onramp .",
    "empirical observations suggest  @xcite that lane changes are responsible for the occurrence of strong correlations of the velocity and flow measurements between neighboring lanes in the synchronized states and in wide moving jams . however , it was concluded  @xcite that lane changes do only select rather than generate traffic states .",
    "although the results of  @xcite do not depend on the special choice of the lane change update , the application of the model in more sophisticated topologies should be provided with realistic lane changing rules .",
    "much progress has been made in the simulation of large traffic networks like the inner - city of duisburg  @xcite , the dallas / forth - worth area  @xcite and the highway network of north - rhine - westfalia  @xcite .",
    "these simulations were based on the nasch model and use a detailed representation of the systems infrastructure like multi - lane traffic , on- and offramps and highway intersections .",
    "however , a realistic microscopic description of the dynamics of each individual vehicle in a network requires to take into account the peculiarities of the complex road structures .",
    "it is therefore necessary to formulate simple rules in the language of cellular automata which mimic the behavior of the drivers as simple as possible and yield reasonable results compared with empirical findings .",
    "unfortunately it turned out that the incorporation of two - lane traffic even in the nasch model is a formidable task and the formulation of realistic lane changing rules is very difficult .",
    "only a few empirical results for two - lane traffic exist that help to specify lane changing rules  @xcite .",
    "the ability to change lanes should increase with the density , shows a maximum in the vicinity of the flow maximum and then decreases with increasing density  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , lane changes are still possible at large densities .",
    "a special feature of german highway traffic is the empirically observed lane usage inversion .",
    "although there is a right lane preference , the distribution of the flow becomes asymmetric and the flow is larger on the left than on the right lane @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in urban traffic or on highways without the right lane constraints the traffic flow is evenly distributed on both lanes  @xcite .",
    "several two - lane extensions  @xcite of the nasch model were proposed which are able to reproduce the empirically observed lane usage inversion .",
    "however , they fail to model a realistic density dependence of the number of lane changes .",
    "moreover , it was shown that some problems of the cellular automaton approach exist if one introduces different kinds of vehicles , but these shortcomings can be minimized by the consideration of anticipation effects  @xcite .    here , we extend the recently introduced traffic model  @xcite to two - lane traffic and answer the question which mechanism gives rise to the empirically observed lane usage inversion .",
    "it is clarified that this extension can be made without changing the basic realistic properties of the single - lane model .",
    "moreover , it is demonstrated that lane changes do lead to strong correlations between neighboring lanes .",
    "the simulations are ( if not stated otherwise ) performed on a highway of length @xmath0 cells with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in addition to the local measurements of  @xcite traffic data are also recorded by averaging over the whole highway segment .",
    "this allows , in particular , to observe lane changes which can not be measured by local detectors .",
    "the averaging process , however , does not distinguish between the various traffic states on different parts of the highway  @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we briefly summarize the definition of the single - lane model and present a simple two - lane extension . because it is not possible to generate a lane usage inversion by the introduction of different kinds of cars , we present in section  [ section : asym ] an asymmetric lane changing rule set .",
    "in section  [ section : local ] we show that the vehicle dynamics of the single - lane model is not influenced by the lane - changes , but the car dynamics is determined by the single - lane update rules only .",
    "the advantages of two - lane traffic in comparison to single - lane traffic become obvious in section  [ section : comparison ] .",
    "finally , we conclude with section  [ section : conclusion ] .",
    "before we will present our lane changing rule set , we briefly define the single - lane model ( see  @xcite for a detailed explanation ) . the model used here",
    "is based on the nagel - schreckenberg cellular automaton model for traffic flow  @xcite .",
    "the road is divided into cells and a vehicle has a length of five cells .",
    "the movement of the vehicles is determined by a set of simple update rules and the system update is performed in parallel .",
    "the model of @xcite is based on the desire of the drivers for smooth and comfortable driving whereas the dynamics of the nasch model only assures the avoidance of crashes .",
    "this more sophisticated behavior is incorporated in a driving strategy which comprises three aspects : ( i ) at large distances the movement of a vehicle is determined by the maximum possible velocity .",
    "vehicles at rest have a smaller acceleration capability than moving vehicles .",
    "additionally , the velocity of the leading car is anticipated which allows for smaller gaps and larger velocities .",
    "( ii ) at intermediate distances vehicles anticipate last minute braking by means of brake lights .",
    "( iii ) at small distances the drivers adjust their velocity such that safe driving is possible .",
    ".summary of the variables and of the parameters of the model used in the model definition . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the two times @xmath1 and @xmath2 give the time a vehicle needs to reach the position of its predecessor and its predecessor on the destination lane .",
    "since the time - headways take the velocity of the vehicles into account , slow vehicles are allowed to change the lane even at small distances  ) in order to retard the change from the left to the right lane .",
    "unfortunately , this has major drawbacks since for larger densities this condition is never be fulfilled  @xcite . ] .    with the two parameters @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 it is possible to trigger the lane usage inversion .",
    "if the movement of a vehicle is undisturbed ( at small densities ) it changes the lane if its time - headway to the preceding vehicle on its own and on the destination lane is larger than @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "otherwise , at large densities the condition @xmath7 ensures an incentive to change to the right lane .",
    "figure  [ asym : fundi ] illustrates the asymmetry of the lane changing rules with the fundamental diagram : at small densities , the flow on the left lane is larger than on the right lane . as a consequence , the flow breakdown occurs first on the left lane .",
    "once the maximum flow on the left lane is reached more and more cars swerve on the right lane until the flow is distributed evenly on both lanes .",
    "therefore , the system breakdown is mainly triggered by a single - lane breakdown on the left lane  @xcite .",
    "however , the mean velocity on the right lane starts to decrease before the breakdown on the left lane occurs , so that the velocity is always larger on the left rather than on the right lane .",
    "thus , the system separates into a fast and a slow lane .",
    "the two competing mechanisms of the lane changing rules , namely the right lane overtaking ban and the right lane preference , lead to a lane usage inversion ( fig .",
    "[ asym : laneusage ] ) . at small densities",
    "the right lane preference dominates so that most of the vehicles are driving on the right lane .",
    "however , as a consequence of the right lane overtaking ban , with increasing density more vehicles avoid driving on the right lane .",
    "the position of the inversion point is mainly controlled by @xmath4 while the extent of the lane usage inversion is controlled by @xmath3 . with increasing total density",
    "the lane usage inversion decreases ( fig .",
    "[ asym : laneusage ] ) .    due to the retarded lane change from left to",
    "right the number of lane changes is decreased significantly compared to the symmetric model . like in the symmetric model ,",
    "the maximum of lane changes is reached in the vicinity of the maximum flow . further increasing the density the lane change number drops to a plateau value until lane changes are no longer possible at very large densities ( fig .",
    "[ asym : lanechangenumber ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the symmetric model , the ping - pong changes are strongly suppressed due to the asymmetric rule set .",
    "next , we consider an inhomogeneous model with @xmath8 trucks .",
    "in contrast to the symmetric model trucks are now allowed to change from the right to the left lane . in fig .",
    "[ asym : inhomo : sharenoban ] the distribution of the trucks on both lanes is depicted .",
    "although at small densities considerably more trucks are on the right than on the left lane , the trucks do not condensate completely on the right lane .",
    "therefore , the flow is dominated by trucks on both lanes even for small densities and a small fractions of trucks . as a result of the lane usage inversion and a small number of trucks on the left lane",
    ", vehicles can go faster on the right rather than on the left lane .",
    "however , at densities larger than @xmath9 the maximum velocity of the vehicles are smaller than the mean velocity so that the trucks are evenly distributed on both lanes .",
    "the stability of the plugs is mainly determined by velocity fluctuations since the distance between two trucks driving side by side in free flow can only be increased by a repeated deceleration of one truck in the randomization step of the velocity update .",
    "we therefore distributed the maximum velocity of the cars @xmath10 according to a gaussian profile with different variances and a mean @xmath11 . despite the possibility that now small differences of the maximum velocity of the trucks are allowed , the plugs remain still very robust .",
    "even different gaussian distributions of the maximum velocities of cars and trucks or special lane changing rules for trucks do not decrease the stability of the plugs .",
    "plugs are therefore no artifact of the discretization but are formed by the dynamics . because of the asymmetry of the lane changing rules , once a truck changed to the left lane , there has to be a large gap in front on the left and on the right lane to change back .",
    "this increases the time trucks are on the left lane and supports the formation of plugs .",
    "in contrast to the symmetric model , even one truck on the left lane is able to dominate the flow of the left lane completely .",
    "as long as the truck stays on the left lane passing is not possible : due to the right lane overtaking ban , like in reality , the fast cars pile up behind the truck waiting for a possibility to pass .    in order to avoid the formation of plugs we reintroduce the lane changing ban for the trucks , so that the trucks now are lane stationary on the right lane . like in the symmetric model ,",
    "the flow of the right lane is dominated by trucks only in the vicinity of @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ asym : inhomo : ban : flow ] ) which is a consequence of the increased robustness of the model regarding slow vehicles . as a result of the moving hindrances on the right lane ,",
    "the number of lane changes is increased compared to the homogeneous model ( fig .",
    "[ asym : inhomo : ban : lanechanges ] ) .",
    "now , lane changes are necessary even at very small densities to avoid being trapped behind a truck . therefore",
    ", the lane usage inversion is increased significantly in the vicinity of @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ asym : inhomo : ban : laneusage ] ) .    like in the homogeneous model the traffic breakdown",
    "is mainly controlled by the capacity of the left lane ( fig .",
    "[ asym : inhomo : breakdown ] ) . at small densities",
    "the flow on the left lane is larger than on the right lane since the density is distributed asymmetrically . further increasing the density shifts the excess flow on the right lane up to its capacity . at large densities",
    "more vehicles are on the left than on the right lane because of the lane usage inversion , which results in a larger flow on the right lane .",
    "in the last sections we focused our analysis on two - lane properties induced by lane changing maneuvers like the number of lane changes , the flow enhancement and the lane usage inversion .",
    "it turned out that it is possible to produce a realistic lane changing behavior which can reproduce empirical data already by means of a simple asymmetric rule set .",
    "nevertheless , it is an open question whether the vehicle dynamics of the single - lane model is modified by the introduction of lane changing rules .    in order to compare the two - lane model with the corresponding single - lane model",
    ", we evaluated the simulation data by a virtual inductive loop , i.e. , we measured the speed and the time - headway of the vehicles at a given link of the lattice .",
    "the density is calculated via the relation @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the mean flow and the mean velocity of cars passing the detector in a time interval of @xmath15 min .",
    "in addition to the aggregated data , the single - vehicle data of each car passing the detector are also analyzed .    a detailed analysis of the locally measured data of the homogeneous model shows no difference of the two - lane model to the single - lane model on a macroscopic ( i.e. , data averaged over an interval of @xmath15 min ) as well as on a microscopic ( i.e. , single - vehicle data ) level in the congested regime",
    "moreover , there is no difference of the locally measured data between the two - lanes in the congested regime .",
    "in contrast , in the free flow regime the time - headway distribution of the left lane shows an increased number of small headways compared to the right lane .",
    "the lane usage inversion at small densities increases the car - car interactions on the left lane which leads to clusters of cars with small gaps and large velocities . in the inhomogeneous model",
    "the inclusion of disorder dissolves these clusters so that the difference between the time - headway distributions to the single - lane model vanishes again .",
    "moreover , trucks on the right lane reduce the mean velocity in the free flow regime and shift the velocity - headway curve to smaller velocities at small distances compared to the left lane .",
    "nevertheless , these results show , that the vehicle dynamics is not influenced by the lane changing rules but by the traffic state  .",
    "empirical observations suggest a strong coupling of the lanes in the synchronized state  @xcite . in order to quantify the interaction of the lanes ,",
    "we calculated the crosscorrelation @xmath16 of the time - series of measurements of the density , the flow and the velocity on different lanes :    @xmath17    here @xmath18 denotes either the flow , the density or the velocity in lane @xmath19 .    in the free flow state the weak interaction of the lanes results in a small correlation of all quantities ( fig .",
    "[ asym : crosscorr1 ] ) .",
    "since the flow is mainly controlled by density fluctuations the density and the flow measurements show the same correlations .",
    "in contrast , at larger densities the velocity and the flow on both lanes is strongly correlated ( @xmath20 at @xmath21 ) , i.e. , indicating that the system is in the synchronized regime .",
    "however , due to the large variance of the density measurements in the synchronized regime the density on both lanes is not correlated ( fig .",
    "[ asym : crosscorr2 ] ) .",
    "lane changes are responsible for the synchronization of the velocities of different lanes @xcite . in case of a velocity difference between the lanes",
    ", vehicles are changing to the faster lanes , thus decreasing the velocity difference .",
    "this leads to a strong coupling of the lanes in the congested regime .",
    "in particular , in the vicinity of on- and offramps cars enter or leave only the right lane , but both lanes are disturbed at large in- or outflows . in order to verify this , we simulated a system with open boundary conditions and generated a jam on the right lane by a large input of an onramp .",
    "as a result , the jam spreads to the left lane , so that the time - series of the velocity measurements of both , the left and the right lane are highly correlated .",
    "moreover , the traffic breakdown occurs at the same time ( fig .",
    "[ asym : open_jam ] ) leading to a synchronization of the lanes .",
    "a detailed comparison of the single - lane model with the corresponding two - lane models shows that it is not possible to increase the flow of a two - lane model to more than twice the flow of a single - lane model by means of an asymmetric lane interaction .",
    "in contrast to symmetric models , the flow of the asymmetric model on the right lane is decreased whereas the flow on the left lane is increased compared with the single - lane model ( fig .  [ asym : fundi : compare ] ) . the right lane overtaking ban and the right lane preference lead to a suboptimal gap usage and , therefore , to a reduction of the flow on the right lane . as a result ,",
    "the mean flow per lane is smaller than the flow of a homogeneous single - lane model .",
    "however , the benefits of the two - lane model become visible if different types of cars with different maximum velocities are considered .",
    "( note , that the trucks are not allowed to change the lane . ) due to the possibility of overtaking , the system is more robust regarding disorder . while the flow of a single - lane model is dominated already by just one slow car  @xcite ( since passing",
    "is not possible ) , the flow on the right lane of the two - lane model is only decreased in the vicinity of @xmath9 compared with the homogeneous model .",
    "furthermore , the travel - time of a vehicle is reduced considerably by the lane interaction . the travel - time is measured as the time a vehicle needs to pass a given fixed link of the lattice twice .",
    "thus the travel - time on the right lane is given by vehicles that passed the measurement section on the right lane .",
    "here it is not distinguished whether the car started on the left or the right lane and lane changes during the trip through the system are allowed .",
    "compared to the single - lane model , the width of the travel - time distribution in the congested regime of the two - lane model is larger ( fig .",
    "[ asym : traveltime1 ] ) but the maximum has moved to smaller times . on one hand , vehicles which can not change the lane due to an insufficient safety gap lead to larger travel - times . on the other hand , the possibility to change the lane reduces the travel - time .",
    "moreover , the asymmetric distribution of the density leads to a smaller travel - time on the right lane than on the left lane again , the results in the congested regime are independent on the fraction of trucks since driving with maximum velocity is no longer possible .    in the free flow regime ,",
    "the inclusion of trucks on the right lane is responsible for a larger mean travel - time compared with the homogeneous two - lane model ( fig .",
    "[ asym : traveltime2 ] ) .",
    "the trucks on the right lane enforce clustering so that the travel - time of cars trapped behind a truck increases which leads to a second small peak at large times in the travel - time distribution .",
    "therefore , the more trucks are in the system , the larger is the variance of the travel - time distribution .",
    "we have presented an asymmetric two - lane model with a simple and local lane changing rule set that shows the empirically observed lane usage inversion and reproduces the density dependence of the number of lane changes . in order to observe lane usage inversion",
    "it is not sufficient to implement asymmetry into the model by means of disorder , i.e. , different types of cars .",
    "moreover , the introduction of the right lane overtaking ban or the right lane preference alone fails to reproduce the lane usage inversion , too .",
    "thus , realistic behavior is only obtained by incorporating both a right lane preference and a right lane overtaking ban simultaneously into the model s rules .",
    "the benefits of the two - lane model compared with the single - lane model become visible by introducing disorder : there is no flow enhancement of the two - lane model with one type of cars , but the robustness of the flow regarding slow vehicles can be increased significantly by means of lane interaction .",
    "this lane interaction leads to a strong coupling of both lanes in the synchronized regime , which results in strong correlations of the time - series of the velocity .    as a consequence",
    ", a jam generated on the right lane by an onramp can branch to the left lane leading to a congested region on both lanes . in order to improve and optimize the throughput of the highway it is possible to use ramp metering systems  @xcite . here",
    ", such systems will help to reduce perturbations of the right lane and , thus , stabilize the flow even on the left lane .",
    "finally , a detailed analysis of local measurements shows that the car dynamics remains unchanged by the introduction of the lane changing rules .",
    "therefore , the lane change extension of the single - lane model can be used for the propagation of traffic state information to all lanes , e.g. , in order to synchronize the lanes , or to trigger distinct traffic states ( e.g. , in the vicinity of on- and offramps ) . moreover",
    ", the independence of the velocity update and the lane change update allows for further improvements of the car dynamics and/or developments of more sophisticated lane changing rules ( e.g. , for bottlenecks ) .    *",
