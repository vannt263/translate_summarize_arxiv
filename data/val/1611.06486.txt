    "the poisson - nernst - planck ( pnp ) theory , which is composed of the nernst - planck equations for the ionic flux under the concentration gradient and electrical field , and the poisson equation for the electrical potential , is a classical continuum model to describe the ionic transport in solution .",
    "though the pnp is a mean - field theory , it is beyond the poisson - boltzmann theory because it allows us to calculate the current under external fields .",
    "it has been shown to be successful in lots of applications including nanofluidics and microfluidics @xcite , semi - conductor devices @xcite and transmembrane ion channels @xcite .",
    "the traditional pnp model can not make correct prediction for systems with divalent ions or with a dielectric boundary because it treats ions as point charges without short - range size effect and ignores the long - range coulomb correlation .",
    "the improvement of the mean - field approximation has attracted wide attention in recent decades @xcite .",
    "the steric effect between particles can be considered by introducing the excess free energy functional given by solvent entropy @xcite , lennard - jones kernel @xcite or modified fundamental measure theory @xcite . for the coulomb correlation which is long - range , we can in general",
    "introduces a self - energy correction to the mean potential as the excess chemical potential which is in spirit similar to the born solvation energy or the image - charge energy .",
    "a considerable routine is by the generalized debye - hckel equation from the field theory , which can be derived under the point - charge assumption ( pca ) by the debye closure of the bbgky hierarchy @xcite , or the gaussian variational field theory @xcite for equilibrium systems .",
    "the pdes under the pca are unstable @xcite for strong - coupling systems because cations and anions may collapse when the interaction is strong . to go beyond pca , wang @xcite used the variational field theory to derive a generalized debye - hckel equation for ions with gaussian charge distribution , which first reveals the importance of the ionic self energy for mobile ions with finite size and variable dielectric media and builds the theoretical framework for accounting for these effects .",
    "the extension from equilibrium to time - dependent dynamics with the fick s law is straightforward , and results in the modified pnp equations .    in this work ,",
    "we derive the system free energy through the debye charging process@xcite , which accounts for the coulomb correlation of ions with finite size and the dielectric effect .",
    "the self energy is described by the generalized debye - hckel equation with variable coefficients .",
    "when finite ion size is considered , the numerical solution of the generalized debye - hckel equation is challenging .",
    "first of all , the equation is high dimension with symmetry breaking , e.g. 6-dimension for real 3-dimension systems .",
    "also the inclusion of the excluded - volume effect leads to a multi - scale problem , i.e. , the scales at the ionic size and the debye screening length .",
    "we propose the asymptotic expansions of the self energy by taking the ionic size as a small parameter , which express the self energy by the self - green s function solution of the point charge generalized debye - hckel equation . with the asymptotic self - energy expression",
    ", we find the connection between the chemical potential and self - energy , so that the modified pnp equation can have s simple form and satisfy a proper energy law .",
    "we compare the results of different kind of approximations , and demonstrate the new formulations can predict correct physics.these topics will be discussed in section 2",
    ".    on the other hand , numerical solutions of the pnp and the modified pnp equations can be very challenging , and have attracted much interest recently @xcite .",

    "we perform numerical example to show that the method can capture the physical features as well as the necessity of including the coulomb correlation in the model .",
    "to take into account the correlation contribution in the framework of the pnp , we will start from the free energy formulation .",
    "the modified pnp equations are derived through the energetic variation approach @xcite such that the energy law will be automatically fulfilled . the so - called debye charging process considers a hypothetical process , in which all ions are charged with the same rate from zero charge to its full charge .",
    "the work done during the process is equal to the free energy difference and thus can be used to calculate ionic chemical potential or activity coefficients @xcite . and",
    "later , gntelberg @xcite proposed another charging process where only one central ion goes through the hypothetical charging , while other ions are fully charged .",

    "the second integral considers the coulomb correlation and the dielectric effect , is our modification to the classical mean field theory .",
    "the self energy is treated at the debye - hckel level , which means only the test ion is considered with finite radius while the surrounding mobile ions are still treated as point charges .",
    "let @xmath33 be the spherical domain of a test ion located at @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the indicator function of its complementary set @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath37 for @xmath38 and 1 elsewhere .",
    "assume adding an hard sphere at location @xmath39 will not change the surrounding ionic distribution except the interior domain of the ion sphere is inaccessible , i.e. the short - range hard core correlation is ignored .",

    "significant differences near the cathode are observed , where the mean - field pnp largely underestimates the amount of the counterions .",
    "this is understandable because the correlation energy is favorable to the counterion condensation @xcite and the neglect of correlation energy naturally reduces the counterion density near the surface .",
    "oppositely , the use of the pca strongly overestimates the correlation energy .",
    "this ascribes to the lack of excluded - volume effect in the pca , leading to unphysical enhancement of the coulomb correlation .",
    "the depletion zone near the interface is due to the dielectric - boundary effect @xcite which has been ignored by the mean - field pnp equations .        in order to investigate the dynamic property of the mean - field pnp and modified pnps , figure [ diffusion ]",
    "shows the total diffusion charge , @xmath238 as function of time @xmath236 , which describes the charges moving from the right half to the left due to the voltage bias on the boundaries .",
    "it can be observed that when @xmath236 is small ( @xmath239 ) , the dynamics of all the four models are almost the same as this is the period that an electrical double layer structure is formed to screen the surface potential .",
    "the mean - field pnp tends to the equilibrium state after this period .",
    "however , the modified pnps predict more diffusion charge which mobiles to the opposite half with a slower dynamics .",
    "this is again due to the coulomb correlation between ions .",
    "we can see that the pca has the largest amount of diffusion charge , slightly bigger than those from the first- and second - order asymptotics .",
    "it should be noted that from the diffusion charge curves , we can not observe much difference between the pca and the higher - order asymptotics .",
    "however , if we increase the boundary voltage or consider electrolytes with multivalent ions , the modified pnp with the pca could lead to blow up solutions @xcite and fail to predict the ion transport , and we should use a model with the ion - size effect to remedy this instability .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed modified pnp model with contribution from coulomb correlation where the excluded volume of ions is taken into account .",
    "we start from the free energy functional where asymptotic approximations for the correlation energy with the ionic size as a small parameter are discussed .",
    "the modified pnp equations are then resulted by the variation with the approximate energy functional . by numerical example",
    ", we demonstrate the new model is useful in predicting the ion structure and dynamics near interfaces when the coulomb correlation plays role in the application systems .",
