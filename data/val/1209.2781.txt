    "it is well known that the toplogy of the network changes the dynamics dramatically . after the discovery of the absence of epidemic threshold in a scale - free network@xcite",
    ", many researchers have focused on the dynamics on complex network , such as synchronization @xcite , pattern formation@xcite , and other phenomena .    in this paper , we study the bouchaud - mzard ( bm ) model on complex network@xcite .",
    "the power - law behavior of wealth distribution , pareto s distribution , has for over a century been one of the main cornerstones of econophysics@xcite .",
    "one of the simplest models that explain this law is that proposed by bouchaud and mzard , which consists of multiplicative noise and globally coupled diffusion . after the proposal of the bm model , several researchers numerically investigated the generalized bm model in which diffusion occurs between adjacent nodes in a complex network@xcite .",
    "while , the research revealed that the network topology alters the wealth distribution , there has been no quantitative theory that sufficiently explains these simulation results .",
    "recently , we proposed a new theory for the bm model on a random network@xcite .",
    "using several assumptions that we describe in the next section , we derived equations that determine the static probability density function ( pdf ) of the wealth .",
    "the results of this analysis were compared with those of the numerical simulations and good agreement was obtained .",
    "however , the wealth distributions were analyzed only on a random network in the previous paper , and the distributions on other complex networks was left as an open problem .",
    "the aim of this paper is develop our previous work so that it is applicable to a general complex network .",
    "using the same techniques applied in the previous paper , we derive the equations that determine the static pdf for the bm model on a complex network for a given adjacency matrix .",
    "the results are evaluated by a comparison with the numerical simulation results , and our method is revealed to perform well for many network systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] , we derive the self - consistent equations that determine the pdf of the bm model on a complex network whose adjacency matrix is given .",
    "the results obtained with this pdf are tested in sec .",
    "[ simulation ] by comparing with simulations on several networks such as a random network , the watts  strogatz ( ws ) network , and a real social network .",
    "finally , we discuss the results and future problems and summarize the paper in sec . iv .",
    "we consider the bm model on a undirected complex network consisting of @xmath0 nodes , whose adjacency matrix is given by @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath2 , i.e. , the wealth on node @xmath3 , are determined by the following ito - type stochastic differential equations .",
    "@xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 represents the diffusion constant of wealth , strength of noise , and the standard brownian motion , respectively .",
    "this equation has no static pdf ; however , the normalized wealth @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents an average over all nodes , can have a static pdf .",
    "for simplicity , @xmath10 is used in place of @xmath11 in the following discussion .    to obtain a static @xmath2 distribution",
    ", we make the `` adiabatic and independent '' approximation introduced in our previous paper@xcite .",
    "we first assume that all @xmath2 values are independent and that the correlation between different nodes is negligible . under this assumption ,",
    "we assume the pdf can be decomposed as @xmath12 .",
    "second , we assume that the rate of change of @xmath13 , the average @xmath10 around node @xmath3 , is much slower than that of @xmath2 , where @xmath14 represents the degree of node @xmath3 . using these assumptions , we can calculate the static pdf as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath15 is constant .",
    "then @xmath16 , the conditional pdf of @xmath10 on node @xmath3 for a given @xmath15 , is a solution of the following fokker ",

    "@xmath17 + \\sigma^2 \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2 }    [ x^2 \\rho_i]\\;.\\ ] ]    the static solution of this equation , @xmath18 , is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "using the adiabatic assumption , the static pdf of @xmath10 at node @xmath3 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the pdf of @xmath24 .    to obtain @xmath23",
    ", we use the independent assumption again together with the central - limit theorem . under this assumption",
    ", @xmath23 can be assumed to be the distribution of the average of the independent variables @xmath25 , where @xmath26 represents a node adjacent to node @xmath3 .",
    "if the variances of @xmath25 are finite for all @xmath26 , we can apply the central - limit theorem to approximate @xmath27 by the gaussian distribution @xmath28\\;,\\label{091257_8aug12}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent the average and variance of @xmath31 , respectively . from lindeberg s theorem ,",
    "these values are given by @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the average and variance of @xmath25 , respectively .",

    "we thus obtain @xmath44 for all @xmath3 , and @xmath45 is the solution of @xmath46 using eq .",
    "( [ 090021_8aug12 ] ) , we can rewrite this equation as @xmath47 for convenience and in anticipation for later analysis , we define a new matrix @xmath48 as @xmath49 we then finally obtain the following equation for @xmath37 : @xmath50 eqs .",

( [ eqfors ] ) must have a solution @xmath52 to have any meaningful result .",
    "if @xmath5 is large enough , this condition is satisfied provided that @xmath53 . for a @xmath5 value that satisfies @xmath54 for all @xmath3",
    ", @xmath55 is a non - negative matrix .",

    "( [ eqfors ] ) satisfies @xmath56 if @xmath57 , where @xmath58 represents the spectral radius of @xmath59 . from frobenius s theorem , @xmath58 is equal to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath59 , and thus we conclude that eq .",
    "( [ eqfors ] ) has a meaningful solution if the largest eigenvalue of @xmath59 is less than 1 .",
    "noting that @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for @xmath63 , @xmath58 is less than 1 for large @xmath5 , and a non - condensed phase appears , provided that @xmath64 .",
    "in contrast , we always have a condensed phase at small @xmath5 due to the divergence of the @xmath65 elements .",
    "as we decrease @xmath5 from a large value , the @xmath65 values increase and diverge when @xmath66 ; @xmath58 also diverges in this case .",
    "therefore , the wealth is condensed if @xmath67 .",
    "to test our theory , we compare the results with numerical simulation results on several networks .",
    "we begin with the network created by the erds - rnyi algorithm and then consider several networks created by the ws model@xcite to test the effect of clustering .",
    "it is shown that our theory fails when the rewiring rate @xmath68 is too small , but good agreement is obtained when @xmath69 . finally , we test our theory on a real network",
    ". it would be ideal to apply the theory to a real economic network , but as there is currently no available data , we use the american college football network obtained by girvan and newman@xcite instead . for this case , the pdf obtained from the simulations shows good agreement with our theory .",
    "for all the simulations , @xmath70 is set to 1 .",
    "the network created by the erds - rnyi algorithm , shown in fig .",
    "[ 140327_24aug12 ] , has 200 nodes and a mean degree of @xmath71 .    in fig .",
    "[ 170117_22aug12 ] we plot the pdfs obtained by numerical simulation for @xmath72 , and 2.0 .",
    "the pdfs obtained using our theory are indicated by the solid line and show good agreement with the numerical simulation for all @xmath10 for the @xmath73 case , but there are minor discrepancies at small @xmath10 values in the cases of @xmath74 and 0.5 .",
    "the discrepancy is due to the @xmath75 assumption used for deriving eqs .",
    "( [ 170529_22aug12 ] ) and ( [ 170556_22aug12 ] ) . the maximum @xmath45 value calculated by eqs .",
    "( [ eqfors ] ) and ( [ 133408_24aug12 ] ) is 0.33 for @xmath74 and 0.09 for @xmath76 , while @xmath77 .",
    "thus , the @xmath78 approximation is not valid as @xmath79 is larger than 0.3 .",
    "however , the approximation is valid for the @xmath73 case as the maximum @xmath45 value is 0.01 .",
    "next , we consider three networks created by the ws algorithm .",
    "the networks have @xmath80 nodes and a mean degree of @xmath81 with different rewiring rates of @xmath82 , and 0.2 .",
    "[ 155309_15aug12 ] shows both the networks and pdfs . in the case of @xmath83 ,",
    "our theory differs from the numerical simulation , while we find good agreement for the @xmath84 and @xmath85 cases .",
    "+    to investigate the reason for this discrepancy , we examine the scatter plots of @xmath10 and @xmath86 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 in fig .",
    "[ scatterplot ] . for @xmath83",
    ", we find that there is a strong correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath86 that weakens for @xmath84 .",
    "the differences can be quantified by the correlation , which is 0.74 for @xmath83 and 0.48 for @xmath84 .",
    "this result suggests that the discrepancy is caused by the breakdown of independent assumption .",
    "it is reasonable to question here when and why the independent assumption fails .",
    "the small - world property does not appear to affect the independence of wealth because the networks show high - clustering and small betweenness for both the @xmath83 and 0.1 cases .",
    "we return to this point in the discussion section .",
    "the american college football network obtained by girvan and newman@xcite includes 115 nodes and 613 edges .",
    "the simulated pdfs for @xmath74 and 0.5 are shown in fig .",
    "[ 093508_20aug12 ] . in both cases ,",
    "our theory reproduces the pdf well .",
    "the agreement between theory and simulation seems excellent .",
    "we have not understand the reason for this good agreement , however , one possible reason is that this network has community structure . as girvan and newman showed , this network has clear communities . as we will see in the later section ,",
    "the spatial correlation of wealth would be small for globally coupled network .",
    "therefore it is natural to assume that wealth correlation is also small , if the network is consisted from several densely connected subgraphs .",
    "however , we still need further study to explain this excellent agreement .",
    "here , we have developed a theory for the bm model on complex networks . by generalizing our previous work",
    ", we were able to propose a theory applicable to a complex network with a given adjacency matrix . using the adiabatic and independent assumptions",
    ", we derived the equations that determine the static pdf of the wealth .",
    "the result was compared to numerical simulations , and we found our theory works well on a erds - rnyi network , ws networks with @xmath87 , and the american college football network .",
    "we also found that the theory did not perform well for a ws network with @xmath88 as the independent assumption is no longer valid .",
    "the theory does not apply to a ws network with a small @xmath68 value because of the large spatial correlation in this case .",
    "thus , we may ask when and why the spatial correlation becomes large . while it is difficult to give a complete answer to this question",
    ", the following discussion suggests that the properties of the laplacian are essential to this problem .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 is very large and the fluctuations of @xmath10 are very small .",
    "under such circumstances , we can approximate @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ 083834_8aug12 ] ) as @xmath90 and obtain @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the laplacian matrix @xmath93 . to investigate the correlation in this toy model ,",
    "we assume for simplicity that the network is undirected and connected .",
    "introducing the eigenvalues and corresponding normalized eigenvectors of @xmath94 as @xmath95 and @xmath96 , we can write @xmath97",
    ". then @xmath94 is diagonalized and eq .",
    "( [ 150804_20aug12 ] ) can be written as @xmath98 the static distribution of @xmath99 is calculated as @xmath100\\;.\\label{133706_28aug12}\\ ] ] the @xmath101 term does not have a static distribution because @xmath102 . however , because @xmath103 , this term gives the uniform change , @xmath104 , and does not contribute to the correlation .    from eq .",
    "( [ 133706_28aug12 ] ) and the relation @xmath105 , we obtain the covariance @xmath106 our independent assumption implies that the off - diagonal elements of eq .",
    "( [ 145452_24aug12 ] ) are smaller than the diagonal elements .",
    "this condition is satisfied if every @xmath107 is `` localized '' , in other words , has only one large components .",
    "it has been shown by some researchers that eigenvectors is localized in many complex networks @xcite .",
    "our theory will be applicable to these network models .",
    "we also consider here the case for which the adiabatic assumption is not valid .",
    "if the node degree is large enough , then @xmath108 changes at a much slower rate than that of @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , this assumption will be valid if the degree of each node is large .",
    "on the other hand , if the degree of each node is small , then not only the adiabatic assumption but also the use of the central - limit theorem can not be justified .",
    "for example , our theory will not work well for the `` star''-network in which almost all nodes have a degree of 1 .",
    "we note that theory for the bm model in the wealth - condensed phase is still elusive , as the standard central - limit theory is not applicable when @xmath109 diverges .",
    "thus , to discuss the static properties , we will need to generalize the central - limit theorem so that it can be adopted even if the variance diverges .",
    "finally , we note that our developed technique is applicable to other dynamical systems subject to noise .",
    "stochastic dynamics on complex network is attracting the interests of many reserchers recently , however , dynamics with multiplicative noise has not studied so far .",
    "we believe this method will shed new light on other problems regarding the dynamics on complex networks .",
