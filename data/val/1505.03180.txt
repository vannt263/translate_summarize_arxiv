    "<S> a dielectric drop suspended in conducting liquid and subjected to an uniform electric field deforms into an ellipsoid whose major axis is either perpendicular or tilted ( due to quincke rotation effect ) relative to the applied field . </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally study the effect of surface - adsorbed colloidal particles on these classic electrohydrodynamic phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that at high surface coverage ( @xmath0 ) , the electrohydrodynamic flow is suppressed , oblate drop deformation is enhanced , and the threshold for tilt is decreased compared to the particle  free drop . </S>",

    "<S> the reduction of the threshold field for rotation is likely related to drop asphericity . </S>"
