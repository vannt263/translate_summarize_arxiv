    "the search for a quantum theory encompassing gravity has been a major issue in theoretical physics for the last 60 years . nonetheless , until recently quantum gravity was largely relegated to the realm of speculation due to the complete lack of observational or experimental tests .",
    "in fact the traditional scale of quantum gravitational effects , the planck scale @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 , is completely out of reach for any experiment or observation currently at hand .",
    "this state of affairs had led the scientific community to adopt the `` folklore '' that testing quantum gravity was completely impossible .",
    "however the last decade has seen a dramatic change in this respect , and nowadays one can encounter a growing literature dealing with tests of possible predictions of various quantum gravity models  @xcite .",
    "this field goes generically under the name of  quantum gravity phenomenology \" .    among the several generic predictions associated with quantum gravity models ,",
    "the possibility that planck - scale physics might induce violations of lorentz invariance has played a particularly important role  @xcite .",
    "generically any possible `` discreteness '' or `` granularity '' of spacetime at the planck scale seems incompatible with strict lorentz invariance ( although some particular quantum gravity theories might still preserve it , see e.g.  @xcite ) since larger and larger boosts expose shorter and shorter distances .",
    "actually we now have a wealth of theoretical studies  for example in the context of string field theory  @xcite , spacetime foam scenarios  @xcite , semiclassical calculations in loop quantum gravity  @xcite , deformed special relativity models  @xcite , or non - commutative geometry  @xcite , just to cite a few  all leading to high - energy violations of lorentz invariance .",
    "interestingly most investigations , even if they arise from quite different fundamental physics , seem to converge on the prediction that the breakdown of lorentz invariance generically becomes manifest in the form of modified dispersion relations exhibiting extra energy - dependent or momentum - dependent terms , apart from the usual quadratic one occurring in the lorentz invariant dispersion relation : @xmath2 in the absence of a definitive theory of quantum gravity it became common to adopt , in most of the literature seeking to put these predictions to observational test , a purely phenomenological approach , ,  one that modifies the dispersion relation by adding some generic momentum - dependent ( or energy - dependent ) function @xmath3 to be expanded in powers of the dimensionless quantity @xmath4 .",
    "hence the ansatz reads : @xmath5 where the @xmath6 are chosen to be dimensionless .",
    "since these dispersion relations are not lorentz invariant , it is necessary to specify the particular inertial frame in which they are given , and generally one chooses the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) frame . of course compatibility with low - energy experiments",
    "implies that somehow the @xmath7 and @xmath8 coefficients must be extremely small ( and indeed very stringent constraints on these two terms have been obtained , _",
    "e.g. _ , within the framework of the so called standard model extension  @xcite ) .",
    "hence most of the attention in the recent years have been focussed on the higher - order ( explicitly planck suppressed ) @xmath9 lorentz violating terms in eq  ( [ eq : mod - disp ] ) .    at first sight",
    "it might appear hopeless to constrain such deviations from exact lorentz invariance without exploring planckian regimes .",
    "however a more careful analysis shows that no ultra high energies are needed for such a task ( at least for powers with @xmath10 ) .",
    "the basic idea is that there are some special phenomena where the tiny violations like those present in eq  ( [ eq : mod - disp ] ) can be amplified by suitable physical effects .",
    "let us give a simple example by considering a dispersion relation like  ( [ eq : mod - disp ] ) but with only one lorentz - violating term suppressed by some power of @xmath4 : @xmath11 if we now consider a threshold reaction involving the creation of such a particle it is easy to see that it will _ not _ be necessary to require the lorentz - violating term to be comparable to the @xmath12 term in order to have a detectable effect . indeed the threshold scale will be fixed by the mass scale @xmath13 and the modification should be expected to become important when the first and last term on the l.h.s .  of eq  ( [ eq : ex - disp ] ) are comparable .",
    "it is east to see that , assuming @xmath14 , this happens when @xmath15^{1/n}\\ ] ] which indeed , for @xmath10 , corresponds to energy scales not totally beyond reach in high energy astrophysics .",
    "for example the above equation for @xmath16 implies that one can cast a constraint of order one on the dimensionless coefficient @xmath17 for , say , an electron , by looking at a threshold reaction involving such particles with energies of about 10 tev .",
    "indeed threshold reactions are not the only phenomena accessible to current observations / experiments which are sensitive to possible violations of lorentz invariance .",
    "a partial list is :    * dynamical effects of lv background fields ( _ e.g. _  gravitational coupling and additional gravitational wave modes ) ; * sidereal variation of lv couplings as the lab moves with respect to a preferred frame or directions , or cosmological variation ; * long baseline dispersion and vacuum birefringence ( _ e.g. _  of signals from gamma ray bursts , active galactic nuclei , pulsars , galaxies ) ; * new reaction thresholds ( _ e.g. _  photon decay , vacuum cherenkov effect ) ; * shifted thresholds ( _ e.g. _  photon annihilation from blazars or gzk reaction _",
    "pion production by collision of ultra high energy protons with cmb photons ) ; * maximum velocity ( _ e.g. _  synchrotron peak from supernova remnants ) .",
    "of course merely specifying a set of dispersion relations is not always enough to place significant constraints on the model  as most observations need at least some assumption on the dynamics for their interpretation . in fact",
    "most of the available constraints are extracted from some assumed model  test theory \" .",
    "although several alternative scenarios have been considered in the literature , so far the most commonly explored avenue is an effective field theory ( eft ) approach ( see ,  @xcite for a review focussed on this framework , and  @xcite for some of the primary literature ) .",
    "the main reasons for this choice can be summarized in the fact that we are very familiar with this class of theories , and that it is a widely accepted idea ( although not unanimously accepted , see  @xcite ) that _ any _ quantum gravity scenario should admit a suitable eft description at low energies .",
    "all in all , the standard model and general relativity itself , ( which are presumably not fundamental theories ) are efts , as are most models of condensed - matter systems at appropriate length and energy scales .",
    "even `` fundamental '' quantum gravity candidates such as string theory admit an eft description at low energies ( as perhaps most impressively verified in the calculations of black hole entropy and hawking radiation rates ) .",
    "the eft approach to the study of lorentz violations has been remarkably useful in the last few years . nowadays",
    "the best studied theories incorporating lorentz violations are efts where lorentz violations are associated either with renormalizable lorentz - violating operators ( mass dimension four or less ) , or sometimes with higher - order lorentz - violating operators ( mass dimension 5 or greater , corresponding to order @xmath18 and @xmath12 deviations in the dispersion relation  ( [ eq : mod - disp ] ) ) . the first approach is generally known as the standard model extension  @xcite , while the second has been formalized by myers and pospelov  @xcite in the form of qed with dimension five lorentz - violating operators ( order @xmath19 deviations in the dispersion relation of eq  ( [ eq : mod - disp ] ) . in both cases extremely accurate constraints have been obtained using a combination of experiments as well as observation ( mainly in high energy astrophysics ) .",
    "let us focus for the moment on the second case , _",
    "i.e. _ on an ansatz in which one presumes that the coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 are absent or extremely small ( as lorentz invariance is very well tested at low energies ) , while the first relevant lorentz - violating term is associated with a cubic power of the momentum .",
    "we shall first briefly review the main constraints obtained so far in this framework and later discuss some open issues which we shall finally try to address with a condensed matter analogue model .",
    "as discussed above , the study of lorentz - violating eft in the higher mass dimension sector was initiated by myers and pospelov  @xcite .",
    "they classified all lv dimension - five operators that can be added to the qed lagrangian and are quadratic in the same fields , rotation invariant , gauge invariant , not reducible to a combination of lower and/or higher dimension operators using the field equations , and contribute @xmath19 terms to the dispersion relation .    in the limit of high energy @xmath21 ,",
    "the photon and electron dispersion relations following from qed with the above terms are  @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 are dimensionless parameters ( and @xmath24 ) .",
    "the photon subscripts @xmath25 refer to helicity , _",
    "i.e. _ right and left circular polarization , which it turns out necessarily have opposite lv parameters .",
    "the electron subscripts @xmath25 also refer to the helicity , which can be shown to be a good quantum number in the presence of these lv terms  @xcite .",
    "moreover , if we write @xmath26 for the lv parameters of the two electron helicities , those for positrons are given  @xcite by @xmath27      we now provide a partial and brief list of the current best constraints on extended qed with dimension 5 lorentz violations .",
    "the main aim of such a partial overview is simply to provide us with quantitative insight about the current strength of the constraints and how they are obtained . for details",
    ", we direct the reader to the much more extensive accounts of these constraints currently available in the literature ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "[ [ photon - time - of - flight ] ] photon time of flight : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    photon time of flight constraints  @xcite limit differences in the arrival time on earth for photons originating in a distant event  @xcite .",
    "time of flight can vary with energy since the lv term in the group velocity is @xmath28 .",
    "the arrival time difference for wave - vectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 is thus @xmath31 which is proportional to the energy difference and the distance travelled .",
    "constraints were obtained using the high energy radiation emitted by some gamma ray bursts ( grb ) and active galaxies of the blazar class .",
    "the strength of such constraints is typically @xmath32 or weaker  @xcite .",
    "[ [ vacuum - birefringence ] ] vacuum birefringence : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    looking at eq  ( [ qeddisp ] ) one sees that the parameters for the lorentz violation for left and right circular polarized photons are equal and opposite .",
    "this implies that the phase velocity thus depends on both the wavevector and the helicity .",
    "linear polarization is therefore rotated through an energy - dependent angle as a signal propagates , which depolarizes an initially linearly polarized signal comprised of a range of wavevectors .",
    "hence the observation of linearly polarized radiation coming from far away can constrain the magnitude of the lv parameter .",
    "unfortunately we do not have at the moment reliable observations of polarized photon fluxes at very high energy .",
    "it is however remarkable that the most reliable constraint on the dimension five term was deduced by gleiser and kozameh  @xcite using uv light from distant galaxies , and is given by @xmath33 .",
    "[ [ threshold - effects ] ] threshold effects : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    there are several threshold effects that can be influenced by the presence of additional , lorentz violating , terms like those in eq  ( [ qeddisp ] ) . in general we can distinguish three kinds of threshold reactions :    1 .",
    "threshold reactions which are normally forbidden , but are allowed if lorentz invariance is broken .",
    "threshold reactions which are normally allowed , but are sufficiently high - energy that their thresholds are non - negligibly shifted in the presence of planck - suppressed lorentz violations .",
    "finally there are reactions which become allowed due to lorentz violations but do not strictly speaking have a threshold energy , though they do have a very suppressed reaction rate .",
    "these reactions can be said to have an `` effective threshold energy '' above which the rate is non - negligible .    regarding the extended qed of eq  ( [ qeddisp ] ) , the first category includes two reactions associated with the basic qed vertex , _",
    "i.e. _  photon decay , @xmath34 and vacuum cherekov @xmath35 .",
    "a general property of these reactions is that above threshold they have a very rapid rate so that the particle under consideration would effectively be unable to propagate .",
    "the second category instead includes the very important astrophysical reaction of gamma pair creation , @xmath36 , where a tev - scale gamma ray annihilates with a ( ir or cmb ) background photon to create a electron - positron pair .",
    "finally , the third category includes reactions like photon splitting , @xmath37 , helicity decay , @xmath35 , or electron pair creation , @xmath38 .",
    "( see @xcite for a detailed discussion . )",
    "threshold analyses have been very effective tools in constraining the modified dispersion relations ( [ qeddisp ] ) .",
    "in particular the best constraint up to date on @xmath39 on the coefficients for the electron / positron comes from the detection of 50 tev inverse compton gamma rays from the crab nebula ( which implies absence of photon decay up to this energies ) .",
    "[ [ synchrotron - radiation ] ] synchrotron radiation : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the crab nebula also provides another interesting mechanism for constraining the dispersion relations ( [ qeddisp ] ) .",
    "we do in fact detect a characteristic synchrotron emission from the crab nebula , which can be used to cast a strong constraint on at least one of the @xmath40 coefficients .",
    "indeed an electron or positron with a negative value of @xmath40 has a maximal group velocity less than the low - energy speed of light .",
    "this implies an upper bound on the relativistic gamma factor for such a lepton , which in turn implies  @xcite the presence of a maximal synchrotron frequency @xmath41 that such a lepton will be able to produce , regardless of its energy , in a given magnetic field @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "thus for at least one electron or positron helicity @xmath41 must be greater than the maximum observed synchrotron emission frequency @xmath43 .",
    "this yields the constraint @xmath44 the strongest constraint is obtained in the case of a system that has the smallest @xmath45 ratio .",
    "this occurs exactly in the crab nebula , which emits synchrotron radiation up to 100 mev and has a magnetic field no larger than 0.6 mg in the emitting region .",
    "thus one can infer that at least one of @xmath46 must be greater than @xmath47 .",
    "( actually , to obtain a useful constraint this analysis must be complemented with a study of the inverse compton peak  for further details , see  @xcite . )",
    "in spite of the remarkable success in constraining the modified qed of eq  ( [ qeddisp ] ) it is interesting to note that there are still significant open issues concerning its theoretical foundations . in particular ,",
    "let us now focus on two aspects of this approach that have spurred some debate among members of the quantum gravity phenomenology community .",
    "[ [ the - naturalness - problem ] ] the naturalness problem : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    looking at the dispersion relation ( [ eq : mod - disp ] ) it might seem that the deviations linear and quadratic in @xmath18 are _ not _ planck suppressed , and hence are always dominant ( and grossly incompatible with observations ) .",
    "however one might hope that there will be some other characteristic qft mass scale @xmath48 ( , some particle physics mass scale ) associated with the lorentz symmetry breaking which might enter in the lowest order dimensionless coefficients @xmath49 , which will be then generically suppressed by appropriate ratios of this characteristic mass to the planck mass .",
    "following the observational leads one might then assume behaviours like @xmath50 , and @xmath51 where @xmath52 is some positive power ( often taken as one or two ) .",
    "meanwhile no extra planck suppression is assumed for the higher order @xmath6 coefficients , which are then naturally of order one .",
    "note that such an ansatz assures that the lorentz - violating term linear in the particle momentum in eq  ( [ eq : mod - disp ] ) is always subdominant with respect to the quadratic one , and that the lorentz - violating term cubic in the momentum is the least suppressed of the higher - order ones .",
    "if this is the case one will have two distinct regimes : for low momenta @xmath53 the lower - order ( quadratic in the momentum ) deviations in  ( [ eq : mod - disp ] ) will dominate over the higher - order ( cubic and higher ) ones , while at high energies @xmath54 the higher - order terms ( cubic and above in the momentum ) will be dominant .",
    "the naturalness problem arises because such a line of reasoning does not seem to be well justified within an eft framework .",
    "in fact we implicitly assumed that there are no extra planck suppressions hidden in the dimensionless coefficients @xmath6 with @xmath9 .",
    "indeed we can not justify why _ only _ the dimensionless coefficients of the @xmath55 terms should be suppressed by powers of the small ratio @xmath56 .",
    "even worse , renormalization group arguments seem to imply that a similar mass ratio , @xmath56 would implicitly be present in _ all _ the dimensionless @xmath57 coefficients  hence suppressing them even further , to the point of complete undetectability . furthermore it is easy to show  @xcite that , without some protecting symmetry , it is generic that radiative corrections due to particle interactions in an eft with only lorentz violations of order @xmath9 in ( [ eq : mod - disp ] ) for the free particles , will generate @xmath58 and @xmath59 lorentz violating terms in the dispersion relation , which will then be dominant .",
    "[ [ the - universality - issue ] ] the universality issue : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the second point is not so much a problem , as an issue of debate as to the best strategy to adopt . in dealing with situations with multiple particles",
    "one has to choose between the case of universal ( particle - independent ) lorentz violating coefficients @xmath6 , or instead go for a more general ansatz and allow for particle - dependent coefficients ; hence allowing different magnitudes of lorentz symmetry violation for different particles even when considering the same order terms ( same @xmath60 ) in the momentum expansion .",
    "the two choices are equally represented in the extant literature ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite and @xcite for the two alternative anstze ) , but it would be interesting to understand how generic this universality might be , and what sort of processes might induce non - universal lorentz violation for different particles .",
    "20 pt    to shed some light on these issues it would definitely be useful to have something that can play the role of test - bed for some of the ideas related to the emergence and form of the modified dispersion relations of eq  ( [ eq : mod - disp ] ) . in this regard , herein we will consider an analogue model of spacetime , that is , a condensed - matter system which admits excitations whose propagation mimics that of quantum fields on a curved spacetime  @xcite .",
    "indeed it is well known that the discreteness at small scales of such systems shows up exactly via modified dispersion relations of the kind described by eq , and one may hope that the complete control over the microscopic ( trans - planckian ) physics in these systems would help understanding the nature of the issues discussed above .    following this physical insight we investigated the energy - dependent behavior of sound waves in a 2-component bose ",

    "building on the existence of so - called `` analogue models '' ( am ) for minimally coupled massless fields in curved spacetimes  @xcite , we shall show how to extend the am to include massive particles @xcite . as in the standard ansatz for quantum gravity phenomenology ,",
    "the dispersion relation ( now written in terms of frequency and wavenumber ) is modified by lorentz - violating terms at the `` lorentz violation scale '' @xmath61  which in the present context is the most suitable definition of an effective `` analogue planck scale '' @xcite : @xmath62 the determination , by the microphysics of the system , of the dimensionless coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 for both massive and mass - less quasi - particles will finally allow us to discuss the naturalness problem and universality issue in our 2-component am .",

    "for example , we consider two different hyperfine states , @xmath68 and @xmath69 of @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "they have different total angular momenta @xmath71 and therefore slightly different energies . that permits us , from a theoretical point of view , to keep @xmath72 , even if they are very nearly equal ( to about one part in @xmath73 ) . at the assumed ultra - cold temperatures and low densities",
    "the atoms interact only via low - energy collisions , and the 2-body atomic potential can be replaced by a contact potential . that leaves us with with three atom - atom coupling constants , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , for the interactions within and between the two hyperfine states . for our purposes it is essential to include an additional laser field , that drives transition between the two single - particle states .",
