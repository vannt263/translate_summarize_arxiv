    "in the last decades , modeling of dynamical systems , especially low - dimensional ones , becomes one of the most challenging areas of interest among mathematicians , physicists @xcite and many other sciences .",
    "depending on both the initial conditions as well as control parameters , such dynamical systems may present a very rich and hence complex dynamics , therefore leading to a variety of nonlinear phenomena .",
    "the dynamics can be considered either in the dissipative or non - dissipative regime @xcite yielding into new approaches , new formalisms therefore moving forward the progress of nonlinear science .    since the so called boltzmann ergodic theory @xcite",
    ", the assembly between statistical mechanics and thermodynamics has produced remarkable advances in the area leading also to progress in experimental and observational studies @xcite .",
    "indeed , statistical tools can be used for a complete analysis of the dynamical behavior of such type of systems .",
    "depending on the control parameters , phase transitions and abrupt changes in the phase space can be observed in time as well as in parameter space @xcite while many results can be described by using scaling laws approach @xcite . in this paper",
    "we revisit the 1-d impact system aiming to obtain and describe the behavior of average properties in the chaotic dynamics focusing in the stationary state , _ i d est _ , for very long time , where transient effects are not influencing the dynamics anymore .",
    "analytical expressions will be presented in order to calculate statistical properties for the average velocity , its deviation and the average squared velocity , when these variables reach the stationary state .",
    "the developed formalism , allows us to obtain the numerical values for these variables , without doing the numerical simulations .",
    "we will show a remarkable agreement between numerical simulations and theoretical analysis considering either statistical and thermal variables , giving so robustness , to the developed theory .",
    "the impact system is described by a free particle , or an ensemble of non interacting particles , moving under the presence of a constant gravitational field and experiencing collisions with a heavily vibrating platform @xcite . for elastic collisions ,",
    "the dynamics leads to a mixed phase space , described in velocity and time , and two main properties are observed according to the control parameter range .",
    "if the parameter is smaller than a critical one , invariant spanning curves , also called as invariant tori , are present in the phase space hence limiting the velocity of the particle in a chaotic diffusion for certain portions of the phase space . on the other hand , for a parameter larger than the critical one , invariant spanning curves are not present anymore and unlimited diffusion in velocity , for specific ranges of initial conditions , can be observed .",
    "the scenario is totally different when inelastic collisions are considered . in this case , dissipation is in course , hence contracting area in the phase space , therefore leading to the existence of attractors . for strong dissipation and control parameter beyond the critical one ,",
    "attractors are most periodic . for",
    "weak dissipation and large control parameter , chaotic attractors , characterized by a positive lyapunov exponent @xcite , dominate over the phase space .",
    "giving the attractors are far away from the infinity ( in velocity axis ) , dissipation has proved to be a powerful way of suppress unlimited diffusion . because of limited diffusion in phase space , the behavior and properties for both average velocity , average squared velocity or the deviation around the average velocity , known also as roughness , are the following .",
    "they grow to start with from a low initial velocity value and , eventually , they bend towards a stationary state @xcite at very long time .",
    "the scenario is scaling invariant with respect to the control parameters and number of collisions with the moving platform . by the use of equipartition theorem , the steady state , obtained in the asymptotic state , can be used to make a connection with the thermal equilibrium of the system @xcite .",
    "therefore in the present paper , we evaluate numerically , for long time series , the behavior of : ( i ) the average velocity ; ( ii ) the averaged squared velocity ; and ( iii ) the deviation around the average velocity , both for the dissipative impact system .",
    "we then compare the numerical results with analytical expressions at the equilibrium , obtained via statistical and thermodynamics analysis by using the dynamical equations @xcite .",
    "a comparison between the results obtained using numerical simulation and theoretical investigation is remarkable , hence giving robustness to the connection between statistical mechanics , thermodynamics and the modeling of dynamical systems .",
    "it also improves the theoretical formalism that can be extended to other different types of systems including the time dependent billiards .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we describe the dynamics of the impact system and some of its properties .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the discussion of the numerical investigation .",
    "the results using the dynamical equations and connection with the thermodynamics in the stationary state and the discussions of the results are presented in sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] brings some final remarks and conclusions .",
    "the model we consider consists of a particle of mass @xmath0 moving under the action of a gravitational field and experiences collisions with a heavy periodically moving wall .",
    "this model is also referred to as a bouncer or bouncing ball model .",
    "it backs to pustylnikov @xcite and has been studied for many years @xcite , with several applications in different areas of research such as vibration waves in a nanometric - sized mechanical contact system @xcite , granular materials @xcite , dynamic stability in human performance @xcite , mechanical vibrations @xcite , chaos control @xcite , crises between attractors @xcite , among many others .    as usual , the dynamics of the system is described by a two - dimensional , non - linear discrete mapping for the variables velocity of the particle @xmath1 and time @xmath2 ( will be measured latter on as function of the phase of moving wall ) immediately after a @xmath3 collision of the particle with the moving wall .",
    "@xcite for an analysis as function of the time .",
    "the investigations are made based on two main versions of the model : _",
    "( i ) _ complete , which takes into account the whole movement of the vibrating platform ; and _ ( ii ) _ a static wall approximation . in this version ,",
    "the nonlinear mapping assumes the wall is static but that , as soon as the particle hits it , there is an exchange of energy as if the wall were moving .",
    "this is then a simplified version and shows to be a very convenient way to find out analytical results in the model where transcendental equations do not need to be solved , as they have to be in the complete version .",
    "the two versions can be used either to investigate non - dissipative @xcite and dissipative dynamics @xcite .",
    "dissipation here is introduced by using a restitution coefficient @xmath4 $ ] upon collision . for @xmath5",
    "the system is non dissipative albeit area contraction in the phase is observed for @xmath6 .    to construct the mapping",
    ", we consider the motion of the platform is described by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , the amplitude and frequency of oscillation .",
    "moreover , we assume that at the instant @xmath10 , the position of the particle is the same as the position of the moving wall , hence @xmath11 and with velocity @xmath12 .",
    "the mapping then gives the evolution of the states from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , from @xmath14 to @xmath15 and so on . to obtain the analytical expressions of the mapping , we have to take into account the time of flight the particle moves without colliding with the wall and , from it , determine the velocity of the moving wall upon collision . from conservation of momentum law",
    "we obtain the velocity of the particle after collision .",
    "we have indeed four control parameters @xmath16 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath17 and not all of them are relevant for the dynamics . defining dimensionless and hence more convenient variables we have @xmath18 ( dimensionless velocity ) and @xmath19 , which is the ratio between accelerations of the vibrating platform and the gravitational field .",
    "we may also measure the time in terms of the number of oscillations of the moving wall @xmath20 . using this set of new variables ,",
    "the mapping is written as @xmath21~~{\\rm mod ( 2\\pi)}\\\\ \\end{array } \\right .",
    ", \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where the sub - index @xmath22 stands for the complete version of the model .",
    "the expressions for @xmath23 and @xmath24 depend on what kind of collision happens .",
    "for the case of multiple collisions , those the particle experiences without leaving the collision zone ( a region in space where the moving wall is allowed to move ) , the corresponding expressions are @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 is obtained from the condition that matches the same position for the particle and the moving wall .",
    "it leads to the following transcendental equation that must be solved numerically @xmath28    if the particle leaves the collision zone , than indirect collisions are observed .",
    "the expressions for the velocity and phase are @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 denoting the time spent by the particle in the upward direction up to reach the null velocity while the expression @xmath32 corresponds to the time the particle spends from the place where it had zero velocity to the entrance of the collision zone .",
    "finally the term @xmath27 has to be obtained numerically from the equation @xmath33 where @xmath34    for the static wall approximation @xcite , where no transcendental equations must be solved , the mapping has the form @xmath35~~{\\rm mod ( 2\\pi)}\\\\ \\end{array } \\right .. \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] the static wall approximation ( @xmath36 ) , as quoted in the sub - index of mapping ( [ eq4 ] ) is convenient to avoid solving transcendental equations .",
    "however , it inherently introduce a new problem that must be taken into account prior evolve the dynamical equations . in the complete version , after a collision with the moving wall , the particle , in specific cases and under certain conditions , can keep moving downward with negative velocity . of course",
    "if would lead to a successive collision in such a version of the model . in the static wall approximation , this type of collision is not allowed and a negative velocity would necessarily produce a non physical situation . to avoid this unphysical case , the modulus function is introduced and prevents the particle of the possibility of moving beyond the wall .",
    "when such a condition happens , the particle is just re - injected back into the dynamics with the same velocity before the collision , however in the upward direction .",
    "if the velocity is positive after a collision , the modulus function does not affect nothing the equation .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the phase space considering both non - dissipative and dissipative dynamics for the complete model .",
    "we used @xmath37 different initial conditions iterated up to @xmath38 collisions .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) shows the phase space for @xmath5 and @xmath39 . easily observed and typical of hamiltonian systems",
    "is the mixed dynamics scenario .",
    "it contains , indeed , stability islands and chaotic seas . because of the absence of invariant tori",
    "invariant spanning curves limiting the size of the chaotic sea  unlimited diffusion in velocity is observed .",
    "this phenomenon is known also as fermi acceleration ( fa ) @xcite can be slowed down by the presence of stickiness @xcite . in this case",
    ", a chaotic orbit may passes nearby a stability island and be trapped there around it for a finite time @xcite .",
    "opposite to trapping , the so called accelerating modes , produced by resonances , can affect globally the dynamics @xcite leading to a fast acceleration .",
    "dissipation , introduced by inelastic collisions , however destroys the mixed structure of the phase space . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) for @xmath40 and @xmath39 , the blurred points , suggesting a chaotic attractor , represent nothing more than transient orbits , which shall settle down at asymptotic fixed points ( sinks ) for a sufficiently long time .",
    "figure [ fig1](c ) was constructed using @xmath41 and @xmath5 .",
    "the mixed structure is not observed at this scale and only chaotic orbits , diffusing unlimitedly are observed .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) was obtained for @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",
    "the unlimited diffusion was replaced by a chaotic attractor , which has a limited range .",
    "this suppression was indeed expected since the determinant of the jacobian matrix is written as @xmath42 this result confirms that the introduction of dissipation can be considered as a powerful mechanism to suppress fermi acceleration @xcite .",
    "given the expressions of the mapping are already known , in this section , we describe the results obtained by numerical simulations .",
    "we focus particularly on the statistical analysis for the velocity of the particle . as it is already known @xcite , for large @xmath43 and in the presence of small dissipation , _ i d est _ , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the dynamics starting from either low or high velocity settles down at a stationary state for enough long time .",
    "the plateau of a saturation can be obtained from different ways : ( i ) imposing fixed point condition in the first equation of mappings ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) , after averaging them in an ensemble of phase @xmath46 $ ] ; ( ii ) transforming the equation of the velocity in the discrete mapping into a differential equation and solve it using an ensemble of different initial phases @xmath47 $ ] ; ( iii ) doing numerical simulations and considering long time dynamics .    because we have the dynamical equations of the mappings ,",
    "different statistical investigations can be made using different types of averages .",
    "an observable which is immediate is the average velocity measured along the orbit .",
    "it is written as @xmath48 we can use eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) and average it over an ensemble of different initial conditions , hence leading to @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents an ensemble of initial conditions . for instance , the initial velocity is assumed constant and @xmath50 different phases uniformly distributed in the range @xmath46 $ ] are considered .",
    "the root mean square velocity is obtained as @xmath51 the procedure is the same as running eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) but using @xmath52 rather than @xmath53 .",
    "finally , the deviation around the average velocity , @xmath54 , see @xcite for instance , is obtained from @xmath55    as it is known , for large @xmath43 , unlimited diffusion in velocity can be observed .",
    "because of the dissipation , the unlimited diffusion is not allowed anymore .",
    "the average dynamics , no mater the initial velocity , will converge to an asymptotic state for large time . if the initial condition is large , the velocity of the particle decreases until reaches the stationary state .",
    "it is known in the literature for a similar system , that the decay of velocity is given by an exponential function @xcite and the speed of the decay depends on the strength of the dissipation .",
    "stronger the dissipation , faster the decay .    in opposite way , starting with a small initial velocity , the dynamics leads the average velocity to experience an initial growth as a function of the number of collisions of the type @xmath56^{\\beta}$ ] .",
    "the acceleration exponent is @xmath57 , similar to random walk systems , and eventually , the growing regime is replaced by a constant plateau .",
    "the crossover that marks the change from growth to the saturation is described by a power law on @xmath58 , with @xmath59 .",
    "the average velocity of the particle at the stationary regime depends either on the nonlinear parameter as well on the dissipation parameter as @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "when the initial velocity is neither small or large , say below the saturation regime , an additional crossover time is observed in the curves @xcite .",
    "such addition crossover is indeed produced by a break of symmetry of the probability distribution function for the velocity of the particle leading then to a bias and hence , producing a preferential direction of diffusion , yielding in a growth of the average velocity .",
    "saturation is again observed for large enough time .",
    "based on the posed above , we show in fig . [ fig2 ] , the behavior of @xmath63 ( black circles and squares ) , @xmath64 ( red up and down triangles ) and @xmath54 ( blue right and left triangles ) as a function of the number of collisions @xmath65 . the initial velocities were chosen in two different regimes : ( i ) high . ]",
    "initial velocities @xmath66 and ; ( ii ) low initial velocities @xmath67 .",
    "we ensemble average the dynamics by considering the phase was equally distributed in the range @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "a comparison of the saturation of the three observables @xmath68 , @xmath64 and @xmath54 is better seen in figs .",
    "[ fig2](c , d ) .",
    "important to mention is that a change in the parameter @xmath43 leads to different saturation and it does not affect the crossover time . however , the parameter @xmath17 changes both the saturation ( stationary state ) and the crossover times . with a scaling approach , as done previously in the literature , see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite , a rescale can be done and overlap both curves , of the same observable , into an universal plot . however , in the scenario where high dissipation is considered , and we have low values for the parameter @xmath43 , the scaling invariance is very difficult to be observed , since we have successive boundary crisis between manifolds and crisis between attractors @xcite .    as we will see in the next section",
    ", the numerical values of the saturation plateaus play an important role in the thermodynamics analysis .",
    "the values of the plateaus for different values of the control parameters are shown in tables [ tab2 ] and [ tab1 ] .",
    "we see the saturation plateaus for the complete version are higher as compared to the static wall approximation .",
    "this is close connected to the probability distribution function of the velocity in the phase space . for short ,",
