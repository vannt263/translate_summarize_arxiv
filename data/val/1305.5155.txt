    "the equilibrium properties of steps on surfaces have been the subject of study for at least half a century @xcite . during the last two decades ,",
    "interest in steps has burgeoned @xcite , principally because of the important role they play in epitaxial growth , surface transport , catalysis , etc .",
    "those properties have great importance in the construction of nano and micro - electronic devices .",
    "steps can be created during sample preparation , such as by cutting a material at a miscut angle with respect to a closely packed plane . in the case of molecular - beam epitaxy ( mbe ) ,",
    "the steps act as sinks because they are the most favorable place for attachment , allowing some control of the morphology of the surface during growth and creating specified uniaxial defects rather than random growth of domains that progressively degrade uniformity .",
    "advances in experimental techniques have allowed the quantitative measurement of some statistical properties of these stepped surfaces @xcite .",
    "one of the most important equilibrium statistical properties is the terrace - width distribution ( twd ) , @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the scaled width , with @xmath3 the average of @xmath4 .",
    "the twd has relevant information about the interaction potential between steps @xcite ; the twd narrows as step - step repulsions increase .",
    "recent connections between theory and experiments have often relied on the generalized wigner surmise ( gws ) @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath7 are normalization constants which ensure @xmath8=1 for @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , for the typical case where stress dipoles at steps lead them to interact through a potential @xmath10 , it has been shown that there is a connection between @xmath11 and the exponent @xmath12 of the gws for the special cases @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 : explicitly we have that the dimensionless repulsion strength @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the step stiffness , and @xmath18 is the inverse thermal energy . the remarkable connection provided by eq .",
    "( [ eca ] ) can be found by mapping the interacting steps system onto the calogero - sutherland model @xcite , in which the particles interact through a potential @xmath19 .",
    "it is clear that the case @xmath20 corresponds to non - interacting steps ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 to attractive steps ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 to repulsive steps ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the calogero - sutherland model can be solved analytically ( the hamiltonian is integrable ) for the special cases of @xmath26 , and eq .  ( [ gws ] ) provides an excellent approximation to the spacings between adjacent particles @xcite . while the justification of eq .",
    "( [ eca ] ) is not so firmly established for arbitrary values of @xmath27 , the gws has nonetheless proved to be an excellent tool to describe theory , experimental and numerical results @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest models to describe fluctuations on steps is the terrace - step - kink model ( tsk ) @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the only excitations taken into account are the kinks along the steps .",
    "in particular , vacancies and adatoms on terraces are neglected .",
    "these simplifications restrict the applicability of the tsk model to low temperatures ( relative to the roughening temperature of the terraces ) .",
    "there are more sophisticated approaches @xcite based on kinetic monte carlo simulations @xcite of solid - on - solid ( sos ) models @xcite which take into account more thermal excitations , but they require more computational resources . moreover , the simplicity of the tsk results in better statistics for @xmath0 than the sos models in the low - temperature limit .",
    "our main objective is to calculate the twd for arbitrary interaction potentials in the case of finite - range interactions , i.e. , when each step interacts with a number @xmath28 of its neighbors through a potential @xmath29 .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic interest of this calculation , the question is very important for doing monte carlo simulations to test predictions of models like calogero - sutherland , which assume that all steps interact . when step - step interactions are included in simulations ,",
    "invariably only nearest - neighbor interactions are included @xcite .",
    "including second or third neighbor interactions in the simulations algorithm would be cumbersome but feasible .",
    "however , doing so invites questions of whether such longer - range interactions are screened by intervening steps or have their  bare \" form .",
    "another important issue is what happens if the step interactions are not of the generic inverse - square form , in particular if they decay more slowly , often leading to instabilities . in accounting for the idiosyncratic step network on au(110 ) and pt(110 ) , carlon and van beijeren find what amounts to an @xmath30 repulsion @xcite .",
    "stress domains lead to logarithmic interactions , notably in the case of terraces with alternating mutually - perpendicular domains on vicinal si(100 ) surfaces @xcite .    to proceed , we map the step system onto a 1d classical system of interacting particles .",
    "one advantage of this approach is that it is always possible to find analytically ( in laplace space ) the spacing - distribution functions for these 1d classical systems . in particular ,",
    "the nearest - neighbor distribution ( twd ) is easy to obtain .",
    "additionally , it allows one to determine how relevant are the interactions beyond the nearest - neighbors in the functional form of the twd .",
    "the applicability of our model is tested with several monte carlo simulations and some experimental results .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the terrace - step - kink ( tsk ) model for interacting steps , in sec .",
    "iii we develop an analytical model for the twd for the cases @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in this section ,",
    "the case of arbitrary values of @xmath1 is also discussed . finally in sec .",
    "iv we provide some conclusions .",
    "since overhangs are prohibited in the tsk model , the position of the @xmath33-th step can be described by a function @xmath34 where we have used `` maryland notation '' @xcite , in which @xmath35 is the `` time - like '' direction along the step .",
    "then , the indices satisfy @xmath36 $ ] , with @xmath37 the number of steps , and @xmath38 $ ] with @xmath39 the length of the lattice in @xmath40 direction .",
    "the fermionic non - touching condition imposes the additional restriction @xmath41 for all @xmath33 and @xmath42 . for the sake of simplicity , in our model the lattice constant",
    "is set to unity .",
    "we also impose periodic boundary conditions in both @xmath43 and @xmath40 directions .    in the tsk model",

    "the most studied case corresponds to @xmath50 , which is usually called non - interacting steps .",
    "however , we emphasize that even in this case the steps represented by eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) interact entropically due the non - touching condition , taking the well - defined thermodynamic form when @xmath51 for @xmath39 smaller than @xmath52 the steps fluctuate independently of each other @xcite .",
    "the case of non - interacting steps is well described by the free - fermion analogy . in this picture , the steps are modeled as world lines of free spinless fermions @xcite .",
    "this analogy leads to the use of the wigner surmise with @xmath20 to describe @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "dyson showed @xcite long ago that the statistical behavior of a 1d free - fermion system ( non - interacting steps ) is equivalent to that of a 1d system of classical brownian particles @xcite .",
    "then , in terms of a 1d classical system , the non - interacting steps can be interpreted as the world lines of a system with @xmath37 particles on a ring which interact via a logarithmic potential at an inverse temperature @xmath53 .",
    "explicitly , the hamiltonian of this system is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the position of the @xmath33-th particle at time @xmath56 .",
    "if we interpret the time axis as the @xmath40-axis of the vicinal surface , we can represent the steps in the tsk model as the time evolution of the positions of particles in a 1d classical system ( after making the step - continuum approximation or working in discrete time ) . in this equivalent system the interparticle gap size distribution plays the role of the twd .",
    "to map the interacting step system onto a classical 1d system of interacting particles , we consider @xmath37 particles can move around a circle with circumference @xmath57 , with @xmath3 the average distance between particles .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are perforce imposed , that is , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the position of the @xmath60-th particle .",
