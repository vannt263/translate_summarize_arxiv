    "the goal of nuclear physics is to explain the properties of atomic nuclei in fundamental terms  where the stress is on _ fundamental_. the debate then begins with what the fundamental ingredients ( or ` first principles ' ) are from which we should start .",
    "nuclear physics is strong interaction physics , so , based upon the standard model , it should be quarks exchanging gluons .",
    "however , in the spirit of the currently fashionable effective field theories , one may argue that any theory is effective , and what theory is appropriate depends on the energy scale . in fact , weinberg  @xcite pointed out 20 years ago that an effective field theory of nucleons and mesons that observes the same symmetries as qcd is equivalent to qcd .",
    "this allows us to consider mesons and nucleons as the basic items , on our energy scale .",
    "the spin - off from the mesons is the nuclear force .",
    "thus , it is suggested that the appropriate fundamental ingredients that nuclear structure should be based upon are nucleons and the ` fundamental ' nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction ( created by meson exchange ) .",
    "the above discussion also provides clear guideline for how to extend the model if it fails .",
    "one may introduce explicit meson degrees of freedom and one may complement the nucleon by meson - nucleon resonances ( e.g. , the @xmath0 isobar ) ; moreover , one may take into account the quark substructure of nucleons .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the starting point  besides being fundamental  must also be simple .",
    "nucleons interacting via the two - nucleon force is the simplest of all basic pictures .",
    "only where we have clear evidence that this frame work is insufficient may we extend it . for most problems of conventional nuclear structure",
    ", we do not have such evidence at this time .",
    "starting from nucleons and the bare two - nucleon force , any nuclear many - body problem one may consider is exactly defined .",
    "however , due to limitations in computing power , the problem can be solved exactly only up to @xmath1  @xcite , and since the needed computing time goes up as factorial of @xmath2 , there is little hope that we will ever get beyond @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , in most problems of nuclear structure and reactions , the first step is to derive an effective interaction from the bare nn potential .",
    "usually , this involves brueckner theory or some variation / extension thereof  @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to stress that  no matter what many - body theory or model is used  this step has to be done in a _",
    "parameter - free _ way .",
    "finally , the effective interaction may be applied in the shell model , yielding predictions for nuclear properties .    following this scheme ( which is known as _",
    "microscopic _ nuclear structure ) , the predictions depend only on two fundamental items : the bare nn potential and the nuclear many - body theory / model applied .",
    "thus , the comparison of the predictions with the data will allow for conclusions concerning the nn potential ( off - shell ) and the appropriate nuclear many - body theory .",
    "in other words , we will learn something about the foundations of our profession , which is our ultimate goal .",
    "in this conference , we have many contributions that deal with particular effective interactions , shell - model applications , predicted and measured nuclear properties .",
    "it is the purpose of this contribution to fill - in on one of the fundamental ingredients that is at the outset of all this , namely , the nn interaction .",
    "as it turns out , we have had substantial progress in recent years and  as a result of this  the starting conditions for _ microscopic _ nuclear structure calculations are better than ever .    to put the recent advances into perspective , i will start with a brief historical review and then present the new developments .",
    "artificially , i will draw the line between ` history ' and recent progress / new developments in the year of 1990 .",
    "here , i will give a brief summary of the status in the field of nuclear forces before 1990 .",
    "this will make it easier for us to appreciate the progress of the past eight years .",
    "historically , one may distinguish between three decades of work on the meson theory of nuclear forces , namely , the 60 s , 70 s , and 80 s .",
    "each decade is characterized by progress in a particular sector of meson theory , namely , the one - boson - exchange model , the two - pion exchange contribution to the nn interaction , and contributions beyond @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the first quantitative meson - theoretic models for the nn interaction were the one - boson - exchange potentials ( obep ) .",
    "they emerged right after the experimental discovery of heavy mesons in the early 1960 s . in general , about six non - strange bosons with masses below 1 gev",
    "are taken into account : the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the vector mesons @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and two scalar bosons @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the first particle in each group is isovector ( isospin @xmath11 ) while the second is isoscalar ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the pion provides the tensor force , which is reduced at short range by the @xmath13 meson .",
    "the @xmath14 creates the spin - orbit force and the short - range repulsion , and the @xmath15 is responsible for the intermediate - range attraction .",
    "thus , it is easy to understand why a model which includes at least four mesons can reproduce the major properties of the nuclear force .    a classic example for an obep is the bryan - scott potential published in 1969  @xcite .",
    "since it is suggestive to think of a potential as a function of @xmath16 ( where @xmath16 denotes the distance between the centers of the two interacting nucleons ) , the obep s of the 1960 s where represented as local @xmath16-space potentials . to reduce the original one - meson - exchange feynman amplitudes to such a simple form , drastic approximations have to be applied . the usual method is to expand the amplitude in terms of @xmath17 and keep only terms up to first order ( and , in many cases , not even all of them ) .",
    "commonly , this is called the _ nonrelativistic obep_. besides the suggestive character of a local function of @xmath16 , such potentials are easy to apply in @xmath16-space calculations",
    ". however , the original potential ( feynman amplitudes ) is nonlocal , and , thus , has a very different off - shell behaviour than its local approximation .",
    "though this does not play a great role in two - nucleon scattering , it becomes important when the potential is applied to the nuclear few- and many - body problem .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the original nonlocal potential leads to much better predictions in nuclear structure than the local approximation ( see below ) .",
    "historically , one must understand that after the failure of the pion theories in the 1950 s , the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model was considered a great success in the 1960 s . however , there are conceptual and quantitative problems with this model .",
    "a questionable point of the obe model is the fact that it has to introduce a scalar - isoscalar @xmath18-boson in the mass range 500700 mev , the existence of which is controversial ( for a current status report , see ref .",
    "furthermore , the model is restricted to single exchanges of bosons that are ` laddered ' in an unitarizing equation .",
    "thus , irreducible multi - meson exchanges , which may be quite sizable ( see below ) , are neglected .",
    "quantitatively , a major drawback of the _ nonrelativistic _ obe model is its failure to describe certain partial waves correctly . the bryan - scott nonrelativistic obe potential predicts @xmath19 and @xmath20 phases substantially above the data .",
    "@xcite    an important advance during the 1970 s has been the development of the _ relativistic obep _  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the full , relativistic feynman amplitudes for the various one - boson - exchanges are used to define the potential .",
    "these nonlocal expressions do not pose any numerical problems when used in momentum space .",
    "the quantitative deficiencies of the nonrelativistic obep disappear when the non - simplified , relativistic , nonlocal obe amplitudes are used .",
    "the _ nijmegen potential _",
    "@xcite , published in 1978 , is a nonrelativistic @xmath16-space obep . as a latecomer ,",
    "it is one of the most sophisticated examples of its kind .",
    "it includes all non - strange mesons of the pseudoscalar , vector , and scalar nonet .",
    "thus , besides the six mesons mentioned above , the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are taken into account .",
    "the model also includes the dominant j=0 parts of the pomeron and tensor ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) trajectories , which essentially lead to repulsive central gaussian potentials . for the pomeron ( which from today s point of view may be considered as a multi - gluon exchange )",
    "a mass of 308 mev is assumed .",
    "however , this potential is still defined in terms of the nonrelativistic local approximations to the obe amplitudes .",
    "therefore , it shows exactly the same problems as its ten years older counterpart , the bryan - scott potential : the nijmegen potential fails to predict the @xmath19 and @xmath20 phase shifts correctly to the same extent as the bryan - scott potential .",
    "in addition , the nijmegen potential overpredicts the @xmath27 phase shifts by more than a factor of two  @xcite , a problem the models of the 1960 s did not have .",
    "the inclusion of more bosons does obviously not improve the model and is , thus , unnecessary .",
    "it is more important to calculate the one - boson exchange amplitudes correctly and without the local approximations .      in",
    "the 1970 s , work on the meson theory of the nuclear force focused on the @xmath4-exchange contribution to the nn interaction to replace the @xmath15-boson .",
    "one way to calculate these contributions is by means of dispersion relations .",
    "around 1970 , many groups throughout the world were involved in this approach ; we mention here , in particular , the stony brook  @xcite and the paris  @xcite groups .",
    "these groups could show that the intermediate - range part of the nuclear force is , indeed , decribed correctly by the @xmath28-exchange as obtained from dispersion integrals .    to construct a complete potential , the stony brook as well as",
    "the paris group complemented their @xmath28-exchange contribution by one - pion - exchange ( ope ) and @xmath14 exchange .",
    "in addition to this , the paris potential  @xcite contains a phenomenological short - range potential for @xmath29 fm .    in microscopic nuclear structure calculations ,",
    "the off - shell behavior of the nn potential is important .",
    "the fit of nn potentials to two - nucleon data fixes them only on - shell .",
    "the off - shell behavior can not , in principle , be extracted from two - body data .",
    "theory could determine the off - shell nature of the potential ; however , not every theory can do that .",
    "dispersion theory relates observables ( equivalent to on - shell @xmath30-matrices ) to observables ; e.  g. , @xmath31 data to @xmath32 data .",
    "thus , dispersion theory can not , in principle , provide any off - shell information .",
    "the paris potential is based upon dispersion theory ; thus , the off - shell behavior of this potential is not determined by the underlying theory . on the other hand ,",
    "every potential does have an off - shell behavior .",
    "when undetermined by theory , then the off - shell behavior is a silent by - product of the parametrization chosen to fit the on - shell @xmath30-matrix , with which the potential is identified . in summary , due to its basis in dispersion theory , the off - shell behaviour of the paris potential is not derived on theoretical grounds .",
    "this is a serious drawback when it comes to the question of how to interpret nuclear structure results obtained with this potential .      in a field - theoretic picture ,",
    "the interaction between mesons and baryons is described by effective lagrangians .",
    "the nn interaction can then be derived in terms of field - theoretic perturbation theory .",
    "the lowest order ( that is , the second order in terms of meson - baryon interactions ) are the one - boson - exchange diagrams , which are easy to calculate .    more difficult ( and more numerous ) are the irreducible two - meson - exchange ( or fourth order ) diagrams .",
    "it is reasonable to start with the contributions of longest range .",
    "these are the graphs that exchange two pions .",
    "there are two complications that need to be taken into account : meson - nucleon resonances and meson - meson scattering .",
    "the lowest @xmath31 resonance , the so - called @xmath33 isobar with a mass of 1232 mev , gives rise to one set of diagrams .",
    "the other set involves @xmath34 interactions .",
    "since it is well established that two pions in relative @xmath35-wave form a resonance ( the @xmath13 meson ) , there is no problem with @xmath13 exchange .",
    "however , the existence of a proper resonance in @xmath36-wave below 900 mev is controversial  @xcite . in any case , there are strong correlations between two pions in @xmath37-wave at low energies .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that these correlations can be described in terms of a broad mass distribution of about @xmath38 mev , which in turn can be approximated by a zero - width scalar - isoscalar ( @xmath15 ) boson of mass 550 mev  @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "two approaches are available for calculating the @xmath4-exchange contribution to the nn interaction : dispersion theory ( paris  @xcite ) and field theory ( bonn  @xcite ) .",
    "one can compare the predictions by the two approaches with each other as well as with the data .",
    "for this purpose , one looks into the peripheral partial waves of nn scattering . by and large ,",
    "one finds satisfactory agreement  @xcite .",
    "a model consisting of @xmath40 describes the peripheral partial waves quite satisfactory .",
    "however , when proceeding to lower partial waves ( equivalent to shorter internucleonic distances ) , this model generates too much attraction .",
    "this is true for the dispersion - theoretic ( paris ) as well as the field - theoretic ( bonn ) result .",
    "obviously , further measures have to be taken at short range to arrive at a quantitative model for the nn interaction .",
    "it is at this point that the philosophies of the bonn and paris groups diverge .",
    "the paris group decided to give up meson theory at this stage and to describe everything that is still missing by phenomenology .",
    "thus , they added a phenomenological short - range potential for @xmath41 fm which requires many parameters ( see table  1 , below ) that do not allow for a clear - cut physical interpretation .",
    "this short - range potential affects the s- , p- , and d - waves of nn scattering which are , therefore , largely a product of phenomenology in the paris model .",
    "in contrast , the bonn group continued to consider further irreducible two - meson exchanges .",
    "the next set of diagrams to be considered are the exchanges of @xmath42 and @xmath13 .",
    "as it turns out , these contributions very accurately take care of the discrepancies that remained between theory and experiment  @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath43 contributions provide the short - range repulsion which was still missing .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath43 contributions have only one free parameter , namely the cutoff for the @xmath44 vertex .",
    "the other parameters involved occur also in other parts of the model and were fixed before ( like the @xmath45 and @xmath46 coupling constants and cutoff parameters ) .",
    "notice also that the @xmath47 and @xmath44 coupling constants are not free parameters , since they are related to the corresponding @xmath32 coupling constants by @xmath48 .    in summary , a proper meson - theory for the nn interaction should include the irreducible diagrams of @xmath43 exchange .",
    "this contribution has only one free parameter and makes comprehensive short - range phenomenology unnecessary .",
    "thus , meson theory can be truly tested in the low - energy nn system .    in the 1970 s and 80 s , a field - theoretic model for the nn interaction",
    "was developed at the university of bonn .",
    "this model consists of single @xmath42 , @xmath14 , and @xmath49 exchange , the field - theoretic @xmath4 model , and @xmath43 diagrams , as well as a few more irreducible @xmath50 and @xmath51 diagrams ( which are not very important , but indicate convergence of the diagrammatic expansion ) .",
    "this quasi - potential has become known as the ` bonn full model '  @xcite .",
    "it has 12 parameters which are the coupling constants and cutoff masses of the meson - nucleon vertices involved . with a reasonable choice for these parameters ,",
    "a very satisfactory description of the nn observables up to 300 mev is achieved ( see table  1 ) .",
    "since the goal of the bonn model was to put meson theory to a real test , no attempt was ever made to minimize the @xmath52 of the fit of the nn data .",
    "nevertheless , the bonn full model shows the smallest @xmath53 for the fit of the nn data among the traditional models .",
    ".comparison of some typical meson - theoretic nucleon - nucleon models of the pre-1990 era . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for heavier systems , the brueckner @xmath54-matrix is the basic quantity for all calculations of nuclear ground and excited states .",
    "the @xmath54-matrix is the solution of the bethe - goldstone equation , @xmath55 which differs from the lippmann - schwinger equation , eq .",
    "( 16 ) , in two points : the pauli projector @xmath56 and the energy denominator .",
    "( for simplicity , i assume in eq .  ( 25 ) the so - called continuous choice for the single particle energies in nuclear matter , i.  e. , the energy of a nucleon is represented by @xmath57 for @xmath58 as well as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the effective mass and @xmath61 a positive constant . )",
    "the pauli projector prevents scattering into occupied states and , thus , cuts out the low momenta in the @xmath62 integration .",
    "the change introduced by the pauli projector is known as the pauli effect .",
    "the energy denominator gives rise to the so - called dispersive effect .",
    "when using the continuous choice , the dispersive effect is given simply by the replacement of @xmath63 by @xmath60 ( @xmath64 at nuclear matter density ) in the numerator of the integral term , which leads to a reduction of this attractive term by a factor @xmath65 .",
    "both effects are in the same direction , namely they quench the integral term .",
    "since the integral term is negative , these effects are repulsive .    in table 3 ,",
    "nuclear matter results are given for three representative high - precision potentials using the brueckner pair approximation and the conventional choice for the single particle potential .",
    "for the reasons discussed , the largest difference between the predictions occurs in the @xmath66 state where the tensor force is involved . in the @xmath67 state ,",
    "only the central force can contribute which is nonlocal for cd - bonn and nijm - i .",
    "this explains why the binding energy predicted for this state is the same for these two potentials , and is larger than the value predicted by the local potential nijm - ii .",
    "note that there are further contributions in nuclear matter beyond the brueckner pair approximation .",
    "three- and four - body clusters contribute about 4 mev attraction  @xcite and the medium effect on the dirac spinors representing the nucleons in nuclear matter creates about 2 mev repulsion  @xcite resulting in a net correction of about 2 mev .",
    "this brings the prediction of the nonlocal potential into good agreement with the empirical nuclear matter value of @xmath68 mev .",
    "the trend of the nonlocal bonn potential to increase binding energies has also a very favorable impact on predictions for spectra of open - shell nuclei  @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , most many - body forces are an artifact of theory . they are created by ` freezing out ' degrees of freedom contained in the full hamiltonian of the problem .",
    "this fact allows us to derive a guideline for dealing with the many - body - force issue in a consistent way : when you introduce a new degree of freedom , do not freeze it out ; instead take it into account in the two- _ and _ many - body problem , consistently .",
    "field - theoretic models for the @xmath4-exchange contribution to the nn interaction require the @xmath0 isobar , which also creates a three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) in the many - body system .",
    "consequently , when introducing the isobar degree of freedom , it should be included in the two- and three - body force simultaneously .",
    "when these forces are applied in the many - body problem , then one is faced with two effects : a ( repulsive ) medium effect on the two - body force [ fig .",
    "3(a ) ] and an attractive 3nf contribution [ fig  3(b ) ] .",
    "the repulsive medium effect has been known for more than 20 years  @xcite .",
    "_ consistency requires that either both effects are taken into account or none . _ consistent calculations of this kind have first been conducted by the hannover group  @xcite for the triton .",
    "recently , these calculations have been improved and extended by picklesimer and coworkers  @xcite using the argonne @xmath69 @xmath33-model  @xcite .",
    "they find an attractive contribution to the triton energy of 0.66 mev from the 3nf diagrams created by the @xmath33 , and a repulsive contribution of + 1.08 mev from the dispersive effect on the two - nucleon force involving @xmath33 isobars .",
    "the total result is _ 0.42 mev repulsion _",
    "@xcite .",
    "a contribution that is missing in the @xmath33 3nf model is the s - wave part of the off - shell @xmath31 amplitude .",
    "estimates for this contribution vary between 0.2 and 0.6 mev  @xcite . adding this to the argonne @xmath69 result [ i.  e. , @xmath70 mev ] yields a vanishing result for the total contribution from three - body forces .    in the more traditional calculations , it was customary to employ the so - called 2@xmath42-exchange three - nucleon force .",
    "this approach does not take the dispersive effects into account and overbinds the triton , at least if commonly accepted values for the cut - off parameter of the strong pion - nucleon vertex are used .",
    "moreover , this type of 3n force fails in 3n scattering  @xcite casting additional doubt on its reality .    besides the @xmath33-isobar",
    ", there are other mechnisms that can give rise to three - nucleon forces . in recent years , it has become fashionable to consider chiral lagrangians for nuclear interactions .",
    "such langrangians may create diagrams which represent effective three - nucleon potentials .",
    "however , weinberg has shown that all these diagrams cancel  @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "any _ consistent _ three - body force calculation  conducted to date  has yielded vanishing results .",
    "this implies that the two - body force should provide essentially all binding energies observed in nuclei .",
    "the further implication then is that nonlocal / weak - tensor force nn interactions are to be favored over hard / local potentials .",
    "it is probably not just an accident that these soft / nonlocal potentials are also more faithful to the underlying theory of nuclear forces .",
    "several high - quality / high - precision nn potentials are now available which fit the low - energy nn data with identical perfection .",
    "these potentials differ , however , in their off - shell behavior .",
    "thus , the stage is set for a reliable investigation of off - shell effects in microscopic nuclear structure calculations .",
    "such calculations may finally teach us something about the off - shell nature of the nuclear force .",
    "this is _ the _ time to do _",
    "microscopic _ nuclear structure calculations !",
