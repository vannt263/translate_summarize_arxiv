    "game theory has been used extensively as a quantitative framework for studying communication networks and distributed control systems among its other applications in engineering and economics .",
    "game theoretic models provide not only a basis for analysis but also for design of network protocols and decentralized control schemes  @xcite . despite widespread use of ( noncooperative ) game theory in engineering",
    ", there is surprisingly little work on _ how to design games _ such that their outcome satisfies certain global objectives .    while there is a general agreement on the usefulness of game theory , the issues of * price of anarchy * or _ efficiency loss _ associated with noncooperative games even under the existence of pricing mechanisms , have been the subject of many investigations  @xcite .",
    "consequently , different pricing schemes have been proposed in the literature aiming to improve nash equilibrium ( ne ) efficiency with respect to a chosen criterion in specific settings  @xcite .",
    "the research community has revisited the issue of game design again very recently  @xcite .",
    "these studies are limited either to special problem formulations or adopt specific efficiency criteria such as the `` system problem '' of  @xcite",
    ". a related early line of work focuses specifically on three agent ( player ) dynamic noncooperative games with multi - levels of hierarchy  @xcite , where it has been shown that the leader has an optimal incentive policy which is linear in the partial dynamic measurement and induces the desired behavior on the two followers . in addition",
    ", a separate but substantial literature exists under the umbrella of implementation theory , especially in the field of economics , which focuses on finding fundamental bounds for games where the outcome satisfies some given criteria  @xcite .",
    "these works , however , are often not algorithmic and do not have an engineering perspective .",
    "the * main contribution * of this paper is a treatment of game design from an optimization and control theoretic perspective .",
    "a fairly general class of games are considered , which have been applied to a number of settings including network congestion control , wireless uplink power control , and optical power control  @xcite .",
    "this paper -to the best of our knowledge- constitutes one of the few efforts aiming to investigate the general problem of game design in a constructive manner _ from an optimization and control theoretic perspective _    while it is straightforward to optimize ne according to some criterion under full information , the problem is much more complicated under information and communication constraints .",
    "the game or system designer ( figure  [ fig : nedesign1 ] ) usually does not have full information about the system parameters such as user preferences or utility functions . under this kind of information constraints , the designer either deploys additional dynamic feedback mechanisms or requires side information from the system depending on the specific design objectives .",
    "an example for the former case is a dynamic pricing scheme operating as an `` outer feedback loop '' .",
    "if the objective is to achieve a social optimum ( e.g. maximization of sum of user utilities ) or satisfying some quality of service ( qos ) conditions , then the designer often needs limited but accurate ( honest ) information from users or the system .",
    "it is important to note that if the users have the capability of manipulating such side information , then the design problem can be more involved or even ill - defined . for example , the goal of reaching a social optimum without knowing true user utilities but having only access to manipulated data may not be a realistic or even feasible one  @xcite .",
    "although mechanisms such as vcg have been proposed to circumvent these issues , the resulting schemes are often limited and demanding in terms of communication requirements  @xcite . as a starting point ,",
    "the treatment in this paper is restricted to a class of games where * players do not manipulate the game * by deceiving the system designer .",
    "such players are sometimes called `` _ _ price - taking _ _ '' as opposed to manipulative or `` price - anticipating '' .",
    "thus , the utility functions are assumed here to accurately reflect player preferences .",
    "as an * additional contribution * , this paper analyzes dynamic systems arising from game formulations and the general case of non - separable player utilities . in such cases of coupled utility functions ,",
    "the utility of each player is affected by decisions of other players .",
    "the control theoretic approach adopted here based on game dynamics provides a more realistic model for a number of applications compared to a static optimization one .",
    "stability properties of game and pricing dynamics are investigated under the assumption of time - scale separation and in two separate time - scales using lyapunov theory and singular perturbation approach .",
    "the sufficient conditions derived , which ensure system stability , are illustrated with examples .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section introduces the underlying game model and problem formulation . section  [ sec : static ] studies static design of games . in section  [ sec : dynamic ] , a dynamic control of games is discussed .",

    "consider a generic class of @xmath0 player static noncooperative games , denoted by @xmath1 , on the action ( strategy ) space @xmath2 .",
    "the actions of players , who are autonomous decision makers , are denoted by the vector @xmath3 , with @xmath4 being the @xmath5 player s action .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath5 player is associated with a smooth ( continuously differentiable ) cost function , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , parametrized by a scalar `` pricing '' or game parameter @xmath8 . in some formulations",
    ", there may be ( coupled ) restrictions on the domain of these parameters such that @xmath9 .",
    "assuming a set of sufficient conditions for the existence of at least one nash equilibrium ( ne ) are satisfied , define a game mapping , @xmath10 ( an inverse game mapping @xmath11 ) that maps game parameters @xmath12 to ne points ( ne points to parameters ) : @xmath13 such that @xmath14 for any ne point @xmath15 and corresponding parameter vector @xmath16 .",
    "notice that the mappings @xmath10 and @xmath11 are highly nonlinear , often not explicitly expressible , and may not be one - to - one or invertible except for special cases , i.e. games with special properties .",

    "in addition , the derivative of at least one of the constraints with respect to @xmath4 , @xmath44 , is nonzero for @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "if assumptions [ assm1]-[assm4 ] are satisfied , then the class of games @xmath27 admits a unique nash equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , this unique ne can be an inner or a boundary solution .",

    "assume that the utility function @xmath21 accurately reflects the preferences of users or players , who are _ autonomous ( independent ) decision makers_. then , the pricing function @xmath20 and parameters @xmath12 are in this setting the _ only _ tools for the system designer to influence ( optimize or control ) the game outcome in order to achieve a desired objective .",
    "this task described in problem  [ problem1 ] is similar -in spirit- to the goal of implementation theory or mechanism design in the economics literature  @xcite with the important difference of not allowing users to knowingly manipulate the system , i.e. assuming price - taking users only .",
    "this game design problem is illustrated in figure  [ fig : ne1 ] .",
    "is moved to a feasible desired region @xmath47 or a specific optimal point @xmath48 .",
    "[ fig : ne1 ] ]    [ problem1 ] how to choose the pricing function @xmath49 and parameters @xmath12 such that the ne of games of class @xmath17 satisfies some desirable properties ?",
    "two specific but common examples of such properties are    1 .",
    "the ne coincides with the solution of a global optimization problem , e.g. welfare maximization : @xmath50 2 .",
    "the ne satisfies some system or user - dependent constraints such as capacity constraints , non - negativity , or performance bounds .",

    "an important aspect of problem  [ problem1 ] is the amount of knowledge available to the system designer in optimization of ne .",
    "if there is complete knowledge of player preferences and global system objective , then the approach to be adopted can be quite different from the one when the designer has very limited information . in cases when the game dynamics are very fast , it is appropriate to focus on static optimization of the ne point",
    ". then , the actions of the system designer are assumed to be on a slower time - scale than the actual game dynamics between the players resulting in a hierarchical structure .",
    "this scenario is discussed in the next section .",
    "when the game designer has a way of estimating game parameters , the game design can be posed as a static optimization problem , especially when the game dynamics are very fast and the actions of the system designer are on a slower time - scale than the actual game dynamics between the players .",
    "in contrast , section  [ sec : dynamic ] presents a dynamic control approach appropriate when the game dynamics are slow or there are external disturbances .",
    "then , the game is treated as a control system that needs to be stabilized around a desired point .",
    "when is it feasible to design a game such that the ne point can be located by the system designer to a point or region with desirable properties ? in the point case , let target point be @xmath48 .",
    "then , the problem is to find an @xmath56 such that @xmath57 , for any desirable feasible @xmath48 .",

    "theorem  [ thm : pricing ] can easily be extended to the case where users actions are on a multi - dimensional subspace if the users utility function is separable .",
    "notice that even a simple linear pricing function @xmath62 satisfies the conditions of the theorem and is sufficient for ne optimization . in this case",
    "any @xmath59 is feasible .",
    "however , a symmetric pricing scheme , where @xmath63 , is not sufficient in general .",
    "as other examples , for @xmath64 any @xmath48 is feasible , while for @xmath65 any @xmath66 is feasible .",
    "if a game admits multiple ne , e.g. games of class @xmath17 , then reaching a single desirable point does not make much sense .",
    "furthermore , the problem of locating all ne points to a desirable region can be rather complex .",
    "such cases can be handled either by exploiting any special structure of the game due to its specific problem domain or using numerical methods .",
    "it is interesting to note that due to the form of the player cost structure in  ( [ e : cost1 ] ) , i.e. additive linear pricing , the optimization problem of individual players in the game can be interpreted as a variant of _ legendre transform _  @xcite .",
    "in other words , given the other players actions , the utility function best response of a player is transformed to a best response function which takes the pricing parameter as argument .",
    "although tragedy of commons or price of anarchy are unavoidable in `` pure '' games without any external factors , they can be circumvented when additional mechanisms such as `` pricing '' are included in the game formulation . in parallel to some earlier results  @xcite , theorem  [ thm : pricing ] clearly establishes that _ `` loss of efficiency '' or `` price of anarchy '' _ are not an inherent feature of a fairly general class of games with built - in pricing systems .",
    "if there is sufficient information , then any game of class @xmath27 can be designed through simple ( e.g. linear ) pricing mechanisms in such a way that any desirable criteria such as welfare maximization or qos requirements are met at the unique ne solution .      in order to illustrate the underlying issues in game design problems with accurate but limited information , consider a noncooperative game formulation of the single - cell spread - spectrum uplink power control problem in wireless networks  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the game is played in a single cell with @xmath0 mobiles competing for quality of service in terms of signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) and the base station acts as the game designer .",
    "this can be formulated as a class @xmath27 game with the following general cost structure @xmath67 where the objective is to locate the ne to a region that satisfies some feasibility and qos constraints .",

    "then , each user @xmath68 decides on its own power level @xmath4 and is associated with the cost function @xmath25 in  ( [ e : expgameform1 ] ) .",
    "the desired region for the ne of this game could be shaped by feasibility constraints such as positivity of user actions ( here uplink transmission power levels ) and an upper - bound on the sum of them , and/or some chosen minimum sir levels ( assuming these are chosen such that the region is not empty ) .",
    "a concrete example region @xmath51 can be defined as @xmath73 where @xmath74 are user - specific minimum sir levels .",
    "a detailed analysis of an example case is provided next . for a separate but similar example of this formulation",

    "this is due to both matrices @xmath87 and @xmath82 being nonsingular as @xmath71 .",
    "hence , the appropriate pricing vector @xmath12 can be immediately obtained from the boundary solution @xmath88 and the definition of @xmath89 .",
    "many games are solved in a distributed manner .",
    "hence , the convergence of the system trajectory to the equilibrium point may not be very fast and the time - scale separation between system designers actions and actual game dynamics may fail . then , the game design can be modeled as a * feedback control system * which utilizes pricing as the control input and the desired target as the reference ( see figure  [ fig : control1 ] ) .",
    "this formulation also brings a certain robustness with respect to initial conditions or game ( system ) parameters .",

    "in addition , for the simple linear pricing function @xmath62 any @xmath48 is immediately reachable since @xmath107 is constant and invertible .",
    "alternatively , the problem can be posed as one of asymptotic set point regulation , i.e. , to find a feedback control of the form @xmath108 such that the system trajectory @xmath32 ( and eventually the ne ) converges to the desired reference point @xmath48  ( * ? ? ?",

    "the first necessary condition , which translates into feasibility condition for @xmath48 is that  ( [ e : system3 ] ) has an equilibrium at the origin , i.e. there exists a steady - state control @xmath112 that solves @xmath113 the component @xmath114 is the first component in @xmath12 needed to maintain equilibrium at the origin , while a second component is needed to asymptotically stabilize this equilibrium in the first approximation .",
