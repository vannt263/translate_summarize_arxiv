    "since their first experimental realization , atomic bose - einstein condensates have been used as a tool to study strongly interacting quantum systems .",
    "this made possible the study of exotic phases , especially in systems governed by hamiltonians not easily realized in condensed matter .",
    "soon after the initial work on spin-0 bosons @xcite , much effort was directed at the problem of mixtures of different kind of particles : fermions @xcite or mixtures of bosons and fermions  @xcite . however , in these studies , the effective spin degrees of freedom are frozen and the number of particles of each type is generally fixed .",
    "purely optical trapping techniques allow to trap the atoms without freezing the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "these systems exhibit both magnetic and superfluid properties offering the opportunity to study the interplay between these two effects . unlike in simple mixtures ,",
    "spin - spin interactions are present in these systems and can be either ferromagnetic ( @xmath0rb ) or antiferromagnetic ( @xmath1na)@xcite .    whereas current spin-@xmath2 experiments are in continuous space , a simple model was proposed @xcite for a system on an optical lattice with only two internal low energy states .",
    "the proposed system consider neutral polarizable atoms with three degenerate atomic ground states and three degenerate excited states characterized by the magnetic quantum number @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to generating a periodic ( optical lattice ) potential , the counter propagating lasers couple these internal ground and excited states by v and @xmath4 transitions which leads to only two low energy eigenstates denoted respectively @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "such particles with only two internal effective degrees of freedom are referred to as spin-1/2 bosons . as in the spin-1 case",
    ", the interaction between these spins can be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic and the presence of an optical lattice allows the system to become strongly correlated with superfluid ( sf ) or mott insulator ( mi ) phases . in previous work @xcite",
    ", we extended the original mean - field theory ( mft ) approach @xcite and studied the one - dimensional system with exact quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations .",
    "related spin-@xmath2 models were considered using mft @xcite or in one dimension using qmc @xcite . a similar model with two species of bosons that can convert into each other",
    "was also studied @xcite .    if the spin - spin interactions for the original spin one bosons are ferromagnetic ( f ) , the resulting on - site repulsions for spin 1/2 bosons are smaller between different particles than between identical particles  @xcite . in that case",
    "mft and qmc both show the system never polarizes @xcite ; in other words , the populations of the two species always remain equal . if the repulsion is strong enough , the system is in a mott insulating phase for commensurate densities and is otherwise superfluid",
    ". the transitions between the superfluid and the mott phases are always continuous .    in the case of antiferromagnetic ( af ) interactions for the original spin one bosons ,",
    "the repulsion between different particles is stronger than the repulsion between identical particles @xcite in the resulting spin 1/2 model and the system exhibits a richer phase diagram .",
    "first , the mott phases are polarized for odd densities while they are unpolarized for even ones .",
    "in addition , the superfluid phase is always polarized .",
    "finally , mft predicts second order transitions between the odd density mott phases and the superfluid whereas the transitions between even mi and sf can be first or second order depending on the strength of the interaction .",
    "this was not observed in the one dimensional qmc simulations @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy was not surprising since mft often fails in reduced dimensionality and also since first order phase transitions are generally absent in one dimension .",
    "another feature of the af regime is a phase transition between a polarized and an unpolarized phase inside the @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being the total particles density ) mott phase at low temperature observed with the qmc simulations .    in this paper , we extend the qmc study of this system to the two dimensional square lattice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will review the model and the techniques used to study it .",
    "sections iii and iv will be devoted to the presentation of our results for the cases of larger repulsion between different or identical particles , respectively .",

    ", a chemical potential term is added to the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "there are two density - density interaction terms ( eq .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) ) .",
    "the first describes repulsion between identical particles on the same site with an associated energy @xmath17 .",
    "the second describes the on - site repulsion between particles of different types . depending on the value of @xmath18",
    ", this repulsion can be stronger ( @xmath19 ) or smaller ( @xmath20 ) than the repulsion between identical particles . in this work",

    "is changed to map the phase diagram .",
    "finally the last term of the hamiltonian describes conversion between the species : as two identical particles collide on the same site , they can be converted into two particles of the other kind .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the matrix element for this conversion is equal to @xmath24 , that is , it is essentially the difference of interaction energies between identical and different particles .",
    "the sign of the conversion term ( eq .  ( [ h3 ] ) ) can be chosen freely due to a symmetry of the model @xcite . here",
    "our convention has the opposite sign of the original paper  @xcite .",

    "[ f_green](a ) , we see that @xmath118 and @xmath119 decay exponentially as expected .",

    "i.e. _ no conversion between species , this behavior of @xmath120 would correspond to a counter superfluid phase ( csf ) @xcite .",
    "however , in this system , due to the residual effects of the conversion term , it is not possible to calculate a corresponding counter superfluid density @xcite .",

    "the two species remain correlated , of course , since the system is still in a strongly interacting regime ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "this correlation can be observed , for example , from the fact that @xmath123 is larger than the product @xmath124 .",
    "this means that , while particles can move independently , exchanges of different particles are still present .     for @xmath84 for a total density @xmath6 and @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath96 .",

    "for the superfluid phase , there is long range coherence of all the green functions .",
    "[ f_green],width=321 ]    the @xmath61 mott phase is once again unpolarized ( the histogram is similar to the @xmath6 histogram shown in fig .",
    "[ f_histo_rho1 ] ) . in the @xmath127 limit ,",
    "there exist two possible degenerate ground states on each site .",
    "the first state is obtained by putting one particle of each type on a given site , thus obtaining an interaction energy @xmath128 as @xmath129 .",
    "the second state is the superposition of a state with two 0 particles and a state with two @xmath4 particles : @xmath130 gives in this case an energy @xmath22 , it is reduced to @xmath131 by the conversion term eq .",
    "for these two possible states , the mean densities @xmath39 and @xmath40 are equal and the system does not polarize which is directly observed in density histograms ( not shown here ) .",
    "the @xmath61 mott ground state then shows a large degeneracy in the @xmath60 on - site limit .",
    "all these degenerate states are once again coupled by second order contributions from the hopping term and the degeneracy is lifted by establishing a phase coherence of exchange movements .",
    "this can be understood in the following way : whether a site is occupied by two 0 particles , two @xmath4 particles or one 0 and one @xmath4 particle , the on site energy is the same , because the interaction energy is lower for different particles or because it is lowered by conversion term for identical particles .",
    "then starting from any configuration , exchanges of particles of different types will exchange the states of neighboring sites without changing the on site energy .",
    "a phase coherence is then established by exchange moves in the mott phase , reminiscent of the one observed in the @xmath6 case .",

    "in this work , we used qmc simulations to determine the phase diagram of the spin-1/2 bosonic hubbard model on a two - dimensional square lattice . for @xmath84 , we found that the numerical results to be in good agreement with mft , especially at very small @xmath62 where quantum fluctuations are highly suppressed .",
    "the system has three phases : a polarized superfluid , an unpolarized mott phase for @xmath61 ( and likely for all even mi lobes ) and a polarized mott phase for @xmath6 ( and likely for all odd mi lobes ) .",
    "we have shown that the polarization of this @xmath6 mott phase can be understood in terms of an effective anisotropic heisenberg model and that , in the ground state , the phase is completely polarized , although extremely low temperatures are needed to observe the polarization in the strongly interacting regime .",
    "the @xmath61 phase is not polarized due to the action of the conversion term that will transform pairs of identical particles into pairs of the other types of particles and then suppress possible polarization of the system .",
    "the first order mi - sf transition for the @xmath61 mi phase which was predicted by mft is confirmed numerically .",
    "in addition , the qmc results showed that in the @xmath6 mi lobe , moves which exchange the positions of a @xmath5 and a @xmath4 particles are present as evidenced by the saturation of the anticorrelated green function @xmath47 .",
    "this property was not previously addressed by mft calculations .    for @xmath113 ,",

    "the anisotropic heisenberg model approach shows the domination of an effective in - plane coupling , whereas for @xmath61 , the two possible degenerate states on each site are both unpolarized . here",
