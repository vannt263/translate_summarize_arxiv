    "the availability of quantum devices with characteristic length of only a few nanometer allows the implementation of a number of experimental setups that put under test the very foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "the fact that the radius of a landau level is of only a few nanometers for magnetic field strengths of around 10 tesla allows the verification of the aharonov - bohm effect in quantum rings @xcite , which leads to the presence of persistent currents @xcite .",
    "this persistent currents have been measured even for one electron states @xcite .",
    "the quantum rings are formed by only one semiconductor material , and the fabrication of multiple concentric quantum rings ( up to five ) can be achieved with high quality and reliability @xcite .",
    "the early realization that the quantum dots presented an ideal scenario to study transitions between electrically confined states and landau - type magnetic levels @xcite , originated numerous theoretical and experimental works attempting to explain the effect of the confinement potential over the observed spectrum .",
    "for example , peeters and collaborators studied the spectral properties of two - dimensional parabolic confinement potential @xcite , the effect of the confinement in the direction of the field ( or @xmath0 direction ) @xcite , and the spectral properties of a electron confined in an artificial molecule @xcite . anyway , even in the case of a finite confinement potential in the @xmath0 direction @xcite , these studies were restricted to the discrete spectrum of each problem .    on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum dot has been appointed as one of the most promising implementations of a single qubit @xcite .",
    "there has been a huge amount of work to circumvent the numerous associated problems : decoherence @xcite , the coupling between two qubits ( to implement a two - qubit quantum gate ) in double quantum dots has been studied extensively , in particular how it can be tuned using electric fields @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite , or the effect of the confinement of the double quantum dot in a quantum wire @xcite , etc .    when dealing with applied magnetic fields , most theoretical studies on quantum dots focus on strongly localized states , many times achieved using always - bounding potentials , as the three dimensional harmonic potential or impenetrable walls .",
    "the presence of a constant magnetic field , anyway , is equivalent to a two dimensional harmonic potential in the plane orthogonal to the field direction .",
    "conversely , there are far less examples of studies considering finite potentials , in particular those whose shapes or features allow the presence of resonance states .",
    "there is a number of reason to study finite potentials , from charge transport situations to the effect of resonance states in luminescent quantum dots .",
    "bylicki and jasklski @xcite analyzed the binding of shape resonances through the application of an external magnetic field .",
    "they considered an one - electron spherical quantum dot - quantum well structure ( qdqw ) . in this work",
    "we consider a closely related problem with the purpose of a better understanding of the transition from a resonance state to a bounded one .",
    "as has been said above , a constant magnetic field induces a two - dimensional harmonic potential that precludes the appearance of resonances in the plane orthogonal to the field , _ i.e. _ the loss of particles can take place * only * in the direction of the field , closing a number of decaying channels that would be available in absence of the field . in this sense",
    ", it renders almost irrelevant what particular shape has the binding potential , as long as it allows the appearance of resonances in the direction of the field .",
    "so , to avoid unnecessary complications , we consider a quantum dot model with cylindrical symmetry whose axis has the same direction that the magnetic field , besides we use the effective mass approximation ( ema ) .",
    "as it is well known in this approximation the many - body interactions of the electron trapped in the quantum dot are reduced to a ( simple ) bounding potential , and all the parameters of the hamiltonian , mass , dielectric constants , and so on are taken as equal to the the bulk parameters .    despite its apparent simplicity ,",
    "the calculation of the resonance states of one electron trapped in a bounding potential with an external magnetic field is far from trivial , in particular for small enough strengths of the field since the landau levels are bunched when the strength of the field goes to zero . to obtain the",
    "energy and width of the resonance states we employ the complex scaling method @xcite that , together with a square - integrable variational approximation for the wave function , has been used to analyze the bound and resonance states of two electron quantum dots @xcite .",
    "moreover , as has been shown in @xcite , the fidelity of the variational eigenstates is a good tool to detect the resonance states . in this work",
    "we use the fidelity to study the binding of a resonance and show that it is signaled by a sharp change in the behavior of the fidelity .",
    "this feature is consistent with the behavior observed in the fidelity when the system experiments a quantum phase transition ( in many - body models ) , is near the ionization threshold or to a resonance @xcite .",
    "recently , the application of concepts from quantum information theory , as the fidelity or entanglement , has been very fruitful to analyze bound and resonance states in few body systems as two - electron quantum dots @xcite , or two - electron he - like systems @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , the quantum dot model and the variational approximation that provides approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are presented in section  [ smodel ] .",
    "the analysis of the resonance using complex exterior scaling and the influence of the landau levels are presented in section  [ detecting ] , while the binding process is studied , using different methods , in sections  [ detecting],[sec : localization ] and [ sec : fidelity ] .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our results in section  [ discusion ] . some rather lengthly and technical results , mostly matrix elements are deferred to the appendices",
    "the bounding potential of the quantum dot is given by a piecewise function @xmath1 _ i.e. _ the potential is a cylindrical well aligned with the z - axis , with two potential steps at the top and the bottom of the cylinder , where the radius of the cylinder is @xmath2 , its height @xmath3 , the depth of the potential well , @xmath4 , and the height of the potential steps , @xmath5 .",
    "this ensures that , for properly chosen constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 the one electron problem has resonance states without external field .",
    "even with the introduction of the external field the angular momentum @xmath8 is a conserved quantity , and its eigenvalues good quantum numbers .",
    "so , we focus on states with zero angular momentum @xmath8 . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian reads as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is given by equation  [ eq : potential ] , @xmath11 is the effective mass of the electron in the semiconductor material .",
    "the equation is written in atomic units .",
    "if a magnetic field @xmath12 is applied , there is a new term that must be incorporated to the rhs of equation  [ eq : hamiltoniano ] , which results in the following hamiltonian @xcite @xmath13    the discrete spectrum and the resonance states of the model given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamil ] ) can be obtained approximately using square - integrable variational functions @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "so , if @xmath15 are the exact eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian , we look for variational approximations    @xmath16    where the @xmath17 must be chosen adequately , @xmath18 is the basis set size , and the @xmath19 are the linear variational parameters of the rayleigh - ritz method .",
    "since we are interested in null angular momentum eigenfunctions , and taking into account the symmetries of the hamiltonian  [ eq : hamil ] , we choose as basis functions @xmath20 where    @xmath21    and @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the non - linear variational parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are associated laguerre polynomials . as has been analyzed in previous works @xcite , when dealing with resonance states it is convenient to choose small values for the non - linear variational parameters . in particular , along this work",
    "we use @xmath27 . if @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , then @xmath32 .",
    "the matrix elements of the kinetic energy , the bounding potential and the magnetic field term are given in the appendix .",
    "with all these matrix elements we get a variational eigenvalue problem @xmath33 where the entries of the matrix @xmath34 are given by @xmath35    the ample range of materials and structures available to design self - assembled quantum dots precludes the possibility of a very general analysis , however , in part for comparison reasons , we use similar parameters than those used by bylicki in  @xcite and bylicki and jasklski in @xcite to model a quantum dot quantum well structure made of gallium arsenide ( gaas ) composites , _ i.e. _ @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the potential well depth is slightly different from the value used by bylicki , but should be chosen so owed to the cylindrical symmetry employed in this work , conversely to the spherical one used by bylicki",
    ". as we will show , this set of parameters is consistent with a resonance energy around @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "figure  [ fig : one ] shows the variational eigenvalues and the exact ll as functions of the magnetic field strength @xmath43 .",
    "the spectrum in figure  [ fig : one ] was obtained using a basis set size @xmath44 .",
    "as can be appreciated , the eigenvalues are grouped in sets that are bounded between landau levels given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the azimuthal angular momentum ( in our case @xmath47 ) , and @xmath48 .",
    "a pair of landau levels delimits a region of the @xmath49 plane , in this zone the eigenvalues are parallel to the lower landau level , except for the appearance of avoided crossings .",
    "this particular feature is shown in figure  [ fig : one ] b ) .",
    "( color on - line ) the four panels show details of the variational spectrum and the landau levels .",
    "a ) the variational spectrum obtained with a basis set size @xmath50 .",
    "each black curve corresponds to a single eigenvalue and the red curves correspond to the exact landau levels .",
    "b ) this panel shows the zone around the second ll ( red solid line ) . it can be seen how the levels that cross above the second ll have several avoided crossings before they reach the third one .",
    "c ) this panel shows the difference between the lowest variational eigenvalues,@xmath51 , and the first ll , @xmath52 , _ vs. _ the magnetic field , for @xmath53 .",
    "when the difference is smaller than zero , @xmath54 crosses the first ll as can also be appreciated in panel a ) besides , when @xmath55 the corresponding eigenstate becomes localized .",
    "d ) the eigenvalues above the first ll . the figure shows clearly how the eigenvalues are , basically parallel to the ll and accumulate above it . ]",
    "as can be seen very clearly from figure  [ fig : one]d ) , the variational eigenvalues have the tendency to accumulate above the landau levels .",
    "this feature is similar to the eigenvalue accumulation observed above the continuum threshold of a two - electron quantum dot @xcite .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied , each landau level works as the bottom of a continuum .",
    "another salient feature of the spectrum appears for large enough magnetic fields : one isolated eigenvalue with lower energy than the lowest landau level . from a physical point of view",
    ", the origin of this state can be understood as follows : for intermediate values of the magnetic fields the wave function of the electron looks like an harmonic oscillator wave function in the @xmath56 plane and as a free particle in the @xmath0 direction .",
    "the spatial extent of the wave function on the plane is roughly equivalent to the radius of a landau level , that is larger than the radius ( in the plane ) of the quantum dot .",
    "when the strength of the magnetic field is increased the radius of the lowest landau level becomes smaller and smaller reaching , at some point , a size similar to the radius of the quantum dot , at this point the state becomes localized . as we will show , the mechanism of localization can be quantified and strongly influences the behaviour of the resonance states whose energy lies near the localization point , in particular this mechanism is responsible of the binding of the resonance for large enough magnetic field @xcite , we will be back to this point in section  [ sec : localization ] .    the similarities between the behaviour of the spectrum analyzed in figure  [ fig : one ] near the point where @xmath57 , and the spectrum of a two - electron quantum dot near the ionization threshold are striking .",
    "so , it comes as no surprise that the resonance states of both models also show some similarities , as we will show later on .",
    "the calculation of the energy and width of resonance states offers a number of challenges that repeatedly leads to the formulation of new methods . among the most widely used methods",
    "can be mentioned the complex scaling ( or complex dilation ) method @xcite , the complex absorbing potential method @xcite and the density of states method @xcite .",
    "each one of these has its advantages and drawbacks .",
    "because we are dealing with a piecewise potential we resort to the exterior complex scaling ( see , for example , reference  @xcite ) .",
    "this method is particularly appealing in our case since for @xmath58 , the complex scaling should be applied only to the @xmath0 variable because this is the only direction available to the electron to get away from the bounding potential .",
    "the _ exterior _ of the method refers to the exterior of the region where the potential is not zero so , for @xmath58 the exterior complex scaling asks that @xmath59 where @xmath0 is the coordinate to be complex scaled , and @xmath60 is the rotation angle .",
    "the complex scaling turns the resonance states into normalizable states ( with a different norm ) which can be analyzed with the variational approach usually employed in hermitian problems , _",
    "i.e. _ the energy and width of the resonance state can be obtained approximately as an isolated complex eigenvalue of a finite ( complex ) hamiltonian , if @xmath61 is the complex scaled hamiltonian , then we get a complex variational eigenvalue problem @xmath62 where the entries of the matrix @xmath63 are given by @xmath64 another advantage of the complex scaling method is given by the similarities between the matrix elements in equation  [ elemacomplex ] with the ones calculated in equation  [ elemareal ] .     the real and imaginary parts of the resonance eigenvalue @xmath65 _ vs _ the magnetic field strength .",

    "if @xmath67 , or @xmath68 , the convergence of the method is , at least , questionable , see figure  [ fig : three ] . for small fields",

    "again , this structure can be attributed to role that each ll plays as the bottom of a continuum of levels .",
    "effectively , the distance between the origins of each set of lines , over the real axis , is exactly equal to the distance between the ll at the magnetic field strength considered . as the magnetic field strength decreases , the data of the different fans overlaps making very difficult to distinguish the eigenvalues corresponding to the resonance .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    it is worth to mention that despite the variational eigenvalues do not show any sudden changes near @xmath96 t , except for the lowest one when it crosses the first ll , the probability of localization into the well shows a well defined maximum for a large number of eigenvalues .    for small values of the magnetic field , the probability of localization @xmath97 and is a very smooth function of @xmath43 .",

    "since we are approximating the exact solutions of the eigenvalue problem with square - integrable functions , the value of the localization probability can not drop to zero , in the continuum region and far away from a resonance state , the variational eigenfunctions resemble a plane wave that is extended in a cylindrical spatial region with radius @xmath100 and length @xmath101 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the non - linear variational parameters . for this reason , in the continuum region and far away from a resonance , we estimate the localization probability as @xmath102 .",

    "the avoided crossings originated by this collision can be clearly appreciated in figure  [ fig : one]c ) , and reinforces the interpretation that the binding of the resonance is produced when a bounded state appears for large enough magnetic field . in this sense , the resonance state behaves as a shape resonance and the radial potential owed to the magnetic field is the one changing its shape .",

    "the localization probability critical field ( red squared dots , ) and the fidelity critical field ( solid black dots , ) data is shown for several quantum dot radius . the ( blue ) dashed curve correspond to the radius of the lowest ll as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "it is clear that for small quantum dot radius the localization takes place when the cylindrical wave function enters into the cylindrical qd . for larger qd s radius",
    "the localization is dominated by the quantum well potential and not by the magnetic field . ]    at this point , we can summarize our results in figure  [ fig : seven ] .",
    "the figure shows the energy of the resonant state as a function of @xmath43 , as it is obtained from the complex rotation , fidelity and localization methods .",
    "the resonance energy @xmath85 calculated using the three methods depicted in the text , complex exterior scaling , localization probability , fidelity , the corresponding values are shown using blue square dots ( ) , black circles ( ) , and magenta diamonds ( ) .",
    "the energy of the resonance in the region above the second ll can be obtained using a modified version of the complex rotation method and is shown using blue open squares ( ) . ]    from figure  [ fig : seven ] is rather clear that both the localization method and the fidelity are able to follow the resonance from the localization point until the second landau level .",
    "anyway , a word of caution is necessary here .",
    "the complex rotation method implies a stabilization procedure that , when properly used , gives an idea about the accuracy of the results obtained .",
    "this is not true for the fidelity method .",
    "the best recipe to obtain stabilized results from the fidelity method implies picking the largest possible basis set size , @xmath18 , with @xmath131 .",
    "otherwise , the convergence of the fidelity data , _",
    "i.e _ the values obtained for the resonance s energy from the fidelity , is not uniform .",
    "figure  [ fig : sevenp ] shows the behaviour of the resonance energy obtained following the fidelity method with different basis set sizes .",
    "it is worth to mention that the resonance energies obtained with @xmath132 and @xmath133 differ in less than 5@xmath134    again , as is the case with the localization probability method to find estimations for the resonance energy , the fidelity method works properly as long as the resonance state is well isolated , _ i.e. _ the only avoided crossings present in a given region of the spectrum should be one associated to the resonance . as has been said previously , above the second ll there is a very large number of avoided - crossings for each eigenvalue .",
    "owed to a multiple - continua scenario .",
    "each @xmath120 has a peak associated to every single avoided - crossing , making extremely hard to decide which peak corresponds to the resonance state .",
    "@xmath128 _ vs _ the magnetic field strength .",
    "the figure shows the data obtained using different basis set sizes , @xmath135 , triangle up open dots ; @xmath136 , square open dots ; @xmath137 , diamond open dots ; and @xmath138 , solid dots . ]",
    "the external magnetic field precludes the escape of the electron on the @xmath56 plane , for this reason the quantum dot bounding potential consists of a potential well and a potential step , to ensure the presence of resonance states . in this sense ,",
    "the problem has several characteristic lengths , the quantum dot radius , the landau levels radii , the length of the quantum dot along the @xmath0 axis , and so on .",
    "the two lengths that come into play varying the magnetic field strength , for the set of parameters considered in this work , are the quantum dot radius and the lowest ll radius .",
    "the potential well depth and the other parameters of the qd were chosen to ensure that for @xmath42 there were no bound states .",
    "the localization probability is able to track down the resonance states from the localization point up to the second ll . above the second ll the eigenvalues have too many avoided crossings , because of the multiple - continua interacting in this region of the spectrum , rendering the method useless .",
    "the many avoided crossings also prevent the use of the fidelity to detect the resonance above the second ll .",
    "moreover , despite that the width of the resonance state analyzed is not small when compared with the resonance energy , the fidelity method provides a good estimation of the last .",
    "anyway , some precaution must be exercised to obtain accurate and stable results .",
    "finally , both critical fields , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , show two clearly distinguishable regimes , for small quantum dot radius their values are given by the lowest landau level radius , so both are proportional to @xmath139 . for large enough quantum dot radius",
    "both critical fields show a different behaviour and , apparently , both are proportional to @xmath140 , where @xmath141 y @xmath142 are constants . the extent of the small field regime can be tuned changing the parameters of the bounding potential , equation  [ eq : potential ] , extending or reducing it .",
    "the critical behaviour of the eigenvalues in the transition region between the large field - small quantum dot radius and the small field - large quantum dot radius will be analyzed elsewhere .",
    "we would like to acknowledge secyt - unc , conicet , and mincyt crdoba for partial financial support of this project .",
    "we would like to thank dr .",
    "pablo serra for helpful comments and the critical reading of this manuscript .",
    "it is convenient to separate the kinetic energy matrix elements in two contributions , one corresponding to the radial coordinate ,        the matrix element of the bounding potential can be factorized owed to its piecewise character and using that there is a potential barrier on the @xmath0 direction .",
    "we get that @xmath147 the barrier term is , obviously , proportional to @xmath5 , while the term proportional to @xmath7 corresponds to the matrix element of the potential well .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath148 and @xmath149 are given by @xmath150 and @xmath151 @xmath152 @xmath153 the matrix element of the magnetic field term reads as @xmath154"
