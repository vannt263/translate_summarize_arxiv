    "in this note , we discuss a possibility to discover the cp - violating effect in the leptonic sector @xcite at a neutrino factory .",
    "observation of cp - violation would imply the measurement of an imaginary part of the couplings in the lagrangian associated with leptons @xcite .",
    "there are two ways to study cp violation .",
    "they are    \\1 . to study a difference between the cp conjugate modes , or    \\2 . to study a difference between the t conjugate modes",
    "the first method is to observe the difference between the particle and its anti - particle . in a neutrino factory",
    ", it can be studied by comparing the difference of the appearance event rates between @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that the matter effect would introduce a sizeable fake cp - odd effect @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to discriminate the genuine cp violation effect from the fake matter effect .",
    "the second method is to observe the difference between the transitions @xmath0 and @xmath2 . by the cpt theorem , in vacuum , observation of t - violation",
    "is identical to observation of cp - violation . even in a terrestrial oscillation experiment ,",
    "since a possible t - odd effect from asymmetric matter density profile in the earth is very small @xcite , this t - reversed difference reveals as a very clean signal @xcite on the imaginary phase in the lepton sector @xcite .",
    "therefore , the comparison of t - reversed oscillation modes would give clear signature than those of cp - reversed oscillation modes .",
    "however , although it is easy to observe @xmath3 oscillation , it is known to be difficult to observe @xmath4 oscillation at a neutrino factory .",
    "the reason is as follows . at a neutrino factory ,",
    "@xmath5 is generated by the decay of muons as well as @xmath6 .",
    "the former after the oscillation from @xmath7 , produces @xmath8s and the latter from muon decays produces @xmath9s at a detector .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish @xmath10 from @xmath11 after the creation of electromagnetic shower in most of the detectors being considered at present .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to identify the oscillation events from the non - oscillation events which is larger in statistics .",
    "it is critical to examine whether there are any solutions to solve this problem for the search for t - violation modes useful .",
    "there was one idea to identify the oscillation events by the use of polarized muons in the muon storage ring @xcite .",
    "the principle of the idea is the following .",
    "supposed that the muons in the muon storage ring have their spin polarization @xmath12 , there would be no @xmath13 and only @xmath14 at the very forward direction along the muon momentum direction .",
    "observation of @xmath15like events at a detector would directly imply the appearance of @xmath16 .",
    "in reality , the muon spin polarization would not be 100 % .",
    "but , if the spin polarization of the muons in the muon storage ring can be changed , accordingly the neutrino energy spectrum shapes can be changed .",
    "the changes of the spectrum of neutrino and anti - neutrino are different .",
    "therefore , in principle we could discriminate the events associated with neutrinos from those from anti - neutrino . in turn",
    ", the oscillating events and non - oscillating events can be separated .",
    "in this section , the principle to discriminate the oscillating events by using the muon polarization is presented .",
    "the neutrino flux in the very forward direction of a @xmath17 beam with its muon spin polarization @xmath18 is given by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the @xmath17 energy and @xmath22 is the neutrino energy . for @xmath23 , eqs.([nu_eflux ] ) and ( [ nu_muflux ] ) can be given with changing the sign of @xmath18 . from using eqs.([nu_eflux ] ) and ( [ nu_muflux ] ) , the non - oscillating event rate of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and the appearance event rate of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) are given by    @xmath28    respectively . here",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the event numbers corresponding to each term of neutrino flux .",
    "they are typically represented by @xmath32    where @xmath33 , @xmath34 are oscillation probabilities , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the detection rate including the neutrino ( anti - neutrino ) cross section and signal efficiency , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is minimum ( maximum ) neutrino energy observed in this assumption , @xmath39 is the baseline length , and @xmath40 is the constant proportionate to the decay muon number and the detector mass . from these equations ,",
    "the rate of @xmath15like events , which is the sum of @xmath41 and @xmath27 , can be given by    @xmath42    note that for @xmath43 , @xmath44 becomes equal to @xmath27 itself from eq.([nu_eevent ] ) .",
    "the estimate of the @xmath15like event rate at @xmath43 is essentially the measurement of @xmath27 . in another words ,",
    "if @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be estimated , the direct observation of @xmath27 could be made in principle .",

    "what we have to calculate numerically is the extrapolated value at @xmath43 which indeed coincides with the theoretical expectation value @xmath79 and the variance of it which is actually given by eq.([estimatevbar ] ) .",

    "select several values of the polarization @xmath47 for the measurements , 2 .",
    "fix all the parameters , such as the theoretical parameters ( e.g. mixing angle ) , a muon energy and so on , and then calculate the expectation of event rates in each polarization values ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "3 .   generate the `` actual '' events of @xmath51 according to poisson distribution with its expectation value @xmath54 4 .",
    "substitute these event sets into eqs.([estimatebeta0 ] ) , ( [ estimatebeta1 ] ) , and find the extrapolated value at @xmath43 from eq.([estimatenbar ] ) by using these @xmath70 s .",
    "5 .   iterate the step 2 and step 3 in several times to find the type of distribution of the extrapolated value .",
    "this virtual measurements for various parameters were made .",
    "it is found that the extrapolated value follows the normal distribution with its mean value @xmath80 and its variance given by eq.([estimatevbar ] ) .",

    "the most efficient ratio , @xmath111 , between the numbers of @xmath110 @xmath112 and @xmath17 @xmath113 to obtain the best sensitivity to cp violation is estimated for a fixed distribution of @xmath114 at each polarization @xmath47 . to do this",

    "since the oscillation probability is at most a few % , while @xmath76 in eq.([estimatevbar ] ) is essentially given by the non - oscillation event , from the fact that @xmath124 and that @xmath125/\\sum_i [ ( { p_{\\mu}}_i^*)^2/(f_i^2 y_i)]$ ] in eq.([estimatevbar ] ) is much larger than a unity in a realistic case , it is found that a much larger number of @xmath17 is needed .",
