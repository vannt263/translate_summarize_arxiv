    "scientists around the world are striving toward the construction of a scalable quantum computer .",
    "theorists can contribute to this effort by developing and optimizing methods for protecting quantum computers against environmental decoherence and systematic hardware imperfections .",
    "indeed , the theory of quantum fault tolerance @xcite has established that reliable quantum computation is possible if the noise afflicting the computer has suitable properties .",
    "the most obvious requirement is that the noise must be sufficiently weak  if the noise strength is below a _ threshold of accuracy _ then quantum computing is scalable in principle .",
    "recent insights have led to steadily improving estimates of the accuracy threshold , boosting confidence that large - scale quantum computers will be realized eventually .",
    "notably , knill proposed a scheme for fault - tolerant quantum computation based on concatenated error - detecting codes and postselection , in which ancilla states are prepared off - line and an ancilla is discarded whenever an error is detected during its preparation .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that knill s scheme can tolerate independent stochastic noise with an error probability per gate of about @xmath2 @xcite , and a threshold error rate of order @xmath3 has been rigorously established @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the overhead cost of knill s postselection scheme is discouraging because ancillas are rarely accepted .",
    "however , knill also proposed a modified version of the scheme with a more moderate overhead cost , which we call the `` fibonacci scheme . ''",
    "the fibonacci scheme is based on the observation that a distance-2 code , aside from detecting errors , can also correct errors that occur at known positions in the code block ; thus , in a concatenated code , detected errors at one coding level become _ located _ errors that can be corrected at the next level up .",
    "( we call it the fibonacci scheme because the probability of a logical error scales with the coding level @xmath4 like @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the noise strength and @xmath7 is a fibonacci sequence . )",
    "knill s numerical simulations indicate that the fibonacci scheme , too , can tolerate independent stochastic noise with an error rate of about @xmath2 @xcite .    in this paper , we provide a rigorous analysis of the fibonacci scheme .",
    "our main result is a lower bound on the accuracy threshold for the fibonacci scheme that is of the same order as the lower bound found earlier for knill s postselection scheme .",
    "thus our result proves that a high accuracy threshold can be compatible with a moderate overhead cost , supporting knill s numerical findings .",
    "the fibonacci scheme has some features in common with fault - tolerant schemes used in previous proofs of the quantum threshold theorem , but there are also important differences , and correspondingly our new threshold proof has a rather different structure than these previous proofs . as in previous schemes , logical qubits processed by the computer are protected from damage using a quantum code , and encoded gates are realized by gadgets that act on the code blocks and correct the errors . but",
    "standard versions of the quantum threshold theorem are based on concatenated coding and recursive simulations .",
    "the code block of a concatenated code is constructed as a hierarchy of codes within codes  the code block at level @xmath4 of this hierarchy is built from logical qubits encoded at level @xmath8 of the hierarchy .",
    "likewise , in a recursive simulation , fault - tolerant gadgets are constructed as a hierarchy of gadgets within gadgets  the gadgets at level @xmath4 are built from gadgets at level @xmath8 .",
    "this recursive construction streamlines the analysis ; if the level-1 simulation of an ideal circuit is more reliable than an unprotected `` level-0 '' circuit , then because of the self - similarity of the gadgets , the level-2 simulation will be still more reliable , and so on .",
    "in contrast , though the fibonacci scheme uses concatenated coding , the construction of gadgets is not strictly recursive ; rather , the logical controlled - not ( cnot ) gates and encoded measurements are implemented transversally at all levels of the concatenated code .",
    "that is , a logical cnot gate is performed by executing many fundamental cnot gates in parallel in a single time step , and encoded measurements are performed by measuring many qubits in parallel in a single time step , followed by classical decoding of the measurement outcomes .",
    "errors are corrected by means of quantum teleportation , using encoded bell pairs that _ are _ prepared recursively , and the analysis of the recursive bell pair preparation procedure is the crux of our proof . for the scheme to succeed ,",
    "it is essential that the errors in an encoded bell pair are only weakly correlated ; our central task is to formalize a notion of `` weakly correlated '' that makes the proof work , and to show that the encoded bell pairs really have this property at each level of concatenation .",
    "a second distinctive feature of the fibonacci scheme , as already mentioned , is that a concatenated error-_detecting _ code is used to correct _ located _ errors .",
    "the _ classical _ decoding of a measured code block is performed recursively , starting at the lowest level ; a subblock is flagged if an error is detected in the subblock , and at each level , if an error is detected in a block that has only one flagged subblock , then the flagged subblock is corrected . in principle , flagging detected errors and constructing non - recursive gadgets are independent ideas ",
    "we could use flagging in a recursive scheme or use non - recursive gadgets without flagging .",
    "however , following knill , we have found that combining flagging and non - recursive gadget construction gives an especially high threshold estimate at a moderate overhead cost .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : noise - model ] , we define the correlated `` local stochastic '' noise model that we consider in most of our analysis .",
    "( our arguments also apply to uncorrelated pauli noise models , and yield a slightly better lower bound on the accuracy threshold in that case . ) in section [ sec : scheme ] , we formulate the fibonacci scheme for simulating a quantum circuit , and present gadgets for error correction and logical gates based on a concatenated 4-qubit code ; then in section [ sec : decoding ] we define our procedure for decoding the measurement of a code block . in sections [ sec : level - reduction ] and [ sec : css - gadgets ] ,",
    "we derive recursion relations that characterize the error correlations in recursively prepared bell pairs and the failure probability of gadgets for @xmath9 operations ; this is the technical heart of our proof . in section [ sec : css - threshold ] , we obtain a lower bound on the accuracy threshold for @xmath9 operations , and we extend it to a complete universal set of fault - tolerant quantum gates in section [ sec : threshold ] .",
    "we discuss the overhead cost of the fibonacci scheme in section [ sec : overhead ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we use the term _ location _ to speak of an operation in a quantum circuit that is performed in a single time step ; a location may be a single - qubit or multi - qubit gate , a qubit preparation step , a qubit measurement , or the identity operation in the case of a qubit that is idle during the time step . in a stochastic noise model",
    ", we assume that at each circuit location either the ideal operation is executed perfectly or else a fault occurs , and we assign a probability to each _",
    "fault path_that is , to each possible set of faulty locations in the circuit .",
    "we speak of _ local stochastic noise _ with strength @xmath6 if , for any @xmath10 specified locations in the circuit , the sum of the probabilities of all fault paths with faults at those @xmath10 locations is no larger than @xmath11 .",
    "for each fault path , the trace - preserving quantum operation applied at the faulty locations is arbitrary and can be chosen adversarially ; therefore in this noise model the faults can be correlated both temporally and spatially .",
    "however , we will exclude `` leakage '' faults in which quantum information escapes from the computational space .    in the fibonacci scheme ,",
    "errors are corrected by teleportation , and logical errors occur if the bell measurements in the noisy circuit fail to simulate correctly the bell measurements in the ideal circuit",
    ". we will analyze the effectiveness of the scheme by propagating errors forward to the measurements , in order to estimate the failure probability for the measurement of encoded blocks .",
    "this error propagation is feasible because qubits are always measured just a few time steps after they are initially prepared .    for each fault path",
    ", the operation @xmath12 acting at the faulty locations can be expressed in terms of a set @xmath13 of nontrivial kraus operators , and each kraus operator has a pauli expansion @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes a tensor product of pauli spin operators @xmath16 that act at the faulty locations . each pauli operator can be propagated forward in time through the ideal circuit .",
    "thus , for each fault path and for each time @xmath17 , we obtain a trace - preserving completely positive map @xmath18 acting on the qubits at time @xmath17 , where each kraus operator in @xmath18 also has a pauli expansion . for any qubit labeled @xmath19",
    "we will say that the operation @xmath12 causes a `` type - x '' error acting on @xmath19 at time @xmath17 if any pauli operator in the expansion of @xmath18 contains either @xmath20 or @xmath21 acting on @xmath19 ; similarly we say that @xmath12 causes a `` type - z '' error acting on @xmath19 at time @xmath17 if any pauli operator in the expansion of @xmath18 contains either @xmath22 or @xmath21 acting on @xmath19 .",
    "thus , if @xmath19 is measured at time @xmath17 , then @xmath12 generates a measurement error with nonzero probability if the measurement is in the z basis and there is a type - x error , or if the measurement is in the x basis and there is a type - z error .",
    "we will assume that our quantum computer is equipped to execute elementary operations chosen from the universal set @xmath23 here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the measurement of the single - qubit pauli operators @xmath22 and @xmath20 respectively and @xmath26 denotes the preparation of the single - qubit state @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . to prove our threshold theorem ,",
    "first we will show that there is an accuracy threshold @xmath31 for operations in @xmath9if @xmath32 then _ encoded _",
    "@xmath9 operations can be simulated to any desired accuracy . then we will show that for @xmath32 , by using the reliable encoded @xmath9 operations and the noisy elementary operations @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we can distill accurately encoded copies of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , thus completing a universal set of reliable encoded operations .    in the fibonacci scheme , operations in @xmath37 will be protected using the code @xmath38 , the 4-qubit code @xmath39 concatenated @xmath4 times .",
    "( knill actually proposed to concatenate @xmath39 with a 6-qubit code @xmath40 in order to reduce the overhead @xcite , but we will analyze a simpler scheme that uses @xmath39 only . )",
    "the code @xmath39 has distance 2 and its check operators are @xmath41 and @xmath42 . though the code space is four dimensional , we will use only one of the two encoded qubits to protect the quantum information processed by the computer .",
    "the encoded pauli operators acting on this `` logical '' qubit are @xmath43 while the encoded pauli operators acting on the irrelevant `` gauge '' qubit are @xmath44 we do not care about the state of the gauge qubit , and therefore a @xmath22 error acting on the third qubit in the code block is equivalent to a @xmath22 error acting on the fourth qubit  the errors differ by the gauge - qubit operator @xmath45 , which commutes with the logical pauli operators .",
    "likewise , @xmath22 errors on the first and second qubits are equivalent , as are @xmath20 errors on the first and third qubits or @xmath20 errors on the second and fourth qubits .",
    "we will derive our lower bound on @xmath31 by showing that , for @xmath46 , `` gadgets '' realizing encoded @xmath9 operations protected by @xmath38 become highly reliable as @xmath4 increases .",
    "how are these gadgets constructed ?",
    "first , consider the @xmath9 gadgets protected by @xmath39 ( the case @xmath47 ) .",
    "the cnot gadget , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , consists of a transversal logical cnot gate , together with error recovery steps on each block that precede and follow the transversal gate .",
    "the other @xmath9 gadgets are smaller and more reliable than the cnot gadget , so to obtain a lower bound on the @xmath9 threshold it suffices to study the cnot gadget .",
    "inside all gadgets , error recovery is achieved by logical teleportation using bell pairs encoded in @xmath39 .",
    "the encoded bell pairs ( 1-bps ) are prepared by using unencoded bell pairs ( 0-bps ) and cnot gates as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . the preparation circuit must be designed carefully to control correlated errors .",
    "we do not need to worry about correlated errors in the 0-bps  any two - qubit error acting on the bell state @xmath48 is equivalent to a one - qubit error , because @xmath49 is invariant under @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "on the other hand , error correlations between the two blocks of the 1-bp might cause trouble , and can arise from a single fault in the transversal cnot gate shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) .",
    "a simple way to suppress correlated errors is to follow the preparation of the 1-bp with the teleportation of both blocks , using two other 1-bps as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) . using this circuit ,",
    "an error occurs in an output block only if there is a fault in the teleportation of the block ; therefore , errors in different blocks must arise from distinct faults .     the gadget for a cnot gate protected by @xmath39 .",
    "a transversal cnot gate , which implements the logical cnot gate acting on two blocks , is preceded and followed by logical teleportations which extract the code s error syndrome .",
    "arrows denote cnot gates , with the arrow tip pointing to the target qubit .",
    "green and blue triangles pointing to the left denote @xmath25 and @xmath24 respectively , and bell pairs encoded in @xmath39 ( 1-bps ) are prepared as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . , width=313 ]     ( a ) preparation of an unencoded bell pair ( 0-bp ) where green and blue triangles pointing to the right denote @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "( b ) a bell pair encoded in @xmath39 ( 1-bp ) is constructed by preparing one block in the logical @xmath54 state , a second block in the logical @xmath55 state , and applying transversal cnot gates .",
    "( c ) the two blocks of a 1-bp are teleported , using two other 1-bps , in order to limit correlations between errors in different output blocks . depending on the measurement outcomes ,",
    "logical pauli operators ( not shown ) acting on the two output blocks may be needed to complete the teleportations .",
    ", width=313 ]    one way to construct the gadget for the cnot gate encoded in @xmath56 would be to replace every elementary cnot gate in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] by the cnot gadget encoded in @xmath39 . and by repeating this replacement recursively , we could obtain the `` level-@xmath4 '' gadget for the cnot gate encoded in @xmath38 for any @xmath57 .",
    "however , in the fibonacci scheme we do _ not _ follow this recursive procedure to construct the higher - level gadgets . instead ,",
    "for each @xmath4 the logical cnot gate inside the level-@xmath4 cnot gadget is performed transversally in a single time step just as in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , and the measurements of encoded blocks are also transversal .",
    "we construct the higher - level gadgets using this non - recursive method because we have found that it yields a significantly better lower bound on the accuracy threshold than a strictly recursive procedure . on the other hand , the level-@xmath4 bell pair ( @xmath4-bp ) inside the level-@xmath4 cnot gadget _",
    "is _ constructed recursively .",
    "that is , just as the 1-bp preparation circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) , constructed from transversal level-1 cnot gates and measurements , operates on twelve input 0-bps , so the @xmath4-bp preparation circuit , constructed from level-@xmath4 transversal cnot gates and measurements , acts on twelve input @xmath58-bps .",
    "but this circuit for preparing a @xmath4-bp still has a flaw that must be addressed  for @xmath4 large",
    ", each output qubit of the @xmath4-bp goes unmeasured for many time steps , gradually accumulating errors .",
    "let us say that the final step in the @xmath4-bp preparation circuit , the level-@xmath4 transversal cnot gate acting on the output blocks , occurs in time step @xmath4 .",
    "this transversal cnot follows @xmath58-bp preparations that are completed in time step @xmath8 .",
    "thus , there are level-@xmath58 transversal cnot gates in time step @xmath8 , which are preceded by @xmath59-bp preparations that are completed in time step @xmath60 , and so on .",
    "we see that each of the output qubits of the @xmath4-bp is acted on by cnot gates in consecutive time steps 1 through @xmath4 . but during these @xmath4 steps nothing is being done to correct the errors in these qubits .",
    "we can correct this flaw by adding one more ingredient to the scheme ; for @xmath57 we replace the circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) , by the circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . in this modified circuit ,",
    "after a @xmath4-bp is prepared , we teleport every output @xmath61 subblock by using additional @xmath58-bps . in the modified @xmath4-bp preparation circuit , then , the last step is a @xmath58-bp preparation acting on the subblocks . in turn ,",
    "the last step in the @xmath58-bp preparation is a @xmath59-bp preparation , the last step in the @xmath59-bp preparation is a @xmath62-bp preparation , and so on .",
    "thus , the output qubits from the circuit actually emerge directly from 1-bps , and there is no accumulation of error to worry about .",
    "( a ) the complete preparation circuit for a @xmath4-bp where @xmath57 .",
    "it is identical to the circuit shown in fig .",

    "( b ) the teleportation circuit .",
    ", width=309 ]    to determine the effectiveness of this scheme , where errors are corrected by logical teleportation , we need to estimate the probability of failure when a @xmath38 code block is measured .",
    "measurements are performed transversally  to measure the encoded @xmath20 , we measure all qubits in the block simultaneously in the x basis , and to measure the encoded @xmath22 , we measure all qubits in the block simultaneously in the z basis",
    ". then these measurement outcomes are decoded using a classical recursive algorithm that is assumed to be noiseless .",
    "first , the @xmath39 subblocks are decoded , then the @xmath56 subblocks , _",
    "etc_. , up to the final @xmath38 block . at each level @xmath63 ,",
    "the decoding of a @xmath64 block makes use of the error syndrome computed in the previous step during the decoding of its four @xmath65 subblocks . specifically , whenever we detect an error in a @xmath65 subblock for @xmath66 , we _ flag _ this subblock to indicate that the decoding of the subblock has an enhanced probability of failure .",
    "then , if a @xmath67 block has a nontrivial error syndrome and a single flagged subblock , we decode the @xmath67 block under the assumption that the flagged subblock was decoded incorrectly .    at the top level",
    ", an error might be detected in the decoding of the final @xmath38 block that can not be corrected ( either because no @xmath61 subblock is flagged , or because more than one subblock is flagged ) .",
    "if such an uncorrectable error is found at the top level in the recursive preparation of an encoded bell pair , then the preparation is aborted . on the other hand ,",
    "if such an uncorrectable error is detected at a measurement s top level in the teleportation step inside a gadget , then the code has failed to protect the measurement effectively .",
    "we will prove that , for sufficiently weak noise , the probability of detecting an error in the final decoding step of a @xmath38 block decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "thus the overhead cost due to aborting and restarting the preparation of encoded bell pairs is moderate ; the preparation of a @xmath4-bps is rarely aborted once @xmath4 is large .",
    "furthermore , the probability of a logical error inside a level-@xmath4 gadget becomes arbitrarily small for @xmath4 sufficiently large .",
    "now we will specify in more detail the ( noiseless ) classical algorithm for decoding measurements of code blocks , and we will discuss the effectiveness of this algorithm . under appropriate assumptions about the noise in the measurements , we would like to estimate how the probability of error and the probability of flagging propagates from level to level as the block is recursively decoded .    at each level of the recursive decoding ,",
    "we are to interpret a 4-bit string corresponding to the measured eigenvalues of the encoded @xmath20 or the encoded @xmath22 in the four @xmath65 subblocks of a @xmath67 block , where some of the bits might be flagged .",
    "the decoder knows which bits are flagged , but of course it does not know which bits have errors .",
    "we may consider a joint distribution that governs the probability of error and the probability of flagging for the four bits .",
    "for each measurement in the fibonacci simulation , and for each level of the concatenated code , this distribution is completely determined in principle by the decoding procedure at lower levels and by the noise model .",
    "that is , if we know the probability of each fault path and the noise operation associated with each fault path , we can propagate the errors forward ( as described in section [ sec : noise - model ] ) to determine an error model for the measured block . then using this error model and the decoding procedure , we can assign a probability ( or at least an upper bound on the probability ) for each nontrivial pattern of flagging and errors at each decoding level .    to prove our threshold theorem",
    ", we will need to show that the decoding errors at each concatenation level are only weakly correlated . a suitable notion of weakly correlated , which we call `` quasi - independence",

    "let @xmath73 and @xmath74 denote disjoint subsets of @xmath69 containing @xmath10 bits and @xmath75 bits respectively , and let @xmath76 denote a subset of @xmath74 containing @xmath77 bits .",

    "we say that @xmath80 is the error strength for unflagged bits , @xmath81 is the error strength for flagged bits , and @xmath82 is the flagging strength .    when applied to the decoding of @xmath83 , the errors of interest are @xmath20 errors ; hence quasi - independence constrains how @xmath20 errors are correlated with one another .",
    "likewise , when applied to the decoding of @xmath84 , quasi - independence constrains how the @xmath22 errors are correlated with one another .",
    "but we will not need to know much about how @xmath20 errors are correlated with @xmath22 errors to analyze the failure probability for measurements of encoded blocks .",

    "first , let us formulate precisely our algorithm for flagging a @xmath39 block :    @xmath87 if no bit in the block is flagged , then we flag the block whenever the syndrome is non - trivial , @xmath88 if exactly one bit in the block is flagged , then we _ never _ flag the block , @xmath89 if two or more bits in the block are flagged , then we flag the block if errors on a pair of flagged bits can cause a logical error .    in case @xmath87 , we flag the block because we have detected an error that we do not know how to correct . in case @xmath88 , rather than flagging the block , we perform error correction ( in the event of a nontrivial syndrome ) under the assumption that the flagged bit has an error . in case @xmath89 , we do not flag the block if errors at the flagged bits would affect only the gauge qubit , not the logical qubit .    given this flagging algorithm and assuming quasi - independent errors on the bits , we can see that the @xmath39 blocks also have quasi - independent errors .",

    "now we have shown that , if @xmath6 is sufficiently small , @xmath9 gates can be simulated with arbitrarily good accuracy . to complete our proof of a quantum accuracy threshold theorem based on the fibonacci scheme , we must extend this protected gate set to a universal set .",

    "the level-@xmath4 encoded bell pair can be prepared reliably if @xmath6 is below the @xmath9 threshold and @xmath4 is large .",
    "but the teleportation procedure could fail either because there is an error in the recursively decoded state , or because a fault occurs in the preparation of @xmath93 or in the two - qubit bell - measurement circuit .",

    "each encoded cnot gate is followed by error - correcting teleportation steps acting on both output blocks .",
    "we abort the `` teleportation into the block '' protocol if , at any stage of decoding the @xmath38 block , a flag is raised in the top - level decoding of a measurement inside any error - correcting teleportation .",

    "it is possible by using our recursion equations to prove that if the fundamental noise strength @xmath6 is below the @xmath9 accuracy threshold , then , for all @xmath4 , @xmath98 is bounded above by @xmath99 for local stochastic noise and @xmath100 for independent depolarizing noise .",
    "thus , in both cases encoded ancilla states can be prepared with a probability of error below the distillation threshold , and robust universal quantum computation is possible .",

    "the overhead factor @xmath115 is polylogarithmic in @xmath114 because , although the number of locations inside a level-@xmath4 gadget grows approximately exponentially with the level of concatenation @xmath4 , the probability of a logical error in a level-@xmath4 gadget decreases _",
    "double exponentially _ with @xmath4 , if @xmath6 is less than the threshold value @xmath110 .    for the fibonacci scheme ,",
    "the probability of a ( flagged ) logical error at level @xmath4 scales with @xmath4 according to eq .",
    "( [ flagged - failure - scaling ] ) : @xmath116 we can simulate a circuit of size @xmath114 with reasonable accuracy if the probability of a logical error per gate is of order @xmath117 , or @xmath118 if the size of the largest level-@xmath4 gadget is bounded above by @xmath119 ( where @xmath120 is a constant ) , then the overhead factor can be expressed as @xmath121 this is polylogarithmic scaling as asserted in theorem 1 .    to examine in more detail how the gadget size depends on @xmath4",
    ", we must take into account that our procedure for preparing a @xmath4-bp uses _ postselection _ : the @xmath4-bp is rejected if a flag is raised at the top level in either one of the two block teleportations or in any one of the eight subblock teleportations .",
    "thus the probability of rejection scales with @xmath4 like the probability of a top - level flag in a level-@xmath58 block , which is @xmath122 according to eqs .",
    "( [ flag - strength - scaling ] ) and ( [ flagged - failure - scaling ] ) . for the purpose of estimating the overhead",
    ", we may imagine that a constant number ( independent of @xmath4 ) of @xmath4-bp preparations are executed in parallel , where the constant is chosen to be large enough so that the probability that all of the @xmath4-bps are rejected is sufficiently small .",
    "for example , for each @xmath4-bp used in the level-@xmath4 cnot gadget , suppose that @xmath123 @xmath4-bps are prepared in parallel .",
    "the cnot gadget may fail because , in one of the @xmath4-bp preparations contained inside the gadget , all @xmath123 of the @xmath4-bps are rejected  this occurs with probability @xmath124 .",
    "the probability of a logical error in the cnot gadget arising from other sources is @xmath125 ; thus the probability of failure due to the rejection of all @xmath123 @xmath4-bps is comparable to other contributions to the failure probability if we choose @xmath126    similarly , for each input @xmath4-bp used in the preparation of a level-@xmath127 bp , suppose that @xmath128 @xmath4-bps are prepared in parallel .",
    "then the probability that all @xmath128 @xmath4-bps are rejected is @xmath129 . in this case",
    ", @xmath128 should be large enough that the probability of failure due to rejection of all the @xmath4-bps is comparable to the probability of an unflagged level-@xmath4 logical error in an accepted @xmath4-bp , which is @xmath130 according to eq .",
    "( [ unflagged - error - scaling ] )",
    ". therefore we choose @xmath131 the @xmath4-bp preparation circuit ( for @xmath57 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] uses as input 12 @xmath58-bps , plus another 8 @xmath58-bps for the final subblock teleportations . for our overhead estimate",
    ", we replace these 20 @xmath58-bp preparations by @xmath132 @xmath58-bp preparations .",
    "in addition , the @xmath4-bp preparation circuit contains 28 level-@xmath58 transversal logical cnot gates ( @xmath133 to prepare three level-@xmath4 bell pairs , @xmath134 for the two block teleportations , and @xmath134 for the eight subblock teleportations ) plus 32 level-@xmath58 transversal measurements ( @xmath135 for the two block teleportations and @xmath135 for the eight subblock teleportations ) .",
    "more generally , suppose that the preparation circuit for a @xmath4-bp ( @xmath136 ) uses @xmath10 @xmath58-bps , @xmath75 level-@xmath58 cnot gates and @xmath77 level-@xmath58 measurements .",
    "furthermore , suppose that the logical cnot gates and measurements are transversal , so that a level-@xmath4 logical cnot uses @xmath137 fundamental two - qubit cnot gates and a level-@xmath4 logical measurement uses @xmath137 fundamental single - qubit measurements , where @xmath70 is the block size of the code that is concatenated @xmath4 times ( @xmath138 for the scheme we have analyzed ) .",
    "let @xmath139 denote the number of @xmath140-bp preparations , @xmath141 denote the number of level-1 cnot gates , and @xmath142 denote the number of level-1 measurements contained in a level-@xmath4 bp preparation .",
    "these quantities obey the recursion relations : @xmath143 solving these recursion relations , we find @xmath144 assuming @xmath145 .",
    "these expressions illustrate how the number of locations inside a level-@xmath4 gadget grows roughly exponentially with @xmath4 , at least for the case of the @xmath9 gadgets .",
    "the distillation protocols that prepare high - fidelity encoded ancillas for non - clifford gates use @xmath9 gadgets , and require a number of rounds of that grows linearly with @xmath4 ; thus the circuit size for the non - clifford gadgets can also be bounded above by an exponential in @xmath4 .",
    "an important feature of the ( non - recursive ) fibonacci scheme , not shared by the strictly recursive schemes analyzed in @xcite , is that although the size @xmath113 of the noisy circuit is larger than the size @xmath114 of the ideal circuit by a factor polylogarithmic in @xmath114 , the `` quantum depth '' @xmath146 of the noisy circuit is larger than the depth @xmath147 of the ideal circuit by only a constant factor .",
    "( that is , the number of time steps in the simulation is larger than the number of time steps in the ideal computation by a constant factor , _ if _ we neglect the time required for classical processing of measurement outcomes . )    note that the preparation of bell pairs and the distillation of ancilla states are performed off - line and hence do not contribute to the simulation s depth .",
    "a transversal level-@xmath4 logical cnot gate can be executed in a single time step for any value of @xmath4 .",
    "the quantum measurements comprising the transversal measurement of a level-@xmath4 block can also be performed in a single time step , but to determine the outcome of the encoded measurement classical processing of the measurement outcomes is required , which can be executed by a classical circuit with depth linear in @xmath4 .    whenever a non - clifford gate is teleported , the outcome of the encoded measurement is needed to determine what clifford gate should be applied in the next step .",
    "if classical processing is much faster than quantum processing , then we may neglect the time needed for the classical decoding of measured blocks ; under this assumption , non - clifford gates as well as clifford gates can be simulated in constant depth .",
    "we will not present here a more detailed analysis of the resource requirements for the fibonacci scheme , but we note that estimates based on numerical simulations are discussed in the supplementary information in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we can expect the accuracy of quantum computing hardware to improve steadily .",
    "even so , overcoming the limiting effects of noise will pose a challenge to the builders of quantum computers well into the future , and fault - tolerant simulations will be needed to operate large - scale quantum computers reliably .",
    "there are two central questions about fault - tolerant schemes : how much noise can be tolerated and how does the overhead cost depend on the strength of the noise ?",
    "much can be learned about the answers to these questions through numerical studies of fault - tolerant circuits .",
    "but it is also useful to prove rigorous statements about the performance of fault - tolerant methods .",
    "for one thing , a long computation might fail due to rare noise fluctuations ; the probability of rare events could be seriously underestimated in numerical simulations , so that rigorous upper bounds on the probability are valuable .",
    "furthermore , rigorous analysis can deepen our conceptual understanding regarding which approaches to fault tolerance are most effective , and inspire new proposals for fault - tolerant circuit design .",
    "this paper , like the earlier paper @xcite , provides a rigorous analysis of a clever approach to quantum fault tolerance introduced by knill @xcite ; in @xcite we analyzed knill s `` postselection scheme '' and here we have analyzed his `` fibonacci scheme , '' which has a much more favorable overhead cost than the postselection scheme . in each case we have established a rigorous lower bound on the quantum accuracy threshold that is significantly higher than the previously proven lower bounds for other fault - tolerant schemes , though still about an order of magnitude below knill s numerical estimates .",
    "( high numerical estimates of the accuracy threshold have also been found in @xcite , though for that scheme a fully rigorous analysis has not yet been done . )    for the fibonacci scheme , our rigorous lower bound on the threshold noise strength @xmath110 is @xmath0 for local stochastic noise and @xmath1 for independent depolarizing noise .",
    "our previously derived lower bound for the postselection scheme was @xmath148 , but that result applies to a modified noise model with weaker noise correlations than local stochastic noise and stronger noise correlations than independent depolarizing noise .",
    "all of these results notably improve on the lower bound @xmath149 for local stochastic noise found earlier for the concatenated bacon - shor scheme @xcite .",
    "our proof of the threshold theorem uses some new methods that might be fruitfully applied elsewhere .",
    "we have introduced a new wrinkle on `` level reduction '' by characterizing the noise in recursively prepared bell pairs using a hierarchical effective circuit that produces the same output as the actual bell - pair preparation circuit .",
    "we have also developed tools for analyzing the recursive decoding of concatenated code blocks assisted by flags that point to probable error locations . in a separate paper , we have shown that flagging can be helpfully invoked in schemes designed to protect against highly biased noise models , where type - z errors are far more likely than type - x errors @xcite .",
    "this paper supersedes an earlier discussion @xcite where a recursive scheme which used flagging was studied .",
    "the analysis reported in @xcite was flawed , and the threshold estimate derived there was incorrect .",
