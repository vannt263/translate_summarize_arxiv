    "hd209458b is the first extra - solar giant planet ( egp ) observed to transit its parent star @xcite and , consequently , its mass ( 0.69 m@xmath0 ) and radius ( 1.35 r@xmath0 ) are known to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "these results leave little doubt that hd209458b is a gas giant . and",
    "its special orbital inclination has drawn a great deal of attention from observers and theorists over the past year .",
    "recently , an increase in the sodium absorption ( relative to the continuum ) at 5893was observed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) during several transits of hd2094598 @xcite .",
    "the additional sodium absorption is believed to be due to na d absorption in the egp s atmosphere as stellar light passes through the planetary limb .",
    "this observation marks a major turning point in the study of egps , for now we have direct evidence of an atmosphere around hd209458b and a measurement of one chemical species ( na ) . according to @xcite",
    ", the hst observations suggest that either the egp atmosphere has a low concentration of neutral atomic na ( due to photoionization , molecular formation , or an overall low metallicity ) or that high altitude clouds exist and reduce the amount of stellar flux transmitted though the egp limb .    in this letter , we offer an alternate explanation for the observed na absorption and explore the possibility that the na d feature is altered by nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) effects brought on by the impinging stellar radiation field and insufficient collisional thermalization .",
    "if true , nlte effects would offer a natural explanation for the apparently low sodium absorption observed in the hd209458b without the need for excessive ionization , a reduced metallicity , or extremely high altitude clouds .",
    "below we will present theoretical predictions for nlte na d doublet line profiles for the transmitted spectrum of an irradiated egp atmosphere and provide stringent limits on the non - lte effects .",
    "the construction of the model atmospheres presented below follows the procedure outlined in @xcite ( here after bha ) . in order to make a direct comparison with hd209458b",
    ", we have adopted the best - fit values for the radius , mass , and orbital separation of hd209458b and its parent star published by @xcite and @xcite ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "we have also assumed that the total flux received by the planet has been uniformly distributed over the planet s dayside .",
    "therefore , the incident flux has been weighted by 0.5 , whereas in the bha models , no redistribution was assumed .",
    "the intrinsic effective temperature of the model ( i.e. the effective temperature of the planet in the absence of irradiation ) is 500k . however , this intrinsic temperature has little effect on the structure of the outer atmosphere which is completely determined by the incident flux . with this redistribution ,",
    "our models represent an upper limit to the equilibrium effective temperature which is about 1800k .",
    "we further assume that the planet has a solar composition with an opacity setup identical to the `` ames - cond '' models of bha and @xcite .",
    "in this situation , dust grains form in the atmosphere at locations determined by the chemical equilibrium equations but their opacity contribution is ignored , mimicking a complete removal of the grains by efficient gravitational settling .",
    "therefore , the models in this study represent cloud free atmospheres .",
    "we model the flux transmitted through the limb of the planet s atmosphere , by solving the spherically symmetric radiative transfer equation ( ssrte ) suitably adjusted to account for the incident radiation .",
    "the incident flux is taken from a separate calculation which reproduces the observed spectrum of hd209458 .",
    "the ssrte has a significant advantage over the plane - parallel solution because a geometry more appropriate ( and more accurate ) for the upper atmosphere is already incorporated . when solving the ssrte ,",
    "the atmosphere is modeled as a discrete number of concentric shells surrounding the interior ( or `` core '' ) .",
    "the solution along characteristic rays that pass through the outer most shells is all that is needed to calculate the transmitted intensities and automatically accounts for the curvature of the limb .",
    "the total transmitted flux is obtained by integrating over the planet limb : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the perpendicular distance from the planet center to a tangential characteristic ray .",
    "@xmath3 is the planet radius at @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the optical depth at @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is chosen such that for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the incident stellar intensity .",
    "this lower limit ensures that the transmitted intensities are well sampled and light from the core region is excluded .",
    "note that both @xmath3 and @xmath12 are determined by the simulation and depend on the resulting structure of the model atmosphere .",
    "the only prescribed radius is @xmath13 , which is equal to the planet radius given in table [ tab1 ] . with these definitions ,",
    "the thickness of the limb ( @xmath14 ) is roughly @xmath15 .",
    "when a gas is assumed to be in lte , the level populations for each species depend entirely upon the gas temperature and electron pressure and are given by the saha - boltzmann distribution . in general , the lte assumption is a matter of computational convenience and is not expected to be valid in most cases , especially in the optically thin regions of an atmosphere .",
    "however , it is often assumed that lte is achieved in very late type stars ( even brown dwarfs ) despite the fact that this assumption has not been thoroughly tested .",
    "departures from lte have previously been investigated for ti i @xcite and co @xcite for cool m dwarfs and for ch@xmath16 in the jovian planets @xcite .",
    "these earlier works found that , for these particular species , nlte effects were small .    due to the close proximity of hd209458b to its parent star",
    ", the planet s atmosphere is subjected to intense stellar radiation .",
    "this inherently _ nonlocal _ source of radiation dramatically alters the conditions of the outer atmosphere compared to an isolated egp .",
    "in addition , the cool atmospheres of egps are dominated by strong opacity sources like h@xmath17o and ch@xmath16 and , therefore , have intensities that differ greatly from those of a blackbody . when combined with the relatively low pressures of the outer atmosphere , these conditions",
    "very likely will lead to departures from lte which may play an important role in determining the atmospheric structure and resulting spectrum .",
    "if lte is to be achieved in egp atmospheres , then the collisional rates must be large enough to compensate for the deviations of the radiative rates from their lte values .",
    "unfortunately , a limitation of all nlte models is a lack of well determined collisional cross - sections for interactions with important species like h@xmath18 , he , and h. however , it is unlikely , given the low thermal velocities , that these particles could restore lte completely .",
    "in fact , the effects of collisions with hydrogen on the na d profile in m dwarfs with chromospheres are fairly small and electron collisions dominate despite the fact that @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the na i model atom used in this work includes 53 levels , and 142 primary transitions ( all bound - bound transitions with @xmath20 ) were included in the solution of the statistical equilibrium equations . for details of the method used to solve the rate equations , see @xcite . as in @xcite for ti",
    "i , electron - impact bound - free collisional rates are approximated by the formula of @xcite and bound - bound collisional rates are based on the semi - empirical formula of @xcite with permitted transitions determined from van regemorter s ( 1962 ) formula . for the ground - state photoionization cross sections ,",
    "we have used the opacity project data of @xcite .",
    "we have also assumed complete redistribution .    we have constructed four model atmospheres and resulting transmitted spectra for hd209458b .",
    "the first irradiated model ( a ) only includes collisions with electrons , where the source of free electrons is primarily the ionization of potassium . even in an irradiated egp atmosphere ,",
    "the number density of electrons is very small ( @xmath21 ) and the temperatures are too low for electronic collisions to be important . model a , therefore , can be considered a lower limit for the collisional rates .",
    "the second irradiated model ( b ) has the same parameters as model a , except that collisions with h@xmath18are also included . in order to place a secure upper limit on the effects of collisions with h@xmath18 ,",
    "we have treated h@xmath18  as if it had the same rate coefficients as an electron . assuming identical cross - sections",
    "implies that the rate coefficients scale with @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the reduced mass of the collision partners .",
    "therefore , we are overestimating the h@xmath18collisional rates by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the remaining two models ( c and d ) represent _ non_-irradiated atmospheres with the same effective temperature as the irradiated models ( @xmath24 1800k ) and include the same lower ( model c ) and upper ( model d ) limits for the collision rates . each of these model atmospheres was produced from a self - consistent solution of the ssrte , chemical equilibrium equations , and the nlte rate equations .",
    "we did not prescribe the temperature structure or mixing ratios for any of the species .",
    "the temperature - pressure profiles for models a and c are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "note that , the profile for model b is identical to that of model a and model d has the same profile as model c. the gas pressures in the limb are very low , ranging from 0.004 mb to 0.2 mb . as is to be expected , the non - irradiated models look nothing like the irradiated models which have temperatures nearly 1000k higher in the outer atmosphere @xcite . there were no significant changes to the temperature - pressure profiles in the four nlte models compared to the lte structures .",
    "departures of the level populations from lte , for a particular species , are usually described by the departure coefficients , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the nlte population density for level @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the lte value @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the @xmath29 s for the ground state ( 3s ) and the first excited states ( 3p@xmath30 , 3p@xmath31 ) of the neutral sodium atom for several different physical conditions within an egp atmosphere .",
    "the largest departures are seen in model a where the 3s ( ground state ) and 3p levels are both underpopulated by many orders of magnitude , especially in the limb region .",
    "the main reason for such large departures is that we have only included collisions with electrons and , in such a cool atmosphere , the number density of electrons is @xmath32 orders of magnitude below that of the dominant species , h@xmath18 .",
    "consequently , there are essentially no collisions in model a to thermalize the level populations in the na atom thus allowing the radiative rates to dominate and drive the system out of lte . also , since the upper atmosphere is dominated by a large external radiation source ( which happens to peak near the na d doublet , @xmath33 ) , the mean intensity of the line is much larger than the thermal source function which implies a strong decoupling of the radiation field from the local conditions .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the line source function to a blackbody is roughly given by the ratio of the departure coefficients of the upper ( 3p ) and lower ( 3s ) levels for the transition @xcite . from figure 2",
    ", we see that the line source function is far from a blackbody for the majority of the upper atmosphere ( since @xmath34 ) .    an obvious question to ask",
    "is whether the system will return to lte if collisions with the dominant species ( h@xmath18 ) are included .",
    "model b , which has the same parameters and temperature profile as model a , includes collisions with both electrons _ and _",
    "h@xmath18  ( but assuming that h@xmath18  has the same rate coefficients as an electron ) .",
    "in effect , we have increased the importance of electronic collisions by more than 8 orders of magnitude . as is expected ,",
    "the departure coefficients are closer to one , but the level populations in the limb are still far from the lte values .",
    "however , since @xmath35 for most of the atmosphere , nlte effects will only be important in model b for @xmath36 .",
    "the real situation is likely to be somewhere between models a and b.    we also show departure coefficients for non - irradiated models ( c and d ) with @xmath37 equal to the equilibrium effective temperature of the irradiated atmospheres ( 1800k ) for both collisional rate limits . despite the absence of any extrinsic radiation and much lower temperatures in the upper layers , the non - irradiated atmospheres still have departures from lte , though generally less significant than those found in the irradiated atmospheres .",
    "model c ( the near collision free limit ) , has departures from lte similar to those of the collision dominated irradiated model ( b ) for the ground state but with an over populated 3p level . with",
    "increased collisional rates , na i has nearly returned to lte for most of the atmosphere in model d with departures still present in the top most layers whereas in the irradiated case both levels were greatly underpopulated even in the collision dominated model ( b ) .",
    "the effects on the na d line profiles are quite dramatic for model a ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) . in this case",
    ", the lack of thermalization reduces the line transfer to nearly a pure scattering case . as a result",
    ", the doublet appears completely in emission .",
    "however , in model b , as the collisional rates are increased , the line wings return to their lte shape while the line cores are reversed .",
    "the data analysis of @xcite does not directly reveal the na line profile produced by the planet atmosphere .",
    "instead , their work shows that a deeper transit is observed in the na band implying additional na absorption by the planet limb .",
    "given the current sensitivity of the observations , a core reversal feature like the one shown in our model b would be buried in the noise and manifest itself as simply a smaller equivalent width .",
    "the na absorption in model b would result in a transit deeper than in the continuum bands but not as deep as implied by the lte model .",
    "the fact that na d absorption ( and not emission ) has been observed in the transmitted spectrum of hd209458b rules out our model a indicating that some thermalization does occur in the limb region .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the collisional rates are as large as those in our model b suggesting that the equivalent width of the na d doublet will be substantially reduced by nlte effects .",
    "the reduced equivalent width predicted by our model is _ not _ due to photoionization of na . in the majority of the limb ,",
    "only 3% is ionized and the neutral na concentration is nearly constant with @xmath38 .",
    "na is only significantly ionized ( @xmath39 ) at the very top of the atmosphere where @xmath40 .",
    "the shallow ionization depth of na is due to the strong uv opacity provided by metals ( e.g. atomic mg , al , ca , fe , and ni ) which effectively shield na from the incident ionizing photons . the ionization predicted by our models ( even 3% ) is far greater than what is obtained from an lte calculation but does not significantly affect the line profile . however ,",
    "if the planet s atmosphere is substantially cooler than in our model , then additional condensation and settling could further deplete the atmosphere of metals and allow greater ionization of na to occur .",
    "we also find that only a very small amount of na is in molecular form and that neutral na is nearly 3 orders of magnitude more abundant than nacl ( the most abundant na bearing molecule ) .",
    "furthermore , condensation of na via nacl grains is unlikely .",
    "the reduced equivalent width and central core emission is purely a radiative transfer effect .",
    "the recent hst observations provided the first direct measurement of the conditions inside the atmosphere of hd209458b .",
    "however , even under the best circumstances , determining the concentration of any species based solely upon one absorption feature is problematic , especially if this feature forms in the upper regions of an atmosphere where pressures are low and nlte effects are greatest . our models clearly show that na is far from being in lte in the upper atmosphere of hd209458b and the observed na absorption can be explained with a solar metallicity atmosphere which is cloud free or has only very low lying clouds .",
    "it is likely that other important species ( e.g. co and ch@xmath16 ) are in nlte , and we plan to test the lte assumption for a wide variety of atomic and molecular species in a future work .",
    "hopefully the na d doublets and other alkali metal lines will be useful diagnostics in the study of egp atmospheres .",
    "however , only with detailed nlte calculations including well determined collisional rates will we have a chance at constraining the physical conditions in the atmosphere of hd209458b .",
    "we would like to thank charbonneau et al . for making a copy of their work available before publication .",
