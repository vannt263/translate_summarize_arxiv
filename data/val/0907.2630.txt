    "current solar neutrino data  @xcite , in conjunction with reactor data from the kamland experiment  @xcite shows that the neutrino oscillation mechanism is the correct picture to explain the solar neutrino physics .",
    "solar neutrino experiments are also sensitive to matter effects  @xcite , and the combination of both solar and kamland data determines the so called large mixing angle ( lma ) solution as the correct explanation to the data . for example , the lma solution is quite robust against possible uncertainties in solar physics , such as noise density fluctuations originated by radiative zone magnetic fields  @xcite . likewise , the lma solution is also stable with respect to the possible existence of sizeable convective zone magnetic fields  @xcite , that could induce spin - flavor neutrino conversions  @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "the kamland data play a crucial role in establishing that nonstandard effects can only play a subleading role  @xcite , their amplitude being effectively constrained .",
    "however , while constrained by the solar and kamland data in an important way , neutrino nonstandard interactions ( nsi ) still provide an important exception to the robustness of the neutrino oscillation interpretation  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been found that they might even shift the solution to the so  called dark side region of the neutrino parameter space  @xcite .",
    "given the envisaged precision expected in upcoming oscillation studies  @xcite , one needs to further scrutinize the possible role of nsi  @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic importance of nsi stems from the fact that they are characteristic features of theories of neutrino mass  @xcite and that their magnitude provides important guidance in order to distinguish the simplest high - scale seesaw models  @xcite from those seesaw scenarios based at low - scale physics , such as the inverse  @xcite or linear seesaw mechanisms  @xcite , as well as radiative models of neutrino mass  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we reanalyze the robustness of the oscillation interpretation of the solar neutrino data in the presence of nonstandard interactions . besides all the solar neutrino data used in our previous study  @xcite",
    ", here we take into account new solar data from sno phase iii  @xcite , the first real - time measurements of the solar beryllium flux at borexino  @xcite , as well as the new and more precise kamland data  @xcite .",
    "we have also considered in our calculations the new solar fluxes and uncertainties from the updated standard solar model ( ssm )  @xcite .",
    "we show explicitly that the degenerate solution in the dark side region still remains plausible even after inclusion of these new data .",
    "besides updating the analysis of nonstandard neutrino - down - quark interactions , we stress the key role is played by the combination of these results with the measurements of the electron - neutrino - quark cross section at the charm accelerator experiment .",
    "although it is sensitive only to the interactions of electron neutrinos , when combined with solar and kamland data , the latter allows us to improve the determination of the tau - neutrino nonstandard axial and vector couplings    in what follows we will focus on nonstandard interactions that can be parametrized with the effective low  energy neutral currents four  fermion operator : @xmath0 where p = l , r and @xmath1 is a first generation fermion : @xmath2 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath3 denote the strength of the nsi between the neutrinos of flavours @xmath4 and @xmath5 and the p  handed component of the fermion @xmath1 . for definiteness , we take for @xmath1 the down - type quark",
    ". however , one can also consider the presence of nsi with electrons and up and down quarks simultaneously .",
    "current and expected limits for the case of nsi with electrons have been reported in the literature  @xcite . here",
    "we confine ourselves to nsi couplings involving only electron and tau neutrinos .",
    "this approximation is in principle justified in view of the somewhat stronger constraints on @xmath6 interactions , for a discussion see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "nonstandard interactions may in principle affect neutrino propagation properties in matter as well as detection cross sections and in certain cases they can also modify the assumed initial fluxes .",
    "nsi effects in neutrino propagation affect the analysis of data from solar neutrino experiments and to some extent also kamland , through the vectorial nsi couplings @xmath7",
    ". on the other hand detection shows sensitivity also to the axial nsi couplings @xmath8 in the sno experiment .",
    "these points will be analyzed in detail in section  [ sec : solar - kamland - data ] , after a brief discussion of the experimental data included in our study . in section  [ sec : constraints - nsi - from ] we will focus on the study of the non - universal nonstandard interactions , combining the results of the charm experiment together with our solar analysis in order to obtain a new constraint for the tau neutrino nonstandard - interaction with d - type quark . finally we will conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "here we will adopt the simplest approximate two  neutrino picture , which is justified in view of the stringent limit on @xmath9  @xcite that follows mainly from reactor neutrino experiments  @xcite .",
    "in this subsection we will describe the input data required to analyze the sensitivity of solar and kamland neutrino data to the presence of nsi .",
    "this will include not only the experimental data samples by all the detectors considered , but also the theoretical predictions required to simulate the solar neutrino production prescribed by the ssm .    concerning the solar neutrino data , we have included in our analysis the most recent results from the radiochemical experiments homestake  @xcite , sage  @xcite and gallex / gno  @xcite , the zenith - spectra data set from super - kamiokande i  @xcite , as well as the results from the two first phases of the sno experiment  @xcite .",
    "the main updates with respect to our previous work  @xcite is the inclusion of the data from the third phase of the sno experiment  @xcite , where @xmath10he proportional counters have been used to measure the neutral current ( nc ) component of the solar neutrino flux , and the latest measurement of the @xmath11be solar neutrino rate performed by the borexino collaboration  @xcite .    in our analysis",
    "we use the solar neutrino fluxes and uncertainties given by the latest version of the ssm  @xcite .",
    "the latter provides an improved determination of the neutrino flux uncertainties , mainly thanks to the improved accuracy on the @xmath10he-@xmath12he cross section measurement and to the reduced systematic uncertainties in the determination of the surface composition of the sun . in ref .",
    "@xcite two different solar model calculations are presented , corresponding to two different measurements of the solar metal abundances . for our analysis",
    "we have chosen the model corresponding to a higher solar metallicity , bps08(gs ) , although we have checked that the use of the lower metallicity model bps08(ags ) does not change our results substantially .",
    "the kamland experiment observes the disappearance of reactor antineutrinos over an average distance of 180 km .",
    "given that , in their way to the detector , reactor neutrinos can only traverse the most superficial layers of the earth , the resulting earth matter effects are almost negligible .",
    "the same applies also to the nonstandard interactions we are considering .",
    "however , for consistency with our analysis of solar neutrino data , in our simulation of the kamland experiment , we have included the effect of nsi over the antineutrino propagation . in particular , we have considered that neutrinos travel through a layer of constant matter density equal to the terrestrial crust density ( @xmath13 2.6 g@xmath14@xmath15 ) .",
    "here we have used the latest data release from the kamland reactor experiment  @xcite , with a total exposure of 2881  ton@xmath14yr , which brings in a big statistical improvement with respect to the previous data reported by the collaboration  @xcite .",
    "we have restricted our analysis to the energy range above 2.6  mev where the contributions from geo - neutrinos is less important . as we will see in the next section",
    ", the inclusion of the new kamland data will be very important for the improvement of the results , given the good precision achieved in the determination of the oscillation neutrino parameters .",
    "we first reanalyse the determination of the oscillation parameters in the presence of nonstandard interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian describing solar neutrino evolution in the presence of nsi contains , in addition to the standard oscillations term , @xmath16 a term @xmath17 , accounting for an effective potential induced by the nsi with matter , which may be written as : @xmath18    here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are two effective parameters that , according to the current bounds discussed above ( @xmath21 ) , are related with the vectorial couplings which affect the neutrino propagation by : @xmath22 the quantity @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsi - hamiltonian ] ) is the number density of the down - type quark along the neutrino path , and @xmath24 is the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : msw - hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ eq : nsi - hamiltonian ] ) one sees that the solar neutrino mixing angle in the presence of nonstandard interactions is given by the following expression : @xmath25_{matter } } ,      \\label{cos - mat - nsi}\\ ] ] where @xmath26_{matter}^2 =       \\left [          \\delta m^2\\cos 2\\theta -          2\\sqrt{2}\\,e g_f ( n_e - \\varepsilon ' n_d )       \\right]^2       \\\\",
    "+      \\left[\\delta m^2          \\sin 2\\theta + 4\\sqrt{2}\\,\\varepsilon\\ , e g_f n_d       \\right]^2\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] therefore , and as discussed in ref.@xcite , there exists a degeneracy between the non - universal coupling @xmath20 and the neutrino mixing angle @xmath27 which makes possible to explain the solar neutrino data for values of the vacuum mixing angle in the dark side ( @xmath28 ) , for large enough values of @xmath20 : @xmath29 for instance , for the typical values of the solar neutrino energies and matter densities one has @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , as we showed in  @xcite , the effect of nsi on solar neutrino propagation implies the presence of an additional lma - d solution whose status we now reanalyse in the light of new data .",
    "we now turn to the combined solar + kamland analysis . following the considerations above",
    ", we have performed a new analysis of all the solar neutrino data discussed in section [ sec : data ] combined with the recent kamland result  @xcite .",
    "the main result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : updated ] .",
    "there , we plot the allowed regions ( 90 , 95 and 99 % c.l . ) in the solar neutrino oscillation parameter space ( @xmath31 ) obtained in the analysis of solar and solar + kamland neutrino data , after marginalizing over the nsi parameters in our 4-dimensional @xmath32 analysis : @xmath32(@xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) .",
    "the @xmath35 profiles as a function of each parameter are also shown .",
    "one can see that the region in the so - called dark side of the neutrino parameters  @xcite remains even after the inclusion of the new data .",
    "note however that its status is somewhat worse than previously .",
    "in contrast , as seen in the figure , the other solutions lma-0 and lma - ii  @xcite which were present before have disappeared as a result of the new kamland data , that now provide a very precise measurement of @xmath36 .        in order to better understand the results obtained , we plot at fig .  [",
    "fig : pee ] the neutrino survival probabilities for different reference points .",
    "first we have considered the global best fit point from the combined solar + kamland analysis , labeled as `` global best fit '' in the figure , with the following parameter values : ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) = ( 0.32 , 7.9@xmath37 10@xmath38 ev@xmath39 , -0.15 , -0.10 ) .",
    "we have also considered the best fit point in the absence of nsi : ( 0.30 , 7.9@xmath37 10@xmath38 ev@xmath39 , 0.00 , 0.00 ) , labeled as `` bf without nsi '' , and allowed with a @xmath40 = 2.7 , and finally the best fit point in the `` dark side '' of the oscillation parameters ( labeled as `` bf dark side '' ) with ( 0.70 , 7.9@xmath37 10@xmath38 ev@xmath39 , -0.15 , 0.95 ) and @xmath40= 2.9 .",
    "as we see all points are in perfect agreement with the low energy ( pp and @xmath11be ) measurements . concerning the most energetic boron neutrinos , where matter effects are more important , and as a result there is a higher nsi  sensitivity of the corresponding profiles , the presence of nsi provides an slightly better agreement with the data than the standard one without nsi ,",
    "mainly thanks to the flatter spectrum predicted above 5 mev .",
    "the `` dark - side '' solution also gives predictions for the survival probability of boron neutrinos which are compatible with the experimental results . from the different predictions obtained for these 3 reference points above a few mev",
    ", one sees that this region could be crucial in order to break the degeneracy among the various solutions .",
    "therefore , a better measurement of the boron neutrino flux with a lower threshold ( like the ones expected from super - k - iii and sno  @xcite ) will be of great help .",
    "on the other hand , a very precise measurement of the pep and beryllium neutrino fluxes may also contribute to lift the degeneracy between the standard and dark - side solutions .        by analysing the goodness of the neutrino oscillation solutions in the presence of nsi one",
    "can also constrain the nsi parameters @xmath19 and @xmath41 . in order to do this",
    "we first marginalize our 4-parameter @xmath32 analysis with respect to the remaining three neutrino parameters .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eps - epsp ] .",
    "one can see that the new data allow us to constraint @xmath19 , the flavor changing parameter , while for the flavor conserving case there is still room for relatively large values of @xmath20 that correspond to the solution in the dark side of the neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "these are the bounds we obtained at the 90% c.l .",
    "@xmath42    the above limits are in good agreement with the forecast made in fig . 3 of @xcite , assuming the best possible determination of the neutrino mixing parameters due to kamland .",
    "in fact , they are even a bit better than expected from the improvement of kamland data only .",
    "the reason for this is the subsequent improvement of solar data , which slightly improved their sensitivity to the nonstandard interactions .    for the flavour - changing effective coupling @xmath43",
    ", one can use the first expression in eq .",
    "( [ eff - coup ] ) to translate the bound obtained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eps - lim0 ] ) into a limit over the vectorial coupling @xmath44 : @xmath45 where we have used the best fit value for the atmospheric mixing angle  @xcite .",
    "so far , the strongest limit on this parameter is @xmath46 @xcite . from our analysis , we see that solar neutrino data are not only sensitive to the sign of this coupling but also we have improved the lower bound .",
    "the presence of nonstandard interactions can also affect the detection processes at some experiments .",
    "in particular , the cross section for the neutral current detection reaction at sno : @xmath47 is proportional to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the coupling of the neutrino current to the axial isovector hadronic current  @xcite . therefore , the presence of an axial nonstandard coupling would give rise to an extra contribution to the nc signal at the sno experiment .",
    "this nonstandard contribution can be parametrised in the following way  @xcite : @xmath50 where terms of order @xmath51 have been neglected . here",
    "@xmath52 denotes the boron neutrino flux , and the effective axial coupling @xmath53 is defined as in  @xcite : @xmath54 once the nonstandard axial couplings with up - type quarks are set to zero .",
    "note that @xmath55 , denoting the couplings entering in the effective lagrangian shown in eq .",
    "( [ lagrang ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath53 is independent of the effective couplings @xmath43 and @xmath56 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eff - coup ] ) .",
    "so far we have assumed in our analysis that @xmath57 .",
    "this assumption is well justified due to the good agreement between the sno nc measurement : @xmath58 = @xmath59  ( stat ) @xmath60  ( syst ) @xmath37",
    "@xmath61 @xmath62 @xcite and the ssm prediction for the boron flux @xmath52 = @xmath63 @xmath37 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "however , we now relax this assumption by including the effect of the new parameter @xmath53 .",
    "the results obtained in a generalized 5-parameter - analysis which takes into account the presence of a non - zero axial component of the nsi are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : solar ] . in the left panel",
    "we compare the allowed regions at 90 , 95 and 99% c.l .",
    "obtained in the full 5-parameter - analysis ( filled / colored regions ) with the ones obtained in the previous section , neglecting the effect of the axial nsi couplings ( hollow lines ) .",
    "one sees that both analysis are consistent , though , as expected , the inclusion of the axial parameter in the analysis somewhat extends the allowed region . in the right panel",
    "we show the @xmath40 profile as a function of the effective axial coupling @xmath53 .",
    "there , one sees that the neutrino data clearly prefers @xmath64 , thanks to the good agreement between the predicted boron neutrino flux and the nc observations at sno , as stated above .",
    "we obtain we following allowed range at 90% c.l . @xmath65    using eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsa ] ) , the above bound on the effective axial coupling @xmath66 can be translated into individual bounds on the nsi parameters @xmath67 .",
    "since we are neglecting the nonstandard interactions of the muon neutrino , this formula depends only on the probabilities @xmath68 , @xmath69 and on the nsi couplings @xmath70 and @xmath71 . from the recent values for the average probabilities reported by sno  @xcite : @xmath72 one gets an allowed region in the parameter space ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) , represented ( at the 90% c.l . ) as a diagonal band in fig .",
