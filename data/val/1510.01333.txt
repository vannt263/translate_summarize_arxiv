    "broad - line radio galaxies are the radio - loud kin of seyfert 1 galaxies , and as such they offer the possibility of investigating why some agn show strong radio jets . understanding the origin of the radio - loudness is important , since the mechanical energy deposited through agn jet activity is thought to be a primary way that the agn can impact its host galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "recent studies show that the cool gas necessary to re - trigger the agn activity needed to power the radio - loudness in radio galaxies , which are pre - dominatently hosted by ellipticals , is provided by galaxy interactions such as mergers @xcite .",
    "however , this still does not address the issue that , while some agn do launch powerful jets , many do not .",
    "it is possible that the magnetic field build - up and black hole spin are decisive factors for this @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations can provide both the determination of the black hole spin , as well as the detection of any changes in the inner accretion disk as one might expect them from significant changes to the magnetic flux strength .",
    "previous works in the x - ray band have indicated that a typical radio galaxy x - ray spectrum possesses a relatively flat photon index , weak cold reflection signatures , and in some cases a weak relativistic reflection component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the distinctly flatter photon index raises questions as to whether the entire comptonization spectrum is different in this source class , implying differences in the balance of cooling and heating of the corona .",
    "the recent launch of the _ nustar _",
    "observatory @xcite provides the opportunity to study the broadband spectra of agn with unprecedented sensitivity , allowing us to start directly addressing this issue in sources . to yield the best results the target s x",
    "- ray spectrum should possess a continuum dominated by comptonization , requiring only weak or no jet contribution .",
    "a recent study of a suitable source , the radio galaxy 3c382 , with _ nustar _ confirms the previous results of weak reflection and a flat photon index .",
    "additionally they show for the first time that the high - energy cut - off of the comptonization spectrum is time - variable in radio galaxies and possibly flux - dependent @xcite .",
    "this paper builds on this discovery and the need for a better understanding of comptonization spectrum in broad - line radio galaxies , focusing on the coronal parameters of the radio galaxy , 3c390.3 ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ; @xcite ) , using a joint soft x - ray ( _ suzaku _ ) and hard x - ray ( _ nustar _ ) observation",
    ".    previous work in the x - ray band on 3c390.3 has found its timing properties not to differ from those of radio - quiet seyferts @xcite and there to be no noticeable contribution from jet to the x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed a detailed broad - band spectral analysis including _ xmm _ , _ suzaku _ , and _ swift_-bat data , determining that two different spectral models can describe the x - ray spectra well .",
    "the first model includes a continuum modeled by a cut - off power law ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , cold reflection ( @xmath9 ) and a narrow gaussian line to model the fexxv line detected in the data .",
    "the second model is similar to the first model but models the fexxv line with a highly ionized , blurred reflector ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite that the modeling of fexxv and ionized reflection can be ambiguous in broad - line radio galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : we begin by providing an overview of how the data were reduced in  [ datared ] .",
    "this is followed by a description of the x - ray spectral modeling (  [ spec_modeling ] ) , and a brief study dedicated to the iron k band (  [ fe_modeling ] ) .",
    "the x - ray analysis is then supplemented by a study of spectral energy distribution of this agn (  [ sed_modeling ] ) and conclude with a discussion of our results (  [ disc ] ) .",
    "an overview of the observations considered in this work is given in table  [ nu_obs ] .",
    ".overview of observations and their characteristics .",
    "the exposures are the net exposures used during the x - ray broad - band spectral modeling given per xis in the case of _ suzaku _ and per fpm for _ nustar_. [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also tested an alternative scenario similar to the one suggested by @xcite , where the accretion disk is covered by a warm layer producing a low temperature , optically - thick comptonization component that extends from the optical / uv into the soft x - ray band .",
    "this component is assumed to replace the standard accretion disk component .",
    "however , we find that such a component is unable to produce enough optical / uv flux without producing significantly more soft x - ray flux than observed .",
    "with a 2 - 10kev flux of @xmath11 the source was observed to be brighter in this observation than in any other previous high quality ccd data and slightly above the average flux of all previous _ rxte _ observations @xcite . from the 2 - 10kev flux",
    ", we estimate an eddington fraction of 1% using a bolometric correction of 6.33 as determined by @xcite .",
    "the results from the x - ray spectral analysis in this work are in good agreement with those of the previous broad - band analysis by @xcite .",
    "contrary to the softer - when - brighter trend seen in many seyferts , the photon index of the power law in this observation is similar to that of the previous high quality ccd observations at lower flux ( @xmath12 versus 1.72 ) , suggesting a rather stable shape for the primary continuum .",
    "the neutral reflection fraction on the other hand is found to be much smaller in this observation ( @xmath13 versus 0.81 ) and much more in the realm that is typically expected for broad - line radio galaxies .",
    "this could however be due to the inclusion of the bat data , which is non - simultaneaous in the @xcite analysis .",
    "attributing the discrepancy to such a technical problem seems reasonable given that the average pca+hxte spectra indicate reflection fraction of @xmath14 @xcite . in our observation",
    "we do not find evidence for any broadening in the iron k@xmath15 line (  [ fe_modeling ] ) , however we do find a weak soft excess that can be well described by a blurred ionized reflector . attempting to model the soft x - ray excess with an additional power law , which could physically represent either a low energy comptonization component @xcite or a jet component , leads to a worse fit than the reflection scenario .",
    "( this is also confirmed by the sed fitting in  [ sed_modeling ] . )",
    "therefore we conclude similar to @xcite and @xcite that an ionized reflector is present in the x - ray spectrum of this agn .",
    "the fact that it is not very apparent in this observation can be explained by a variable ionized reflector .",
    "a variable ionized reflector is predicted along with the formation of the new jet knots @xcite and would therefore not be surprising .",
    "the exact strength and shape of the ionized reflection component in 3c390.3 depends on the comptonization model , as we will see below .",
    "the overall exceptionally low reflection fraction observed in broad - line radio galaxies can be explained by an outflowing corona @xcite .",
    "if the corona is outflowing at mildly relativistic speeds , the emission is beamed away from the accretion disk lowering the amount of reflection .",
    "overall , we find that the x - ray spectrum of 3c390.3 can be well described by a model consisting of a primary continuum , cold and ionized reflection , and photoionized emission . for the primary continuum we consider three possibilities : a cut - off power law as a purely phenomenological model and the two thermal comptonization models ` comptt ` and ` eqpair ` .",
    "all continua yield fits of comparable quality and the total spectral models consequently appear almost identical in the observable 0.7 - 80kev band ( fig .",
    "[ models_comparison ] ) .",
    "however , the contribution of the different model components differs for the two comptonization models . in figure  [ models_comparison ]",
    "the dashed lines show the primary continuum for both cases , indicating that for the ` comptt ` case the primary continuum accounts for most of the flux at lower energies , while for ` eqpair ` this is not the case .",
    "the remaining , required soft x - ray flux in the ` eqpair ` case is made by neutral and ionized reflection , as the increase in the reflection fraction shows with @xmath16=0.09 to @xmath17=0.30 and @xmath18=0.07 to @xmath19=0.23 . at first glance",
    "one might therefore be tempted to reject the ` eqpair ` solution .",
    "the view changes , however , as one extends the models to energies above 80kev , where the models diverge .",
    "no x - ray data exists for those energies that are simultaneous with the _ suzaku_/_nustar _",
    "observation , but we can use the average 70month _ swift_-bat spectrum as guidance on how the x - ray spectrum might look like at higher energies .",
    "the spectrum , which is overlayed on the best fit model in figure  [ models_comparison ] , agrees well with all best fit models below 40kev , above this energy it is systematically brighter .",
    "it is important to note here that it is inherent to comptonization models that they roll over more rapidly than the phenomenological exponential cut - off included in ` pexmon ` @xcite . comparing the two comptonization models",
    ", it seems that the ` eqpair ` solution produces fluxes better in agreement with bat spectrum .",
    "the high energy cut - off of our thermal comptonization spectrum of 117@xmath20kev is in very good agreement with a joint ibis / bat spectral analysis suggesting a cut - off temperature of @xmath21kev @xcite and the result from the joint epic - pn / xis / pin / bat fit by @xcite returning @xmath22kev .",
    "this would suggest that the coronal temperature was constant , however the large errorbars can not exclude a change . possibly , fig .",
    "[ models_comparison ] could be seen as weak evidence that at brighter fluxes the cut - off is lower .",
    "such a trend could be caused by increased coronal cooling from stronger uv emission ( more seed photons ) .",
    "indeed , when comparing the uvot fluxes to the om fluxes we find that the source was brighter in the new uvot observation ( the agn flux doubled in the u - band ) .",
    "it is likely that given the large errorbars a small change in the coronal temperature / high energy cut - off would be undetectable .",
    "the coronal temperature found for 3c390.3 is rather cool ( @xmath3kev ) , similar to what has been found in ic 4329a @xcite , swift j2127.4 + 5654 @xcite and mcg-05 - 23 - 016 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these coronae with temperatures of @xmath23 , _ nustar _ has also found several sources with coronal temperatures above 150kev such as 3c382 @xcite and ark120 @xcite .",
    "the number of measurements is still too small to suggest a reason for the wide spread of the measured temperatures .",
    "one possibility could be that the coronal temperature is linked to the radiative compactness of the corona . while we have already noted that the hard over soft compactness measures the ratio of heating and cooling , the compactness by itself tells us about the importance of photon - photon interactions @xcite .",
    "if @xmath24 is much greater than 1 ( as is the case here ) these become important .",
    "if sufficient high - energy photons are produced via compton upscattering these will start to create electron / positron pairs until at some point there will be so many pairs formed that the temperature of the corona is decreased significantly . therefore there is a maximum temperature a corona can reach at any given compactness .",
    "below this temperature the corona would still be able to heat up further , but above it pair production will cool it down again .",
    "accurate predictions of this equilibrium temperature are difficult as it depends on the unknown geometrical layout of the disk corona system .",
    "however , @xcite show that the coronal temperature measurements with _ nustar _ do indeed show a dependency with the coronal compactness that is similar to that expected for a slab corona .",
    "the measurement of 3c390.3 , which is also included in @xcite , agrees well with the other measurements and supports the idea of an equilibrium temperature .    aside from the coronal temperature",
    "the other key parameter returned by the comptonization models is the optical depth of the corona . from our measurements we find it to be large ( @xmath25 ) , meaning that all soft photons entering the corona will be scattered multiple times .",
    "depending on the geometry of the corona this could lead to an apparent truncation of the accretion disk as the photons can not escape unscattered .",
    "this apparent truncation could be detected in the reflection spectrum and the accretion disk spectrum .",
    "unfortunately the _",
    "swift_-uvot photometry does not allow a measurement of the accretion disk temperature for the unscattered component , which could indentify a blocked central region .",
    "however , our measurements of high spin and very high emissivity from the reflection spectrum , if taken at face value , suggest that we are seeing very close to the black hole .",
    "in fact the vast majority of the reflection would stem from a small ring around the black hole .",
    "the easiest way to bring this into agreement with the high optical depth of the corona would be a very compact corona ( see also below ) .",
    "we caution however that the extreme reflection parameters could also indicate that we have reached the limits of the current spectral models .",
    "curious is also the disagreement between uv predicted by the x - ray spectral and measured uv emission by about a factor of @xmath26 .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been found for 3c382 with also a factor of about 10 @xcite .",
    "this mismatch of predicted and measured uv / optical emission can be explained by the spatial compactness of the corona , which causes only a small fraction of the total disk emission to enter the corona and be comptonized .",
    "there is much observational evidence for the corona being of small spatial extent , for example microlensing ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , broad iron lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and time lags ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sed presented in figure  [ sed ] also reveals that a naive modeling of the sed as is performed in this work predicts detectable accretion disk flux in the very soft x - ray band .",
    "this small flux contribution from the accretion disk is inconsistent with the weak soft excess observed in the x - ray spectrum of 3c390.3 . with the continuum being describable by only thermal comptonization , no contribution from the jet to the x - ray spectrum",
    "can be found in 3c390.3 .",
    "this is another matter concerning radio galaxy x - ray spectra , which is generally still open to debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our finding is in good agreement with the fermi non - detection of 3c390.3 suggesting that the jet emission is only very weak in the hard x - ray band @xcite .",
