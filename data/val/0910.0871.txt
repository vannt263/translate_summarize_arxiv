    "star clusters are commonly used to trace the stellar content and star formation history of their host systems .",
    "the main limitations to this approach are the finite lifetime of a cluster ( disruption ) and evolutionary fading . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the lifetime of a cluster should depend upon its initial mass and the properties of the environment in which it evolves ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* spitzer 1958 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",

    "* boutloukos & lamers 2003 ) ) * mass independent disruption ( mid , ( * ? ? ? * fall , chandar & whitmore 2005 ) )    in the mid model , ` survivors ' are selected on a purely random basis and a constant fraction is destroyed every age dex .",
    "intriguing as it may be , this model clashes with several principles of cluster dynamics that would need to be revised considerably to accommodate it . in this contribution",
    "we test cluster dissolution and attempt to disentangle it from incompleteness and the statistical biases that have in the past limited such studies .",
    "we then compare theory to observations of the m33 cluster system .",
    "before providing a treatment of an observed data - set , let us try to understand the ` tools of the trade ' , the statistical distributions used to study and characterise the cluster disruption process . to achieve that , we have created an artificial population with a constant cluster formation history ( cfh ) and masses drawn from a power - law distribution with index @xmath2  although we note that the cluster initial mass function was recently found by ( * ? ? ?",

    "log - bins accentuate the increase of the number of high mass clusters with increasing age .",
    "this arises because the sample grows with time  a ` size - of - sample ' effect . as the sample increases ,",
    "so does the likelihood of producing a massive cluster .      unlike the top envelope of the age - mass diagram , the line along the bottom of the distribution is not caused by statistics , but the detection limit of our modelled observations .",
    "as clusters fade with time , this constant limiting flux translates into an increasing limiting mass .    in most of the cases observed cluster samples will be luminosity limited . as the population ages , clusters of higher mass fade below the detection limit",
    "we have denoted this by a green line , representing the mass of a cluster with @xmath6 ( adapted to the study of m33 that will follow ) at a given age .",
    "@xmath3  band is normally the limiting filter in observational studies and we emulate the detection limit in this plot .      the lower panel shows the main diagnostic used in the study of cluster disruption .",
    "the vertical axis gives the number of clusters our imaginary galaxy formed in each log - age bin , normalised to unit time ( in this case one myr ) .",
    "here we present the input sample as a solid line : a constant cfh gives rise to a flat line .",
    "this will not , however , be observed , due to the detection limit .",
    "the green line shows all clusters that lie above the detection limit in each log - age bin and displays the characteristic power - law shape found in all observational studies .",
    "the interpretation of this plot is far from trivial : this @xmath5 shape means that 90% of the population is lost with each age dex .",
    "mid interprets this as 90% of clusters dissolving each age dex (  in m33 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sarajedini & mancone 2007 ) ) . in this example",
    ", however , this is due to detection incompleteness .",
    "thus , a model has to treat _ fading _ and _ dissolution _ as two separate and concurrent causes of cluster disappearance .      having established the above , we can now perform a simple test for the mass dependence of cluster disruption : cutting the sample according to mass .    in the @xmath4  plot we present two mass cuts as a red and blue line respectively . both cuts",
    "split the power - law distribution to a composite shape : a flat part , i.e. a constant cluster formation rate , and a power - law decline , due to clusters fading below the detection limit .",
    "after understanding the caveats inherent in the study of the @xmath4  plot , we can proceed to plot the distribution of an observed cluster sample .",
    "we obtained the age and mass of a sample of @xmath7 _ bona fide _ clusters in m33 ( spanning the entire surface of the galaxy , an unbiased , _ hst_-selected sample ; ( * ? ? ?",
