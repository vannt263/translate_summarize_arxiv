    "planktonic foraminifera ( pf ) are unicellular organisms that commonly live in the sea surface and intermediate water rarely in the deepest part of water column .",
    "pf are very sensible to the seasonal temperature variations , and in particular some species prefer sea surface tropical water , while other species prefer temperate or polar water @xcite .",
    "the study of dynamic population of pf permit to obtain climatic curves through two methods : i ) study of the percentage ratio between tropical and temperate / polar species ; ii ) analysis of the oxygen isotope @xmath0 variations by carbonatic test of pf @xcite .",
    "pf are in fact good markers for the reconstruction of earth climate @xcite .",
    "moreover other methods are used to reconstruct the earth s climate history , as that based on the analysis of variations of ( @xmath0 ) , present in the ice cores from greenland and antarctic @xcite . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , climatic fluctuations were essentially produced by cyclical variations of sun energy received by earth , that periodically change its astronomical parameters ( equinox precession , 21 ky ( @xmath1 ) ; obliquity of earth s axis , 41 ky ; eccentricity of the orbit @xmath2 ky ) .",
    "these astronomical cyclicities are known in earth sciences as milankovitch s cycles , and they can be considered a quasi - deterministic signal that periodically produced drastic changes in earth climate .",
    "the astronomical forcing is not the only reason for glacial / interglacial oscillations .",
    "in fact insolation variations produce changes in the atmospheric temperature , but the geographical distribution , and position , of continent and margin plates are extremely important .",
    "the presence of a barrier , as the continental marginal plate , indeed can influence the atmospheric and oceanic currents .",
    "in addition to these global events , other `` randomic '' events occur : ( i ) tectonic uplift of belt ridge ; ( ii ) volcanic activity , in particular explosive eruptions ; ( iii ) meteor impacts , that occasionally strike the earth and that caused several catastrophic mass extinctions @xcite . the mediterranean sea ,",
    "because of its geographical position , between tropical and temperate area , is a good laboratory for the study of the climatic variations of earth history @xcite .",
    "high resolution studies carried out on marine sediments and ice cores from greenland and antarctic , have demonstrated that in the last @xmath3 kyr , in addition to the classic milankovitch cycles , other cyclic variations were present with a higher frequencies , known as sub - milankovian cycles . in particular spectral analysis carried out on these sequences",
    "has permitted to recognize periodicities of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 years @xcite .",
    "recently geochemical isotopes of ice cores from greenland have suggested that earth s climate variations occur according to the model based on stochastic resonance phenomenon @xcite .",
    "in this work we analyze data from : ( i ) mediterranean core sediments ( sites @xmath8 , leg @xmath9 ) , taken during ocean drilling program ( odp ) , and compared with upper pleistocene ice cores ( grip and gisp2 ) , from greenland @xcite ; ( ii ) landscape section outcropping in southern sicily , and compared with pliocene - pleistocene core sediments come from atlantic ocean sites @xmath10 @xcite . for detailed description of experiments",

    "the pf fluctuation abundances @xcite are compared with oxygen isotope of gisp2 .",
    "there is a good correlation between the fluctuation percentage ratio of a particular warm species ( _ globigerinoides ruber _ ) and @xmath0 variations . in particular",

    "to @xmath18 my , lithological and foraminifera cyclicities are mostly controlled by precession forcing ( fig .",
    "3a ) , while after @xmath18 my the obliquity forcing becomes dominant @xcite .",
    "this change in climatic earth system is connected with a casual event as the uplift of panama area and , consequently , with the closure of panamian isthmus .",
    "3a represents the time interval around the major step in panama closure .",
    "this event produced a drastic change in oceanic and atmospheric circulation with the amplification of gulf current gyre and an increase of the formation of north atlantic deep water ( nadw ) in consequence @xcite . in fig .",
    "3 it is possible to observe that the drastic increase of oscillation amplitude of cold species , recognized in the mediterranean sea , starts in coincidence with sharp increase of oxygen isotope ( atlantic ocean ) .",
    "the mediterranean sea has perfectly recorded this important global climatic cooling that favored the formation of polar ice sheet @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the biological system above described appear rather complex due to the presence of periodicities which sometimes disappear .",
    "the main peculiarities observed from experimental time series of pf are : ( i ) geological events produce `` time windows '' characterized by quasi - periodic fluctuations with almost constant intensity , which can be ascribed to different _ `` noise levels '' _ ; ( ii ) some periodicities appear in one of this `` time window '' , while are absent in all the other ones ; ( iii ) the two species _ g. ruber _ and _ globigerina bulloides _ coexist in a competing dynamical regime . as a first approximation we try to describe the behavior of our ecosystem by a stochastic model of two competing species by using the following generalized lotka - volterra ( lv ) equations @xcite    -0.6 cm @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are statistically independent @xmath22-correlated gaussian white noises with zero mean .",

    "is established , while for @xmath26 an exclusion regime takes place , i.e. in a finite time one of the two species extinguishes .",
    "it is then interesting to investigate the time evolution of the ecosystem for @xmath23 varying around the critical value @xmath27 in the presence of fluctuations , due to the significant interaction with the environment .",
    "this behavior can be obtained assuming @xmath23 subjected to a bistable potential and a periodic driving according to the following stochastic differential equation @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is a generalized bistable potential @xmath32 .",

    "the two species coexist and quasi - periodic oscillations appear with random periodical inversions of populations ( fig .",
    "[ time_series ] ) .",
    "an increase of the noise ( @xmath37 ) produces an enhancement of the amplitude of these quasi - periodical oscillation as observed in experimental data ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "the appearance of some periodicities , previously `` hidden '' , are due to the stochastic resonance phenomenon .",
    "the periodical signal of small amplitude , that is the obliquity in fig .  3 , is enhanced by the presence of the noise  @xcite .",
    "we note finally that the theoretical model , based on the stochastic resonance phenomenon , predicts a time behavior of the two species abundances , which can not be obtained by using models which are simply periodic or stochastic @xcite .",
