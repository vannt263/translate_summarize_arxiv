    "nonequilibrium transitions from stuck to moving states underlie the physics of a wide range of phenomena @xcite , from fracture and earthquake rupture @xcite to flux flow in type - ii superconductors   @xcite and sliding of charge density waves in metals @xcite .",
    "the rich collective nonequilibrium dynamics of this broad range of phenomena can be modeled as an extended medium driven over quenched disorder .",
    "one can distinguish two main classes depending on whether the description allows or not for plastic deformations of the medium . within each class",
    "one may restrict to microscopic overdamped dynamics or allow for more complicated , e.g.  inertial , effects .",
    "the first class of models , overdamped _",
    "media pulled by an applied force @xmath6 , has been studied extensively . by definition ,",
    "the driven medium can be deformed by disorder but is not allowed to tear , and topological defects are excluded , the only degrees of freedom being elastic deformations .",
    "the question of applicability of this model to realistic situations is still debated in the static case ( @xmath7 ) , and even more so in the driven dynamics .",
    "the general expectation is that such a model is relevant to describe real systems in some range of lengthscales , a range which becomes broad ( and potentially infinite , depending on space dimension ) in weak - disorder , strong - elasticity situations .",
    "indeed one may conceive that , even if topological defects can be generated by the competition of elasticity , disorder and drive , they may remain bounded , and confined to shorter scales and thus unimportant for the effective large - scale description .",
    "this is known to happen in the statics , e.g.  for interfaces in random ferromagnets .",
    "even when topological defects are relevant at large scale , the elastic description may still apply at shorter scales .",
    "hence the overdamped elastic model is a necessary first step to understand the collective dynamics in more complex situations .",
    "many results were obtained for this model , although some questions remain open : at zero temperature ( @xmath8 ) the elastic model exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition from a pinned to a sliding state at a critical value @xmath9 of the driving force , first studied in the context of charge density waves @xcite . starting from mean - field theory @xcite ,",
    "an analogy with standard critical phenomena was developed , with the medium s mean velocity @xmath10 acting as the order parameter , and a diverging correlation length @xcite .",
    "a functional extension of usual rg was developed to treat quenched disorder and obtain the roughness and dynamical exponents at the threshold @xmath11 to 1-loop accuracy @xcite .",
    "extensions at non - zero @xmath10 emphasized the differences with standard critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "it was shown that a two - loop functional rg ( frg ) approach is necessary to fully describe the difference between statics and @xmath11 quasi - static depinning @xcite and to reach satisfactory agreement with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "universality classes were identified , which are distinguished , for example , by the range of interactions or by the periodicity ( or nonperiodicity ) of the pinning forces .",
    "a key feature of the overdamped elastic model is that for one component displacements @xmath12 , i.e.  interfaces , the sliding state is unique , the @xmath13 curve is single - valued , and no hysteresis can occur in the moving state at @xmath14 .",
    "this property , based on middleton s theorem @xcite , which also leads to simplifications @xcite in the frg description for @xmath12 is not expected to hold for @xmath15 . as a result ,",
    "the understanding of the @xmath15 depinning transition for e.g.  lines or vortex lattices , is still not satisfactory despite some attempts@xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is a second type of universality classes for depinning ( e.g.  anisotropic depinning ) which does not obey the so - called statistical tilt symmetry ( or rotation symmetry ) and where non - linear terms become relevant ( e.g.  kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) like terms ) @xcite . despite efforts @xcite , a complete theory for this class is still lacking , and even the value of the upper critical dimension is a matter of debate",
    ". the question of non - linear terms may be of importance to experiments of contact line depinning and cracks @xcite . away from depinning ,",
    "well into the uniformly sliding state at @xmath14 , it was found that the dynamics can be surprisingly rich @xcite , especially for @xmath15 component periodic objects  @xcite .",
    "new terms can be generated in the equation of motion , a linear convective term , a static random - force term , and a host of possible non - linear , kpz - type terms @xcite . for @xmath15 , a distinct , ``",
    "moving glass '' fixed point was found in the frg , with persistence of transverse order and transverse pinning , leading to the prediction of a moving bragg - glass and a moving smectic state  @xcite . in",
    "both states the flow is organized in static - like channels , in a layered fashion .",
    "extensions to correlated disorder was studied , and a moving bose - glass state predicted @xcite . although clear evidence of these effects were found in numerics and experiments  @xcite , no systematic study of finite - size corrections was made . since the simultaneous analytical treatment of all the terms allowed by symmetry within a frg approach is a problem of formidable complexity  @xcite , even a fully consistent theory of the elastic flow at large velocity is still lacking .",
    "hence the question of which moving state is stable in the thermodynamic limit is still open . finally ,",
    "once the elastic system is understood , one may hope to construct arguments for or against stability of the elastic flow to defects .",
    "these however are even more delicate than in the statics , where the stability of the bragg glass was debated , and the validity of the driven elastic model has only been assessed qualitatively  @xcite .",
    "hence , as one can see , despite being well studied , the overdamped elastic model is still far from being understood .",
    "extensions to include inertial effects and stress overshoots have also been considered @xcite , but much work remains to be done .",
    "there are many experimental situations where the elastic medium model seems insufficient and one needs to take into account plastic deformations , as e.g.  topological defects in the medium . in a wide class of experiments strong disorder yields large deformations of the driven medium that make a strictly elastic model of the extended structure inapplicable  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the medium tears as topological defects are constantly generated and healed by the interplay of drive , disorder and interactions @xcite . at slow average flow rates the dynamics near depinning",
    "is spatially and temporally inhomogeneous , with coexistence of pinned and sliding degrees of freedom",
    ". the depinning transition may become discontinuous ( first order ) , possibly with a macroscopic hysteresis and switching between pinned and sliding states  @xcite .",
    "experiments on charge density waves show that varying the temperature leads to a transition from continuous depinning to hysteretic depinning with sharp switching between pinned and sliding states  @xcite .",
    "whether such phase slip effects occur in the bulk or only at the contacts  @xcite , remains to be clarified .",
    "related slip effects or plastic behavior have been proposed to explain the complex dynamics of many other dissipative systems , including vortex arrays in type - ii superconductors .",
    "lorentz microscopy images of driven vortex arrays in irradiated thin films of niobium show vortex rivers flowing past each other at the boundaries of pinned regions of the lattice  @xcite . scanning tunneling microscopy , which can resolve individual vortices at high density ,",
    "also reveals the evolution of the vortex dynamics with disorder strength  @xcite .",
    "there too , there are edge contamination effects , and they may be responsible for the coexistence of a metastable disordered phase and a stable ordered phase  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that more work is needed to understand the rich dynamics of driven systems in experiments .",
    "it was ubiquitously found in numerical studies of interacting particles driven on a random substrate at @xmath8 ( away from the weak - disorder limit ) that near the onset of mean sliding the motion occurs along filamentary channels or rivers that are determined by the spatial disorder of the random medium .",
    "such channels are preferentially aligned along the direction of mean motion , but can exhibit large transverse excursions . at higher mean - flow rates",
    "the rivers coalesce into a more coherent structure that eventually results in a uniform flow .",
    "hence the plastic flow takes , at a qualitative level , a variety of forms with increasing correlations : ( i ) filamentary flow with a single well - defined channel or several uncoupled channels  @xcite to coupled or synchronized channels , to a layered smectic type structure to a moving lattice which may or not still contain frozen or moving dislocations  @xcite . while one may hope that at large velocity , where the effective disorder is smaller , the flow is closer to the one described by an elastic model , it is clear that one needs to take into account plastic deformations to describe these various regimes .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the dynamics of such plastic systems is much less developed than that of driven elastic media .",
    "it is not even clear how to characterize the various moving states which are observed by some order parameter , and to properly define steady states and their large - size limit .",
    "one can measure the distribution of time - averaged velocities @xmath16 of the individual particles . a non - trivial @xmath16 exists for instance in the filamentary regime where some particle seem permamently pinned while others are moving along channels . in small systems with periodic boundary conditions a periodic steady state",
    "is observed near the threshold with a non - trivial @xmath16 .",
    "whether this feature persists in the infinite system limit , and how it depends e.g.  on the geometry and aspect ratio of the sample , is not known . as was recently pointed out @xcite , it is fruitful to apply tools and ideas from the theory of dynamical systems and chaos",
    ". it was found that upon increasing @xmath6 , the system undergoes a transition from periodic to a fully chaotic flow with positive lyapunov exponents and a non - trivial attractor .",
    "the dimension of this attractor , which is low , may also provide a tool to characterize the phases of plastic flow .",
    "these ideas remain to be explored , in particular whether the elastic flow could exhibit some chaotic regime . at larger drive ,",
    "@xmath16 becomes more peaked around a single velocity and some degree of spatial coherence in the phase accross the layers may arises . whether @xmath16 eventually becomes a delta function in the large - size limit , and whether the phase - coherence lengths diverge or not , has not been systemetically studied numerically .",
    "there has been some efforts to use numerical simulations to correlate the spatial and temporal structure of the dynamics with the shape of the macroscopic response  @xcite , for instance the iv characteristics due to flux flow in a type - ii superconductors .",
    "a number of mean - field models of driven extended systems with locally underdamped relaxation or phase slips have been proposed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "whether or not these dynamical models exhibit truly collective behavior and universality in finite dimensions remains an open question which motivated this work , as discussed below . a model which attempts to describe filamentary flow away from mean field",
    "was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "given the difficulty in describing topological defects , a simpler approach consists in considering layers such that deformations within a layer are only elastic .",
    "since the relative displacements between layers can be arbitrarily large , inter - layer plastic deformations are allowed . whether they occur or not depend on the interaction between the layers .",
    "this approach was successful to treat disorder in the statics , where it lead to solvable limits for e.g.  the bragg glass phase @xcite , the decoupling transition for magnetically coupled superconductors @xcite .",
    "it is also studied to describe interacting quantum systems such as the sliding luttinger liquid @xcite . recently",
    "a similar strategy was applied to describe plastic flow and depinning ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , and coupling phenomena in the driven dynamics @xcite .",
    "there it is even more natural since the flow naturally tends to be along layers ( which can be channels ) in the direction of the applied force . in one version of the model , introduced by one of us and collaborators , the layers are",
    "only _ viscously _ coupled in at least one of the directions transverse to the mean motion .",
    "although this is a much simplified version of plastic flow , for instance there are no convective terms in the equation of motion , it is motivated by the moving smectic phase in driven vortex lattices mentioned above .",
    "it incorporates elastic responses to compressional deformations and allows for local slips of neighboring degrees of freedom due to shear deformations .",
    "it is also relevant to experiments on driven superconducting vortices in narrow channels and other controlled geometries @xcite .",
    "one possible realization is a a layered ( e.g.  high @xmath17 ) superconductor when the vortices are aligned with the magnetic field within the @xmath18 , @xmath19-plane layers and move along these layers under a @xmath20-axis current . in the limit where the intrinsic pinning potential from the @xmath18 planes is strong compared to the weak isotropic disorder from point impurities , the vortex dynamics may be modeled in terms of @xmath21 elastic layers or `` channels '' coupled viscously along the @xmath20 axis .",
    "the fact that only the viscous coupling between layers is retained makes it more tractable .",
    "it is expected to be valid in situations where the commensurate density - density interlayer interaction , studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , which couples the displacements in each layer , can be neglected .",
    "the general case can be defined as follows : consider a @xmath22-dimensional medium composed of elastic @xmath23-dimensional channels coupled via viscous interactions in the remaining @xmath24 directions .",
    "the medium is driven by a uniform force @xmath25 applied along one of the directions in the @xmath23-dimensional channels . here",
    "we only consider the dynamics of a scalar displacement field @xmath26 describing deformations in the direction of the driving force at position @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 vectors in @xmath0 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 dimensions , respectively .",
    "to index the channels one discretizes spatial coordinates in the direction normal to the layers ( @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the @xmath33-th layer ) and let @xmath34 . the dynamics of the displacement @xmath35 of each degree of freedom is governed by the equation ,    @xmath36 + f + f_n({u_{n}}(x),x ) \\label{mlayermodel}\\ ] ]    this is the @xmath37-layer model . among the various universality classes of disorder ,",
    "the one of most interest here is the random periodic class where the pinning force has the form : @xmath38 with @xmath39 a periodic function .",
    "the pinning strengths @xmath40 are independent random variables distributed with probability @xmath41 and @xmath42 are random phases uniformly and independently distributed in @xmath43 . this models the dynamics of driven periodic media , such as vortex lattices , charge density waves , or wigner crystals . in these systems substrate impurities",
    "couple to the density of the lattice which , in the absence of in - layer topological defects , has the periodicity of the ordered lattice . as a result ,",
    "the pinning force contains periodic components at all reciprocal lattice vectors @xcite . in the bare model one can retain the lowest fourier components only , since as is well known from frg studies of statics and depinning , all fourier components are generated by coarse - graining and should be included to describe the properly renormalized disorder correlator .",
    "such a correlator develops cusp - like singularities at large scales that control the dynamics .",
    "the other type of disorder , the non - periodic or random - manifold class , which at the elastic depinning was shown to give rise to a single universality class encompassing both random bond ( i.e.  short - ranged ) and random field ( i.e.  long - ranged ) disorder , will also be studied .",
    "this is done by choosing a non - periodic correlator for the random forces @xmath44 .",
    "physical realizations are less obvious since the above velocity coupling is local in @xmath45 space only while a realistic coupling e.g.  between two directed polymers would also depend on the field @xmath46 .",
    "two possible realizations are : ( i ) manifolds with internal disorder , as studied in ref .  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) periodic systems for which the correlation length of the disorder @xmath47 is small compared to the lattice spacing @xmath48 .",
    "then the two scales for pinning , the larkin length @xmath49 , and @xmath50 for the decay of translational order , can be very different , and it is known that for scales @xmath51 all harmonics of the disorder correlator are important and the system behaves effectively as a random manifold within this range of scales @xcite . hence , below we also consider the nonperiodic or random - manifold model and discuss the different behaviors in the two cases .",
    "the layered model ( [ mlayermodel ] ) with viscous couplings was proposed as a generic coarse - grained model representative of a class of dissipative driven systems with strong disorder that encompasses many of the models considered in the literature .",
    "it was solved within mean - field theory and shown to predict a qualitative change from continuous to discontinuous and hysteretic dynamics as a function of disorder strength , consistent with experimental observations in a variety of systems @xcite .",
    "it has also been studied numerically in finite dimensions .",
    "the numerical studies show evidence of hysteresis in 2 + 1 dimensions above a critical value of the interlayer coupling .",
    "hysteresis was not clearly evident , however , in 1 + 1 dimensions nor for the two - layer model studied below , although it could also not be conclusively ruled out on the basis of finite - size scaling @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to go beyong the mean - field treatment of model ( [ mlayermodel ] ) and explore using functional rg whether hysteretic dynamics also occurs and whether universal features emerge in low dimensions where one usually does not expect the mean - field approximation to be accurate .",
    "since generalization to @xmath37 layers is straightforward and not expected to bring important qualitative changes , we study in detail the technically simpler case of two viscously coupled layers @xmath52 .",
    "we start by recalling in section [ sec : mft ] the main features of the mean - field solution so as to provide a basis for comparison . in section",
    "[ sec : oneloop ] we study the @xmath52 model first by direct perturbation theory and next using 1-loop frg .",
    "we prove that the elastic single - layer ( i.e.  decoupled layer ) quasi - static @xmath53 depinning fixed point is _ always unstable _ to a small viscous inter - layer coupling .",
    "a partial one - loop analysis at @xmath14 shows the generic co - existence of a pinned and a moving state below the single - layer depinning threshold .",
    "the resulting @xmath13 curves show similarities with the mean - field ones , and in some regimes the agreement can even be made quantitative .",
    "we estimate the velocity @xmath54 at which the @xmath13 curve becomes vertical ( and a jump may occur in the fixed force ensemble ) .",
    "a key feature of the one - loop study is that the inter - layer viscous coupling @xmath55 is _ not corrected _ by disorder . to determine whether this is maintained to higher order",
    ", we carry in section [ sec : twoloop ] the frg to two loops , near the uncoupled elastic quasi - static depinning .",
    "the analysis gives a strong correction as compared to one loop in the non - periodic class , i.e.  random manifolds , with a new universality class for plastic depinning whose @xmath56 exponent is computed in section [ subsec : nonper ] .",
    "the analysis in the periodic case is quite subtle and presented in section [ subsec : per ] . finally , to get a better understanding of possible behaviors and of the connection between dynamical hysteresis and attractors in phase space in simpler cases",
    ", we study in section [ sec : toy ] two @xmath4 toy models of two viscously coupled particles on , respectively , a smooth ( section [ subsec : smooth ] ) and a discontinuous ( section [ subsec : scalloped ] ) force landscape .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : discussion ] the main results are summarized , and extensions and future directions discussed . in particular it is proved that a small interlayer commensurate coupling is irrelevant at depinning .",
    "since such a term is always present in real systems , this shows that the viscous model is consistent .",
    "the appendices contain the details of the two - loop calculation and a proof that stable static configurations where decoupled layers are independently pinned remain dynamically stable in presence of the inter - layer viscous coupling .",
    "let us now define the two - layer model studied here , and fix notations .",
    "we consider the overdamped dynamics of two layers coupled by a viscous coupling in a random potential .",
    "each layer is an elastic system parameterized by a one - component ( @xmath12 ) displacement field @xmath57 , also denoted @xmath58 , for @xmath59 , or @xmath60 to indicate explicitly the dependence on time .",
    "the equation of motion of one layer is @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the in - layer friction coefficient .",
    "hence , in addition to elastic intra - layer restoring forces ( elastic coefficient @xmath20 ) and the quenched random pinning force , one layer is also pulled by the other layer through a velocity ( or viscous ) coupling @xmath63 . here",
    "we focus on the case of uncorrelated disorder in each layer , and denote the second cumulant of the pinning forces by @xmath64 the equation of motion for the system of two layers driven by an external force @xmath6 can then be written as : @xmath65 the bare values for the friction matrix are @xmath66",
    "to set up the mean - field theory for the multi - layered model , it is convenient to discretize space in both the transverse and longitudinal directions , using integer vectors @xmath67 for the @xmath23-dimensional intra - layer index .",
    "the local displacement along the direction of motion at time @xmath68 is @xmath69 , with @xmath70 the layer index and @xmath71 labeling the degrees of freedom within each layer .",
    "its dynamics is governed by the equation ( in this section we drop the subscript @xmath72 on the bare frictions ) , @xmath73     + \\sum_{j }     \\eta_{ij}[\\dot{u}^j_{\\ell}(t)-\\dot{u}^i_{\\ell}(t)]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + f+h^i_\\ell y(u^i_\\ell(t)-\\beta^i_\\ell)\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is a periodic function and @xmath75 and @xmath76 have constant values @xmath20 and @xmath77 , respectively , for nearest - neighbor pairs and vanish otherwise .",

    "the mean displacement and velocity are given by @xmath87 and we look for solutions moving with a uniform velocity so that ( up to a choice of the origin of time ) @xmath88 since the displacements are coupled only through the mean fields , they can be indexed by their disorder parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 , rather than by the spatial indices @xmath82 , @xmath85 , i.e. , @xmath91 . the mean - field dynamics is governed by the equation @xmath92 that must be solved with the self - consistency condition that determines the mean field , @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the average over disorder .    the long - time steady - state solution to eq .",

    "the calculation is based on certain assumptions ( discussed in section [ sec : twoloop ] , i.e.  the neglect of violations of middleton s theorem , the neglect of higher orders in the region of small @xmath540 ) and more work is clearly needed to ascertain its validity . however , as a preliminary step it indicates a new universality class in the case of non - periodic objects and in the periodic case , a possible breakdown of the 1-loop picture depending on how irrelevant operators are taken into account .",
    "this possible alternative picture is the absence of a dynamical hysteresis and a nearly vertical @xmath13 curve near the elastic threshold .    in an attempt to understand which",
    "effects could be missed by the mean field and 1-loop approaches , we have solved simple toy models in @xmath4 .",
    "we found indeed that dynamical hysteresis may or may not be present , depending on the realization of disorder .",
    "although in all cases considered one finds a periodic trajectory with non - zero velocity which survives below the elastic ( uncoupled ) threshold , this trajectory may be attractive or repulsive depending on the disorder realization .",
    "it remains to be studied in detail how these properties carry to a larger number of degrees of freedom . in any case",
    "it can not be assumed that a single attractive periodic attractor exists and a detailed study of such attractors as the number of particles increases must be done with care before any conclusion can be drawn .",
    "the particle models also show the importance of the zero - force points in phase space .",
    "these are couples of configurations in the two layers @xmath541 where all forces vanish .",
    "they are defined in the statics , hence are independent of the viscous coupling .",
    "however it is important to know their dynamical stability in presence of a viscous coupling .",
    "it is proved in appendix [ app : theorem ] that metastable states , i.e.  stable states where the energy has a local minimum , remain stable , i.e.  dynamically attractive , at non - zero viscous coupling .",
    "this means that each pinned state , i.e.  blocking configuration for each uncoupled layer , keeps a non - zero basin of attraction when the viscous coupling is increased from zero . in the absence of a viscous coupling ,",
    "when upon increasing @xmath6 such a pinned state becomes unstable , the next configuration is determined by the no - passing rule and middleton s theorem , as the minimum over @xmath46 of all metastable configurations in the direction of the force . in the presence of a viscous coupling however , there is no guarantee that the system will not flow from there to a periodic orbit , resulting in a jump in the @xmath13 curve . thus even if the metastable zero - force couples remain attractive , they may not be easily _ dynamically accessible _ , i.e.  their basin of attraction may shrink and be nearly invisible in a procedure such as force ramping .",
    "these effects , as well as the competition between the zero - force fixed points and the periodic orbits , clearly remain to be studied systematically .",
    "it is thus a remaining challenge to understand how the frg can describe the structure of such a complicated phase space with periodic orbits coexisting with pinned fixed points .",
    "it is probable that the frg calculation presented here retains only averaged effects and does not adress these issues with sufficient accuracy .",
    "one possible geometry to study this in a controlled manner starting with a particle and then extending to manifolds is to use the drive by an harmonic well .",
    "since the coupling between the layers exists only when the system is moving , one needs to go beyond the present calculation and study for instance how the avalanches in the two layers are correlated .    in a broader context",
    ", one needs to justify why effort should be devoted to clarify the behaviour of this simple two - layer model with viscous coupling only .",
    "this model indeed neglects the competition between plastic inter - layer and elastic intra - layer couplings , and one should question its range of validity . since any small realistic interaction between two identical elastic layers , such as a crystal or a cdw in the absence of in - layer topological defects ( which we have not included here ) generates some small inter - layer commensurate coupling",
    ", one should ask whether our model is stable to that .",
    "this can be analyzed by adding a force @xmath542 , with @xmath543 , to the equation of motion ( [ y2 ] ) of layer 1 , and its opposite for layer 2 .",
    "such a coupling generates an elastic coupling at small scale between the layers , and if it is relevant in the rg sense , at large scales as well . in the latter situation",
    "the elastic coupling sould dominate the viscous one and one expects that the system is described by elastic depinning .",
    "it was found in mean - field models that such a coupling is always relevant in the moving phase @xcite .",
    "if such a result were general , the model studied here would be somewhat artificial , or describe only a limited range of length scales .",
    "it is easy to compute , to 1-loop accuracy and for any @xmath274 , the linear eigenvalue of an infinitesimal perturbation @xmath544 at the unperturbed quasi - static depinning fixed point at @xmath53 studied here . a first ( and naive ) calculation in the spirit of the statics yields : @xmath545 \\tilde g_1 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath546 is the dimensionless coupling .",
    "this is essentially the result obtained for the problem of a single layer in presence of both disorder and a commensurate potential @xcite up to a factor of two which accounts for the fact that the disorder exists in both layers , compared to @xcite .",
    "inserting the value of @xmath547 at the 1-loop depinning fixed point implies that this coupling is always relevant near @xmath213 which would seem to confirm the mean - field conclusion .",
    "it also yields a critical dimension near @xmath548 , i.e.  @xmath549 below which the coupling should become irrelevant .",
    "this conclusion is correct for the statics , but incorrect near the depinning threshold .    at depinning at least two new effects",
    "should be taken into account .",
    "first , one sees that the coupling @xmath550 generates in perturbation theory a correction to the critical force , which amounts to adding _ the same _ force @xmath551 , with @xmath543 , to the equation of motion ( [ y2 ] ) of each layer .",
    "these two terms feed into each others and the correct linearized rg equation takes the form , to one loop : @xmath552 second , and most importantly , from the two - loop solution of the standard depinning fixed point @xcite , we know that @xmath553 does not flow to a fixed point , it always increases as @xmath554 .",
    "physically , a _",
    "static random force _ is generated by the quenched disorder in the limit @xmath53 .",
    "this is due to terms in the two - loop beta - function which account for the irreversibility of depinning , and is at variance with the statics @xcite . at depinning however ,",
    "a small coupling between layers is always irrelevant for @xmath3 .",
    "this can be seen from ( [ eigenmat ] ) , since @xmath553 grows while @xmath555 converges to a @xmath409 fixed point .",
    "it justifies a posteriori the model studied in this paper .",
    "of course at larger bare couplings it is likely that a coupled phase will arise and it would be interesting to study that transition@xcite .",
    "let us finish by recalling that one issue in the theory of plastic flow is whether one can use @xmath16 , the distribution of time - averaged individual particle velocities , as a meaningful order parameter in the thermodynamics limit .",
    "one could then distinguish two classes of plastic flow ( i ) flows with non - trivial @xmath16 ( e.g.  pinned particles coexisting with flowing rivers ) ( ii ) flows with peaked @xmath16 ( a delta function in the large - size limit ) but which can not be described by a fully elastic theory .",
    "the layered model studied here is a tractable example of class ( ii ) and requires , to exhibit a non - zero depinning threshold , elastic interactions inside the layers . models for class ( i ) have been studied , where particles interact only through a hard core interaction @xcite",
    ". it would be quite interesting to find a tractable model which encompasses both classes and their possible transitions .",

    "we have introduced the hessian @xmath559 in each layer , which are hermitian matrices .",
    "they have eigenvalues @xmath560 and eigenvectors @xmath561 . in the absence of a coupling between the layers ( @xmath562 ) the eigenvalues @xmath560 are proportional to the lyapunov exponents , i.e.  @xmath563 .",
    "a question is how they vary as the viscous coupling is increased .",
    "note that one can decompose : @xmath564    and in that basis the equation of motion reads : @xmath565    since the velocity coupling between layers is local in space , it becomes non - local in the eigenstates of the two hessians .",
    "the matrix @xmath37 has several interesting properties . although it is not hermitian , since @xmath117 and @xmath495 do not commute , its eigenvalues are real .",

    "consider now a bare model such that @xmath571 is strictly positive definite with eigenvalues @xmath572 , @xmath573 , i.e.  @xmath574 .",
    "then ( [ lambda2 ] ) implies that the sign of @xmath528 is the same as the sign of @xmath569 .",
    "let us consider a stable ( i.e.  attractive ) zero - force point with all @xmath575 , hence @xmath495 is strictly negative definite . in its neighborhood in phase space , in the absence of viscous coupling between layers ,",
    "the system is pinned . since @xmath576 for any non - zero @xmath10 , the above property implies that the zero - force fixed point remains stable , i.e.  all lyapunov exponents remain strictly negative , as the viscous coupling between layers @xmath574 is increased , and ( [ lambda2 ] ) implies the bounds @xmath577 for a model with @xmath578 , and where @xmath579 and @xmath580 are the smallest and largest eigen - values of @xmath581 .",
    "these eigenvalues of stability can be obtained exactly in the case where @xmath582 and @xmath583 commute",
    ". then one can choose the same basis in both layers @xmath584 .",
    "the lyapunov exponents , i.e.  the eigenvalues @xmath528 in @xmath585 of ( [ linear ] ) can then be organized in pairs with:@xmath586and one checks that as long as @xmath587 a stable fp remains stable as @xmath588 is increased ( this holds for the two - particle model considered above ) . in general one",
    "does not expect @xmath582 and @xmath583 to commute , since the disorders in the two layers are uncorrelated .",
    "for small interlayer coupling one can apply second - order perturbation theory:@xmath589{\\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which always makes the smallest eigenvalue ( assumed all positive ) get closer to zero , but even in the most dangerous case when this eigenvalue is near marginal , i.e.  @xmath590 near zero , the second - order correction vanishes as @xmath591 .",
    "hence there is no mecanism for it to cross zero .",
    "this is not too surprising since the determinant of the matrix in ( [ linear ] ) can not change sign as @xmath592 is increased . since the eigenvalues remain real ( as shown above )",
    "they can not continuously change sign . hence , as above , we conclude that a stable zero - force fixed - point remains stable .",
    "both the size ( in phase space ) of its basin of attraction ( pinned phase ) and the lyapunov exponent may decrease with increasing interlayer coupling , but they do not cross zero .    finally note that if e.g.  @xmath582 has a marginal direction , i.e.  @xmath593 , then @xmath594 is an eigenvector of @xmath37 with zero eigenvalue . hence a marginal direction remains marginal .",
    "in this appendix we derive the frg equations up to two loops using the method of ref.@xcite .",
    "all calculations are done at zero velocity , at the depinning transition .",
    "all static quantities like the disorder correlator are the same as for the standard depinning transition , and we refer to @xcite for details . here",
    "we only calculate the corrections to friction , i.e.corrections to @xmath225 and @xmath222 .",

    "we observe that subtracting the term at @xmath631 , the diagram has no longer a subdivergence . in order to proceed ,",
