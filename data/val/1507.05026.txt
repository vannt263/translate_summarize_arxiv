    "the geometry of the black hole is regarded as classical , with quantum fields propagating on a background space - time metric .",

    "the black holes of phenomenological interest for high - energy collisions either have a single axis of rotation which lies in the brane or are non - rotating . in both these cases , the symmetries of the brane black hole space - time mean that the components of @xmath1 which comprise the hawking fluxes of energy and angular momentum on the brane do not require renormalization @xcite .    even in four space - time dimensions , computing the full renormalized expectation value of the stress - energy tensor for a quantum field on a background black hole space - time is a complicated process @xcite . in more than four space - time dimensions , decanini and folacci @xcite have developed a general formalism for the computation of @xmath5 for a quantum scalar field @xmath6 based on hadamard renormalization .",
