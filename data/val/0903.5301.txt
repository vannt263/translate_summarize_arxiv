    "that early - type galaxies form a well - defined color magnitude relation ( cmr ) was first recognized by @xcite .",
    "extensive studies by @xcite and @xcite compared the cmr of nine galaxy clusters and of field galaxies .",
    "they found them to be astonishingly similar . in combination with other studies comparing the cmr for e and s0 , within clusters , groups and the field @xcite a high degree of universality",
    "was shown for the relation .",
    "the cmr is typically explained by an increase of mean stellar metallicity with increasing galaxy mass as the dominant effect .",
    "the common underlying idea is that more massive galaxies have deeper potential wells , which can retain metal - enriched stellar ejecta more effectively and subsequently recycle the enriched gas into new stars .",
    "another factor could be a variable integrated galactic initial mass function , with more massive stars in more massive galaxies , and thus a more substantial enrichment ( e.g.  ) .",
    "an alternative explanation was given with a change of the mean age ( see e.g. @xcite , and some observational support for it in @xcite ) .",
    "the question of which explanation to favor is not totally settled yet due to the ambiguity introduced by the age - metallicity degeneracy . but",
    "data from clusters at higher redshift show that the cmr is in place ever since , favoring the mass - metallicity relation to be the dominant effect .    from early on",
    ", it was discussed whether the universality of the cmr also holds over the whole range of galaxy masses , i.e.  whether dwarf and giant early - type galaxies follow the same cmr .",
    "studies of different clusters show consistency with one common cmr for dwarfs and giants , albeit with a significant increase in the scatter at low luminosities ( @xcite for coma , @xcite for perseus , @xcite and for fornax , @xcite for antlia and for hydra i ) .",
    "more explicitely , @xcite stated that there is a common linear relation .",
    "but his fig .",
    "3 might hint at a change of slope from high to low luminosities , similar to what @xcite suggested .",
    "interestingly , visual examination of the diagrams presented by most of the above - mentioned studies indicates consistency also with a change of slope ",
    "yet linear relations were fitted in most cases ( see , however , @xcite ; see sect .",
    "5 ) . in this letter",
    "we revisit the question of the universality of the cmr for dwarfs and giants .",
    "the sample is based on the virgo cluster catalog ( vcc ; @xcite ) .",
    "all early - type galaxies therein with a certain cluster member status and @xmath4 mag are taken into account , which is the same magnitude limit up to which the vcc was found to be complete .",
    "this translates into @xmath5 mag with our adopted distance modulus of m - m=31.09 mag ( d=16.5 mpc , @xcite ) .",
    "we treat uncertain classifications as in @xcite and exclude possible irregulars .",
    "seven further galaxies are exluded due to their low @xmath6 in @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release five ( dr5 ) @xcite covers all but six early - type dwarf galaxies of the vcc . since the quality of sky level subtraction of the sdss pipeline is insufficient , we use sky - subtracted images as provided by @xcite , based on a careful subtraction method .",
    "the images were flux - calibrated and corrected for galactic extinction @xcite .    for each galaxy , we determined a ",
    "petrosian semimajor axis \" ( @xcite , hereafter petrosian sma , @xmath9 ) , i.e. , we use ellipses instead of circles in the calculation of the petrosian radius ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the total flux in the @xmath10-band was measured within @xmath11 , yielding a value for the half - light semimajor axis , @xmath12 .",
    "this petrosian aperture still misses some flux , which is of particular relevance for the giant galaxies @xcite .",
    "the brightness and the half - light sma were corrected for this missing flux according to @xcite .",
    "axial ratio and position angle were then determined through an isophotal fit at @xmath13 .",
    "colors were measured within the elliptical @xmath10-band half - light aperture for each filter .",
    "errors were estimated from the @xmath6 and calibration uncertainties ( which we estimate to have a _ relative _ effect of 0.1 mag in each band , which is smaller than the absolute values given by sdss ) , as described in @xcite .",
    "our data constitute a very homogeneous set of measurements for galaxies in one cluster , obtained and reduced with the same instrument , setup , and software .",
    "from the five sdss filter bands we choose four representative colors : @xmath0 , mostly sensitive to age ; @xmath1 with the highest @xmath6 ; @xmath2 with the longest wavelength baseline at good @xmath6 ; and @xmath3 , mostly sensitive to metallicity .",
    "first of all , the impression one can get by examining just the _ black points _ in fig .  1 is that there is not one common linear relation from the faint to the bright galaxies . in all colors",
    "the overall shape appears more like `` s '' shaped .",
    "the brightest ( @xmath14 ) galaxies have almost constant color , i.e.  no correlation between color and brightness ; the very brightest galaxies show a larger scatter .",
    "these were reported before to be _ morphologically _ different from the other galaxies in more detailed studies of the inner light profiles ( e.g. @xcite ) . for the remaining galaxies several descriptions seem to be plausible , ranging from just an offset between two relations with similar slopes up to a curved relation .    with the non - linear shape , it seems not very favorable to fit a straight line .",
    "this would not describe the data well , and there is no theoretical prediction what other function is expected .",
    "so at first , we want to make the overall shape more clearly visible , using continous , overlapping magnitude bins , in which mean and scatter are calculated . in fig .",
    "1 these derived relations are shown with grey lines .",
    "the first impression is confirmed : one common linear relation for dwarfs and giants can not be seen .",
    "moreover , the white histograms showing the galaxy distributions in the bins are clearly peaked towards the bright and the faint end , while they are rather flat at intermediate luminosity .",
    "if the notion of two separate relations with an overlap is correct , this should become evident through an increased scatter about the relation around the intersection , relative to the photometric error .",
    "therefore we calculate the rms of the scatter around the mean in running bins ( clipping one time at 3@xmath15 ) and divide it by the rms of the photometric errors @xmath16 with color @xmath17 and mean color @xmath18 , averaging over the galaxies in the respective bin . here",
    "we exclude des with blue cores , since they are known to have different colors @xcite",
    ". this rms - ratio should be one if the scatter is only due to the measurement errors and larger than one if there is an intrinsic scatter . in fig .  1 we show the cmrs along with the rms - ratio @xmath19 .    indeed , the rms - ratio is enhanced between @xmath20 , indicating an intrinsically increased scatter , which could in principle be explained by a transition between two separate relations .",
    "but the change is steady .",
    "thus also alternative explanations , such as a more varied star formation history with decreasing galaxy mass , seem plausible  although the decrease in the scatter for the faintest dwarfs would still need to be explained .    one can argue about the significance of the rms - ratio increase for the brightest galaxies , since it is just a handful of them  nevertheless , this larger scatter might be related to the absence of a well - defined cmr at the brightest magnitudes .",
    "the numerical galaxy catalog of @xcite is based on a high resolution @xmath21-body simulation in a @xmath22cdm universe @xcite .",
    "the dark - halo merger trees of the @xmath21-body simulation are taken as input for a semi - analytical model ( sam ) of galaxy formation ( here a modified version of the mitaka model , @xcite ) .",
    "the sam models physical processes of galaxy formation and evolution such as gas radiative cooling , star formation , heating by supernova explosions ( supernova feedback ) , mergers of galaxies , population synthesis , and extinction by internal dust and intervening hi clouds .",
    "in particular , the model takes into account the dynamical response to starburst - induced gas removal after gas - rich mergers ( also for cases intermediate between a purely baryonic cloud and a baryonic cloud fully supported by surrounding dark matter as in ) .",
    "the gravitational well is shallower for the dwarf galaxies and thus they suffer a more substantial gas loss than giants .",
    "this process is not only important for the galaxy sizes , but also for their metal enrichment histories .    in the comparison of the cmr of the virgo galaxies with the sam ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the shapes of the distributions are fairly similar , and the model cmr is indeed not well represented by a linear relation . in @xcite we presented an analogous comparison for the scaling relation of radius and brightness and found that the model qualitatively agrees with distribution of the galaxies in that diagram . both the cmr and the relation between size and brightness do not show a linear , nor one common behaviour for dwarfs and giants .",
    "nevertheless , in the framework of the sam both can be explained by the same physical processes , which govern @xmath22cdm structure formation , and thus both can be of cosmological origin ( see also @xcite ) .    beside the good agreement in the overall shape , an offset is observed .",
    "this offset could partly be due to uncertainties of the adopted synthetic stellar population model .",
    "vs. @xmath23 ( for which no transformations are needed ) the observed galaxies lie bluewards of the model ones with an smaller absolute offset than in @xmath24 vs. @xmath25 , but the scatter of the observed galaxies is larger due to the lower @xmath6 in the @xmath8-band . ]",
    "furthermore , the relative number of bright galaxies exceeds the observed one and the luminosity function is clearly different , which could possibly be explained with model input physics .",
    "in the literature , there is no consistent view of commonness or distinctness of the color magnitude relation of dwarf and giant early - type galaxies .",
    "some studies find a linear relation over the whole range of brightness , others find a change of slope .",
    "we studied the cmr of virgo cluster early - type galaxies , based on the wealth of sdss imaging data in multiple filter bands .",
    "our main result is that the dwarfs and giants do not follow one common _ linear _ relation .",
    "the appearance in the different colors , from @xmath0 to @xmath3 , is very similar , suggesting that age and metallicity go hand in hand : the cmr at shorter wavelengths is more sensitive to changes in age , while it is more sensitive to changes in metallicity at longer wavelengths .",
    "recent studies indeed claim that a combination of the effects of age , metallicity and also @xmath26-enhancement shape the cmr @xcite .",
    "the most direct comparison with other data is possible with @xcite , who studied early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster with the hubble space telescope s advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in the acs virgo cluster survey . in their fig .",
    "123 they show the cmr in @xmath27 , using smaller apertures for the color measurements .",
    "for comparison we repeat the plot and indicate galaxies common to both samples with black dots in the symbols ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "we also show their fits ( to their data ) : two linear fits to a brighter and fainter subsample and one parabola for the whole sample .",
    "while a qualitatively good agreement is found , the small offset to bluer colors of our data is likely explained by a combination of the effect of different apertures , the atmosphere , and different physical filters . while we agree with @xcite that the cmr is not linear over the whole range , the faint dwarfs in our sample , which they do not reach ( cf .",
    "3 ) , do not lie on the extrapolation of their parabolic fit , but rather define an overall `` s''-like shape .",
    "furthermore , some of the galaxies that might drag their cmr to the blue side , at their faint end , display blue cores from recent star formation activity @xcite , which we excluded .",
    "we found an increase of the scatter about the cmr at intermediate brightness , visible in fig .  1 through a broadening of the color distributions within the respective magnitude bins .",
    "this confirms the result that dwarfs and giants do _ not _ share one common _ linear _ cmr . for the brighter and fainter galaxies",
    "the scatter is closer to the photometric errors .",
    "@xcite concluded that the cmr is a result of two more fundamental relations : the faber - jackson relation and a relation between color and velocity dispersion .",
    "given the slope change of the faber - jackson relation from giants to dwarfs a change of slope of the cmr would actually be expected .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the curved shape of the cmr , and the possible existence of two adjacent relations does _ not _ necessarily imply different formation scenarios of dwarfs and giants .",
    "this is in accordance with previous claims of no distinction between them ( ) . instead , from the good qualitative agreement of the observed cmr shape with a semi - analytic model ,",
    "we conclude that a common origin within the framework of @xmath22cdm structure formation appears plausible for both giant _ and _ dwarf early types .",
    "a more detailed multiparameter comparison of dwarfs and giants will be communicated in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we thank masahiro nagashima for helpful advice , and the referee for useful comments . we are supported within the framework of the excellence initiative by the german research foundation ( dfg ) through the heidelberg graduate school of fundamental physics ( grant number gsc 129/1 ) .",
    "the study is based on sdss ( http://www.sdss.org/ ) ."
