    "for example , the dirac - coulomb equation , which predicts the spectroscopy and structure of hydrogenic atoms has an analog in hadron physics in the form of relativistic frame - independent equations of motion derived from light - front holography  @xcite which give a remarkable first approximation to the spectroscopy , dynamics , and structure of light hadrons .",

    "these resonances can account  @xcite for the large spin - spin @xmath35 correlations  @xcite observed at the strangeness @xmath36 gev and @xmath37 gev and charm thresholds .    at high energies , compton scattering on an atom @xmath38",
    "is dominated by the thomson amplitude  the elastic scattering of the photon on the atomic electrons .",
    "the analog in hadron physics is the scattering of photons on quarks @xmath39 via a local seagull or instantaneous light - front term or which gives an energy - independent contribution to the compton amplitude proportional to the charge squared of the struck quark  a contribution which has no analog in hadron scattering reactions .",
    "llanes - estrada , szczepaniak , and i  @xcite have shown that this local contribution has a real phase and is universal , giving the same contribution for real or virtual compton scattering for any photon virtuality and skewness at fixed momentum transfer squared @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41-dependence of this @xmath42 fixed regge pole is parameterized by a yet unmeasured even charge - conjugation form factor of the target nucleon .",
    "the @xmath43 limit gives an important constraint on the dependence of the nucleon mass on the quark mass through the weisberger relation .",
    "the same @xmath42 amplitude enters the two - photon exchange contribution to muon - proton scattering , and thus also could contribute an important contribution to the @xmath44 lamb shift .",
    "a key difficulty in making precise perturbative predictions for qcd is the uncertainty in determining the renormalization scale @xmath45 of the running coupling @xmath46 . in the standard gell - mann  low scheme for qed ,",
    "the renormalization scale is simply the virtuality of the virtual photon  @xcite .",
    "although the _ initial _ choice of renormalization scale @xmath47 is arbitrary , the _ final _ scale @xmath41 which sums the vacuum polarization corrections is unique and unambiguous .",
    "the resulting perturbative series is identical to the conformal series with zero @xmath48-function . in the case of muonic atoms ,",
    "the modified muon - nucleus coulomb potential is precisely @xmath49 i.e. , @xmath50 again , the renormalization scale is unique .",
    "the same principle underlying renormalization scale - setting in qed for @xmath51 must also hold in qcd since the @xmath52 terms in the qcd @xmath48 function have the same role as the lepton @xmath53 vacuum polarization contributions in qed .",
    "thus the same scale - setting procedure must be applicable to all renormalizable gauge theories .",
    "the purpose of the running coupling in any gauge theory is to sum all terms involving the @xmath48 function ; in fact , when the renormalization scale @xmath45 is set properly , all non - conformal @xmath54 terms in a perturbative expansion arising from renormalization are summed into the running coupling . the remaining terms in the perturbative series are then identical to that of a conformal theory ; i.e. , the theory with @xmath55 . the divergent  renormalon \" series of order @xmath56 does not appear in the conformal series .",
    "thus as in quantum electrodynamics , the renormalization scale @xmath45 is determined unambiguously by the  principle of maximal conformality ( pmc ) \"  @xcite .",
    "this is also the principle underlying blm scale setting  @xcite an important feature of the pmc is that its qcd predictions are independent of the choice of renormalization scheme .",
    "the pmc procedure also agrees with qed scale - setting in the @xmath57 limit .",
    "the distributions of electrons within an atom are determined in qed using the schrdinger wavefunction , the eigenfunction of the qed hamiltonian . in principle",
    ", one could calculate hadronic spectroscopy and wavefunctions by solving for the eigenstates of the qcd hamiltonian : @xmath58 at fixed time @xmath59 however , this traditional method  called the  instant `` form '' by dirac ,  @xcite is plagued by complex vacuum and relativistic effects , as well as by the fact that the boost of such fixed-@xmath41 wavefunctions away from the hadron s rest frame is an intractable dynamical problem .",
    "however , there is an extraordinarily powerful non - perturbative alternative  quantization at fixed light - front ( lf ) time @xmath60  the  front - form \" of dirac .",
    "@xcite in this framework each hadron @xmath61 is identified as an eigenstate of the qcd hamiltonian @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is derived directly from the qcd lagrangian or action .",
    "the eigenvalues of this heisenberg equation give the complete mass spectrum of hadrons .",
    "the eigensolution @xmath64 projected on the free fock basis provides the set of valence and non - valence light - front fock state wavefunctions @xmath65 , which describe the hadron s momentum and spin distributions and the direct measures of its structure at the quark and gluon level . if one quantizes the gluon field in light - cone gauge @xmath66 , the gluons have physical polarization @xmath67 , there are no ghosts , so that one has a physical interpretation of the quark and gluon constituents . the constituents of a bound state in a light - front wavefunction",
    "are measured at the same light - front time @xmath21  along the front of a light - wave , as in a flash picture .",
    "in contrast , the constituents of a bound state in an instant form wavefunction must be measured at the same instant time @xmath41 - - this requires the exact synchrony in time of many simultaneous probes .",
    "a remarkable feature of lfwfs is the fact that they are frame independent ; i.e. , the form of the lfwf is independent of the hadron s total momentum @xmath68 and @xmath69 the boost invariance of lfwfs contrasts dramatically with the complexity of boosting the wavefunctions defined at fixed time @xmath59",
    "@xcite light - front quantization is thus the ideal framework to describe the structure of hadrons in terms of their quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "the constituent spin and orbital angular momentum properties of the hadrons are also encoded in the lfwfs .",
    "the total angular momentum projection  @xcite @xmath70 is conserved fock - state by fock - state and by every interaction in the lf hamiltonian .",
    "the constituent spin and orbital angular momentum properties of the hadrons are thus encoded in their lfwfs .",
    "the empirical observation that quarks carry only a small fraction of the nucleon angular momentum highlights the importance of quark orbital angular momentum .",
    "in fact the nucleon anomalous moment and the pauli form factor are zero unless the quarks carry nonzero @xmath71 .",
    "hadron observables , e.g. , hadronic structure functions , form factors , distribution amplitudes , gpds , tmds , and wigner distributions can be computed as simple convolutions of light - front wavefunctions ( lfwfs ) .",
    "for example , one can calculate the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors @xmath72 and @xmath73 of a hadron from the drell - yan - west formula  i.e. , the overlap of lfwfs .",
    "the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment @xmath74 defined from the spin - flip matrix element @xmath73 at @xmath75 vanishes  consistent with the equivalence theorem of gravity .",
    "in contrast , in the instant form , the overlap of instant time wavefunctions is not sufficient .",
    "one must also couple the photon probe to currents arising spontaneously from the vacuum which are connected to the hadron s constituents .",
    "the light - front method is directly applicable for describing atomic bound states in both the relativistic and nonrelativistic domains ; it is particularly useful for atoms in flight since the lfwfs are frame - independent",
    ". it also satisfies theorems such as cluster decomposition .",
    "one can solve the lf hamiltonian problem for theories in one - space and one - time by heisenberg matrix diagonalization .",
    "for example , the complete set of discrete and continuum eigensolutions of mesons and baryons in qcd(1 + 1 ) can be obtained to any desired precision for general color , multiple flavors , and general quark masses using the discretized light - cone quantized ( dlcq ) method .",
    "@xcite the dlcq approach can in principle be applied to qed(3 + 1 ) and qcd(3 + 1 ) ; however , in practice , the huge matrix diagonalization problem is computational challenging .",
    "recently a new nonperturbative qcd approach has been developed which leads to an elegant analytical and phenomenologically compelling first approximation to the full lf hamiltonian method  light - front holography \" .",
    "@xcite light front holographic methods allow one to project the functional dependence of the wavefunction @xmath76 computed in the ads fifth dimension to the hadronic frame - independent light - front wavefunction @xmath77 in @xmath78 physical space - time .",
    "the variable @xmath79 maps to a transverse lf variable @xmath80 .",
    "the result is a single - variable light - front schrdinger equation which determines the eigenspectrum and the lfwfs of hadrons for general spin and orbital angular momentum .",
    "the transverse coordinate @xmath81 is closely related to the invariant mass squared of the constituents in the lfwf and its off - shellness in the lf kinetic energy , and it is thus the natural variable to characterize the hadronic wavefunction .",
    "in fact @xmath81 is the only variable to appear in the relativistic light - front schrdinger equations predicted from holographic qcd in the limit of zero quark masses .",
    "the coordinate @xmath82 in ads space is thus uniquely identified with a lorentz - invariant coordinate @xmath81 which measures the separation of the constituents within a hadron at equal light - front time .",
    "the hadron eigenstates generally have components with different orbital angular momentum ; e.g. , the proton eigenstate in lf holographic qcd with massless quarks has @xmath83 and @xmath84 light - front fock components with equal probability .",
    "higher fock states with extra quark - anti quark pairs also arise .",
    "the resulting lfwfs then lead to a new range of hadron phenomenology , including the possibility to compute the hadronization of quark and gluon jets at the amplitude level .",
    "the soft - wall model also predicts the form of the non - perturbative effective coupling and its @xmath48-function .",
    "a well - known phenomenon in qed rescattering via final - state coulomb interactions .",
    "although the coulomb phase for a given partial wave is infinite , the interference of coulomb phases arising from different partial waves leads to observable effects .",
    "the calculation of the sivers single - spin asymmetry in deep inelastic lepton scattering in qcd is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sivers ] .",
    "the analysis requires two different orbital angular momentum components : @xmath85-wave with the quark - spin parallel to the proton spin and @xmath86-wave for the quark with anti - parallel spin ; the difference between the final - state ",
    "coulomb \" phases leads to a @xmath87 correlation of the proton s spin with the virtual photon - to - quark production plane  @xcite .",
    "thus , as it is clear from its qed analog , the final - state gluonic interactions of the scattered quark lead to a @xmath20-odd non - zero spin correlation of the plane of the lepton - quark scattering plane with the polarization of the target proton  @xcite . this leading - twist bjorken - scaling  sivers effect \" is nonuniversal since qcd predicts an opposite - sign correlation  @xcite in drell - yan reactions due to the initial - state interactions of the annihilating antiquark .",
    "the @xmath88 and @xmath86-wave proton wavefunctions also appear in the calculation of the pauli form factor quark - by - quark .",
    "thus one can correlate the sivers asymmetry for each struck quark with the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton carried by that quark  @xcite , leading to the prediction that the sivers effect is larger for positive pions .",
    "the physics of the lensing dynamics involves nonperturbative quark - quark interactions at small momentum transfer , not the hard scale @xmath89 of the virtuality of the photon .",
    "it would interesting to see if the strength of the soft initial- or final- state scattering can be predicted using the confining potential of ads / qcd .",
    "it is important to distinguish two very different concepts of the vacuum in quantum field theories such as qed and qcd .",
    "the vacuum is normally defined as the lowest energy eigenstate of the instant - form hamiltonian  the vacuum defined by quantizing at fixed time @xmath41 . in qed , the instant - time vacuum",
    "is saturated with quantum loops of leptons and photons . in calculations of physical processes",
    "one must normal - order the vacuum and divide the @xmath85-matrix elements by the disconnected vacuum loops .",
    "in contrast , the front - form ( light - front ) vacuum is defined as the lowest mass eigenstate of light - front hamiltonian defined by quantizing at fixed @xmath90 .",
    "the vacuum is remarkably simple in light - front quantization because of the restriction @xmath91 for example qed vacuum graphs such as @xmath92 do not arise .",
    "the lf vacuum thus coincides with the vacuum of the free lf hamiltonian . the front - form vacuum and its eigenstates",
    "are lorentz invariant ; whereas the instant form vacuum depends on the observer s lorentz frame .",
    "the instant - form vacuum is a state defined at the same time @xmath41 at all spatial points in the universe . in contrast , the front - from vacuum only senses phenomena which are causally connected ; i.e. , or within the observer s light - cone . causality in quantum field theory",
    "follows the fact that commutators vanish outside the light - cone .",
    "in fact in the lf analysis the spatial support of qcd condensates is restricted to the interior of hadrons , physics which arises due to the interactions of confined quarks and gluons .",
    "the condensate physics is replaced by the dynamics of higher non - valence fock states as shown by casher and susskind .",
    "@xcite in particular , chiral symmetry is broken in a limited domain of size @xmath93 , in analogy to the limited physical extent of superconductor phases .",
    "this novel description of chiral symmetry breaking in terms of  in - hadron condensates \" has also been observed in bethe - salpeter studies  @xcite .",
    "the usual argument for a quark vacuum condensate is the gell - mann  oakes  renner formula : @xmath94 however , in the bethe - salpeter and light - front formalisms , where the pion is a @xmath18 bound - state , the gmor relation is replaced by @xmath95 where @xmath96 represents a pion decay constant via an an elementary pseudoscalar current .",
    "the cosmological constant measures the matrix element of the energy momentum tensor @xmath97 in the background universe .",
    "it corresponds to the measurement of the gravitational interactions of a probe of finite mass ; it only senses the causally connected domain within the light - cone of the observer .",
    "if the universe is empty , the appropriate vacuum state is thus the lf vacuum since it is causal .",
    "one automatically obtains a vanishing cosmological constant from the lf vacuum .",
    "thus , as argued in refs .",
    "@xcite the 45 orders of magnitude conflict of qcd with the observed value of the cosmological condensate is removed , and a new perspective on the nature of quark and gluon condensates in qcd is thus obtained .",

    "<S> atomic physics and hadron physics are both based on yang mills gauge theory ; in fact , quantum electrodynamics can be regarded as the zero - color limit of quantum chromodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> i review a number of areas where the techniques of atomic physics provide important insight into the theory of hadrons in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the dirac - coulomb equation , which predicts the spectroscopy and structure of hydrogenic atoms , has an analog in hadron physics in the form of light - front relativistic equations of motion which give a remarkable first approximation to the spectroscopy , dynamics , and structure of light hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization scale for the running coupling , which is unambiguously set in qed , leads to a method for setting the renormalization scale in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the production of atoms in flight provides a method for computing the formation of hadrons at the amplitude level . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , many techniques which have been developed for hadron physics , such as scaling laws , evolution equations , and light - front quantization have equal utility for atomic physics , especially in the relativistic domain </S>",
    "<S> . i also present a new perspective for understanding the contributions to the cosmological constant from qed and qcd .    ` </S>",
