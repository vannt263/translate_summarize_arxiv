    "black holes in our universe are commonly considered to be formed by the collapse of massive stars in the final stage of their lives . since one would expect the gravitational collapse to settle down to equilibrium states at late times , stationary black holes",
    "are thus of great physical interest and intensively studied in the literature .",
    "one major achievement of the study of stationary black holes is the uniqueness theorem : the only stationary vacuum black hole in an asymptotically flat spacetime is the kerr black hole , and it is completely specified by its mass and angular momentum ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . toward the proof of the uniqueness theorem of black holes , the `` rigidity theorem '' @xcite plays an essential role .",
    "this theorem insists that a rotating black hole must be axisymmetric : the stationary black - hole event horizon is the killing horizon .",
    "killing horizons exhibit thermodynamical properties @xcite , which strongly suggest the intimate association between classical general relativity , quantum theory and statistical mechanics .    however , black holes in our universe rarely reach equilibrium . they evolve by absorbing stars and galactic remnants , or by coalescing . in these fully dynamic processes , one can not identify the location of the event horizon at each time , because it is determined by the global structure of spacetime . over the past decades ,",

    "in contrast to the event horizon , neither of the above requires the knowledge of the entire future .",
    "related works have revealed that these horizons also exhibit laws of black - hole dynamics analogous to those of the killing horizon , irrespective of the highly dynamical settings .",

    "( see  @xcite for the charged case . )",
    "the event horizon in this vacuum spacetime is the simplest example of the trapping horizon discussed below .",
    "the event horizon @xmath71 of a black hole is determined by the global structure of a spacetime as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 denote a causal past and a future null infinity , respectively .",
    "namely , one has to know the entire future of a spacetime to identify black - hole regions .",
    "however , it is rare to solve exactly the field equations due to its non - linearity , and therefore event horizons are of little use in identifying a black hole from a practical viewpoint . to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "one may use a quasi - local notion of horizons , which is more easily handled than the event horizon .",
    "the notion of trapping horizons was originally introduced by hayward  @xcite . to begin with ,",
    "we recapitulate the definitions .",
    "we defer to @xcite for the comparison with dynamical horizons .",
    "[ def : t - surface ] a _ trapped ( untrapped ) surface _ is a compact spatial @xmath1-surface with @xmath75 .",
    "[ def : t - region ] a _ trapped ( untrapped ) region _ is the union of all trapped ( untrapped ) surfaces .",
    "[ def : m - sphere ] a _ marginal surface _ is an @xmath1-surface with @xmath76 .    without loss of generality , we set @xmath77 to be zero on a marginal surface .",
    "we also fix the orientation of the untrapped region such that @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the hereafter .",
    "this means that @xmath41 and @xmath40 are pointing outward and inward , respectively .",
    "[ def:4-msphere ] a marginal surface is _ future _ if @xmath79 , _ past _ if @xmath80 , _ bifurcating _ if @xmath81 , _ outer _ if @xmath82 , _ inner _ if @xmath83 and _ degenerate _ if @xmath84 .",
    "[ def : t - horizon ] a _ trapping horizon _ is the closure of a hypersurface foliated by future or past , outer or inner marginal surfaces .    by definition ,",
    "the notion of trapping horizons does not make any reference to the infinite future , nor the asymptotic structure .",
    "in contrast to event horizons , trapping horizons are meaningful even in the spatially compact spacetime .    among all classes , the _ future outer _ trapping horizon is the most relevant in the context of black holes  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the definition expresses the idea that the ingoing null rays should be converging , @xmath79 , and the outgoing null rays should be instantaneously parallel on the horizon , @xmath85 , diverging just outside the horizon and converging just inside , @xmath82 .    since trapping horizons and event horizons are conceptually different , one may suspect that there is no immediate relationship between them .",
    "however , as is well known , a trapped region certainly arises in the process of a black - hole formation from the gravitational collapse of a massive body .",
    "now by the same arguments of proposition 9.2.1 of @xcite , under the null convergence condition together with the weak cosmic censorship , we conclude @xmath86 on @xmath71 , i.e. , trapped regions can not be seen from the future null infinity .",
    "it then follows in general relativity that the trapping horizon coincides with or resides inside the event horizon under the null energy condition .",
    "thus , they are mutually associated in physically reasonable circumstances",
    ".    the nature of trapping horizons in general relativity has been well appreciated together with energy conditions , which directly imply the null convergence condition .",
    "but in other theories of gravity , the relation between the convergence and energy conditions is not immediate via the field equations .",
    "for this reason , it is not apparent _ a priori _ that trapping horizons in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity have the same properties as those in general relativity . to elucidate",
    "this is the main goal of this section .",
    "because the concept of a trapping horizon is quasi - local , a quasi - local mass is adopted to evaluate the mass of a black hole .",
    "the dynamical nature of a black hole was studied in @xcite in the four - dimensional spherically symmetric case in general relativity without @xmath9 , in which case a trapping horizon is succinctly described by the misner - sharp mass . before moving on to the details ,",
    "we review some of the basic properties of our quasi - local mass ( [ qlm ] )",
    ". see @xcite for the proof .",
    "[ th : asymptotics ] ( _ asymptotic behavior_. ) in the asymptotically flat spacetime , @xmath50 reduces to the higher - dimensional arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass @xcite at spatial infinity .",

    "[ th : positivity ] ( _ positivity_. ) if the dominant energy condition holds on an untrapped spacelike hypersurface with a regular center , then @xmath87 holds there , where the regular center denotes a central point @xmath27 with @xmath88 in that neighborhood .",
    "these properties support the well - posedness of the quasi - local mass .",
    "the asymptotic value correctly denotes the total energy , while monotonicity means that the mass contained within a spatial surface is non - decreasing outwardly .",
    "positivity is not immediately manifest because of the negative contribution of gravitational potential .",
    "it should be stressed that since a regular center is always trapped for @xmath89 , we can not conclude the positivity of @xmath50 in this case , while the case where @xmath90 guarantees proposition [ th : positivity ] . in the case",
    "where @xmath91 , the assumption in the proposition constraints on the metric form around the regular center .",

    "here we have implicitly assumed that the branch points are regular , so that trapping horizons can appear at the minimal ( maximal ) areal radius @xmath105 in the gr - branch ( non - gr - branch ) solutions for @xmath89 .",

    "inasmuch as some equations become trivial at these points , propositions in the next subsections can not be established .",
    "the exclusion of this special case is rather technical than physically unrealizable since our approach fails under the above special situation .",

    "in this paper , we investigated several aspects of dynamical black holes in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity . properties of trapping horizons were elucidated for their types and branches .",
    "let us summarize the upshots briefly .",
    "we supposed that the spacetime has symmetries corresponding to the isometries of an @xmath1-dimensional constant curvature space .",
    "we also assumed the gauss - bonnet coupling @xmath61 to be in the range @xmath17 and @xmath112 , the first is motivated by string theory and the second is to avoid ghosts .",
    "the quasi - local mass of a trapping horizon was shown to obey an inequality summarized in tables  [ table : massgr][table : mass - s ] . in the gr branch with @xmath90 and @xmath113 ,",
    "in particular , the quasi - local mass on an untrapped hypersurface with a marginal surface as an inner boundary has a positive lower bound under the dominant energy condition , corresponding to the value of the mass on the marginal surface .",
    "this isoperimetric inequality is similar to the penrose inequality and establishes the positive mass theorem of a black hole in the case where @xmath90 and @xmath113 .    trapping horizons in the gr branch",
    "were shown to inherit characteristic properties of those in general relativity .",
    "if the dominant energy condition and @xmath114 holds , the topology of outer trapping horizons must have a non - negative curvature .",
    "a future outer trapping horizon is non - timelike under the null energy condition , embodying the idea that a black - hole horizon is a one - way membrane .",
    "then , the area and entropy laws indicate that a black hole grows and mimics the second law of thermodynamics , respectively .    in contrast , in the non - gr branch , trapping horizons have some features which may run counter to our intuition .",
    "the non - spacelike character of a future outer trapping horizon does not display characteristics of a black hole as a region of no escape . besides that , the area of a future outer trapping horizon is non - increasing into the future under the null energy condition , which does not follow our intuition , either .    to see this more concretely ,",
    "let us consider the hawking evaporation of a black hole , in which the null energy condition is violated .",
    "a black hole in the gr branch continues to lose its mass and reduce its area . in other words ,",
    "the signature of a trapping horizon becomes non - spacelike and shrinks .",
    "whereas in the non - gr branch , a black hole defined by a future outer trapping horizon increases its size as it `` evaporates . ''",
    "a fundamental cause of this arises from the sign flip in eq .",
    "( [ rvv ] ) for a radial null vector @xmath115 , which makes the non - gr - branch solutions quite eccentric .",
    "but we have not explicitly shown whether this sign change is special to radial null vectors or an artifact of our spacetime ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) .",
    "we also investigated black - hole dynamics . in four - dimensional general relativity , trapping horizons exhibit laws analogous to black - hole thermodynamics . since their derivation made full use of the einstein equations , it is nontrivial in other theories .",
    "but as shown in @xcite , the unified first law strongly suggests the first law of a trapping horizon in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity . taking the kodama vector as an analog of the null generator of a killing horizon",
    ", we defined the surface gravity of a trapping horizon by following in the footsteps of a killing horizon .",
    "the first law of a trapping horizon states that the energy inflow across the trapping horizon is compensated for by the entropy gain .",
    "the resultant dynamical black - hole entropy does not coincide with one quarter of its area ( in @xmath116 units ) , again reproducing iyer - wald s result .",
    "the disagreement with the general relativistic case causes some annoying but interesting issues . for the @xmath89 case ,",
    "for example , the entropy can be negative .",
    "more interestingly , the entropy of a future outer trapping horizon in the non - gr branch is non - decreasing while its area is non - increasing .",
    "this is preferable in view of the second law of black - hole thermodynamics .",
    "but the question remains open whether the generalized second law holds in this system .",
    "it should also be observed that the null trapping horizon represent equilibrium configurations . under the null energy condition ,",
    "its area and entropy are invariant in time , and moreover energy inflow through the horizon is absent as we have shown below eq .",
    "( [ expansionderiv ] ) .",
    "we excluded from our consideration the trapping horizons coincident with the branch points .",
    "these trapping horizons occur for @xmath89 , and the areal radius takes its minimal ( maximal ) value @xmath105 in the gr ( non - gr ) branch . since the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ tvv ] ) becomes identically zero , the following propositions could not be established .",
    "we may truncate these exceptional trapping horizons from our analysis if the null energy conditions are strictly satisfied , because eq . ( [ rvv ] ) shows that these trapping horizons are singular .",
    "but in other circumstances , we have no definite answer .",
    "the only fact we have at present is that , from eq .",
    "( [ d - entropy ] ) , the entropy remains constant along the generator of these trapping horizons , owing to the vanishing of @xmath117 at that point [ see eq .",
    "( [ derivk2 ] ) ] .",
    "but we have not understood so far how much generality and physical significance these trapping horizons have .",
    "we conclude this paper by commenting on the generalization of the present work .",
    "when we do not assume the present spacetime symmetries ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) , a more general definition of quasi - local mass is required .",
    "a naive prescription is to generalize the hawking mass @xcite , which should satisfy monotonicity and positivity , and represent the higher - dimensional adm mass at spatial infinity in the asymptotically flat case . and",
    "moreover , this generalization should satisfy the energy balance law as eq .",
    "( [ 1stlaw1 ] ) .",
    "we envisage that the extra work terms due to the gravitational radiation should be accompanied in eq .",

    "<S> depending on the existence or absence of the general relativistic limit , solutions are classified into gr and non - gr branches , respectively . assuming the null energy condition on matter fields , we show that a future outer trapping horizon in the gr branch possesses the same properties as that in general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , that in the non - gr branch is shown to be non - spacelike with its area non - increasing into the future . we can recognize this peculiar behavior to arise from a fact that the null energy condition necessarily leads to the null convergence condition for radial null vectors in the gr branch , but not in the non - gr branch . </S>",
