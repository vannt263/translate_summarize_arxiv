    "magnetic nanostructures are subjects of growing interest on account of their potential applications in the fields of high density magnetic recording media and spin electronics . indeed , using magnetic clusters ( containing from a few hundreds to a few thousand atoms ) as memory bits",
    "should highly increase the storage density .",
    "however , clusters with a large magnetic anisotropy have to be used in this case to overcome the superparamagnetic limit@xcite .",
    "cobalt clusters embedded in a platinum matrix could be good candidates because co / pt multilayers display very large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( pma ) @xcite . despite the nearly spherical shape of clusters",
    ", a large remaining interface magnetic anisotropy is expected .",
    "therefore , this system would allow to increase the particle blocking temperature up to temperatures compatible with magnetic recording applications .",

    "though cobalt clusters have similar structures in co / pt and co / nb systems ( a pure cobalt core and an alloyed interface ) , we observe that their magnetic properties are drastically different . in the present paper ,",
    "we first report a detailed magnetic study of the co / pt system showing an anomalous dependence of the cluster magnetization with temperature and a large interface anisotropy .",

    "we can prepare nanostructured thin films by random stacking of incident free clusters on different substrates or films of cobalt clusters embedded in various matrices ( here pt and nb ) thanks to the co - deposition technique .",
    "this last one consists in two independent beams reaching at the same time a silicon ( 100 ) substrate tilted at 45@xmath1 at room temperature : the preformed neutral cluster beam and the atomic beam used for the matrix .",

    "nearly spherical clusters with a fcc structure and a rather sharp size distribution ( mean diameter @xmath5 nm , dispersion @xmath6 ) are observed .",
    "actually , in order to minimize their surface energy , clusters mainly have a truncated octahedron shape@xcite . a 20 nm - thick film of randomly stacked cobalt clusters on a silicon substrate is prepared to perform grazing incidence small angle x - ray diffraction ( gisaxd ) measurements at lure ( laboratoire pour lutilisation du rayonnement electromagntique , orsay - france ) .",

    "1 ) . note that we previously obtained the same result for cobalt clusters embedded in a sio@xmath11 matrix@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in the particular case of co / pt , the x - ray contrast between co and pt is so large that we can not observe the cobalt signal . as a consequence",
    ", we will assume that cobalt clusters keep their fcc structure in co / pt as in co / nb .",
    "furthermore , previous x - ray absorption measurements ( extended x - ray absorption fine structure : exafs ) were performed at lure on co / pt@xcite ( resp .",

    "2 , we clearly show that the saturation moment is temperature dependent .",
    "thus the magnetization also depends on the temperature and its evolution vs. t is shown in fig .",

    "in order to compare our surface anisotropy with previous works , we can estimate the corresponding anisotropy energy per cobalt atom at the cluster surface .",

    "indeed , for a perfect truncated octahedron as the one given in fig .",
    "9(a ) and 9(b ) , symmetries cancel surface anisotropy and we add one ( 111 ) facet to break this symmetry .",

    "summing over all the cluster surface atoms , one finds the anisotropy energy in the whole particle : @xmath118 where @xmath20 is the angle between the magnetization and the [ 111 ] direction .",
    "dividing by the cluster surface , we can deduce @xmath117 from the experimental anisotropy : @xmath119 .",
    "this is one order of magnitude larger than the experimental values given in ref . 2 , 26 , 27 ranging between 0.1 and 0.3 mev / at for 1 - 2 cobalt monolayers in co / pt multilayers",

    ", we believe that interface anisotropy is so small that it becomes possible to fit the magnetization curves using a volume anisotropy . but recent works performed on single cobalt clusters@xcite embedded in a niobium matrix show that interface still rules magnetic anisotropy in this system .",
    "+ other experimental issues to increase magnetic anisotropy in nanosized particles and consequently the corresponding blocking temperature could be tested in the near future : using another matrix element to increase spin - orbit coupling at the cluster surface , preparing slightly elongated particles since interface anisotropy is proportional to the deformation ...",
    "the authors would like to thank professor c. binns from the department of physics and astronomy - university of leceister - uk , for his help during the xmcd measurements on the id12b line at the esrf .",
    "this assertion is justified in the next sections .",
    "a biaxial magnetic anisotropy should be a more general case .",
