    "m31 is an ideal galaxy to study a globular cluster system in a spiral galaxy .",
    "there have been several surveys of globular clusters ( gcs ) in a large region of m31 , but they were all based on photographic plates . there were a few surveys of globular clusters based on ccd observations as well , but they were limited to small areas ( see battistini et al .",
    "1993 , mochejska et al .",
    "1998 , barmby et al . 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "there are currently @xmath2 proposed gc candidates in m31 in the literature . over 200 of these objects",
    "have been confirmed as gcs , 200 have been shown not to be clusters , and the nature of the remaining objects is as yet unknown ( barmby et al . 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , over the past few years , we have undertaken a wide field ccd survey of the globular clusters in m31 .",
    "using the kpno 0.9 m and the tek 2k ccd imager , we have obtained washington @xmath1 images of 53 ( @xmath3 ) fields covering a region @xmath4 deg@xmath5 centered on m31 to search for new gc candidates .",
    "figure 1 illustrates a finding chart of m31 showing our survey region . then using the wiyn 3.5 m and hydra ( multi - fiber spectrograph ) we have obtained spectra covering 38007000 of about 500 gc candidates . we have obtained",
    "the photometry of the point sources and the extended sources in the images using doaphot ii / allframe , and have reduced the hydra spectra using the iraf / dohydra .",
    "we have selected globular cluster candidates using several criteria : a ) color - magnitude diagrams , b ) color - color diagrams , c ) morphological classifiers based on the radial moments and the difference between the aperture magnitude and the point spread function fitting magnitude , and d ) visual inspection of the images .",
    "our recovery rate of the known bonafide gcs is estimated to be @xmath6 .",
    "finally we have used the spectra for confirming the gc candidates ( see seguel et al .",
    "2001 as well ) .",
    "our new photometric survey has produced a total of @xmath7 new gc candidates with @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) mag .",
    "about 600 among these candidates are classified as class 1 ( probable gc candidates ) and class 2 ( possible gc candidates ) , approximately doubling the number of good gc candidates .",
    "figure 2 shows a color - magnitude diagram of sample new gc candidates as well as the known gcs , background galaxies and stars in one selected field ( see kim et al .",
    "2001 for details ) .",
    "note how successfully the known gcs are recovered and how many more new gc candidates ( especially faint ones ) are found in our new survey .",
    "figure 3 displays @xmath10 luminosity function and @xmath11 color distribution of the new gc candidates .",
    "luminosity function continues to increase with increasing magnitude , passing the expected turnover at @xmath12 mag .",
    "this shows that the faint end in the luminosity function ( @xmath13 mag ) contains many non - globular cluster objects .",
    "color distribution of the gc candidates with @xmath14 mag shows a hint of bimodality , but needs a further study to confirm it .",
    "finally aperture photometry of the gc candidates will be used for further analysis .",
    "however , these new gc candidates discovered as part of our photometric survey need to be confirmed by spectroscopy .",
    "as for the current spectroscopic data of the m31 gcs , barmby et al .",
    "( 2000 ) contains so far the most comprehensive catalog , which still only contains 200 velocity measurements and 188 spectroscopic metallicities of the gc candidates previously known .",
    "spectroscopic data are being analyzed now .",
    "figure 4 displays sample spectra of new gcs with @xmath15 mag spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "several features typical for globular clusters ( ca ii h and k , h@xmath16 , g band , mgb complex , fe 5270 , na d , and h@xmath17 lines ) are clearly noticed in the spectra .",
    "it is pleasing to find not only new gcs as faint as 19.0 mag but also new gcs as bright as 14.9 mag in our survey .",
    "we are planning to confirm spectroscopically most of the new gc candidates in m31 .",
    "when our survey is finished , a new m31 gc catalog will be made , combining the new gcs and the known gcs .",
    "the final catalog of m31 globular clusters will be used : 1 ) to derive a reliable gc luminosity function for m31 , the faint end of which was very incomplete in the previous data ; 2 ) to investigate the bimodality of the metallicity distribution , which was seen only in the spectroscopic data of the previous catalog , but not clearly in any photometric data ( barmby et al . 2000 ) ; 3 ) to investigate the difference in mean luminosity between the metal - poor gcs and the metal - rich gcs .",
    "the present catalog of m31 globular clusters shows that the metal - poor gcs are 0.4 mag fainter than the metal - rich gcs ( barmby et al .",
    "2000 , barmby 2001 ) , which is the opposite to the case of the gcs in early - type galaxies and our galaxy ( larsen et al .",
    "our new catalog will be helpful to resolve this discrepancy ; and 4 ) to investigate the systematic difference in kinematics between the metal - poor and the metal - rich gcs , which provides critical information on the age difference between the two populations and strong constraints on galaxy formation scenarios .",
