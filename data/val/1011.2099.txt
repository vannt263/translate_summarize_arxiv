    "mass outflows from active galactic nucleus sources ( agns ) are believed to affect their surrounding galaxy and the intergalactic environment in many ways .",
    "the powerful winds from agn may play an active role in shaping the host galaxy evolution by blowing out the necessary fuel for star formation , effectively quenching it .",
    "further , the ejected gas enriches the galaxy s local environment as well as the intergalactic medium with metals produced from supernovae .",
    "while it is believed that outflows are ubiquitous in agn , signatures of these winds are only seen in @xmath1 5060% of seyfert ( sy)11.5 sources in the x - ray and uv bands @xcite .",
    "this fraction is of fundamental importance , since it represents the solid angle occupied by the outflow .",
    "the previous outflow studies are not complete  selecting bright sources in the optical / soft x - ray bands .",
    "therefore , they may be biased towards selecting warm absorbers . to determine the true fraction of agn with outflows / warm absorbers , it is necessary to search for absorption signatures in an unbiased sample . in this letter",
    ", we detail our study identifying outflows in the sources selected in the very hard x - ray band with swift s burst alert telescope ( bat ) . due to the selection in the 14195kev band",
    ", the swift sample is unbiased towards all but the heaviest line - of - sight absorption ( @xmath2atoms@xmath3 ) for sources with a bat flux of @xmath4ergss@xmath5@xmath3 .",
    "the sample of 153 agns in the swift bat nine - month catalog @xcite are the most well - studied and brightest hard x - ray sources .",
    "details of their 0.310kev x - ray spectra @xcite , optical spectra @xcite , and infrared spectra from spitzer @xcite are well documented in the literature .",
    "additionally , many of these sources are well - known agns with high signal - to - noise archived data available from current x - ray observatories ( i.e. ,  suzaku , xmm - newton , chandra ) .",
    "we selected all of the optically classified seyfert 11.5 sources in the nine - month bat catalog with a high galactic latitude ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this sample includes 51 sources , of which 44 have archived spectra available . the typically low intrinsic column densities ( n@xmath7@xmath3 ) of seyfert",
    "1s make them the best sources for searching for outflow signatures .",
    "this is due to the fact that x - ray outflow signatures are found primarily in the soft band , where more absorbed sources have lower observed luminosities .",
    "in the x - ray band , outflows are detected primarily in the soft 0.32kev band through emission and/or absorption features from oxygen ( e.g. ,  0.65 kev ly@xmath8 , 0.77 kev ly@xmath9 ) , magnesium ( e.g. ,  1.35kev ) , neon ( e.g. ,  1.02kev ly@xmath8 ) , and iron ( e.g. ,  0.87 kev , 0.92 kev , 0.96 kev ) .",
    "however , detection of these lines typically requires high signal - to - noise observations with the grating spectrometers on xmm - newton or chandra . to obtain high signal - to - noise grating spectra ,",
    "long exposures are required of the order of @xmath10ks for the swift sources .",
    "therefore , it is more feasible to detect x - ray outflows in a larger sample of sources through ccd data . in the ccd data , absorption edges from ( 0.73kev ) and ( 0.87kev )",
    "indicate the presence of outflows .",
    "high signal - to - noise archived x - ray ccd data from suzaku and xmm - newton are available for many of our sources . while the and edges are detectable in data of moderate quality ( i.e. , @xmath11ks with xmm - newton for the swift sources as in @xcite ) , we chose to use predominantly higher exposure time observations of @xmath12ks ( though , exposure times range from 2275ks with 34/44 having exposure times @xmath13ks ) .",
    "the suzaku x - ray observatory was our first choice for x - ray observations since simultaneous data is available from the 0.312kev ( with the xis detectors ) and @xmath1450kev band ( with the hxd pin detector ) .",
    "this allows us to better constrain the underlying continuum and provides overlapping energy coverage between the suzaku spectra and the 22-month averaged 14195kev swift bat spectra @xcite . properly constraining the continuum emission is essential in order to accurately determine limits on the optical depth of and absorption edges .",
    "suzaku data were available for 27/51 sources . where multiple suzaku observations exist",
    ", we analyzed the longest observation .    for sources without a suzaku follow - up",
    ", we analyzed archived xmm - newton epic observations .",
    "an additional 17 sources have high signal - to - noise xmm - newton observations without a suzaku follow - up . in total",
    ", we analyzed the spectra of 44/51 ( 80% ) of the seyfert 11.5 sources in the swift bat nine - month catalog .",
    "the sources which do not have available high quality observations represent lower luminosity sources which were identified as agn for the first time by swift .",
    "full details of the observations and data are presented in winter _",
    "( in prep ) . to summarize the processing of the observations , for the suzaku xis ( xis0 , xis1 , xis3 , and xis2 , where available  in the 0.312kev band ) and xmm - newton epic pn ( in the 0.310kev band ) data we extracted the spectra from circular regions centered on the source of @xmath15200 .",
    "background regions were extracted in regions near the source but free of additional sources .",
    "the suzaku spectra were extracted using the ftool xselect , while the pn spectra were extracted with sas using the standard filtering for the pn as detailed in the sas abc guide .",
    "response and ancillary response matrices were generated using the suzaku ftools xisrmfgen and xisarfgen or sas commands rmfgen and arfgen .",
    "the spectra were then grouped and binned to 20countsperbin using grppha .",
    "the suzaku hxd pin ( @xmath1450kev ; @xcite ) spectra were extracted using xselect from the processed cleaned event files .",
    "the tuned pin background file specific to each observation was used to extract a background spectrum .",
    "the spectra were corrected for dead time and the cxb contribution was added to the background spectrum as specified in the suzaku abc guide .",
    "the corresponding response file from the suzaku caldb was used for each observation .",
    "the pin spectra and responses were grouped using grppha and binned to a signal - to - noise of 34@xmath16 .",
    "finally , we also utilized the swift bat 22-month averaged spectra and diagonal response file from @xcite .",
    "these spectra consist of 8 energy channels in the bat band of 14195kev .",
    "we simultaneously fit the suzaku xis and pin or xmm - newton pn spectra with the swift bat spectra to obtain joint fits in the 0.3195kev band .",
    "we used the xspec @xcite spectral fitting package v12 .",
    "for the sources with suzaku spectra , we added a constant model to allow for differences in the flux scaling between the spectra , normalizing to the xis1 spectrum .",
    "the pin spectrum was fixed to the value of 1.16 , as detailed in the suzaku abc guide , while the constant factor was allowed to vary for the bat spectrum and the additional xis spectra . for sources with xmm - newton spectra",
    ", we allowed the constant factor to vary relative to the pn level .    for all of the sources",
    ", we fit the broad - band x - ray spectra with a base cutoff power law model .",
    "seyfert direct emission is assumed to be produced from inverse compton scattering in the corona surrounding an accretion disk  which is well represented by a power law with a cutoff at high energy .",
    "we included neutral absorption from the galaxy with a tbabs model , fixing the galactic column density to the @xcite value . where the addition of intrinsic neutral absorption improves the fit ( @xmath17 on adding the model , corresponding to @xmath18 for the addition of one degree of freedom ) , we added intrinsic emission with a ztbabs model .",
    "where a soft excess was evident , we included a blackbody model to account for the soft excess . to better constrain the continuum emission",
    ", we added a gaussian model ( zgauss ) to account for neutral fe k@xmath8 emission and a pexrav model to account for reflected emission from the accretion disk .",
    "full details of the modeling , including the best - fit parameters ( in particular , l@xmath19 and n@xmath20 ) , are in winter et al .",
    "( in prep ) .    with a baseline model for the continuum , we searched the spectra for signatures of outflows through the presence of and edges .",
    "we used two zedge models , one to account for each of the two absorption edges .",
    "the zedge model has three parameters , the energy of the edge , redshift , and optical depth .",
    "we initially allowed the edge energy and optical depth to vary around the laboratory measured values of the edges ( 0.73 and 0.87kev , respectively ) , fixing the redshift to the source redshift . where the energies were not well - constrained ( i.e. , the fitted energies were not consistent with the absorption edge energies ) , we fixed the energies to the laboratory value . in table",
    "[ tbl - warmabs ] , we record the results of this analysis , including the @xmath21 upon adding the absorption edges to the baseline model , energies , and optical depths for the fitted edges .",
    "we classify the source as exhibiting an outflow where an improvement in @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath23 ( a probability of @xmath18 for four additional degrees of freedom ) . additionally , we include ngc 3516 , whose spectrum was not well - fit by our base model , but clearly has an outflow present ( see @xcite for a complete analysis of the absorption in the suzaku observation of ngc 3516 ) .",
    "we classify 41% ( 18/44 ) of swift bat sy 11.5 sources as exhibiting the outflow signatures probed through detection of and edges . of the outflow sources ,",
    "half are sy 11.2s and half are sy 1.5s .",

    "we find the range of optical depths for is @xmath26 and for is @xmath27 . in this section",
    ", we describe the properties of the outflow versus non - outflow sources .    in figure  1 , we plot the optical depth of and versus the swift bat luminosity ( 14195kev ) for the outflow ( circle ) and non - outflow ( triangle ) sources in our sample . throughout this section ,",
    "we use the swift bat luminosity because it is measured at high energies and is thus less affected by obscuration . clearly , the outflow sources have the highest measurements for optical depth , on average . additionally , we find that the measured optical depth in both and is low for the highest luminosity ( @xmath28ergss@xmath5 ) sources overall .",
    "we plot the sy 11.2 sources with open and the sy 1.5 sources with filled symbols .",
    "another trend which we find is that the highest luminosity sources tend to be sy 11.2 sources .",
    "only one source out of eleven with @xmath29ergss@xmath5 is a sy 1.5 .",
    "finally , the four sources with the strongest outflows ( ngc 3516 , ngc 4151 , mrk 6 , and ngc 526a ) have intermediate luminosities and are all sy 1.5s .    additionally in figure  1 , we plot the relationship between optical depth and accretion rate for our sample . as an estimate of accretion rate , we use l@xmath30/l@xmath31 , where l@xmath32ergss@xmath5 . the black hole mass estimates are from stellar bulge k - band photometry in @xcite , which were shown to be well - correlated with reverberation mapping based mass estimates ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is no correlation between accretion rate and optical depth .",
    "however , the sources with the strongest outflows have intermediate values of accretion rates and luminosities .",
    "the highest accretion rate sources are sy 11.2 sources .",
    "table  [ tbl - compare ] includes average , standard deviation , and the results of kolmogrov - smirnov ( k - s ) statistical tests for measured parameters of our outflow and non - outflow samples . comparing the average values of both luminosity and accretion rate , we find that the sources with outflows have lower luminosities and accretion rates than the sources without outflows . also , we find that the non - outflow sources have more massive black holes .",
    "there is also a difference between the outflow and non - outflow sources in the measured neutral hydrogen column density . assuming n@xmath33@xmath3 for sources with no significant @xmath34 measured , we find that sources with detected outflows have larger neutral column densities",
    ".    results of the k - s tests show that the probability of mass and accretion rates of the outflow and non - outflow sources being drawn from different populations is low .",
    "therefore , the main statistical difference between the outflow and non - outflow sources is the luminosity and secondarily n@xmath20 .    in figure  2",
    ", we plot the fraction of outflows detected in binned n@xmath20 , bat luminosity , black hole mass , and accretion rate .",
    "we find that there are few outflows ( @xmath35% ) detected in sources with low column densities ( n@xmath36@xmath3 ) .",
    "conversely , outflows are detected in @xmath37% of sources with n@xmath38@xmath3 .",
    "outflow detection rates are low at the highest luminosities ( @xmath39% for l@xmath40ergss@xmath5 ) , masses ( @xmath41% for m / m@xmath42 ) , and accretion rates ( @xmath41% for l@xmath30/l@xmath43 ) .",
    "therefore , even though the total distribution of black hole mass and accretion rate between outflow and non - outflow sources is not statistically different , the binned values show fewer outflows at the highest mass / accretion rate . at the lowest masses / accretion rates / luminosities",
    ", we find outflows in @xmath44@xmath45% of the sources  approximately twice the detection rate for the highest mass / accretion rate / luminosity sources .",
    "we have categorized sources in our study as outflow or non - outflow sources using the significance of and absorption edges to a base continuum model ( an absorbed power - law with soft excess and reflection ) .",
    "this ensures that we are selecting the sources with the highest optical depth in and as outflow sources ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "our sample includes 44 sy 11.5 sources detected in the very hard x - rays with the swift bat .",
    "this is the first study of the occurrence of outflows in an unbiased sample of agn .",
    "we find an outflow detection rate of 41% . in a similar study detecting outflows through and edges in asca spectra of 24 type 1 agn , a detection rate of 50%",
    "is found @xcite . of these 24 agn ,",
    "18 are also found in our survey .",
    "we find the same categorization as an outflow / non - outflow source for 14/18 sources .",
    "the remaining four ( ic 4329a , ngc 5548 , 3c 382 , and 3c 390.3 ) are categorized as having outflows in @xcite and non - outflow sources in our study .",
    "the upper limits on the optical depths for ic 4329a and ngc 5548 are within the range of values for sources with detected outflows , though the @xmath21 values are low .",
    "further , chandra x - ray grating observations of these sources show ionized absorption is present .",
    "the residuals to our base model show evidence of potential warm absorber signatures in the spectra of ic 4329a and ngc 5548 , but at lower energies ( @xmath46kev ) than probed with the and edges .",
    "these features are likely associated with absorption in and from @xmath47kev .",
    "grating spectroscopy with xmm - newton of 3c 382 revealed a highly ionized ( @xmath48ergcms@xmath5 ) absorber with a column of @xmath49@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "finally , ionized absorption is detected at higher energies than probed in our study ( 6.6kev ) in xmm - newton observations of 3c 390.3 , indicating an even higher ionization parameter of @xmath50ergcms@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we miss the detection of outflows in these luminous sources because they are more highly ionized .",
    "it is unclear , however , why and edges were detected in the asca data , but not with the suzaku / xmm - newton ccd data .",
    "the main question that our results raise is why there are less outflow detections in the most luminous agn .",
    "the most luminous sources in our sample , those with @xmath51 , are , from most to least luminous , 4c + 74.26 , mr 2251178 , 3c 390.3 , 3c 382 , 1h 0419577 , and mrk 926 .",
    "the four highest luminosity sources are radio - loud and have very broad optical emission line profiles , including double - peaked hydrogen balmer lines .",
    "very highly ionized ( @xmath52 ) gas is detected in each of these sources ( grating spectroscopy reveals highly ionized gas in 4c + 74.26 and mr 2251178 , see @xcite ) .",
    "of the additional luminous sources , xmm - newton grating spectroscopy of 1h 0419577 reveals ionized gas with a low ionization parameter ( @xmath53 ) and multiple observations show that the ionized ( as well as neutral ) absorption is variable @xcite . since high resolution observations of mrk 926",
    "do not exist , it is unclear whether ionized absorbers are present in this source .",
    "however , it is clear that the fraction of ionized absorbers is high even in the highest luminosity sources ( at least 5/6 ) , despite the fact that and absorption edges are only detected in 2/6 of these sources .",
    "similarly , 3/4 sources with @xmath54 have absorbers detected ( two are outflow sources in this paper , ngc 7213 has detected ovii and oviii emission lines in hetg spectra , and ugc 6728 has no high resolution spectra available ) .",
    "the next step in understanding the outflow properties of local seyfert 1s is to identify the more detailed properties of the ionized gas ( i.e. , ionization parameter , column density , velocity ) .",
    "our study of outflow detections from and absorption edges probes only a narrow range of ionization states . as we found for the highest luminosity sources",
    ", we are missing the detection of more or less ionized gas and therefore underestimating the fraction of sources with outflows . based on a literature search of the highest luminosity sources , we find that the fraction of outflows is @xmath55% , while the fraction of sources with and absorption edges is from 3060% ( with low detection rates at high luminosity and high detection rates at low luminosity ) .",
    "this suggests that outflows may be present in all local agns . as future work",
    ", we will extend our outflow study by analyzing archived grating spectroscopy to determine the ionization state , column density , and velocity of the warm absorbers present in the swift bat sample .",

    "<S> previous surveys of outflows in low - redshift active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have relied on the analysis of sources selected primarily for their optical / x - ray brightness , and are therefore biased . towards determining the outflow properties of local agn , we detect warm absorption signatures of and absorption edges in the available suzaku / xmm - newton ccd spectra of an unbiased sample of 44 seyfert 11.5 sources selected in the very hard x - rays ( 14195kev ) with the swift burst alert telescope . from our analysis , we find that and absorption edges are present in 41% of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> this fraction is dependent on luminosity , with outflow detections in 60% of low luminosity and 30% of high luminosity sources . </S>",
    "<S> however , grating spectroscopy of the highest luminosity sources reveals that @xmath0% of these sources have ionized absorbers , but that the ionization states are higher / lower than produces the and edges . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that ionized absorption may be present in all local seyfert 1s . </S>"
