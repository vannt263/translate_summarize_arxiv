    "in recent years important observational advances have led quite convincingly to the astonishing conclusion that the present universe is dominated by an exotic homogeneous energy density with _ negative _ pressure .",
    "i shall discuss the current evidence for this unexpected finding in detail later on , but let me already indicate in this introduction the most relevant astronomical data .",
    "first , we now have quite accurate measurements of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) . in particular",
    ", the position of the first acoustic peak in the angular power spectrum implies that the universe is , on large scales , nearly flat ( sect.6 ) .    on the other hand , a number of observational results , for instance from clusters of galaxies , show consistently that the amount of `` matter '' ( baryons and dark matter ) which clumps in various structures is significantly _",
    "undercritical_. hence , there must exist a _",
    "homogeneously _ distributed exotic energy component .",
    "important additional constraints come from the hubble diagram of type ia supernovas at high redshifts .",
    "although not yet as convincing , they support these conclusions ( sect.5 ) .",
    "more recently , the combination of cmb data and information provided by large scale galaxy redshift surveys have given additional confirmation .",
    "some of you may say that all this just shows that we have to keep the cosmological term in einstein s field equations , a possibility has been considered during all the history of relativistic cosmology ( see sect.2 ) . from our present understanding we would indeed expect a non - vanishing cosmological constant , mainly on the basis of quantum theory , as will be discussed at length later on .",
    "however , if a cosmological term describes the astronomical observations , then we are confronted with two difficult problems , many of us worry about :    the first is the _ old mystery _ : since all sorts of vacuum energies contribute to the effective cosmological constant ( see sect.4 ) , we wonder why the total vacuum energy density is so incredibly small by all particle physics standards .",
    "theoreticians are aware of this profound problem since a long time ,  at least those who think about the role of gravity among the fundamental interactions .",
    "most probably , we will only have a satisfactory answer once we shall have a theory which successfully combines the concepts and laws of general relativity about gravity and spacetime structure with those of quantum theory .",
    "before the new astronomical findings one could at least hope that we may one day have a basic understanding for a vanishing cosmological constant , and there have been interesting attempts in this direction ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "but now we are also facing a _ cosmic coincidence _ problem : since the vacuum energy density is constant in time  at least after the qcd phase transition ",
    ", while the matter energy density decreases as the universe expands , it is more than surprising that the two are comparable just at the present time , while their ratio has been tiny in the early universe and will become very large in the distant future .",
    "this led to the idea that the effective cosmological constant we observe today is actually a _",
    "dynamical _ quantity , varying with time .",
    "i want to emphasize already now that these so - called _ quintessence _ models do , however , not solve the first problem .",
    "( more on this in sect.7 . )",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the instructive early history of the @xmath0term , including some early remarks by pauli on the quantum aspect connected with it . in section 3",
    "we recall important examples of vacuum energies in quantum electrodynamics and their physical significance under variable external conditions .",
    "we then shown in section 4 that simple and less naive order of magnitude estimates of various contributions to the vacuum energy density of the standard model all lead to expectations which are in gigantic conflict with the facts .",
    "i then turn to the astronomical and astrophysical aspects of our theme . in section 5",
    "it will be described what is known about the luminosity - redshift relation for type ia supernovas .",
    "the remaining systematic uncertainties are discussed in some detail .",
    "most space of section 6 is devoted to the physics of the cmb , including of how the system of basic equations which govern its evolution before and after recombination is obtained .",
    "we then summarize the current observational results , and what has been learned from them about the cosmological parameters .",
    "we conclude in section 7 with a few remarks about the goal of quintessence models and the main problems this scenario is facing .",
    "the cosmological term was introduced by einstein when he applied general relativity for the first time to cosmology . in his paper of 1917 @xcite",
    "he found the first cosmological solution of a consistent theory of gravity . in spite of its drawbacks",
    "this bold step can be regarded as the beginning of modern cosmology .",
    "it is still interesting to read this paper about which einstein says : _",
    "`` i shall conduct the reader over the road that i have myself travelled , rather a rough and winding road , because otherwise i can not hope that he will take much interest in the result at the end of the journey . '' _ in a letter to p. ehrenfest on 4 february 1917 einstein wrote about his attempt : _",
    "`` i have again perpetrated something relating to the theory of gravitation that might endanger me of being committed to a madhouse .",
    "( ich habe wieder etwas verbrochen in der gravitationstheorie , was mich ein wenig in gefahr bringt , in ein tollhaus interniert zu werden . ) '' _ @xcite .",
    "in his attempt einstein assumed  and this was completely novel  that space is globally _ closed _ , because he then believed that this was the only way to satisfy mach s principle , in the sense that the metric field should be determined uniquely by the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "in addition , einstein assumed that the universe was _",
    "static_. this was not unreasonable at the time , because the relative velocities of the stars as observed were small .",
    "( recall that astronomers only learned later that spiral nebulae are independent star systems outside the milky way .",
    "this was definitely established when in 1924 hubble found that there were cepheid variables in andromeda and also in other galaxies .",
    "five years later he announced the recession of galaxies . )",
    "these two assumptions were , however , not compatible with einstein s original field equations .",
    "for this reason , einstein added the famous @xmath1-term , which is compatible with the principles of general relativity , in particular with the energy - momentum law @xmath2 for matter .",
    "the modified field equations in standard notation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and signature @xmath3 are @xmath4 for the static einstein universe these equations imply the two relations @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mass density of the dust filled universe ( zero pressure ) and @xmath7 is the radius of curvature .",
    "( we remark , in passing , that the einstein universe is the only static dust solution ; one does not have to assume isotropy or homogeneity .",
    "its instability was demonstrated by lematre in 1927 . )",
    "einstein was very pleased by this direct connection between the mass density and geometry , because he thought that this was in accord with mach s philosophy .",
    "( his enthusiasm for what he called mach s principle later decreased . in a letter to f.pirani he wrote in 1954 : _ `` as a matter of fact , one should no longer speak of mach s principle at all .",
    "( von dem machschen prinzip sollte man eigentlich berhaupt nicht mehr sprechen '' . ) _",
    "@xcite )    in the same year , 1917 , de sitter discovered a completely different static cosmological model which also incorporated the cosmological constant , but was _ anti - machian _ , because it contained no matter @xcite .",
    "the model had one very interesting property : for light sources moving along static world lines there is a gravitational redshift , which became known as the _ de sitter effect_. this was thought to have some bearing on the redshift results obtained by slipher . because the fundamental ( static ) worldlines in this model are not geodesic",
    ", a freely- falling particle released by any static observer will be seen by him to accelerate away , generating also local velocity ( doppler ) redshifts corresponding to _",
    "peculiar velocities_. in the second edition of his book @xcite , published in 1924 , eddington writes about this :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` de sitter s theory gives a double explanation for this motion of recession ; first there is a general tendency to scatter ( ... ) ; second there is a general displacement of spectral lines to the red in distant objects owing to the slowing down of atomic vibrations ( ... ) , which would erroneously be interpreted as a motion of recession .

    "an important discussion of the redshift of galaxies in de sitter s model by h. weyl @xcite in 1923 should , however , be mentioned .",
    "weyl introduced an expanding version of the de sitter model . for",
    "_ small _ distances his result reduced to what later became known as the hubble law .    until about 1930",
    "almost everybody _ knew _ that the universe was static , in spite of the two fundamental papers by friedmann @xcite in 1922 and 1924 and lematre s independent work @xcite in 1927 .",
    "these path breaking papers were in fact largely ignored .",
    "the history of this early period has  as is often the case  been distorted by some widely read documents .",
    "einstein too accepted the idea of an expanding universe only much later .",
    "after the first paper of friedmann , he published a brief note claiming an error in friedmann s work ; when it was pointed out to him that it was his error , einstein published a retraction of his comment , with a sentence that luckily was deleted before publication : _ `` [ friedmann s paper ] while mathematically correct is of no physical significance''_. in comments to lematre during the solvay meeting in 1927 , einstein again rejected the expanding universe solutions as physically unacceptable . according to lematre",

    "* 235 *    presumably , one day some historian of science will try to find out what happened with the young physicist s.b .",
    "preuss , who apparently wrote just one important paper and then disappeared from the scene .",
    "einstein repeated his new standpoint much later @xcite , and this was also adopted by many other influential workers , e.g. , by pauli @xcite . whether einstein really considered the introduction of the @xmath1-term as `` the biggest blunder of his life '' appears doubtful to me . in",
    "his published work and letters i never found such a strong statement .",
    "einstein discarded the cosmological term just for simplicity reasons . for a minority of cosmologists ( o.heckmann , for example @xcite ) , this was not sufficient reason .",
    "after the @xmath1-force was rejected by its inventor , other cosmologists , like eddington , retained it .",
    "one major reason was that it solved the problem of the age of the universe when the hubble time scale was thought to be only 2 billion years ( corresponding to the value @xmath8 of the hubble constant ) .",
    "this was even shorter than the age of the earth .",
    "in addition , eddington and others overestimated the age of stars and stellar systems .",
    "for this reason , the @xmath1-term was employed again and a model was revived which lematre had singled out from the many solutions of the friedmann - lematre equations - term in his basic equations .",
    "i find it remarkable that for the negatively curved solutions he pointed out that these may be open or compact ( but not simply connected ) . ] .",
    "this so - called lematre hesitation universe is closed and has a repulsive @xmath1-force ( @xmath9 ) , which is slightly greater than the value chosen by einstein .",
    "it begins with a big bang and has the following two stages of expansion . in the first the @xmath1-force is not important , the expansion is decelerated due to gravity and slowly approaches the radius of the einstein universe . at about the same time , the repulsion becomes stronger than gravity and a second stage of expansion begins which eventually inflates into a whimper . in this way",
    "a positive @xmath1 was employed to reconcile the expansion of the universe with the age of stars .",
    "the repulsive effect of a positive cosmological constant can be seen from the following consequence of einstein s field equations for the time - dependent scale factor @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the pressure of all forms of matter .",
    "historically , the newtonian analog of the cosmological term was regarded by einstein , weyl , pauli , and others as a _",
    "yukawa term_. this is not correct , as i now show .    for a better understanding of the action of the @xmath1-term it may be helpful to consider a general static spacetime with the metric ( in adapted coordinates ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 depend only on the spatial coordinate @xmath16 .",
    "the component @xmath17 of the ricci tensor is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the three - dimensional laplace operator for the spatial metric @xmath20 in ( 4 ) ( see , e.g . , @xcite ) .",
    "let us write eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the form @xmath21 with @xmath22 this has the form of the energy - momentum tensor of an ideal fluid , with energy density @xmath23 and pressure @xmath24",
    ". for an ideal fluid at rest einstein s field equation implies @xmath25.\\ ] ] since the energy density and the pressure appear in the combination @xmath26 , we understand that a positive @xmath27 leads to a repulsion ( as in ( 3 ) ) . in the newtonian limit we have @xmath28 : newtonian potential ) and @xmath29 ,",
    "hence we obtain the modified poisson equation @xmath30 this is the correct newtonian limit .    as a result of revised values of the hubble parameter and the development of the modern theory of stellar evolution in the 1950s ,",
    "the controversy over ages was resolved and the @xmath1-term became again unnecessary .",
    "( some tension remained for values of the hubble parameter at the higher end of recent determinations . )    however , in 1967 it was revived again in order to explain why quasars appeared to have redshifts that concentrated near the value @xmath31 .",
    "the idea was that quasars were born in the hesitation era @xcite .",
    "then quasars at greatly different distances can have almost the same redshift , because the universe was almost static during that period .",
    "other arguments in favor of this interpretation were based on the following peculiarity .",
    "when the redshifts of emission lines in quasar spectra exceed 1.95 , then redshifts of absorption lines in the same spectra were , as a rule , equal to 1.95 .",
    "this was then quite understandable , because quasar light would most likely have crossed intervening galaxies during the epoch of suspended expansion , which would result in almost identical redshifts of the absorption lines . however , with more observational data evidence for the @xmath1-term dispersed for the third time .",
    "let me conclude this historical review with a few remarks on the _ quantum aspect _ of the @xmath1-problem .",
    "since quantum physicists had so many other problems , it is not astonishing that in the early years they did not worry about this subject .",
    "an exception was pauli , who wondered in the early 1920s whether the zero - point energy of the radiation field could be gravitationally effective .",
    "as background i recall that planck had introduced the zero - point energy with somewhat strange arguments in 1911 .",
    "the physical role of the zero - point energy was much discussed in the days of the old bohr - sommerfeld quantum theory . from charly",
    "enz and armin thellung ",
    "pauli s last two assistants  i have learned that pauli had discussed this issue extensively with o.stern in hamburg .",
    "stern had calculated , but never published , the vapor pressure difference between the isotopes 20 and 22 of neon ( using debye theory ) .",
    "he came to the conclusion that without zero - point energy this difference would be large enough for easy separation of the isotopes , which is not the case in reality .",
    "these considerations penetrated into pauli s lectures on statistical mechanics @xcite ( which i attended ) .",
    "the theme was taken up in an article by enz and thellung @xcite .",
    "this was originally written as a birthday gift for pauli , but because of pauli s early death , appeared in a memorial volume of helv.phys.acta .",
    "> from pauli s discussions with enz and thellung we know that pauli estimated the influence of the zero - point energy of the radiation field ",
    "cut off at the classical electron radius  on the radius of the universe , and came to the conclusion that it `` could not even reach to the moon '' .",
    "when , as a student , i heard about this , i checked pauli s unpublished remark by doing the following little calculation :    in units with @xmath32 the vacuum energy density of the radiation field is @xmath33 with @xmath34 the corresponding radius of the einstein universe in eq.(2 ) would then be ( @xmath35 ) @xmath36 this is indeed less than the distance to the moon .",
    "( it would be more consistent to use the curvature radius of the static de sitter solution ; the result is the same , up to the factor @xmath37 . )    for decades nobody else seems to have worried about contributions of quantum fluctuations to the cosmological constant .",
    "as far as i know , zeldovich was the first who came back to this issue in two papers @xcite during the third renaissance period of the @xmath1-term , but before the advent of spontaneously broken gauge theories .",
    "the following remark by him is particularly interesting . even if one assumes completely ad hoc that the zero - point contributions to the vacuum energy density are exactly cancelled by a bare term ( see eq.(29 ) below ) , there still remain higher - order effects . in particular , _ gravitational _ interactions between the particles in the vacuum fluctuations are expected on dimensional grounds to lead to a gravitational self - energy density of order @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is some cut - off scale . even for @xmath39 as low as 1 gev ( for no good reason ) this is about 9 orders of magnitude larger than the observational bound ( discussed later ) .",
    "_ without gravity _ , we do not care about the absolute energy of the vacuum , because only energy _ differences _ matter .",
    "in particular , differences of vacuum energies are relevant in many instances , whenever a system is studied under varying external conditions .",
    "a beautiful example is the _ casimir effect _ @xcite . in this case",
    "the presence of the conducting plates modifies the vacuum energy density in a manner which depends on the separation of the plates .",
    "this implies an attractive force between the plates .",
    "precision experiments have recently confirmed the theoretical prediction to high accuracy ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "we shall consider other important examples , but begin with a very simple one which illustrates the main point .",
    "recall first how the zero - point energy of the harmonic oscillator can be understood on the basis of the canonical commutation relations @xmath40= i$ ] .",
    "these prevent the _ simultaneous _ vanishing of the two terms in the hamiltonian @xmath41 the lowest energy state results from a compromise between the potential and kinetic energies , which vary oppositely as functions of the width of the wave function .",
    "one understands in this way why the ground state has an absolute energy which is not zero ( _ zero - point - energy _",
    "@xmath42 ) .",
    "next , we consider two identical harmonic oscillators separated by a distance @xmath43 , which are harmonically coupled by the dipole - dipole interaction energy @xmath44 . with a simple canonical transformation we can decouple the two harmonic oscillators and find for the frequencies of the decoupled ones @xmath45 , and thus for the ground state energy @xmath46 the second term on the right depends on r and gives the van der waals force ( which vanishes for @xmath47 ) .",
    "similar phenomena arise for quantized fields .",
    "we consider , as a simple example , the free quantized electromagnetic field @xmath48 .",
    "for this we have for the equal times commutators the following nontrivial one ( jordan and pauli @xcite ) : @xmath49 = i \\bigl(\\delta_{ij } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k } -\\delta_{ik } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j } \\bigr ) \\delta^{(3)}(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$ } -\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x'$})\\ ] ] ( all other equal time commutators vanish ) ; here @xmath50 , and cyclic .",
    "this basic commutation relation prevents the simultaneous vanishing of the electric and magnetic energies .",
    "it follows that the ground state of the quantum field ( the vacuum ) has a non - zero absolute energy , and that the variances of @xmath51 and @xmath52 in this state are nonzero .",
    "this is , of course , a quantum effect .    in the schrdinger picture",

    "since the vacuum state is lorentz invariant , this expectation value is an invariant symmetric tensor , hence proportional to the metric tensor . for a curved metric",
    "this is still the case , up to higher curvature terms : @xmath108 the _ effective _ cosmological constant , which controls the large scale behavior of the universe , is given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a bare cosmological constant in einstein s field equations .    we know from astronomical observations discussed later in sect",

    "_ , but supersymmetry is broken ( if it is realized in nature ) . hence we can at best expect a very imperfect cancellation below the electroweak scale , leaving a contribution of the order of @xmath116 .",
    "( the contributions at higher energies may largely cancel if supersymmetry holds in the real world . )",
    "we would reasonably expect that the vacuum energy density is at least as large as the condensation energy density of the qcd phase transition to the broken phase of chiral symmetry .",

    "@xmath119 in the qcd vacuum which break chirality , one also expects a gluon condensate @xmath120 this produces a significant vacuum energy density as a result of a dilatation anomaly : if @xmath121 denotes the `` classical '' trace of the energy - momentum tensor , we have @xcite @xmath122 where the second term is the qcd piece of the trace anomaly ( @xmath123 is the @xmath124-function of qcd that determines the running of the strong coupling constant ) .",
    "i recall that this arises because a scale transformation is no more a symmetry if quantum corrections are included .",
    "taking the vacuum expectation value of ( 32 ) , we would again naively expect that @xmath125 is of the order @xmath116 . even if this should vanish for some unknown reason ,",
    "the anomalous piece is cosmologically gigantic .",
    "the expectation value @xmath126 can be estimated with qcd sum rules @xcite , and gives    @xmath127    about 45 orders of magnitude larger than @xmath118 .",

    "let us also have a look at the higgs condensate of the electroweak theory . recall that in the standard model we have for the higgs doublet @xmath128 in the broken phase for @xmath129 the potential @xmath130 setting as usual @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the value of @xmath133 where @xmath134 has its minimum , @xmath135 we find that the higgs mass is related to @xmath136 by @xmath137 .",

    "this remark is also highly relevant for models of inflation and quintessence .    in attempts beyond the standard model",

    "the luminosity distance for an ideal friedmann universe was always used .",
    "but the data were taken in the real inhomogeneous universe .",

    "the simplest way to take this into account is to introduce a filling parameter which , roughly speaking , represents matter that exists in galaxies but not in the intergalactic medium . for a constant filling parameter",
    "one can determine the luminosity distance by solving the dyer - roeder equation .",
    "but now one has an additional parameter in fitting the data . for a flat universe",
    "this was recently investigated in @xcite .",
    "by observing the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) we can directly infer how the universe looked at the time of recombination . beside its spectrum , which is planckian to an incredible degree @xcite",
    ", we also can study the temperature fluctuations over the `` cosmic photosphere '' at a redshift @xmath229 . through these",
    "we get access to crucial cosmological information ( primordial density spectrum , cosmological parameters , etc ) . a major reason for why this is possible relies on the fortunate circumstance that the fluctuations are tiny ( @xmath230 ) at the time of recombination .",
    "this allows us to treat the deviations from homogeneity and isotropy for an extended period of time perturbatively , i.e. , by linearizing the einstein and matter equations about solutions of the idealized friedmann - lematre models . since the physics is effectively _ linear _ , we can accurately work out the _ evolution _ of the perturbations during the early phases of the universe , given a set of cosmological parameters .",
    "confronting this with observations , tells us a lot about the initial conditions , and thus about the physics of the very early universe . through this window to the earliest phases of cosmic evolution we can",
    ", for instance , test general ideas and specific models of inflation .",
    "long before recombination ( at temperatures @xmath231 , say ) photons , electrons and baryons were so strongly coupled that these components may be treated together as a single fluid .",

    "the investigation of such a two - component fluid for small deviations from an idealized friedmann behavior is a well - studied application of cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "( for the basic equations and a detailed analytical study , see @xcite and @xcite . )    at a later stage , when decoupling is approached , this approximate treatment breaks down because the mean free path of the photons becomes longer ( and finally ` infinite ' after recombination ) .",

    "the latter is , of course , again linearized about the idealized friedmann solution .",

    "a characteristic scale , which is reflected in the observed cmb anisotropies , is the sound horizon at last scattering , i.e. , the distance over which a pressure wave can propagate until @xmath232 .",
    "this can be computed within the unperturbed model and subtends about one degree on the sky for typical cosmological parameters . for scales larger than this sound horizon",
    "the fluctuations have been laid down in the very early universe .",
    "these have been detected by the cobe satellite .",
    "the ( brightness ) temperature perturbation @xmath233 ( defined precisely in eq.(88 ) below ) is dominated by the combination of the intrinsic temperature fluctuations and gravitational redshift or blueshift effects .",
    "for example , photons that have to climb out of potential wells for high - density regions are redshifted . in sect.6.1.5",
    "it is shown that these effects combine for adiabatic initial conditions to @xmath234 , where @xmath235 is the gravitational bardeen potential ( see eq.(73 ) ) .",
    "the latter , in turn , is directly related to the density perturbations . for scale - free initial perturbations",
    "the corresponding angular power spectrum of the temperature fluctuations turns out to be nearly flat ( sachs - wolfe plateau in fig.3 ) .",
    "the @xmath236 plotted in fig.3 are defined in ( 109 ) as the expansion coefficients of the angular correlation function in terms of legendre polynomials .    on the other hand , inside the sound horizon ( for @xmath237 ) , acoustic , doppler , gravitational redshift , and photon diffusion effects",
    "combine to the spectrum of small angle anisotropies shown in fig.3 .",
    "these result from gravitationally driven acoustic oscillations of the photon - baryon fluid , which are damped by photon diffusion ( sect.6.1.4 ) .",
    "unavoidably , the detailed implementation of what has just been outlined is somewhat complicated , because we are dealing with quite a large number of dynamical variables .",
    "this is not the place to develop cosmological perturbation theory in any detail , but i have to introduce some of it .      because we are dealing with slightly perturbed friedmann spacetimes we may regard the various perturbation amplitudes as time dependent functions on a three - dimensional riemannian space @xmath238 of constant curvature @xmath239 .",
    "since such a space is highly symmetrical we are invited to perform two types of decompositions .    in a first step we split the perturbations into _",

    "inclusion of baryons not only changes the sound speed , but gravitational infal leads to greater compression of the fluid in a potential well , and thus to a further displacement of the oscillation zero point ( last term in(127 ) .",
    "this is not compensated by the redshift after last scattering , since the latter is not affected by the baryon content . as a result",
    "all peaks from compression are enhanced over those from rarefaction .",

    "we shall see that the inferred baryon abundance from the present observations is in complete agreement with the results from big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "what is the influence of the slow evolution of the effective mass @xmath406 ?",

    "another beautiful result has to be stressed . for the baryon parameter @xmath442",
    "there is now full agreement between the cmb results and the bbn prediction .",
    "earlier speculations in connection with possible contradictions now have evaporated .",
    "the significance of this consistency can not be overemphasized .",
    "all this looks very impressive .",
    "it is , however , not forbidden to still worry about possible complications located in the initial conditions , for which we have no established theory .",
    "for example , an isocurvature admixture can not be excluded and the primordial power spectrum may have unexpected features .",
    "temperature measurements will not allow us to isolate the contribution of gravitational waves .",
    "this can only be achieved with future sensitive polarization experiments .",
    "polarization information will provide crucial clues about the physics of the very early universe .",
    "it can , for instance , be used to discriminate between models of inflation . with the _ planck _ satellite , currently scheduled for launch in february 2007",
    ", it will be possible to detect gravitational waves even if they contribute only 10 percent to the anisotropy signal .",
    "for the time being , we have to live with the mystery of the incredible smallness of a gravitationally effective vacuum energy density . for most physicists",
    "it is too much to believe that the vacuum energy constitutes the missing two thirds of the average energy density of the _ present _ universe .",
    "this would really be bizarre .",
    "the goal of quintessence models is to avoid such an extreme fine - tuning . in many ways",
    "people thereby repeat what has been done in inflationary cosmology .",
    "the main motivation there was , as is well - known , to avoid excessive fine tunings of standard big bang cosmology ( horizon and flatness problems ) .",
    "in concrete models the exotic missing energy with negative pressure is again described by a scalar field , whose potential is chosen such that the energy density of the homogeneous scalar field adjusts itself to be comparable to the matter density today for quite generic initial conditions , and is dominated by the potential energy .",
    "this ensures that the pressure becomes sufficiently negative .",
    "it is not simple to implement this general idea such that the model is phenomenologically viable .",
    "for instance , the success of bbn should not be spoiled .",
    "cmb and large scale structure impose other constraints .",
    "one also would like to understand why cosmological acceleration started at about @xmath450 , and not much earlier or in the far future .",
    "there have been attempts to connect this with some characteristic events in the post - recombination universe . on a fundamental level ,",
    "the origin of a quintessence field that must be extremely weakly coupled to ordinary matter , remains in the dark .",
    "there is already an extended literature on the subject",
    "@xcite - @xcite give a small selection of important early papers and some recent reviews .",
    "i conclude by emphasizing again that on the basis of the vacuum energy problem we would expect a huge additive constant for the quintessence potential that would destroy the hole picture .",
    "thus , assuming for instance that the potential approaches zero as the scalar field goes to infinity , has ( so far ) no basis .",
    "fortunately , future more precise observations will allow us to decide whether the presently dominating exotic energy density satisfies @xmath451 or whether this ratio is somewhere between @xmath452 and @xmath453 .",
    "recent studies ( see @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) which make use of existing cmb data , sn ia observations and other information do not yet support quintessence with @xmath454 .",
    "however , even if convincing evidence for this should be established , we will not be able to predict the distant future of the universe .",
    "eventually , the quintessence energy density may perhaps become  negative .",
    "this illustrates that we may never be able to predict the asymptotic behavior of the most grandiose of all dynamical systems .",
    "other conclusions are left to the reader .",
