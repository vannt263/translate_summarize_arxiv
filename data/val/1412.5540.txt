    "we start by considering an elementary higgs boson in a world without low energy supersymmetry . in this world there are two conflicting demands on the nature of new physics on higher mass scales .",
    "naturalness strongly constrains the new physics to prevent unwanted contributions to the higgs mass .",
    "either the new physics mass scale can not be much higher than the higgs mass or the higgs coupling to the new physics must be extremely weak .",
    "the other demand on the new physics is that it must significantly alter the running of couplings , including the quartic coupling of the higgs .",
    "this is because the landau poles in the quartic coupling and the @xmath0 hypercharge coupling would signal new mass scales of the dangerous type . to avoid this requires new massive degrees of freedom that do couple to standard model fields and thus are also dangerous for naturalness .",
    "these two demands are suggesting that if there is new physics to cure the landau problem then it must enter at as low a scale as possible to minimize the naturalness problem .",
    "the absence of landau poles is a requirement for the theory to be uv complete , or in other words that there is a description of the theory on arbitrarily high energy scales in terms of elementary fields .",
    "the fermions and gauge bosons of asymptotically free gauge theories are prime examples of truly elementary fields .",
    "the standard model is not of this type , but it often thought that there is no reason it should be given the presence of gravity . the onset of gravitational effects at planckian energies is usually taken to mean that the theory experiences a complete change of character on these scales .",
    "but once again this is at odds with naturalness .",
    "it is only if gravity somehow exerts only a very minimal effect on the scalar sector in a uv complete theory is there is any hope of naturalness .",
    "there have been recent attempts to show how the effects of gravity in uv complete quantum field theories could be consistent with naturalness . ref .",
    "@xcite illustrated a proposed mechanism in a 2d model of quantum gravity .",
    "these authors introduce the concept of `` gravitational dressing '' of a qft , where planck mass effects modify the s - matrix directly without inducing any physical mass scales .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) suggests that the pure gravitational action in the high energy regime just contains two terms , an @xmath1 term and the weyl term @xmath2 .",
    "the einstein - hilbert term is induced via the vev of a new scalar field with non - minimal coupling to @xmath3 .",
    "the point is that the gravitational interactions may then be both renormalizable and asymptotically free @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "@xcite argues that such a gravity sector could be arranged to couple sufficiently weakly to the standard model fields to preserve naturalness .",
    "the gravity sector here is not quite complete because of a ghost and a tachyon in the spectrum .",
    "our interest here is the other half of the problem , how to build uv complete quantum field theories containing truly elementary scalar fields .",
    "we approach this by searching for gauge theories containing both fermions and scalars where all couplings run to zero in the uv .",
    "this could provide a completely asymptotically free extension ( cafe ) of the standard model .",
    "a nice study of this type was conducted long ago in @xcite . there",
    "the constraints were found on theories with a simple gauge group with varying numbers of scalar fields in various representations and with fermions .",
    "gauge , quartic and yukawa couplings were considered .",
    "cafes were found and described in terms of uv fixed points ( uvfps ) where ratios of couplings approached fixed values .",
    "the fixed points were also required to be uv attractive from all directions in coupling space .",
    "thus these are cafes that also have complete uv stability , and we denote such an extension of the standard model as a safe .",
    "that such theories were found in @xcite may have been of interest to the construction of grand unified theories .",
    "but the study showed that it was difficult for the scalars that were allowed to sufficiently break down the original gauge theory via the higgs mechanism .",
    "for this reason and perhaps also because it was thought that gravity would nevertheless provide an ultraviolet cutoff , it appears that safes were never considered to be of particular importance in guts .",
    "our work can be considered to be a continuation of this old work . since we need to embed the standard model into a gauge group without a @xmath0 factor at the lowest possible scale we are here dealing with low scale unification .",
    "thus we must extend the original work to semi - simple gauge groups .",
    "a minimal requirement is that the scalar content of the theory must yield the higgs doublet after symmetry breaking .",
    "we do nt require that the scalars be entirely responsible for gauge symmetry breaking , other than electroweak symmetry breaking , since we leave open the possibility that strong interactions could dynamically break some symmetries .",
    "after the work @xcite there were attempts to find other realistic cafes , not necessarily grand unified . from our point of view these attempts were not completely successful since uv stability was dropped ( see review @xcite and references therein and in particular @xcite ) .",
    "the fixed point was allowed to be uv repulsive in some directions in coupling space . in this case",
    "the space of couplings that do flow to the fixed point has reduced dimensionality .",
    "this amounts to constraints ( sometimes called predictions ) on the low energy couplings that are also affected by higher order corrections . satisfying the constraints",
    "would require fine tuning the couplings order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "in our work we shall insist on complete uv stability .",
    "much more recently there has been another attempt to find uv complete theories with elementary scalars , but this time the search was for _ nontrivial _",
    "uvfps @xcite .",
    "unlike the case of asymptotic freedom , here the fixed point requires knowledge of the @xmath4-functions beyond lowest order .",
    "interesting examples were found but here again complete uv stability was not attained . also , in this context",
    "the work in @xcite suggests that the transition from a regime of running couplings to a nontrivial uvfp is sufficient to cause a contribution to the higgs mass .",
    "so in this case as well , the corresponding mass scale must be as low as possible .",
    "the prototype of low scale unification is the pati - salam model @xcite , based on the gauge group @xmath5 , with the fermions of one family in the ( 4 , 2 , 1)@xmath64 , 1 , 2)@xmath7 representation .",
    "our study will answer the question as to whether scalars can be added such that a safe results .",
    "but we shall set up our study in a more general context where we consider products of various @xmath8 gauge groups with various scalars that may transform simultaneously under two or three of these gauge groups .",
    "we only consider scalars in the fundamental representation since then we can expect a higgs doublet to emerge after symmetry breaking",
    ". these results may be of more general interest for model building .",
    "since we are discussing theories that are uv complete above the planck scale , one might wonder about the effect of gravity on the running couplings of the matter fields .",
    "this was discussed in the quadratic higher derivative gravity theories of @xcite .",
    "the coupling @xmath9 , appearing as @xmath10 times the weyl term , is always asymptotically free with both gravity and matter fields contributing with the same sign to the @xmath4-function .",
    "this means that @xmath9 is typically much smaller than the gauge couplings in the deep uv , and so its effect can be neglected .",
    "the coupling @xmath11 appearing in the @xmath1 term will be asymptoticallly free only if the ratio @xmath12 becomes negative in the uv .",
    "depending on the matter content it is possible that @xmath11 could run relatively slowly and thus play a more significant role . here",
    "we note a discrepancy in the calculated @xmath11 contribution to the scalar quartic @xmath4-functions in @xcite and @xcite . in the following",
    "we shall ignore the possible effect of gravity on the matter @xmath4-functions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ review ] we first review the basic idea to realize safes with a simple lie group . then we generalize the study to a semi - simple gauge group in sec .",
    "[ general ] , as motivated by low scale unification . for quantitative study",

    "in this section we review the basic idea to realize safes in @xcite .",
    "this reference systematically studied the simple group @xmath8 or @xmath13 case with fermions and scalars in various representations . here",
    "we supplement their work with some numerical results for comparison with our later analysis .",
    "since we study uv asymptotic freedom , the one loop @xmath4-functions are sufficient to study the uv behavior . at one loop",
    "the coupled @xmath4-functions of gauge , yukawa and quartic couplings can be solved sequentially . for the gauge coupling ,",
    "its @xmath4-function only depends on itself and yields @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 gives asymptotic freedom with an infrared landau pole at @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the @xmath4-function coefficient @xmath19 gives the running speed of gauge coupling at large @xmath20 .",
    "for the yukawa coupling @xmath21 , its @xmath4-function has the generic form @xmath22 where @xmath23 . the dependence on @xmath24",
    "can be eliminated with a change of variables @xmath25 , and this gives @xmath26\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where dependence on @xmath19 has appeared . to have asymptotically free @xmath21 amounts to finding a uvfp for @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath28 and since @xmath29 by definition the only uvfp is @xmath30 , which is uv repulsive .",
    "a stable uvfp requires that @xmath31 in which case @xmath30 is the stable uvfp .",
    "the result is that @xmath32 decreases asymptotically as @xmath33 as clarified in @xcite , the same conclusion applies to the more complicated case when the yukawa couplings are described by a matrix .",
    "so in safes , the contribution of yukawa couplings is negligible in the @xmath4-functions of quartic couplings in the deep uv .",
    "the one loop @xmath4-function of a scalar quartic coupling is in general a function of both gauge and yukawa couplings , but as we have just explained we ignore the latter .",
    "we may illustrate the general features with one scalar @xmath34 in the fundamental representation of a @xmath35 gauge group .",
    "the gauge invariant scalar potential at @xmath36 has only one term , @xmath37 the one loop @xmath4-function for @xmath38 is @xmath39 this @xmath4-function is composed of three pieces : the positive pure quartic terms , negative gauge - quartic terms and positive pure gauge terms . to have @xmath40 the three contributions should be comparable and so this disfavors a large hierarchy between quartic and gauge couplings . in particular quartic couplings must also run as @xmath41 in the deep uv .",
    "we may again eliminate the dependence on @xmath24 by a change of variables @xmath42 , and this gives @xmath43    + \\frac{3(n-1)(n^2 + 2n-2)}{4n^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 again appearing in the linear term . defining @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the pure gauge boson contribution , the regions with @xmath46 and @xmath47 meet at the value @xmath48 .",
    "these two regions correspond to the slow gauge running @xmath49 and fast gauge running ( @xmath50 ) cases respectively , and there is a one - to - one mapping with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 is simply a quadratic equation for @xmath54 and there are two real roots when @xmath55 ^ 2-\\frac{12}{n^2}(n+4)(n-1)(n^2 + 2n-2)>0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this inequality sets an upper ( lower ) bound on @xmath56 in the slow ( fast ) running region with solutions @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) . for the present example the lower bound on @xmath56 in the branch @xmath59 is always above one and so this can not be realized with any matter assignment .",
    "also this region is disfavored due to the upper bound on @xmath56 from the uv stability of yukawa coupling and the vacuum stability condition for the quartic coupling @xmath57 .",
    "so we need only consider the slow running region , where the inequality ( [ eq : nabacond ] ) sets @xmath60 .      the maximum @xmath61 for one fundamental scalar of @xmath8 and the minimum number @xmath62 of dirac fundamental fermions to achieve this.,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ]    for each @xmath60 , we present the upper bound on @xmath63 for various @xmath64 in fig .

    ", a larger @xmath64 may be required to achieve a safe .",
    "this generally does not allow sufficient scalar fields to break the simple gauge group in some realistic manner @xcite .",
    "for example @xmath80 grand unification typically requires two scalars , in the adjoint and fundamental representations , to break @xmath80 down to the sm . but with this set of scalars the theory is a safe only if @xmath81 .    for a given gauge group ,",
    "the larger the total number of scalar degrees of freedom , the tighter is the constraint on @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this general feature will carry over to our generalizations and it is another motivation to restrict ourselves to scalars in the fundamental representation .",
    "motivated by low scale unification we shall focus on scalar fields transforming under the following two types of gauge groups with @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83 we first discuss the behavior of yukawa couplings for the semi - simple case . in the simplest case of a single yukawa coupling @xmath21 , as a generalization of the @xmath4-function in ( [ eq : yukawabeta2 ] ) we find @xmath84 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 and with @xmath86 one of the gauge couplings .",
    "the @xmath87 depend on the scalar and fermion representations . in the deep",

    "we have checked various fermion and scalar representations for the gauge groups in ( [ eq : semilie ] ) .",
    "it turns out that ( [ eq : yukawasuvfpcond ] ) is easy to satisfy since @xmath91 and @xmath92 is negative . in some cases ( [ eq : yukawasuvfpcond ] ) may put a upper bound on @xmath92 , but as we shall see below , in the parameter space of interest the constraint is much weaker than constraints from the quartic couplings . for a matrix of yukawa couplings we expect these features will continue to hold , as in @xcite .",
    "therefore in our study of safes for semi - simple gauge group we will focus on the quartic couplings and neglect the contribution of yukawa couplings in their @xmath4-functions .",
    "we now build four benchmarks for semi - simple lie groups in ( [ eq : semilie ] ) .      for the gauge group @xmath93 the simplest nontrivial setup is to have one scalar field @xmath95 that transforms in the fundamental representation of both groups , i.e. @xmath94 . the most general @xmath36 scalar potential is @xmath96 when at least one @xmath97 .",

    "a safe could be extended to gravity if gravity is also asymptotically free , as is the case for quadratic higher derivative gravity theories .",
    "in such a theory all coupling ratios , including gravitational couplings , may be fixed in the deep uv .",
    "in this case the ratios of the non gravitational couplings at this ultimate fixed point may differ from what we have described here .    in summary our results",
    "show that it might be possible to construct realistic completely asymptotically free gauge theories with complete uv stability containing both fermions and scalars in context of semi - simple gauge groups .",
    "this is in contrast to the studies reviewed in @xcite that typically suffer from uv instability .",
