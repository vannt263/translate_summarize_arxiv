    "we then demonstrate that cyclic relations of four and more species result in many isolated stable patches when one of the species spontaneously dies out due to noise .",

    "we observe that the transition from low- to high - diversity occurs at time @xmath46 , and from high- to low - diversity at time @xmath47 .",
    "the transition looks rather sudden on this scale , but in fact it develops over thousands of time units . in addition , the transition from high to low diversity is not simply a reversal of the transition from low to high .",
    "rather , in both directions , the change in diversity is preceded by a change in patch size .",
    "this tendency is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ patchtimeseries](b ) , which shows average patchiness vs. diversity over  100 transitions in both directions .",
    "figure  [ patchtimeseries](b ) also shows that , when the system is in the high diversity state ( open circles ) , the patchiness stays at a high constant value , even though the diversity fluctuates between around 10 and 60 .",
    "in contrast , when the system is at low diversity , the patchiness - diversity plot follows the branch of the high- to low - diversity transition ( data not shown ) .",
    "therefore a substantial increase of patchiness is the necessary condition for reaching the stable high diversity state .",
    "emergence of spatial fragmentation through patch creation is essential for creation of biodiversity in our model .",
    "there are , however , two fundamentally different ways to create patches , both using the stochastic fragmentation occurring when one or more species are driven to local extinction .",
    "first we show in fig .",
    "[ patch1 ] that patches can be created by a purely linear relationship with , for example , three species a @xmath48 b @xmath48 c. while a and c alone can coexist stably with a well defined fixed border , the introduction of b makes it possible for a to invade the territory of c. first , b could , if undisturbed , completely eliminate c. however , when scavenging the borders of the region occupied by c , b encounters a , which can invade b. a will then immediately start invading the area of b in parallel with b s invasion of c. as the dynamics is noisy , occasional patches of c will be left behind within the region of species a , because a can not invade c directly .",
    "a second mechanism for patch creation is associated with cyclic relationships .",
    "`` active '' cycles are known to produce many fragmented areas , due to a continuous activity of invasions .",
    "however , this activity collapses if one of the species goes extinct . in the case of a three - cycle ( a@xmath49b@xmath49c@xmath49a , ",
    "`` rock - paper - scissors '' ) , the collapse leads to a homogeneous state with a single species ( e.g. , if a dies out , b will fully invade the area covered by c ) .",
    "however , if the cycle length is greater than or equals to four , there is a possibility that a finite number of patches are left even after the dynamics spontaneously has come to a stop due to the stochastic extinction of one of the species ( e.g. in a cycle of a@xmath49b@xmath49c@xmath49d@xmath49a , if a dies out and b displaces c before c can displace d , then b and d will coexist ) .",
    "thereby , a large enough cycle can create stationary patches without requiring long - lasting dynamics .    to study patch creation through cycles and their stochastic termination , we show in fig .",
    "[ cyclelife ] a systematic investigation of the number of patches produced when a cyclic relationship is terminated due to the stochastic extinction of one species . for a given cycle of length @xmath50",
    ", we initiate @xmath50 species with a cyclic relationship by randomly distributing the species in a square lattice of size @xmath51 .",
    "we let the system evolve until the dynamics spontaneously comes to a halt .",
    "[ cyclelife ] shows the average number of patches left when a cycle is terminated as a function of system size @xmath25 .",
    "it is clear that , even though the long cycles do not live as long as the short cycles ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ cyclelife ] ) , they will create more patches when they terminate .",
    "interestingly , the patchiness @xmath45 increases with the system size @xmath25 with an exponent close to @xmath52 .     and",
    "@xmath53 collapses due to fluctuations associated with the stochastic update of the system .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the scaling @xmath54 .",

    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]      in order to examine which mechanism of patch creation is the most relevant for maintaining the high diversity , we run the quasistatic version of the model , where a new species is inserted into the system only after all the activity in the system has stopped .",
    "occasionally , however , there will be long periods where several species compete dynamically for the same area .",
    "this is typically due to cycles of length 2 or 3 , which have quite a long life time ( fig .",
    "[ cyclelife ] inset ; see also fig .",
    "[ quasistatic]bc ) . to shorten these periods",
    ", we perform the following procedure if the dynamics goes on for a time longer than @xmath56 : ( i ) when the active period reaches @xmath56 , randomly choose one of the active species ( species that can invade its neighbor ) , @xmath57 .",

    "the quasistatic simulation reflects the biologically interesting limit where the introduction of new species happens at a much slower than any ecological dynamics arising from species interaction and can , hence , be interpreted as resulting from speciation ( rather than immigration ) .",
    "in @xcite we have confirmed that the quasistatic simulation has two metastable states when @xmath61 , one with a high diversity and one absorbing state where @xmath62 .",

    "simulation were started from a state of high diversity ( taken from the steady state with @xmath67 and @xmath23 ) , but with all interactions ( i.e. , elements in @xmath8 for initially existing species ) set to zero at time @xmath68 .",
    "subsequently , whenever a new species was introduced , the corresponding entries in the interaction matrix @xmath8 were determined according to the given value of @xmath0 , but if it would result in a cyclic relationship of length less than @xmath69 , the species was rejected , and a new species is introduced , which again was assigned random interactions according to @xmath0 . in this way , only cycles of length @xmath70 and above can be created .",
    "the resulting diversity in the steady state for a system of size @xmath26 with @xmath23 and 0.025 is shown in fig . [ quasistatic](a ) .",
    "the axis label @xmath71 indicates @xmath72 , which is the original quasistatic simulation where all cycles are allowed .",
    "the axis labels of , for example , `` @xmath73 '' corresponds to @xmath74 , which allows all cycles of length @xmath73 .",
    "interestingly , removing cycles of length @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 even increases diversity , but further removal drastically reduces it .",
    "when cycles are of length 6 and larger , the system collapses to a single species ( @xmath62 ) with @xmath23 , while for @xmath66 a diversity@xmath78 is maintained .",
    "however , when even more cycles are removed , also the system with @xmath66 collapses to the @xmath62 state .",
    "accordingly , the cycles of length 5 and 6 , in particular , crucially influence the transition point .",
    "this also indicates that patch creation by linear relationships , which should be present all the time , is not enough for maintaining high diversity .",
    "the frequency of appearance of active cycles in the quasistatic simulation with @xmath72 is investigated in fig .",
    "[ quasistatic](b ) and ( c ) , which shows the probability of having an active cycles of a certain length at a time @xmath65 after the introduction of a new species for ( b ) @xmath23 and ( c ) @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the length of the active cycle for a given moment is defined as the largest cycle within active species .",
    "we can see that , at @xmath79 , there are many active cycles , but they vanish as time passes , and at @xmath80 , most of the cycles left are of length 2 and 3 , which do not leave patches .",
    "this again demonstrates that the long - lasting dynamics is not essential for keeping high diversity . or , in other words , long lasting sustainable biodiversity is associated with patch creation occurring on a short timescale via the break - down of cyclic relationships .",
    "it should also be noted that , even for @xmath79 , the frequency of active cycle decreases with cycle length , as seen in figs .",
    "[ quasistatic ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "thereby cycles of length 4 - 6 become central for the creation of patches : shorter cycles can not create patches and longer cycles are too rare to make a difference .",
    "we investigated the mechanism maintaining high biodiversity in a simple model ecosystem .",
    "high diversity is maintained if inter - species interaction parameter @xmath0 is below a critical value @xmath40 . in the vicinity of @xmath81",
    ", the model shows bistability .",
    "one stable state is characterized by low diversity , which goes to @xmath62 as the rate of introduction of new species @xmath1 approaches zero .",
    "the other stable state is the high - diversity state , which exists even in the @xmath32 limit .",
    "the transition from low- to high - diversity is triggered by a spontaneous increase of patchiness , while the collapse from high to low diversity is preceded by a decrease in patchiness .",
    "thus the two transitions follow different paths :    *   the transition from low to high diversity is driven by the collapse of extended cyclic relations that create multiple patches of one species ( metapopulations ) within the range of another species .",
    "each of these patches can subsequently serve as a seed or a shelter for newly arriving species .",
    "*   the transition from high to low diversity is preceded by a reduction in patchiness .",
    "low patchiness is equivalent to a lack of spatially separated shelters , leading to suppression of coexistence of antagonistic species .",
    "we further found that in order to maintain a balance between collapse and sustained patchiness , the system relies on very short - lived cyclic relationships involving more than five species , whose collapse creates a mosaic of mutually compatible species .",
    "there still remain open questions in the transition observed in the model .",
    "one question is the cut - off of the patch size , which is independent of @xmath0 and @xmath25 ( fig.[1200sys ] ) ; we do not understand where the length scale comes from .",
    "another interesting observation is that , in the histogram of diversity in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] , the boundaries between the high and low diversity states are rather @xmath0 independent ( around 15 ) , even though the position of the peak in the high - diversity state clearly changes with @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0-independent boundary might suggest the existence of a critical minimal biodiversity @xmath82 needed to ensure the stability of a high - diversity state .",
    "a minimal @xmath82 also translates into a minimal system size of @xmath83 to support the high - biodiversity state .",
    "a natural extension of the model would be to include a death rate that create empty sites , which can be recolonized from neighboring sites ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is equivalent to a small probability of species @xmath13 invading a site occupied by species @xmath22 even if @xmath84 .",
    "previously @xcite , we tested the effect of death by emptying a fraction of sites prior to the introduction of new species in a quasistatic simulation .",
    "we found that the sharp transition to high diversity is maintained as long as this fraction is less than 10% . with finite @xmath1",
    ", the transition is softened by a death rate that is small relative to @xmath1 .",
    "if the death rate is high compared to @xmath1 , diversity is expected to collapse .",
    "how exactly the transition between high- and low - diversity states depends on @xmath1 and the death rate is a biologically relevant question , which we plan to investigate in the future .",
