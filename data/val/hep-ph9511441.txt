    "it has been proposed by magahiz et al .",
    "@xcite to observe the reaction @xmath2 with the clas large acceptance spectrometer at cebaf to gain insight into strangeness electroproduction of nuclei .",
    "if the longitudinal and transverse part of the differential cross section could be separated , the t - channel reaction would allow the measurement of the @xmath0 electromagnetic form factor which due to the mass difference between the strange and down quarks does non vanish .",
    "in view of this proposed experiment predictions for the @xmath0 form factor have been recently published and it commonly turned out that due to the accessible values of momentum transfer up to few @xmath3 a covariant description of the underlying dynamics is mandatory .",
    "cardarelli et al .",
    "investigated a relativistic constituent quark model based on the light front formalism @xcite .",
    "therein they made use of an interaction kernel motivated by an effective @xmath1 - hamiltonian which has been developed by godfrey and isgur @xcite . in another paper buck",
    ", williams and ito @xcite calculated the @xmath4 and @xmath5 form factors by employing a model described in @xcite , with a separable ansatz including symmetry breaking effects .",
    "in two previous papers @xcite we presented a covariant quark model based on the salpeter equation and used it to compute ( transition ) form factors between the light pseudoscalar and vector mesons @xcite .",
    "this brief report shall serve as an extension of the latter to the neutral strange meson .",
    "starting from the bethe - salpeter equation , we use a @xmath1 - interaction assumed instantaneous in the rest frame of the bound state and free effective quark propagators to arrive at the salpeter equation , which is expressed as an eigenvalue problem for the bound state mass and solved numerically @xcite .",
    "in addition to the calculation of mass spectra we have presented there a method to reconstruct the four - dimensional bethe - salpeter amplitude from the equal - time salpeter amplitudes .    in our model the interaction",
    "consists of a confining potential which is linearly rising in coordinate space , and an instanton - induced interaction derived by ( see @xcite and references therein ) as a possible solution of the u@xmath6(1)-problem .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the potential and mass parameters used in our model have been fixed in @xcite to obtain a reasonable agreement with the experimental mass spectrum of the low lying pseudoscalar and vector mesons as well as the leptonic @xmath4 and @xmath7 decay widths .",
    "the electromagnetic form factors as well as the other decay widths ( e.g. @xmath8 ) are consistently obtained by employing the mandelstam formalism to the formerly calculated bethe - salpeter amplitudes .",
    "no additional parameter is used to calculate the current matrix elements . in lowest order",
    "we find for the electromagnetic current coupling to the quark : @xmath9 \\gamma_{\\mu }    \\chi_p(x , y )    \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is formally analogous to the results obtained by buck et al .",
    "@xcite except for the inner structure of the amputated bethe - salpeter amplitude , which in our model contains in general eight amplitudes for fixed spin and parity @xcite and thus reflects the full dirac structure of the @xmath1 - system .",
    "our results for the @xmath0 form factor @xmath10 are shown in fig .",
    "[ abb1 ] and [ abb2 ] for small and large momentum transfer ( in fig .",
    "[ abb2 ] we plotted @xmath11 ) .",
    "our calculation agrees remarkably well with the prediction of buck et al .",
    "@xcite , where the parameter have been fixed to reproduce the @xmath12 and @xmath13 charge radii and decay constants . however , our maximum of @xmath11 appears at a smaller momentum transfer of approximately 2 gev@xmath14 .    as our calculation has been performed in the framework of a covariant quark model which includes confinement , and therefore is able to describe not only the masses and decay properties of the pseudoscalars but also of the vector mesons , the @xmath0 form factor calculation is put on a more general basis than in the work of buck et al .",
    "@xcite , although our results do not differ significantly .    the @xmath0 charge radius , as has been discussed e.g.  in @xcite , is most sensitive to the mass difference between the strange and down quark mass .",
    "we have estimated the charge radius by a least - square fit of a quadratic function to our form factor below 0.1 gev@xmath14 and studied its dependence on the differences of the constituent quark masses @xmath15 keeping the sum of them fixed to our original value @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the results plotted in fig .",
    "[ abb3 ] indeed shows a strong dependence on the quark mass difference , as long as it is smaller than 250 mev .",
    "an experimental measurement of the @xmath0 charge radius therefore would be an interesting opportunity to determine the difference between strange and nonstrange constituent quark mass , alternatively to estimates from purely spectroscopic quark model calculations .",
