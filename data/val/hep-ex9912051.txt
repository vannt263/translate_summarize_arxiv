    "the discovery of asymptotic freedom is an important corner stone of the foundation of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as the theory of the strong interaction . despite the substantial effort in testing the predictions of this theory at e@xmath0e@xmath1 colliders like e.g.petra  @xcite and lep  @xcite ,",
    "qcd is less precisely surveyed than the electroweak sector of the standard model of electroweak and strong interaction .",
    "the precision of the determination of the strong coupling constant , @xmath2 , at centre - of - mass energies of up to @xmath11  gev at lep ii is only at the level of a few percent ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    to test the details of the running of @xmath2 , which means the asymptotic freedom",
    ", one has to strive for a precision of better than one percent .",
    "this could be achieved by a determination of @xmath2 at a linear collider operating at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath3 gev or above .",
    "it would provide a long lever arm for the test of the asymptotic freedom .",
    "besides the running of the coupling constant , qcd also predicts the value of the renormalised quark masses to depend on the scale of the interaction process  @xcite .",
    "first investigations of this running of the quark masses were performed by the lep and slc experiments  @xcite , which suffered from large statistical uncertainties .",
    "further experimental manifestation of the effect is , therefore , still required .",
    "this could be achieved at a linear collider due to its high luminosity and by using very high resolution silicon vertex detectors . here",
    "the silicon micro vertex detectors allow to distinguish bottom and charm quark flavours created by the annihilation process from the other lighter quarks .",
    "the identification of the primary quark flavour could furthermore be used to study the properties of quark and gluon jets .",
    "such studies have already be successfully conducted at lep i and slc ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . at the higher energies of lep ii , however , the data statistics is scarce for a significant investigation of the quark and gluon properties .",
    "again , a linear collider would allow such studies because of its high specific luminosity .",
    "apart from the advantage of very high luminosity , qcd studies at a linear collider also gain from the high centre - of - mass energy .",
    "this is because the impact of hadronisation , which blurs the view at the quarks and gluons , diminishes with a reciprocal power of the scale of the process .",
    "hence the distortion due to hadronisation effects at @xmath3  gev is only about @xmath12 of that at the z mass scale  @xcite .",
    "this article presents a scrutiny of the potential of the tesla linear collider to perform a determination of the strong coupling constant at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath3  gev .",
    "the study is restricted to an investigation based on monte carlo generator simulations using the pythia 5.722 @xcite , herwig 5.9 @xcite , and ariadne 4.8 @xcite programs which , except for herwig , have been tuned by the opal collaboration at lep  @xcite .",
    "these generators are used to simulate the production of quark - antiquark pairs from the annihilation . to account for the substantial production cross - section of massive gauge boson pairs ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , background from hadronic decays of z and w bosons is considered , where in addition also the decay w@xmath13 is included .",
    "all other leptonic decays of these massive bosons can easily be identified and , hence , rejected .",
    "likewise , background contributions from @xmath14 scattering and @xmath15 pair production are not included .",
    "their contribution can be removed very efficiently as is known from the experiments at lep ii ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the production of top quarks leads to significant effects .",
    "this is due to its large mass and the appearance of typically three jets of particles from its decay .",
    "top quark events , therefore , appear rather spherically in the detector , thus immitating multijet events .",
    "figure  [ fig - top - distortions ] shows the impact of the pair - produced top quarks on the thrust observable and the jet rates , both of which are usually used to determine the value of the strong coupling constant .",
    "it is therefore indispensable to exclude the contribution from top quarks when performing an @xmath2 determination .",
    "the impact of initial state radiation is accounted for using its next - to - leading order treatment in the pythia generator .",
    "radiative events constitute a large fraction of the hadronic final states , especially radiative returns to the z pole .",
    "most of these can easily be rejected by requiring the reconstructed mass of the whole event to be close to the centre - of - mass energy of the colliding beams .",
    "such a cut on the effective centre - of - mass energy , @xmath16 , is usually applied in the hadronic event selection at lep ii ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it effectively takes out radiative z return events as can be seen in figure  [ fig - isr+bs ] .",
    "beamstrahlung , which is of relevance at a linear collider only , is simulated using the program circe 1.28  @xcite which has been interfaced to the pythia generator .",
    "when using the parameters proposed for the tesla linear collider , only a negligible fraction of the events is lost due to beamstrahlung ( see figure  [ fig - isr+bs ] ) if the cut @xmath17 is applied which is usually used by the lep experiments .",
    "to study the prospects of a determination of @xmath2 at the tesla linear collider , an integrated luminosity of @xmath18 fb@xmath19 has been simulated .",
    "this corresponds to roughly one year of data taking at the design luminosity of the collider .",
    ".[tab - no - of - events ] approximate number of events for @xmath18  fb@xmath19 and the cross - sections taken from pythia  @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the error budget of an @xmath2 determination is compiled from different sources . since",
    "a perfect detector has been assumed , the corresponding experimental uncertainties are adopted from measurements at lep ii ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "effects due to the roughly @xmath20 background from boson pairs are neglected .",
    "the statistical uncertainty is estimated by considering a @xmath21 selection efficiency and an expected integrated luminosity of @xmath22 within one year .",
    "this corresponds to about @xmath23 million hadronic events which have been generated using the pythia generator employing the tuned set of parameters .",
    "the simulated events are used to assess the remaining uncertainties due to hadronisation corrections and due to the choice of the hadronisation parameters by fitting the @xmath4-matched second order ( @xmath5 ) and resummed calculations ( nlla ) to distributions of the observables in the hadronic final state .",
    "distributions from the thrust , heavy jetmass , total and wide jet broadening , @xmath24-parameter , and the @xmath25 to @xmath26-jet flip @xmath27 value , @xmath28 , obtained from the durham jet algorithm are used .",
    "hadronisation correction factors are applied to these distributions before fitting the theoretical expressions .",
    "the result of the fits is exemplified for thrust , heavy jetmass , wide jet broadening , and the jet flip in figure  [ fig - evshapes ] . in general good fits",
    "are obtained .",
    "however , for the heavy jetmass and the wide jet broadening an excursion of the fitted curve from the simulated data is visible at small values of these observables .",
    "this could indicate a problem of either the theoretical formulae or of the event generator program .",
    "the fit must , therefore , not go too far into this @xmath25-jet region , which represents the bulk of statistics indeed .",
    "finally , also the impact of a variation of the renormalisation scale factor , @xmath29 , is considered . as has become usual @xmath29 is varied from unity to @xmath23 and @xmath25 , respectively , assigning the change in @xmath30 as the uncertainty due to the choice of the renormalisation scale factor .",
    "table  [ tab - alphas - error - budget ] lists the individual contributions to the total uncertainty of @xmath2 at the z mass scale , @xmath31 . to calculate a total uncertainty ,",
    "the individual error contributions from all six observables are averaged for each systematic variation individually .",
    "the total error is then obtained by adding the individual contributions in quadrature . excluding the uncertainty derived when",
    "choosing the herwig generator to correct for hadronisation effects , because it is not tuned to the lep data yet , the total error becomes @xmath32 .",
    "this error incorporates a significant contribution of about @xmath33 due to the scale uncertainty .",
    "it should be noted that it is of similar size as the typical error obtained by the lep and slc experiments .",
    "the error @xmath34 corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "a feasibility study of the determination of the strong coupling constant , @xmath2 , at the tesla linear collider has been presented starting from the selection of hadronic events .",
    "neither initial state radiation nor beamstrahlung constitute a substantial problem for such a qcd investigation at this collider .",
    "the major background stems from the pair production of w and z bosons .",
    "both can be easily suppressed by cutting on the hemisphere masses and on the polar angle of the thrust axis .",
    "top quarks significantly distort event shape and jet rate distributions and must , therefore , also be excluded from an @xmath2 determination based on such observables .",
    "it has been found that a cut on the minimum value of the jet broadening effectively removes the contribution from top quarks without affecting the selection efficiency .",
    "the hadronisation corrections and the associated uncertainties are very small at tesla energies .",
    "however , the contribution from different hadronisation models could become a dominating source of error .",
    "fits of the @xmath4-matched second order and resummed calculations to six observables have been performed to assess the systematic uncertainties of the derived value of @xmath2 using data from monte carlo generators only .",
    "exerimental uncertainties have been adopted from the lep ii experiments and are found to be small .",
    "a very significant contribution to the total uncertainty of @xmath36 stems from the choice of the renormalisation scale .",
    "its absolute contribution will shrink with increasing centre - of - mass energy but the relative uncertainty is not diminished . to improve on the scale uncertainty theoretical calculations of third order in @xmath2",
    "are absolutely required .",
