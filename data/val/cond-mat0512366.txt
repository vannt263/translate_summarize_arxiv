    "the rotational diffusion model of debye @xcite was proposed originally to explain dielectric relaxation of polar molecules and to relate the observed relaxation time to viscosity by the use of the stokes - einstein relation .",
    "the debye - stokes - einstein ( dse ) model is primarily devised to model the brownian motion in orientational degrees of freedom .",
    "the dse model provides the following amazingly simple expression for the decay of the @xmath2-th rank orientational correlation function @xmath6 @xmath7 with@xmath8 where @xmath9 in the above expression of rotational friction , @xmath10 is the volume of the molecule in question , @xmath5 is the viscosity of the liquid , @xmath11 is boltzmann constant and @xmath12 is the temperature .",
    "the above expressions predict the ratio of the first and second - rank rotational correlation times , @xmath3 , to be equal to three . the higher rank rotational correlation times also vary following the @xmath13^{-1}$ ] dependence . in the past ,",
    "different aspects of dse relationship have been tested namely , ( a ) the shape dependence @xcite , ( b ) the viscosity dependence , and ( c ) the rank dependence of the orientational relaxation , in simple as well as complex liquids .    in many cases ,",
    "the ratio @xmath3 is found to fall below three . in particular , in supercooled liquids , the ratio is known to approach unity at low temperatures and related issues ( like translation - rotation decoupling ) that have given rise to considerable amount of discussion @xcite .",
    "one often invokes the breakdown of debye diffusion model , which requires small angle brownian rotational motion for its validity , due to the emergence of large scale hopping involving large angular jumps .",
    "the basic idea is that a large jump leads to the decay of @xmath6 of all rank @xmath2 at the same time , so that all of them have similar correlation times corresponding to the average waiting time for this large jump to occur .",
    "the case of @xmath3 deserves particular attention because it is the oft discussed one .",
    "the sensitivity of these two correlation times ( and hence the respective correlation functions ) to intermolecular interactions is different .",
    "when the rotating molecule has dipolar interactions with the surrounding molecules , one expects the first rank rotation to be more affected than the second rank one .",
    "this is a manifestation of intermolecular correlation which is reflected in the orientational pair correlation functions .",
    "thus , if we consider dipolar spheres ( such stockmayer liquid ) , we should expect the ratio @xmath3 to be larger than three . on the other hand ,",
    "if the intermolecular interaction has up - down symmetry ( as in the case of molecules with ellipsoid of revolution ) , the reverse could be true .",
    "thus , one may need to include the role of intermolecular correlation to generalize the dse model appropriately .",
    "one ideal candidate to test the above argument regarding the role of equilibrium pair correlations is a system of model mesogens undergoing the isotropic - nematic (",
    "i - n ) phase transition .",
    "the isotropic phase is both positionally and orientationally disordered while the nematic phase is still positionally disordered but orientationally ordered .",
    "earlier experimental and simulations studies @xcite have demonstrated that existence of the orientational relaxation of nematogens near i - n transition have similarities with that observed in the supercooled liquids .",
    "the orientational order parameter is defined by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the angle of the orientation of the molecular axis with the director . in the isotropic phase , @xmath16 for infinitely large systems while it is non - zero ( around 0.5 ) in the nematic phase .",
    "the important point is that orientational correlation undergoes rapid increase as the i - n phase boundary is approached from the isotropic side .",
    "this large growth in correlation would provide a testing ground of the rotational diffusion model and the role of intermolecular correlations .",
    "different molecular models have been used to test the dse in molecular simulations . in a molecular dynamics simulation study using the gay - berne intermolecular potential @xcite , de miguel _ et al .",
    "_ found the ratio @xmath3 to be always less than three in the isotropic phase .",
    "they found that the departure from the debye limit was pronounced when density was reduced or temperature was increased ; this deviation is a manifestation of the inertial decay which gives a ratio @xmath17 $ ] for @xmath18 .",
    "et al . _ in extensive molecular dynamics simulations using the same model have studied the aspect ratio dependence of the dse relationship @xcite . recently",
    "jose and bagchi have studied the breakdown of the dse relationship near the i - n phase transition in a system of the gay - berne ellipsoids of revolution @xcite .",
    "they have shown that the relation between the rotational friction and viscosity breaks down near the i - n phase transition .",
    "the motivation of the present work comes partly from recent reports of the observed similarity in the orientational relaxation between supercooled liquids and liquid crystals.@xcite the deviation of the rank dependence from the debye model ( eq.2 ) has been often discussed in the context of supercooled liquids . as discussed earlier , this is attributed to the existence of large angular jumps at low temperatures . in this work",
    ", we investigated the rank dependence of the rotational diffusion near the isotropic - nematic phase boundary .",
    "we find that the ratio @xmath3 becomes much less than unity as the isotropic - nematic phase boundary is approached from the isotropic side .",
    "simultaneously , the ratio @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the shear viscosity of the liquid ) becomes much larger than hydrodynamic value near the i - n transition .",
    "we have also analyzed the breakdown of the debye model of rotational diffusion in ratios of higher order rotational correlation times .",
    "theoretical analysis shows that the breakdown of the dse model can be attributed to the growth of orientational pair correlation .",
    "we provide a mode coupling theory analysis to explain the results .",
    "thus , the present analysis seems to suggest that one need not always invoke large scale jump diffusion to explain the decrease of the ratio @xmath3 from the debye limit .",
    "this view raises some interesting questions which we address in the conclusion .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the system and simulation details .",
    "results of our molecular dynamics simulation study of a system of ellipsoids of revolution with an aspect ratio equal to three along an isotherm and an isochore across the i - n phase transition is presented in the section [ sec : res ] .",

    "its appearance in dynamics suggests the existence of large scale fluctuations in the orientational order parameter @xcite .",
    "since the second rank orientational correlation function is associated with the optical response of the system which undergoes dramatic increase near the i - n transition @xcite , the most affected orientational memory function is the second - order one .",
    "microscopically this phenomenon may be understood qualitatively in terms of the molecular field theory of maier and saupe @xcite , where the molecule is confined in an effective field created by its neighbors . this effective potential",

    "the drop in temperature drives the system from the isotropic to the nematic phase with the growth in the orientational order .",
    "in particular , the single - particle second - rank orientational correlation function decays with such a long time scale near the i - n phase boundary that an integral second - rank orientational correlation time is beyond the scope of the present simulation study .",
    "the poor data quality at long times with the present run length restricts us from having a reasonable fit of the long - time decay . in order to have an estimate of the second - rank orientational correlation time for the sake of comparison of the rank - dependent orientational correlation times , we define a correlation time @xmath84 that is the time taken for the single - particle @xmath85th rank orientational correlation function to decay by 90% at a temperate @xmath12 .",

    "the ratios @xmath87 go through maxima on transit from the isotropic phase to the nematic phase for both @xmath88 and @xmath89 as shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : tmp - tau3b1-tau4b1 ] , and the maxima correspond to the temperature below which the orientational order parameter is on the rapid rise .",

    "the results , embodied in figs . [ cap : tmp - tau2b1-op]-[cap : tmp - tau3b2-tau4b2 ] , suggest that orientational correlation , that builds up across the i - n transition , plays a key role in deviation from the debye behavior of the orientational correlation times .",
    "the contrast between the study along an isotherm and that along an isochore reveals the importance of the role played by the intermolecular potential in the breakdown of the dse relation . in the study along the isotherm , the free volume that is available for the rotation reduces thus leading to the formation of the orientational caging .",
    "in contrast , when temperature is reduced , the attractive part of the inter molecular potential becomes more dominant and results in the formation of the orientational caging that arrests the orientational random walk of the molecules .",
    "the above difference arises because temperature variation leads only to small changes in density because of the dominance of the repulsive part of the potential in determining the liquid structure .",
    "here we present a mode coupling theory ( mct ) analysis of the above relaxation behaviour .",
    "mct has a long and honorable history in describing dynamics near phase transitions @xcite .",
    "our starting point of the theoretical analysis is the zwanzig - mori continued fraction representation of the frequency dependent orientational time correlation function , @xmath92 @xcite , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the moment of inertia and @xmath95 is the laplace frequency ( @xmath96 ) and rank dependent memory function .",
    "the latter is determined by the torque - torque correlation function . in general , it is very difficult to determine this correlation function from first principles , but as a first approximation , we would combine input from the mode coupling theory with that from the time dependent density functional theory to obtain an expression for the memory function , @xmath95 , which can be used to understand the reasons for the breakdown of the dse model .",
    "near the i - n transition the memory function @xmath97 can be written as a sum of two parts @xmath98 where the bare part of the memory function is assumed to be rank and frequency independent .",
    "this can be described by the two - body ( binary ) collision model .",
    "note that in conjunction with eq.[eq : clz ] , @xmath99 leads to the dse behaviour .",
    "the singular part of the memory function contains effects of intermolecular correlation and is rank dependent .",
    "it is given by @xcite , @xmath100 in the above equation , @xmath101 is the rank and frequency dependent memory function .",
    "this is a function of the @xmath102 component of the wavevector dependent direct correlation function @xmath103 ( in the inter molecular frame ) .",

    "note that @xmath108 contains the integration over the wave vector dependence .",
    "the slow down of the relaxation of single particle orientational correlation function is related to the nature of the component of the dynamics structure factor .",
    "it is important to note that the rotational friction depends on the rank of the orientational correlation function and this friction differs from rank to rank because of vastly different wave vector dependence of @xmath109 , for different @xmath110 , particularly at low wavenumbers . near the i - n transition , due to existence of large wave length fluctuations , the @xmath111 component of the @xmath112 undergoes a very slow decay and this is responsible for the slow down of the relaxation of the @xmath113 . in this limit",

    "note that the starting from density @xmath126=0.305 , the orientational pair correlation function becomes non - zero even at large intermolecular separations .",
    "this is reflected in the rapid growth of @xmath119 as @xmath127 near the i - n transition .",
    "combination of the above factors provides the following simple expression for the frequency dependence of the singular part of the memory kernel @xmath128 where a is a numerical constant @xcite .",
    "note that such a power law dependence is absent from all odd @xmath110-th @xmath129 but in principle present in all the even @xmath110 .",
    "however , as @xmath110 increases , the decay becomes increasingly inertial and the role of intermolecular correlation becomes weak beyond @xmath130 .",
    "but for @xmath131 and @xmath132 , the inverse square root dependence of the rotational memory function leads to a markedly slower , power law decay , as seen from figure 2(b ) .    physically , this power law is a manifestation of the growth of the pseudo - nematic domains near the i - n phase boundary .",
    "a particle inside this domain feels a localizing potential which makes its rotation difficult .",
    "however , even within such a domain , a rotation of an individual particle by 180(that is , by @xmath74 ) is possible because of the up - down symmetry of the particle .",
    "however , in contradiction to the conceptualization prevalent in supercooled liquid literature , here such a half - cycle rotation relaxes only the odd rank correlation functions , leaving the even ranked ones unchanged . in the mct description ,",
    "the influence of the localizing potential enters through the two particle direct correlation function ( @xmath133 ) and the static structure factor @xmath134 . just as in the maier - saupe theory",
