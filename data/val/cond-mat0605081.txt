    "there is a growing interest in solid state proposals for quantum computation , owing to their promise of a scalable technology given the connection with existing nano - fabrication techniques .",

    "single qubit control in the kane case is achieved by the application of gate potentials ( derived from surface electrodes ) , which shift the hyperfine interaction of a given target qubit in or out of resonance with a global transverse ac magnetic field .",
    "two - qubit operations are performed by drawing together the two donor - electron wave functions , such that the exchange interaction is modified @xcite .",
    "this requires the donors to be separated at distances of 20 - 30 nm .",
    "the standard paradigm for quantum computing requires the ability to individually control single qubits in a register of many qubits , as well as to implement controlled inter - qubit interactions .",
    "the proximity of neighbouring qubits results in poor localisation of gate potential , giving rise to a cross - talk effect on non - target qubits .",
    "this cross - talk in quantum control renders selective addressability for single qubit control problematic .",
    "a similar problem arises in other dopant based proposals @xcite , superconducting qubits and in quantum dots@xcite .",
    "analogous to this control problem , measurement cross - talk in such architectures may also be a problem ( similar to the squid equivalent @xcite ) .",
    "although both cross - talk and decoherence processes cause errors in qubit operations , we wish to distinguish the two .",
    "decoherence is a fundamentally non - unitary process caused by interaction with the environment , whereas cross - talk leads to unwanted unitary evolution of non - target qubits during an operation .",
    "given the stringent requirements of control precision that fault - tolerant quantum computation imposes at the 10@xmath1 level@xcite , determination and elimination of cross - talk is a key issue for scalable quantum computation .",

[ kane_arch ]",
    "this dependence and the inherent crosstalk has not received investigative attention so far .",
    "the couplings @xmath5 and @xmath6 depend on the donor electron wave function , which is determined by the solution of the electronic wave function hamiltonian .",
    "there have been a number of approaches to the calculation of the gate induced shift in the hyperfine coupling strength at various levels of sophistication of both electron wave functions and description of control field , including : perturbation theory with envelope hydrogenic wave function for circular and strip electrodes @xcite , envelope hydrogenic basis diagonalisation using numerically determined nano - gate potentials@xcite , variational effective mass theory in uniform fields@xcite , tight - binding calculations with uniform field @xcite , self - consistent calculation of 3d poisson and dft taking into account the six valleys of si band structure @xcite and numerical expansion in a basis of silicon bloch functions in a uniform field@xcite . despite differences in detail ,",
    "there is good agreement between these various methods on the hyperfine response to external electric fields .",
    "a hydrogenic approach has proven to be sufficient for the calculation of the hyperfine shift , whereas the details of the potential field generated by the control gate are vital to the description of the cross - talk problem .",
    "therefore , in this first determination of the extent of , and possible correction procedures for cross - talk in the quantum control problem , we adopt a hydrogenic envelope approximation for the donor electron wave function , but determine the electrostatic fields numerically to get a reliable description .    in this analysis",
    "we ignore the effects of the image charges of donor nuclei and electrons in the silicon - oxide barrier , as well as the effect of the magnetic fields on the electron wave functions .",

    "this will change the voltage at which it becomes energetically favourable to occupy these surface states for all donors , and will not produce a relative energy shift between the donors .",
    "we also ignore any inter - donor coupling , to include this would complicate the calculation considerably as it would be necessary to calculate the ground - state of a many electron system .",
    "we expect that inter - donor coupling will only play a role when the electron wavefunctions have been significantly deformed , and we are not interested in any regime in wich more than one donor electron wavefunction is distorted .",

    "the calculations are performed for a device temperature of 1k , where convergence is obtained by bootstrapping room temperature data carefully down to required temperature .",

    "single qubit operations are performed by controlling the donor nuclear - electron hyperfine coupling @xmath5 , via gate potentials .",
    "both @xmath5 , and the exchange coupling @xmath6 , depend on the wave functions of the donor - electrons .",

    "the hyperfine coupling between the nucleus and the electron depends on the overlap of their respective wave functions .",
    "the probability density of the nucleus is treated as a delta function , so the coupling strength @xmath5 is given by    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the permeability of silicon and @xmath43 is the donor electron wave function evaluated at the nucleus @xcite . due to complications arising from the core electrons of the donor ,",

    "the strength of the hyperfine coupling is also affected by donor depth , due to effects of both gate potential and oxide barrier . while the hyperfine coupling at donor depths @xmath47 12 nm from the oxide follow a regular pattern influenced by gate potential , very shallow depths show pronounced effects due to the oxide layer . at very shallow depths , we find that the hyperfine coupling initially increases with the applied positive bias before decreasing .",
    "this is due to the fact that when the donor is close to the oxide , the donor - electron at zero bias is pushed away from oxide , a positive bias restores @xmath5 to the normal value and then @xmath5 decreases as the wave function is pulled further towards the oxide .",
    "as the gate voltage is increased , we find that the electrons from all donors are perturbed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ e_response ] .",
    "it is found that for positive applied biases the electron wave functions of neighbouring donors are perturbed at lower voltages than the target qubit , while for negative biases the behaviour is more intuitive , with the target electron perturbed at a lower bias .",
    "this can be explained as follows ; the positive gate potential pulls the electron wave functions towards the oxide , while the oxide restricts the wave functions from entering it , forming a potential well at the silicon - oxide interface , underneath the gate .",
    "the depth of this potential well is the same for all donors , however donors nearer to the gate have the potential well of their ionic core lowered by the application of the field , more than for donors further from the gate .",
    "therefore , it becomes energetically favourable for the electrons of these distant donors donors to occupy this interface well at a lower potential than is the case for donors closer to the gate ( fig .",
    "[ pot_wells ] ) .",
    "it should be noted however , that the time scales on which these electrons tunnel into this interface well increases as the donors become further from the gate , as discussed in ref @xcite .",
    "therefore , it may be possible to use a kind of temporal selection whereby the gate pulses are timed such that they allow adiabatic evolution of the target donor electron into the interface well , but are too fast for the neighbouring donor electrons to tunnel .",
    "the design of such pulses with the requisite fidelity for quantum computation would be a formidable task , involving solution of he time - dependent schrdinger equation in a very large basis of states .",
    "here we restrict our attention to designing `` ground - state '' protocols , in which we assume that the pulses are applied in such a fashion that each donor electron is allowed to evolve adiabatically in its ground electronic state .    in the case of a negative applied potential ,",
    "the potential wells of the donor cores are raised in energy by the gate potential , the donors close to the gate are affected more by this than those further away , and so are perturbed at a lower gate bias . however ,",
    "this results in a very weakly bound donor electron state , which may be subject to significantly increased spin - orbit coupling , leading to increased dephasing rates . additionally , such weakly bound states are more susceptible to non - reversible ionisation .",
