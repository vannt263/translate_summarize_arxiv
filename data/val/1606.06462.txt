    "recent technological advances in the pursuit of building an adiabatic quantum computer @xcite have renewed the interest of the community in isolated , classical spin systems which are given a quantum dynamics by means of a transverse , uniform field . among these",
    ", spin glasses have received a lot of attention , mostly due to their connections with difficult ( np - complete ) computational problems @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report on the investigations of such transverse - field quantum spin glasses on a regular random graph , or bethe lattice , by focusing on the entanglement properties and correlation functions of the ground state .",
    "models of spin glasses with non - commuting terms ( _ quantum spin glasses _ for short ) are not new in the literature and have been analyzed on several geometries to various degrees of details and , although no exact solution exists , a lot is known @xcite including connections with quantum complexity theory @xcite .    as it seems to be the rule in these problems , the geometry in which one can expect to do more progress is the fully - connected graph analog to the sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite , which however has a limited concept of locality , since any couple of spins is at minimum distance .",
    "the second in line are spin models on the bethe lattice where the hamiltonian is local and some kind of iteration procedure can be used to solve them @xcite .",
    "some of the concepts developed in the replica theory of spin glasses , chiefly , the replica symmetry breaking cavity method of ref . @xcite have been generalized to transverse field ising spin glasses @xcite , quantum ferromagnets @xcite , and combinatorial optimization problems @xcite , allowing one to see certain features of the transition from the paramagnetic to the spin - glass phase which occurs when the transverse - field intensity is reduced , directly in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however this quantum generalization of the cavity method has not yet turned into a useful tool to study purely quantum aspects of the phases , like the entanglement entropy .",
    "another reason that motivates our research , which only at first sight might seem detached from the previous discussion , are the recent developments in the theory of disordered , isolated quantum systems , in particular the study of their unitary dynamics ( as opposed to the partition function ) , which comes under the umbrella of many - body localization ( mbl ) @xcite .",
    "this body of work suggests that for disordered quantum systems a phase of non - ergodic @xcite or even integrable dynamics @xcite exists which prevents a statistical mechanics description of the equilibrium properties of the system . this phenomenon has been pointed out as a possible bottleneck for the adiabatic algorithm @xcite solving a classically difficult problem , but these claims have been criticized and are currently under investigation @xcite .",
    "the issue , in brief , is that small gaps are natural in a many - body phase due to the above - mentioned emergent integrability .",
    "however , a quantitative analysis of this smallness is based on numerical investigations and is still incomplete ; a general theoretical framework is still missing .",
    "therefore one is naturally lead to ask whether there is an mbl phase inside the glassy phase or , perchance , it spans the entire glassy phase ( a similar observation has been made in @xcite ) .",
    "an mbl phase is a region of parameter space in which the langevin forces disappear at a _ microscopic _ level due to quantum fluctuations , inhibiting transport of all conserved quantities ( but not the development of entanglement among far away spins @xcite ) ; in a spin glass phase langevin forces still exists , as it is testified by the system equilibrating in a ( local ) minimum of the free energy , although ( in particular in high - dimensional lattices like our rrg ) such forces might not be sufficiently strong to overcome the barriers that are formed in between local minima and ergodicity is broken at a _ macroscopic _ level .",
    "therefore there is no logical reason why the two transitions should coincide .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to identify and characterize the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) from the paramagnetic to the glassy phase .",
    "we use exact diagonalization and quantum monte carlo algorithms to study large system sizes .",
    "we locate the critical point of the transition with high precision using the position of the peak of the rnyi-2 entanglement entropy and the emergence of finite values for the edwards ",
    "anderson order parameter , finding identical results .",
    "we see that the critical correlation lengths converge to a finite value in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the analysis of the quantum fisher information , which is found to be nonextensive , suggests that multipartite entanglement never diverges but is limited to pairs of spins for any system size .",
    "we also give some indications that at the quantum spin glass transition there is no sign of many - body localization by presenting a mean - field picture of the transition in which delocalized quantum excitations are present and showing that it gives a reasonable prediction of the transition point and of the observed properties of the ground state wave function .",
    "the picture that emerges is that this transition does not bear any sign of mbl and therefore we conjecture that , if mbl exists in this model , it will be inside the glassy phase . we will comment on the implications of this result for present attempts to adiabatic quantum computation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sect : introduction ] we review the known results for both the classical and quantum transition , as well as the motivations that underlie this work ; in section [ sect : numerical ] we describe the numerical methods we employ and we present the results for the order parameter , the connected correlation functions , the quantum fisher information and the rnyi entanglement entropy of the ground state ; in section [ sect : mean_field ] we present a mean - field theory which explains the above observations ; we present the conclusions and open directions for further work in section [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "we study the model of a spin glass on a regular random graph ( rrg ) with @xmath0 vertices , with transverse field : @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( for @xmath3 ) is a pauli matrix acting on the @xmath4-th spin of the system . the couplings @xmath5 with probability @xmath6 and the rrg has fixed connectivity @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is then called the branching number of the associated bethe lattice . for convenience",
    "we take @xmath9 in the rest of the paper , in particular in the numerical treatments , since this allows us to have systems of larger `` linear dimension '' , the diameter of the rrg @xmath10 .",
    "is the unique @xmath11-regular tree on an infinite number of nodes , depicted above for @xmath12 .",
    "starting from any point in the graph , the @xmath13-th `` shell '' around the point has @xmath14 elements , which means that in the truncated tree only a fraction @xmath15 of the spins belongs in the bulk . in order to avoid dealing with the boundary",
    ", we will think of the bethe lattice as the local large size limit of random regular graphs . ]",
    "we consider the partition function of the system ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17 assuming the dynamics is ergodic .",
    "this is almost certainly true if the system is coupled to a bath ( which is the situation we consider here ) but it is also probably true for an isolated system in a large region of parameters , including the paramagnetic region , although a complete analysis of this problem would require an analysis on the line of refs @xcite .",
    "in particular we assume that taking the limit @xmath18 the region of parameters investigated is within the ergodic region ( this is one of the reasons we do not push our analysis deep in the spin glass phase ) .",
    "the transition at @xmath19 can be called the _ classical _ transition as it is due solely to the langevin forces generated by the interaction with the bath .",
    "this transitions is supposed to determine the characteristics of the whole line extending up to , but not including , @xmath20 . this can be understood as , upon suzuki ",
    "trotter , the system can be given a transverse dimension of size @xmath16 , or more precisely @xmath21 .",
    "when one is close to the transition such that the critical system size exceeds this length the system can be `` renormalized '' back to the original rrg .",
    "this can not be done when @xmath20 .",
    "we now discuss the classical transition , which has been studied extensively in the literature , and the known computational complexity considerations for the model at hand .",
    "so we are presented with a phase diagram in the @xmath22-plane , where the classical spin glass transition ( @xmath19 ) occurs at @xmath23 while the location of the quantum spin glass transition @xmath24 at @xmath20 is not known analytically and a convex line joins these two points .    for @xmath9",
    "this is ( setting the units of energy such that @xmath25 ) @xmath26 or @xmath27 , and @xmath24 between @xmath28 and @xmath29 from the analysis of ref.@xcite .",
    "it is also important to notice that for large @xmath8 , @xmath30 we will see that a mean field theory for the quantum fluctuations at @xmath20 also predicts @xmath31 which means that @xmath32 need to be scaled with @xmath33 for large @xmath8 although the origin of the two scalings is apparently quite different .",
    "it is convenient now to review some known properties of the classical transition .",
    "first of all , we recall that the system can be solved numerically , directly in the thermodynamic limit , to arbitrary degrees of accuracy with the cavity method of @xcite .",
    "this method introduces the cavity fields @xmath34 which are the effective fields acting on a given spin , once one of the @xmath7-th link has been removed .",
    "it is possible to find a recursion equation for the cavity fields of the spin 0 once those of the spins @xmath35 are known @xmath36 these fields are random i.i.d .",
    "( since the correlations are negligible for large system sizes ) and distributed according to a probability distribution which is stable under ( [ eq : cavityeq ] ) . the distribution which is stable under iterations in the paramagnetic phase is @xmath37 and the limit of stability of this solution is observed by expanding eq .",
    "( [ eq : cavityeq ] ) for small @xmath34 @xmath38 by squaring and taking the average both over @xmath39 and over @xmath40 we can see how the size of the distribution ( as measured by @xmath41 , given that @xmath42 ) evolves under the iterations .",
    "we get @xmath43 which means that until @xmath44 given by ( [ eq : tcsg ] ) the stable distribution has a decreasing @xmath41 until @xmath45 , from which we obtain ( [ eq : ppara ] ) @xcite . proceeding with this reasoning one",
    "can also find that for @xmath46 : @xmath47    another instructive way to obtain the same results is to consider the spin - spin connected correlation function @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a local field applied on the spin @xmath50 ( and then sent to zero ) @xmath51 . by using a telescopic identity and the recursion relations on the field , for @xmath52 we have @xmath53",
    "now @xmath54 since we are studying the stability of the paramagnetic phase and the critical region we can set @xmath55 , which gives @xmath56 considering that at a distance @xmath57 , diameter of the rrg , there are @xmath58 paths that lead from one spin to another , we have that the susceptibility on a single path has to be summed over all the @xmath58 paths @xmath59 @xmath60 since this is a sum of randomly signed , i.i.d .",
    "terms , we have that the typical value is @xmath61 this decays exponentially if and only if @xmath44 in ( [ eq : tcsg ] ) .",
    "notice that this sum is not dominated by a single term , but it is a collective behavior of the single terms which gives rise to the transition .",
    "this correlation function can be used to define the _ shattered susceptibility _",
    "@xmath62 which diverges at the transition and remains infinite in the whole sg phase , below the at line @xcite . on the bethe lattice",
    "this is due to the fact that the exponential growth of the number of sites at distance @xmath13 , @xmath63 , dominates over the exponential decay of the typical spin - spin correlation .    after mapping this to a directed polymer problem @xcite",
    ", one would find that the directed polymer is in the self - averaging phase ( see also @xcite )",
    ". for comparison , the anderson model on the bethe lattice seems always to be in a non - self - averaging ( or glassy ) phase @xcite .    in some sense",
    "that will be made clear in the following , for zero temperature the spin - spin correlation can be seen as the propagator of an excitation on the ground state ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : propagator ] ) @xmath64 we will see in section [ sect : mean_field ] that deep in the paramagnetic phase @xmath65 we can consider @xmath66 as the operator creating the excitation : @xmath67 . for finite @xmath68 the excitations are dressed but there is still an amplitude of creating an excitation applying @xmath69 on @xmath70 .      from a computational perspective , the model ( [ eq : tfisg ] ) is interesting because finding or approximating its ground state energy even at @xmath71 is a hard optimization problem . for comparison ,",
    "finding the ground state energy of the same ising spin glass hamiltonian defined on planar or toroidal graphs at @xmath71 is a problem that can be solved exactly in polynomial time @xcite ( _ i.e. _ easily ) and even when exact solutions are unknown or unlikely to exist one can usually find some approximating algorithm that gives a solution close to the exact one .",
    "for example , an @xmath0-vertex cubic lattice in three dimensions is @xmath72-approximable for any @xmath73 . in a nutshell",
    ", one can partition the lattice into small cubes of size @xmath74 and define a new hamiltonian @xmath75 by discarding from @xmath76 the interaction terms that cross from one cube into another .",
    "then @xmath75 is a sum of terms defined on different , non - interacting regions of the system and one can solve each term separately , even by brute force ( e.g. checking the energy of each possible configuration and taking one with minimal energy ) .",
    "this takes linear time since there are @xmath77 cubes and each one requires @xmath78 steps which is a constant in @xmath0 .",
    "finally one gives the ground - state energy of @xmath75 as the approximation of the ground - state energy of the original hamiltonian @xmath76 .",
    "the number of bonds discarder by the approximation is given by    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the number of small cubes and @xmath81 is the number of bonds across the boundary of a single cube .",
    "since @xmath82 for all bonds @xmath83 then the absolute error of the estimated ground - state energy is upper bounded by @xmath84 and one can then choose a large enough @xmath85 so that the @xmath77 prefactor is as small as desired .",
    "the success of this approximation is based on the fact that surface effects can be neglected since these grow like @xmath86 while volume effects grow like @xmath87 . however , this condition is not satisfied in the case of a low - degree regular random graph because rrgs are ( on average ) good _ _ expander graphs__@xcite .",
    "roughly speaking ,",
    "expanders are sparse graphs where , for almost all regions , the boundary of the region ( _ i.e. _ the number of edges connecting the region to the rest of the graph ) is proportional to its volume ( the number of vertices inside of the region ) .",
    "physical systems whose interaction graphs are expanders have boundary effects that can not be neglected . in the cubic lattice example , if we had that @xmath88 then we would get an absolute error which is independent of @xmath85 and therefore the previous approximation scheme can not be fine - tuned to achieve any desired error .      as a further point of interest",
    ", the ground state of ( [ eq : tfisg ] ) is expected to be highly entangled somewhere along the @xmath20 line .",
    "this is because the topological properties of the interaction structure of a local hamiltonian such as ( [ eq : tfisg ] ) are known to affect the entanglement of its ground state .",
    "as very rough way of estimating the entanglement entropy of a region @xmath89 , valid at least for the ground states of gapped hamiltonians , is to assign a fixed contribution to each interaction that cross from @xmath89 into the rest of the system .",
    "this implies that if many regions of the system are sparsely interacting with the rest of the system ( _ i.e. _ if the spins inside of the region interact with only a few spins on the outside ) then the entanglement will be comparatively low on average . on the other hand , if each spin participates in too many interactions then the entanglement in the ground state is suppressed as well , as the monogamy of entanglement prevents spins from being highly entangled with a large number of other spins .",
    "a hamiltonian defined on an expander graph ( such as a low - degree regular random graph ) seems to lie halfway between these two extremal cases as these graphs are sparse but at the same time almost every subregion is highly - connected with the rest of the graph , and is therefore expected to be highly entangled .",
    "the presence of large entanglement in the ground state makes this model a particularly hard test for the physical implementations of adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) , a model of quantum computation where the goal is finding the ground state of a `` problem hamiltonian '' @xmath90 whose ( unknown ) ground state encodes the solution to some optimization problem .",
    "the computation starts in a quantum system with an unrelated hamiltonian @xmath91 that has an easy - to - prepare ground state .",
    "the hamiltonian is then changed continuously in time so as to transform @xmath91 into @xmath90 after a finite time .",
    "if the adiabaticity condition is satisfied then the system , starting in the ground state of @xmath91 , will remain in the istantaneous ground state of the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath92 at all times @xmath93 , and will end up in the ground state of the problem hamiltonian @xmath90 .",
    "aqc has recently attracted attention when the d - wave company announced the developement of a `` quantum annealer '' , a quantum computational device that performs a finite - temperature version of the adiabatic algorithm where the transverse field parameter @xmath68 in an transverse - field ising spin glass hamiltonian similar to ( [ eq : tfisg ] ) starts at @xmath94 and is then decreased linearly to zero . while the theoretical description of the adiabatic algorithm assumes that coherence is mantained throughout its entire run , practical implementations such as the d - wave machine have much shorter decoherence times @xcite .",
    "this might be problematic , as it was recently shown numerically @xcite that entanglement seems to positively correlate with better performances ( _ i.e. _ better approximations to the ground state energy ) .",
    "entanglement is also known to play a role in the theory of quantum computational complexity : volume - law entanglement scaling was observed to be associated with the _ exponential _ speedup that quantum computers are expected to have over classical computers at performing certain specific computational tasks @xcite . on the contrary , it is known that efficient quantum algorithms that generate an entanglement that grows slowly with the system size ( as measured _ e.g. _ by the schmidt rank @xcite or the maximum number of entangled qubits @xcite ) can achieve at most a polynomial speedup over their classical counterparts .    since decoherence is one of the main obstacles to building a fault - tolerant quantum computer , we believe that having a quantitative study of the theoretical amount of entanglement that is generated in an adiabatic path will provide a useful way of knowing the degree to which a quantum computer is performing a fully coherent adiabatic quantum algorithm .",
    "consequently , one of the goal of this work is to study the entanglement dynamics of an _ ideal _ quantum annealing protocol , _",
    "i.e. _ an actually adiabatic path where the transverse - field coupling constant @xmath68 starts at a large value and is then quasi - statically decreased , in order to provide a benchmark for prospective in - depth studies of the entanglement dynamics of a real - life quantum annealer such as the d - wave machine .",
    "we numerically compute the rnyi-2 entropy , quantum fisher information , edwards  anderson order parameter and two - point correlation functions using exact diagonalization for small system sizes @xmath95 , and mc simulations for large systems sizes ( up to @xmath96 ) .",
    "this allows us to obtain information about the thermodynamic - limit properties via finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "systems of small size ( @xmath97 ) are amenable to exact diagonalization ( ed ) methods , which means that the spectrum of the reduced density matrix is fully accessible .",
    "we use the lanczos algorithm to extract the ground state of @xmath76 .",
    "this step constitutes the bottleneck of the whole procedure , as the hamiltonian matrix is @xmath98 ( albeit sparse ) , which effectively constrains the system size not to exceed @xmath99 by too much .",
    "the reduced density matrix of half of the system , on the other hand , is only @xmath100 , making it much easier to probe its full spectrum . in this way",
    "one can compute the rnyi entropy of any desired order @xmath101 , which in the thermal case is defined as ( notice that the von neumann entropy corresponds to the formal limit @xmath102 ) : @xmath103 } { 1-\\alpha},\\ ] ] where @xmath104 is the ( normalized ) reduced density matrix of a subsystem labeled @xmath89 ( an example could be @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the size of the subsystem ) obtained by tracing out only the degrees of freedom in the complement subsystem ( labeled @xmath107 ) , and @xmath108 is the basis set with the spin degrees of freedom @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( corresponding to the complementary regions @xmath89 and @xmath107 , respectively ) separately indicated .",
    "the rnyi entropy of the ground state is obtained by taking the limit @xmath111 .",
    "another quantity we can probe via exact diagonalization is the ground - state direction - averaged quantum fisher information ( qfi ) relative to the total spin operator , namely @xmath112 \\equiv \\frac{f[\\psi_0 ; j_x ] + f[\\psi_0 ; j_y ] + f[\\psi_0 ; j_z]}{3},\\ ] ] where , for @xmath113 @xmath114 for a pure state @xmath115 it holds that @xmath116 = 4\\big ( { \\langle\\psi|}j_aj_a{|\\psi\\rangle } - { \\langle\\psi|}j_a{|\\psi\\rangle}^2\\big ) = 4 \\var(j_a)\\ ] ] so knowledge of the ground state @xmath117 is sufficient for computing @xmath118 $ ] .    where exact diagonalization stops being feasible ( system sizes @xmath119 ) one can compute thermal quantities numerically using the path - integral quantum monte carlo ( pimc ) approach . in pimc one",

    ". then @xmath132 .",
    "expected values of quantum observables @xmath133 can then be computed in a straightforward manner by applying this quantum - to - classical map to the expression    @xmath134 and then using standard monte carlo sampling on the resulting classical system .",
    "ground - state properties are accessible in the limit @xmath111 .",
    "we use this standard pimc approach when computing the edwards ",
    "anderson order parameter ( [ eq : eaop ] ) and the spatial correlation functions ( [ eq : correlation_function ] ) .",
    "however , one must take a somewhat different approach when computing entanglement entropies .",
    "rnyi entropies are _ not _ observables of the system ( trivially , they are not linear operators ) hence a naive pimc is inapplicable . in order to compute the rnyi-@xmath135 entanglement entropy of a region @xmath89 of the system we use the replica - approach algorithm described in @xcite that allows for computations of nonlinear quantities .    when computing the rnyi-2 entropy using the monte carlo approach described before we set an inverse temperature of @xmath136 in order to project the thermal state to the ground state and we use @xmath137 timeslices for each replica so that the imaginary time discretization is given by @xmath138 .",
    "we also add a weak longitudinal field term @xmath139 with @xmath140 to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : tfisg ] ) since we noticed that it shortens the monte carlo convergence times . the ( small ) effect that this field has on the rnyi entropy values is expained in subsection [ subsect : results ] . in order to assign an error bar to the result for each disorder realization we performed ten independent simulations starting from a different initial configuration ( the same for all replicas ) . in this case , the value of @xmath141 for each realization of disorder is obtained by averaging over the ten results .",

    "we emphasize that our analysis focuses on the regime of large and intermediate values of @xmath144 where @xmath8 is the connectivity of the rrg . here , for the finite system size we consider , the problems due to the slowdown of the monte carlo dynamics in the glassy phase are not overwhelming .",
    "more details on all these techniques are contained in the appendix .",

    "this is @xmath278 and after rewriting the denominators as integrals over time we define @xmath279 is the position ket of an excitation at @xmath50 .",
    "notice that , to lowest order in @xmath257 , @xmath280 is exactly the single @xmath196-spin flipped state @xmath281 we introduced before .",

    "so at the transition the picture is that of a finite density of particles which interact and annihilate in couples ( like anyons ) and whose gain in energy due to delocalization makes the vacuum state unstable .",
    "as the single particle eigenstates are all delocalized , the only possible source of localization could come from a large susceptibility of the many - body system to disorder , like hypothesized in @xcite ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "this point is worth investigating and we will address it in future work , where we anticipate that different numerical techniques will be needed as qmc numerics is not suited to answer this kind of questions .",

    "so , both the extensivity of the rnyi entropy and the correction to @xmath24 point in the direction of a finite density of excitations in the ground state .    summarizing this section , and refraining from doing numerology ,",
    "there is a lesson to be learned from a mean - field theory of excitations on the @xmath196-polarized ground state .",
    "first of all , the starting point @xmath224 seems a good one , both qualitatively and quantitatively , in particular at large @xmath8 .",
    "it is very instructive , in order to build an intuition of this glass transition , to consider this phenomenology complementary to the one obtained by starting from the classical @xmath296-spin glass at @xmath19 and the dressing it with excitations .",
    "then again , it seems that looking at different particle numbers sector @xmath247 we get a better approximation going up with @xmath247 so the transition occurs when a highly occupied state comes close to the ground state , which has only  virtual \" particles .",
    "this points in a direction which is completely different from that advocated in previous studies .",
    "the phase transition is dominated by quantum processes and probably has little signature of the complexity of the classical problem .",
    "since it is reasonable to expect that the latter has to manifest itself at some point during the adiabatic evolution , it is conceivable that an inner region of the glassy phase is characterized by another phase transition .",
    "a natural candidate would be an mbl region , which is typically affected by exponentially small gaps , which would therefore be encountered by the adiabatic algorithm before the classical point .",
    "this interesting research direction calls for further work .",
    "we studied the @xmath297 line of the @xmath22-phase diagram of a transverse - field ising spin glass defined on a regular random graph of connectivity @xmath9 , where the system is known to enter a glassy phase at small values of @xmath68 .",
    "we computed numerically the disorder - averaged rnyi entropy @xmath153 when the region @xmath89 is taken to be half of the system .",
    "we focused on the paramagnetic phase up to the critical point .",
    "we found that the rnyi entanglement entropy satisfies a volume law for all values of the transverse field @xmath68 we considered , with a prefactor that is maximal at a point we interpret as the critical point of a qpt .",
    "we see that this point coincides within statistical errors with the critical point of the glassy phase transition of the model , which we found by studying the edwards  anderson parameter @xmath193 .",
    "we also saw that @xmath193 is continuous at this critical point .",
    "we studied the disorder - averaged values of two ( spatial ) two - point correlation functions of the model  the maximal correlation and the mean correlation  in order to get a better understanding of this phase transition .",
    "the decay of both of these correlation functions was found to be compatible with a stretched - exponential for all values of @xmath68 , both critical and off - critical .",
    "we extracted critical correlation lengths @xmath298 and observed that they decrease with the system size @xmath0 and converge to a finite value at the critical point of the glassy transition .",
    "we conclude that this phase transition exhibits features of both first - order transitions ( finite critical correlation length ) and second - order ones ( continuous order parameter ) . from all the above - mentioned quantities we extracted the following estimate for the critical point : @xmath222 .",
    "small - size numerical studies of the quantum fisher information point to the fact that critical and off - critical multipartite entanglement are microscopic , _",
    "i.e. _ they never involve more than a number of spins that is constant in the system size .",
    "this might _ prima facie _ seem to contrast with the volume - law of the rnyi entropy but we believe that the following simple picture of the wavefunction to be compatible with all the data . at @xmath299 the wavefunction is a product state of @xmath300 eigenstates .",
    "as @xmath68 is decreased , pairs of nearest - neighbours entangled spins are created and become increasingly entangled as @xmath68 approaches the critical point of the qpt .",
    "the volume - law scaling of the rnyi entropy is a consequence of the expander - graph structure of the interaction graph of the model : any bipartition @xmath89 cuts through an extensive number of these @xmath135-spin entangled states , each of which gives a finite contribution to the entanglement entropy @xmath141 .    in order to further explain these results we attempted a perturbative calculation using the large-@xmath68 transverse - field term as the unperturbed hamiltonian and the spin - glass coupling strength @xmath39 as the perturbative parameter .",
    "the spectrum of the unperturbed hamiltonian can be interpreted as a vacuum of quasiparticles , on top of which there are equally - spaced bands of increasing quasiparticle density .",
    "first - order parturbation theory in @xmath39 showed that the energy of the first excited state ( belonging to the one - particle band ) crosses the ground state energy at @xmath301 .",
    "going to higher bands and using a mean - field hamiltonian that reproduces some of the contributions of higher - order perturbation terms we see that the critical points moves to higher values of @xmath68 .",
    "the idea is then that at the critical point one of the higher bands crosses the vacuum energy of the quasiparticles , so that energy considerations favour the creation of a finite density of quasiparticles .",
    "this perturbative approach is also corroborated by the fact that its predictions are consistent with the known results for the limit @xmath302 of infinite connectivity , where the rrg ising spin glass goes to the sherrington - kirkpatrick model .    from the point of view of quantum computation",
    "we note that the microscopicity of the entanglement , along with the fact that exponentially - closing avoided crossings in the paramagnetic region are highly unlikely , suggest on the one hand that quantum annealers do not need to generate and sustain an inordinate amount of entanglement in order to correctly follow the adiabatic path , at least up to the critical point of the transition . on the other hand",
    ", this part of the adiabatic - evolution dynamics can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer using the standard methods of refs @xcite .",
    "the extension of these considerations to the entire adiabatic path rests upon the scaling behaviour of the multipartite entanglement and the minimal gap inside of the glassy phase .",
    "previous results on the related problem @xmath186-regular max - cut ( which is equivalent to our model without disordered interactions @xmath146 ) found that the gap closes superpolynomially fast inside of the glassy phase .",
    "we expect this to be the same also in the ising spin glass . also , classical considerations suggest that at least for @xmath71 we should have ground states that are superpositions of ( quantum states that represent ) the solutions to the classical problem , _",
    "i.e. _ the classical ising spin glass .",
    "these quantum states are expected to be products of smaller entangled and unentangled states .",
    "for example , if `` 000101 '' and `` 000011 '' are the only two solutions to the classical problem , then their superposition can be written as @xmath303 that is , a six - qubit state that is only @xmath135-entangled .",
    "therefore entanglement is dependent on the structure of the solutions to the classical problem , for which at the moment we do not have a clear picture .",
    "we believe there are several future directions that might be worth exploring . the obvious one is to extend our study of the rnyi entropy inside of the glassy phase , where ergodicity breaking manifests itself as a fast increase of the convergence time needed by the monte carlo simulations .",
    "methods such as parallel tempering have been used to ameliorate this effect so it is reasonable to believe that this obstacle is not an insurmountable one .",
    "secondly , a better understanding of the entanglement in the ground - state wavefunctions of the quantum adiabatic algorithm seems auspicable .",
    "in particular , when does an adiabatic path encounters points of macroscopic entanglement , and how does this feature relate with the minimal gap ?",
    "still another possible direction is to study the rnyi entropy dynamics in the adiabatic path of a realistic combinatorial problem . following",
    "the literature , the average entanglement properties of @xmath304-sat or exact cover in a transverse field might be interesting points .",
    "finally , a more systematic study of the mean - field approach and of the developement of quasiparticle descriptions of the physics of adiabatic paths seem useful in order to develop a better intuition .",
