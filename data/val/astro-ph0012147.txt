    "the idea of interstellar silicate grains can be traced back to the 1960 s when kamijo ( 1963 ) first proposed that sio@xmath3 , condensed in the atmospheres of cool stars and blown out into the interstellar space , could provide condensation cores for the formation of `` dirty ices '' .",
    "it was later shown by gilman ( 1969 ) that grains around oxygen - rich cool giants are mainly silicates such as al@xmath3sio@xmath4 and mg@xmath3sio@xmath5 .",
    "silicates were first detected in emission in m stars ( woolf & ney 1969 ; knacke et al .  1969 ) , in the trapezium region of the orion nebula ( stein & gillett 1969 ) , and in comet bennett 1969i ( maas , ney , & woolf 1970 ) ; in absorption toward the galactic center ( hackwell , gehrz , & woolf 1970 ) , and toward the becklin - neugebauer object and kleinmann - low nebula ( gillett & forrest 1973 ) .",
    "silicates are now known to be ubiquitous , seen in interstellar clouds , circumstellar disks around young stellar objects ( ysos ) , main - sequence stars and evolved stars , in hii regions , and in interplanetary and cometary dust .",
    "the observed broad , featureless profile of the 10@xmath0 m si - o stretching mode indicated that interstellar silicates are predominantly amorphous . with the advent of _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) and the improved ground - based spectrometers , the presence of crystalline silicates has been revealed in six comets ( see hanner 1999 for a summary ) , in dust disks around main - sequence stars ( see artymowicz 2000 for a summary ) , ysos , and evolved stars ( see waelkens , malfait , & waters 2000 for a summary ) , in interplanetary dust particles ( idps ) ( bradley et al .",
    "1999 ) , and probably also in the orion nebula ( cesarsky et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "if silicate grains with radii @xmath1  which we will refer to as `` ultrasmall ''  are present , single - photon heating by starlight ( greenberg 1968 ) will cause these grains to radiate in the 10@xmath6 feature ( see , e.g. , draine & anderson 1985 ) . the absence of a 10@xmath6 emission feature in iras spectra led dsert et al .",
    "( 1986 ) to conclude that not more than 1% of si could be in @xmath7 silicate grains , and on this basis recent grain models ( duley , jones , & williams 1989 ; dsert , boulanger , & puget 1990 ; siebenmorgen & krgel 1992 ; mathis 1996 ; li & greenberg 1997 ; dwek et al .  1997",
    "; weingartner & draine 2001 ; li & draine 2001 ) have excluded ultrasmall silicate grains as a significant grain component .",
    "nondetection of the 10@xmath0 m silicate emission feature in the diffuse ism by iso ( mattila et al .",
    "1996 ) and the _ infrared telescope in space _ ( irts ) ( onaka et al .",
    "1996 ) appeared to confirm this conclusion .",
    "however , the presence of ultrasmall silicate grains can not be ruled out since the 10@xmath0 m silicate emission feature may be hidden by the dominant pah features . in this _",
    "letter _ we place quantitative upper limits on the abundances of both amorphous and crystalline ultrasmall silicate grains by calculating spectra for such tiny grains heated by starlight , and comparing to measurements of the infrared ( ir ) _ emission _ of the diffuse ism by irts ( onaka et al .",
    "1996 ) and by the _ diffuse infrared background experiment _ ( dirbe ) instrument on the _ cosmic background explorer _ ( cobe ) satellite . the interstellar extinction curve and the 10@xmath0 m silicate _ absorption _ profile",
    "are also invoked to provide further constraints .    in  [ sec : opct_si ] we discuss the optical and thermal properties of crystalline silicate material . in ",
    "[ sec : upplimt ] we calculate the ir emission spectra of ultrasmall silicate grains and deduce upper limits on their abundances based on the constraints provided by the observed ir emission spectrum (  [ sec : upplimt_emsn ] ) , by the interstellar extinction curve (  [ sec : upplimt_ext ] ) , and by the 10@xmath0 m silicate absorption profile (  [ sec : upplimt_silabs ] ) . in  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the effects of dust size distributions and the sources of uncertainty .",
    " [ sec : summary ] summarizes our main conclusions .",
    "we approximate the grains as spherical and use mie theory to calculate their absorption and scattering properties . the complex refractive index @xmath8 of amorphous silicates is taken from draine & lee ( 1984 ) .    for crystalline silicates ,",
    "we proceed as follows : for @xmath9 m , we take @xmath10 from huffman & stapp ( 1973 ) for crystalline olivine ( mg , fe)@xmath3sio@xmath5 ; for @xmath11 , we take @xmath10 from `` astronomical silicate '' ( draine & lee 1984 ) ; for @xmath12 , we take @xmath10 from mukai & koike ( 1990 ) for crystalline olivine mg@xmath13fe@xmath14sio@xmath15 ; for @xmath16 m , we assume @xmath17 . the real part @xmath18 is obtained from @xmath19 using the kramers - kronig relation .",
    "the specific heat of amorphous silicates is taken from draine & li ( 2001 ) . for crystalline silicates , following draine & li ( 2001 )",
    ", we adopt a three - dimensional debye model with @xmath20k which closely reproduces the specific heat of crystalline mg@xmath3sio@xmath5 measured by robie , hemingway , & takei ( 1982 ) .",
    "we will now derive upper limits on the abundances of ultrasmall silicate grains in the diffuse ism based on comparison of the _ observed _ ir emission spectrum with the _ calculated _ emission spectrum of ultrasmall silicate grains .",
    "for this purpose , we require a line - of - sight with : 1 ) a good quality mid - ir emission spectrum ; and estimates of 2 ) the starlight intensity @xmath21 ( relative to the mathis , mezger , & panagia [ 1983 ] radiation field ) , and 3 ) the hydrogen column density @xmath22 .",
    "the diffuse ism toward @xmath23 , @xmath24 has been observed by dirbe ( hauser et al .",
    "1998 ) and the mid - infrared spectrograph ( mirs ) on irts ( onaka et al .",
    "1996 ) has obtained the 4.711.7@xmath0 m spectrum .",
    "li & draine ( 2001 ) have modelled the ir emission from the dust in this direction . in figure",
    "[ fig : mirmodel ] we show the observed photometry and mid - ir spectrum together with the li & draine ( 2001 ) model , with a total gas column @xmath25 , and a mixture of carbonaceous grains and silicate grains heated by starlight with @xmath26 .",
    "this model is seen to be in good agreement with the pah emission features seen by irts , as well as the dirbe photometry .",
    "the total power radiated constrains the product @xmath27 , while the @xmath2100@xmath6 wavelength of peak emission constrains @xmath21 .",
    "lacking _ a priori _ expectations concerning the form of the size distribution for ultrasmall silicate grains , we first consider grains of a single size @xmath28 ( radius of an equal - volume sphere ) .",
    "suppose a fraction @xmath29 of the total silicon abundance ( si / h @xmath30 ; grevesse & sauval 1998 ) is contained in amorphous silicate grains of radius @xmath28 .",
    "applying the _ thermal - discrete _ method developed in draine & li ( 2001 ) , we calculate the energy probability distribution function and the resulting ir emission spectrum .",
    "the resulting emission spectra are shown in figure [ fig : emsn_acsi ] , where for each size @xmath28 the value of @xmath31 has been chosen such that this abundance of ultrasmall amorphous silicate grains would not  by itself  exceed the observed emission at any wavelength .",
    "grains with @xmath32 are heated by energetic photons to `` temperatures '' high enough to emit in the 10@xmath6 silicate feature , and their abundances are thus limited by the irts spectrum . for grains with @xmath33 the emission peak shifts to longer wavelength , and",
    "the dirbe 25@xmath6 data provides stronger constraints .    from figure",
    "[ fig : emsn_acsi]a it can be seen that , for @xmath34 , even if a fraction @xmath35 were in the form of amorphous silicates , the resulting 10@xmath0 m si - o emission feature would not have been apparent in the irts spectrum . for @xmath36 ,",
    "@xmath37 is permitted . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the dirbe 25@xmath6 photometry allows up to @xmath39 , and for @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , we can estimate @xmath29 for ultrasmall crystalline silicate grains .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : emsn_acsi]b , crystalline mg@xmath13fe@xmath14sio@xmath15 has pronounced features at 10.0 , 11.1 , 16.3 , 18.6 , 23.0 and 33.6@xmath0 m . for @xmath34 ,",
    "nondetection of the 10.0@xmath6 feature implies @xmath42 . for @xmath43 , an upper limit @xmath44 is imposed by the dirbe 25@xmath0 m data , and for @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "interstellar crystalline silicates could presumably differ from the crystalline olivine mg@xmath13fe@xmath14sio@xmath15 considered here , resulting in changes in the strengths and positions of the infrared resonances ( e.g. , see jger et al .",
    "1998 for different crystalline silicate samples ) .",
    "observations of comet hale - bopp ( see hanner 1999 ) showed an emission feature at 11.2 rather than 11.1@xmath6 , and an emission feature at @xmath47 , evident in some spectra , was not always apparent .",
    "our limits on @xmath34 crystalline silicates relied on the strength and position of the 10.0@xmath6 feature ; since this feature in interstellar crystalline silicates might be either weaker or shifted in wavelength , it is appropriate to weaken our upper limits for @xmath34 to @xmath48 .",
    "below we will find that the 10@xmath6 absorption profile provides a more restrictive limit on crystalline silicates .",
    "ultrasmall silicate grains make a steeply - rising contribution to the ultraviolet ( uv ) extinction .",
    "weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) and li & draine ( 2001 ) have obtained a carbonaceous - silicate grain model which reproduces both the observed extinction and the observed infrared emission .",
    "this grain model has only a small abundance @xmath49 of ultrasmall ( @xmath50 ) silicate grains . in figure",
    "[ fig : ext_uv ] we show the extinction obtained by _ adding _ ultrasmall silicate grains to this model .",
    "since the ultrasmall grains are in the rayleigh limit , the added extinction depends only on @xmath51 ( independent of grain size ) , and applies to both crystalline and amorphous silicates since their optical properties at @xmath52 are taken to be similar ( see  [ sec : opct_si ] ) .",
    "as expected , the contribution to the @xmath53 region would be considerable for @xmath54% ( although the effects on the optical and near - uv extinction are negligible ) . in view of ( 1 ) the uncertainties in the observed interstellar extinction in this wavelength region",
    "( for example , the determinations of mathis [ 1990 ] and fitzpatrick [ 1999 ] differ from one other by @xmath55 ) , ( 2 ) the fact that the size distributions of other components ( carbonaceous grains and @xmath56 silicates ) could be adjusted to reduce their contribution to the far - uv rise , and ( 3 ) the possibility that a mixture of ultrasmall silicates ( both neutral and charged ) might have a more gradual onset of uv absorption than our adopted silicate dielectric function ( which has a relatively sharp increase in absorption near 6.57.0@xmath57 ) , it seems clear that the observed uv extinction does not rule out @xmath51 as large as @xmath58 on lines of sight with @xmath59 .",
    "the 10@xmath0 m silicate _ absorption _ feature provides another constraint on the abundance of crystalline silicate grains of any size .",
    "a recent high signal - to - noise spectroscopic study of lines of sight towards cyg ob2 # 12 ( diffuse ism ) , elias 16 ( quiescent molecular cloud ) and elias 18 ( embedded yso ) in the taurus dark cloud appears to rule out any narrow absorption features between 8.4 and 12.5@xmath0 m ( bowey et al .",
    "1998 ) . figure [ fig : ext_ir ] plots the 10@xmath0 m silicate absorption profiles resulting from addition of various amounts ( @xmath51 ) of ultrasmall crystalline silicates to our best - fitting model ( see weingartner & draine 2001 ; li & draine 2001 ) .",
    "the absence of narrow features near 10.0 and 11.1@xmath6 in the observed 8.412.5@xmath6 extinction ( bowey et al .  1998 ) suggests an upper limit @xmath60 for crystalline silicates .",
    "note that this result is insensitive to size as the grains are in the rayleigh limit .    as noted above",
    ", the precise wavelengths and strengths of ir resonance features in crystalline silicates vary with composition , and there could be more than one crystalline form present in the interstellar medium .",
    "nevertheless , the lack of fine structure in the observed broad 10@xmath6 absorption feature makes it unlikely that more than @xmath55 of the interstellar si could be in crystalline silicates .",
    "this limit on crystalline silicates is more stringent than the limit on ultrasmall crystalline silicates obtained in  [ sec : upplimt_emsn ] .",
    "the upper limits on the abundances of ultrasmall silicate grains estimated from the ir emission spectra in ",

    "_ crystalline _ astronomical silicate material is less absorbing than `` astronomical silicate '' ( draine & lee 1984 ) , then photon absorptions will be less frequent and the ir emission correspondingly reduced , in which case the infrared emission limit on ultrasmall silicates would be relaxed . however , for crystalline silicates , the strongest constraint comes from lack of sharp absorption features near 10 and 11@xmath6 , so our upper limit is not affected by uncertainty in the 14@xmath57 absorption .    the observed 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath0 m emission bands ( mattila et al .",
