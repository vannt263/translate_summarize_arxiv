    "in 1998 , bender and boettcher introduced the non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric quantum systems @xcite .",
    "this letter ignited a very active field .",
    "hundreds of papers have been published on various aspects of this new quantum mechanics . for review , please see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "most of the studies have been focused on one - dimensional systems , very few have touched two or higher dimensions . in 2001 , bender _ et al _  studied the complex cubic potential @xmath1 and @xmath3 . using perturbation theory , they found real eigenvalues for the three lowest levels .",
    "they used the wkb method to confirm the reality of the ground state energy .",
    "their approach also applied to the complex hnon - heiles potential @xmath2 @xcite . in 2002 , nanayakkara and abayaratne revisited the @xmath4 interaction with a non - degenerated setup .",
    "they computed energy eigenvalues up to @xmath5 . with their choice of parameters , all eigenvalues appear to be real @xcite . later in the same year",
    ", nanayakkara obtained the analytic results for @xmath6 interaction and numerical results in @xmath7 and @xmath8 interactions .",
    "for all three systems , the author found real spectrum for small enough coupling constant and complex one for large coupling .",
    "the interaction of @xmath9 is also studied @xcite . in 2005 , nanayakkara observed avoided level crossings in both the real cubic interaction @xmath10 and the complex cubic interaction @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the results has been challenged in a comment by bla _",
    "et al _  in ref .",
    "@xcite . they pointed out that the quantum system with the real cubic potential is ill defined and the complex cubic potential has no avoided level crossings .    in this paper , we compute the eigenvalues of two - dimensional systems to high levels with high precision .",
    "we study the hamiltonians associated with the complex cubic potential @xmath11 @xmath12 and with the complex hnon - heiles potential @xmath13 @xmath14 both hamiltonians are not hermitian .",
    "rather , they respect the @xmath0 symmetry and the @xmath15 parity : @xmath16=0,&\\qquad & [ h,{\\cal p}_y]=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the total parity @xmath17 , the time reversal @xmath18 , and the @xmath15 parity @xmath19 are defined as @xmath20 although the hamiltonians are complex , the secular equations are real due to the @xmath0 symmetry",
    ". they can only depend on @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , both systems are invariant under @xmath22 .",
    "since the @xmath15 parity is an unbroken symmetry , we can diagonalize @xmath23 and @xmath19 simultaneously .",
    "all the eigenfunctions of @xmath23 are also eigenfunctions of @xmath19 with eigenvalues @xmath24 .",
    "we use different methods to compute the eigenvalues of each system .",
    "we found complex conjugate pairs when the levels cross between same @xmath15-parity states . at higher level",
    ", the level crossing happens at smaller coupling constant .",
    "this indicates that no matter how small the coupling constant is , there are always complex eigenvalues at high enough levels .",
    "it shows the rich structure in the two - dimensional @xmath0-symmetric quantum systems .",
    "one must be very careful when generalizing the results in one - dimensional non - hermitian quantum mechanics to higher dimensions .",
    "the paper is organized as the following : the methods we used are briefly reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] ; the results of different systems are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : xy2 ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : hh ] ; we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we use three different methods to study the spectra of hamiltonians in ( [ eqn : h12 ] ) and ( [ eqn : hhh ] ) .    *",
    "the first method is the perturbation theory . because the energy levels of unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath25 has degeneracy",
    ", we must apply the degenerate perturbation theory . after getting the eigenvalues as power series of the coupling constant @xmath26",
    ", we use pad expansions to extract the information from the divergent series .",
    "the results for two systems are shown as lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : xy2_re ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : hh_re ] , respectively . *",
    "the second method is numerical computation by the finite - element method ( fem ) .",
    "the fem results for eigenvalues with @xmath11 potential are shown as crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : xy2_re ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : xy2_im ] . *",
    "the third method is based on the expansion in two - dimensional harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis @xcite .",
    "we first analytically compute the non - vanishing matrix elements of the full hamiltonian on the two - dimensional ho eigenfunctions basis . depending on the precision requirement",
    ", we truncate the sparse matrix to a finite size . and the eigenvalues of the full hamiltonian can be obtained by numerically diagonalizing this finite matrix .",
    "this method is a mixture of analytic and numerical techniques .",
    "it turns out that this is the best way to compute the eigenvalues of the two - dimensional complex hamiltonians .",
    "the results are shown as dots in fig .",
    "[ fig : xy2_re ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : xy2_im ] and crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : hh_re ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : hh_im ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : xy2_re ] we can clearly to see that all three methods provide consistent informations about the real part of the eigenvalues . and fig .",
    "[ fig : xy2_im ] shows the two numerical methods are consistent on the imaginary part of the eigenvalues .",
    "using perturbation theory , we calculate the eigenvalues as power series of the coupling constant @xmath26 . here are the first few terms for the first 10 eigenvalues : @xmath27 we actually continue this expansion up to the order of @xmath28 , then use @xmath29 pad to extract the information from the divergent series .",
    "the results are shown as lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : xy2_re ] . from the figure",
    ", we may see that some pad expansions have poles and cross each others .    in the same figure ,",
    "we show the real parts of eigenvalues from fem as crosses and from ho expansions as dots .",
    "the two sets of numerical results clearly agree with each other . and",
    "surprisingly , up to the crossing points , the pad expansions fit the numerical results very well .",
    "although the hamiltonian @xmath30 has @xmath0 symmetry , some energy eigenvalues are complex .",
    "the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues by two numerical methods are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xy2_im ] .     with the complex cubic potential .",
    "lines are from perturbative expansion using @xmath29 pad .",
    "crosses are results using fem .",
    "dots are results using the method based on two - dimensional ho basis expansions .",
    "blue disks have even @xmath15-parity and purple squares have odd @xmath15-parity .",

    "[ fig : xy2_re ] , we observe two types of level crossings . if the crossing is between different @xmath15-parity states , the eigenvalues remain real .",
    "one example of this type is the crossing between the third and fourth lowest states near @xmath31 .",
    "if the crossing is between same @xmath15-parity states , then eigenvalues become complex conjugate pairs .",
    "for example , the sixth and seventh lowest states cross near @xmath32",
    ".    we also observed that the level crossing happens in higher levels at smaller value of coupling constant .",
    "this indicates that no matter how small the coupling constant is , there is always complex eigenvalues at high enough levels .",
    "there is no critical value , @xmath33 , such that for @xmath34 , the entire spectrum is real .",
    "in the case of the complex hnon - heiles potential , a similar patten appears . the energy eigenvalues become complex when @xmath35 .",
    "there are special features for this interaction .    * first , there are all rational numbers in every term of eigenvalues in the perturbation expansion . *",
    "second , there are an accident degeneracy between odd and even @xmath15-parity . most of the energy levels are degenerated , but interestingly , not all of them .",
    "for example , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , but @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the same up to the order of @xmath21 , but for the order of @xmath42 and higher , they separate .",
    "this patten remains the same for higher exciting states : * * for even @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , etc .",
    "* * for odd @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , etc .",
    "* * for odd @xmath46 , @xmath49 starting from the order of @xmath42 . * third , @xmath50 appears to be non - alternating in signs in the expansion . and",
    "this is a unique case up to @xmath51 .",
    "here are the first few terms for the first 21 eigenvalues : @xmath52 as in the previous section , we actually continue this expansion up to the order of @xmath28 , then use @xmath29 pad to extract the information from the divergent series .",
    "the results are shown as lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : hh_re ] .",
    "the results from ho expansions are shown as crosses in the same figure . once again , we found the pad expansions fit the numerical results up to the crossing points .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry is also broken in this hamiltonian .",
    "some eigenvalues cross and form complex conjugate pairs .",
    "the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues by ho expansions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hh_im ] .     with the complex hnon - heiles potential .",
    "lines are from perturbative expansion using @xmath29 pad .",
    "crosses are from ho expansions .",
    "even @xmath15-parity states are using `` @xmath53 '' and odd @xmath15-parity states are using `` @xmath54''.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]     with the complex hnon - heiles potential . only the results from ho expansions",
    "are shown .",
    "even @xmath15-parity states are using `` @xmath53 '' and odd @xmath15-parity states are using `` @xmath54''.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]",
    "we concluded that both hamiltonians have complex spectra .",
    "the origin of this broken @xmath0 symmetry is unclear",
    ". it could be due to the interaction between hermitian and non - hermitian potentials as in ref .",
    "it could also be due to the level contraction instead of level repulsion in the non - hermitian quantum mechanics .",
    "the results indicate that there is no critical value of the coupling constant to have reality in this degenerated setup . in the analogue with the @xmath6 interaction studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is possible that small enough coupling constant exhibits entire real spectrum in the non - degenerated setup .",
    "this would be confirmed by a future study .",
