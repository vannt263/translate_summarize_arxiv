    "the interplay of spin - orbit interaction and electron - electron interaction is a fertile area of research where new phases of matter and novel phenomena have been theoretically conjectured and experimentally realized @xcite .",
    "single - layer transition metal group - vi dichalcogenides ( tmds ) , ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , are direct band gap semiconductors that have all the necessary ingredients to explore this phenomena @xcite .",
    "while sharing the hexagonal crystal structure of graphene , they differ in three important aspects : ( 1 ) inversion symmetry is broken , resulting in a gap as opposed to dirac nodes ; ( 2 ) spin is coupled to momenta , yielding a large splitting of the valence bands ; and ( 3 ) the bands near the chemical potential predominantly have the transition metal @xmath3-orbital character @xcite .    the nontrivial berry curvature associated with the bands near the valleys is a consequence of strong spin - orbit coupling enabled by inversion symmetry breaking and heavy elements such as and .",
    "the berry curvature engenders an effective intrinsic angular momentum associated with the bloch wave functions . remarkably , spin - preserving optical transitions between valence and conduction bands are possible , even though the atomic orbitals involved all have a @xmath3-character .",
    "furthermore , the valley - dependent sign of the berry curvature leads to selective photoexcitation : right circular polarization couples to one valley , and left circular polarization to the other .",
    "consequently , this enables a number of valleytronic and spintronic applications that have attracted a lot of attention over the last few years @xcite .",
    "we are primarily interested in exploiting the band structure and valley - contrasting probe afforded by the nontrivial topology in order to study and manipulate correlated phenomena in these systems .",
    "in particular , we focus on hole - doped systems , where an experimentally accessible window in energy is characterized by two disconnected pieces of spin non - degenerate fermi surfaces . one can preferentially excite electrons from either fermi surface .",
    "since the spins are locked to their valley index , these excitations have specific @xmath4 ( where the @xmath5-axis is perpendicular to the two - dimensional crystal ) .",
    "we focus on the possible superconducting states and their properties .",
    "spin - valley locking and its consequence for superconductivity , dubbed ising superconductivity , has been previously studied for heavily doped @xmath6-type and @xmath7-type tmds @xcite , where fermi surfaces of each spin are present in each valley .",
    "our focus is the regime of maximal loss of spin degeneracy where the effects are most striking @xcite .",
    "the two valleys in the energy landscape generically allow two classes of superconducting phases : intervalley pairing with zero center of mass momentum , and intravalley pairing with finite cooper pair center of mass .",
    "since center - of - symmetry is broken and spin degeneracy is lost , classifications of superconducting states by parity , i.e. , singlet vs.  triplet , is no longer possible . in this paper , we study both extrinsic and intrinsic superconductivity by projecting the interactions and pairing potential to the topmost valence band . we identify the possible phases , and analyze the nature of the optoelectronic coupling and the response to magnetic fields .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :       for both proximity to an @xmath8-wave superconductor , and due to local attractive density - density interactions , the leading instability is due to an intervalley paired state , where the cooper pair is an equal mixture of a spin singlet and the @xmath0 spin triplet .",
    "while the valley selectivity of the optical transition is suppressed , it remains finite .",
    "consequently , the two quasiparticles generated by pair - breaking circularly polarized light are correlated such that one is in the valence band of one valley and the conduction band of the other .",
    "the valley and bands are determined by the polarity of incident light .",
    "the quasiparticles generated in ( 2 ) both have the same charge and berry curvature .",
    "thus an anomalous hall effect is anticipated as the two travel in the same direction transverse to an applied electric field .",
    "an in - plane magnetic field tilts the spin , modifying the internal structure of the cooper pair , however , no pair - breaking is induced in the absence of scalar impurities .",
    "the suppression of the effective interaction leads to a parametric reduction of the transition temperature . in the presence of scalar impurities ,",
    "pair - breaking is enabled , but the associated critical magnetic field is large .",
    "the tmd system is described by the effective tight - biding , low - energy , two - valley hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath9 the operators @xmath10 are pauli operators acting on the two bloch orbital states @xmath11 ( indexed by @xmath12 labeling @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) such that @xmath15 .",
    "the valley index @xmath16 , corresponding to the @xmath17 points , and the spin index @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) , corresponding to the @xmath5-component of the spin through @xmath20 , are good quantum numbers .",
    "the momentum @xmath21 is measured from the valley center , i.e. , for a given valley , the total momentum relative to the center of the brillouin zone is @xmath22 .",
    "the energy gap is @xmath23 , the spin splitting in the valence band is @xmath24 , the lattice constant is @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the effective hopping integral .    the energy spectrum , @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) indexing the conduction ( valence ) band is shown in [ fig : energy ] .     as given by [ eq : energy ] with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "each valley is centered at @xmath17 relative to the center of the brillouin zone .",
    "the energy for a given band depends only on the distance @xmath34 measured from the valley center . ]",
    "we focus on doped systems such that the chemical potential @xmath35 lies in the upper valence bands . within each band ,",
    "the bloch basis eigenstates are written in terms of the orbital states as elements on the block sphere , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 the polar angle on the bloch sphere of the conduction and valence bands are related by @xmath39 .",
    "the mapping of the energy band to the bloch sphere , parametrized by @xmath40 , encodes the topological character : as one moves from the node out to infinity , the states sweep either the northern or southern hemisphere with a chirality determined by the berry curvature .",
    "we consider two approaches to realizing a superconducting state .",
    "first , we assume a proximity induced state obtained by layering a tmd on an @xmath8-wave superconductor .",
    "second , we study an intrinsic correlated phase arising from density - density interactions .",
    "we use @xmath41 as the annihilation operator for tight - binding @xmath3-orbital states , and @xmath42 for the eigenstates of the non - interacting hamiltonian , @xmath43 for the energy dispersion for bogoliubov quasiparticles , and @xmath44 for the superconducting gap function .      a proximity @xmath8-wave superconductor will inject cooper pairs according to @xmath45 the coupling constants @xmath46 and the overall constant @xmath47 depend on the material interface .",
    "are restricted to @xmath48 less than some cutoff that restricts the momentum to a single valley . ] using the abbreviated notation @xmath49 , with @xmath50 for @xmath51 , projecting onto the upper valence bands yields , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and the effective bcs gap function is @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "this form is identical to the standard bcs hamiltonian with an effective spin index @xmath56 .",
    "however , the spin state of the cooper pair is an equal superposition of the singlet and the @xmath0 component of spin triplet .",
    "the corresponding quasiparticle eigenstates are @xmath57 , with energies @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , note that if @xmath60 , then @xmath44 is a constant and independent of @xmath21 . even when @xmath61 and @xmath62 are different , the constant term dominates . before exploring the nature of this state",
    ", we analyze the case of intrinsic superconductivity , and show that the same state is energetically preferred .      for a local attractive density - density interaction ( e.g.  one mediated by phonons )",
    ", the potential is @xmath63 , with @xmath64 and @xmath65 the total wannier electron density at lattice vector @xmath66 .",
    "projecting onto states near the chemical potential gives @xmath67 where @xmath68 the first two terms in [ eq : channels ] lead to intravalley pairing , and the third to intervalley pairing .",
    "we analyze the possible states within mean field theory .",
    "the bcs order parameter is @xmath69 where the form of @xmath70 depends on the particular pairing channel .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian has the same form as the bcs hamiltonian in [ eq : induced ] but with an effective @xmath71 .",
    "the intravalley pairing has three symmetry channels , with the couplings given by @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . for these channels , since @xmath75 , relabeling @xmath76 in the sum gives @xmath77 .",
    ", the intravalley pairing is not excluded by symmetry . specifically , repeating the calculation with this assumption , the intervalley terms fully cancel , and one obtains [ eq : channels ] without the intervalley term on the third line . ]",
    "the intervalley pairing also has three symmetry channels : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "of the three , the constant valued channel is dominant . and @xmath81 at the chemical potential .",
    "] this is to be expected , as the local density - density interaction leads to the largest pairing for electrons of opposite spins . since the intravalley processes have the same spin , they are disfavored as compared to the intervalley pairing .",
    "the key features of the intrinsic superconducting state are identical to the proximally induced case when density - density interactions dominate .",
    "we restrict further analysis to that case , and turn to the question of pair - breaking phenomena induced either by optical or magnetic fields .",
    "the non - interacting system displays valley selective optical excitations .",
    "light of a particular polarization only couples to one valley .",
    "since the superconducting state is a coherent condensate admixing the two valleys , we address whether pair - breaking displays similar valley selectivity .",
    "in particular , we explore whether or not the two quasiparticles generated by circularly polarized light , with total energy larger than @xmath82 , occupy opposite valleys , with one in the conduction band and the other in the valence band .",
    "the optical excitations arise from the berry curvature , which acts as an effective angular momentum .",
    "the electromagnetic potential @xmath83 , with polarization vector @xmath84 , is introduced using minimal coupling , @xmath85 , where , in the dipole approximation , @xmath86 .",
    "this yields a perturbed hamiltonian @xmath87 , where @xmath88 , with @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the transition rate is proportional to the modulus - squared of the optical matrix elements , @xmath91 , defined by @xmath92 for circularly polarized light , in the absence of superconductivity , @xmath93 and @xmath94     in the superconducting phase as a function of the ratio of the quasiparticle energy @xmath43 to the superconducting gap @xmath44 .",
    "material parameters for , , and are given in  @xcite and a gap of @xmath95 is chosen for illustrative purposes .",
    "the order - of - magnitude contrast between @xmath96 and @xmath97 causes the optical - valley selectivity . ]",
    "the transition rate matrix elements for optical excitations from the bcs ground state are given by [ eq : optical ] multiplied by a coherence factor @xmath98 . since @xmath39 , switching either the valley or polarization transforms @xmath99 in [ eq : optical ] , giving matrix elements @xmath100 corresponding to matching ( @xmath101 ) or mismatching ( @xmath102 ) polarization - valley indexes . for a given valley , a chosen polarization of light couples more strongly than the other , as is evident comparing @xmath103 to @xmath104 and shown in [ fig : optical ] . for incident light with energy @xmath105 , right circularly polarized light ( @xmath106 )",
    "has a higher probability of promoting a quasiparticle to the right conduction band , as reflected in the larger matrix element @xmath107 . as depicted in [ fig : optical - excitation ] , the partner of the cooper pair is in the valence band in the opposite valley .",
    "the other valley has the opposite dependence on polarization .",
    "this key new result opens the door for valley control of excitations from a coherent ground state .",
    "for example , the two quasiparticles have the same charge and berry curvature ( see below ) . in the presence of",
    "an electric filed , they both acquire the same transverse anomalous velocity . thus , in contrast to the response in the normal state , an anomalous hall effect is anticipated with no accompanying spin current .",
    "the berry curvature in the non - interacting crystal for left and right circularly polarized ( @xmath108 ) optical excitations for a given @xmath21 is @xmath109 , where    @xmath110          \\sin{{{\\theta}_{{\\tau } { { s}}}^{n } { \\left(k\\right ) } } } , \\\\      &",

    "the @xmath5-component of the berry curvature of the correlated state is zero , @xmath114 a single optically excited state in the left valley for a given @xmath21 is @xmath115 , which has a berry curvature @xmath116 .",
    "the corresponding excitation in the right valley has a berry curvature of the same magnitude but opposite sign .",
    "we briefly discuss the pair - breaking effects of an in - plane magnetic field and non - magnetic disorder .",
    "( the details are presented elsewhere . )",
    "the superconducting state exhibits an anomalous magnetic response due to the large spin - orbit interaction and spin splitting @xmath117 .",
    "unlike conventional superconductors , where a uniform magnetic field leads to pair - breaking from spin paramagnetism , here the zeeman coupling from an in - plane magnetic field in the clean system modifies the spin structure of the cooper pair and parametrically suppresses @xmath118 .",
    "modification of the effective coupling , rather than pair - breaking , causes this phenomena . while , in compliance with anderson s theorem , the lack of pair - breaking for non - magnetic impurities is recovered at zero field ( since time reversal symmetry is preserved ) , the transition is indeed suppressed by a pair - breaking effect from the combination of the magnetic field and scalar impurities .",
    "the pair - breaking effect is characterized by the parameter @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the bohr magneton and @xmath121 is the collision rate resulting from the scalar disorder potential .",
    "note that for a clean system , where @xmath122 , we recover the result that there is no pair - breaking . assuming a continuous phase transition induced by the magnetic field , the pair - breaking equation at temperature @xmath123 is @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the digamma function",
    ", @xmath126 is the transition temperature in the clean system ( weakly suppressed by the in - plane field ) , and @xmath127 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "this equation determines the upper critical field @xmath128 as a function of temperature . clearly , the upper critical field is greatly enhanced by the large spin - orbit interaction . at zero temperature ,",
    "the upper critical field is approximately @xmath129 .",
    "in this letter , we report on the nature of the superconducting state of hole - doped tmds .",
    "remarkably , the correlated state inherits the valley contrasting phenomena of the non - interacting state . while the magnitude is smaller , pair - breaking produces quasiparticles that have the same berry curvature , and hence the same anomalous velocity .",
    "thus one predicts an anomalous hall response unlike the valley hall response observed in .",
    "spin - valley locking leads to large critical magnetic fields .",
    "a similar phenomena was recently reported in heavily hole - doped ( beyond the spin - split gap ) @xcite . in the new regime , where only one band per valley intersects the chemical potential ,",
    "no pair - breaking occurs for in - plane fields unless disorder is present .",
    "while systematic synthesis and characterization of hole - doped systems is still in its early stages , the fact that other two - dimensional compounds and their bulk counterparts are known to be superconducting @xcite provides impetus to explore this novel phenomena .",
