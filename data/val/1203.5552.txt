    "einstein viewed the space - time as a pseudo - riemannian differentiable manifold in order to generalize the special - relativistic flat space - time to include gravity .",
    "this was primarily motivated by the fact that the local flatness of the manifold structure naturally implemented his principle of equivalence .",
    "the generalization came along with the revolutionary idea that the trajectory of any freely moving test body is simply a geodesic in the curved manifold , and that gravity is not a newtonian instantaneous action force , but an effect of the curvature of the space - time manifold .",
    "the basic constituents of the manifold structure are the _ metric _ , that defines the distance between any two points of the manifold , and the _ connection _ , that defines the covariant derivative and the curvature of the manifold .",
    "any theory of gravity should couple the dynamics of these quantities to the dynamics of the matter moving in the space - time manifold . among the existing theories , the ensuing field equations of general relativity ( gr ) are perhaps the simplest . since in gr , _ torsion _ , the antisymmetric combination of connection coefficients , is identically zero , and since gr has withstood numerous precise experimental tests @xcite , introduction of torsion has seemed superfluous except in the presence of matter with intrinsic spin as in einstein - cartan formulations @xcite .",
    "however , for two major reasons , alternate theories of gravity that reduce to gr in the weak field limit are seriously pursued .",
    "the first reason is that gr leads to inevitable singularities - black holes ( death of a massive star ) and big bang ( birth of the universe ) . though it is conventionally assumed that quantization would eliminate these singularities , gr is not readily amenable to quantization .",
    "the second reason is that the standard model of cosmology based on gr requires most of the universe to be composed of unknown dark energy in order to account for various cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "a common strategy to construct modified theories of gravity is to make the lagrangian density a nontrivial function of the ricci scalar @xcite and use the action principle to derive the modified field equations .",
    "another common strategy is to introduce extra - dimensions while constraining the physical particles to a ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional hyper - surface as in the brane - world theories @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore a different approach by introducing metric - dependent torsion in kaluza - klein type theories @xcite with one extra dimension .    in our approach",
    ", we consider a five - dimensional ( 5d ) manifold foliated by a family of 4d hyper - surfaces , whose geometries are virtually indistinguishable from that of the 4d space - time of gr .",
    "the axis of foliation is special in the sense that there could exist non - vanishing torsion components along that dimension .",
    "we impose constraints on the connection so that any motion in the fifth dimension does not affect observations based on the geodesic motions along the 4d hyper - surfaces , thus keeping the fifth dimension essentially hidden .",
    "the imposed constraints determine uniquely all the non - vanishing torsion components in terms of the 5d metric fields , making this a purely metric theory of gravity .",
    "besides uniquely determining the torsion in the 5d geometry , the imposed constraints lead to interesting equivalence between the 5d geometry with torsion and the torsion - free 4d geometry of gr .",
    "in particular , the components of the connection and the ricci tensor along the 4d hypersurfaces turn out to exactly match what would arise from gr on a 4d space - time .",
    "consequently , any test of this theory based on geodesic motions will yield the same results as gr .",
    "though by construction , the extra - dimension is hidden at the level of geodesic motion , its effect is clearly reflected in the field equations .",
    "the field equations are obtained by imposing the constraints on the action and varying it with respect to the metric .",
    "this leads to global solutions qualitatively distinct from those obtained from gr .",
    "most notably , we find positive mass naked singularity solutions that match the schwarzschild solution at large distances but lack an event horizon . in the cosmological context",
    ", we find oscillatory solutions in contrast to the inevitable singular big bang in standard cosmology .",
    "we begin section ii with a review of the general framework of the 5d geometry .",
    "section iii deals with the specification of the constraints and the determination of the torsion and connection in terms of the metric .",
    "section iv is devoted to the derivation of modified einstein equations from the standard action principle using ricci scalar as the lagrangian density . in section",

    ", torsion is incorporated in a novel way in higher dimensional kaluza - klein type theories . here",
    "torsion is not an independent degree of freedom coupled to spin , rather it is determined in terms of metric through a set of physically motivated constraints , which serve ( i ) to confine torsion to the extra dimension , leaving the 4d space - time torsion free , and ( ii ) to ensure that geodesic motions in 4d remain totally unaffected by the presence of the extra - dimension .",
    "these constraints have previously been imposed in terms of veilbeins @xcite , but here it is realized that they impose essentially the requirement that the fifth dimension is hidden at the level of geodesic motion .",

    "hence , at the level of geodesics , this geometry is virtually indistinguishable from that of the standard gr .    to proceed further , we derive modified einstein equations from the action principle with ricci scalar as the lagrangian density . in this respect ,",
    "an alternate approach presents itself . in the palatini formulation of gr ,",
    "the action is varied independently with respect to the connection , and in the absence of torsion , the metricity follows from the equations of motion .",
    "recently @xcite , it has been shown that even without assuming the absence of torsion , variations of the action independently with respect to the metric and the connection lead to gr equations along with metricity , provided the matter lagrangian is not coupled to the connection . in our case , with the constraints imposed on the connection , it is more convenient and natural to impose metricity prior to action variation . since the entire connection is determined to be a function of the metric , we only need to vary the action with respect to the metric to obtain the modified equations , making the theory a purely metric theory of gravity .",
    "however , adopting a palatini - style approach , one could relax the assumption of metricity and vary the action independently with respect to metric and connection along with the imposed constraints , which might lead to a different set of modified einstein equations .",
    "we apply the ensuing modified einstein equations to study the cosmology of a homogenous - isotropic universe .",

    "cosmology , the second derivative of @xmath91 can not be independently prescribed as an initial condition , and decelerating expansion is a necessary outcome in the absence of a cosmological constant .",
    "however in our case , we have the choice of an initial condition for the second derivative of @xmath91 , which can be tuned to fit the observed acceleration of the universe .",
    "figure [ cosmologyfig ] presents the behavior of @xmath91 for various choices of the current acceleration .    in an earlier version of the present work @xcite , the field equations were derived differently ; by varying the action with respect to the metric prior to expressing the ricci tensor in terms of the metric . in the cosmology equations generated from those field equations , acceleration was not an independently prescribable initial condition .",
    "chen and jing @xcite showed that those equations yield accelerating universe solutions without resorting to dark energy .",
    "they show that the model not only fits the supernovae data , but also solves the cosmic age problem of old high redshift objects @xcite .",
    "whether the cosmological solutions described in the current work would fit empirical results just as well needs to be investigated .    in the case of spherically symmetric vacuum solutions to the modified einstein equations ,",
    "we find some remarkably interesting results . as is well known , in the unique schwarzschild solution of gr , when the mass is positive , an event horizon censors the central singularity .",
    "in contrast , we find positive mass naked singularity solutions that lack an event horizon .",
    "recently , similar positive mass solutions without a horizon have been found @xcite in a simpler setting of torsion - free gr with multiple extra - dimensions .",
    "it would be interesting to see how the particular vacuum solutions in the torsion induced geometry in the present case match with those solutions in the torsion free geometry .",
    "the existence of positive mass solutions with naked singularity have immediate consequences on gravitational collapse , opening up the possibility of an arbitrarily large star collapsing to an arbitrarily small non - singular state .",
    "since trapped surfaces would not necessarily form in such collapses , finite matter pressure could be sufficient to withstand a total collapse to singularity .",
    "this suggests a detailed analysis of such solutions by treating @xmath69 in eq .",
    "[ ee1 ] as extra - dimensionally induced matter in standard gr .",
    "it then raises the possibility of a sufficiently strong gravitational collapse that stops short of collapsing to a singularity with a finite induced stress - energy tensor that potentially violates the weak energy condition in the region near the center .",
    "it remains to be seen if an arbitrarily small static model star with finite stress - energy tensor can be constructed with the external geometry matching the type of solutions discussed in this paper .    in conclusion ,",
    "inclusion of torsion in the context of extra - dimensions presents a novel way of obtaining modified einstein equations that have significant physical consequences . for clarity and simplicity ,",
    "we have confined the treatment to five dimensions .",
    "however , the framework can be generalized to arbitrary dimensions @xmath200 , producing torsion - free @xmath201 dimensional metric theory .",
