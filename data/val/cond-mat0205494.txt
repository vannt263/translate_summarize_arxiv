    "the techniques and technology related to fabricating large single crystals of elemental materials like silicon ( si ) or compounds like gallium arsenide ( gaas ) has been perfected for decades now .",
    "polished wafers of such single crystalline semiconductor materials are now routinely used as substrates , on which a series of thin layers are grown to create a desired heterostructure .",
    "thin films of increasing complexity are now being fabricated due to constraints on operating conditions and performance of electronic and optical devices .    when the growth of the superimposed material layers is based on the atomic pattern of the substrate underneath , as if it is the extension of substrate structure , then the process is referred to as an epitaxial growth .",
    "heteroepitaxy is the technique in which a thin film of a different material is grown on a substrate ( as for example in a layer growth of alas on gaas ) , and in which the deposited layer has the same crystal orientation as the substrate .",
    "many materials ( especially iii - v compounds ) , though composed of different atoms , have identical crystal structures and nearly identical lattice spacing .",
    "a match of lattice spacing is important in epitaxial growth since it can minimize and possibly eliminate local strains in the growing film , and thus produce good quality thin solid layers .",
    "for example , one can in principle lattice - match an ingaasp quaternary alloy of appropriate composition to either inp or gaas , and tailor - make a semiconductor film which will have the electronic band gap within the range between @xmath0 ev and @xmath1 ev .",
    "although the alloy composition can be tuned to obtain a desirable band gap , the resulting device is useful only if the alloy composition remains homogeneous . in a typical epitaxial growth technique like molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) ,",
    "the stability of the growing film can depend on many variables .",
    "the homogeneity of the growing film clearly depends on the surface mobility of the material being deposited , the substrate temperature @xmath2 , and the deposition rate @xmath3 .",
    "further , different sized atoms that are being deposited to fabricate an alloy film induce stresses in the substrate which in turn affect the behavior on the surface .",
    "in fact , the process of epitaxial growth is a nonequilibrium phenomenon in which surface , interfacial and elastic energies along with surface diffusion and alloy segregation play active roles . during the nonequilibrium growth of alloy films , elastic stress may be relieved through nucleation of dislocations and other defects .",
    "inhomogeneities can also arise on account of two potential instabilities , from which the generation of dislocations can be avoided and one can obtain high quality thin film materials .",
    "these are the morphological instability and alloy segregation instability .",
    "morphological instability @xcite can be understood through two features : a solid film adsorbate on a solid substrate creates a uniaxial stress , and the driving force for surface diffusion of matter is proportional to the local strain energy density .",
    "if a small corrugation occurs on the surface of a uniaxially strained solid , local strain energy concentration is created at its valleys . as",
    "a result diffusion of matter occurs along the surface from valleys to peaks of the corrugation .",
    "valleys then deepen due to loss of mass which leads to a further increase of local strain energy driving the instability .",
    "surface energy plays a stabilizing role here : as corrugations deepen , surface area increases which has an associated energy cost inhibiting the growth of instability .",
    "the alloy segregation instability is driven by alloy thermodynamics .",
    "@xcite it is typically modelled by a ginzburg - landau type free energy ( the order parameter @xmath4 is related to the binary alloy concentration ) in which the quadratic term has a coefficient proportional to @xmath5",
    ". this term changes sign for @xmath6 and leads to an instability which drives a homogeneous mixture to segregate .",
    "this mechanism is called spinodal decomposition and is applicable for not too asymmetric mixtures within the classical spinodal . for asymmetric mixtures between the spinodal and coexistence curves ,",
    "the mixture is metastable and requires large amplitude fluctuations to segregate via a nucleation mechanism .    in this paper",
    "we consider strained film growth without nucleation , and assume the growing film to be a coherent , dislocation - free binary or pseudo - binary alloy .",
    "stability of such films have been considered previously both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the systems explored experimentally include sige and ingaas .",
    "other interesting experimental studies include : single component films ( ge on a si substrate ) , @xcite gaas homoepitaxy,@xcite self - organised gaas islands , @xcite etc . ;",
    "but these are not as relevant here .",
    "many of these experimental papers show that stressed growing films can develop non - planar morphologies without dislocations or nucleation , for both symmetric binary alloy films ( 50 - 50 mixture ) as well as asymmetric films .",
    "the onset of instability is measured through a kinetic critical thickness @xmath7 ( film thickness at which surface roughness first appears ) , and the characteristic wavelength of the instability has also been determined by experiments .    early theoretical work focused on explaining nonplanar surface morphologies through the competition between surface energy and elastic strain energy arising from lattice mismatch @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the average bulk film lattice parameter and @xmath10 is the substrate lattice spacing .",
    "the important effects due to composition dependence of the film lattice parameter @xmath11 , represented by the solute expansion coefficient @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath4 is the local concentration field , were added in a kinetic treatment of the growing film .",
    "intricate dependence on @xmath13 and @xmath14 leads to sensitivity of the morphological development to the sign of the misfit @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ compressive and tensile regions of the growing film behave differently .",
    "another important factor , the composition dependence of the elastic moduli , can also impact on the stability of the film and its sensitivity to the sign of @xmath13.@xcite experimental observations can provide a sensitive test of these theories in connection with the @xmath13-asymmetry in the stability diagram of the growing film , the coupling between morphological instability and alloy segregation , as well as the behaviors of critical thickness .",
    "an additional factor is the differing atomic mobilities of the two ( or more ) species on the growing film surface , and has been investigated in recent theoretical work .",
    "this consideration is based on recent experimental results of atomic mobilities on surface .",
    "e.g. , the activation energy of step mobility for ge on ge(001 ) surface was measured to be smaller than that of si on si(001 ) , @xcite corresponding to much larger atomic mobility for ge . however , during the mbe growth for semiconductors ( e.g. , si - ge system or iii - v alloys ) , dimerized atoms are quickly formed on ( 001 ) top surface when new materials are deposited , leading to a typical phenomenon of surface reconstruction.@xcite these dimers , which may be comprised of unlike alloy components or like atoms , diffuse over the surface with diffusion processes and properties more complicated than and different from that of monomers .",
    "@xcite for example , in ge - on - si submonolayer system the surface pattern with si - ge mixed dimers rather than ge - ge dimers can be observed.@xcite a mixed si - ge dimer can diffuse as a unit , or transform into a pure dimer between like atoms ( si - si ) due to atomic exchange with underlying substrate atom and can also return back to the mixed form due to re - exchange process . therefore , different alloy components deposited on surface may or may not diffuse independently . in the following studies we consider an effective surface mobility ( or effective surface diffusivity @xmath15 ) to describe the processes of surface diffusion and decomposition in continuum approximation .    in this paper",
    "our starting point is the work of lonard and desai .",
    "it is reviewed in ref .   and",
    "the basic model on which some refinements are made is described in ref .  .",
    "here we further develop the model to a more general case , and more importantly , we consider two key features in the epitaxial growth systems : the first one is the coupling between top surface and underlying bulk of the growing film , which leads to a new dynamic equation for the evolution of surface compositional variable ( @xmath16 ) ; the second one is the composition dependence of all the three elastic constants , including the young s modulus @xmath17 , shear modulus @xmath18 and poisson ratio @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) . in ref .  , the shear modulus was assumed to be constant and the surface - bulk coupling was neglected in dynamical equations .",
    "these new considerations can lead to stability results different from that of the previous theoretical work for strained alloy films , and more complicated and richer properties of the system can be obtained .",
    "here we are interested in the growing films with deposition rate @xmath21 , while the results for isothermal annealing alloy films without growth ( @xmath22 ) are presented elsewhere .",

    "let us consider a strained alloy system composed of a semi - infinite substrate occupying the region @xmath23 and a a@xmath24b@xmath25 binary or pseudo - binary alloy film in the region @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath27 refers to the vertical position at which the film - substrate interface is located , and @xmath28 is the surface height variable of the growing film .",

    "its average value @xmath32 is equal to @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the alloy composition .",
    "here we focus on the symmetric mixture film , i.e. , @xmath35 alloy for which @xmath36 , while in the substrate @xmath37 we have @xmath38 since the compositional fluctuation is usually assumed to be absent there .    for this system of epitaxial growth ,",
    "the film is assumed to be elastically isotropic and coherent with the substrate , without any misfit dislocations or other defects . on the top surface of the growing film ,",
    "the evaporation and re - condensation are negligible if the deposition of material occurs under ultra - high vacuum condition , like the growth through mbe , and then the system evolution should correspond to conserved dynamics .",
    "we also assume that there is no interdiffusion between film and substrate , and the diffusion and compositional relaxation in the bulk film can be neglected , since the bulk mobility of film components is miniscule compared to that on the surface in typical epitaxial growth .",
    "the neglect of the bulk mobility implies that the composition profile within the film reflects the time - history of the growing film and is dependent on the deposition rate @xmath3 .",
    "as well the layers within the film are buried metastable layers which are frozen on account of negligible mobility in the bulk .",
    "therefore , the bulk concentration field @xmath39 at some time @xmath40 is equal to the surface field @xmath16 of an earlier time , i.e. , @xmath41 for @xmath42 , where @xmath43 with @xmath44 the average surface height , and then we have @xmath45    consequently , the conserved dynamics of morphological and compositional evolution is dominated by the surface diffusion and surface decomposition processes , with two time - dependent essential dynamical variables : the surface morphology @xmath28 and the concentration field at the surface @xmath46 .",

    "therefore , combining figs .",
    "[ fig - hc - v ] ( b ) and [ fig - hc - eps ] ( b ) , we conclude that the asymmetry of effective stabilization for ingaas - type films is dependent on both the deposition rate and the magnitude of misfit strain .",
    "in this paper , we have determined the stability properties for growth of dislocation - free and coherent , strained alloy films by developing a continuum dynamical model and performing a linear stability analysis . in our model",
    "there are two important and new features , the coupling between top surface of the film and the bulk underneath , and the composition dependence of elastic moduli ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , which result in new stability results .",
    "both the thermodynamics and elastic effects are considered .",
    "besides the phase separation mechanism at low temperature and the role of surface energy that favours the planar surface , we also include the effects of elasticity which can arise due to ( i ) the mismatch of lattice constant between a growing film and the substrate , resulting in nonzero misfit strain @xmath13 ; ( ii ) the dependence of lattice constant on composition , leading to nonzero solute strain represented by a coefficient @xmath14 ; and ( iii ) the dependence of elastic moduli on composition , as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq - eu ] ) . moreover",
    ", the deposition rate can play an important role for the growing films .",
    "the main results , due to the interplay of these factors , that we obtain can be summarized as follows .",
    "for single - component epitaxial growth , when one studies the stability of the free surface of a growing film , the morphological corrugation may lead to the formation of coherent islands .",
    "this occurs on account of the misfit strain caused by lattice mismatch .",
    "in contrast , for multi - component growth like mbe , the time evolution of the morphological profile is coupled to the dynamics of composition .",
    "physically the coupling occurs since smaller ( larger ) atoms of the film prefer to incorporate in regions of compressive ( tensile ) stress .",
    "this leads smaller atoms to preferentially diffuse to troughs ( peaks ) and larger atoms to segregate to peaks ( troughs ) , for a film under compression ( tension ) . as a result of the coupling ,",
    "there is a joint modulation of the surface morphological profile and the alloy composition , as well as a common perturbation growth rate @xmath212 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq - h1 ] ) , ( [ eq - phi1 ] ) , and ( [ eq - sigma ] ) ) .",
    "thus a planar surface can be stabilized only if alloy decomposition is suppressed and vice versa . some experiments ( sige @xcite and ingaas ) have verified such a simultaneous development of morphological and compositional modulations .    for _ bulk _ strained alloys ,",
    "the compositional profile is homogeneous above the bulk coherent spinodal temperature @xmath196 , and the decomposition can occur only below @xmath196 .",
    "however , for multi - component epitaxial _ films _",
    ", alloy decomposition occurs both theoretically and experimentally even for temperature @xmath2 higher than @xmath196 .",
    "this is due to two major effects .",
    "first , due to the coupling between morphological and compositional profiles , the phase separation can be driven by the difference in strain energy densities along the surface caused by the morphological undulation . even in the absence of @xmath14 , that is , when the atomic size difference is negligible , the composition dependence of the film elastic constants can be the cause of coupling between morphology @xmath47 and composition @xmath4 , as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq - quad ] ) and ( [ eq - a10 - 1 ] ) for special case of @xmath257 but @xmath229 .",
    "the second effect is related to solute stress ( or @xmath14 ) itself . as depicted in eqs .",
    "( [ eq - a10 - 2 ] ) and ( [ eq - st - eps0 + ] ) for @xmath308 and @xmath258 , when the morphological and compositional degrees of freedom are decoupled and we have stable surface morphology , alloy decomposition can also occur for @xmath219 if @xmath221 is large enough .",
    "this means that when the solute stress is too strong , corresponding to very large difference in the atomic sizes of alloy components , the small and large species prefer to segregate with respect to very small background disturbances of surface profile .",
    "this compositional instability , as well as the morphological modulation , can be completely suppressed by high deposition rate , both for @xmath2 above and below coherent spinodal @xmath196 , as seen in the stability diagrams of figs .",
    "[ fig - epsv - sige ] and [ fig - epsv - ingaas ] as well as from the analytic results derived for special cases in sec .",

    "the coupling between film surface and underlying bulk has resulted in some interesting results .",

    "[ fig - epsv - sige ] and [ fig - epsv - ingaas ] ) and the variation of kinetic critical thickness ( figs .",
