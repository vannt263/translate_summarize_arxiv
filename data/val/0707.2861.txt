    "in a mean - field theoretical framework the macroscopic wavefunction of a dilute gaseous bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) is governed by a classical nonlinear evolution equation , namely the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity in the gp model is introduced by the interatomic interactions , which are taken into regard through an effective mean field .",
    "the coefficient ( coupling constant ) @xmath0 of the nonlinear term in the gp equation is controlled by the @xmath1-wave scattering length @xmath2 , whose sign and magnitude determine many of the fundamental properties of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) such as their shape , collective excitations or statistical fluctuations @xcite .",
    "importantly , the scattering length can be tuned by an external magnetic @xcite , optical @xcite , or dc - electric @xcite field .",
    "the possibility of controlling the interatomic interactions in becs has inspired many experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "the former include ( among others ) the generation of bright matter - wave solitons @xcite , while the latter predict that time - dependent scattering lengths can be employed to arrest collapse in two @xcite and three @xcite dimensional attractive becs or to create robust solitons @xcite , periodic waves @xcite and shock waves @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , recently , the possibility of varying the scattering length _ spatially _ has been proposed , utilizing , e.g. , an inhomogeneous external magnetic field in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "these , so - called , `` collisionally inhomogeneous '' becs have recently attracted much attention , as they are relevant to many interesting applications such as adiabatic compression of matter - waves @xcite , bloch oscillations of matter - wave solitons @xcite , atomic soliton emission @xcite , enhancement of transmittivity of matter - waves through barriers @xcite , dynamical trapping of matter - wave solitons @xcite , and so on .",
    "moreover , rigorous mathematical results concerning the existence and the stability of solutions of the relevant gp equations also appeared @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we consider an elongated attractive bec , with inhomogeneous interatomic interactions , which is confined in a highly anisotropic harmonic trap , such that the condensate is confined solely in the transverse ( @xmath3 ) direction and free in the longitudinal ( @xmath4 ) one .",

    "( [ 1dgpe ] ) has a spatial dependence of the form , @xmath13 in the region @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being a small parameter .",
    "such a setting may be realized in a lithium condensate , by applying an external magnetic field with a dc value corresponding to the minimum of the scattering length of @xmath16li @xcite , and a linear gradient , which is controlled by the parameter @xmath15 ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "note that the number of atoms @xmath17 in the condensate is given by @xmath17@xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the integral of motion ( norm ) for the normalized gp eq .",
    "( [ 1dgpe ] ) .",
    "as is well known , in the homogeneous limit of @xmath20 , the gp equation becomes the completely integrable nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , possessing bright soliton solutions . in the inhomogeneous case @xmath21 ,",
    "soliton solutions can still be found and studied analytically ( for sufficiently small @xmath15 ) by means of the adiabatic perturbation theory for solitons @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "importantly , in this adiabatic regime , bright solitons feel an effective trapping potential induced by the inhomogeneity , in which both the center and the amplitude of the solitons perform oscillations when displaced from @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to demonstrate that these persistent oscillations are associated to the existence of a discrete eigenvalue in the corresponding linear eigenvalue problem .",
    "this eigenvalue , as well as the associated eigenmode , which is actually the _ translation _ mode of the solitary wave , manifests itself due to the inhomogeneity - induced perturbation ( see also @xcite for a relevant discussion concerning the so - called _ internal modes _ of the solitary waves in nearly - integrable systems ) .",
    "we will treat the eigenvalue problem analytically using an approach based on the general theory of perturbed hamitlonian dynamical systems of the nonlinear schrdinger type as developed in @xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "this way , we will derive the above mentioned discrete eigenfrequency associated with the translation mode .",
    "moreover , we will demonstrate that this eigenfrequency is , in fact , the strength of the effective harmonic trap induced by the inhomogeneity , and , as such , it can directly be derived employing the adiabatic perturbation theory for solitons .",
    "numerical results are found to be in excellent agreement with the analytical predictions .    finally , we also study a modified 1d gp model , which takes into account the effect of dimensionality .",
    "in fact , we explore the so - called nonpolynomial schrdinger equation ( npse ) @xcite , which can effectively describe the longitudinal wavefunction of a truly three - dimensional ( 3d ) `` cigar - shaped '' bec .",
    "the npse model can be expressed in the following dimensionless form : @xmath23\\phi ,   \\label{1dnpse}\\ ] ] in which space , time and density are normalized as in the 1d gp eq .",

    "( [ gofz ] ) .",
    "we consider the linear eigenvalue problem for the npse model as well , and show that the deviation from the purely 1d regime results in an eigenfrequency upshift .",
    "the value of the pertinent eigenfrequency will be compared to the oscillation frequency of a bright soliton in the full 3d gp model .",
    "it is shown that the agreement between the two is fairly good for sufficiently small values of the normalized number of atoms @xmath25 , i.e. , sufficiently below the collapse threshold .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the analytical and numerical results pertaining to the 1d gp equation .",
    "then , in section iii we study the effect of dimensionality on the translation mode s frequency .",
    "finally , in section iv we summarize our findings .",
    "let us follow the approach , based on general theory of perturbed hamiltonian eigenvalue problems , of @xcite to show the existense of the translation mode of the collisionally - inhomogeneous matter - wave soliton , and calculate its eigenfrequency .",
    "first we note that in the unperturbed case of @xmath20 , the gp eq .",
    "( [ 1dgpe ] ) possesses an exact stable stationary bright soliton solution of the form , @xmath26 \\exp(-i \\mu t ) ,   \\label{brightsol}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the soliton s amplitude and inverse width , @xmath28 is the soliton center , and @xmath29 is the soliton s chemical potential . in the case",
    "@xmath21 , the integrability is broken but eq .",
    "( [ 1dgpe ] ) is still a hamiltonian system , with hamiltonian @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are given by [ for @xmath24 given by eq .",
    "( [ gofz ] ) ] : @xmath33 the condition for the solution of eq .",
    "( [ brightsol ] ) to be sustained under the considered perturbation is that the solution remains an extremum of the perturbed energy @xmath32 @xcite , which in our case happens for @xmath34 .",
    "the stability of the perturbed solitary wave is then determined by the location of the eigenvalues associated with the translation and phase invariance ( the symmetries of the unperturbed problem which control the near - zero eigenvalues of the linearized equations ) .",
    "having in mind that the four relevant eigenfrequencies were located at the origin @xmath35 of the spectral plane of eigenfrequencies @xmath36 ( in the unperturbed system ) , one may follow @xcite and find the new location of the eigenfrequencies ( in the perturbed system ) by means of the equation : @xmath37 where the matrices @xmath38 and @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the above equations , star denotes complex conjugate , @xmath42 is the inner product , and @xmath43 is the functional ( frchet ) derivative .",
    "note that the matrix @xmath38 is generally diagonal , with nonzero elements @xmath44 and @xmath45 acounting , respectively , for the perturbation - induced breaking of the translational and phase invariance .",
    "however , in our case , the considered form of the inhomogeneous nonlinearity does not break the phase invariance of the system and , as a result , @xmath46 . as we will show below , a consequence of the phase invariance of the system is the appearance of a double zero eigenfrequency in the linear spectrum .",
    "the nonzero elements of the matrices @xmath38 , @xmath39 can be directly calculated and the results are @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ lambda ] ) leads to the following simple algebraic equation , @xmath50 equation ( [ ef ] ) provides the double zero eigenfrequency @xmath51 reflecting the phase invariance of the system , as well as the new location of the eigenfrequencies which were associated to the translational invariance ( which is now broken due to the presence of the spatially inhomogeneous nonlinearity ) .",
    "in fact , the latter pair of eigenfrequencies provides the frequency of the translation mode ( which will be called @xmath52 ) which is given by @xmath53 . to this end , using the relation @xmath29 , the latter result can be expressed as @xmath54 it is interesting to note that an alternative analytical approach can be used to obtain the value of the eigenfrequency .",
    "this approach is based on the adiabatic perturbation theory for solitons @xcite , which states that approximate soliton solutions , characterized by parameters that are unknown functions of time , can still be found for the perturbed system ( [ 1dgpe ] ) . following the methodology expounded in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is straightforward to find that the soliton s center evolves according to the following equation of motion , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the initial soliton amplitude . taking into regard",
    "that @xmath57 , it is readily found that eq .",
    "( [ em ] ) becomes @xmath58 , where @xmath52 is given by eq .",
    "( [ w_panos ] ) .",
    "this means that the soliton center behaves like a newtonian unit - mass particle in the presence of the effective trapping potential @xmath59 .",
    "thus , when displaced from the trap s center ( @xmath60 ) , the soliton will perform harmonic oscillations with frequency @xmath52 , which is nothing but the eigenfrequency of the translation mode of the solitary wave .",
    "this result indicates the physical significance of the translation mode s eigenfrequency , which is the same as the soliton oscillation frequency in the effective trapping potential induced by the inhomogeneous interactions .",
    "the above analytical predictions have been checked by two different types of numerical simulations , in which @xmath52 was directly derived by a linear stability analysis of eq .",

    "<S> we investigate bright matter - wave solitons in the presence of a spatially varying nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that a translation mode is excited due to the spatial inhomogeneity and its frequency is derived analytically and also studied numerically . </S>",
    "<S> both cases of purely one - dimensional and `` cigar - shaped '' condensates are studied by means of different mean - field models , and the oscillation frequencies of the pertinent solitons are found and compared with the results obtained by the linear stability analysis . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results are shown to be in very good agreement with the corresponding analytical predictions . </S>"
