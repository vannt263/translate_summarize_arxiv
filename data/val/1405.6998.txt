    "the theory of nonlinear electrodynamics was first introduced in @xmath1 by born and infeld for the purpose of solving various problems of divergence appearing in the maxwell theory @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the study of nonlinear electrodynamics has got a new impetus .",
    "strong motivation comes from developments in string / m - theory , which is a promising approach to quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the born - infeld ( bi ) theory naturally arises in the low energy limit of the open string theory @xcite .",
    "another motivation originates from the fact that most physical systems in the nature , including the field equations of the gravitational systems , are intrinsically nonlinear .",
    "the nonlinear bi electromagnetic theory was designed to regulate the self - energy of a point - like charge @xcite .",
    "various aspects of black hole solutions coupled to nonlinear bi gauge field has been studied .",
    "exact solutions of the einstein bi theory with or without cosmological constant have been constructed in fern , tamaki , dey , cai1,mhd . in the scalar - tensor theories of gravity , black object solutions coupled to a born - infeld nonlinear electrodynamics",
    "have also been studied widely in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , bi theory is not the only nonlinear electrodynamics theory which can remove the divergence of the electric field at @xmath2 . in particular , in recent years , other types of nonlinear electrodynamics in the context of gravitational field have been introduced . in @xcite exact solution for a static spherically symmetric field outside a charged point particle",
    "is found in a nonlinear @xmath3 gauge theory with a logarithmic lagrangian .",
    "while this particular theory appears to have no direct relation to superstring theory , it serves as a toy model illustrating that certain nonlinear field theories can produce particle - like solutions which can realize the limiting curvature hypothesis also for gauge fields @xcite .",
    "in addition to bi and logarithmic types for nonlinear gauge fields , very recently one of the present authors proposed an exponential form of nonlinear electromagnetic lagrangian @xcite .",
    "although a logarithmic form of the electrodynamic lagrangian , like bi electrodynamics , removes divergences in the electric field , the exponential form of nonlinear electromagnetic lagrangian does not cancel the divergency of the electric field at @xmath2 , however , its singularity is much weaker than in the einstein - maxwell theory .",
    "other studies on the gravitational systems coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics gauge fields have been carried out in pmipaper , oliveira , soleng2 .",
    "the extension of the maxwell field to the nonlinear electromagnetic gauge field provides powerful tools for investigation of black object solutions . in the present work",
    ", we would like to turn the investigations on the nonlinear electrodynamics to the rotating black string solutions with one rotation parameter in the anti - de sitter ( ads ) background .",
    "we will consider the four dimensional action of einstein gravity with two kinds of bi type nonlinear electromagnetic gauge fields .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in the next section we present the basic field equations as well as the lagrangian of two types of nonlinear electrodynamic fields .",

    "in addition , within the framework of quantum electrodynamics , it was shown that quantum corrections lead to nonlinear properties of vacuum which affect the photon propagation @xcite .",
    "although in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics , bi theory is a specific model , the recent interest in the nonlinear electrodynamics theories is mainly due to their emergence in the context of the low - energy limit of heterotic string theory , where a quartic correction of maxwell field strength appear @xcite . in other words",
    ", it was shown that all order loop corrections to gravity may be added up as a born - infeld type lagrangian @xcite .",

    "static and stationary black object solutions of these theories have been established and their thermodynamics have been studied during the past decades ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the advantages of the nonlinear electrodynamics in comparison to the maxwell field is that it avoids the divergences at the origin and leads to a finite electric field on the point particles .    in this paper as a new step , we considered two types of nonlinear electrodynamic lagrangians as source .",
    "the first one is called the logarithmic form and the second one named the exponential form .",

    "if one expand the nonlinear electromagnetic fields for large @xmath0 , one finds that the asymptotic behavior of them is similar to the linear maxwell field .",
    "we also calculated the curvature invariants of the spacetime and showed that there is indeed a curvature singularity located at @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , we found that , unlike einstein - maxwell black string solutions , for small values of the nonlinearity parameter , one can obtain a black string with a non - extreme horizon .",
    "we also calculated the conserved quantities of the rotating black string such as the mass and the angular momentum as well as the thermodynamic quantities such as the temperature and entropy associated with the horizon and checked that the obtained conserved and thermodynamic quantities satisfy the first law of black hole thermodynamics .    finally , it is worthwhile to study the dynamic as well as thermodynamic stability of the solutions , and investigate the effects of nonlinearity parameter , @xmath107 , on the stability of the presented solutions .",
