    "extrapolating the zener model of carrier - induced ferromagnetism to wide bandgap diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) predicts that high critical temperatures should be achieved , provided several demanding assumptions are satisfied .",
    "in particular , @xmath4-type ( ga , mn)n would be ferromagnetic with a critical temperature exceeding room temperature .",
    "this implies however the incorporation of 5% of mn into gan , substituting ga in the form of @xmath5 ions , and a strong @xmath4-type doping.@xcite    early experimental works following this prediction did not give any clearcut conclusion about the magnetic properties of ( ga , mn)n : ferromagnetic properties at high temperature,@xcite as well as paramagnetic properties down to low temperature,@xcite have been reported . however , there is now a general agreement that ( ga , mn)n does not offer the configuration which exists in ( ga , mn)as , with the transfer of an electron from the valence band to the @xmath6-levels , resulting in both the @xmath7 configuration ( with a spin 5/2 ) which is observed and the acceptor character of the mn impurity .",
    "ab initio calculations of the band structure@xcite do not exclude the possibility of a ferromagnetic interaction , but they all conclude that the @xmath6  bands of mn are located rather high in the bandgap of gan , although its exact position can not be given .    from an experimental point of view , diverging conclusions have been drawn about the valence state of mn in ( ga , mn)n . in bulk ( ga , mn)n with a very low mn content ,",
    "the @xmath7 state was detected by electron paramagnetic resonance;@xcite in similar samples , the @xmath8 valence state was deduced from magneto - optical measurements upon co - doping with mg.@xcite the mn content in these samples was chosen to be very low , a few @xmath9  @xmath10 at most , so that these two results can be understood from the strong @xmath11-type character of the first samples and the usual acceptor character of mg in gan .",
    "the same @xmath7 state was observed by x - ray absorption spectroscopy at the @xmath12-edge of mn near the surface of layers grown by plasma - assisted molecular beam epitaxy on n - type , sn - doped gan templates,@xcite while we have observed the @xmath8 state by x - ray absorption spectroscopy at the @xmath13-edge of mn in layers grown also by plasma - assisted molecular beam epitaxy but on undoped gan templates.@xcite various types of valence states , from @xmath7 to @xmath14 , were invoked to explain optical spectra of epilayers with a larger mn content.@xcite these results were mainly obtained on ( ga , mn)n with the wurtzite structure : the case of cubic ( ga , mn)n layers appears to be peculiar , since @xmath4-type doping due to the incorporation of manganese was reported,@xcite .",
    "optical absorption spectra@xcite show ( _ i _ ) a structured absorption band in the near infra - red , with a sharp zero - phonon line , which was attributed to the @xmath15 transitions of the mn@xmath0 ion ( the @xmath8 configuration ) , ( _ ii _ ) a broad absorption band attributed to the transitions between the mn levels and the bands of the semiconductor , ( _ iii _ ) absorption at the bandgap of the semiconductor .    the present work is devoted to a magneto - spectroscopic study of ( ga , mn)n samples with a low mn content , so that quite sharp features are observed , and to the evolution of the magnetic and magneto - spectroscopic properties upon increasing the mn content .",
    "main results are a determination of the parameters which enter the effective hamiltonian of the ground level of mn in ( ga , mn)n , which results from a dynamical jahn - teller effect in the @xmath8 configuration of mn , and the observation of spin - carrier coupling through the giant zeeman effect at the bandgap of ( ga , mn)n .",
    "epilayers of wurzite ( ga , mn)n were grown by nitrogen - plasma - assisted molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , on a gan template , previously grown by metal - organic chemical vapor deposition ( mocvd ) on the @xmath16 surface of a sapphire substrate .",
    "a few additional samples were grown on aln templates , so that the substrate is transparent in the vicinity of the bandgap of ( ga , mn)n . unfortunately , the growth had to be initiated with a gan layer , which was kept as thin as possible .",
    "the growth temperature was kept at @xmath17 , which is our usual growth temperature for gan .",
    "a special attention was paid to the different growth regimes related to the ga / n flux ratio and to the manganese flux.@xcite samples were characterized @xmath18  @xmath19 using reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) .",
    "post - growth characterization comprised @xmath20  @xmath19 secondary ion mass spectroscopy ( sims ) and x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) .",
    "optical absorption in the near infrared was measured using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ( ftir ) with a spectral resolution of 0.5  mev , using a tungsten lamp as the light source and a silicon photodetector .",
    "magneto - optical spectroscopy in the near infrared and in the vicinity of the band gap energy was measured using a ccd camera attached to a grating spectrometer .",
    "the magnetic circular dichroism was then calculated from the transmission spectra of right- and left - circular polarized light . in some cases",
    ", it was also measured directly using a 50  khz photoelastic modulator and a photomultiplier tube .",
    "cathodoluminescence was observed in a scanning electron microscope , with the sample placed on a cold finger at 5  k , using an accelerating voltage of 4  kv and a typical current of the order of 30  na .",
    "the luminescence intensity was recorded on a gaas photomultiplier tube attached to a 460  mm spectrometer for imaging , and a charge coupled device ( ccd ) camera for spectroscopy .",
    "attempts to measure the photoluminescence excited by a he - cd laser ( 20  mw on a 50  @xmath21 m spot size ) were unsuccessful .",
    "all the transmission spectra exhibited interference fringes due to internal reflexions between the surface and the sapphire / gan interface .",
    "these interferences were removed using a lineshape fit of the transmittance which includes a @xmath22 function , where @xmath23 is the thickness of the gan + ( ga , mn)n layer , @xmath24 the wavelength , and @xmath11 the optical index of gan at room temperature.@xcite this process is quite efficient in the case of sharp lines , such as the near infrared zero - phonon line , for which the fit can be optimized over a narrow range across the line .",
    "the process is less accurate for broad absorption bands ( broader than 25  mev typically ) , particularly in the vicinity of the bandgap , since we should use the optical index of ( ga , mn)n at low temperature .    magnetization measurements were performed using a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer at magnetic fields up to 5  t applied in the plane of the sample ( @xmath25  axis ) or perpendicular to the plane ( @xmath26 axis ) , at temperatures down to 2  k. the large diamagnetic contribution from the substrate was evaluated on a piece of the same substrate .",
    "in this section , we present the spectroscopic study in the near infrared , including magneto - transmission and cathodoluminescence .",
    "previous transmission spectra have been attributed@xcite to the @xmath27 transition of the @xmath28 configuration of mn , involving a large cubic crystal field splitting , about 1.4  ev .",
    "the better resolution achieved on the present samples with a low mn content , and the comparison between transmission and cathodoluminescence spectra , lead us to reconsider the effective hamiltonian which takes into account the jahn - teller effect and the trigonal crystal field .",
    "[ fig1 ] displays a transmission spectrum and a cathodoluminescence spectrum of a ( ga , mn)n layer with 0.06%  mn . a series of cathodoluminescence spectra were measured locally from different points of the sample .",
    "the one displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is typical of what was obtained from most points ; occasionally , broadened spectra were observed .",
    "the origin of the horizontal scale in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is the common position of the zero - phonon line at 1413  mev , and the scale is inverted for the two spectra .",
    "most features are present on both spectra : they are clearly phonon replica",
    ". they may involve local modes of the mn impurity and its cluster of nearest neighbors , which are expected around 20  mev and 70  mev.@xcite these frequencies are close to high symmetry phonons of gan,@xcite as expected since the difference of mass between mn and ga is small .",
    "the presence of resonances with the phonons of gan makes the spectrum quite complex , but the coupling to the mode at 20  mev dominates , so that a simple model of coupling to a single local mode can be a reasonable approximation .",
    "the coupling to this principal mode is rather weak : the intensity of the zero - phonon line and that of the phonon replica are of the same order of magnitude . in the case of a single local mode , the intensity of the @xmath29 replica to the zero - phonon line",
    "is expected to be @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the so - called huang - rhys factor : from the first replica , we obtain @xmath320.7 from the transmission spectrum , @xmath321.9 from the cathodoluminescence spectrum .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous determinations ( @xmath320.6 in ref .",
    ", @xmath321.1 in ref .  ) . the main contribution to the line at @xmath33__e__=40",
    "mev arises from the second phonon line due to the same mode .",
    "this coupling is much weaker than in the case of cr in ii - vi semiconductors,@xcite which has the same @xmath8 configuration .",
    "then the zero - phonon line is weak ( @xmath34m@xmath35ev / cr in znse,@xcite to be compared to @xmath36m@xmath35ev / mn in gan ) .",
    "the intensity is transferred to a broad vibronic band , three orders of magnitude more intense than the zero - phonon line ( so that the total integrated intensity is about the same in both cases ) .",
    "the huang - rhys factor , as deduced from the position of the maximum of the vibronic band , at @xmath37 from the zero - phonon line , is as high as 13 for cr@xmath38 in znte and 18 in cds .",
    "two lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] can not be ascribed to phonon replica .",
    "the line marked with a diamond in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is present only in the cathodoluminescence spectrum .",
    "it must correspond to a transition to an excited state of the ground @xmath2 multiplet .",
    "another line , marked with a star in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is observed in transmission but not in cathodoluminescence .",
    "its intensity is much lower than that of the zero - phonon line at 1413  mev , and we tentatively ascribe it to a spin - forbidden transition to one of the @xmath39 or @xmath40 levels , which are indeed quite close for such a value of the cubic crystal field.@xcite    fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows a series of transmission spectra in the range of the zero - phonon line , for another sample with a low mn content ( 0.03% ) , for different values of field and temperature , in both the faraday and voigt configurations .",
    "the general features reported by woos _ _ et al.__@xcite are observed , with however a higher resolution .",
    "spectra up to 22  t have been also recorded from the same sample , with a slightly lower resolution ( not shown ) .",
    "two points should be stressed .",
    "first , the zero - field spectrum contains essentially one line : any structure , if present , should be comprised within the observed linewidth of 1.1  mev .",
    "second , the `` shift '' at 7  t reported in ref .   is actually an intensity transfer between two lines labeled _ _ l__1 and _ _ l__2 . from a plot of the positions and intensities deduced from a gaussian fit ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , a third peak @xmath41 appears at intermediate magnetic field , which exhibits a small but systematic shift with respect to @xmath42 .",
    "the appearance of @xmath41 at 3  t , on one hand , and the intensity transfer to @xmath42 observed between 10 and 13  t , on the other hand , indicate two values of the applied field where a crossing takes place in the manifold of ground states .",
    "the relative position of the ground states which serve as initial states for the absorption lines can be deduced from spectra recorded as a function of the temperature for selected values of the magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "for instance , it is clear from the spectra that two lines , at 1411.8  mev and at 1412.8  mev , co - exist even at low temperature at 6  t. at lower fields only one line is seen at 1.7  k and a second line rises on its low energy side at higher temperature ; the opposite is observed at higher fields . a plot of the intensities ( not shown ) is well reproduced by an activation energy with land factors of the order of 2 . as the positions of @xmath43 , @xmath42 and @xmath41 remain almost unchanged ( at most 0.2  mev over a 10  t scan ) , almost identical zeeman shifts occur in both the ground and excited multiplets - which may be accidental , but rather suggests that the spin - orbit coupling is weak .     but the experiments were realized in a different set - up.,width=321 ]        this is supported by the fact that we measure a weak ( although non zero ) magnetic circular dichroism ( mcd ) , @xmath44/[i(\\sigma^{+})+i(\\sigma^{-})]$ ] .",
    "[ fig5]b displays spectra recorded for the two circular polarizations , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , at 11  t and 1.7  k , together with the resulting mcd ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]c ) .",
    "measuring such a small dichroism on a thin layer is difficult .",
    "mcd spectra with a much higher signal - to - noise ratio , obtained on bulk material , are given in ref .  .",
    "the same lineshape is observed at high field , but the mcd persists at lower field in ref .   while we observe a faster decrease and even a trend to a change of sign ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ) .",
    "we shall show now , by constructing an effective hamiltonian , that these spectra are well explained by a _",
    "_ d__@xmath47 configuration , in a crystal field of trigonal symmetry , with a dynamical jahn - teller effect which reduces the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the hamiltonian of a @xmath8 ion contains the crystal field terms ( cubic and trigonal components ) , the spin - orbit coupling , the zeeman effect , the coupling to local strain , and the jahn - teller effect .",
    "the cubic component of the crystal field splits the @xmath48 multiplet into a ground @xmath2 orbital triplet and a @xmath3 orbital doublet ( noted @xmath49 in table i ) .",
    "a basis of orbital states of the triplet adapted to the cubic symmetry is given by the three states @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 which transform like @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 label the cubic axes ; for the doublet , a basis is given by @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "in the case of a wurtzite crystal , there is also a trigonal crystal field .",
    "it has off - diagonal matrix elements in the cubic basis of the orbital triplet and no matrix elements within the doublet . in the case of epitaxial layers grown along the @xmath16 axis",
    ", it may contain a contribution from the biaxial strain due to the partially compensated lattice mismatch .    for the free mn@xmath0 ion , the spin - orbit coupling within the @xmath61__d _ _ multiplet",
    "is written @xmath62 with @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65  11  mev .@xcite in a crystal , this value can be reduced slightly by hybridization , and significantly by the jahn - teller effect ( see below ) .",
    "the coupling to local strain ( `` strain fluctuations '' ) involves trigonal and tetragonal components .",
    "the coupling to trigonal strain , _",
    "i.e. _ , strain components of @xmath66 symmetry , has off - diagonal matrix elements in the cubic basis of the orbital triplet and no matrix elements within the doublet .",
    "the coupling to tetragonal strain , _",
    "i.e. _ , strain components of @xmath67 symmetry , has matrix elements within the triplet ( where they are diagonal ) and the doublet .",
    "finally , there is a jahn - teller coupling of the orbital triplet to @xmath67 and @xmath68 modes , and of the orbital doublet to the @xmath67 modes .",
    "the most simple case of jahn - teller coupling is that of an orbital triplet coupled to a single @xmath67 mode .",
    "a very intuitive treatment , based on first and second order perturbations , was given by ham@xcite .",
    "basically , the orbital triplet is replaced by a vibronic triplet : each orbital state is associated to a potential well with its minimum corresponding to a distortion of the environment along a cubic direction .",
    "the vibronic states are the product of the orbital state by the eigenstates of the displaced harmonic oscillator .",
    "the hamiltonian acting within the orbital triplet , as defined above , is replaced by an effective hamiltonian acting within the vibronic triplet : the main result is that the first - order contribution of off - diagonal operators is reduced by the overlap of eigenstates of the different harmonic oscillators .",
    "first - order contributions of diagonal operators are not reduced .",
    "second - order contributions have to be considered : they are not reduced as the first - order ones so that their role can be enhanced .    in the case of a crystal of cubic symmetry , a strong jahn - teller effect results in a strong reduction of all contributions but that of tetragonal strain fluctuations .",
    "one can use the approximation of the `` static jahn - teller coupling '' : the local tetragonal strain slightly lowers the energy of a well corresponding to a distortion along one of the three cubic directions , and for this ion all calculations are performed with this particular distortion .",
    "this approximation was used in the first study of cr@xmath38 in ii - vi semiconductors,@xcite with the additional assumption that there is no jahn - teller coupling in the @xmath3 excited state .",
    "the same assumption was used later@xcite in the case of cr@xmath38 in cds , which has the wurtzite structure .",
    "more recently @xcite a reasonable agreement with the available data was obtained in the case of mn@xmath0 in gan .    in the present study ,",
    "two points however can not be explained by this model : ( _ i _ ) the presence of a second zero - phonon line in the cathodoluminescence spectrum , and ( _ ii _ ) the observation of a main zero - phonon line at zero field , both in cathodoluminescence and in transmission , with a linewidth of only 1  mev .",
    "spectra calculated within the static limit of the jahn - teller effect ( see fig .  8 of ref .  )",
    "show a doublet which could fit the available spectra with a broad linewidth , but is ruled out by the spectra of the present study ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we could not obtain a better fit with the same model and different parameters .",
    "this leads us to re - examine the treatment of the jahn - teller effect in the case of ( ga , mn)n .    we may note that an improvement of the available spectra for cr@xmath38 in zns and znse recently lead bevilacqua _ _ et al.__@xcite to propose a rather weak jahn - teller coupling to the @xmath68 modes ( and not the @xmath67 mode ) for the orbital triplet , and a stronger coupling to the @xmath67 mode for the orbital doublet ( instead of no coupling ) .",
    "both cases are more difficult to handle , and necessitate a more complete treatment of the vibronic states@xcite which is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "actually , we obtained a reasonable , although not perfect , agreement in the frame of a _ dynamic _ jahn - teller effect for both the triplet and the doublet , and not a static one for cr in ii - vi s .",
    "this is not unexpected for two reasons : ( _ i _ ) the smaller value of the huang - rhys factor suggests that the ham reduction factor@xcite should be smaller ( this is but a hint , since the huang - rhys factor measured on spectra involves a vibrational overlap between a distorted harmonic oscillator of the triplet and a distorted harmonic oscillator of the doublet , while the reduction factors involve an overlap between two different harmonic oscillators of two states of the same multiplet ) ; ( _ ii _ ) the trigonal crystal field due to the wurtzite structure tends to mix the three cubic states and , even if it is reduced by the jahn - teller effect , it may remain larger than the tetragonal component of strain fluctuations ( which tends to stabilize one cubic distortion ) .",

    "we assume that strain fluctuations have a negligible effect .",
    "the case of the jahn - teller effect in the doublet is more complicated .",
    "the full treatment for cr@xmath38 in zns and znse@xcite concludes that there is a significant jahn - teller effect , and that the excited levels which contribute to the absorption lines are comprised within a narrow energy range ( less than 0.3  mev ) .",
