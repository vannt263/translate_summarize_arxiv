    "linear systems of equations with a matrix with a toeplitz - type structure arise in many applications , such as in signal and image processing . consider the computation of an approximate solution of the linear system of equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a symmetric bttb matrix , i.e.",
    ", @xmath1 is a symmetric block toeplitz matrix with each block being an @xmath2 symmetric toeplitz matrix .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath1 are assumed to decay smoothly to zero in magnitude without a significant gap . in particular",
    ", @xmath1 may be singular .",
    "linear systems of equations ( [ linsys ] ) with a matrix of this kind arise , for example , from the discretization of a linear ill - posed problem , such as a fredholm integral equation of the first kind in two space - dimensions with a displacement kernel .",
    "the right - hand side @xmath3 of ( [ linsys ] ) is assumed to be contaminated by an ( unknown ) error @xmath4 .",
    "we will refer to this error as `` noise '' .",
    "it may stem from measurement or discretization errors .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the ( unknown ) error - free vector associated with @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath7 the ( unknown ) linear system of equations with error - free right - hand side , @xmath8 is assumed to be consistent ; however , we do not require the available system ( [ linsys ] ) to be consistent .",
    "we will assume that a fairly sharp bound for the norm of @xmath4 is known , i.e. , @xmath9 here and throughout this paper @xmath10 denotes the euclidean vector norm or the spectral matrix norm .",
    "this bound will help us determine a suitable number of iterations to carry out with a minimal residual iterative method and to construct a preconditioner for the solution of .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the moore ",
    "penrose pseudoinverse of @xmath1 .",
    "we are interested in computing an approximation of the solution @xmath12 of minimal euclidean norm of the unavailable error - free linear system ( [ linsysnf ] ) .",
    "note that the solution of ( [ linsys ] ) , @xmath13 typically is dominated by the propagated error @xmath14 and , therefore , is useless .",
    "therefore all solution methods for seek to determine a suitable approximate solution that is not severely contaminated by propagated error .",
    "the computed approximate solution is the exact solution of an appropriately chosen nearby problem , whose solution is less sensitive to the error @xmath4 in @xmath3 than the solution of .",
    "the replacement of the given problem by a nearby problem is commonly referred to as regularization . among the most popular regularization methods",
    "is tikhonov regularization , which replaces by a penalized least - squares problem , and truncated iteration , which is based on solving by an iterative method and terminating the iterations suitably early , see , e.g. , @xcite for discussions on these regularization methods . in this paper",
    "we regularize by truncated iteration , and by choosing a suitable preconditioner .",
    "the evaluation of matrix - vector products with a bttb matrix of order @xmath15 can be carried out in only @xmath16 arithmetic floating point operations ( flops ) by using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this makes it attractive to solve by an iterative method .",
    "we will use a preconditioner to increase the rate of convergence of the iterative method .",
    "are commonly preconditioned by block circulant with circulant block ( bccb ) matrices ; see @xcite for discussions , illustrations , and further references .",
    "the use of bccb preconditioners for bttb matrices is attractive both due to the spectral properties of the preconditioned matrix and because of the possibility to evaluate a matrix - vector product with a preconditioned matrix of order @xmath15 in only @xmath16 flops with the aid of the fft .",
    "a matlab software package for fast matrix - vector product evaluation is provided by redivo ",
    "zaglia and rodriguez @xcite .    when preconditioning a bttb matrix @xmath1 that stems from the discretization of a linear ill - posed problem , it is desirable that an invariant subspace associated with the eigenvalues of @xmath1 of smallest magnitude is not affected by preconditioning to avoid severe propagation of the error @xmath4 in the right - hand side @xmath3 of ( [ linsys ] ) into the computed iterates .",
    "this is due to the fact that the eigenvectors associated with these eigenvalues are highly oscillatory ( have many sign changes ) and model noise rather than the desired solution @xmath17 .",
    "typically , we do not want these eigenvectors to be part of our computed approximation of @xmath17 .",
    "a nice introduction to bccb preconditioners for the solution of discretized linear ill - posed problems with a toeplitz - type matrix is presented by hanke et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the number of iterations have to be few enough to avoid severe propagation of the error @xmath4 in @xmath3 into the computed approximation of @xmath17 .",
    "the availability of the bound and the consistency of allow us to apply the discrepancy principle to determine a suitable number of iterations as well as to define the dimension of the invariant subspace that should not be affected by the preconditioner .",
    "roughly , the larger the error in @xmath3 , the larger should the dimension of the subspace that is not ( or only minimally ) affected by preconditioning be chosen .",
    "various other approaches to define bccb preconditioners for the iterative solution of discretized linear ill - posed problems with an error - contaminated right - hand side are described in the literature .",
    "for instance , hanke and nagy @xcite apply the l - curve criterion to determine a subspace that should not be affected by the preconditioner .",
    "the l - curve criterion implicitly estimates the norm of the error in @xmath3 .",
    "this criterion is able to estimate the norm of the error fairly accurately in some situations , but it is not a reliable error estimator ; see @xcite for discussions and illustrations .",
    "we therefore are interested in developing an approach for constructing bccb preconditioners that is not based on the l - curve criterion .",
    "hanke et al .",
    "@xcite apply a discrete picard condition to determine the dimension of the subspace that the bccb preconditioner should leave invariant .",
    "this approach typically works quite well in an interactive computing environment that allows the determination of whether the discrete picard condition holds by visual inspection , however , it is not straightforward to automatize . di benedetto et al . @xcite",
    "propose the application of a so - called superoptimal bccb preconditioner and do not explicitly choose the dimension of the subspace that should be unaffected by the preconditioner .",
    "this approach works well for some image restoration problems , but not for others ; see the discussion in @xcite .",
    "preconditioning is most useful when the error @xmath4 in @xmath3 is of small relative norm , because then many steps of an iterative method may be required to determine an accurate approximation of @xmath17 . when the error @xmath4 is large , only few steps can be carried out before the propagated error destroys the computed solution .",
    "preconditioning then does not reduce the computational effort by much .    in this paper",
    ", we will use the bound ( [ errbd ] ) to determine both the bccb preconditioner and the number of iterations to be carried out .",
    "a perturbation bound guides our choice of preconditioner .",
    "this is described in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "a few computed examples are presented in section [ sec3 ] and concluding remarks can be found in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "we discuss the construction of the preconditioner , the stopping criterion for the iterative method , and outline the minimal residual iterative methods used .",
    "let for the moment @xmath18 be a symmetric positive definite toeplitz matrix and let @xmath19 be the closest circulant matrix to @xmath1 in the frobenius norm .",
    "t. chan @xcite proposed the use of @xmath20 as a preconditioner for @xmath1 ; see also @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath20 are given by the discrete fourier transform of the first column of @xmath20 ; their computation with the fft requires only @xmath21 flops .",
    "since we would like the preconditioner not to affect the invariant subspace of @xmath1 associated with the smallest eigenvalues , we set the @xmath22 eigenvalues of smallest magnitude of @xmath20 to unity for some suitable @xmath23 , analogously as in @xcite .",
    "we refer to this preconditioner as @xmath24 .",
    "subsection [ sub2.4 ] describes how to determine @xmath25 using the error bound .    the linear systems ( [ linsys ] ) of interest to us have a bttb matrix @xmath1 , i.e.",
    ", @xmath1 is the kronecker product of two toeplitz matrices @xmath26 we will determine a preconditioner that is the kronecker product of two circulant matrices @xmath27 where @xmath28 is defined by first determining the closest circulant @xmath29 to @xmath30 in the frobenius norm and then setting its @xmath31 eigenvalues of smallest magnitude to one for @xmath32 . in this way",
    "our preconditioner @xmath20 does not affect the invariant subspace of @xmath1 associated with the eigenvalues of smallest magnitude .",
    "the eigenvectors of this subspace are highly oscillatory and primarily model noise and not the desired solution @xmath17 .",
    "this construction of @xmath20 requires only @xmath33 flops .",
    "we refer to the bccb preconditioner so determined as @xmath34 .",
    "the determination of this preconditioner is somewhat faster than of the bccb preconditioner described in @xcite , because the latter requires that all its @xmath15 eigenvalues be formed .",
    "once the bccb preconditioner @xmath34 has been defined , we compute an approximate solution @xmath35 of the preconditioned linear system of equations , @xmath36 using one of the minimal residual iterative methods described in subsection [ sub2.6 ] . as for the initial approximation of @xmath17 , define the bccb matrix @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is obtained from @xmath29 by setting the @xmath31 eigenvalues of smallest magnitude to zero , for @xmath32 , and define @xmath39 the initial iterate then is chosen to be @xmath40 .",
