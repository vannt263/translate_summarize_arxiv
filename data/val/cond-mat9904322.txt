    "the principles of thermodynamics were established in the last century as the universal laws characterizing the thermal and mechanical behavior of macroscopic systems .",
    "the fact that we can not control all the details of energy transfer leads to the concept of _ heat _ as a form of energy flow , and the _ carnot cycle _ has played a crucial role in the course of investigation leading to the introduction of entropy as a state variable in addition to energy@xcite . on the other hand , brownian motion and the stochastic dynamics of mesoscopic systems in general have also been studied for many years , and projection methods have allowed for the derivation of langevin dynamics from microscopic hamiltonian mechanics . in a properly defined langevin equation ,",
    "the influence of the unpredictable microscopic dynamics , which essentially represent the heat , is taken into account by markovian random forces obeying the fluctuation - dissipation relationship . in this manner",
    ", such an equation describes the canonical equilibrium distribution of the variables in question@xcite .",
    "very recently , the concept of the heat on mesoscopic scales has been unambiguously defined in terms of langevin dynamics@xcite .",
    "we refer to the formalism providing this definition as _",
    "stochastic energetics_.the essential point of the thinking behind this formalism is that the heat transfered to the system is nothing but the microscopic work done by both frictional forces _ and _ the random force in the langevin equation .",
    "the theoretical framework resulting from this realization widens the scope of application of langevin dynamics to the extent that it can be used to describe not merely equilibrium states of system in contact with heat baths , but also general thermodynamic _ processes _ connecting different equilibrium states . as a result",
    ", we can derive the first and the second laws of thermodynamics@xcite from stochastic energetics .",
    "this formalism , together with projection methods , bridge a longstanding gap between microscopic hamiltonian mechanics and macroscopic thermodynamics . in this paper",
    "we apply the method of stochastic energetics to the investigation of the carnot cycle in the context of small systems . to make this paper",
    "self - contained , we briefly summarize the framework of stochastic energetics in   [ sec : steng ] .",
    "stochastic energetics has also been applied to the study of thermodynamic processes under non - equilibrium conditions , such as processes including two heat baths@xcite and processes in the presence of steadily driving forces@xcite . in particular ,",
    "feynman s ratchet model@xcite has been analyzed . regarding this model ,",
    "the doubt has been cast by parrondo@xcite , and later by sekimoto@xcite independently , about the attainability of reversible energy conversion with the ` carnot efficiency ' @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the temperatures of cool and hot heat baths .",
    "analysis using stochastic energetics has shown explicitly that the efficiency of feynman s ratchet is much less than that of the carnot efficiency mentioned above@xcite .      with the descriptive power of stochastic energetics in hand",
    ", we wish to reconsider the carnot cycle .",
    "we consider the carnot cycle as an _ object _ of analysis within the theoretical framework of stochastic energetics .",
    "note that since we can derive the laws of thermodynamics directly using the stochastic energetics based on the langevin description , the role of the carnot cycle in our study is _ not _ a source of theoretical results from which one derives the laws of thermodynamics as was its historical role .",
    "( of course both the langevin description and thermodynamics have a microscopic basis in mechanics . )",
    "we now describe our viewpoint in more detail . usually the carnot heat engine is considered in an ideally macroscopic context , working in the thermodynamic limit . there",
    ", the small relative fluctuations of the variables , typically on the order of the inverse square root of the system size , are neglected .",
    "also , the cost involved in the operations of attaching / detaching the system under study to / from heat baths is neglected , since this is not an the extensive quantity .",
    "it is important to notice that the second law of thermodynamics , which is consistent with such a macroscopic carnot engine , can exclude _ only marginally _ the existence of perpetual machine of the second kind whose cycles yield positive work in an isothermal environment .",
    "thus we may gain a deeper insight into the nature of statistical thermodynamics and mechanics if we can formulate a method to take account of the finiteness of the the system under study as well as the cost involved in operations of changing its interaction with heat baths , in particular considering reversibility and the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the approach of the present work is to construct the simplest model of the carnot heat engine with a finite number ( actually only three ) of degrees of freedom , including the apparatus connecting / disconnecting it with heat baths , and to determine the effect of the finiteness of the system and the change resulting from operations of the type mentioned above .",
    "as the system of study ( or the ` working material ' ) we choose a single harmonic oscillator . we show that there is an inevitable source of dissipation due to the _ intrinsically _ irreversible nature of the operations of connecting and disconnecting it with heat baths , and that , with the exception of such loss , our model can attain the carnot maximal efficiency defined as a properly defined average over infinitely many cycles , each of which is performed infinitely slowly . at the same time this study reveals several basic problems which should be further scrutinized in the future",
    ": one regards the smooth connection between the adiabatic process and the isothermal processes , and the other regards the irreversibility of adiabatic processes . in the last section we discuss these problems as well as the problem involving energy conversion with no help from external operations .",
    "in the remaining part of this section we give a qualitative description of the aspects of the carnot cycle that we study in detail in the later sections .",
    "the operations of connection to and disconnection from the heat bath .",
    "+ we ask first how we can describe _ mechanically _ the connection and disconnection of the system with the heat baths . in an idealized picture ,",
    "this basically consists of the switching on and off of the interaction between the system and each heat bath . in   [ sec : model ] we describe explicitly a model that realizes these operations .",
    "we represent the influence of the heat baths by a frictional force and the random force of a langevin equation , and we control the strength of the coupling between the system and the heat baths by controlling the values of the corresponding interaction potentials .",
    "we call these interaction potentials ` couplers ' .",
    "( in an actual mechanical system , the control of such a coupler could be exercised by a system of clutches . )",
    "one could also imagine such control exercised through the change of the friction constants that appear in the langevin equation .",
    "in consideration of the absence of a definition of the required work to change these friction constants , however , this idea is not pursued in the present paper . .",
    "+ _ 2._the reversible and irreversible work of operating the couplers + the operation of the couplers can , _ in principle _",
    ", never be carried out quasi - statically , but , at the same time , that accompanying irreversible work can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "the former part of this assertion is based on the following argument : when the interaction between the system and a heat bath is strong , the energy transfer between them occurs with a short relaxation time .",
    "however , if we gradually weaken this interaction , this relaxation time increases more and more until it diverges when the system is completely detached from the heat bath .",
    "as long as the time - scale of the operation ( i.e. the switching - off ) is finite , this operation can never remain ` slow ' in comparison to the diverging relaxation time .",
    "thus the switching - off process is by no means quasi - static , or quasi - equilibrium .",
    "( this is analogous to the non - adiabaticity encountered in chemical reactions ; the born - oppenheimer approximation is inevitably invalid when the distance between nuclei is neither sufficiently large nor sufficiently small . )",
    "inevitable irreversibility can also exist in the process of strengthening the interaction between the system and the heat bath .",
    "such extreme strengthening of the interaction leads to the freezing of some degree(s ) of freedom involved in the interaction , and the mean first - passage time associated with these degrees of freedom may become larger than the timescale of the operation ( i.e. the strengthening ) . in such a situation also , the operation can never be carried out quasi - statically .",
    "unlike the switching - off process , however , the indefinite strengthening of the interaction is not necessarily a part of the carnot cycle .",
    "despite this fact , we consider the latter process in the sections that follow , because this allows us to minimize the calculations needed to reach a general conclusion .",
    "we should , however , note that the inevitably irreversibile nature of the operations described above does not necessarily imply an associated large amount of irreversible work . in ",
    "[ sec : clutch ] we analyze the work involved in operating the coupler and show that the amount of irreversible work resulting from these inevitably irreversible operations can be made arbitrarily small in the limit that the timescale of the operation becomes large .",
    "we also show that the reversible part of the work associated with these operations remains finite in this limit , but that it cancels out within a cycle .",
    "+ _ 3._the condition for reversible contact between the system and a heat bath + temporarily putting aside the concept of irreversibility in the sense described in 2 above , we can scrutinize the remaining part of the cycle and ask if and how the carnot maximum efficiency can be attained .",
    "with regard to a macroscopic carnot cycle , according to textbook descriptions , in order to realize a reversible cycle , ` the temperature of the system should be the same as that of the heat bath with which the system is to make contact after an adiabatic process . ' strictly speaking , however , the energy , rather than the temperature , takes a definite value in a thermally isolated system , and the above statement needs to be refined in terms of the language of probability .",
    "we argue in   [ sec : match ] that reversible contact requires the probability distribution of the energy of the system just before interaction with a heat bath to be identical to the canonical distribution at the temperature of the heat bath",
    ". this condition can be satisfied if the system consists of harmonic oscillators , as the model described below . generally , however , this is not the case , and in the general situation an irreversible process takes place when system contacts the heat bath , even though there occurs no net irreversible energy transfer between the two (   [ subsec:1 ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec : efficiencymax ] we summarize the necessary conditions for carnot cycle to realize the maximal efficiency @xmath3 without assuming the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we show at the same time that this actually is the case for the model described in   [",
    "sec : model ] .",
    "_ statistics of the efficiency of a finite number of cycles + the efficiency of the energy conversion of an _ individual _ cycle is statistically distributed , because the energy possessed by the system is different each time the system is disconnected from a heat bath .",
    "this fact reflects the indeterminate nature of the details of the microscopic states of the system and of the heat bath upon disconnection.as a consequence , if we define the cumulative ` bonus ' work as the difference between the cumulative work obtained over @xmath4 cycles and what we would expect from the carnot maximal efficiency , this bonus work takes the form of a discrete random walk as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "we show in   [ sec : efficiency ] and the appendix that the so - called null - recurrence property of a one - dimensional random walk insures that , although , if we actually carry out a sequence of these cycles , the cumulative bonus work we obtain will with probability 1 first become positive after a finite number of repetitions @xmath5 , the statistical average of @xmath5 is infinite .",
    "_ irreversibility of adiabatic processes + the carnot cycle includes an adiabatic process that is purely mechanical .",
    "we are interested in determining what work can be obtained through the cycle including _ non_-quasi - static adiabatic processes .",
    "if the efficiency in this case is increased in comparison to the quasi - static case , the existence of a perpetual machine of the second kind is inspired , because our carnot cycle can attain the maximal ( reversible limit ) efficiency under certain conditions specified in ",
    "[ sec : efficiencymax ] . in ",
    "[ subsec : adiab ] we show that , in relation to the impossibility of a perpetual machine , there emerges the concept of the irreversibility of purely mechanical processes ( with no assumption of the thermodynamic limit or mixing properties necessary ) under the influence of ` macroscopic ' operations by an external agent . here",
    ", designation of an operation as ` macroscopic ' implies that ( i ) we are ignorant of the initial phase point on a given energy surface , and ( ii ) we are interested only in the statistical average over such an initial ensemble at a given energy .",
    "we consider a langevin equation that represents a system in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath6 , @xmath7 here we denote by @xmath8 and @xmath9 the dynamical variable of the system and its conjugate momentum , while @xmath10 represents the mass , @xmath11 the friction constant , and @xmath12 the potential energy for @xmath8 .",

    "multiplication of each term in the second equation in ( [ eq : langevin2 ] ) by the displacement @xmath17 yields the equation@xcite @xmath18 where we have used the first equation of eq.([eq : langevin2 ] ) and also the identity @xmath19 .",
    "we note that @xmath20 is the _ reaction _ force exerted by the system against the heat bath , since the frictional force @xmath21 and the random force @xmath14 are both due to the heat bath .",
    "we identify the work done by the reaction force as the _ heat _ transferred from the system to the heat bath , which we denote by @xmath22@xcite : @xmath23 ( the minus sign in front of @xmath24 is included to conform to the convention of thermodynamics textbooks . )",
    "the key point of introducing the concept of heat is that , although the heat bath is idealized and not affected by the system s dynamics , the heat bath can still be subject to a reaction force exerted by the system . adding the total differential @xmath25 to both sides of eq.([eq : balance2 ] ) , we obtain the general expression for the _ energy balance _ as @xmath26 now , because the l.h.s .",

    "in which @xmath31 is arbitrarily small , the work is reversible and is equal to the change in the helmholtz free energy @xmath32 with probability 1 .",

    "thus we obtain the energy distribution of a canonical ensemble _ after _ the change in @xmath51 , @xmath177 with @xmath178 being defined by @xmath179 .",
    "however , we note that this simple situation is due to the special nature of the harmonic oscillator system . the general case is discussed in   [ subsec:1 ] .",

    "( 2 ) : :    the temperature characterizing this canonical ensemble must be the    same as that of the heat bath in question .",

    "we now evaluate the maximal overall efficiency . we must take into account ( i ) the operation of the couplers , ( ii ) the isothermal processes , and ( iii ) the adiabatic processes .",

    "the accompanying work and heat flow cancel exactly when summed over an infinite number of consecutive connection and disconnection with the heat bath ( see eqs.([eq : workadbc ] ) and ( [ eq : heatadbc ] ) ) .",

    "the heat influx from the high temperature heat bath is evaluated as follows . while the work during the isothermal quasi - equilibrium processes is a non - fluctuating quantity ( see eq.([eq : second0 ] ) ) , both the energy influx from the heat bath and the system s energy fluctuate subject to the constraint of energy balance described by eq.([eq : balance ] ) . from eqs.([eq : clutchf ] ) and ( [ eq : etildef ] ) we can show that the average internal energy of the composite system with degrees of freedom @xmath130 is independent of the parameter @xmath51 .",

    "in the situation we consider , we have seen that some parts of the cycle can never be carried out quasi - statically , due to the intrinsically irreversible operation of the couplers (   [ sec : clutch ] ) , as well as the intrinsic irreversibility resulting from the non - canonical energy distribution of the systems caused by the adiabatic processes(  [ sec : match ] ) .",
    "the maximal efficiency eq.([eq : etamax ] ) obtained above represents exclusively the ratio of the total work done by the system to the total energy influx from the high temperature heat bath through infinite number of cycles . here",
    "we consider the efficiency for a single cycle , @xmath216 , which can be written as @xmath217 with @xmath218 and @xmath219 we first note several properties of @xmath220    _ 1 .",

    "such a situation can result through fluctuations , and it is not in contradiction with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "we may then , however , ask how many cycles on average we must carry out before we first obtain a cumulative excess output , @xmath232 , where @xmath233 is the excess output of the @xmath234-th cycle and @xmath4 is the total number of consecutive cycles .",

    "this , of course , would be in contradiction with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "a pitfall of this false argument is that , although for a given sequence of cycles , the condition @xmath236 will be satisfied at some finite @xmath4 with probability 1 , the _ average _ over separate sequences of the smallest value of @xmath4 with positive @xmath235 is divergent .",
    "this fact is closely related to the fact that the one - dimensional random walk is ` null - recurrent ' ( see appendix  [ sec : nullrecurrent ] ) .",
    "in   [ sec : match ] we have used the fact that for the harmonic oscillator system , as a result of the quasi - static adiabatic process , the energy changes in such a manner that the energy distribution remains in canonical form , with simply a change of the temperature , @xmath237 .",

    "when an ensemble of systems following the distribution @xmath239 are brought into ( weak ) contact with a heat bath of arbitrary temperature @xmath178 , the energy distribution _ irreversibly _ relaxes to the canonical form @xmath240 .",
    "this is the case even if @xmath178 is chosen so that @xmath241 , i.e. even in the case that no net heat is transferred on the average from the bath to the system .",

    "the adiabatic process in the carnot cycle is a mechanical process .",
    "the ergodic invariant theorem@xcite tells us that under quasi - static and adiabatic change of a system parameter , say @xmath13 , by a finite amount , the phase volume enclosed by the energy surface defined by the system s energy at each moment , @xmath242 ( see ( [ eq : defj ] ) for definition ) , remains constant .",
    "the theorem does not assume the thermodynamic limit nor the presence or absence of chaotic trajectories .",
    "contrastingly , for a non - quasi - static process @xmath242 can either increase or decrease , depending on both the nature of the change of @xmath13 and the initial conditions of the system .    in the context of the present paper , however , it is most meaningful to confine ourselves to only ` macroscopic ' external operations , excluding ` demonic ' ones which depend on detailed information of the system .",
    "more precisely , we focus on an unprejudiced choice of the initial conditions among those with a given energy , and also focus only on statistical averages of the energy , rather than consider particular results obtained from particular initial conditions .",
    "sato@xcite has recently studied a harmonic oscillator under a time - dependent force , @xmath243 , as the simplest non - trivial example of a system with only macroscopic external operations . here ,",
    "the change of @xmath46 amounts to a horizontal displacement of the potential .",
    "he showed analytically , as one can easily confirm , that for an arbitrary function @xmath46 , the energy of the oscillator , @xmath244 , is strictly non - decreasing _ if _ the average is taken with respect to the initial condition over all initial conditions represented by states with a given energy , i.e. , over a micro - canonical ensemble . only in the limit of a quasi - static process",
    "@xmath245 is the energy unchanged .",
    "this example demonstrates the irreversibility of a mechanical system of non - macroscopic size with properly defined macroscopic operation .",
    "a recent numerical work@xcite investigating a harmonic oscillator with time - dependent spring constant , @xmath246 , reveals the same phenomena when @xmath247 is constrained to return to its initial value . in the present context of the analysis of the efficiency of carnot cycle (   [ sec : efficiencygen ] ) , these findings are both natural and important , since , if the case were different , one could find functional form for @xmath247 for which the adiabatic work on the system would be less than what we expect for a quasi - static process , and the whole cycle could be used to construct a perpetual machine of the second kind .",
    "( note that in the analysis of ",
    "[ sec : efficiencygen ] we have excluded only marginally the existence of such a perpetual machine if the loss due to the other sources is made arbitrarily small . ) it is desirable to obtain a general proof ( or counter - evidence ) of the irreversibility resulting from non - quasi - static processes . a related analysis using path probabilities has been performed for chaotic systems@xcite .",
    "however , we suspect that the essential mechanism of the irreversibility related to the characterization of macroscopic operators , which are ignorant of the initial microscopic state of the system , can be elucidated without resort to chaotic statistics . it is also a future problem to scrutinize the case in which the topology of the energy contour surface in the phase space ( @xmath248 ) changes at some parameter value ,",
    "say @xmath249 .",
    "in such cases , quasi - static processes can not be extended across @xmath249@xcite .",
    "as in the case of the ordinary macroscopic carnot cycle , we have introduced control parameters , @xmath250 .",
    "we assumed that the values of these parameters are changed by some external agent whose dynamics are external to the equation of motion of the system .",
    "in fact , however , there are many ` self - controlled ' energy transducers which contain their own control systems . in such cases ,",
    "the identification of the control system is more or less a matter of interpretation . in the macroscopic world , dc electric motors and steam engines are examples , while motor proteins , such as myosins , kinesins and dyneins , etc . , are microscopic examples .",
    "theoretically , the so - called feynman ratchet and pawl system@xcite has been proposed as a microscopic energy transducer working by itself between hot and cool heat baths . in this model ,",
    "the role of the control system is played either by the pawl or by the ratchet , depending on which of these two is in direct contact with the cool heat bath .",
    "the stochastic energetics of this model have been analyzed@xcite .",

    "a massive particle moves while in contact with a heat bath of position - dependent temperature , @xmath251 or @xmath1 . in this model ,",
    "the inertia of the particle serves to switch the particle s environment from @xmath204 to @xmath203 , or vice versa .",
