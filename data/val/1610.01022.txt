    "examining collisions between bright solitons introduces an extra parameter , namely the relative phase . while these solitons collide freely in one dimension , numerical simulations @xcite have demonstrated that in - phase collisions promote the collapse of the condensate in three dimensions , while a relative phase of @xmath0 suppresses the collapse",

    "the error bars represent the standard deviation . for low values of @xmath45",
    ", the value of @xmath86 follows very closely the value obtained in the absence of noise .",
    "this is attributed to the elastic dynamics being insensitive to the phase noise . on the other hand , for stronger dipolar interactions",
    ", there is a marked deviation from the no - noise case , resulting in a larger value of @xmath86 . in this regime , the presence of noise introduces an apparent repulsion between the solitons , which is large enough to make the collisions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise ] elastic .",
    "such an effect has also also been noted in non - dipolar bright soliton collisions @xcite .",
    "we see qualitatively the same behaviour for different strengths of noise , with increasing amounts of noise causing the bound - states to break sooner , until no bound - states are formed .",
    "a corollary of the phase noise is that the bound state dynamics in the presence of noise show fewer oscillations before escaping their bind .",
    "this effect is illustrated in the soliton trajectories with / without noise in insets fig .",
    "[ fig : noise ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the presence of only small amounts of noise demonstrates how sensitive the binding dynamics are : fig .",
    "[ fig : noise ] ( b ) illustrates that only one oscillation can occur in this example before the solitons escape . for larger amounts of noise the bound states are no longer present , event at these larger values of @xmath45 .",
    "on the other hand , the collsions for out - of - phase solitons , in contrast , are insensitve to noise .",
    "the effective repulsion in these collisions serves to stabilize the collisions against the noise .",
    "although the analysis presented here is rudimentary , it nonetheless allows one to comment on the effect of dissipative processes that are present in a real system , especially those at finite temperature .",
    "for example , for small changes in temperature , it is expected that the formation of bound states would be unfavorable .",
    "the dipolar interactions would play an increasingly diminished role in the system dynamics , since this term fundamentally depends on the condensate density , which is reduced due to the presence of the non - condensate @xcite .",
    "a repercussion of attractive interactions between particles is that , for sufficiently large number of particles and/or interaction strength , the mean - field wave function of a 3d condensate is unstable to collapse . for systems possessing only short - ranged isotropic van der waals type interactions , the critical point of collapse",

    "these regions are found in both the @xmath20 parts of the parameter space .",
    "alternatively for @xmath20 , ( bottom right and top left quadrants ) the dipoles repel each other in the head - to - tail arrangement , which precludes the bright soliton from collapsing .",
    "instead , one can have a runaway expansion , where the repulsive nature of the dipoles overcomes any attractive forces present .",
    "interestingly , the solutions in these two quadrants do not continue indefinitely , but rather terminate at a point , as indicated by red circles .",
    "contour plots of the energy surfaces found from eqs .  - in the @xmath155 parameter space accompany fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] ( c ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] ( a ) and ( b ) . figure [ fig : stab ] ( a ) shows a typical energy contour in a region where the hessian @xmath148 , i.e. a saddle point . meanwhile , a typical ` bowl ' configuration that the energy takes in stable regions of the @xmath156 parameter space is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] ( b ) .",
    "this particular plot shows a stable minima indicative of regions where the bright soliton is stable .",
    "figure [ fig : stab ] ( d ) shows a shaded plot of the stable regions where one can expect a bright soliton to form . in comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] ( c ) , the two regions with @xmath148 ( @xmath20 ) have been removed , showing how the stable regions are bound by the collapse or runaway expansion curves ( solid red ) . for @xmath73 condensation occurs with @xmath157 , giving a three - dimensional character to the solitons in these regions of the parameter space . for @xmath20",
    "however , one finds instead that @xmath158 , indicative of a very elongated ( cigar ) like cloud .",
    "here the solitons exist closer to the one - dimensional limit .",
    "finally , we note that close to the unstable boundary ( red lines ) the bright soliton can pass through a region where @xmath159 .",
    "such states would be challenging to observe , as the the system would preferentially wish to collapse due to the presence of thermal or quantum fluctuations .",
    "although our presented results only consider a particular choice of dipole polarization , one can still comment on the stability of the dipolar bright soliton when the dipoles are , say , polarized perpendicular to the axis of the waveguide . as was noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : dbs ] , altering the polarization of the dipoles from @xmath48 to @xmath49 has the effect of swapping the regimes of @xmath45 where one obtains bright soliton solutions .",
    "we can speculate that a similar effect would occur when examining the stability of the dipolar system , except here we would see the regions associated with collapse and runaway expansion switch .",
    "however , this case breaks cylindrical symmetry , requiring a fully anisotropic ansatz to capture the stability of the system .",
    "this greatly complicates the analysis , as one has three variational width parameters to consider .",
    "we have analysed the solutions , quasi - one - dimensional dynamics and full three - dimensional stability of dipolar bright solitons .",
    "the bright soliton solutions obtained from the dipolar gross - pitaevskii equation exhibit a number of novel features , including collisions which have regimes of elastic behavior , bound state formation and soliton fusion .",
    "these regimes where shown to depend sensitively on the dipolar interactions and the presence of noise , which modify the phase shifts of the solitons .",
    "we quantified the collisional behaviour in terms of the coefficient of restitution .",
    "analysis of soliton dynamics in terms of the coefficient of restitution could then provide important insight for systems where the full scattering phase shifts may be difficult to obtain analytically .",
    "the stability of the full three - dimensional dipolar system was explored ; in particular it emerged that the dipolar interactions can destabilize the bright soliton in two distinct ways , either through a traditional collapse , or instead through a runaway expansion along the axis . for axially - polarized dipoles",
    "the former occurs when the dipole - dipole interaction is positive , while the later is associated with regimes of anti - dipoles for which the dipole - dipole interaction is instead negative .",
    "our results provide a benchmark for future experimental studies of nonlocal soliton in dipolar condensates . in turn",
    ", this system offers unique opportunities to explore the fundamental properties of nonlocal solitons in general with the immense tunability of atomic physics .",
