    "in the present paper , diffractive hadron leptoproduction for a longitudinally polarized lepton and a transversely polarized proton at high energies has been studied within the two - gluon exchange model .",
    "the polarized cross sections of diffractive hadron production are determined in terms of the leptonic and hadronic tensors and the squared amplitude of hadron production through the photon - two - gluon fusion .",

    "it might be an excellent object to study transverse effects in the proton coupling with gluons .",
    "however , the experimental study of this asymmetry is not so simple . to find nonzero asymmetry in this case ,",
    "it is necessary to distinguish quark and antiquark jets and to have a possibility to study the azimuthal asymmetry structure .",
    "this is an important condition , because the polarized cross section integrated over @xmath258 is equal to zero .",
    "note that the asymmetry of the same order of magnitude was predicted for diffractive @xmath0 production in polarized proton- proton interaction @xcite .",
    "the second term @xmath242 in the @xmath1 asymmetry of @xmath0 production is related to the diffractive contribution to the @xmath259 asymmetry .",

    "all these results should be applicable to the reactions with heavy quarks . for processes with light quarks ,",
    "our predictions can be used in the small @xmath13 region ( @xmath262 e.g. ) where the contribution of quark spd is expected to be small .",
    "now , we have no the definite predictions for the @xmath263 asymmetry in light vector meson production . including the transverse quark motion and higher twist effects for transversely polarized @xmath218 meson might be important in asymmetry . in the region of not small @xmath264 in the hermes experiments",
