    "a supersolid is characterized by a non - trivial solid order parameter which co - exists with an off - diagonal long - range superfluid order parameter.@xcite this state appears counter - intuitive since the superfluid density implies ballistic coherent transport without disturbing the ordered background of the solid .",
    "the possibility of a supersolid was discussed in the early 1970 s and since then much attention has been focused on @xmath0he as the most likely experimental realization , which remains controversial.@xcite the motions of many different kinds of defects have been considered as possible mechanisms for supersolidity in @xmath0he , including vacancies,@xcite grain boundaries @xcite or dislocations @xcite which may be able to move through a solid state . in recent years supersolid behavior on lattices has been established theoretically in a number of interacting boson models,@xcite which now gives hope for an experimental realization of a supersolid with the help of ultra - cold gases.@xcite one prototypical example to exhibit a supersolid phase are hard - core bosons with nearest neighbor repulsion on a triangular lattice @xcite which are described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 @xmath3 is the boson creation ( annihilation ) operator , @xmath4 describes the hopping amplitude , @xmath5 is the chemical potential , @xmath6 reflects the repulsion effect , and @xmath7 represents nearest - neighbor sites .    for positive hopping @xmath8",
    "a supersolid phase has been shown using numerical simulations @xcite and variational wavefunctions.@xcite for negative hopping @xmath9 it is not possible to use quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations , but at least for the special case of half filling a supersolid phase has been confirmed.@xcite while the existence of the supersolid phase has been firmly established in this model , it would be desirable to obtain a better understanding of the physical mechanism leading to the supersolid phase and an analytical description of the quantum phase transition .    ) and ( [ cl2 ] ) .",

    "[ pd ] ]    the phase diagram of the model is shown in fig .",
    "[ pd ] . for @xmath10 and @xmath11 the solid order is described by a 1/3-ordered state , where the unoccupied sites form a honeycomb sublattice around the filled sites as indicated in fig .",
    "[ hop ] . due to particle - hole symmetry",
    "the equivalent behavior can be seen for @xmath12 in the form of a 2/3 filled state ( see inset of fig .  [ pd ] ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is an analytic quantitative description of the transition to the supersolid phase which occurs for @xmath13 around @xmath14 .",
    "the solid order is three - fold degenerate according to the choice of sublattice , however this degeneracy is _ not _ important for the formation of the supersolid state so we will only consider one representative @xmath15-filled state in what follows .",
    "finite hopping @xmath13 causes quantum fluctuations in form of virtual excitations from the occupied sites onto the unoccupied ones and back .",
    "therefore the ordered state is renormalized , e.g. the density of the unoccupied honeycomb lattice is now finite @xmath16 to lowest order and the occupied density is reduced @xmath17 . however , the delocalization of these virtual excitations is not the driving mechanism for the transition into the supersolid state .",
    "instead we conjecture that a different type of excitation starts to appear at the phase transition , namely  defects  consisting of additional occupied sites .",
    "these defects can only move on the honeycomb lattice of unoccupied sites , while the solid order remains surprisingly stable , which leads to an effective model .",
    "the corresponding effective hamiltonian for hard - core boson defects on the honeycomb lattice can be derived in the strong coupling expansion .",
    "ordinary perturbation theory has a diverging number of contributions , but it is possible to analyze the movement of a single defect by only taking those terms into account which actually involve the defect.@xcite this results in the following effective hamiltonian on the honeycomb sublattice @xmath18 where @xmath19 and the effective hopping parameters are given by @xmath20 for nearest neighbors , @xmath21 for next nearest neighbors , and @xmath22 for next - next nearest neighbors on the honeycomb sublattice as shown in fig .  [ hop ] .",
    "the second - order terms arise from a two - step hopping process , where a boson from the occupied sublattice jumps on an unoccupied site and then the defect takes the place of the original boson , thereby effectively transporting the defect .",
    "likewise , the effective chemical potential is changed @xmath23 since virtual excitations from the unoccupied sublattice and back are now affected by the defect , which results in an effective self - energy . since the defects can move ballistically and coherently on the unoccupied honeycomb sublattice according to the effective model , a finite density of such defects also explains the coexistence of a finite superfluid density on top of a relatively stable renormalized ordered state , which are in fact the central characteristics of the supersolid phase .    the effective model in eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) is of course still an interacting hard - core boson model , but is much easier to treat since we only have to consider small densities of defects as will be seen below . in particular , according to our hypothesis the phase transition line is simply determined by the point when it is energetically favorable to create one single defect . for positive hopping @xmath8",
    "the energy of a single defect is minimized in the uniform @xmath24 state with a total energy of @xmath25 , which must change sign at the phase transition line . by taking also third order processes into account",
    "this results in the following prediction for the phase transition line between solid and supersolid @xmath26 as shown in fig .",
    "[ pd ] this result agrees remarkably well with our qmc simulations , where we used the stochastic series expansion with parallel tempering.@xcite the errorbars for the data from the qmc simulations are smaller than the size of the symbols in all figures .",
    "for @xmath27 the particle hole symmetric line is given by @xmath28 .",
    "a similar analysis can be made for negative hopping @xmath9 .",
    "since the honeycomb lattice is bi - partite the positive nearest neighbor hopping can be restored by a simple gauge transformation of @xmath29 on one sublattice , but the next - nearest neighbor coupling remains negative .",
    "therefore , the ground state energy of one defect is now @xmath30 , and accordingly we obtain a phase transition line of the form @xmath31 where we have again taken third order processes into account . for negative",
    "hopping it is more difficult to treat the problem with numerical methods , so there are no independent checks for this prediction so far .",
    "however , considering the good agreement for the positive hopping case above , it is reasonable to expect that the same calculation also applies for negative hopping with similar accuracy .",
    "we therefore find that the supersolid region is stable but slightly narrower for negative hopping , which appears to be caused by the additional kinetic frustration .    ]",
    "in order to calculate the detailed behavior near the phase transition analytically it is now possible to use linear spin - wave theory on the effective hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the system is at low filling ( i.e.  nearly saturated in terms of spins ) and that the honeycomb lattice has two nonequivalent sites , but otherwise the spin - wave calculation follows the standard scheme.@xcite in particular , the hard - core bosons can be mapped exactly onto spins , which are expressed in a rotated frame according to the classical alignment . the classical angle relative to the @xmath32-direction is given by @xmath33 ) in terms of the field @xmath34 .",
    "the spins are then re - expressed in terms of regular bosons , which has the advantage that the interaction can be solved by a bogoluibov transformation to linear order .",
    "this procedure is especially reliable in the low density limit near the phase transition that we are interested in .",
    "the details of this calculation can be found in the appendix .",

    "( [ sw - dens ] ) ( lines ) , where the small background contribution @xmath44 from virtual excitations was added .",
    "the virtual excitations are localized so this finite background density does not contribute to the superfluid density which is also confirmed by the data in fig .",

    "( [ cl ] ) .",
    "the good agreement not only confirms the validity of the effective model on the honeycomb lattice in eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) , but also provides an analytical tool to calculate the general behavior and correlations near the phase transition for both positive and negative hopping @xmath4 . as a check we have also computed densities and correlations on the honeycomb lattice , which agree equally well with the original triangular model ( not shown ) . the correlations between the occupied sublattice and the unoccupied honeycomb sublattice can be calculated by the modified perturbation theory discussed above , which results in positive @xmath46 correlations between sublattices for @xmath8 , while the correlations cancel to second order for @xmath9 , i.e. the occupied sublattice always gives only a very weak contribution to the superfluid density as indicated by the spin directions in fig .",

    "[ rhos ] ]    the superfluid density on the unoccupied honeycomb sublattice can be calculated in the effective spin model as the response to a small twist @xmath47 in the x - y plane @xmath48 .",
    "expanding the hamiltonian leads to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the projection of the twist along the corresponding bond direction , @xmath51 is the spin current , and @xmath52 is the spin - kinetic energy.@xcite in linear spin - wave theory the response to the spin current does not contribute in the low density limit and the superfluid is therefore approximated by the correlation functions @xmath53 of neighbors connected by @xmath54 @xmath55 which can be calculated in the rotated spin frame ( see appendix ) . in fig .",
    "[ rhos ] we compare the results from eq .",
    "( [ sw - rhos ] ) on the honeycomb lattice with the superfluid density @xmath56 derived from the winding number @xmath57 in qmc simulations for the triangular lattice in the thermodynamic limit near the phase transition .",
    "the predictions from the effective model also show a sharp increase at the phase transition , but the agreement is limited to a smaller region since the contribution of the spin current response was not included . in any case",
    ", the agreement near the phase transition line again gives strong support for the validity of the effective model in eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) .",
    "finally , we would like to consider the implications of our model for the supersolid to superfluid transition , which has been reported to be second order before.@xcite if our model is correct this transition should simply correspond to a melting of the solid due to the appearance of more and more virtual excitations , i.e.  a breakdown of the perturbation expansion . while we have not found an energetic condition which would quantify the location of the supersolid to superfluid transition line",
    ", we believe that such a melting transition should be first order .",
    "one reason is also that a third order term in the ginzburg landau expansion is generically allowed by momentum conservation for an order parameter with triangular symmetry , so that a continuous transition can only occur at special points.@xcite we have therefore tested the behavior of the phase transition with qmc simulations . in fig .",
    "[ jump ] it can be seen that for @xmath58 the structure factor abruptly goes to zero close to @xmath59 while the densities show clear discontinuities . for larger @xmath5 and smaller @xmath4 closer to the particle - hole symmetric point these discontinuities",
    "become systematically smaller , but can still be observed even without histogram methods .",
    "the discontinuity in @xmath60 corresponds to a region of phase separation if the density is held fixed as shown in the inset . during preparation of the paper we discussed our discovery of the first order behavior with one of the authors of ref .",

    "in conclusion we proposed an analytical model in the form of defects moving in an ordered background , which gives a quantitative description of the solid to supersolid transition in the hard - core boson model . in this way",
    "the transition line can be determined and correlations nearby can be calculated with the help of spin - wave theory for positive and negative hopping @xmath4 . for positive @xmath4",
    "the calculations agree well with qmc simulations .",
    "for @xmath9 we make a quantitative prediction for the supersolid region , which has so far not been estimated by numerical methods .",
    "we find that the kinetic frustration for @xmath9 does not destroy the supersolid phase , but the higher order corrections imply a narrower region .",
    "in fact , the higher order terms imply a possible maximum of the extent of the supersolid phase with increasing @xmath64 in this case .",
    "it is indeed feasible that a configuration corresponding to a low density ( spin down ) on one sublattice and a small x - y antiferromagnetic order on the other two sublattices may be stable all the way to the su(2 ) invariant point @xmath65 . in this case",
