    "an extremely active sub - branch of condensed matter physics has concerned itself over the past decade with the quest to find majorana bound states in topological insulators  @xcite and superconductors  @xcite .",
    "these are localized zero - energy excitations that obey non - abelian statistics , meaning that a pair of them widely separated in space can be prepared in a superposition which is protected by topology against decoherence .",
    "there are in principle several ways one can go about looking for majorana bound states in topological superconductors .",
    "the `` gold standard '' is unquestionably an interference - type measurement , which directly probes their non - abelian nature . these are difficult , however , and an appealing second option for experimentalists is to look for signatures of the zero - energy nature of majorana states .",
    "here there are essentially two possibilities : probe the single - particle green s function via surface density - of - states ( dos ) measurements  @xcite or look for signatures in two - particle response functions . while the former is a seemingly direct probe of the zero - energy nature of majorana bound states , zero - bias anomalies in the dos arise in a number of contexts , and do not necessarily imply the existence of majoranas .",
    "( at the same time , indirect probes of the dos of superfluid @xmath0he , including transverse acoustic impedance  @xcite , specific heat  @xcite , and sound attenuation  @xcite measurements , are consistent with a gapless spectrum within the bulk superfluid gap . ) the latter approach , on the other hand , seems ideally suited for charge - neutral topological superfluids such as @xmath0he , for which surface dos measurements are not possible .",
    "there is of course a precedent for looking for signatures of zero - energy modes in two - particle response functions .",
    "the dc hall conductivity in two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) is exactly equal to fundamental constants multiplied by the chern number  @xcite , a topological invariant that provides a measure of the number of zero - energy modes along the edge of this system . unlike 2degs , however , the low - frequency response properties of superconductors are dominated by the appearance of a gapless goldstone branch  @xcite .",
    "( the fact that the physical goldstone mode is gapped out in electronic systems does not matter : the zero - energy poles of the response functions survive polarization corrections  @xcite . )",
    "given the presence of _ two _ in - gap excitation branches  majorana and goldstone  in a topological superconductor , it is natural to ask whether signatures of the former are obfuscated by the latter , especially given that the poles of two particle response functions coincide with the collective mode ( goldstone ) spectrum  @xcite .",
    "as an example of this , the interplay of the gapless majorana edge and goldstone branches in a two - dimensional time - reversal symmetry - breaking chiral @xmath2-wave superconductor leads to a non - local optical hall conductivity  @xcite _ xy ( , ) = .[sigmahall]here @xmath3 reduces to the chern number in the limit where the superconducting gap @xmath4 is much smaller than the fermi energy @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the sound velocity in this limit .",
    "equation  ( [ sigmahall ] ) shows that the optical hall response of a chiral superconductor is dominated by the goldstone pole at @xmath7 .",
    "the only hope for detecting a majorana branch ( via a nonzero chern number ) is to probe _ below _ the goldstone pole , with a spatially inhomogeneous electric field such that @xmath8 , a practical impossibility given that the the speed of light is generally much larger than the speed of sound .    in this paper",
    ", we turn our attention to another manifestation of this same physics and consider the longitudinal spin susceptibility of a thin film of @xmath0he-@xmath1 which is predicted to harbour majorana states at its surfaces .",
    "recently , a number of authors have argued that these states would give rise to a spectral feature in the spin susceptibility which could be observed in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments  @xcite .",
    "these predictions are based on mean - field calculations , however , and ignore effects related to the collective modes which arise from order parameter fluctuations . here",
    "we derive a locally gauge - invariant theory of the spin response function . as with the optical hall response ( [ sigmahall ] ) , we find that the spin response is dominated by the collective modes of the superconducting order parameter  in this case , longitudinal spin modes propagating in the plane of the film .",
    "signatures of the majorana states manifest themselves in the damping of these spin modes .",
    "extending an idea put forth by silaev  @xcite , a fingerprint of majorana states can be found in the tunability of this damping in the presence of a magnetic field .",

    "for a system with translational invariance , the @xmath0he order parameter can be written in terms of the tensor @xmath53 as  @xcite ( ) = _ jid_jk_().[op0]the order parameter is a @xmath148 matrix in spin space , where e.g. , the component that represents pairing between atoms with nuclear spins @xmath149 and @xmath19 is given by @xmath150 .",
    "@xmath53 couples spin and orbital degrees of freedom , with @xmath151 the @xmath152 component of the momentum @xmath153 .",
    "one possible choice for the order parameter is the diagonal tensor @xmath154 .",
    "ignoring dipolar and surface effects , any relative rotation of spin and orbital axes yields a state degenerate with this one . as a result ,",
    "the order parameter is usually expressed as a rotation matrix @xmath155 : d_i = ( _ 0/k_f)r_i _ i.[opdiag ]    the rotation matrix is fully characterized by specifying an axis of rotation @xmath156 and an angle of rotation @xmath157 about this axis . while these are arbitrary for an infinite , uniform superfluid when the dipolar energy is ignored , in conjunction with surface effects , the dipolar energy fixes both of these quantities in a confined superfluid .",
    "even in a completely uniform system without boundaries , the dipolar energy fixes the angle of rotation , given by the so - called leggett angle @xmath158  @xcite . including surface effects , the rotation angle is unchanged from @xmath159  @xcite , while the axis of rotation @xmath156 is determined by the interplay between surface and dipolar effects and the external magnetic field  @xcite , if any . for sufficiently small magnetic field",
    ", @xmath62 g  @xcite ( see also , ref .  , above 6.132 ) however , surface effects dominate and near the surface , the dipolar energy orients @xmath156 to be normal to the surface .",
    "as long as the film is thinner than the dipole coherence length ( @xmath160 m @xmath161 , where @xmath13 is the bcs coherence length ) , the axis of rotation is fixed to be normal to the surface throughout the film .        )",
    ".[op]it is convenient to calculate quantities in a basis where the order parameter matrix is diagonal .",
    "this is accomplished by fixing the spin axes and rotating the orbital ones in the @xmath164 plane by the leggett angle . for the calculations in this paper ,",
    "we thus take the order parameter to be diagonal , given by ( [ opdiag ] ) , but where it is understood that the orbital axes are rotated in the @xmath164 plane .",
    "combining ( [ op0 ] ) and ( [ op ] ) gives ( ) = (      ) .in the semiclassical approximation for the situation where there is a surface at @xmath14 , treating the order parameter amplitudes as constant above for @xmath165 , this reduces to ( [ hz ] ) in the main text .",
