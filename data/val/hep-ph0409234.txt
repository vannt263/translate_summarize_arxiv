    "to study the interplay of perturbative and nonperturbative dynamics in processes involving hadronic states it is natural to begin with observables whose perturbative analysis is well understood . for certain observables ,",
    "perturbation theory not only provides predictions at leading power in a large momentum scale , but also characterizes power corrections in that scale .",
    "this can come about , for example , through nonconvergent perturbative expansions that exhibit sensitivity to the strong - coupling and/or vacuum structure of the theory @xcite .    relying on perturbative resummations ,",
    "this approach has had phenomenological successes in the description of a variety of inclusive and semi - inclusive cross sections .",
    "these include average and differential event shapes , primarily but not exclusively in @xmath5 annihilation [ 2 - 9 ] , and electroweak annihilation cross sections at measured transverse momentum [ 10 - 13 ] .",
    "the value of the event shape or lepton pair transverse momentum provides a second scale in the cross section , and varying this scale changes the relative importance of perturbative and nonperturbative dynamics .",
    "thus , the transition between perturbative and nonperturbative qcd is in principle available for study in these observables .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt this general philosophy and employ the joint resummation @xcite of threshold @xcite and transverse momentum @xcite enhancements to study power corrections in the hard - scattering scale @xmath0 for single - particle inclusive ( 1pi ) cross sections in the large @xmath6 region . using direct photon production as an example , we will show that these corrections exhibit significant @xmath1 dependence , which moderates both perturbative and nonperturbative recoil at large @xmath1 compared to estimates based on transverse momentum resummation alone .",
    "these conclusions are made possible by a simplification of the joint resummation formalism that is specific to the @xmath7 limit .",
    "direct photon production was originally envisioned as a relatively straightforward process with which to test fixed - order perturbative calculations and to determine the gluon distribution @xcite .",
    "the extensive data on direct photon production [ 20 - 24 ] , however , has turned out to be more complex than was perhaps expected .",
    "presumably for this reason it has inspired varied theoretical and phenomenological studies [ 25 - 37 ] .",
    "nevertheless , for this benchmark process important questions remain unresolved . in particular , it has been argued that fixed target data for direct photon production in the lower @xmath0 range ( roughly below 5 gev ) are difficult to reconcile with collinear - factorized nlo cross sections @xcite .",
    "additionally , threshold resummation @xcite appears to explain the data only for larger @xmath0 .",
    "this difficulty has motivated the use of @xmath8-dependent , or unintegrated , parton distributions combined with recoiling partonic @xmath9 subprocesses @xcite .",
    "information on the partonic transverse momenta in such distributions may come from resummed perturbation theory @xcite , and/or from comparisons to data @xcite , including drell - yan , photon and hadron pair cross sections .",
    "probably the simplest approach is to assume a gaussian dependence @xmath10 $ ] @xcite .",
    "as we review below , perturbative resummations predict logarithmic @xmath0 dependence for the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "they also imply that @xmath11 depends on the parton flavor .",
    "the use of unintegrated distributions requires an extension of collinear factorization @xcite .",
    "in particular , a technical challenge in the case of light particle production is the potential for an artificial infrared singularity when the total transverse momentum of the initial state partons is comparable to the observed @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "one way to avoid this singularity is to impose strong ordering in transverse momenta , as in @xcite , a procedure which requires definition beyond leading logarithm .",
    "a related approach is described detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on a specific implementation of @xmath8-resummation . as presented in @xcite , however , fits in this formalism favor fixed @xmath11 , with no indication of the @xmath0-dependence implied by @xmath8 resummation .",
    "other studies , however , seem to imply that @xmath11 is @xmath12-dependent @xcite . in summary",
    ", it remains unclear how much of what we interpret as recoil , or parton transverse momentum , is perturbative and how much nonperturbative .",
    "here we come back to this question in the context of a generalized resummation formalism .    resummed perturbation theory for 1pi cross sections was extended in @xcite using joint resummation .",
    "joint resummation systematically combines singular behavior at zero transverse momentum for initial - state partons with that at partonic threshold , where the initial state partonic invariant mass @xmath13 is just large enough to produce the observed final state .",
    "this method was applied to z and higgs production in @xcite , where no kinematic singularities arise , because the produced electroweak state is massive and the transverse momentum of the lepton pair is directly observed . in @xcite , some implications for the specific forms of power corrections were also pointed out .",
    "although the joint formalism was applied to high-@xmath0 photon production in @xcite , its application was hampered by the same infrared singularity mentioned above , associated with the production of a massless particle .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the complexity of a simultaneous resummation in transverse momentum and energy above threshold appears to make impractical a matching of the sort developed for transverse momentum resummation alone in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we extend this work , and revisit logarithmic and power corrections to the direct photon cross section in the joint resummation formalism .",
    "compared to previous work , however , we use the kinematics of the large-@xmath1 limit to reformulate joint resummation , taking into account recoil effects in the partonic subprocess while avoiding a kinematic singularity .",
    "the resulting resummed cross section reduces to threshold resummation at next - to - leading logarithm ( nll ) and can be matched to finite - order and threshold resummed cross sections in a straightforward fashion .",
    "beginning at nnll , the cross section also includes a contribution that can be identified as the finite residue left from the cancellation of the transverse momentum singularities of real and virtual gluons radiated in the initial state .",
    "enhancements to the cross section associated with final state interactions are treated only to leading power in this paper , and appear in the same manner as in threshold resummation . in another paper",
    "we will argue that the results found here are not changed qualitatively by these effects .",
    "the parameters that control power corrections associated with joint resummation at partonic threshold are found to be related to parameters familiar from the transverse momentum distributions in electroweak annihilation .",
    "the power corrections also inherit significant energy dependence .",
    "for large @xmath1 , both perturbative recoil and nonperturbative power corrections to the predictions of threshold resummation are suppressed by the phase space restrictions built into joint resummation .",
    "this effect is important , however , only for @xmath1 near one , or equivalently for large values of its conjugate mellin moment variable @xmath14 . for smaller @xmath1 or @xmath14 of order unity",
    "an analysis based on @xmath8 resummation alone may be appropriate , but should be matched to the results of joint resummation in the large @xmath1 region .",
    "we begin sec .  2 with a brief summary of the joint resummation formula as developed for direct photon cross sections , and exhibit the kinematic singularity .",
    "in the next subsection , the cross section is expressed as a double inverse transform .",
    "this is followed by a simple reformulation that eliminates the kinematic singularity and reduces the jointly resummed cross section to a single transform that extends threshold resummation for the direct photon cross section .",
    "the resulting sudakov exponents of joint resummation are analyzed in sec .",
    "3 , where we identify the form of the recoil and power corrections to the direct photon cross section that are implied by joint resummation .",
    "we explore the phenomenology of these corrections in sec .  4 ,",
    "exhibit the suppression of power corrections for large @xmath12 at fixed @xmath0 , and briefly discuss possible subdominant corrections not directly associated with partonic threshold .",
    "we conclude with a summary , and a brief discussion of possible implications for an eventual global treatment of single - photon and single - hadron cross sections .",
    "joint resummation @xcite is an extension of threshold @xcite and transverse momentum resummations @xcite that unifies these two formalisms .",
    "so far , at the phenomenological level it has been applied primarily to the single electroweak boson ( mass @xmath15 ) production cross sections at low transverse momentum , @xmath16  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "threshold resummation is associated with corrections of the form @xmath17\\ln^{2n-1}(1-z)$ ] , with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the invariant mass of the partonic pair that annihilates into the observed boson .",
    "such corrections are  implicit \" in the sense that they contribute to the hadronic cross section only after convolution with the parton distribution functions , and hence give nonlogarithmic , although potentially significant , contributions to the cross section .",
    "singular corrections in @xmath20 , on the other hand , are explicit in the cross sections themselves , appearing as terms like @xmath21 directly for the measured spectrum .    for single - particle inclusive cross sections such as direct photon production at measured @xmath22 the situation is slightly different . to leading order in the hard scattering ,",
    "incoming partons produce a photon - parton system , which subsequently evolves into a photon - jet pair . at higher orders in @xmath23 ,",
    "the pair recoils against unobserved soft gluon radiation with total transverse momentum @xmath20 , in much the same way as for a single electroweak boson .",
    "when only the photon is observed , @xmath20 is integrated and singularities at @xmath24 cancel , analogously to singularities at @xmath25 in threshold resummation .",
    "thus in the direct photon cross section at measured @xmath0 , both transverse momentum and threshold singularities are implicit rather than explicit .",
    "nevertheless , small-@xmath20 gluon radiation can play a significant role in the cross section . applied to direct photon production , joint resummation attempts to estimate the effects of these soft emissions systematically @xcite .    for an observed photon of momentum @xmath0 , the photon transverse momentum in the pair center - of - mass is _",

    "their effect is non - negligible because the fall - off in soft gluon transverse momenta has a power - like perturbative tail . in @xcite , we dealt with the kinematic singularity in a rather crude way by cutting off the resummed @xmath20 spectrum at a convenient scale @xmath29 : p_t^3 d _",

    "we will show below that this may be achieved by applying an additional , self - consistent approximation that is exact at partonic threshold .",
    "to do so , we must recall the explicit form of the cross section derived in refs .",
