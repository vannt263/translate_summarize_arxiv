    "recently , the physics of ring - shaped molecular magnets with antiferromagnetic interactions and an odd number of interacting spin centers ( e.g. paramagnetic ions ) has attracted a great deal of interest since they provide emblematic examples of systems where spin frustration effects due to quantum magnetism play a major role .",
    "moreover , they have been sinthesized and studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "specifically , we shall concentrate on the anomalous magnetic properties in some heterometallic odd spin rings @xcite namely , chromium rings .",
    "the system comprises eight chromium(iii ) ions with spin @xmath2 each , and one nickel(ii ) ion with spin @xmath3 .",
    "the magnetic properties of this first odd - member antiferromagnetic ring has been investigated with electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) and its spin frustrated properties has been visualized by means of a mbius strip . in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative and complementary picture of the ground state of this cr8ni ring molecule using valence bond states ( vbs ) @xcite of virtual spins which are used to represent the spins @xmath4 of the real constituent ions .",
    "we will show that the particular bond pattern acquired by these vbs states is a consequence and manifestation of the spin frustration in the odd cr8ni ring molecule .",
    "molecular nanomagnets are fascinating new magnetic materials @xcite .",
    "they appear in a large variety of compounds with many different properties .",
    "we shall focus on antiferromagnetic compounds of bimetallic rings .",
    "these molecules are ideal candidates to study the physics of simple but nontrivial spin models like the af heisenberg interaction .",
    "the key point here is that , these molecules show very interesting finite - size quantum many - body effects which are typically overlooked in other studies of the heisenberg model where the main focus is to achieve the thermodynamic limit ( number of spins going to infinity ) . in those studies ,",
    "the small finite - size effects are considered spurious effects that vanish for larger and larger systems , which eventually may show some sort of universality , if that is the case .",
    "quite on the contrary , the nice thing of these small molecules is that we can vary its size and coupling constant strenghts such that the finite - size effects become some real property that can be addressed experimentally , theoretically and numerically .",
    "some intersting examples of these small quantum effects that we study in this paper are level crossing , change in the nature of their the ground state ( e.g. , from spin singlet to spin triplet or higher ) , existence of excited states very close to the ground state , etc .    in sect.[hamiltonian_description ]",
    "we introduce a heisenberg hamiltonian to describe the interactions between the two types of ions in the bimetallic compound cr8ni , where the ni ion plays the role of an impurity within an homogeneous chain of @xmath1 ions with the shape of a ring molecule . in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] we present the energy spectrum of this hamiltonian obtained numerically with an appropriate lanczos technique . in sect.[vbs_picture ] , we first provide the vbs - picture for the cr8ni ring molecule based on a strong coupling limit in the ni impurity coupling .",
    "this is the origin of the spin frustration in the system . in order to support this vbs - picture",
    ", we provide numerical results for a generalized string order parameter that is able to detect the type of virtual bond structure . in sect.[frustration_dynamics ]",
    "we study the frustration effects in this ring - molecule and test the associated vbs state picture by means of a numerical study of time - evolved correlation functions of spin - spin operators for different ions in the nano - molecule .",
    "sect.[sect_conclusions ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "magnetic molecules are emblematic instances of an ensemble of non - interacting quantum systems embedded in a condensed matter environment .",
    "the synthesis of molecular magnets has undergone rapid progress in recent years .",
    "each of those quantum systems are identical molecular units that can contain as few as two and up to several dozens of paramagnetic ions ( spins ) . in our case , they correspond to cr8ni ring molecules .",
    "this molecule is one of the many relevant molecules containing transition - metal ions whose spins are so strongly - exchange coupled that when the temperature is low enough , their behaviour is like single - domain particles with a certain total spin @xcite .",
    "macroscopically , these materials appear as crystals or powders .",
    "nonetheless , their intermolecular magnetic interactions are utterly negligible when compared to their intramolecular interactions .",
    "thus , measurements of their magnetic properties reflect mainly ensemble properties of single molecules .",
    "there are two major advantages in the research on these molecule aggregates .",
    "firstly , the outstanding degree of accuracy by which their magnetic dynamics can usually be modeled . secondly , the opportunity to chemically engineer molecules possessing desired physical properties @xcite . in our case , the interest relies on the study of the heisenberg model in situations that are usually discarded when studying that model in infinite one- , two- , and three - dimensional systems .",
    "our studies will reinforce the idea that such spin arrays yield qualitatively new physics caused by the finite size of the system .",
    "the cr8ni compound belongs to a wider family of molecular rings . in molecules with a small number of ions , there exist big differences in their physics depending on each particular compound .",
    "a first major difference is related to the number of its ions : odd or even . in this regard ,",
    "the implications are mainly twofold : first , having a difference of one ion in the same family of molecules , can cause the molecule to have a neat magnetic moment or not , therefore changing its magnetic properties drastically .",
    "second , and interestingly enough , a molecular ring with completeley antiferromagnetic interactions between nearest neighbors ions can be a candidate to present quantum spin frustration properties if the number of atoms is odd , while this effect will not generally be present for even member rings in a given family compound .    as it happens , in the majority of these molecules the localized single - particle magnetic moments of the ions couple antiferromagnetically .",
    "then , their spectrum is described rather well by the heisenberg model with very few parameters because of the high symmetry of the molecular configurations .",
    "these coupling parameters correspond to isotropic nearest neighbor interaction sometimes augmented by anisotropy terms .",
    "the cr8ni compound is one of the first antiferromagnetic odd member rings which has been artificially sinthesized .",
    "the results of its magnetic properties are interpreted within the framework of a spin hamiltonian approach and they nicely fit the pattern of the energy levels obtained by inelastic neutron spectroscopy .",
    "there exists also reports on its magnetic and spin frustration effects @xcite . in view of these properties , it has been proposed @xcite that the behavior of this molecule can be properly explained with a nearest neighbors heisenberg model where only two different microscopic couplings play a role : one is the coupling that parametrizes the strength of the interaction existing between the @xmath0 and the neighbor pair of @xmath1 .",
    "the other one is the coupling that takes into account the interaction between the @xmath1-@xmath1 pairs , which can be considered the same for each pair .",
    "the easy - axis anisotropy term is reported to be very weak how as to play any role .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian that we shall study has the following form : @xmath5 , \\end{split } \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where , for convenience , the @xmath1 atoms have been numbered from 1 to 8 , being these latter the two neighbors of the @xmath0 atom .",
    "notice that , since the spin of the niquel is equal to @xmath6 and the spin of the @xmath1 atoms is @xmath7 , the total spin of the molecule must be integer .     and @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , in the antiferromagnetic region @xmath9 k the ground state is a triplet for @xmath10 k and a singlet elsewhere .",
    "_ inset : _ for higher values of @xmath8 the ground state is a singlet and the first excited state is a triplet very close in energy .",
    ", width=340 ]    in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] we have plotted some lowest lying energy levels of this hamiltonian . in sect .",
    "[ frustration_dynamics ] we shall explain how these numerical results have been obtained with a multitarget lanczos method . it can be observed that , in some regime of the coupling constants @xmath8 and @xmath11 , the energy levels are highly braided and , as a consecuence , the ground state has different value of the total spin depending on the exact value of these couplings .",
    "however , as can be seen from the inset of this figure , for large values of @xmath8 the ground state is always a spin singlet with a triplet state very close in energy above it . in this work",
    ", we will restrict our study to the antiferromagnetic ( @xmath9 ) region and in particular to the region where the ground state is a singlet . from fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] we see that this area corresponds to @xmath12 k , while the region @xmath13k is characterized by a ground state with total spin equal to one ( for convenience the computations in fig .  [ spectrum ]",
    "have been done with a fixed value of @xmath14 k ) .",
    "the interest in the domain where the ground state is a singlet comes not only from the fact that it spans the most extension in the antiferromagnetic area , but also because the physics of the real cr8ni seems to be in agreement with a regime close to @xmath14 k and @xmath15 k , with a non - magnetic ground state .",
    "therefore , the interest of our study relies on the fact that it can provide new insights into the physics of a not so well - known state of matter but with a well defined connection with experiments in real compounds .",
    "a valence bond solid is a particular quantum many - body state that can be understood as follows : given a system of _ real _ particles with total spin @xmath16 , we can split each one of them into @xmath17 _ virtual _ particles of spin @xmath18 . in order to recover the original spins , we enforce these _ virtual _ particles to couple ( i.e. , symmetrize ) among themselves in order to give the original spin @xmath16 particles . to create now a wavefunction with total spin equal to zero , we make singlets ( i.e. , antisymmetrize ) out of every pair of _ virtual _ particles",
    ".    we will denote each of these singlet pairs between _ virtual _ particles as a bond .",
    "there are a lot of different possible ways to fix the bonds between all the _ virtual _ particles and , in general , the total wave - function may have contributions from all these configurations .",
    "there exist however some physical situations in which only some particular bond configurations , out of the whole possible set , take part in the wave - function : some systems have a major contribution coming only from one particular bond arrangement .",
    "these systems are commonly dubbed bond crystals .",
    "it may also happen that there exist not one but some few bonds configurations whose weights are dominant in the total wave - function . in this case the system is called a resonating valence bond solid ( rvbs ) . there exist yet another kind of more disordered states , denoted @xmath19-vbs , which we shall see that describe properly the ground state of the cr8ni in the singlet region .",
    "a general @xmath19-vbs state is built by forming bonds only between _ virtual _ spins belonging to neighbor _ real _ particles , with the numbers @xmath20 satisfying @xmath21 and @xmath16 being the spin of the _ real _ particle .     and",
    "the two virtual spins in the neighbor @xmath1 atoms forces a dimerized pattern in the rest of the chain .",
    "this vbs configuration becomes the dominant one in the strongly coupled impurity limit @xmath22 .",
    ", width=226 ]    these states are usually translationally invariant ( with the @xmath19-vbs notation this means that @xmath23 ) in those systems where the hamiltonian possess this symmetry .",
    "there also exist dimerized @xmath19-vbs states that have been shown to appear in systems where the full translational symmetry of the hamiltonian has been partially broken such that still exist an enlarged unit cell .",
    "typically , this effect can be obtained by introducing an external dimerization coupling constant in the hamiltonian that still preserves some periodicity .",
    "our main result in this section is that there is another mechanism to provide such dimerized @xmath19-vbs states in the cr8ni ring molecule and whose success precisely resides in the existence of an impurity within an homogeneous system . to understand this mechanism in the particular case of the cr8ni , we resort to the strong coupling limit where the antiferromagnetic interaction between the @xmath0 and its neighbors is much larger that the interaction among @xmath1 pairs . as shown in fig .",
    "[ vbscr8ni ] , the two _ virtual _ spins comprising the @xmath0 will be likely to form bonds with the _ virtual _ particles in the neighbor chromiums to satisfy their antiferromagnetic constraints . the rest of the _ virtual _ spins left will then tend to form similar bonds with their neighbor partners , giving as a result a dimerized non translationally invariant vbs .",
    "we would like to stress the fact that the validity of this picture is rooted in the existence of the @xmath0 impurity .",
    "in fact , the physics of a homogeneous system of @xmath1 atoms is closer to a gapless critical phase rather than to such a gapped state .",
    "general @xmath19-vbs states belong to a class of spin liquids which are known to possess an special hidden order that can be identified by a particular non - local order parameter called the string order parameter ( sop ) @xcite .",
    "this order parameter has proved itself extremely successful in the task of characterizing diverse kinds of such states , both in the pure one dimensional cases and also in less trivial systems such as ladders @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we shall see that this parameter also allows us to characterize the cr8ni ground state .",
    "the definition of the generalized string order parameter is as follows @xcite :    @xmath24    -vbs . in the diagram at the bottom",
    "we have the same physical configuration but now we are breaking one bond at the left and two at the right end , which characterizes a @xmath25-vbs . notice that both measures have been taken with an odd number of sites ,",
    "otherwise the sop is zero.,width=9 ]    the limit @xmath26 going to infinite must be understood as comprising a region large enough so as to neglect finite - size efects . in our case",
    "the system itself is finite , however we will see that the results are still conclusive despite some corrections that have to be considered due to this fact .",
    "we hereby summarize the most relevant properties of the sop for our purposes : + i/ the sop is symmetric with respect @xmath27 .",
    "+ ii/ the imaginary part of the sop vanishes as we consider larger systems .",
    "+ iii/ due to the fact that the definition of the sop makes use of antisymmetric operators under spin flip , the number of sites considered in the measure must be odd in order to have an even number of these operators .",
    "otherwise the sop is zero .",
    "+ iv/ given a generic @xmath19-vbs state , the number of zeros of this operator in the interval @xmath28 coincides with the number @xmath29 .",
    "+ v/ two measures of the sop begining in adjacent sites will differ in the order of the numbers @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "that is , if one measure gives a @xmath19-vbs state , the other will be a @xmath31-vbs ( see fig .",
    "[ odd_evenvbs ] ) .",
    "+    fig4a.eps ( 0,65)a )    fig4b.eps ( 0,65)b )    in order to show the existence of a vbs - picture of the cr8ni molecule as described in fig.[vbscr8ni ] , we have computed the generalized string order parameter in the ground state of the molecule for different ratios of the coupling constants @xmath11 and @xmath8 . in virtue of property iv/ above we can characterize the vbs state counting the number of zeros of this operator . moreover , we have some freedom at choosing the starting and end sites to measure the sop ( i.e , the numbers @xmath32 and @xmath33 in definition ) and we will see that the results are consistent with property v/.    in fig .",
    "[ sopfig ] we have plotted the sop computed in two different blocks of the ring and adjacent starting sites ( these blocks are represented in fig .",
    "[ odd_evenvbs ] ) .",
    "remarkably , even in this small molecule , the imaginary part of the sop vanishes in all our computations .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ sopfig]a the curves with high values of @xmath8 have two local minima in the interval @xmath34 whose value is compatible with zero considering that the system is finite and the block used to measure the sop comprises only some few spins .",
    "this result is consistent with a @xmath35-vbs .",
    "the shape of the sop is also typical of these states , with two noticeable maxima placed approximately at @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "accordingly , the computations shown in fig .  [ sopfig]b shall be consistent with a @xmath25-vbs as explained above .",
    "we see that again the shape of the sop for the strong coupling curves shares the main features of these states , that is , one substantial maximum placed precisely at @xmath38 .",
    "there is however a major difference at @xmath39 and @xmath27 , where the sop does not vanish but has a significant negative value .",
    "at these points the exponentials in the definition of the sop do not play any role and hence it is a usual spin - spin correlator between the two @xmath1 atoms at the end of the block .",
    "since our ring is finite and closed it is quite natural to think that the @xmath40 and @xmath41 spins are highly correlated via the spin frustration in the @xmath0 impurity .",
    "therefore , such a finite value at @xmath39 only shows the compromise between the bulk @xmath25-vbs picture of the whole system and the local physics of those spins .    in summary",
    ", the string order parameter reveals that the ground state of the cr8ni in the strong impurity coupling limit is consistent with a impurity - mediated mechanism of spin frustration , the result of which is the vbs - pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ vbscr8ni ] .",
    "since we are dealing with a finite system the possibilities to drastically change the nature of the ground state are limited , that is , the possibility of a quantum phase transition is excluded and only a crossing with another energy level can produce this effect .",
    "therefore , the intermediate @xmath42 regime can be considered as some deformation of the strong coupling limit . as we decrease @xmath8 and the @xmath43 state crosses the @xmath44 , the vbs picture breaks down and the measures of the sop are not meaningful in the sense that the properties of this operator in such a state are not well defined .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the cr8ni ring molecule is frustrated in the sense that the minimum energy of the system can not be obtained minimizing separatedly each of the two body terms of the hamiltonian . another way to see",
    "it is by resorting to the classical limit where each spin is pictured as a classical vector .",
    "once we set the value of one of those classical spins , then we can fix one by one the rest of the spins in order to minimize the local interactions , but in the end there will be one spin for which the local interaction with both of its neighbors can not be minimized at the same time .",
    "typically , systems where frustration exists come along with a rich and very often not so well - known physics . roughly speaking",
    ", we can say that frustration in general increases the complexity of those systems , both in the physics they exhibit as well as in the way to approach them . in particular",
    ", there is not a well defined way to measure the amount and localization of frustration .",
    "an attempt to quantify these effects in cr8ni can be done attending to the structural changes of the gound state as we vary the couplings .",
    "that is , by inspection of the way in which spins in the ring couple to form the final state .",
    "this procedure has a connection with experimental techniques where the lande factors of the ring can be measured .",
    "however this procedure is not suitable to study a rotationally invariant singlet ground state where the spin is zero . in this section",
    "we will study the behavior of the cr8ni molecule by means of computing the time evolution of some important spin correlators : the spin autocorrelation of the impurity @xmath0 atom with itself and the spin correlation between the @xmath0 atoms and each @xmath1 along the ring .",
    "these correlators correspond to the vacuum expectation value of the time - evolved spin operators @xmath45 and @xmath46 projected onto the spin operator of the @xmath0 impurity at @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "this is a way to dynamically probe @xcite the spin structure in the ground state @xmath49 of the ring molecule .",
    "in fact , we shall consider the square modulus of those correlators and interpret them as time - evolution probabilities .",
    "that is , we shall consider the following correlators in order to construct a figure of merit : @xmath50 and @xmath51 notice that in a rotationally invariant singlet ground state @xmath49 the correlations in the @xmath52 and @xmath53 axis have the same value and thus , the expresions above can be written as : @xmath54 @xmath55 since the proportionality factor does not provide any additional information we will discard it from now on and will consider the bare @xmath53-axis projection correlators .",
    "the time dependency of the operators is given by the usual heisenberg picture : @xmath56 the idea behind this figure of merit to measure the dynamical correlations between spins is similar to the static correlator used to measure spin correlations in space separated sites @xmath32 and @xmath33 of the ring @xmath57 .",
    "this static correlator measure spatial correlations , while our purpose is to measure time - evolved correlations which will probe not only the ground state physics but also the excited states physics .",
    "we next explain briefly the numerical method used to evaluate these correlators .",

    "we have observed that the agreement is excelent for low values of @xmath8 while it goes worse for higher values of the coupling constant .",

    "these accuracy checks confirm that our numerical results are good enough so as to interpret them on physical grounds with respect to the spin frustracion effects described in previous sections .",

    "the impurity acquires strong antiferromagnetic compromises with both of its neighbors that can not satisfy simultaneously .",
    "frustration is known to impose complex constraints that can destabilize , deform and even produce new states of matter .",
    "on the other hand , the dynamics of each spin of the system is highly influenced by these constraints . in the following paragraphs",
    "we will see that the self correlation of the @xmath0 impurity and the rest of correlators with the @xmath1 atoms allows us to naturally establish a relation with the amount of frustration .    in figs .",

    "[ vbscr8ni ] ) , the correlations with the @xmath1 atoms numbered from 5 to 8 are the same as their symmetric counterparts . we want to provide these magnitudes with the meaning of a time - evolved probability and",
    "hence we will consider only their modulus .",
    "it is worth noticing that the time correlators mentioned before , at @xmath47 are real numbers whereas for arbitrary values of @xmath61 they are complex numbers . for convention , in the graphs where we plot the modulus of these correlators we will provide them with the same sign of their real value at @xmath47 to make explicit the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic nature that they possess in the static @xmath47 ground state .",
    "in fact , we can observe in these graphs that the fingerprint of an antiferromagnetic order is present in the initial @xmath47 ground state and shows up in the alternation of the signs of the correlators .",
    "notice also a signal of frustration in the fact that this alternation fails in the @xmath62 and its symmetric counterpart @xmath63 ( due to the reflection invariance of the ring their value is equal with the same sign ) , where the correlations reveal that both spins are oriented in the same direction respect the spin of the @xmath0 .",
    "remarkably this ferromagnetic defect is a consecuence only of the reflection invariance of the hamiltonian .",
    "from these graphs we can also infer that the average correlation of each spin with the impurity is little sensitive to the strength of the coupling constant @xmath8 , although the amplitude of the deviations with respect to this average value increases with it .",
    "the most important observation is that the dynamics of the correlators exhibit a non trivial sort of periodicity .",
    "that is , from the shape of the curves it seems that there exists many modulating components but a dominant pattern of oscillations is apparent .",
    "moreover , the frecuency of this pattern clearly increases with increasing values of the impurity coupling @xmath8 , i.e. as we move towards more frustrated regimes , but not in the same way for all the spins .",
    "we have captured in fig.[fig_oscillations ] the frecuency of the dominant oscillatory pattern of each correlation .",
    "the graph highlights two different tendencies of the correlations depending on the considered spins : the frecuency of the @xmath0 self correlation as well as the correlations of the @xmath0 spin with the @xmath40 and @xmath64 spins increase with @xmath8 .",
    "moreover in the case of the @xmath0 self correlation the relation of these two variables is linear with a surprising accuracy . on the other hand the @xmath65 and @xmath62",
    "are less affected by the impurity spin and the frecuency remains almost constant in the wide range considered .",
    "and @xmath64 have increasing frecuencies with @xmath8 which corresponds to more frustrated regimes .",
    "in particular for the ni spin the relation of these variables is linear up to a high precision .",

    "however , these magnitudes suffice to realize the different nature of both the singlet and triplet ground states : first of all is that not one but two dominant patterns of oscillation are well distinguishable in the triplet regime .",
    "secondly and also a major difference is that the scale in this regime is some orders of magnitude smaller than the singlet case .",
    "the existence of this oscillatory behavior seems natural in a frustrated system where there does not exist a natural equilibrium position for each spin or where the resulting equilibrium configuration may result unstable . in a system composed by classical spins",
    "these oscillations can be interpreted as the necessary movements of each spin to satisfy the frustrated interactions , becoming faster as we blur the concrete equilibrium positions with the frustrating interactions .    the results in fig .",
    "[ fig_oscillations ] point towards a regime where the frustration introduced by the @xmath0 impurity has strong local dynamical effects in the nearest and next nearest @xmath1 neighbors while the rest of the spins perceive the impurity screened by this closer shell of atoms and therefore their dynamics is little affected by it .",
    "these results also show that the correlators proposed to study the frustration of the system indeed have the behavior expected for a suitable estimator in order to measure the intuitive idea we have about the amount of frustration in a certain system .",
    "in recent years , considerable efforts have been devoted to synthesizing and investigating magnetic systems of nano scale dimension that comprise a controllable number of transition metal ions .",

    ", some finite size effects can be observed in the order parameter that reveal a competition between the physics in the bulk of the ring and the strong effects , possibly mediated by the system frustration , that ocurrs in the vicinity of the @xmath0 atom .    in the second section of this paper",
    "we have studied the role of the frustration in such a vbs state by means of computing the real time evolution of the spin correlators between the atoms in the ring . in particular , we have found that the amount of frustration can be related to the frecuency in the oscillatory behavior of this correlators .",
    "this relation can be naturally established from the observation that the oscillations in the system become faster as we move to the more frustrated regime @xmath22 .",
    "such an oscillatory behavior is natural in a system where no natural equilibrium is allowed due to the frustration .",
    "however , the spin correlators reveal that the atoms that are most affected by this frustration are the @xmath0 impurity itself and those @xmath1 atoms that are closer to it , that is cr@xmath67 and cr@xmath68 , while the effect of the impurity strenght seems to be less influent in the cr@xmath69 and cr@xmath70 atoms",
