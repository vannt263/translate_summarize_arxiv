    "in the quark model , all kinds of mesons are classified by the spin - parity quantum numbers @xmath9 .",

    "the p - wave tensor mesons that we study in this paper include isovector mesons @xmath12 , isodoublet states @xmath13 and two isosinglet mesons @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "for these nine tensor mesons , both orbital angular momentum and the total spin of quarks are equal to 1 . because of the requirement of the bose statistics of the tensor meson , the light - cone distribution amplitudes of tensor mesons are antisymmetric under the interchange of momentum fractions of the quark and anti - quark in the flavor su(3 ) limit @xcite .",
    "recently , several experimental measurements about charmless b decay modes involving a light tensor meson ( t ) in the final states have been obtained @xcite .",
    "these decays have been studied in the naive factorization approach @xcite , with which it can be easily shown that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the @xmath18 or @xmath19 current @xcite . the factorizable amplitude with a tensor meson emitted vanishes .",
    "so these decays are prohibited in the naive factorization approach .",
    "the branching rations predicted in the naive factorization approach are too small compared with the experimental results , which implies the importance of nonfactorizable and annihilation type contributions .",
    "the recent qcd factorization ( qcdf ) approach analysis @xcite proved this .",
    "it is worth of mentioning that the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite is almost the only method to calculate these kinds of diagrams , without fitting the experiments .    in this work",
    "we shall study charmless @xmath20 decays in the perturbative qcd approach based on the @xmath21 factorization . due to the heavy mass of b meson , the two light mesons decayed from the b meson are moving very fast in the rest frame of b meson .",
    "the light quarks in the final state mesons are all collinear ; while the light spectator quark from b meson is soft",
    ". therefore there must be a hard gluon to kick the light spectator quark in the b meson to form a fast moving light meson . in this case",
    ", the hard process dominates the decay amplitude , which make it perturbatively calculable . by keeping the transverse momentum of quarks , the end point singularity in the collinear factorization",
    "can be eliminated .",
    "double logarithm appears in the qcd radiative corrections due to the additional energy scale introduced by the transverse momentum . by using the renormalization group equation ,",
    "the double logarithm can be resumed and leads to the sudakov factor , which effectively suppresses the endpoint contribution of the distribution amplitude of mesons in the small momentum region to make the perturbative calculation reliable .",
    "the annihilation diagrams can also be perturbatively calculated in the pqcd approach , which is proved to be the dominant strong phase in @xmath22 decays for the direct cp asymmetry @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , the pqcd approach has successfully predicted the direct cp asymmetry in hadronic @xmath22 decays @xcite and the branching ratios of pure annihilation type @xmath22 decays @xcite .",

    "the dominant contribution is from color - allowed factorizable emission diagrams , while for @xmath276 , this large contribution is prohibited for the above reason .",

    "[ s ] , one can see that our predictions for the @xmath282 and @xmath283 decays are much smaller than that from ref .",

    "the origin of theoretical uncertainties shown in these two tables are the same as those of the branching ratios in table  [ s ] and [ s2 ] . however , the dominant uncertainty here is the third one from the unknown higher order qcd corrections , since the hadronic parameter uncertainty mostly cancels due to the fact that the cp asymmetry is defined as the ratio of branching ratios .    it is easy to see that some channels have very large direct cp asymmetries .",
    "but many of them have small branching ratios to make them difficult for experiments . we recommend the experimenters to search for the direct cp asymmetry in the channels like @xmath334 , @xmath335 , @xmath336 and @xmath337 , for they have both large branching ratios and direct cp asymmetry parameters .",

    "<S> two - body charmless hadronic b decays involving a light tensor meson in the final states are studied in the perturbative qcd approach based on @xmath0 factorization . from our calculations , we find that the decay branching ratios for color allowed tree - dominated decays @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes are of order @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . while other color suppressed tree - dominated decays have very small branching ratios . in general , the branching ratios of most decays are in the range of @xmath4 to @xmath5 , which are bigger by one or two orders of magnitude than those predictions obtained in isgur - scora - grinstein - wise ii model and in the covariant light - front approach , but consistent with the recent experimental measurements and the qcd factorization calculations . since the decays with a tensor meson emitted from vacuum are prohibited in naive factorization , the contributions of nonfactorizable and annihilation diagrams are very important to these decays , which are calculable in our perturbative qcd approach . </S>",
    "<S> we also give predictions to the direct cp asymmetries , some of which are large enough for the future experiments to measure . because we considered the mixing between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the decay rates are enhanced significantly for some decays involving @xmath8 meson , even with a small mixing angle . </S>"
