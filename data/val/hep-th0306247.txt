    "noncommutative geometry  @xcite provides the possibility to describe also ordinary geometries approximating the fields defined on them with finite ( matrix ) algebras .",
    "the archetype of these _ fuzzy spaces _ is the fuzzy sphere  @xcite . along the same lines",
    "other fuzzy spaces have been built @xcite .",
    "there is also the fascinating possibility that the very structure of spacetime at ultrashort length scales might be fuzzy , with a dramatic drop of degrees of freedom at short distances with its consequences on the ultraviolet structure . as additional example matrix models in noncommutative geometry also provide a way  @xcite to ask questions ( for the moment in a toy model ) like the number of points or the average dimension of the universe , questions which was unthinkable to ask in the usual context .",
    "the fuzzy approximation is in some sense similar to the usual lattice one , in that a continuous action is substituted by a model with a finite number of degrees of freedom , thus enabling the possibilities to solve field theories with a approximate path integral formalism . in the limit in which matrices become large",
    "the approximation improves .",
    "however there are some fundamental differences .",
    "one advantage of the fuzzy approximation over the usual lattice is that the basic symmetries of the space at hand are preserved , thus fuzzy spheres are @xmath3 invariant , fuzzy tori are translationally invariant etc .",
    "the original spaces are recovered when the size of the matrices goes to infinity . in this sense",
    "noncommutative geometry , and fuzzy spaces in particular , naturally lead to matrix models  @xcite , which can approximate both commutative and noncommutative spaces .",
    "the study of field theory on these spaces with numerical methods has started  @xcite and seems very promising . in particular",
    "the authors of  @xcite solve exactly , on the moyal plane , a matrix model which has similarities with the one presented in this paper for the disc .",
    "the finite matrix model can also be useful as a cutoff for renormalization , as advocated for example in  @xcite .",
    "the connections between finite matrix algebras coming from a noncommutative plane and finite geometries has been noted in  @xcite in the context of noncommutative chern  simons theory  @xcite as a `` quantum hall droplet '' , while the connection between the projectors we use and the disc appears in  @xcite . a model which has several points in common with ours has been independently developed by balachandran , gupta and krkolu  @xcite in a matrix model which represents the edge currents of a chern ",
    "simons theory on an infinite strip .",
    "the difference between our model and theirs lies mainly in the way the limit is performed .    in this paper",
    "we present a fuzzy approximation to the two  dimensional disc .",
    "we hasten to add that although the root of the approximation lies in noncommutative geometry ( or even earlier , in quantization ) the space of functions being approximated is a normal _ commutative _ space of functions . in the limit in which matrices become infinite",
    "the noncommutativity disappears .",
    "another important aspect of the model is that , while in the lattice approximation the functions , and hence the correlations , can be calculated only at a finite set of points , in the fuzzy approximation presented here approximate functions have values at all points on the plane .",
    "we will argue that the matrix model we present corresponds to a theory on a disc in a variety of ways .",
    "we start in section  [ se : ncplane ] with a brief reminder of the noncommutative plane in the form which is useful for our purposes , which makes evident the map between functions on the plane and infinite matrices . in section  [ se : subalgebra ] we introduce the fuzzy disc , a particular finite matrix subalgebra and we argue that the corresponding functions have mainly support on a disc and decrease exponentially outside it . as the size of matrices increase the boundary becomes sharper .",
    "we also discuss the form that the ultraviolet  infrared mixing takes in this case and argue the presence of edge states . in order to show that the algebra we are proposing actually corresponds to a disc , in section  [ se : laplacian ] we introduce derivatives and laplacians and compare the spectrum of the latter in the continuum and in the finite approximation . in section",
    "[ se : field ] we sketch an approach to field theories on a disc based on the fuzzy approximation .",
    "although the construction is well suited for montecarlo techniques , the correlation of a free massless scalar field can be solved analytically giving the green s function in terms of the inverse of a matrix .",
    "we calculate it numerically and compare it with the exact case .",
    "the final section contains conclusions and outlook .",
    "some technical details of calculations are in the appendix .",
    "we start from functions on @xmath4 , with coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "consider this plane to be like a ` quantum phase space ' , that is that we `` quantize '' @xmath5 and @xmath6 and give them a nontrivial commutator : = i2  .",
    "it is convenient to consider the plane as a complex space with @xmath7 .",
    "the quantized versions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the usual annihilation and creation operators , @xmath10 and @xmath11 with a slightly unusual normalization , so that their commutation rule is =  .",
    "[ aadcomm ] the parameter @xmath2 , which has the dimensions of a square length , plays the role of @xmath12 , but it has no physical meaning , much like the distance between sites in a lattice approximation .    this `` quantization '' associates operators to functions .",
    "there are however ambiguities in this association and in order to give a unambiguous procedure we introduce a map which associates an operator on an hilbert space to a function on the plane . this is a quantization procedure and it was essentially introduced by weyl long ago  @xcite . given a function on the plane",
    "we define a map @xmath13 which to the function @xmath14 associates the operator @xmath15 defined as follows . given the function @xmath16 consider its taylor expansion : ( |z , z)=^tay_mn|z^m z^n  , [ taylorphi ] to this function we associate the operator _ ( ) : = = ^tay_mna^^m a^n  , [ taylorexp ] thus we have `` quantized '' the plane using a normal ordering prescription .",
    "to be precise this map is not the one introduced by weyl ( which associates hermitian operators to real functions ) but can be cast in the same language since _ ( ) = ( |u , u ) e^ua^/e^-|u a/ , where @xmath17 is the fourier transform of @xmath18 .    because of the similarity of its integral expression to the standard weyl map we will also refer to it as the weighted weyl map .",
    "the map @xmath13 is invertible .",
    "its inverse is a variation of the wigner map  @xcite ( the inverse of the weyl map ) .",
    "it can be efficiently expressed defining the _ coherent _ states : a = z  , then it results ^-1_()=(|z , z)=  .",

    "consider the number operator = a^a  , [ defnumb ] and its eigenvectors which we indicate is the same as the eigenvector of @xmath19 with zero eigenvalues , it is not true that the coherent state @xmath20 is the same as @xmath21 .",
    "since we never consider coherent states with integer values we refrain from the introduction of another symbol for the eigenvectors of @xmath22 .",
    "] by @xmath21 : = n  .",

    "note that with our conventions @xmath23 and @xmath24 have the dimension of a length , @xmath22 and @xmath2 those of a length square , while density matrices are dimensionless . applying the dequantization map ( [ omegam1 ] ) to the operator @xmath25 in the number basis we obtain for the function",
    "@xmath18 a new expression , analogous to the taylor expansion ( [ taylorphi ] ) in terms of the coefficient @xmath26 , that is ( |z , z)=e^-_m , n=0^_mn  , [ newtay ] where we used the expression  ( [ znsca ] ) .",
    "the ordinary wigner map of these density matrix elements ( the wigner functions ) can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the maps @xmath27 and @xmath28 yield a procedure of going back and forth from functions to operators .",
    "moreover , the product of operators being noncommutative , a noncommutative @xmath0 product between functions is implicitly defined as ( )(|z , z)=^-1 ( ( ) (  ) )  . [ starint ] this product ( which is a variation of the moyal - grnewold product  @xcite at the basis of deformation quantization ) was first introduced by voros @xcite .",
    "its differential expression is ( )(|z , z)=.e^_|z _ z\"(z)(z\")|_z = z=z\"=+_|z_z+o(^2 )  .",
    "[ stardiff ] we will indicate the algebra of functions on the plane with this product as @xmath29 .    in the density matrix basis , because of  ( [ densmult ] ) , the product  ( [ stardiff ] ) simplifies to an infinite row by column matrix multiplication : ( )_mn=_k=1^_mk_kn  .",
    "although the map @xmath27 is not defined for @xmath30 , using equation  ( [ stardiff ] ) , it is easy to see that , when @xmath31 , the @xmath0 product goes to the ordinary commutative product . a word of caution , the various maps and products defined here have domains and ranges which are not identical .",
    "while the standard weyl map maps schwarzian functions into hilbert schmidt operators , for the weighted weyl map  ( [ taylorexp ] ) this is not always the case .",

    "the main point of the previous section is that the map @xmath27 and its inverse provide a manner to associate to each function , @xmath18 an infinite dimensional matrix @xmath32 .",
    "the price to pay is that the commutative product of functions gets deformed through a parameter @xmath2 . in this section",
    "we define the subalgebras ( with respect to the voros @xmath0 product ) , of _ finite _ @xmath33 matrices . considering the functions",
    "whose expansion  ( [ newtay ] ) terminates when either @xmath34 or @xmath35 is larger than a given integer @xmath1 , it is immediate to see that these functions are closed under @xmath0 multiplication . in the limit of @xmath36 , with",
    "@xmath2 fixed , the noncommutative plane is recovered .",
    "the subalgebra can be obtained easily from the full algebra of functions via a projection using the idempotent function introduced in a similar context by pinzul and stern  @xcite : p^n_=_n=0^n = _",
    "n=0^ne^-  , where we have used the polar decomposition of @xmath37 and  ( [ znsca ] ) .",
    "the finite sum may be performed thus yielding p^n_=  , where @xmath38 denotes the incomplete gamma function . in this notation",
    "it is then clear that , in the limit @xmath39 and @xmath40 with r^2nfixed , the sum converges to @xmath41 if @xmath42 ( namely @xmath43 ) , and converges to 0 otherwise .",
    "it has cylindrical symmetry since @xmath44 does not appear .",

    "cutting at a finite @xmath1 the expansion provides an infrared cutoff .",
    "the cutoff is fuzzy in the sense that functions in the subalgebra are still defined outside the cutoff , but are exponentially damped .",
    "for example a gaussian of width @xmath2 ( corresponding to the element @xmath50 ) when projected , is mapped into itself , and is nonzero on the whole plane .",
    "the map for a normalized gaussian centred around the origin but with width @xmath51 also shows the infrared cutoff .",
    "let us investigate the effect of @xmath48 on some functions .",
    "we use the notation ^n_()p^n_p^n_=_m , n=1^_mne^- and talk of `` fuzzy functions '' for the projected functions so that @xmath52 is the fuzzy identity . at the level of operators",
    "@xmath48 corresponds to the projector p^n_=_n=0^n  .",
    "we call _ fuzzy disc _ the space corresponding to the algebra @xmath53 , which is isomorphic to the algebra of @xmath54 matrices .",
    "this , as a matrix algebra , is the same as the one for the fuzzy torus , the fuzzy disc and any fuzzy spaces in general . in  @xcite the fuzzy sphere is indeed obtained with the use a projector on the voros algebra of @xmath55 .",
    "what makes it a disc are the way to take the correlated limit of @xmath2 and @xmath1 keeping the dimensionful quantity @xmath46 fixed , which we now pass to describe , and the extra structures we will discuss in section  [ se : laplacian ] .    the limit discussed here must be understood in an heuristic sense , since the algebra of functions on the disc is not approximatively finite one would have to consider it in a weak sense , like the way it is done in  @xcite",
    ". a more rigorous analysis on the line of what is done in  @xcite would also be desirable .",
    "it must also be noted that different ways to take the limit give different commutative or noncommutative spaces , as discussed for example in  @xcite .",
    "we first calculate the effect of the projector on a rotationally symmetric gaussian centred at the origin of width @xmath56 .",
    "any cylindrically symmetric function @xmath57 has a simple expansion : ( r)=e^-_n=0^_n  , where @xmath58 can be calculated from  ( [ taylortodm ] ) .",

    "things are very different if we try to localize the function at a distance smaller than @xmath61 .",
    "figure  [ figorigingauss ] shows what happens in such case : for the larger value , @xmath62 , the projected function is undistinguishable from the exact function ( both are actually plotted in the figure ) . for the middle value , @xmath63 , with our numerical approximations , a small `` bump '' at @xmath64 appears .",
    "already for @xmath65 the bump has become a large gaussian sitting at the infrared cutoff ; the part close to the origin is still there , but it is quickly dwarfed by the infrared bump which grows very fast .",
    "for @xmath66 it is already of the order of @xmath67 . keeping @xmath56 fixed and increasing @xmath1 , with @xmath46 fixed",
    ", the bump disappears .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is that the factors @xmath58 in  ( [ gaussseries ] ) become negative and smaller than  -1 .",
    "therefore the individual terms of the series become larger and larger .",
    "keeping the whole series provides cancellations which do not happen truncating the series at a finite value .",
    "in fact the bump becomes negative for @xmath1 odd .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that , with the weighted weyl map , the operator corresponding to the schwarzian function  ( [ ngaus ] ) with @xmath68 is not compact , and hence it can not be approximated by finite rank matrices .",
    "= 2.5 in    = 2.2 in = 2.2 in=2.2 in    [ figorigingauss ]    in general the function @xmath18 is close to @xmath69 if it is mostly supported on the disc of radius @xmath46 ( otherwise it is simply exponentially cut ) and if it does not have oscillations of wavelength smaller than @xmath61 .",
    "it this case the function becomes very large on the boundary .",
    "this is a _ compact _ example of the _ ultraviolet - infrared _ mixing  @xcite which is one of the most interesting characteristics of noncommutative geometry . if we try to localize too much the function , unavoidably an infrared divergence on the boundary of the disc appears .",
    "there are however functions which are localized sharply near the edge of the disc .",

    "the edge states are simply given by the highest one  dimensional projector : ^==e^-  . they are plotted in figure  [ edge ] for @xmath70 and @xmath71 . it is evident that as @xmath1 increases they become sharper .",
    "= 2.5 in    = 2.5 in = 2.5 in    [ edge ]",
    "so far we have defined a projection from functions on the plane to a finite dimensional algebra of @xmath72 matrices and discovered that , with an appropriate choice of @xmath1 and @xmath2 we obtain a good approximation of functions supported on a disc .",
    "but , in the spirit of noncommutative geometry , if we want to talk of geometry , we have to define a dirac operator or a laplacian which give the metric properties of the system  @xcite .",
    "to define derivatives thus we define a pair of operators which act on the same space as the elements of @xmath53 .",
    "their commutators with a function define what we usually call the derivatives of a function . of",
    "course we require that in the limit these two derivations converge to the usual derivatives of the disc . combining them with @xmath73 matrices",
    "would give the dirac operator , to avoid discussing fermions we will concentrate on the laplacian .    the starting point to define the matrix equivalent of the derivations is : _",
    "z&= & [ a^ , ( ) ] + _ |z&=&[a , ( ) ]  .",

    "notice that _",
    "z^n_()^n_(_z )  , the equality obviously holding in the limit . we will use @xmath75 to define the laplacian below .",
    "the fact that we keep @xmath76 and @xmath24 operators on the full space ( hence they are still infinite matrices ) is crucial for the identification of the algebra of @xmath54 matrices with the approximation to the disc .",
    "if we were just to truncate the matrices @xmath76 and @xmath24 , their commutator would not be proportional to the identity .",
    "for the fuzzy torus the derivations can not be expressed as commutators , while for the fuzzy sphere there are three derivations which are not however independent , but are connected by a casimir .",
    "this goes just to say that the same algebra , with different structures , can approximate different spaces .",
    "rotations are well defined , in fact the generator of rotations on the fuzzy disc is nothing but the number operator @xmath22 introduced in  ( [ defnumb ] ) which commutes with @xmath77 just as the generator of rotations on the ordinary disc , the angular momentum operator @xmath78 , commutes with @xmath79 .",
    "just as the fuzzy sphere maintains the invariance group of the sphere , the fuzzy disc retains the fundamental symmetry of the disc .",
    "note that the eigenvalue equations 1= + 1=have no solution in the space of @xmath54 matrices , just as in the commutative case translations on the disc have no eigenvectors .",
    "nevertheless the fuzzy laplacian ^2:=[a,[a^ , ] ] = [ a^,[a , ] ] [ lapladef ] can be defined . in particular",

    "the eigenvalues , @xmath83 , are related to the zeroes of these functions .",
    "more precisely , we have e_mn= ( zeroes r)^2  . in figure  [ figlapl ]",
