    "the observed mass of the higgs boson may imply that higgs self - coupling vanish at a high energy scale in the framework of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "about twenty years ago , ref .",
    "@xcite suggested the multiple - point principle ( mpp ) at the planck scale , and predicted higgs boson mass as @xmath5 with @xmath6 for the top quark mass .",
    "the mpp means that there are two degenerate vacua in the sm higgs potential , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the effective higgs potential , @xmath10 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs doublet , and @xmath11 is the reduced planck scale .",
    "one is our vacuum at the electroweak ( ew ) scale , and the other vacuum lies at the planck scale , which can be realized by the planck - scale boundary conditions of vanishing effective higgs self - coupling , @xmath12 , and its beta function , @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , an asymptotic safety scenario of gravity  @xcite predicted 125gev higgs boson mass with a few gev uncertainty .",
    "this scenario also pointed out @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite for more recent analyses ) .    although ref .",
    "@xcite was able to predict the approximate higgs boson mass , the mpp condition can not fit the observed 125gev higgs boson mass with the recent data inputs .",
    "in fact , within the context of the sm , the mpp condition at the planck scale leads to the higgs boson mass as @xmath16 by using @xmath17 for the world - averaged top quark mass  @xcite .",
    "there have been lots of attempts to realize the mpp at the planck scale so far  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the mpp at the planck scale is achieved by introducing a scalar dark matter and a large majorana mass of the right - handed neutrino . in this case , masses of the dark matter and the right - handed neutrino can be predicted . however , there is a tension from the view point of naturalness , since the higgs mass corrections via the heavy particles well - exceeds the ew scale . actually , it turns out to be quite difficult to realize the mpp at the planck scale while keeping naturalness .",
    "the difficulty is related with the renormalization group ( rg ) running of the higgs self - coupling . in order to satisfy @xmath12 and @xmath13 simultaneously ,",
    "there should exist one or more new particles which change @xmath18 adequately from the sm case . in almost all cases ,",
    "such new particles need to be much heavier than the ew scale , as long as the higgs self - coupling is  continuous \" during the rg running . however , when a new scalar field couples with the higgs doublet and develops nonzero vev , the higgs self - coupling has a tree - level threshold correction  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the correction causes a gap between the higgs self - coupling in the extended model and the one in the effective theory , which is identified as the sm one .",
    "it has been shown that using the gap , the ew vacuum can be stabilized in a scalar singlet extended model  @xcite and type - ii seesaw model  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , even if the new scalar particle is as light as a tev scale , the gap can appear .",
    "then , the model does not affect the naturalness .    in this paper , we will investigate the mpp condition in a scalar singlet extended model , which can be consistent with the 125gev higgs boson mass .",
    "our model is explained in the next section , in which we show the gap explicitly .",
    "numerical analyses of the mpp scenario are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : mpp ] .",
    "we will find that the ew symmetry can be radiatively broken in our model .",
    "we also discuss the naturalness of the higgs mass . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nr ] , we will introduce right - handed neutrinos into the scalar singlet extended model to incorporate active neutrino masses .",
    "we will show that in the presence of the right - handed neutrinos , the mpp scenario can be realized .",
    "it will be pointed out that even if the singlet scalar and the right - handed neutrinos are much heavier than the ew scale , the model might keep the naturalness thanks to an accidental cancellation of higgs mass corrections coming from them .",
    "finally , we will summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we consider a simple extension of the sm with a real singlet scalar field .",
    "the scalar potential is given by  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the higgs doublet and the scalar singlet fields , respectively .",
    "in this paper , we consider the case with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and omit a linear term of the singlet scalar field , which can vanish by a shift of the field .",
    "note that we do not assume an ad hoc @xmath24 symmetry , and then , we will find that @xmath25 plays an important role for the vacuum stability and the ew symmetry breaking . in the unitary gauge ,",
    "the scalar fields are written by @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are vacuum expectation values .",
    "the higgs vev is @xmath10 , and @xmath28 has a negative small value in our setup as will be discussed below .",
    "the minimization conditions of the potential are given by @xmath29 = 0 .",

    "thus , @xmath34 should be much smaller than @xmath27 for @xmath35 .",
    "the nonzero higgs vev induces a tadpole for the singlet scalar due to the @xmath25 term .",
    "if we neglect the cubic term of @xmath21 , eq.([vs ] ) is approximated by @xmath36 for @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "it gives the singlet vev as @xmath39 and its order of magnitude is @xmath40 for @xmath33 . in the no tadpole limit @xmath41 ,",
    "@xmath28 vanishes .",
    "the assumption of @xmath42 seems to be unnatural , but it is necessarily required by the mpp condition as discussed later .",
    "actually , we will find that @xmath43 and @xmath44 also vanish by the mpp condition .",
    "the mass matrix for the scalar fields is expressed by the second derivatives of the potential at the vevs : @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 we identify the lighter eigenstate @xmath48 with the sm - like higgs , and its mass eigenvalue @xmath49 corresponds to the observed higgs boson mass @xmath50 . in our numerical calculation",
    ", we will take into account a renormalization group effect for the higgs mass .",
    "the scalar - mixing matrix is defined by @xmath51 for @xmath52 , the mixing coupling is obtained by @xmath53 , and it must be lower than the experimental bound @xmath54 given by the lhc run 1 data  @xcite .",

    "it can play a crucial role to make the ew vacuum stable like in a scenario in refs .",

    "figure  [ fig : lam_run ] shows that the higgs self - coupling remains positive up to the planck scale , and thus , the ew vacuum can be stabilized .",
    "the mpp condition requires vanishing all scalar - quartic couplings and simultaneously vanishing their beta functions at the uv scale .",

    "<S> we suggest a scalar singlet extension of the standard model , in which the multiple - point principle ( mpp ) condition of a vanishing higgs potential at the planck scale is realized . although there have been lots of attempts to realize the mpp at the planck scale , the realization with keeping naturalness is quite difficult . </S>",
    "<S> our model can easily achieve the mpp at the planck scale without large higgs mass corrections . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that the electroweak symmetry can be radiatively broken in our model . in the naturalness point of view </S>",
    "<S> , the singlet scalar mass should be of @xmath0 or less . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider right - handed neutrino extension of the model for neutrino mass generation . </S>",
    "<S> the model does not affect the mpp scenario , and might keep the naturalness with the new particle mass scale beyond tev , thanks to accidental cancellation of higgs mass corrections .    </S>",
