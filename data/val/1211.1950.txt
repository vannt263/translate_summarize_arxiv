    "as researchers improve their ability to engineer quantum electromagnetic ( em ) devices , we should start to look beyond individual components and find experimental and theoretical techniques that exploit coherent networks of quantum devices .",
    "for instance , it is important to consider whether useful functions are best achieved at the _ network - level _ of interacting , modular , and increasingly generic devices .",
    "this approach is routine in classical electronics .",
    "for example , an unreliable operational amplifier ( `` op - amp '' ) may be combined with a reliable impedance network in a feedback configuration to realize a reliable amplifier .",
    "this strategy is usually more efficient than developing high quality amplifier chips for each new use .",
    "if quantum engineering is to consider this approach , it would greatly benefit from some systemization of device and interconnection laws , in very rough analogy to kirchoff s laws systemization of practical electronics .",
    "because classical network theory has so many established , practical techniques , we might expect that hybrid approaches towards this end may handle network complexity better than approaches entirely native to physics .",
    "feedback engineering addresses two types of problems : feedback can enhance a system s robustness and/or tune the dynamics of an otherwise untunable system @xcite . as a general rule ,",
    "modern quantum em devices feature increasingly monolithic and insular designs , as robustness is generally prized over tunability in single - device physics . in the field of electromechanics ( also known as `` optomechanics '' ) for example , devices in which mechanical simple harmonic oscillators are coupled to itinerant em fields have become increasingly powerful , e.g. @xcite .",
    "mechanical oscillators are more isolated from thermal baths , interactions with distinct em modes are better controlled and quantum effects are starting to be observed @xcite .",
    "but as a consequence , these devices are often module - like and unadjustable : important characteristics like em center frequency and linewidth are often fixed by construction , and often a single em input / output ( i / o ) port admits access to all internal mechanisms @xcite . in principle , tunability may be won back without compromising device integrity by employing a tunable , coherent controller that exchanges continuous coherent signals with this port . just as a reliable , negative feedback network can ameliorate the unreliable gain of an op - amp , perhaps combining a tunable coherent feedback network with an insulated electromechanical circuit may bring out the best of both , and at low cost .    here",
    "we demonstrate a coherent feedback network of em devices , a superconducting electromechanical device @xcite and a superconducting microwave controller @xcite , that provides us with a type of dynamic flexibility previously unavailable in electromechanics .",
    "namely , while previous electromechanical systems make some compromise between better mechanical control and better mechanical measurement capabilities , we demonstrate that this network may be dynamically modulated between both extremes .",
    "while our network is too complex for traditional electromechanical models @xcite , it requires only three components , all of which are accessible to superconducting circuit labs ( and feature regularly in our own work @xcite ) , and is efficiently and intuitively modeled as a linear feedback system . in other words , this network is easy to build ( given familiar technologies , specifically , devices `` generic '' in our lab ) and its mechanisms easy to intuit .",
    "but it is difficult to model quantitatively , meriting methods that naturally handle complex networks .",
    "we do not characterize performance in the quantum regime , but these devices feature regularly in such work and these capabilities are novel regardless .",
    "moreover , because the network is linear and driven by gaussian fields , the network characterization done in the classical regime should apply in the quantum one .",
    "thus , we use the term `` coherent '' in the sense that an interferometer or resonator is coherent , the primary prerequisite for quantum dynamics .",
    "because a systematic network theory perspective is relatively novel in electromechanics @xcite , this article features a pedagogical modeling section that outlines the modeling method and its advantages ( rigorous derivations are well - covered in the literature , e.g. ) .",
    "also , because it employs theoretical approaches developed by an electrical engineering community , familiar concepts in electromechanics are described in more detail than usual .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows , in section  [ sec : network ] we introduce the network construction and its physical intuition .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents our measurements of this network , its essential operation and agreement with the network model .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] describes the procedure for constructing the network model and section  [ sec : con ] concludes .",
    "many superconducting microwave realizations of electromechanical systems consist of a high quality microwave lc resonator ( hereon `` resonator '' ) , in which the capacitance is modulated by a spring - loaded , mechanical simple harmonic oscillator ( hereon `` mo '' ) @xcite .",
    "motion in this mo adjusts the capacitance of the resonator , and thus acts on microwave power in the resonator . and",
    "the voltage potential across the capacitor creates a coulomb force that acts on the mo , and thus microwave power in the resonator acts on the position of the mo . via an inductive transformer ( or some other `` input coupler '' ) , this high - quality resonator couples to a transmission line , which serves as the i / o port through which the electromechanical device is probed , driven and controlled .",
    "these microwave systems are accurately described at a quantum level with a model that is formally equivalent to the models used to describe electromechanical systems of all scales and realizations @xcite .",
    "the choice of an input coupler in an electromechanical system typically represents a compromise . for example , microwave signals inside a resonator leave the resonator more slowly if it couples to a transmission line weakly . as a consequence , microwave signals in resonators with weak couplers",
    "both affect and are affected by the mo more strongly : the weak coupling causes electromechanical effects to integrate for a longer time .",
    "but too much integration can also be undesirable .",
    "for example , weak couplers frustrate high - bandwidth detection of mechanical motion by low - pass filtering mechanical information on em signals leaving the resonator and encouraging loss of the same through parasitic channels . the usual distinction between these two regimes",
    "is whether or not the resonator linewidth @xmath1 is narrower than the mo s center frequency @xmath2 .",
    "more strongly ( weakly ) coupled systems with @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) are known as `` unresolved sideband '' ( `` resolved sideband '' ) systems .",
    "experimentalists typically use resolved sideband systems to control and prepare specific states in mos @xcite .",
    "unresolved sideband systems are most useful when high - bandwidth readout of the mo s motion is the priority @xcite .",
    "sometimes , intermediate regimes are ideal ( @xmath5 ) @xcite . in all electromechanical systems to our knowledge , though , the resonator s coupling strength is fixed at the time of construction .",
    "how might one construct a more flexible system that could be tuned dynamically between the resolved and unresolved sideband regimes ?",
    "our solution was inspired by considering what usually goes `` outside '' emc devices .",
    "many superconducting microwave electromechanical experiments conducted by us @xcite and others @xcite are partitioned into an `` upstream '' electromechanical circuit ( emc ) and a `` downstream '' cryogenic low- or near quantum limited - noise temperature amplifier , for high - fidelity readout of microwave probes .",
    "our group typically uses near quantum - limited josephson parametric amplifiers ( jpas ) for readout @xcite .",
    "jpas are composed of a 20 db directional coupler followed by a single - port `` tunable kerr circuit '' ( tkc ) @xcite , a nonlinear microwave resonator whose center frequency is drive power - dependent and tunable with an applied magnetic flux .",
    "the essential novelty in this work is that rather than measure the signal that comes out of the jpa , a portion of the signal emitted by the emc and passed to the jpa is fed back into the emc coherently .",
    "this feedback gives microwave signals more opportunities to interact with the om , which is the essential quality of a weakly - coupled / resolved - sideband system .",
    "moreover , because the jpa is dynamically tunable , we can choose whether or not this feedback occurs , and access both coupling regimes dynamically . and because the critical components , the emc and jpa , are `` generic '' in our lab , we can pursue this scheme using existing devices .",
    "a ) an experimental schematic of the coherent feedback network .",
    "a microwave tee connects an electromechanical circuit ( emc ) to a josephson parametric amplifier ( jpa )  here broken down into its directional coupler ( dc ) and tunable kerr circuit ( tkc ) subcomponents  and provides an overall input - output port .",
    "the in port is typically driven by a strong electromechanical coupling tone , but this tone is typically cancelled at the dc , preventing its strong carrier from driving the tkc nonlinear .",
    "microwave signals are detected at the out port .",
    "b ) conceptual schematic of coherent interconnections .",
    "ideally , the jpa acts as an over - coupled and wide - band linear resonator with a tunable center frequency . ]",
    "housed in a dilution refrigerator , our network is the interconnection of a single - port emc , a jpa , and a commercial microwave tee ( fig .  [",
    "the emc and jpa are connected to one tee port each , while the remaining tee port serves as the overall i / o network port .",
    "the network output is amplified by a cryogenic hemt for analysis .",
    "while the emc and tkc were originally designed for different experiments and were mounted in separate sample boxes , and interconnections were made using @xmath6cm - length coplanar waveguides and low - loss , semi - rigid coaxial cables , an analogous network could be fabricated on a single si substrate .",
    "although the specific electromechanical circuit ( emc ) used here is somewhat incidental , it is a new design of this type @xcite , built from a 4.672 ghz center frequency and over - coupled @xmath7 mhz lumped - element resonator , employing a mechanical membrane oscillator with an effective mass of @xmath610 ng , center frequency of @xmath8713.6 khz and intrinsic linewidth of @xmath90.81 hz , and in which each photon exerts a force on the mo ( in coherent amplitude units ) of @xmath10 hz . in this report , we do not pump our jpa ; effectively , it is operated as a gain-1 amplifier , or more precisely , as a linear resonator whose center frequency can be tuned by applying either magnetic flux or a moderate amount of microwave drive power .",
    "we do , however , typically employ a cancellation tone that prevents the carrier of any strong , electromechanical coupling tone driving the network from reaching the tkc and driving it nonlinear .",
    "the network s operation is depicted conceptually in fig .",
    "microwave signals leaving the emc and carrying information about the motion of the mo are split three ways at the tee : most of the amplitude is split evenly between the network output and the jpa input , and a small amount is reflected .",
    "modeling the jpa as a linear resonator with a tunable center frequency , the jpa reflects its signal portion with a tunable phase shift .",
    "similarly split by the tee , a portion of the jpa - reflected signal interferes with the emc - to - output signal , enhancing or diminishing the rate of mechanical information leaving the network .",
    "this same interference also enhances or diminishes the effective microwave linewidth of the network , as seen by the microwave input port .",
    "finally , the portion of the jpa - reflected signal fed back to the emc can exert a force on the mo , amplifying or counteracting its motion .",
    "all of these effects are controlled by a single , continuous parameter  the jpa center frequency  and both effects improve as the jpa bandwidth exceeds the bandwidth of the emc and the emc bandwidth exceeds the mo s center frequency .",
    "there are many ways to view this network .",
    "for instance , this network may be interpreted as analogous to a traditional emc , except with a user - controlled knob that modifies the coupling between the transmission line and resonator ( the resonator center frequency may also be affected ) @xcite . the specific network in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b can be viewed a form of microwave stub tuning @xcite , although the jpa bandwidth generalizes the usual model of a `` stub . ''",
    "this network may also be interpreted as a feedback control system : rather than make a room - temperature measurement of the jpa output , this signal is fed back directly to the emc without leaving the cryostat . in this work ,",
    "the first interpretation aids physical intuition , but is not predictive .",
    "the second has a physical intuition and is quantitatively predictive , but is limited to the specific wiring configuration used here .",
    "the third , however , is also physically - intuitive and predictive , but may be applied quite generally .",
    "although it is not our focus here , it is worth clarifying that coherent feedback approaches are distinct from measurement - based feedback approaches .",
    "for example , in a measurement - based version of our system , coherent signals produced by the emc and jpa would be measured by an incoherent controller ( e.g. a computer ) , which would then synthesize new signals that act back on the mo @xcite . while a measurement - based approach can alter the response function of a mo , the system s effective em linewidth is unchanged @xcite . here",
    ", the jpa s transformation of the microwave signal is ideally unitary ( i.e. adds no noise ) .",
    "this network is thus fully coherent and thus fundamentally different from any measurement - based control system .",
    "for example , it has been noted that coherent feedback in the quantum regime can outperform even ideal measurement - based feedback when one considers the cost of the controller s action  a measurement - based controller must act to cancel both environmental disturbances and quantum projection noise @xcite . at a more practical level ,",
    "coherent control systems tend to be physically compact @xcite .",
    "we note that techniques borrowed from network systems theory are vital for tractable modeling of many coherent networks .    many of the demonstrations in the next section are analogous to the widely used electromechanical technique of sideband cooling @xcite .",
    "the canonical sideband cooling system consists of an emc , or some other electromechanical device , driven at a frequency below the resonator s center frequency .",
    "mechanical cooling via this method is usually explained in analogy to early ion trapping experiments @xcite .",
    "a small portion of the low - entropy em drive is inelastically scattered by a mo inside the resonator , with each scattered photon having gained or lost a phonon s worth of energy .",
    "if the center frequency of the resonator is higher than the drive frequency , then more frequency up - converted photons are scattered than down - converted photons .",
    "consequently , the mo gives up energy on average to the em field per scattering event , reducing its motion .",
    "this phenomenon is usually visible through `` blue '' ( up - converted ) and `` red '' ( down - converted ) sidebands to the `` coupling tone '' ( drive carrier ) emitted by the resonator .",
    "a cooling mo is indicated by more blue than red sideband power , less total sideband power , and sideband power spectral densities broader than the intrinsic mo linewidth . to connect our coherent feedback network to sideband cooling",
    ", we point out that there are equivalent , coherent feedback interpretations of these phenomena @xcite .",
    "these interpretations involve mechanically - modulated em signals interfering with the coupling tone , say , at the input coupler .",
    "dependent on this interference , em power is continuously added to or removed from the resonator in such a way to counteract mechanical motion .",
    "the network s response to microwave probe tones is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . by monitoring the network s @xmath11 phase response",
    "( i.e. the phase with which microwave tones are reflected by the network ) we see that the microwave response may be finely tuned using a static , magnetic flux bias applied to the jpa .",
    "viewing the response over a 2 ghz frequency range in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , the jpa center frequency strongly varies with applied flux .",
    "the other visible resonances , the narrow - band emc and very broad - band resonances arising from standing waves resonances between the subcomponents , are only affected as the jpa tunes through them .",
    "focusing on the 10 mhz band around the intersection of the jpa and emc resonances ( @xmath12 @xmath13a flux coil bias , fig .  [ fig2]b ) , we see that as the flux increases and the jpa - like resonance approaches , the emc - like resonance first broadens slightly , then abruptly narrows and shifts higher , then becomes under - coupled , and finally re - broadens and returns to its original center .",
    "these effects indicate that the two device modes are coupling coherently and hybridizing .",
    "microwave - related parameters may be estimated given these 2 ghz and 10mhz probe ranges . using a linear control systems model built from interconnected device models ( employing matlab s control systems toolbox , see section  [ sec : model ] ) , we infer an emc coupling linewidth of @xmath14 mhz and internal loss rate @xmath15 mhz ; a jpa coupling linewidth of @xmath16 mhz and internal loss rate of @xmath17 mhz ; and tee - to - emc round trip phase shift of @xmath18 rad and tee - to - jpa round trip phase phase shift of @xmath19 rad .",
    "these parameters are consistent with parameter estimates from the devices in isolation .",
    "although difficult to distinguish losses internal to these over - coupled devices from interconnection losses , a network model dominated by losses internal to the emc and jpa is more consistent with observations than a network model dominated by interconnection losses .",
    "similarly , the tee is assumed to be ideal and properly terminated , reflecting 1/9@xmath20 of the incident power with a @xmath21 phase shift and splitting the remaining power between the other two ports . with these parameters ,",

    "next , keeping the the coupling tone fixed at the same power and frequency , but varying the flux bias , the mechanical motion inferred from the sidebands varies .",

    "[ fig3]a the apparent mechanical motion is damped more heavily ( sideband linewidth becomes @xmath27 ) , is cooled , and its center frequency moves ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "these effects are analogous to sideband cooling in traditional electromechanical systems @xcite . in our system , these effects may be interpreted as sideband cooling , or as the jpa acting as a coherent controller @xcite , exerting different control laws for different amounts of applied flux .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath29 , the number of photons in the emc induced by the coupling tone , does not change as the tkc ( the tunable component of the jpa ) is tuned . while the network s response to probes and mechanical sidebands varies with the tkc state , the coupling tone is canceled at the directional coupler before the tkc ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) and is thus unaffected by the tkc s center frequency .",
    "more precisely , the mean power in the coupling tone is dissipated in the terminated port in the directional coupler through interference with the cancellation tone , while information - carrying fluctuations about the mean power are not .",

    "this flux bias corresponds to a jpa center frequency 3.4 mhz higher than the coupling tone , and an undercoupled network response with a @xmath34 khz internal loss rate . if internal device losses were lower , this effective internal loss rate would be lower , and the maximum @xmath31 on fig .",
    "[ fig3]b would have been higher .",
    "because the near - resonant coupling tone has no significant effect on the mechanical state when the jpa is far - detuned , it is natural to interpret the jpa as `` controlling '' the mo as it is tuned through the emc . using a control - systems model ( here employing standard - issue mathematica toolkits ) and no free parameters , predictions for the expected mechanical linewidth and frequency shift as a function of flux bias",

    "although we only demonstrate this network s operation in the classical regime , on the basis of the well - known connections between classical and quantum dynamics in linear coherent systems , we expect that the essential mechanisms of the network should work analogously in the presence of unambiguously quantum fields and states .",
    "we have not yet probed the quantum regime because of our use of a hemt ( non - quantum limited ) amplifier for readout and the dynamical richness to be explored first in the classical regime .",

    "first , the tkc may be pumped by a third microwave tone to add a parametric gain - and - squeezing element @xcite ( or a more general kerr nonlinearity @xcite ) into the feedback and read - out dynamics .",
    "recent theoretical work suggests that quantum coherent feedback to an electromechanical system from a parametric gain controller can outperform any type of ideal measurement - based feedback or passive coherent controller @xcite .",
    "second , the ability to dynamically and continuously modulate the network s coupling to its i / o port could be leveraged to shape the waveform of signals read into and out of the emc .",
    "this capability could facilitate high - fidelity coherent state transfer between the mo and arbitrary coherent devices either `` up- '' or `` down - stream '' from the network @xcite . and finally , the model could be considered from the perspective of well - developed theories of classical optimal and robust control @xcite .",
    "such investigations are likely to yield recommendations for a more precisely - controlled network construction . in particular , different applications are helped and hindered by different round trip phase shifts over the emc and tkc network branches .",
    "while these phases were uncontrolled by the use of bulky cable interconnections in this work , a more integrated network could be constructed with much better precision .",

    "<S> we demonstrate a fully cryogenic microwave feedback network composed of modular superconducting devices connected by transmission lines and designed to control a mechanical oscillator coupled to one of the devices . </S>",
    "<S> the network features an electromechanical device and a tunable controller that coherently receives , processes and feeds back continuous microwave signals that modify the dynamics and readout of the mechanical state . while previous electromechanical systems represent some compromise between efficient control and efficient readout of the mechanical state , as set by the electromagnetic decay rate , the tunable controller produces a closed - loop network that can be dynamically and continuously tuned between both extremes much faster than the mechanical response time . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the microwave decay rate may be modulated by at least a factor of 10 at a rate greater than @xmath0 times the mechanical response rate . </S>",
    "<S> the system is easy to build and suggests that some useful functions may arise most naturally at the network - level of modular , quantum electromagnetic devices . </S>"
