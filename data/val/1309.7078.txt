    "since spin lattices are intrinsically nonlinear , the cw driving of antiferromagnetic instabilities has made it possible to create and destroy 1d intrinsic localized spin wave modes in the layered antiferromagnet ( c@xmath0h@xmath1nh@xmath2)@xmath0cucl@xmath3.@xcite additional details on the creation and destruction of ilms have been studied experimentally for macroscopic 1d e&m transmission lines@xcite and micromechanical arrays.@xcite the common thread between the microscopic and macroscopic systems is that after a driven instability generates many ilms , a few become stabilized by locking to the driver frequency .",
    "hysteresis and switching of ilms have been demonstrated for both kinds of nonlinear lattices .    in a 2005 numerical study , eleftheriou and",
    "flach@xcite addressed the problem of whether or not ilms might be observable in thermal equilibrium .",
    "they used a highly simplified monatomic 2d model square lattice having a single scalar degree of freedom at each site .",
    "the interactions comprised nearest - neighbor quadratic and on - site quartic terms . for a fixed temperature the system was thermalized , and molecular dynamics ( md ) calculations were used to generate time - dependent ensemble - averaged amplitude autocorrelation functions which were fourier transformed to produce power spectra .",
    "clear signatures of ilms proved elusive , but by cooling the edge of their 2d lattice ( via dissipation terms ) so as to remove running lattice modes , the authors were able to see the remaining stationary ilms .",
    "they noted that it would be difficult to carry out a corresponding procedure in any realistic laboratory experiment .",
    "thus it was somewhat surprising that in 2009 , inelastic neutron scattering measurements on nai : 0.3 mole % t@xmath4i showed that at a temperature of about 570 k a localized vibrational excitation rapidly appears near the center of the large phonon gap between the transverse optic and acoustic branches , polarized along the [ 111 ] direction.@xcite this observation was interpreted as the appearance of a thermally generated ilm .",
    "subsequent measurements at still higher crystal temperatures showed even more complex dynamical behavior , interpreted as a coherent rearrangement of ilms in the atomic lattice.@xcite    a recent series of numerical studies by dmitriev and coworkers have considered the theoretical question of high temperature excitation of localized vibrations in alkali halide crystals.@xcite employing some of the nonzero temperature md methods of ref .   but using realistic interaction potentials , they argue via simulations on a 2d nonlinear lattice model that the vibrational lifetime of the light atoms in a system with a large harmonic phonon gap grows with increasing temperature , and they interpret this as evidence of ilms .",
    "their calculations did not use the edge - cooling technique of ref .   to isolate the thermally generated stationary ilms .",
    "most recently , inelastic neutron scattering experiments on the vibrational spectrum of nai up to 700 k have been reported with no evidence for a high temperature gap mode.@xcite given the variety of theoretical and experimental results , there is value in reassessing the likelihood of an experimentally significant fraction of thermally populated ilms in alkali halide crystals .    because of the simplicity of the ionic bond in alkali halides , they were one of the first crystal types whose interatomic potentials and vibrational dynamics were well studied.@xcite the result is that the born - mayer - coulomb shell model potentials yield accurate fits to measured phonon dispersion curves.@xcite since the resulting ionic potentials are quite harmonic , ilm production in these systems requires large vibrational amplitudes in order for the nonlinearity to produce dynamical localization . in this report",
    "we examine the formation energy necessary to produce an ilm in the phonon gap of alkali halide crystals , a topic essentially unexplored in the literature .",
    "we find that the necessary formation energy is much too large to produce a measurable concentration of ilms below the pure ionic crystal melting point .",
    "we have computed the formation energy for two ionic crystal models , a 1d model for ki and a previously published 3d model@xcite for nai .",

    "as discussed there , the use of realistic interatomic full pair potentials @xmath5 for ionic crystals , as opposed to harmonic and anharmonic spring models , rules out the existence of ilms with frequencies above the maximum harmonic lattice frequency .",

    "similar to the 1d ki calculation , the complete full energy for this amplitude should be somewhat larger , and the energy curve should grow rapidly with increasing amplitude , just as for the central - particle estimate .",
    "one major difference between our energy results for 1d and 3d is highlighted by the arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , which shows the position of the 1d ki relative amplitude corresponding to the relative frequency @xmath56 of the experimentally measured nai gap mode . within the 3d ilm model for nai , this relative frequency of 0.78 shifts the arrow into a nonphysical region where the relative amplitude would be larger than @xmath57 0.4 .",
    "this would correspond to a huge ilm energy ( note that simply extrapolating the solid squares to @xmath50=0.4 would give a lower bound of 9000 k for the ilm s energy equivalent temperature).@xcite    we have seen that the classical energy @xmath37 needed to create a mid - gap ilm in our 40 particle 1d ki model is of order 300 mev .",
    "we emphasize that this energy is relative to that for the @xmath38 k classical lattice equilibrium configuration .",

    "the idea here is to start from a 1d harmonic toy model with parameters chosen so that the dispersion curve roughly represents that for nai in the [ 111 ] direction .",

    "our aim is to tie the effects on the mode spectrum directly to the number of gap modes without introducing the intermediate step of temperature .",
    "the final step is to track the strengths of the zone boundary mode and the gap mode when a random concentration of na * is present and compare the results with the experimental relative strengths shown in fig . 2 of ref .",

    "the eigenvectors were fourier transformed to obtain @xmath71 . next the force constant impurity was introduced , to reproduce the frequency of the assumed localized gap mode , and this was followed by a series of calculations of the normal modes for different random impurity concentrations .",
    "the harmonic eigenvectors for the defect lattice were fourier transformed and their ft amplitudes were used to generate a perturbed `` dispersion curve '' as follows : for a mode of frequency @xmath72 , the complex square amplitude of its ft at @xmath73 was added to a frequency histogram bin ( @xmath74 ) . the square root of sum of all such contributions was then plotted vs @xmath73 , with the results shown in fig .

    "one sees that the resulting curve is smeared out horizontally due to the fact that many of the modes are localized , so that their frequencies no longer correspond to a single @xmath73 point .",
