    "we conclude that it is a _ robust _ feature , which is not limited to the dipolar single - scattering case . since the scaling behavior is seen in both single - scattering and multiple - scattering conditions , this is a signature of the local arrangement of the particles in the dla clusters .",

    "the case @xmath95 is comparable to the single - scattering result , though it exhibits a shorter guinier regime .",
    "the case @xmath96 emphasizes the appearance of an anomalous power - law for @xmath3 .",
    "+ 6 ) the behavior arising for @xmath76 is completely different . here",
    ", the mean - field approximation is no longer valid ( see table  [ table2 ] and fig .  [ fig1](d ) ) . in that case",
    ", one can see strong scattering in both the forward and the backward directions ( small and large values of @xmath0 ) , which destroys the possible scaling law for @xmath3 .",
    "the tmatrix data analyzed in section  [ s4 ] shows different scenarios for scattering aggregates with fractal dimension @xmath65 and @xmath14 .",
    "this is in agreement with a qualitative argument by berry and percival @xcite who stated that the electromagnetic scattering features _ must _ differ essentially in these cases .",
    "this statement holds true whether the geometric projection of the aggregate on the plane perpendicular to the incident wave direction is compact ( @xmath14 ) , or still a fractal ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the case @xmath65 exhibits rather simple behavior . the scaling relation of the generalized structure factor , @xmath97 , is valid in the fractal regime ( @xmath47 ) for moderate multiple - scattering [ @xmath98 and moderate multipolar feature ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "this confirms the common belief regarding the robustness of the fractal scaling law for @xmath65 .",
    "in the most extreme case that we studied , i.e. , @xmath100 , the backscattering signal is strongly enhanced .",
    "this is related to coherent backscattering of a random system made of small particles @xcite , resulting in weak localization of the wave in the backward direction .",
    "this phenomenon leads to a backscattering cone of enhanced intensity , in particular for fractal aggregates @xcite , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , and to a smaller extent in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ( @xmath101 ) . as it corresponds to a localization event ,",
    "coherent backscattering is not part of the mean - field theory developed in @xcite , thus it is not taken into account in the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath102 , we conclude that the structure factor can be fully explained with the help of the guinier regime , the fractal regime , and the coherent backscattering feature .",
    "in particular , the fractal dimension can be safely extracted from the relation ( [ 0 ] ) , even if multiple - scattering components are not small .",
    "we have emphazised the robustness of the power law exponent @xmath103 in the @xmath3 vs. @xmath0 plot for @xmath65 . the next question that arises",
    "is related to the sensitivity of the fractal domain to a possible enlargement of the backscattering regime .",
    "in fact , the backscattering cone angle increases with the mean free length of the wave scattering in the system @xcite .",
    "thus , the largest backscattering cones are expected to occur for the smallest fractal dimensions , for which the particles forming the aggregate are far apart .",
    "therefore , we performed tmatrix calculations for a linear chain ( @xmath104 ) of spherical particles with an angular averaging , for the same parameters as used previously .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , and should be compared with the exact result of the single - scattering case , which is @xmath105 for the large aggregates of size @xmath17 and @xmath106 .",
    "indeed , multiple scattering is expected to be irrelevant in this case because of the low density of the aggregate , or equivalently the small values of @xmath107 , which are about 3 times smaller than the values for the dlca aggregates . however , the results plotted in fig .  [ fig4 ] show a discrepancy between the single - scattering result ( which is a straight line of slope @xmath108 on the figures ) and the multiple - scattering results - coherent backscattering leads to an enhanced scattering signal upto @xmath109 , hiding the fractal regime .",
    "interestingly , the behavior for @xmath110 can be well represented as an anomalous power - law scaling : @xmath111 with an exponent @xmath89 .",
    "we should emphasize here that this feature is due to the coherent scattering , because it is neither due to special morphology of the aggregate ( the anomalous scaling law is not seen in the single - scattering data ) nor due to the ordinary multiple - scattering process ( because of the small values of @xmath107 ) .",
    "we now have the tools to analyze the seemingly more complicated case @xmath14 ( shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . for small values of the optical size parameter ( @xmath70 ) ,",
    "the multiple - scattering process is irrelevant due to the small values of @xmath107 ( see table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath3 behavior is the same as for the single - scattering case .",
    "the guinier regime is dominant because of the small size of the aggregate . for @xmath71",
    ", one should also recover the single - scattering structure factor because of the small values of @xmath107 .",
    "this is indeed the case while comparing fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) and the corresponding single - scattering figures in @xcite .",
    "the unexpected power - law scaling @xmath111 with the exponent @xmath89 , as seen for @xmath112 , is due to the local morphology of the aggregates , since this is a feature of the single - scattering pattern ( thus of the fourier transform of the correlation function @xmath11 ) .",
    "because of the slope @xmath113 being similar to the dlca fractal slope , it is conjectured that a dlca - like local arrangement of particles is present inside the dla clusters @xcite .",
    "this can be checked directly for the small-@xmath114 behavior of the correlation function @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the present scattering data also strengthens the above conclusion , though the precise value of the slope may be difficult to estimate .",
    "for example , the same exponent @xmath5 has been estimated to be @xmath115 ( instead of @xmath116 ) for composite clusters made of dlca ( @xmath117 ) at short length - scales @xcite , and dla ( @xmath68 ) at long length - scales ( with parameters @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and using the dda code @xcite ) .",
    "the latter case is comparable to our @xmath121 case . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the hump seen for @xmath122 is due to a misfit between the guinier regime for the small values of @xmath0 [ @xmath123 which uses the fractal dimension @xmath124 to obtain the overall gyration radius . also , the dlca - like fractal regime [ @xmath125 uses the fractal dimension @xmath126 for the large @xmath0 .",
    "this hump in the structure factor results in a kind of _ corona _ as appearing for a porous sphere of fractal dimension @xmath127 with a high refractive index @xcite .",
    "the general appearance of the hump for the dla clusters provides another proof that the guiner and fractal regimes are robust against moderate multiple - scattering processes .",
    "to summarize , one can note two special behaviors for larger values of @xmath128 , as described below .",
    "+ 1 ) for @xmath129 , our data is consistent with the fractal dimension @xmath130 , followed by an anomalous scaling law ( slope @xmath113 ) .",
    "the same behavior occurs for the case @xmath131 ( which yields the same value of @xmath128 ) .",
    "the cause of this effect is probably due to the multiple scattering process as evident from the relatively large value of @xmath132 .",
    "however , further investigation is required to understand its origin and behavior . in this particular example",
    ", we can also see the onset of coherent backscattering .",
    "+ 2 ) for the @xmath133 case , the most striking feature is the coherent backscattering enhancement developing for the largest values of the refractive index , for both the dla [ fig .  [ fig1](c ) ] and dlca [ fig .  [ fig3](c ) ] cases .",
    "we have analyzed tmatrix scattering results for three different classes of fractal aggregates ( the linear chain , the dlca and dla clusters ) for various optical size parameters and refractive index in the domain of common applications .",
    "we conclude that the fractal regime , allowing for direct estimation of the fractal dimension , is robust against moderate multiple scattering .",
    "however , its range ( in the @xmath0-values ) can be significantly reduced either by a specific local arrangement of the particles inside the scatterer ( dla case ) or by a coherent backscattering process ( for small fractal dimensions ) .",
    "we provide an explicit criterion to check whether a scattering experiment is in the single or multiple - scattering regime .",
    "we emphasize that the criterion is valid only in the _ fractal regime _ , and not in the forward or backward scattering directions .",
    "thus , we now have a tool to extract the fractal dimension in a controlled way from the scattering data in the fractal regime ."
