    "the development of a fully functional quantum computer has been one of the most exciting topics in recent years .",
    "an important ingredient is the implementation of a quantum data bus that will transport a desired quantum state with high accuracy .",
    "several types of quantum data buses have been proposed : phonon modes for trapped ions  @xcite , cavity photon modes for superconducting qubits and spin qubits  @xcite , and spin chains for spin qubits  @xcite .",
    "the latter are a viable candidate for a quantum data bus since the exchange coupling is native to various solid - state systems based on confined electrons . however , the effectiveness of a spin chain as a quantum data bus depends on the availability and controllability of the spin chain couplings .    in this article we propose a superadiabatic protocol where fast quantum state transfer ( qst ) can be achieved with high accuracy and minimum control across long spin chains .",
    "it has been theoretically shown that by engineering individual couplings in a spin chain qst can be achieved  @xcite .",
    "typically , in these scenarios the qubit - bus couplings are much smaller than the gap between the ground state and the excited state of the spin bus , and qst can be achieved with high precision given initial control assumptions  @xcite .",
    "however , the state transported is time - dependent and high values of fidelity are only found during small time windows . in comparison , in adiabatic qst the evolution time does not need to be precisely controlled , and once the state is transferred , the system stays in a steady state .",
    "adiabatic protocols are also more viable experimentally because of their robustness against weak variations of the system",
    ".    the superadiabatic formalism , in principle , can transform the evolution of any time - dependent hamiltonian into a purely adiabatic evolution . a recent experiment using this formalism in a system comprising",
    "bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices gave promising results for future applications in other areas  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent work on superadiabatic quantum driving has been done in different systems , which illustrates the broad impact of these protocols  @xcite . here",
    "we present the first application of superadiabaticity in the context of qst across a spin chain with minimal control .",

    "the system we consider consists of a heisenberg spin chain with an odd number @xmath2 of spins , coupled to an additional qubit at each end ( see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) .",
    "we refer to the spin chain as the spin bus , to the left qubit as the sender and to the right qubit as the receiver .",
    "we label the sender qubit by @xmath3 and the receiver qubit by @xmath4 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the pauli matrices for the @xmath7 spin in the bus and @xmath8 are the corresponding exchange coupling energies .",
    "under the condition that the couplings within the spin bus are much stronger than those to the sender and receiver qubits , @xmath9 , we can treat the first two terms of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) as a perturbation .",
    "this allows us to project @xmath10 onto the subspace composed of the sender qubit , the receiver qubit and the spin bus ground states  @xcite .",
    "adiabatically eliminating higher energy states of the spin chain , we find an effective hamiltonian given by , to first order in @xmath11 and @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 act on the net spin of the spin bus ground state and the effective couplings are given by the relations : @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ effectivecouplings ] ) @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the local magnetic moments of the first and last spin in the spin bus respectively .",
    "using @xmath20 thus allows us to describe the @xmath2-site spin bus as an ( effective ) spin bus consisting of a single site ( under the condition @xmath9 ) @xcite . by adiabatically evolving this hamiltonian from @xmath21",
    "to @xmath22 the superposition state of the sender qubit is transported to the receiver qubit .",
    "qst can then be achieved using a spin bus with an odd number of sites provided that @xmath9 throughout the evolution  @xcite .    in preparation for the introduction of the superadiabatic protocol",

    "we observe that qst is achieved with fidelities @xmath53 for each spin bus ( indicated by circles in fig .",

    "shows that the fidelity increases from @xmath66 to @xmath67 when @xmath26 increases from @xmath68 to @xmath69 , given @xmath70 .",

    "[ fig3](a ) ) we find an interesting region where high fidelities can be achieved ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "this high fidelity region is not a consequence of an increment in the gap between ground and excited state [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ] .",
    "we suspect that these high fidelities originate from the fact that the energy of the first excited state rapidly varies with time for low values of alpha and becomes time - independent when the fidelity is at its maximum value .",
    "the increase of fidelity with @xmath26 and the appearance of a high fidelity region for @xmath60 is also observed in longer spin buses ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) and for the trigonometric time evolution .",
    "given a time dependent hamiltonian , @xmath75 , it is possible to construct a hamiltonian @xmath76 such that it cancels the non - adiabatic evolution of @xmath75 .",
    "then the evolution of the so - called superadiabatic hamiltonian @xmath77 , is ensured to be completely adiabatic .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath76 is calculated as  @xcite : @xmath78},\\ ] ] where @xmath79 are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath75 .",
    "we could treat the complete spin bus architecture @xmath10 [ eq .  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) ] with the superadiabatic formalism , but this has several drawbacks : the couplings within the spin bus will become time - dependent , the derivation of the superadiabatic hamiltonian will be @xmath2-specific and imaginary matrix elements will be introduced [ eq .",
    "( [ counterdiabatic ] ) ] .",
    "furthermore , these superadiabatic terms consist of many - body interactions which increases the complexity of converting them into experimental knobs as @xmath2 increases . instead , we work with the effective hamiltonian and then map the couplings onto the complete hamiltonian keeping @xmath80 , which , as we will show , eliminates every drawback and reduces the number of superadiabatic many body interaction terms .",
    "we find that @xmath81 contains time - dependent interactions , coupling the states @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "these correspond to an interaction proportional to @xmath86 , which appears in the second - order term of the effective hamiltonian and is @xmath63-dependent @xcite .",
    "since we want @xmath63 to be time - independent in order to allow for minimal control we neglect these matrix elements . as a result , the evolution will not be completely adiabatic .",
    "nevertheless we expect to improve the qst fidelity due to the other superadiabatic matrix elements retained that improve adiabaticity .",
    "we call this hamiltonian `` effective superadiabatic '' and denote it by @xmath87 . since the matrix elements in @xmath87 originating from @xmath88 [ eq .  ( [ counterdiabatic ] ) ]",
    "are imaginary , we apply a unitary transformation @xmath89 such that @xmath90 has only real matrix elements that we can then rewrite as spin exchange interactions .",

    "@xmath89 is determined so that @xmath92 has the same form as @xmath20 [ eq . ( [ effectivehamiltonian ] ) ] .",
    "this imposes the following conditions on @xmath93 and @xmath94 : @xmath95 the new transformed state @xmath96 obeys the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian : @xmath97 where @xmath98 the hamiltonian to apply in the lab frame is the original hamiltonian @xmath10 from eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , using the new edge couplings from eq .",
    "( [ couplings3 ] ) and keeping @xmath99 .",
    "the initial value of @xmath100 for the linear and trigonometric evolution are equal to @xmath101 for both evolutions at least one of the components is unbound for decreasing @xmath33 ; we then do not expect to find high fidelities for short evolution times .",
