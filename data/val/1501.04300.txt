    "a body in which flexoelectrical phenomena are observed always has a finite size . in some cases",
    "the finite sample size is not significant , and the sample can be described as an infinite medium .",
    "examples are the influence of the flexoelectric effect on the dispersion of acoustic phonons @xcite or its influence on structure of ferroelectric domain wall @xcite . in other cases , such as flexoelectric",
    "bending of a plate @xcite , finite size of a sample plays a fundamental role .",
    "obviously , the effects associated with the finite size of the sample caused by the presence of the sample boundary . in particular , this raises the surface piezoelectricity which , as it turns out , leads to the effects of the same order as the flexoelectric effect @xcite .",
    "less trivial fact is that even without surface piezoelectricity , in the presence of flexoelectricity classical theory of elasticity should be modified . in this case",
    "it turns out that , generally speaking , one should use elastic boundary conditions of non - classical form .",
    "these boundary conditions are consistent only if one considers the spatial dispersion of the elastic moduli ( contribution to the thermodynamic potential which is a bilinear in elastic strain gradients ) @xcite .",
    "the latter leads to that not only the boundary conditions , but also differential equations of elastic equilibrium should be non - classical .",
    "equations of elastic equilibrium are needed to describe the converse flexoelectric effect ( mechanical response to the polarization ) . as regards the direct flexoelectric effect ( polarization response to an inhomogeneous elastic strain ) , to describe it",
    "the equations of polarization equilibrium are needed .",
    "it is essential that this equations and boundary conditions for them are modified by flexoelectricity not so radically as the equations and boundary conditions describing the elastic response ( converse flexoelectric effect ) .",
    "this is related to the fact that the flexoelectric contributions to the thermodynamic potential contains only the first spatial derivatives of the polarization , while it contains the second spatial derivatives of the elastic displacements .",
    "equations of polarization equilibrium and boundary conditions for them in the presence of flexoelectricity were derived in paper @xcite .",
    "thus , non - trivial features of flexoelectricity in finite samples reveal themselves mainly in the converse flexoelectric effect .",
    "this is why we do not discuss much equations of polarization equilibrium , focusing mainly on the converse flexoelectric effect at a given polarization .",
    "moreover , in the particular examples ( but not in the general theory ) further we assume a homogeneous polarization at which non - trivial features of flexoelectric effect in finite samples reveal itself most dramatically .",
    "the case of homogeneous polarization is interesting in the sense that a naive analysis based on constitutive equations leads to the ( erroneous ) conclusion that the homogeneous polarization does not cause a flexoelectric deformation of a body .",
    "the consequence of this conclusion is the ability to create a sensor which not behave as an actuator @xcite . such an ability contradicts the general principles of thermodynamics .",
    "but in reality violations of the principles of thermodynamics is not happening , homogeneous polarization does lead to a flexoelectric deformation of the body @xcite .    in the paper @xcite the conclusion that homogeneous polarization leads to a flexoelectric deformation of a thin plate",
    "was made on the basis of the particular ansatz for elastic displacement distribution over the sample and direct minimization of the thermodynamic potential .",
    "a more rigorous analysis of this problem requires the solution of differential equations of elastic equilibrium with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "such a solution for the case of homogeneously polarized ball was presented in the paper @xcite . as was expected",
    "the solution confirmed the presence of flexoelectric strains caused by homogeneous polarization .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the presence of flexoelectricity the exact ( within the framework of a continuum media theory ) equations of elastic equilibrium are too complex to be used for a case differs from a simple case of a ball . even for a ball",
    "the solution is very cumbersome and requires an introduction of non - standard functions presented by a series in powers of radial coordinate . so that the development of approximate method is worth .",
    "such a method was developed in the paper @xcite .",
    "papers on the subject @xcite are too brief .",
    "more detailed description is presented here .",
    "general aspects of derivation of the equations of elastic equilibrium and the boundary conditions for them in the case when the thermodynamic potential depends on higher derivatives discussed in another paper @xcite . here",
    "we apply these results to the case of flexoelectricity and develop the theory further . besides",
    ", it is presented a comparison of exact solution @xcite and the solution of the same problem within the approximate theory @xcite .",
    "some additional examples of approximate theory application are presented also .",
    "it is well known @xcite that within the theory of continuum flexoelectricity is described by a contribution to thermodynamic potential density : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is polarization , @xmath2 is elastic displacement , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are material tensors , @xmath5 , and einstein summation rule is adopted . note that usually strain tensor @xmath6",
    "is used instead of displacement gradients @xmath7 ( distortion tensor ) .",
    "but since @xmath7 is convolved with material tensors which are symmetrical in corresponding indices , it does not matter to write down @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "note also that here it is used definition of @xmath9 slightly different from that adopted in @xcite , pairs of indices @xmath10 and @xmath11 are swapped .",
    "this definition corresponds to @xcite and more widely accepted .",
    "certainly the opposite definition is also applicable .",
    "thermodynamic potential of a body @xmath12 is integral over body volume @xmath13 from thermodynamic potential density . using integration by parts",
    "its flexoelectric contribution can be represented in the form : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is so - called flexocoupling tensor , @xmath16 is surface piezoelectric tensor of special form : @xmath17 hereinafter @xmath18 is unit vector normal to body surface @xmath19 .",
    "note that @xmath16 is different in different points of the surface and it is symmetric in indices @xmath20 .",
    "thus flexoelectric part of thermodynamic potential density ( [ eq : hflx1 ] ) can be reduced to the lifshitz - type form @xmath21 together with additional surface piezoelectricity described by piezoelectric tensor ( [ eq : dijk ] ) .",
    "further effects of surface piezoelectricity are not described so that lifshitz - type form ( [ eq : hflxlt ] ) is used .",
    "certainly besides flexoelectric potential ( [ eq : hflxlt ] ) one should take in account elastic energy .",
    "it will be clear from what follows that besides conventional elastic energy @xmath22 higher elasticity term @xmath23 should be added .",
    "so that total volume density of the thermodynamic potential @xmath24 is @xmath25 .\\ ] ] possible surface contribution to the thermodynamic potential is not considered here .",
    "so that volume integral from ( [ eq : hb ] ) is total thermodynamic potential of a body .",
    "starting from the equation ( [ eq : hb ] ) it is possible to write down the equations of elastic equilibrium and the boundary conditions for them .",
    "in fact , one just need to calculate the tensors @xmath26 @xmath27 and use the results of @xcite . in this way it turns out that `` physical stress '' @xmath28 which obey the equations of equilibrium @xmath29 are determined by equation : @xmath30",
    "boundary conditions for ( [ eq : equilib ] ) can be written in different equivalent forms , one should only substitute ( [ eq : tij ] ) and ( [ eq : thetaijk ] ) to equations from @xcite .",
    "particularly they can be written in the form which coincides with that presented in @xcite : @xmath31 @xmath32 naturally terms contained @xmath33 and @xmath34 do not appear because surface contributions to thermodynamic potential is not described .",
    "it is obvious from ( [ eq : thetnn ] ) and ( [ eq : thetaijk ] ) that if @xmath35 and @xmath36 then generally @xmath37 . so that the limit @xmath35 is singular",
    "this fact explains the above statement that generally in the presence of flexoectricity one should take into account the higher elasticity ( spatial dispersion of elastic moduli ) .",
    "higher elasticity term can omitted only in very special ( and physically doubtful ) case when @xmath38 on the surface of a body . in this special case",
    "one can use classical boundary conditions , additional terms in them disappear .    regarding the description of the direct flexoelectric effect , to obtain the corresponding differential equations and boundary conditions , one should add to ( [ eq : hflxlt ] ) the following expression : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is electric field .",
    "if surface contributions are not considered then it remains only to vary such thermodynamic potential in @xmath41 and to obtain by standard way the following differential equations @xmath42 and boundary conditions for them @xmath43 it does not constitute a serious problem to take into account the surface contributions here . usually such contributions contain only the polarization @xmath41 but not polarization gradients @xmath44 .",
    "this is why to find the change of the equation written above is a simple exercise in this case , in which we are not resting here .",
    "when solving a particular problem it is convenient to use covariant formalism ( see @xcite ) . to transform equations from cartesian form to covariant form one should only change partial derivatives to covariant derivatives and provide an index balance ( only superscript can be convolved with subscript ) . so that equations of mechanical equilibrium and boundary conditions for them take the form : @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 here @xmath48 is covariant representation of unit vector normal to body surface @xmath19 , tensors @xmath49 and @xmath50 are determined as follows : @xmath51 @xmath52 it is also convenient to use curvilinear coordinate system of special class in which equation of body surface has the form @xmath53 . in this coordinate system tensor @xmath54 can be presented in terms of cristoffel symbols @xcite : @xmath55 besides @xmath48 has the only component : @xmath56    for a case of a ball it is naturally to use spherical coordinate system : @xmath57 here @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are cartesian coordinates , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are curvilinear ones .",
    "equation of the ball surface has the form @xmath64 , so that these curvilinear coordinates belong to the special class mentioned above .    instead of curvilinear indices @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67",
    "further it is used also the indices @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "so the letters @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are excluded from notation of `` running '' indexes .",
    "particular cartesian indices are further denoted as @xmath74 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "metric tensor components @xmath75 , its determinant @xmath76 , and cristoffel symbols @xmath77 can be derived directly from ( [ eq : xyz ] ) : @xmath78 other components are zero . since tensor @xmath79 is diagonal , inverse tensor @xmath80 is diagonal also and corresponding components are simply equal to the inverse diagonal components of @xmath75 .",
    "unit vector normal to the surface has the only component @xmath81 .",
    "further one should specify the form of the material tensors for isotropic media .",
    "it is well - known that elastic tensor of such a media is defined by two parameters , say its components @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( voigt notation is used ) , and can be expressed as follows : @xmath84 it is possible to show that flexocoupling tensor of isotropic media can be expressed analogously : @xmath85 for six - rank tensor of higher elastic moduli of isotropic media further it is used a simplified expression @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are constant parameters .    above the expressions of material tensors are presented in cartesian components .",
    "to convert them to curvilinear components one should only change kronecker delta to metric tensor with corresponding location ( up or bottom ) of indices .",
    "if the ball is polarized along @xmath60-axis with polarization @xmath89 then polarization vector has two covariant components : @xmath90 @xmath91    the equations above mathematically completely determine the problem under study . to solve this problem one must first separate the variables .",
    "generally this is done by decomposition of the vector field @xmath92 in a series of spherical vectors . note",
    "that since the covariant formalism is used here , spherical vectors do not coincide with their usual form @xcite .",
    "however , the required form of these vectors can easily be obtained from conventional .",
    "covariant spherical vectors can be defined as follows @xmath93 where @xmath94 is scalar spherical functions expressed in the usual manner in terms of associated legendre polynomials .    in the case",
    "considered here , i.e. when the polarization is homogeneous , expansion in spherical vectors is simplified radically .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that in such expansion of the polarization field @xmath95 there are only the terms with @xmath96 , @xmath97 and top indices 1,3 .",
    "since the theory is linear , it follows that the expansion of the field @xmath92 contains only the similar terms . as a result",
    ", this leads to the fact that @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "this is why one can use a substitution : @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 factor @xmath104 added into ( [ eq : utheta ] ) to make radial function @xmath105 analytical at .",
    "the consequence of using the covariant formalism is that @xmath106 is not a physical displacement in the meridional direction , such physical displacement is @xmath107 , while @xmath108 .",
    "certainly the physical component of the displacement should not have a singularity at the ball center .",
    "note that covariant form of @xmath109 contains the same factor @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the problem is reduced to finding the radial functions @xmath110 and @xmath111 . to find the corresponding differential equations and boundary conditions one should substitute ( [ eq : upsi])([eq : ur ] ) in the above equations and make a very cumbersome but absolutely straightforward algebraic transformations . as the result",

    "further it is convenient to introduce the notation : @xmath211 with this notation the boundary conditions to the classical equations can be written as follows : @xmath212 now all the terms to be further simplified are contained in @xmath213 . carrying out simplification , first of all one should leave in the last term only the partial ( not covariant ) derivatives in @xmath187 .",
    "the reason for this is the same as above .",
    "next , one should express the remaining covariant derivatives in terms of partial derivatives and @xmath188-terms .",
    "the exact expression for the third covariant derivative of the vector is very cumbersome . but",
    "keeping in mind that these third covariant derivatives are convolved with @xmath210 , one can omit all the terms where initial vector is not differentiated at least two times .",
    "so it turns out : @xmath214 with this equation and simplifications mentioned above we get : @xmath215 again , using the fact that to compensate smallness of @xmath210 one needs at least two derivatives in @xmath187 , this equation is further simplified : @xmath216 it is convenient to introduce yet another notation : @xmath217 using the symmetry properties of @xmath218 it can be rewritten as follows : @xmath219 in this notation the expression for @xmath220 can be written as follows : @xmath221 now one can proceed to the analysis of the singularity mentioned above .",
    "it appears in the first and third term of ( [ eq : sdefm4 ] ) , when all the derivatives are in @xmath187 . for all other terms",
    "there is no singularity and one can use the expression ( [ eq : hatuapprox ] ) for @xmath179 .",
    "it is also clear that singular terms exactly cancel each other out because if approximate expression ( [ eq : hatuapprox ] ) is used .",
    "this is due to the explicit form of this expression",
    ". one might think that these terms should simply be excluded , but in reality the situation is more complicated .",
    "the fact is that @xmath222 is equal to zero only for the main approximation for @xmath179 .",
    "but the corrections to this approximation may result in the fact that this expression becomes finite .",
    "henceforth we denote such corrections as @xmath223 keeping notation @xmath193 only for the main approximation . in this notation",
    "it turns out : @xmath224 to compensate the smallness of @xmath218 in the fifth term of this equation there should be at least two differentiations in @xmath225 .",
    "thus , after some reductions one can rewrite ( [ eq : sdefm5 ] ) as follows : @xmath226 it is clear that in ( [ eq : sdefm8 ] ) one should use only corrections @xmath223 of order @xmath227 .",
    "only such corrections yield a contribution of the same order as the other terms . to find the corresponding contributions , we should keep in the exact equation @xmath228 only the terms of the order @xmath229 . indeed if @xmath230 then the main terms @xmath231 and @xmath232 have just such an order . note that although there are terms @xmath233 and @xmath234 in the equation , which are of the order @xmath235 , now they cancel each other completely due to the fact that now @xmath193 denotes the main approximation .",
    "right hand side of ( [ eq : hatuweq ] ) is @xmath236 , so it should be omitted .",
    "the terms @xmath237 and @xmath238 should be omitted by the same reasons .",
    "thus ( [ eq : hatuweq ] ) is reduced to @xmath239 equation ( [ eq : hatuwsimpl ] ) requires further simplification : in the right - hand side we should keep only the terms @xmath240 . for this in the first term there should be one partial derivative in @xmath187 , and in the second term there should be three derivatives in @xmath187 .",
    "this is why we simplify second and fourth covariant derivatives as follows : @xmath241    @xmath242    eventually the simplified equation ( [ eq : hatuwsimpl ] ) takes the form : @xmath243    taking into account that near the body surface the christoffel symbols and material tensors can be considered as constants , the equation ( [ eq : endweq ] ) has a very specific form : all of its terms are differentiated with respect to @xmath225 at least once .",
    "therefore , there exists a particular solution of this equation which obeys an equation with one less derivation : @xmath244    note that in the left - hand side of ( [ eq : endweqred ] ) there is exactly the expression that is needed in ( [ eq : sdefm8 ] ) .",
    "the general solution of the inhomogeneous differential equation is the sum of a particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation and the general solution of the homogeneous equation .",
    "but the remarkable fact is that any solution of the homogeneous equation decaying away from the surface when substituted into @xmath245 yields zero .",
    "so it is quite enough to consider only a particular solution , and one can simply replace @xmath246 in ( [ eq : sdefm8 ] ) by right - hand side of ( [ eq : endweqred ] ) .",
    "having made the replacement , we obtain @xmath220 in the form : @xmath247 elementary transformations lead ( [ eq : snotready ] ) to a rather simple form : @xmath248 where @xmath249 is redefined as @xmath250 this equations together with ( [ eq : bond3m2 ] ) completely solves the problem considered in this section .",
    "remember that in used coordinate system unit vector normal to the body surface @xmath48 has the only component @xmath251 .",
    "so that with respect to the classical part of strain , @xmath252 actually defines the external force density @xmath253 on the body surface , one should only multiply it by @xmath254 .",
    "this is why differential equations ( [ eq : tildeeq ] ) appended by ( [ eq : bond3m2 ] ) correspond to a standard problem of classical theory of elasticity for a body under external forces on its surface .",
    "methods of solution of such problems are well - known and do not require special consideration .",
    "it should be emphasized that physically there are no external forces on the surface .",

    "it is clear that in the terms of functions @xmath267 and the solution is proportional to the previously defined function @xmath142 .",
    "eventually the validity of this statement can be verified by direct substitution .",
    "so that one just needs to find the coefficient of proportionality , it is easily done by using ( [ eq : tildes33ball ] ) or ( [ eq : tildes23ball ] ) .",
    "one can use any of these conditions , they both give the same result : @xmath268 @xmath269 it is also useful to derive the expression for the classical part of the elastic displacement in cartesian components as a function of the cartesian coordinates .",
    "direct conversions yield @xmath270 where @xmath271 @xmath272",

    "in this section we apply the above - described method to find the bending of a homogeneously polarized circular rod of an isotropic material @xcite .",
    "such a rod may be polarized in different directions . however , due to the fact that the flexoelectric effect is linear , we can restrict ourselves to the case of longitudinal and transverse polarization only .",
    "the response of the rod to the polarization of an arbitrary direction obviously is a superposition of responses to the longitudinal and transverse polarization .",
    "besides , axial symmetry allows us not distinguish different directions of the transverse polarization .",
    "as stated above , the classical part of strain is determined by the formal forces on the body surface .",
    "the surface of the rod consists of a cylindrical surface and end surfaces .",
    "first we consider the cylindrical surface of the rod . here",

    "note also that the vector normal to surface has the only component @xmath81 .    by making perfectly straightforward calculations similar to the case of a ball described above",
    ", the following expression can be obtained for the non - classical part of the elastic displacement @xmath290 near the cylindrical surface .",
    "if the polarization @xmath89 is longitudinal along the @xmath74-axis then the expression is as follows : @xmath291 for transverse polarization along @xmath60-axis @xmath290 is determined by the following equations : @xmath292 here @xmath118 is dimensionless radial coordinate , @xmath293 @xmath258 further , direct application of the equations of section [ sec : aprox ] gives the following boundary conditions for the classical part of the displacement . for transverse polarization",

    "boundary conditions ( [ eq : rodbc1 ] ) can be also expressed in terms of the cartesian tensor component .",
    "elementary transformations yield : @xmath296 in this form of boundary conditions it is immediately clear that the total force acting on the cylindrical surface is equal to zero , the integration over the angle turns these expressions to zero .",
    "it also can be easily calculated that the total bending moment of these forces vanishes while integrating over the angle @xmath297 .    thus , not only the sum of formal surface forces , but also the sum of the bending moments of these forces , acting on a small part of the cylindrical surface length , are equal to zero .",
    "this means that the bending moment does not change along the homogeneously polarized rod .",
    "we emphasize that even so , the bending moment appears , but entirely by the boundary effects at the ends of the rod .",
    "so that in the case of homogeneously polarized rod the problem is reduced to the standard problem of the classical theory of elasticity @xcite , i.e. to the determination of rod bending under the bending moments applied to its ends .",
    "certainly the surface forces ( [ eq : rodbc1 ] ) slightly deform cross - section of the rod .",
    "since the main effect is the bending of the rod , we do not discuss this deformation .",
    "note only that qualitatively it is similar to the deformation of the ball in the meridian cross - section .    to calculate the bending moment appeared at the ends of the rod ,",
    "we need to specify the shape of these ends .",
    "we emphasize that we can not limit the rod by planes because this gives sharp edges while the theory requires smooth surface .",
    "we should smooth out these sharp edges , say by a quarter of toroidal surface , or assume that the rod terminates by halves of the ball .",
    "calculations were made for both these variants , and it was obtained the same result . omitting the details of these rather simple calculations , we note only that in the case of spherical ends one can use the results of the previous section . for edges slightly smoothed by the toroidal surface one can approximately describe a small part of this toroidal surface as cylindrical one and use the equations given above in this section . eventually it turns out that the bending moment is @xmath298 the other components are equal to zero .",
    "it is implied here that the rod is transversely polarized along @xmath60-axis and the equation is written for the end in the positive direction of @xmath74-axis . for the other end of the rod",
    "@xmath299 has the opposite sign .",
    "as is already clear from symmetry , for the longitudinal polarized rod there is no bending moment at all , this can be also proved by direct calculations .",
    "such calculations also show that the total force acting on each end of the rod is zero as for longitudinal and for transverse polarization .",
    "equation ( [ eq : myrod ] ) actually solves the problem of flexoelectric bending of the homogeneously polarized rod .",
    "one should only substitute this bending moment into standard equations from textbooks ( see @xcite for instance ) .",
    "in this section we apply the above - described method of approximate calculation to find the flexoelectric bending of a thin circular plate with a radius @xmath300 and thickness @xmath301 , uniformly polarized normal to its plane @xcite .",
    "material of the plate is assumed isotropic . for definiteness",
    ", we assume that the average surface of the plate lies in the coordinate plane @xmath302 .",
    "calculations for the plate are generally similar to those made in the previous section for the rod .",
    "however , most part of the plate surface is flat , so that one can immediately conclude , without any calculations , that the formal forces on this part of the surface are zero .",
    "as in the case of the rod , bending of the plate is determined by edge effects which are discussed below .",
    "thus , for most part of the plate , except for the edges , the classical part of the plate deformation is determined by standard equations without surface loading .",
    "it is well known @xcite that under such conditions the displacements of the average surface of the plate @xmath303 obey two - dimensional differential equation @xmath304 where @xmath305 is two - dimensional laplace operator .",
    "the components of the strain tensor can be expressed in terms of @xmath306 as follows : @xmath307 using polar coordinates it is easy to find an axially symmetric , regular at origin , solution of the equation ( [ eq : bilaplace ] ) : @xmath308 this solution contains a single integration constant @xmath309 which is nothing but the curvature of the plate .    to find integration constant @xmath309",
    "one needs first calculate the components of the strain tensor by means of ( [ eq : uab ] ) and second calculate the components of the strain tensor by means of standard equations @xmath310 .",
    "thereafter it becomes obvious that there is the linear density of the bending moment @xmath311 on the boundary of the plate .",
    "for instance , at the point of intersection of the plate boundary with the coordinate axis @xmath312 this bending moment density is @xmath313 due to axial symmetry @xmath311 is the same at all other points of boundary .    on the other hand @xmath311",
    "can be calculated in terms of formal forces arising due to flexoelectricity on curved surfaces on the plate boundary . as in the case of the rod ,",
    "it is necessary to smooth out sharp edges using one - quarter of toroidal surface ( on each sharp edge ) or one - half of the toroidal surface for the whole boundary .",
    "a small part of a toroidal surface can be considered as a cylindrical one , so that we can apply the equations ( [ eq : foncylcart ] ) ( coordinate system should be rotated ) . for both",
    "variants of sharp edges smoothing it turns out @xmath314 it only remains to equate the two expressions for @xmath311 and express the curvature of the plate in terms of polarization @xmath89 : @xmath315    it is interesting to compare the equation ( [ eq : flexg ] ) with the result obtained in @xcite by direct minimization of the plate energy .",
    "elementary transformations of the equations from @xcite yield the equation different from ( [ eq : flexg ] ) only in that there is 12 instead 6 in the numerator .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that in @xcite it is considered the case when in a thin layer near the plate surface polarization falls to zero .",
    "if , in accordance with calculations presented here , we modify the calculations @xcite to the case , when the polarization is strictly homogeneous , then it appears exactly the equation ( [ eq : flexg ] ) .",
    "a similar dependence on the boundary conditions imposed on the polarization also holds for direct flexoelectric effect , it is discussed in detail in another paper @xcite .",
    "above we have considered the continuum theory of the flexoelectric effect in the finite - size bodies . in the part of description of the converse flexoelectric effect , this theory turns out to be quite complicated .",
    "this is due to the fact that the independent variables are the elastic displacement .",
    "flexoelectric part of the thermodynamic potential depends on the second spatial derivatives of the elastic displacement .",
    "moreover in the case of flexoelectricity the elastic energy should be considered taking into account its dependence on the second spatial derivatives of elastic displacement ( elastic spatial dispersion ) , or the theory is self - contradictory in the general case .",
    "all of this leads to several theoretical problems .",
    "the first theoretical problem is that derivation of the boundary conditions for the differential equations of elastic equilibrium becomes non - trivial in such a case . while the volume integration by parts , which is necessary to express the variation of the thermodynamic potential in terms of independent variates , its appear the surface integrals containing the gradients of these independent variates . needed transformation of these surface integrals",
    "require special mathematical tools .",
    "for this purpose it was offered to use additional surface curvilinear coordinate system or to solve the problem in curvilinear coordinates of the general form from the beginning . from a practical point of view",
    "the second approach is more convenient although it has been proved that this two approaches are mathematically equivalent .",
    "it should also be noted that its appear that the curvature of the boundary surface plays an important role in the boundary conditions obtained in both approaches .    solving the problem of elastic boundary conditions derivation",
    ", we get the opportunity to solve , in principle , any boundary problems needed to describe flexoelectricity in finite - size bodies .",
    "however , the corresponding boundary problems are extremely complex and difficult to solve .",
    "such a boundary problem has been solved for a homogeneously polarized ball but for more complex geometries to make a similar is unrealistic . even for the ball",
    "the solution is extremely cumbersome .",
    "therefore the development of approximate methods for solving such boundary problems is desired .",
    "this is the second theoretical problem .",
    "the problem of developing a method for the approximate solution of the corresponding boundary problems were also solved and the solution is described above .",
    "it turns out that in the framework of such problems elastic displacements can be approximated as the sum of two parts .",
    "the first part was called non - classical , it is concentrated near the surface of the body and decays exponentially inside the body . to find this part",
    "it is necessary to solve fairly simple one - dimensional equations . the second , classical part",
    "is determined by the equations of the classical theory of elasticity .",
    "it turns out that the boundary conditions for this equations have a standard classical form of the boundary conditions for the body under the external forces on the surface .",
    "thus , the finding of the classical part is reduced to the standard classical problem which does not require a separate discussion .",
    "it should be noted that these forces on the surface are formal .",
    "physically there is no forces on surface , formal forces describe the interaction between classical and non - classical part of the elastic displacement . so that these formal forces are expressed in terms of non - classical part of the displacement .",
    "the corresponding equations are given .",
    "it is important to note that for homogeneous polarization the formal forces , describing the influence of the non - classical part of displacement to the classical one , appear only on the curved parts of the surface of the body .",
    "thus , the above statement that curvature of the surface plays an important role gets a clear physical meaning .",
    "note that the body can be , say , a polyhedron . in this case",
    "the formal forces appear only on the edges which can be treated as a limiting case of a curved surface .",
    "while calculating one should slightly smooth these edges and tend to zero the radius of smoothing at the end of the calculations .",
    "the similar approach is applied above for the particular case of the rod and thin plate which also has the sharp edges .",
    "thus , in framework of the theory of continuum the description flexoelectricity in finite - size bodies actually requires special theory .",
    "this theory is described above in detail .",
    "the application of this theory is illustrated in particular problems of calculation of the bending of homogeneously polarized rod and a thin plate .",
