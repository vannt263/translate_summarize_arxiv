    "the origin of bulges is a clue to understanding galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "previously two main scenarios : monolithic collapse and secular formation models for the bulge formation have been proposed . in monolithic collapse scenarios ,",
    "bulges were formed rapidly from primordial gas as well as elliptical galaxies and then disks were grown gradually ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , in secular formation scenarios ,",
    "bulges were formed by redistribution or secular heating of disk stars ( @xcite ) , bar dissolution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , or satellite galaxies falling into the host galaxy center region ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus in these scenarios bulges were formed gradually in disks and consequently do not have uniform age ; the average age of some bulges would be as young as that of disks .",
    "the bulges formed from secular process are called `` pseudo bulges '' ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) in contrast to `` classical bulges '' , which formed rapidly in high - z .",
    "furthermore , @xcite predicted that the bulges of early - type spirals is younger than the bulges of late - type spirals from her semi - analytic merger models of galaxy formation in a flat cold dark matter universe .",
    "the colors and mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath0s ) of bulge and disk are fundamental properties to investigate the origin . in general , both the color index and the @xmath0 are correlated with the age . however , they are also affected by the metallicity ( age - metallicity degeneracy ) ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". moreover , the dust absorption also causes seemingly higher @xmath0 and redder color .",
    "therefore the observations for colors and @xmath0s in a wide wavelength range are needed to resolve the degeneracy .",
    "several galaxy formation models predicting the colors and @xmath0s have been reported .",
    "worthey ( 1994 , hereafter w94 ) constructed the models with various single starburst - age and the initial mass function ( imf ) of @xcite .",
    "he showed that the @xmath0 in @xmath4 band ( hereafter we call it simply @xmath2 band ) depends strongly on the age of the system but is nearly independent of the metallicity .",
    "hence he has recommended the use of @xmath0 in the @xmath2 band to estimate the age of the stellar system .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter bd01 ) and recently @xcite presented the galaxy evolution models with various e - folding time - scale of star formation rate ( sfr ) and various imfs . in the context of their schemes , a shallow slope imf or",
    "a large secondary starburst ( e.g. , 10% fraction of the total stellar mass ) makes @xmath0 smaller than that from single starburst at high - z and steep slope imf , because the shallow slope imf reduces the number of low - mass stars , and the large secondary starburst produces the young stars . comparing the models with the observed disk @xmath0s of the spiral galaxies in ursa major cluster of galaxies , bd01 pointed out that the observed disk @xmath0s are generally consistent with the model with shallow slope imf .",
    "however , the bulge @xmath0s were not explicitly investigated in bd01 .    in order to investigate bulge properties",
    ", the spiral galaxies should be decomposed into bulge and disk components .",
    "moreover , to obtain bulge @xmath0s , accurate rotation curves around the galactic center region are necessary .",
    "previously many authors ( e.g. , @xcite ; ; ; moriondo et al .",
    "1998b ) attempted to obtain the colors and @xmath0s of bulges and disks , and investigated the correlation between @xmath0s and the dark matter mass , and morphological type of galaxies .",
    "the rotation curves used in ( , , ) and @xcite were obtained with h observations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) or h@xmath5 observations of @xcite . however , the bulge @xmath0s may have been underestimated ( e.g. , @xcite ; moriondo et al .",
    "1998b ) , because the rotation curves used in their analyses may not measure the true circular velocity in the central region of the galaxies .",
    "@xcite claimed that the h@xmath5 or other ionized gas rotation curves are often influenced by non - circular velocity component ( e.g. , inflow , outflow or streaming motions ) rather than an ordered circular rotation , thus the rotation curve in inner part ( @xmath61 kpc ) tends to have the slowly rising feature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also , since the h gas can not be well detected in the region of the central a few kilopersecs , the rotation velocity was generally smoothed around the central region by observers , the resulting rotation curves have an apparently solid - body ( slowly rising ) feature ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the @xmath0 is proportional to the square of rotation velocity , the @xmath0 in bulge region is estimated significantly low using the slowly rising rotation curve .",
    "on the other hand , the observation of co line - emission gives more accurate velocity field at the central region of galaxies because co molecular gas , which is one of cold interstellar medium , concentrates in the central a few kpc region and is easily detected in the region rather than h , h@xmath5 or other ionized gas ( sofue 1996 ) .",
    "therefore the co rotation curves should represent more accurately the circular rotation velocity and are more desirable to obtain bulge @xmath0s than other rotation curves . in this paper",
    "we use the co rotation curves of @xcite and partly @xcite .",
    "they observed the co rotation curves around the centers of nearby galaxies with 45 m telescope at nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) with a resolution of 15 arcsec in @xcite and nobeyama millimeter - wave array ( nma ) with 2 - 4 arcsec in @xcite , and connected to h rotation curves for outer regions of galaxies .",
    "the resolution of 15 or 2 - 4 arcsec is not high but enough to discuss bulge properties especially for large nearby galaxies .",
    "indeed , most of the co rotation curves in @xcite and @xcite have revealed steeply rising features , which may be originated from the mass concentration of bulge region , thus the bulge @xmath0 would be higher than previously estimated .",
    "our motivation in this paper is to evaluate accurately colors and @xmath0s of bulges and disks and to study the ages .",
    "first , galaxy images are decomposed 2-dimensionally into bulge and disk models .",
    "@xmath0s for bulge and disk are obtained by the fitting of rotation velocity models to the observational ones . in the rotation curve",
    "fitting , we adopt  maximum bulge plus disk solution \" , which assumes that the inner rotation curve is originated only by the luminous matter .",
    "the method is based on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , these results are compared with the stellar population models of w94 and bd01 .    in next section",
    ", we describe the data and the reductions .",
    "the two - dimensional decomposition method for the galaxy images and the fitting method of the velocity model to the rotation velocity data are explained in detail in section 3 .",
    "we carefully examine the effect of noise and point spread function ( psf ) for the images and the aperture effect on the rotation curve measurement on the basis of monte carlo simulations with artificial galaxies . in section 4",
    "we show the results for the colors and @xmath0s of bulge and disk components of the sample galaxies .",
    "the results are discussed in section 5 in the context of age and formation of the components .",
    "finally we conclude in section 6 .",
    "the sample galaxies are listed in table 1 .",
    "they are basically taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the galaxies in @xcite were chosen that ( a ) the angular size is large enough in order to obtain a sufficiently high linear scale resolution in the central regions ; ( b ) the disk is mildly tilted in order for an accurate correction for the inclination to derive the rotation velocity ; ( c ) no high sensitivity data have been obtained yet with the 45 m telescope or the nma ; and ( d ) the co - line emission is sufficiently strong or iras 60 and 100 @xmath7 m fluxes are higher than several jy ( sofue 1996 ) .",
    "these rotation curves are observed using nro 45 m with 15 arcsec resolution .",
    "some rotation curves ( ngc 4192 , ngc 4535 , ngc 4536 , ngc 4548 , and ngc 4569 ) are taken from @xcite , which targets virgo cluster galaxies using nma with 2 - 4 arcsec resolution . the accuracy of velocity is about @xmath8 for both data of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we searched for the wide - field imaging data corresponding to the rotation curve data as much as possible .",
    "as the result , we obtained the three bands ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ) imaging data from smoka archive system .",
    "the numbers of sample are 23 for @xmath1 band , 24 for @xmath2 bands , and 20 for @xmath3 band .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band images were observed with 105 cm schmidt telescope with a 1k@xmath91k ccd camera at the kiso observatory , university of tokyo except ngc 3198 , ngc 3521 , ngc 4258 , ngc 4321 , ngc 4535 , ngc 4536 , ngc 4548 , ngc 5457 , and ngc 7331 , which were observed with a 2k@xmath92k ccd camera .",
    "the @xmath3 band images for 20 galaxies were observed with konic ( @xcite ) .",
    "the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of seeing is @xmath10 arcsec for all bands .",
    "the exposure time is typically 300s for 1k ccd , 1200s for 2k ccd , and 1800s for konic .",
    "the information of the telescope and the cameras are listed in table 2 .    the data of morphology , isophotal diameter at 25.0 mag arcsec@xmath11 in @xmath12 band ( @xmath13 ) and total magnitude in @xmath12 band ( @xmath14 ) in table 1 are taken from `` the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies '' ( rc3 ) ( @xcite ) .",

    "however , we find that the pas of rc3 are sometimes not suitable for some galaxies from an inspection of model fitting as mentioned in the next section .",

    "some other galaxies also have a bright central point source , however they are not classified as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . hence the nuclear parameters ( central luminosity of the point source @xmath44 , or @xmath45 in magnitude unit ) are added into the bulge / disk decomposition program .",

    "the circular velocity for ellipsoidal bulge is given by ( @xcite ) : @xmath98 where @xmath99 the bulge @xmath0 , @xmath100 the luminosity density at distance @xmath101 from the center in the equatorial plane , and @xmath102 the constant intrinsic eccentricity . to obtain the @xmath100 , we consider the `` strip brightness '' @xmath103 , defined as the integral of the bulge brightness distribution along a path orthogonal to the line of nodes , at distance @xmath101 from the center ( moriondo et al .",
    ". then @xmath104    on the other hand , the circular velocity for exponential disk is given by ( @xcite ) : @xmath105,\\ ] ] where @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the modified bessel functions of first and second kind , respectively , @xmath109 the central disk surface density , and @xmath110 the disk @xmath0 .",
    "the mass of the nucleus is about @xmath111 for ngc 1068 ( @xcite ) and generally smaller than @xmath112 for other spirals ( @xcite ) , which influence hardly the rotation curves at least the 15 or 2 - 4 arcsec resolution of @xcite or @xcite rotation curves .",
    "therefore the contribution of nucleus on rotation curve is ignored in this paper .",
    "the observed rotation curves may be superposed by non - circular motions induced by bar .",
    "the bar - influenced gas flow at a side - on view gives lower rotation velocity , whereas that at an end - on view give higher rotation velocity ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the effect of bar - influenced gas flow is large , most of rotation curves will indicate lower and more gradually rising features , because the probability of looking bar at an end - on view is lower than that at an side - on view ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite reported that most of rotation curves have the steep rise features and there are no significant difference in the rotation curves between the barred galaxies and the normal spiral galaxies .",
    "hence the steep rise feature should be due to mass concentration within the bulge at zero - th order approximation ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the effects of bar is ignored .",
    "there is a massive dark matter ( halo ) in galaxies .",
    "the halo produces flat or nearly flat rotation curves in most galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the pseudo - isothermal sphere model possesses this property , and its density distribution is given by ( @xcite ) : @xmath113 = \\sigma_h/[2\\pi g(r^2+r_h^2)],\\ ] ] where @xmath114 the halo s central mass density , @xmath115 the halo core radius , and @xmath116 the velocity dispersion .",
    "this distribution gives the rotation curve of    @xmath117.\\ ] ]    the dark halo parameters are strongly affected by the observed maximum radius of rotation curve . in this paper",
    "we consider mainly @xmath0 of luminous matter , thus the discussion in the reliability of halo parameters is beyond our scope .",
    "the influence of dark halo blending on the maximum bulge plus disk solutions is discussed in the next section .",
    "the gravitational potential , @xmath118 , of a spiral galaxy is a superposition of the potentials generated by its individual mass components ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , @xmath119    thus we get an expression for the model rotation velocity @xmath120    we use again marquardt method to fit rotation curves . here",
    "the uncertainty of observed rotation curve is set to constant over the full range , because the error size of the observed rotation curve is nearly constant from the center to the end .",
    "we input the uncertainty of 15 [ km s@xmath121/@xmath122 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) to rotation curve fitting , where @xmath123 is the inclination of the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath123 are calculated with @xmath124 , where @xmath125 are axial ratios taken from rc3 .",
    "the parameters used in the rotation curve fitting are @xmath99 , @xmath110 , @xmath116 , and @xmath115 .",
    "the solution of these four parameters obtained simultaneously is called `` full solution '' . however , in practice , the full solution is often singular because the observed rotation curves do not extend far enough to decouple the interdependence of the disk @xmath0 ratio and halo parameters ( @xcite ) . hence @xcite and @xcite devised the method restricting parameters and obtaining the solutions step by step .",
    "the solutions obtained with the method is called `` maximum bulge plus disk solution '' or `` maximum disk solution '' .",
    "we also adopt the method in our analysis . in this method",
    "we assume that rotation curve can be fitted by only visible matter within the radius of two times of disk scale length ( @xmath32 ) , which gives maximum @xmath126 and thus maximum @xmath110 .",
    "thus two parameters ( @xmath99 and @xmath110 ) are determined within @xmath127 .",
    "next , holding the resulting values , we obtain the remaining parameters ( @xmath116 and @xmath115 ) by fitting the full range of rotation curve .    if the observed rotation curve has the slowly rising feature compared to the luminosity concentration of bulge and is well fitted by only disk contribution , the @xmath99 tends to be nearly zero or negative .",
    "in fact , we obtain negative @xmath99 for ngc 3198 in the @xmath2 band .",
    "the effect of beam smearing of rotation curve would cause the slowly rising feature .",
    "since the negative values of @xmath0s are nonsense , we restrict the parameters to positive in the fitting .      in order to examine an accuracy of the rotation curve fitting ,",
    "we construct 300 model rotation curves and then apply our method to the models .",
    "the distances are set to 10 mpc .",
    "the radii of the rotation curves are fixed to 500 arcsec , which corresponds to 24 kpc at the distance of 10 mpc .",
    "these are the typical observations of @xcite .",
    "we select the parameters at random within the following range : @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 .",
    "the ranges of luminosity parameters ( @xmath29 , @xmath33 and so on for each @xmath16 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) input in the simulation are the same as above section .",
    "the ranges of @xmath99 , @xmath110 , @xmath116 and @xmath115 are taken from the typical values in @xcite . here",
    "we show the result with the @xmath29 and @xmath33 for @xmath35 and @xmath2 band .",
    "other cases of @xmath16 or bands are also tried , and the similar results are obtained . using these parameters , the dark - to - luminous ( bulge @xmath68 disk )",
    "mass ratio of model galaxy is within the range of 0.07 ( luminous matter dominating ) to 32.2 ( dark matter dominating ) ( typically about 3 ) , and the total @xmath132 ratio of the galaxy is within the range of 1.0 to 69.1 ( typically about 6 ) .",
    "these values are generally consistent with those of previous authors ( e.g. , @xcite , ) .    the rotation curves in @xcite and @xcite were observed with the angular resolution of 15 arcsec and 2 - 4 arcsec , respectively .",
    "hence the model rotation curves are convolved with gaussian with fwhm of 15 arcsec or 3 arcsec . here",
    "we show the result of the case of 15 arcsec resolution . finally the simulated rotation curves are fitted to the velocity model with the maximum bulge and disk method .",
    "the radius from the galactic center used in the maximum disk method affects the accuracy of fitting . in general",
    ", a large radius would bring a contamination of dark halo , while a small radius would bring a confusion of bulge and disk .",
    "thus we examine radii of 1 , 2 and 3 times of disk @xmath32 .",
    "we confirm that 2 @xmath32 , which was used also in @xcite , gives the best fitting .",
    "therefore we adopt 2 @xmath32 in the following discussion .",
    "figure [ fig.5 ] shows the comparisons of the relative residuals ( ( output@xmath133input)/input ) with @xmath29 or @xmath33 .",
    "the systematic error for bulge @xmath0 against @xmath29 and disk @xmath0 against @xmath33 are clearly seen in the figure .",
    "the bulge error is mainly caused by the disk contamination , while the disk error is mainly caused by the dark halo contamination .",
    "we find empirically that the errors are relatively small for the range of @xmath134 , @xmath135 ( @xmath136 , @xmath137 for @xmath1 band , @xmath138 , @xmath139 for @xmath3 band ) , and @xmath140 .",
    "we therefore reject the results outside the above ranges . for about 6 % of the models ,",
    "the output values of @xmath0s are smaller than 0.1 , which are clearly out of the range predicted from galaxy formation models .",
    "therefore we adopt only the models of output @xmath141 for estimating the error of @xmath0 . using the result of the examination",
    ", we correct the fitting results of bulge and disk @xmath0s for sample galaxies according to @xmath29 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the correction of systematic error of @xmath0s for bulge and disk are not considerably large within the reliable parameter ranges : about factor of 1.0 - 1.3 and 0.9 - 1.0 of originally obtained values , respectively .",
    "the scatterings of bulge and disk @xmath0s within the ranges in our simulation are about 10 - 15% and 6 - 8% , respectively . in practice , since the errors of surface brightness parameters and the residual @xmath50 are added , the errors of @xmath0 for observed galaxies are somewhat enlarged ; about 15 - 30% for both of bulge and disk @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig.6.1 ] shows the luminosity profiles and rotation curves of sample galaxies .",
    "the results of fittings for surface brightness and rotation curve are listed in tables 3 - 5 and 7 - 9 , respectively .",
    "the surface brightness parameters for ngc 1808 ( @xmath3 ) and 4536 ( @xmath3 ) are not obtained because of poor weather condition .",
    "the edge - on galaxy ngc 891 is also not well fitted to any model in all bands because of the dust lane .",
    "the parameters for ngc 4321 and 4535 in the @xmath3 band are unreliable , because they are dimmer than the reliable range of disk central luminosity @xmath142 . the parameters for ngc 2903 , 3198 , 4258 and 4736 in the @xmath3 band may be also unreliable , because the image quality ( @xmath48 ) are relatively low and the values of @xmath20 or @xmath32 in the @xmath3 band for these galaxies are considerably different from those of @xmath1 and @xmath2 band .",
    "we exclude these data in the discussion .",
    "the image of nucleus region for ngc 4736 ( @xmath2 ) is saturated , hence the parameters may be somewhat inaccurate , however the residual of fitting is small .",
    "the results of surface brightness fitting for 22 ( @xmath1 ) , 23 ( @xmath2 ) and 10 ( @xmath3 ) galaxies are reliable and are used in the discussion of the structural parameter , color and magnitude .",
    "the @xmath50 values in the surface brightness fitting turn out to be almost the same among various @xmath34 models of bulge .",
    "thus the @xmath16 is not well determined only by the surface brightness . however , the @xmath50 value in the rotation curve fitting clearly depends on @xmath16 , because the central rising and peak of rotation curve is sensitive to the bulge @xmath16 .",
    "consequently we obtain the @xmath16 by the result of rotation curve fitting .",
    "in fact , the central rising part of rotation curve observed in @xcite and @xcite are well reproduced by the exponential bulge in many galaxies .",
    "the fact that the @xmath143 model is more suitable than @xmath144 model has been reported by other authors ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our results agree with these recent studies .    when bulge @xmath29 and/or disk @xmath33 are larger ( fainter ) than the reliable ranges , the @xmath0s of bulge or disk are also unreliable .",
    "furthermore , the bulge @xmath0 ( and color ) in the galaxy of inclination @xmath145 degree would be influenced by dust extinction and thus unreliable , as mentioned in section 4.4 .",
    "these data are denoted as colon in the tables 7 - 9 .",
    "the bulge @xmath0 for 13 ( @xmath1 ) , 14 ( @xmath2 ) and 5 ( @xmath3 ) galaxies and the disk @xmath0 for 17 ( @xmath1 ) , 21 ( @xmath2 ) and 11 ( @xmath3 ) galaxies are reliable and are used in the discussion .",
    "indeed , the rotation curves are not perfectly fitted with the model , especially for the inner region of ngc 1068 , ngc 2841 , ngc 3031 , ngc 4548 and ngc 4569 .",
    "there would be some reasons for the discrepancy .",
    "one reason may be the gravitation of massive components ( e.g. , inner bar and ring ) other than bulge and disk around the galactic center .",
    "it would be appropriate for ngc 1068 and ngc 4548 ; the former has a ring and another complex structure in the inner region ( rsa(rs)b ) , and the latter is classified as the barred galaxy ( sb(rs)b ) .",
    "another reason would be the low resolution of 15 arcsec for co rotation curves .",
    "it may be valid partly for ngc 1068 , ngc 2841 and ngc 3031 .",
    "the reason of discrepancy for ngc 4569 rotation curve around the galactic center , of which resolution is 4 arcsec ( @xcite ) , remains unknown in this paper .",
    "the more careful and complex method of model fitting for rotation curve should be studied in the future .",
    "the halo parameters are significantly affected by the observed radius of rotation curve from the galactic center ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the radius does not extend far enough to decompose into luminous matter and dark matter , the rotation curve can be fitted with only bulge and disk , and the halo parameters are not well determined .",
    "in fact , the halo parameters for some galaxies are not determined or implausible . since we focus on only @xmath0s for bulges and disks in this paper ,",
    "the halo parameters are not used in the following discussion .",
    "we compare the scale length and bulge effective radius in three bands to check the validity of the fitting .",
    "figure [ fig.7 ] and [ fig.8 ] show the trend of @xmath20 and @xmath32 on the bands , respectively .",
    "the values are normalized for those of @xmath1 band .",
    "only 13 galaxies ( ngc 253 , 2841 , 2903 , 3031 , 3079 , 3198 , 3521 , 4258 , 4321 , 4535 , 5907 , 6946 and 7331 ) are decomposed for all ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) bands and plotted in the figures . those of @xmath3 band for ngc 2903 , 3198 , 4258 , 4321 and 4535 are unreliable as described in the previous section and are connected by dashed lines in the figures . there is no significant trend between the bulge effective radius @xmath20 and the band in figure [ fig.7 ] , while @xcite reported that @xmath20 increases with longer wavelength band , however the scattering is large . on the other hand , the disk scale length @xmath32 generally decreases from @xmath1 to @xmath3 in figure [ fig.8 ] .",
    "the trend has been reported in @xcite .",
    "the decreasing @xmath32 toward the redder bands would be caused by the higher concentration of old stars in the central region and/or an increasing of star formation in the outer disk ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more sample is necessary to discuss the correlation .",
    "to simplify , the pa of galaxy is not the fitting parameter but is fixed to 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 and 150 degree plus the rc3 data in this paper .",
    "each galaxy image rotated with these pas is fitted with the surface brightness model to decide the best pa from the smallest @xmath50 . as the result , the pas for many galaxies are 0 plus rc3 s pa . that is to say , the rc3 data are suitable . the pas for some nearly face - on galaxies do not agree with rc3 data , however .",
    "we adopt the following pas for some galaxies : rc3 s pa plus 30 degrees for ngc 1068 , plus 60 degree for ngc 4303 , plus 90 degrees for ngc 4321 and ngc 4548 , 120 degrees for ngc 5194 and 60 degrees for ngc 6946 .",
    "the discrepancy of obtained pa between our analysis and rc3 for some face - on galaxies would be due to the following reason : the parameters are derived from the luminosity - weighted fitting in inner region of @xmath49 ( corresponding to about 23 @xmath1-magnitude ) in this paper , while the ratio in rc3 is measured at the contour of 25 @xmath12-magnitude .",
    "that is , our results are obtained from inner disk , in which the bar or spiral arms sometimes dominate , while the pa in rc3 is measured at outer disk .",
    "these structure are apparent in face - on galaxies and often cause the discrepancy of the pas .",
    "we compare the model disk axial ratio @xmath28 obtained in surface brightness fitting with the catalogue axial ratios @xmath146 taken from rc3 .",
    "the comparison is shown in figure [ fig.9 ] .",
    "the model axial ratio is generally consistent with @xmath146 in rc3 .",
    "the bulge axial ratio @xmath27 for some galaxies are larger than 1.0 in table 3 - 5 .",
    "that is , the major- and minor - axis for these bulge is reverse against the disk . in other words , the @xmath147 indicates that the pa of bulge is nearly vertical to that of disk",
    ". the @xmath147 would be due to a distorted structure of bulge .",
    "if we construct the model including parameters of individual pas for both bulge and disk , the @xmath147 would not happen .",
    "to simplify , we do not use the parameters of individual pas for bulge and disk in model , however .",
    "when @xmath27 is larger than 1 , the intrinsic eccentricity @xmath148 can not be calculated and therefore the @xmath99 also can not be obtained .",
    "we apply @xmath149 ( assuming spherical bulge ) to calculate the @xmath150 if the @xmath151 can not be calculated .",
    "fortunately , the dependence of @xmath99 on @xmath151 is relatively small ; smaller than @xmath152 within @xmath153 .",
    "therefore the error is not so large even if we assume the spherical bulge , and therefore the uncertainty of bulge pa does not considerably affect the resulting @xmath0 .",

    "the disk @xmath0s in the present study ( @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 ) are somewhat lower than the values of previous researches ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the lower @xmath0s of this paper would be caused by the following two reasons .",
    "the difference of assumed distances changes @xmath0 because it is inversely proportional to the distance . in this paper , the distances for 13 galaxies in table 2",
    "are derived from the cepheid observation .",
    "those for other 15 galaxies are cited from @xcite with @xmath210 @xmath211 .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite used the distances derived with @xmath212 @xmath211 .",
    "if we adopt @xmath213 @xmath214 ( @xcite ) , the average of their disk @xmath198 ratios is about 1.1 ( originally 1.6 ) .",
    "thus the discrepancy is reduced , however the disk @xmath215 in the present study is still lower than @xcite .",
    "the other reason of discrepancy would be the correction of systematic error of the maximum disk solution discussed in section 3.4 .",
    "the corrected value of disk @xmath0 is reduced by a factor of 0.9 - 1.0 compared with the original value .",
    "the bulge @xmath0s in the present study are @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 in @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 band , respectively .",
    "@xcite reported that the average bulge @xmath0 in @xmath19 band ( an intermediate band between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) is 4.6 using optical emission line rotation curves and @xmath216 , which is 3.2 using @xmath213 . in addition , using h rotation curves , @xcite reported that it is 2.9 ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "although the rotation curves used in @xcite were not the co observation , these bulge @xmath0s agree roughly with our result .",
    "moreover @xcite reported that the average bulge @xmath0 in @xmath3 band is 1.1 ( @xmath216 ) , which is 0.76 using @xmath213 .",
    "it is also roughly consistent with the bulge @xmath217 in this study within 1 sigma .",
    "they claimed that the bulges of early - type ( sa - sb ) are younger than disks , however the h@xmath5 rotation curves used in their studies are softened near the galactic center .",
    "the co rotation curves give more rapidly rotation curves than the h@xmath60 rotation curves near the galactic center , hence we tend to obtain the higher bulge @xmath0 than the previous studies .",
    "the other reason would be the correction for the systematic error of @xmath0 ; the corrected value of bulge @xmath0 is about factor of 1.0 - 1.3 higher than that of original value . if the correction is not applied , the bulge @xmath0 is this paper is reduced by a factor of 0.7 - 1.0 , and the discrepancy between our result and @xcite would be reduced .",
    "using color - color diagram , @xcite reported that the bulge colors of early - type ( s0-sb ) are uniformly red and thus the ages are as old as most of elliptical galaxies in cluster .",
    "however , w94 claimed that the colors are not sensitive to age except for extremely young case ( @xmath218 gyr ) and are affected by the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "our bulge @xmath174 is @xmath195 , which is somewhat redder than disk @xmath219 .",
    "therefore our result is not inconsistent with the report of @xcite for the bulge color .",
    "the @xmath0 has the advantage of being more sensitive to age than colors .",
    "hence the color-@xmath0 diagram reveals the spread of age for bulges rather than the color - color diagram .",
    "our result shows that the bulge age is not uniform and that the bulges of earlier - type galaxies are younger than those of later - type galaxies and nearly as same age as the disks .",
    "however , the type of our bulge @xmath0 data is only from sab to sbc .",
    "further observation for s0-sa and sc - sd galaxies are needed to confirm the formation of bulges .",
    "using optical and near - infrared ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) band images , we decomposed the surface brightness of galaxies into bulge and disk components .",
    "we obtained the @xmath0s for bulges and disks with co rotation curves for the inner part of galaxies .",
    "we compared the colors and the @xmath0s with those of galaxy formation models .",
    "we found the correlation between the colors and the @xmath0s for bulges and disks , and that the correlation between @xmath157 and the @xmath0 .",
    "our results are generally consistent with galaxy formation models of slowly star - forming system ; with an exponentially declining sfr and shallow slope imf ( ex .",
    "scalo imf ) .",
    "the exponentially declining sfr taken from bd01 is suitable not only for disks but also for bulges .",
    "moreover we found that the bulge @xmath0s of earlier - type spirals are lower than those of later - type spirals .",
    "these facts suggest that the luminosity - weighted average ages of the bulges in earlier - type galaxies are younger than those of later - type galaxies .",
    "moreover , we confirmed the correlations between bulge parameters and disk parameters as previous authors reported .",
    "in addition there is no tight correlation between the colors and magnitudes for both bulges and disks .",
    "these results suggest that the bulges of earlier - type galaxies would not be the classical bulge but be the pseudo bulge as the secular formation scenarios predict .",
