    "the cern lhc , which is a proton - proton collider with maximal energy @xmath0 tev , has started its operation  @xcite .",
    "the most important purpose of the lhc is hunting for the higgs boson , the last unknown particle in the standard model ( sm ) . the higgs sector is introduced for the spontaneous breakdown of the electroweak gauge symmetry .",
    "weak gauge bosons ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) then receive their masses via the higgs mechanism , and quarks and charged leptons receive their masses through the yukawa interaction . because the sm higgs sector has not been confirmed yet , the possibility of its non - minimal form should also be considered in order to understand the nature of the symmetry breaking .",
    "in fact , it is well known that many candidates of physics beyond the sm predict extended higgs sectors .",
    "for example , supersymmetric extensions of the sm have at least two higgs doublets  @xcite .",
    "successful models based on dynamical symmetry breaking also may require the non - minimal form as the higgs sector in the low energy effective theory  @xcite .",
    "in addition , some of new physics models that are intended to solve the problems which the sm can not explain , such as tiny neutrino masses , essence of dark matter , and baryogenesis , has been built with the extension of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector  @xcite .",
    "there are two basic experimental constraints which an extended higgs sector must respect : those on the electroweak rho parameter ( @xmath3 ) as well as the flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) .",
    "the measured value of the rho parameter ( @xmath4 ) suggest that the electroweak sector of the model would approximately have a global @xmath5 symmetry ( the custodial symmetry ) which guarantees @xmath6 at tree level  @xcite .",
    "for this to be satisfied , a possibility of the structure with ( multi- ) isospin doublets ( plus singlets ) would be natural as the higgs sector . in the sm",
    ", fcnc phenomena are suppressed due to the electromagnetic gauge symmetry and due to the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani mechanism  @xcite , so that the experimental bounds on the fcnc processes are satisfied . in models with more than one higgs doublet ,",
    "this is not true in general , because two or more yukawa matrices for each fermion can not be simultaneously diagonalized .",
    "it is well known that , to avoid such higgs - boson - associated fcnc interactions , each fermion should couple to only one of the higgs doublets .",
    "this can be realized in a natural way by imposing a discrete @xmath7 symmetry  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss phenomenological differences in various models of yukawa interactions under the discrete @xmath7 symmetry in the two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) .",
    "it has been known that there are four patterns of the yukawa interaction depending on the assignment of charges for quarks and leptons under the @xmath7 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "we refer them as type - i , type - ii , type - x and type - y thdms .",
    "the type in the yukawa interaction can be related to the new physics scenarios .",
    "for example , the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is the thdm with a supersymmetric relation  @xcite among the parameters of the higgs sector , whose yukawa interaction is of type - ii , in which only a higgs doublet couples to up - type quarks and the other couples to down - type quarks and charged leptons . on the other hand , a tev scale model to try to explain neutrino masses , dark matter and baryogenesis has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this model",
    "the higgs sector is the two higgs doublets with extra scalar singlets , and the yukawa interaction corresponds to the type - x , in which only a higgs doublet couples to quarks , and the other couples to leptons .",
    "therefore , in order to select the true model from various new physics candidates that predict thdms ( and their variations with singlets ) , it is important to experimentally determine the type of the yukawa interaction .",
    "there have been many studies for the phenomenological properties of the type - ii thdm , often in the context of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , there has been fewer studies for the other types of yukawa interactions in the thdm .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify phenomenological differences among these types of yukawa interactions in the thdm at the lhc and the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite .",
    "we first study the decay rates and the decay branching ratios of the cp - even ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and cp - odd ( @xmath10 ) neutral higgs bosons and the charged higgs bosons ( @xmath11 ) in various types of yukawa interactions .",
    "it is confirmed that there are large differences in the higgs boson decays among these types of yukawa interactions in the thdm . in particular , in the case where the cp - even higgs boson @xmath8 is approximately sm - like , @xmath9 and @xmath10 decay mainly into @xmath12 in the type - x scenario for the wide range of parameter space , while they decay mainly into @xmath13 in the type - ii scenario .",
    "we then summarize constraints on the mass of @xmath11 from current experimental bounds in various types of yukawa interactions .",
    "in addition to the lower bounds on the mass ( @xmath14 ) from cern lep and tevatron direct searches  @xcite , @xmath14 can also be constrained by the @xmath15-meson decay data such as @xmath16  @xcite and @xmath17  @xcite , depending on the model of yukawa interaction .",
    "the @xmath16 results give a severe lower bound , @xmath18 gev , at the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in the ( non - supersymmetric ) type - ii thdm and the type - y thdm  @xcite , but provide no effective bound in the type - i ( type - x ) thdm for @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the cp - even higgs bosons .",
    "we also discuss the experimental bounds on the charged higgs sector from purely leptonic observables @xmath21  @xcite and the muon anomalous magnetic moment  @xcite .",
    "we finally discuss the possibility of discriminating between the types of yukawa interactions at the lhc and also at the ilc .",
    "we mainly study collider phenomenology in the type - x thdm in the light extra higgs boson scenario , and see differences from the results in the mssm ( the type - ii thdm ) .",
    "we discuss the signal of neutral and charged higgs bosons at the lhc , which may be useful to distinguish the type of the yukawa interaction .",
    "the feasibility of the direct production processes from gluon fusion @xmath22 ( @xmath9 ) and the associated production from @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is studied and the difference in the signal significance of their leptonic decay channels is evaluated in the type - x thdm and the mssm .",
    "we also consider the higgs boson pair production @xmath25 and find that the leptonic decay modes are also useful to explore the type of the yukawa interaction . at the ilc ,",
    "the process of @xmath26 is useful to examine the type - x thdm , because the final states are completely different from the case of the mssm .    in sec .",
    "ii , we give a brief review of the types of the yukawa interactions in the thdm . in sec .",
    "iii , the decay widths and the branching ratios are evaluated in the four different types of the yukawa interactions .",
    "section  iv is devoted to a discussion of current experimental constraints on the thdm in each type of the yukawa interaction . in sec .",
    "v , the possibility of discriminating the type of the yukawa interaction at the lhc and the ilc is discussed .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "the formulae of the decay rates of the higgs bosons are listed in the appendix .",
    "in the thdm with isospin doublet scalar fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 with a hypercharge of @xmath29 , the discrete @xmath7 symmetry ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) may be imposed to avoid fcnc at the lowest order  @xcite .",
    "the most general yukawa interaction under the @xmath7 symmetry can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 ( @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) is either @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "there are four independent @xmath7 charge assignments on quarks and charged leptons , as summarized in table  [ tab : type ]  @xcite . in the type - i thdm",

    "masses of up - type quarks are generated by the vev of @xmath28 , while those of down - type quarks and charged leptons are acquired by that of @xmath27 .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm is a special thdm whose yukawa interaction is of type - ii .",
    ".variation in charge assignments of the @xmath7 symmetry . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      at the ilc , we would be able to test the types of the yukawa interactions via the pair production of the additional higgs bosons @xmath26",

    "[ fig : eeah ] , the production cross section is shown for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 gev as a function of @xmath39 assuming @xmath40 in the thdm .",
    "the production rate is determined only by @xmath41 , and @xmath42 at the leading order , and is independent of @xmath20 .",
    "( in the mssm , it depends indirectly on @xmath20 via the mass spectrum . )",
    "the signal of the type - x thdm can be identified by searching for the events of @xmath43 and @xmath44 . when @xmath45 gev , assuming an integrated luminosity of @xmath46 fb@xmath47 , the event number is estimated as @xmath48 @xmath49 in the type - x ( type - ii ) thdm for @xmath43 , and @xmath50 @xmath51 for @xmath44 assuming @xmath52 gev , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this number does not change much for @xmath55 .",
    "the main background comes from the @xmath2 pair production , whose rate is about @xmath56 fb .",
    "the event numbers from the background are then @xmath57 for @xmath43 and @xmath58 for @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the signal should be easily detected in the type - x thdm , by which we would be able to distinguish the type - x from the type - ii ( the mssm ) .",
    "the detailed measurement of the masses of additional higgs bosons and yukawa coupling constants will make it possible to determine the scenario of physics beyond the sm through the higgs physics .",
    "we have discussed the phenomenology of the four possible types of yukawa interactions in the thdm with softly broken discrete @xmath7 symmetry . although the particle contents are the same in these models , their phenomenologies are completely different from each other . in some new physics models , two higgs doublets ( plus singlets ) are introduced with a definite type of yukawa interaction . therefore ,",
    "when additional higgs bosons are discovered , we may be able to distinguish new physics models via the differences between the types of yukawa interactions .",
    "the differences between the types of the yukawa interactions largely affect the decay of the higgs bosons .",
    "we have evaluated the decay branching ratios in each type of thdm .",
    "we have then summarized the current experimental bounds on the models from the data of @xmath59 , @xmath17 , @xmath21 and measurements of muon anomalous magnetic moment .",

    "these processes would provide distinctive four lepton final states @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the type - x thdm , while the mssm higgs sector can be tested by @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",

    "<S> possible models of yukawa interaction are discussed in the two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) under the discrete symmetry imposed to avoid the flavor changing neutral current at the leading order . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that there are four types of such models corresponding to the possible different assignment of charges for the discrete symmetry on quarks and leptons . </S>",
    "<S> we first examine decay properties of higgs bosons in each type model , and summarize constraints on the models from current experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we then shed light on the differences among these models in collider phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we mainly discuss the so - called type - ii thdm and type - x thdm . </S>",
    "<S> the type - ii thdm corresponds to the model with the same yukawa interaction as the minimal supersymmetric standard model . on the other hand , in the type - x thdm </S>",
    "<S> , additional higgs bosons can predominantly decay into leptons . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario may be interesting because of the motivation for a light charged higgs boson scenario such as in the tev scale model of neutrino , dark matter and baryogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> we study how we can distinguish the type - x thdm from the minimal supersymmetric standard model at the large hadron collider and the international linear collider . </S>"
