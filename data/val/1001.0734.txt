    "material at the star - facing surface of dense molecular clouds is intensively ionized by the ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation from nearby ob stars .",
    "the emission lines from recombination of electrons with ions create a bright rim surrounding the star facing surface of the molecular cloud . on the other hand ,",
    "ionization heating drives a strong shock wave into the molecular cloud so that the compressed gas forms a condensed core behind the bright rim , which is the typical structural feature of a bright rimmed cloud ( brc ) .",
    "the formation of brcs opens a window for our investigation on the physical processes involved in the interaction of uv photons with the gas particles in molecular clouds .",
    "the variety of the morphology of brcs has interested both astronomers and theoreticians since the last decade .",
    "most of the observed brcs could be categorized by three different morphologies dependent on the curvature of their bright rims : type a , b and c with an increased order of degree of the rim curvature @xcite .",
    "the curved bright rims of type a , b and c brcs are usually convex having the apex of its rim aligned with the center of the condensed core and the radial direction of the illuminating star as shown by the ic63 structure in both panels of figure [ co ] .",
    "several theoretical models of the uv radiation effect on the dynamical evolution of molecular clouds have successfully re - produced the formation process of the above three types of brcs @xcite , hence we have gained a basic understanding on the mechanism of the formation of brcs with type a , b and c morphologies .    however , there is another interesting type cometary clouds , whose axial line is not aligned with but offset from the radial direction of the illuminating star by an angle @xmath0 @xcite , as shown by the right cap structure of the lower left object in the left panel of figure [ co ] . by a further inspection , one can find that the observed cometary structure is one of the two caps of a bigger cloud structure whose star facing surface is concave to the radial direction of the illuminating star as shown by the lower left structure in the left panel of figure [ co ] .",
    "therefore the symmetrical line of any one of the two caps is neither aligned with the radial direction of the illuminating star , nor the condensed molecular core behind the concave rim as shown by the lower left object in the right panel of figure [ co ] .",
    "this type of cometary structure does not belong to any of the three previously defined morphological types .",
    "quite a few known cometary clouds bear the same structural feature , e.g. , the no .",
    "8 source in ic 1396 @xcite and sfo 80 in rcw 108 @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath1 images of ic59 and ic63 in the same region are shown in figure [ co ] , which also describes an offset angle @xmath0 of the symmetrical line of ic59 from the radial direction of the illuminating star ( for the time being we use the conventional name ic59 for the right cap structure only and later on we will redefine the structure range of ic59 ) . the physical mechanism for the appearance of this type of morphology in molecular clouds , and its relation to the possibility of triggered star formation by rdi have not been fully understood .",
    "although the offset of the apex of ic59 from the radial direction of the illuminating star was tentatively explained as the projection effect of a three dimensional space onto a two dimensional observation plane @xcite , the observed co emission core from ic59 by @xcite , which usually traces the compressed dense molecular materials behind the apex of the bright rim of a brc , does not seem to support this explanation .",
    "the co emission core presented in the lower part structure in the right panel of figure [ co ] reveals a dense core behind the concave rim , which is aligned with the radial direction of the illuminating star .",
    "if the offset angle of the apex of ic59 is a consequence of projection effect , the co emission core should also be subject to the projection effect so that it should appear just behind the apex of the bright rim of the ic59 , as the co emission core in ic63 does , as shown in the upper cometary structure in the right panel of figure [ co ] .",
    "since the center of the co core in ic59 is aligned with the radial direction of @xmath2 cas , it seems more likely that this type of morphological structure , i.e. , a condensed molecular core behind the concave rim which has two apexes at its two sides , is developed during the evolutionary process of a molecular cloud by rdi mode , just as the formation of type a , b and c brcs , whose morphology formation mechanism has been well understood through the theoretical simulations @xcite .",
    "we would categorize this type of structure as type m morphology for its geometrical analogy .    in this paper",
    ", we will explore the possibility of forming a brc with a concave rim by rdi mechanism using our previously developed sph ( smoothed particle hydrodynamic ) code @xcite , and discuss the connection between the appearance of type m brc and triggered star formation within it .",
    "we will structure the paper in the following way : 1.gather the structural and physical properties of ic59 and the illuminating star from available literature and our own observation ; 2.present the simulation results which reveals the formation of type m morphology in the evolutionary process of a molecular cloud by rdi mode ; 3 . discuss the kinematics behind the formation of type m morphology in brcs ; 4 .",
    "discuss the possibility of rdi triggered star formation in type m brcs ; 5 .",
    "derive a conclusion for result of our investigation .",
    "as seen from figure [ co ] , ic59 is one of the pair nebulae in sh 2 - 185 and is at a distance about 1.3 pc from the illuminating b0 iv star @xmath2 cas , which is approximately 190 pc away from us . our understanding on the physical properties of ic59 is gradually improved with the availability of the progressively advanced observing facilities .",
    "ic59 was once defined as a reflection nebula @xcite for there was little molecular emission detected @xcite especially when compared with that of its neighbor ic63 in the same region .",
    "later the radio continuum and hi study by @xcite revealed the existence of atomic hydrogen in ic59 , which were produced through the dissociation of h@xmath3 , thus ic59 was taken as an emission nebula .",
    "the multiwavelength investigation on ic59 @xcite confirmed the presence of h@xmath3 in ic59 and its similarity to ic63 in other spectrum features except that an ionization front ( a bright rim ) in ic59 was not clearly detected .",
    "recently we obtained h@xmath4 images with the wide field grism spectrograph 2 ( uehara et al . 1994 ) and tektronix 2048 @xmath5 2048 ccd mounted on the university of hawaii",
    "2.2-m telescope on 2009 september 10 ut .",
    "it is seen from figure [ alpha ] that around the star facing side of the nebula , a bright rim covers the east cap , the concave surface and the west cap .",
    "the brightest part of the rim is the concave part whose center is aligned with the radial direction of the star so that it receives stronger uv radiation than the surfaces around the two side - caps",
    ". therefore it seems more reasonable to consider the two apexes and the concave part as one whole piece of the nebula structure and name it as ic59 , rather than the east part only .",
    "we will use this new definition of ic59 in our following discussions . with the position of co emission core in ic59 defined by @xcite and the latest h@xmath1 image of ic59 we obtained",
    ", we believe that we have gathered enough evidence to ascertain that the newly defined ic59 structure should be a type of brc structure with type m morphology , although which has never been investigated .",
    "the geometrical and physical parameters we can collect from different literature s for the east cap of ic59 are as follows . the width of the cap @xmath6 0.18 pc ; length @xmath7 0.12 pc @xcite where the dimensions are defined by the convention for brcs @xcite ; its column density is @xmath8@xmath9 @xcite ; the ionization flux at the star facing surface of ic59 is @xmath10@xmath9s@xmath11 , under the premise that @xmath2 cas is a b0 star with a temperature 33,340 k @xcite .",
    "an average temperature of the east cap of ic59 is estimated as @xmath12 k @xcite .",
    "the above collected properties of ic59 are used as a guidence for the selection of an appropriate candidate from our simulation experiment in order for us to address the formation mechanism of type m brc from an initially uniform molecular cloud .",
    "we run our sph code ( named as newcloud ) for molecular clouds of different initial conditions . from the results obtained ,",
    "we are able to reveal the possible origin and future evolution of ic59 , and especially address the possibility of rdi triggered star formation within ic59 and other similar brcs .",
    "it is our intention to focus on the formation mechanism of type m brcs in this investigation , therefore the properties of ic63 is not included in our investigation , for which we will address its physical properties and evolutionary features in a separate paper in preparation .",
    "the sph code we developed @xcite solves the compressible fluid dynamic equations , with inclusion of self - gravity of the cloud , the most important heating and cooling processes plus a chemical network of 12 basic chemical components in brcs , which has been fully explained in our previous two papers and will not be repeated here .",
    "interested readers could read the above two cited papers to know the details of the code .",
    "the radiation fields consists of an standard isotropic interstellar background radiation ( with photon s energy between 6.4 and 13.6 ev)@xcite and a uv radiation field from nearby star ( with photon s energy higher than the hydrogen ionizing energy of 13.6 ev ) .",
    "the cloud is initially situated at the center of a @xmath13 coordinate and the uv radiation is set along @xmath14 direction and incident on the surface of the upper hemisphere of the simulated cloud , with a constant energy flux @xmath15 specified in the last section .",
    "the simulated cloud is initially situated in a warm and defuse interstellar medium , which is assumed to compose primarily of atomic hydrogen with @xmath16(hi ) = 10 @xmath17 and @xmath18 = 100 k @xcite .",
    "the molecular cloud is of an initial temperature of 60 k , mass of 2 m@xmath19 and a radius of 1.4 pc ( corresponding to an initial number density @xmath20(h@xmath3 ) = 3.48 cm @xmath21 , which is within the observed range of volume densities of star forming molecular clouds @xcite ) in all of the simulations presented in the following , 20,000 particles are used .",
    "the hydrogen number density profile in the up - left panel in figure [ den ] shows that 0.47 my after the radiation fields were switched on , the initially spherical cloud evolved into a type a brc having its front surface ( star facing side ) squashed from a hemispherical surface and a maximum density of 30 @xmath17 was achieved at the head of the upper hemisphere as a consequence of uv radiation induced shock propogation into the cloud , whose physical implications have been fully understood @xcite .",
    "the up - middle and -right panels show that the front surface of the cloud gets more squashed at @xmath22 my and then become very flat at @xmath23 my , whilst a more and more condensed core appeared with a centre density of 136 @xmath17 at t = 0.83 my .",
    "when @xmath24 my , the front surface of the cloud started to become concave to the radial direction of the star which is above the cloud at positive @xmath25 axis .",
    "a further condensed core formed behind the concave surface and had a centre density of 1127 @xmath17 .",
    "the degree of concavity of the front surface got enhanced at @xmath26 my .",
    "it is seen from the bottom - middle panel in figure [ den ] , that the morphology of the cloud structure is very similar to the observed morphology of ic59 as shown in both panels in figure [ alpha ] , i.e. , a concave surface whose center is aligned with @xmath25 axis ( the radial direction of the star ) , is in between two caps whose geometrical symmetrical line is offset an angle from the @xmath25 axis .",
    "thus a type m brc has formed and the centre density of the core behind the concave part of the rim is 807 @xmath17 which is less denser than that at @xmath24 my .",
    "it is obviously seen that the core behind the concave surface expanded in volume from @xmath24 to @xmath26 my , therefore the centre density of the core decreased .",
    "the bottom right panel in figure [ den ] shows that the whole structure retained a type m morphology but further expanded at @xmath27 my and the centre density of the core further decreased to 581 @xmath17 .",
    "further simulation sequences after @xmath27 tells the whole structure contines expansion and finally expands away as large piece of very defused cloud at @xmath28 my .",
    "taking any one of two caps in the formed type m brc at @xmath26 my as an example , we can estimate its average column density and then compare it with the observational data .",
    "we take the east cap structure in the middle - bottom panel of figure [ den ] as the corresponding structure previously defined as ic59 by astronomers .",
    "simulation result revealed that the structure of the east cap has a mass of @xmath29 m@xmath19 .",
    "if we assume the mass distributes uniformly in a cap of a sphere of height 0.13 pc and radius 0.10 pc according to the simulated dimension , which is very close to the measurement ( 0.12 , 0.09 ) pc by @xcite , a minimum value of the column density @xmath30 @xmath9 is derived which is consistent with the observed value of @xmath31 @xmath9@xcite .",
    "the result for the west cap is similar to the east cap .",
    "a qualitative analysis on the kinematics of the evolution of the cloud would reveal a physical picture for the formation of type m brc .",
    "the cloud is not strongly bound by self - gravity since it has an initial jeans number @xmath4 ( the ratio of the gravitational to the thermal energies ) of 0.025 which is far from the value of 1 , the necessary condition for a molecular cloud to be unstable to gravitational collapse .",
    "after the initial stage of the evolution , the head of the front hemisphere of the cloud is modestly compressed at @xmath32 my so that the gravitational center of the cloud has moved to the head of the upper hemisphere as shown in the up - middle panel in figure [ den ] .",
    "the gas particles at the apex and off - apex points on the surface of the upper hemisphere have approximately similar gravitational acceleration , hence similar radial velocity @xmath33 as illustrated in figure [ vel ] by the solid arrowed lines .",
    "one the other hand , the uv radiation induced shock velocity @xmath34 ( by the dot arrowed lines in figure [ vel ] ) at the point ( @xmath35 ) on the front surface is given by @xcite , @xmath36 where @xmath0 is the angle of a surface point from @xmath25 axis and @xmath37 for all of positions at the front surface of the upper hemisphere of the cloud ; @xmath38 is the shock velocity at the apex @xmath39 and @xmath40^{1/2}$ ] with @xmath16 being the number density of the site @xcite .    for the molecular cloud we simulated , because of its very low initial density , the shock velocity @xmath38 is one order of magnitude higher and the radial velocity @xmath33 is much lower than that in those clouds in which type a , b and c brcs formed with a high probability of triggered star formation in their shocked cores @xcite . therefore the total velocity @xmath41 ( by the dot - dash arrowed lines in figure [ vel ] ) of a gas particle at the front surface forms a very small angle @xmath42 from the direction of @xmath43 as shown by figure [ vel ] , so that @xmath41 is actually dominated by the component @xmath44 which is dependent on the angular distance @xmath0 of the position from @xmath25 axis .",
    "consequently @xmath41 is determined by @xmath0 and will decrease with @xmath0 .",
    "now it is clear that the gas particles at the apex of the front surface have the highest total velocity @xmath45 whose direction is aligned with @xmath14 axis as shown by figure [ vel ] .",
    "after some period of time , the gas particles at or close to the apex of the front surface are in advance of the particles at two sides of the apex along @xmath14 axis , which results in formation of a concave surface on the star facing side of the molecular cloud as shown by the lower left , middle and right panels in figure [ den ] .",
    "figure [ denco ] displays a sequence of formation of a co core behind the concave surface .",
    "simulation data reveals that the fractional concentration @xmath46 varied with the centre density of the compressed core since co is a very important ingredient for tracing the dense gas in a molecular cloud . from @xmath47",
    "to @xmath48 my , the centre concentration of @xmath46 in the compressed core increased from @xmath49 to @xmath50 and then decreased to 2.2 @xmath51 at @xmath26 my , to 3.08 @xmath52 at @xmath27 my .",
    "the variation of the co fraction reflects the change of the centre density in the cloud structure over the whole evolutionary sequence .",
    "the position of the co core at @xmath26 my is very similar to the observed one as shown in ic59 structure in lower part of the right panel of figure [ co ] @xcite .    in order to investigate the thermal properties of the caps ,",
    "the east cap was chosen for keeping a consistency with the column density estimation in the last section .",
    "figure [ tempcore ] presents a temperature distribution of the east cap within a slice of @xmath53 pc centered at @xmath54 . because of the low initial density of the cloud ( 3.48 @xmath17 ) , ionizing flux easily penetrates into the cloud structure and gas particles in the cap are heated dominantly by ionizing hydrogen atoms . the average temperature over a region of @xmath55 pc , @xmath56 pc is @xmath57 k , which is comparable with the value of 590 k estimated by @xcite , while the average temperature in the core behind the concave rim is only 65 k due to its higher density ( 807 @xmath17 ) than that in the cap structure ( ~ 40 @xmath17 ) .",
    "the dimension of the region with such a temperature distribution is also consistent with that was determined by @xcite for the dimensions of the east cap : a diameter of 0.18 pc and height of 0.12 pc . beyond the front surface of the east cap , the temperature reaches @xmath58 , typical to hii region . around the front surface of the east cap , recombination of electrons with hydrogen ions creates the bright rim as shown in figure [ alpha ] , although dimmer than that around the concave part of the rim , where the ionisation / recombination are most active .      taking the consistent results derived from our simulation for the column density ,",
    "the position of co core , the dimension and mean temperature of the east cap with that from observations , we could confidentlly construct a whole evolutionary pictrue for the formation of the whole structure of ic59 : an initially uniform and spherical molecular cloud evolved into a type m brc after being exposed to the ionizing radiation from the nearby star @xmath2cas for 1.11 my ; the observed cap structure is one of its two caps formed at the above specified time , where there is no condensed cores inside due to its high temperature state ( 520 k ) ; the whole structure will expand away after t = 1.7 my .",
    "centre of the cap therefore no iras point sources should be observed in both of caps structures .",
    "our simulation results strongly support the comment made by @xcite on the the nature of the previously reported iras point source inside the east cap , i.e. , the spuriously detected iras point source inside is merely an unresolved dust feature. from the simulation result , we conclude that there is no prospect for triggered star formation in the whole structure of ic59 at all",
    ". we will address a general criteria in the next subsection for the prospect of rdi triggered star formation in type m brcs .      in order to find the physical conditions for the formation of type m brcs and its relation to the possibility of triggered star formation",
    ", we firstly define the initial position of our simulated molecular cloud in lefloch s two - parameter space , the ionization parameter @xmath59 and recombination parameter @xmath60 which are expressed in the following forms @xcite : @xmath61 where @xmath20 and @xmath62 is the initial densities of ionized and neutral hydrogen atoms respectively ; @xmath63 is the isothermal sound speed in the ionized gas ; @xmath64 is a parameter to describe the effective thickness of the recombination layer around the molecular cloud ; @xmath65 is the effective recombination coefficient under the the assumption of on the spot approximation @xcite ; @xmath66 is the initial radius of the cloud ; @xmath67 and @xmath68 are two functions of the @xmath69 and @xmath62 .",
    "this two dimensional parameter space was divided into five different regions depending on the prospects of the evolution of molecular clouds under the effect of uv radiation . according to lefloch s rdi modeling without inclusion of the self - gravity of the system , the clouds in region i ( @xmath70 ) and ii ( @xmath71 ) are too trivial to discuss because the effect of the ionization is too weak to produce any noticeable dynamical effects ; clouds in region iii ( defined as @xmath72 )",
    "is entirely photo - ionized by an r - weak ionization front and there is no possibility for rdi triggered star formation .",
    "recent investigation based on a sph code developed by the authors of this paper has proved that the lower boundary of region iii should be shifted to @xmath73 as the result of inclusion of the self - gravity of the cloud in the our code @xcite .",
    "classifications of region iv and v are not very relevant to the clouds we are interested in this work , therefore will not be described here .",
    "the cloud we simulated above ( termed as cloud a in the following ) has @xmath74 and @xmath75 , so that its initial location in lefloch s two - parameter space is in region iii ( @xmath73 ) , which means that there should be no prospect for triggered star formation in a cloud of an initial mass of 2 m@xmath76 and a radius of 1.4 pc , while f@xmath77 @xmath9s@xmath11 .",
    "the simulation result presented in the last section on the future evolution of the ic59 is consistent with the predicted prospect of the brcs by the modifiled lefloch s 2-dimensional parameter space model .    in order to show that type m brc is indeed",
    "one of morphologies resulted from uv radiation effect and type m brc formation in cloud a is not by chance , we made further exploration to a few more molecular clouds of different initial physical conditions .",
    "we further found another two molecular clouds ( termed as b , c clouds in the following ) which would develop type m brcs and finally expand and split into pieces as cloud a does .",
    "we listed their initial physical properties in table [ clouds ] with the calculated values of ionization / recombination parameters .",
    "it is clearly seen that their initial physical status make them all locate in region iii . following",
    "the way we did our exploration , we can , in principle , found infinite number of molecular clouds with different physical conditions and under different strength of uv radiations , which would form a type m brc by rdi mode .",
    "although we are not able to prove that all of the molecular clouds located in region iii in lefloch s two - parameter space will form type m brcs , we can at least conclude that an initial location in region iii in the @xmath78 parameter space is a necessary condition for a molecular cloud to develop a type m brc morphology , i.e , a molecular cloud has to be in a very high initial ionization state , as the definition of region iii described .",
    "furthermore it is also true that the triggered star formation by rdi mode is not possibly to occur in all of type m brcs observed , which may form a good guidance for astronomers who are looking for the sign of triggered star formation in different brcs .",
    "based on our latest observation and numeriacl simulation results to the nebula ic59 in sh-158 , we conclude that the observed cap structure ( so called ic59 in sh-158 ) is actually one of the two caps of a type m brc which is a transient morphology from type a morphology to a full expansion , which is developed over the evolution of a molecular cloud of an initial mass of 2 m@xmath76 and a initial radius of 1.4 pc , under the effect of uv radiation from nearby star @xmath2 cas .",
    "the molecular cloud is at a very high initial ionization state in the ionization flash region iii in lefloch s two dimensional parameter space .",
    "comparison of the simulated physical properties of the type m brc with the observations on ic59 structure tells that the observed ic59 has been exposed to the ionizing radiation from @xmath2 cas for about 1.11 my .",
    "simulation result predicts that the observed ic59 structure will continue expanding and finally split into pieces after another 0.59 my .",
    "the future evolution of ic59 revealed by numerical result is consistent with the analytical conclusion on the evolutionary prospect of a molecular cloud located in region iii in the two - parameter space defined by @xcite , i.e. , all of the molecular clouds with their initial status in region iii will be finally evaporated with no prospect for triggered star formation at all .",
    "further investigation found more molecular clouds of different initial conditions could evolved into a type m brc after a type a morphology was developed through rdi mode .",
    "however these molecular clouds share a common character , i.e. , no matter how different their initial masses or radii , their initial conditions make them all locate initially in region iii in lefloch s two parameter space .",
    "therefore we are able to define a necessary condition for a molecular cloud to develop a type m brc based on the analytical results @xcite and our numerical simulations : the molecular cloud should have the initial physical conditions that make it an initial state in region iii in lefloch s two - parameter space .",
    "although the formation of type m brc may not account for all of the obseerved offsets of the apexes of brcs to the radial directions of their illuminating stars , our simulation results reveal that if there are two caps connected by a concave front surface in an observed brc structure and the concave part is centrally aligned with the radial direction of the star , then the offset of the apex of the observed caps structure to the radial direction of the star may be caused by the formation of a type m brc . in a seperated paper , we will address some other reasons which could possibly cause the offset of the apex of a single structure brc to the radial direction of the illuminating star .",
    "more importantly , the presented simulation results in this paper reveal that triggered star formation will not occur in the observed type m brc , neither in its cap structures nor behind the concave front surface .",
    "the above results based on our simulations strongly support the argument made by @xcite on the nature of the structure of ic59 : the previously detected potential example of triggered star formation is spurious and the observed iras source(s ) in ic59 is merely an unresolved dust feature .",
