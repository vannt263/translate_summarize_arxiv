    "the physics of geometrical frustration in strongly correlated electron systems has long attracted much attention @xcite . in particular ,",
    "possible absence of magnetic long - range orders at zero temperature in the heisenberg and hubbard models defined on frustrated lattices , or the realization of a spin liquid phase as an exotic state of matter , has been one of the major issues in this field .",
    "the mott metal - insulator transition is also a fundamental phenomenon in the field of strongly correlated electron systems @xcite , which has attracted much experimental and theoretical interest as well .",
    "as one of the simplest models with geometrical frustration and mott transition , we therefore study the hubbard model at half filling defined on the triangular lattice in this paper , where not only the nearest - neighbor hopping parameters but also the next - nearest - neighbor ones are included .",
    "much effort has so far been devoted in the study of the triangular - lattice hubbard model with _ anisotropic _",
    "nearest - neighbor hopping parameters @xcite , which was motivated by experimental findings of possible spin liquid states in some organic mott insulators such as @xmath3-(et)@xmath4cu@xmath4(cn)@xmath5 @xcite and etme@xmath5sb[pd(dmit)@xmath4]@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the triangular - lattice heisenberg model with the anisotropic exchange interactions has also been studied to find a variety of ordered phases such as nel and spiral orders , as well as the quantum disordered ( or spin liquid ) phases in - between @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the _ isotropic _ triangular - lattice hubbard model with both the nearest - neighbor ( @xmath0 ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath1 ) hopping parameters has not yet been addressed , the study of which will therefore provide useful information on the physics of magnetic frustrations and mott metal - insulator transition in strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "the isotropic heisenberg model with the nearest - neighbor ( @xmath7 ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath8 ) exchange interactions , which may be derived by the second - order perturbation of the above - mentioned hubbard model in the strong correlation limit , has on the other hand been studied much in detail , mostly from the theoretical point of view @xcite . in the classical heisenberg model where the spins are treated as classical vectors ,",
    "it is known that a single phase transition occurs at @xmath9 between the three - sublattice 120@xmath2 nel ordered state and an infinitely degenerate four - sublattice magnetically ordered states @xcite .",
    "this degeneracy is lifted by quantum fluctuations , thereby selecting a two - sublattice stripe ordered state through the so - called `` order - by - disorder '' mechanism @xcite .",
    "one may then expect in the corresponding quantum heisenberg model that an intermediate phase can appear near the classical critical point at @xmath9 , for which many studies have been carried out to predict that the nonmagnetic disordered phase bordered by the 120@xmath2 nel ordered phase at @xmath10 and the stripe ordered phase at @xmath11 actually emerges .",
    "in particular , recent studies actually predict the emergence of either a gapless or gapped spin liquid phase in this intermediate region @xcite .",
    "these results of the heisenberg model may be compared with those of our hubbard model in the strong correlation limit ( as we will see below ) .    in this paper , motivated by the above developments in the field",
    ", we will study the triangular - lattice hubbard model at half filling with the isotropic nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor hopping parameters in its entire interaction strength .",
    "we use the variational cluster approximation ( vca ) , one of the quantum cluster methods based on the self - energy functional theory ( sft ) @xcite , which enables us to take into account the quantum fluctuations of the model with geometrically frustrated spin degrees of freedom .",
    "we thereby calculate the grand potential of the system as a function of the weiss fields for spontaneous symmetry breakings ; here , we take the 120@xmath2 nel and stripe magnetic orders and evaluate the order parameters and critical interaction strengths .",
    "we also calculate the charge gap as well as the density of states ( dos ) and single - particle spectral function using the cluster perturbation theory ( cpt ) @xcite and determine the ground - state phase diagram of the model in its entire parameter region .",
    "we will thereby show that in the strong correlation regime the 120@xmath2 nel and stripe ordered phases appear , and in - between , the nonmagnetic insulating phase caused by the quantum fluctuations in the frustrated spin degrees of freedom emerges , in agreement with the heisenberg model studies .",
    "we will also show that in the intermediate correlation regime the nonmagnetic insulating phase expands to wider parameter regions located around @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which go into a paramagnetic metallic phase in the weak correlation regime via the second - order mott transition .",
    "the characteristic behavior of the critical phase boundary of the mott transition is discussed in terms of the van hove singularity appearing in the calculated dos and single - particle spectral function .",

    "<S> the variational cluster approximation is used to study the isotropic triangular - lattice hubbard model at half filling , taking into account the nearest - neighbor ( @xmath0 ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath1 ) hopping parameters for magnetic frustrations . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the ground - state phase diagram of the model . in the strong correlation regime , </S>",
    "<S> the 120@xmath2 nel and stripe ordered phases appear , and a nonmagnetic insulating phase emerges in between . in the intermediate correlation regime , the nonmagnetic insulating phase expands to a wider parameter region , which goes into a paramagnetic metallic phase in the weak correlation regime . </S>",
    "<S> the critical phase boundary of the mott metal - insulator transition is discussed in terms of the van hove singularity evident in the calculated density of states and single - particle spectral function . </S>"
