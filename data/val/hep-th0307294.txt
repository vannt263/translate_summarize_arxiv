    "black holes radiate particles thermally at the hawking temperature @xcite . as schwarzschild",
    "black holes are losing their mass by the radiation , their hawking temperature is increasing because the temperature is inversely proportional to the mass .",
    "the temperature and the intensity of the radiation increase explosively at the final stage of the evaporation , therefore small black holes are very interesting to particle physicists @xcite .",
    "several authors discussed that heating - up by the hawking radiation can thermalize the neighborhood and thermal phase - transitions around the black holes can arise .",
    "the qcd phase transition @xcite and the electroweak ( ew ) phase transition @xcite have been shown .",
    "the local phase - transition around the black hole makes the spherical domain wall which separates the symmetric - phase - region from the broken - phase background .",
    "several mechanisms of the baryon - number - production by the black holes accompanied with the ew wall have been shown and the cosmological baryogenesis scenario by using one of the mechanisms has been proposed @xcite .    the thermal phase - transition on finite volume requires the local thermal equilibrium which is confirmed by an enough interaction rate in the considered volume .",
    "it is shown that the mean free paths of the radiated particles are much longer than the schwarzschild radius .",
    "hence the scale of the thermalized volume and the radius of the wall should be much larger than the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the formation of the wall by the thermal phase transition needs much higher hawking - temperature than the critical temperature of the transition @xcite .",
    "however , it is natural to ask if the hawking radiation whose temperature is equal to or slightly greater than the critical temperature influences the higgs vacuum - expectation - value ( vev ) locally .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the hawking radiation of such a temperature in the gauge - higgs - yukawa theories , e.g. , the standard model ( sm ) and the grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "we show that a structure of the spherical domain wall around the black holes arises by the field dynamics of the system .",
    "the analysis seems to be difficult because the system is fully non - equilibrium , however , we find that properties of the system quite simplify the analysis .",
    "the mean free paths of the radiated particles with gauge interactions are much longer than the radius of the black hole @xcite .",
    "the mean wavelength of the radiated particles is approximately given by the radius of the black hole and is shorter than the length - scale of the wall - structure which we will consider outside the black hole .",
    "these simplify the analysis .",
    "the hawking - radiated particles can be regarded as ballistic because of their long mean - free - paths and their short wavelengths .",
    "their masses are proportional to the higgs vev @xmath0 .",
    "our basic idea of the wall - formation - mechanism is schematically shown in the figure [ idea.eps ] .",
    "when once a radius - depending higgs - vev - structure @xmath1 , namely the spherical wall - structure , has been formed , the hawking - radiated particles run rush up the slope of the structure and they push the structure outside . concretely",
    "when a particle with momentum @xmath2 ascends a small part of the slope from the position @xmath3 to @xmath4 , the momentum of the particle becomes @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 means the conserved energy of the particle .",
    "the part of the slope receives momentum @xmath8 .",
    "therefore there arises a pressure , named the hawking pressure , which is acting on the structure to expand its radius . on the other hand",
    "the structure also feels its wall - tension and the higgs - potential - force , which are acting on the structure to shrink its radius .",
    "a balance of these pressures seems to be able to keep the structure stationary .",
    "the relevant interaction in this mechanism is only the yukawa interaction between a ballistic particle and the higgs vev .",
    "is the distance from the center of the black hole and @xmath1 is the absolute value of the higgs vev .",
    "when once a wall - structure is formed , mass of the particle is depending on the distance @xmath9 . a part of the momentum @xmath10 of the hawking - radiated particle is transfered to the wall because the momentum is depending on the distance @xmath9 in the wall - structure : @xmath11 .",
    "the transfered momentum causes a hawking - radiation - pressure acting on the wall .",
    "the local balance of the pressures can stabilize the wall - structure .",
    "[ idea.eps ] ]    to realize the idea of the wall - formation systematically we propose _ the ballistic model _ as an effective description of the system .",
    "our model consists from the action for the higgs field and that for the relativistic point particles radiated from the black hole .",
    "we derive the effective potential which determines the configuration of the higgs vev around the black hole . by considering the effective potential , formation of the spherical domain wall around the black hole",
    "is shown when the hawking temperature is equal to or greater than the energy scale of the higgs - yukawa theory .",
    "we will call this mechanism _ the dynamical formation of the spherical wall _ in distinction from the thermal formation . in this paper",
    "the dynamical formation of the ew wall and that of the gut wall are shown as concrete examples .",
    "we also discuss a mechanism of _ the spontaneous charging - up of the black hole _ as an application of the spherical wall .",
    "the hawking radiation is neutral for any charge , however , the following assumptions allow us to consider the charging - up mechanism .",
    "we assume ( i ) a cp - broken phase in the spherical wall and ( ii ) a chiral charge assignment of the fermions in the field theory , i.e. , a c - violation of the theory .",
    "these assumptions induce a reflection - asymmetry for the charge on the wall .",
    "therefore a charge - transport - mechanism from the wall into the black hole works and it charges - up the black hole .",
    "this mechanism is a variant application of the charge - transport - mechanism of the electroweak baryogenesis proposed by cohen , kaplan and nelson @xcite .",
    "the assumptions are equivalent to two of the sakharov s conditions for the baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "when the hawking temperature is on the ew scale , the mechanism strongly works and the hyper - charge is transported into the black hole . the black hole of the gut temperature can also obtain several charge .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ formation.sec ] the formation mechanism of the spherical wall is discussed . in section [ chargeup.sec ] a mechanism for the spontaneous",
    "charging - up of the black hole is discussed . in section [ summary.sec ]",
    "we provide a conclusion and discussions .",
    "we consider a hawking radiation in the gauge - higgs - yukawa theory like the standard model ( sm ) . especially we discuss dynamics of the higgs field around the black hole whose hawking temperature is similarly equal to or greater than the energy scale of the theory , e.g. , the critical temperature .",
    "in the situation the mean free paths of the hawking - radiated particles are much greater than the length scale of the black hole @xcite . because the mean wavelength of the radiated particle is approximately given by the schwarzschild radius , the mean wavelength is similar to or smaller than the length - scale of the domain wall which we will consider around the black hole .",
    "we can regard these radiated particles as ballistic .",
    "the particles are almost freely running away from the black hole except for the interaction with the higgs vacuum - expectation - value ( vev ) as their background .",
    "only the yukawa interactions of the heavy fermions with the higgs vev and the gauge interactions of the heavy gauge bosons with the higgs vev are relevant .",
    "these particles obtain their mass from the higgs vev through the interactions .",
    "inversely we can expect the deformation of the higgs vev , i.e. , the symmetry restoration or the wall formation , by the particles with both high energy and high density around the black hole .",
    "the deformation can be approximately treated by a combination of the relativistic kinematics of each radiated ballistic particle and the dynamics of the higgs field with the relevant interactions .",
    "the approximated system should have lorentz invariance and each ballistic particle should obtain its mass by the higgs vev . to discuss the subject we propose _ the ballistic model _ which satisfies the required conditions .",

    "we expect that the mechanism also works by the cp - asymmetry of the wall derived by the kobayashi - maskawa phase of the sm .",
    "when a black hole of the gut temperature is considered , several charge can be transported into the black hole .",
    "the amount of the charge is depending on the chiral charge assignment @xmath173 of the gut .",
    "in this paper the hawking radiation in the gauge - higgs - yukawa theory is investigated by the effective model based on the ballistic property of the hawking - radiated particles .",
    "the dynamical formation of the spherical domain wall around the black hole is shown .",
    "our model , named the ballistic model , is described by the ordinary higgs action with a double well potential and the action for the many relativistic point particles coupled to the higgs field .",
    "the ballistic model quite simplifies the analysis of the higgs vev structure around the black hole as compared with directly analyzing the field - equations for the gauge - higgs - yukawa theory .",
    "the ballistic model is valid when ( i ) the mean free path of the hawking - radiated particle is greater than the wall radius @xmath81 and ( ii ) the mean wavelength @xmath174 of the particle is smaller than @xmath81 .",
    "the mean wavelength @xmath174 is approximately given by the schwarzschild radius @xmath94 .",
    "the radius of the wall we have concluded in ( [ condition ] ) satisfies @xmath175 , then our analysis is consistent with the second condition . if the background of the black hole is not thermalized , the first condition is always satisfied . when the hawking temperature @xmath69 is so much high that the hawking radiation thermalizes its neighborhood and the plasma - temperature in the neighborhood locally exceeds the critical temperature of the phase transition , the thermal formation of the spherical wall arises @xcite instead of the dynamical formation .",
    "the transition from the dynamical wall to the thermal wall may be interesting subject .",
    "transitional time - evolutions of the vev , like the process of the initial wall - formation , are computed by ( [ higgs - eom-2 ] ) with adding a kinetic term @xmath176 in a sense of the time - depending mean - field .",
    "the time - scale of the wall - formation is estimated to be @xmath177 because both the wall - radius ( [ rdw ] ) and the effective potential ( [ effpot3 ] ) have the same energy scale @xmath141 .",
    "the lifetime of the black hole is @xmath153 .",
    "when we consider a black hole of @xmath178 , the ratio becomes @xmath179 .",
    "the ratio for the gut wall is @xmath180 .",
    "therefore there is enough lifetime of the black hole for the wall - formation when energy - scale of the phase - transition is equal to or lower than the gut scale .",
    "general relativistic ( gr ) effects are omitted in our analysis .",
    "the black hole has been assumed as an particle - source with a thermal spectrum of the hawking temperature .",
    "no reliable treatment for the gr corrections to the hawking - radiated particles has been known .",
    "for example , a blue - shift effect near the horizon arises when we consider that the trajectory of the radiated particles obeys the schwarzschild metric .",
    "the effect implies that the energy of the radiated particles near horizon is much higher than the hawking temperature .",
    "no matter how low the hawking - temperature is , the effect allows us to consider the formation of the spherical wall near the horizon dynamically or thermally .",
    "this effect is interesting , however , has difficulties to treat properly .",
    "the problem of the gr - effect will be the future subject .",
    "we have evaluated the influence from the radiated particles into the higgs vev and have found the formation of the wall . on the other hand , there should arise the backreaction from the wall into the motion of the particles .",
    "the largest backreaction is the reflection of the low - energy particles by the wall . when @xmath181 , the backreaction is ignored because most of the radiated particle pass through the wall . in the case",
    "the form of the wall is insignificantly deformed by the backreaction and the higgs vev in the wall becomes slightly smaller .",
    "when @xmath182 , the backreaction can not be ignored because many of the radiated particles are reflected on the wall .",
    "we will subsequently develop the argument of the backreaction .",
    "one may consider that our solution for the higgs field shown in the figure [ wallform.eps ] is not a domain wall according to the usual terminology  a domain wall is a region of a false vacuum which separates into different real vacua .",
    "however our terminology `` domain wall '' is suitable because of the following reasons .",
    "the local vacuum @xmath84 in ( [ phi_min ] ) is continuously varying ( see the figure [ wallconcept.eps ] ) because the effective potential @xmath183 in ( [ effpot3 ] ) is apparently depending on the position @xmath184 .",
    "the continuous vacuum is roughly divided into two vacua , namely , the symmetry - restored local - vacuum @xmath185 for the neighborhood of the black hole as @xmath186 and the symmetry - broken vacuum @xmath187 for @xmath188 .",
    "our solution separates these vacua .",
    "our solution @xmath90 does not correspond to the continuous vacuum @xmath84 for @xmath189 \\sim \\end{array}}}r_{{\\rm dw}}$ ] ( see the figure [ wallform.eps ] ) , i.e. , the region can be considered as a false vacuum .",
    "consequently the properties of our solution agree with the ordinary definition of the domain wall .",
    "we have also discussed the mechanism of the spontaneous charging up of the black hole by the effect of the spherical domain wall .",
    "the mechanism works when a c - violation of the field theory and a cp - broken phase in the wall are assumed .",
    "our analysis results that the mechanism works when the initial hawking temperature of the black hole is smaller than about @xmath190 .",
    "the black hole of ew size strongly drives the mechanism and the hyper - charge is transported into the black hole by the ew wall .",
    "the black hole of the gut size can obtain several charge by the gut wall .    on the other hand , a mechanism for the spontaneous charge - loss of the black hole has been discussed .",
    "gibbons first proposed this subject by the semi - classical method @xcite and recently gabriel discussed that this result can be confirmed by the functional method @xcite .",
    "their works were briefly as follows .",
    "the strong electric field around the black hole induces the pair creation of the charged particles .",
    "one of the pair - created particles falls into the black hole and the other runs away from the black hole .",
    "the outgoing particles carry away the charges from the black hole .",
    "consequently they concluded that a kind of schwinger process could work for discharging the black hole .",
    "these calculation are reliable when the radius of the black hole is greater than the compton wave length of the electron , i.e. , @xmath191 . because the radius of the black hole discussed in this paper is smaller than the ew length - scale , we can not directly apply their process of the charge - loss to our system .",
    "several authors discussed the subject for the charge loss of the smaller black hole @xmath192 @xcite , however , we do not know a relevant treatment in this case .",
    "there is not only the quantum process of the charge - loss but also the classical mechanism preventing the black hole charging - up .",
    "the radiated particles whose charge is opposite to the black hole are attracted to the black hole . when the electric charge is transported and the charge of the black hole becomes @xmath193 , the particles of charge @xmath194 feel the electrostatic potential as @xmath195 .",
    "if we assume that the black hole is only a particle - source of energy @xmath196 , the charging - up by our mechanism stops when the charge of the black hole becomes @xmath197 because the radiated particle of the opposite charge can not across the potential barrier . in this paper we have used the same assumption , then this charge - bound may be natural .",
    "the subjects of the charge - up and the charge - loss are related to the problem of the remnant ; `` after the completion of the hawking radiation , whether something is left or not ? '' and `` if something is left , what is it ? '' .",
    "one of the candidates for the remnant is the extremal - charged black , which is quantum - mechanically stable .",
    "if the process of the charge - loss does not work , the extremal - charged black hole is left as the remnant because the black hole looses its mass by the hawking radiation and approaches the extremal - charged hole .",
    "zeldovich discussed that a black hole leaves a remnant with a planck mass scale @xcite .",
    "if the charge - loss process works and later the process stops as the charge becomes small , a planck - massive remnant with several ( hyper-)charges is left after the end of the hawking radiation . there arises no singularity in the solution of the dirac equation around a electric point charge @xmath193 if @xmath198 .",
    "the solution with a singularity indicates the fall of the charged particle into the center , then we may expect the stop of the charge - loss",
    ".    such a remnant can be applicable to explain the dark matter of the universe @xcite .",
    "the scenario is as follows .",
    "primordial black holes are created by the density - fluctuation in the very early universe and are later made to dominate over the universe by the universe expansion .",
    "the hawking radiation of the black hole reheats up the universe and the spherical ew wall thermally formed around the black hole provides the baryon number for the universe . the black hole obtains some charge by our charge - up process and becomes the planck - massive remnant as the main constituent of the dark matter .",
    "finally we expect that the formation of the spherical wall around the black hole plays crucial roles in the cosmology .",
