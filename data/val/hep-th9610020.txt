    "one of the most serious issues in light - front field theory ( lfft ) is the complicated renormalization procedure@xcite . if we wish to solve relativistic bound state problems by diagonalizing _",
    "finite _ dimensional hamiltonian matrices numerically , we are forced to make a kind of tamm - dancoff ( td ) truncation@xcite , which restricts the total number of particles in any intermediate states .",
    "although this has been very powerful in two - dimensional field theories such as the massive schwinger model@xcite , it causes a serious problem in the renormalization program in higher dimensions .",
    "it is because loop diagrams contain more particles in the intermediate states and thus may not be included in the high fock sectors in the td approximation . on the other hand ,",
    "the corresponding counterterms are not excluded by the td truncation in a similar way .",
    "this is the source of the so - called `` sector - dependent '' counterterms@xcite .",
    "how is it possible to solve the relativistic bound state problem with a _ finite _ dimensional hamiltonian without hitting the above - mentioned problem ?",
    "a field theoretical hamiltonian is infinite dimensional in two aspects : ( 1 ) in a relativistic field theory , fluctuations of all scales couple each other . a high - energy fluctuation ( or state ) couples to a low - energy one in a similar way as a low - energy one does .",
    "the hamiltonian is therefore infinite in `` energy space . ''",
    "( 2 ) a relativistic field theoretical hamiltonian usually contains interactions which change the particle number of a state .",
    "if we represent the hamiltonian in a fock space , many - body states couple to few - body states .",
    "the hamiltonian is infinite in `` particle number space . '' in order to obtain an effective finite dimensional hamiltonian matrix we have to have the control over the high - energy states and the many - body states .",
    "our hope is to simulate the effects of the many - body , high - energy states on the low - energy , few - body states by a set of effective interactions which do not change particle number so much and do not couple to high - energy states either . in this way",
    ", we might be able to justify the description of a bound state as a weakly bound system of the constituents .",
    "the `` parton picture '' of bound states is most apparent in light - front quantization .",
    "this is precisely the reason why we are interested in lfft .",
    "a renormalization group approach is necessary to control the effects of high - energy and many - body states .",
    "the conventional notion of renormalization is to simulate the effects of high - energy states by a set of local operators , called counterterms .",
    "it is obvious from the discussions in the previous paragraphs that we need to generalize it so that counterterms also simulate the effects of many - body states .",
    "it is useful to distinguish two different renormalizations , though they are closely related in a complicated way .",
    "( 1 ) `` energy renormalization '' controls the effects of high - energy states .",
    "it is almost identical to the conventional one .",
    "the only difference comes from light - front quantization ; in equal - time theory , a high - energy state is a high - momentum states , while on the light front , a high - energy state may have a small momentum .",
    "this implies that the counterterms in lfft are no longer local .",
    "nevertheless we still hope that we may use the covariant perturbation theory in this renormalization .",
    "( 2 ) `` td renormalization''@xcite deals with the effects of many - body states .",
    "probably , the most useful scheme for the td renormalization is the similarity transformation of the hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "a similarity transformation does not change the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian . by appropriately choosing the similarity transformation",
    ", one may make the hamiltonian more diagonal .",
    "the idea is to use similarity transformations to make the hamiltonian more diagonal _ in particle number space_.    there are two advantages in this approach : ( 1 ) we may be able to use the covariant perturbation theory in the first step .",
    "this is important because the covariant perturbation theory is very powerful in revealing the divergence structure .",
    "furthermore , it is much easier to obtain the effects of loops than in the old - fashioned perturbation theory , or , by a perturbative similarity transformation in energy space .",
    "( 2 ) the troubles of td truncations are avoided at least partially .",
    "the effects of the higher fock states are included as the effective ( induced ) interactions generated in the td renormalization .",
    "the similarity renormalization group approach is proposed by gazek and wilson@xcite ( and by wegner@xcite independently ) and discussed by the ohio - state group extensively@xcite .",
    "the similarity renormalization group is designed to avoid small energy denominators in the old - fashioned perturbation theory and to eliminate the interactions which change the _ energies _ of the unperturbed states drastically .",
    "there are two problems in their approach : ( 1 ) it is hard to incorporate with loop diagrams .",
    "the coupling constants do not run in the calculations so far done@xcite .",
    "as far as they do not run , it is easy to obtain the so - called `` coherent '' hamiltonian@xcite . on the other hand , however , if one goes to higher orders and takes into account the running , one would face to the difficulty of getting it .",
    "( 2 ) after the similarity transformation , there are still interactions which change the number of particles . in the calculations",
    "so far done , such interactions are usually ignored . in our two - step approach , we take advantage of the covariant perturbation theory to incorporate with the loop contributions in the first stage , while the interactions which change the number of particles are eliminated systematically .",
    "the td truncation now becomes a part of the approximation , which can be improved systematically .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss a simple example to illustrate the basic idea of the two - step perturbative td renormalization .",
    "the model is a @xmath0-dimensional ( discretized ) field theory which is a kind of hybrid of @xmath0-dimensional equal - time @xmath1 theory and the one quantized on the light front .",
    "this model exhibits the mass , coupling constant , and wave function renormalization at the second - order in perturbation theory .",
    "we first obtain the counterterms in the feynman perturbation theory .",
    "we then diagonalize the hamiltonian in a naive tamm - dancoff approximation .",
    "we see that the lowest energy state is almost independent of the cutoff if the counterterms are included , while the first excited state become more cutoff dependent if the counterterms are included .",
    "this illustrates the necessity of the sector - dependent counterterms in a naive tamm - dancoff approximation .",
    "next we eliminate the interactions which change the number of particles perturbatively by a similarity transformation .",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian is diagonal in particle number space .",
    "we then diagonalize the effective hamiltonian numerically .",
    "the lowest energy state is almost independent of the cutoff .",
    "it is one of our main results to show that the next - to - lowest energy state is also almost independent of the cutoff , despite that we work in a severely truncated space .",
    "let us begin with the definition of the model , which we call `` @xmath2 theory . ''",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath3 where `` momenta '' @xmath4 are integers .",
    "the unperturbed energy @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 may be interpreted as mass .",
    "we assume that the cutoff @xmath8 , a large integer , is much larger than the mass @xmath7 and the coupling constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 are small enough so that the perturbation theory works well .",
    "as we will see , this model is `` trivial '' ( see eq.([lambdarg ] ) ) , we keep the coupling constants and the cutoff small so that we do not approach to the landau singularity .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators are assumed to satisfy the usual commutation relations .",
    "@xmath11=\\delta_{n , m}.      \\label{commutator}\\ ] ]    this model is similar to the usual equal - time @xmath1 theory in @xmath0 dimensions but the interaction terms which contain only annihilation operators or only creation operators are absent .",
    "( this is a typical feature of lfft . )",
    "we regard @xmath9 and @xmath10 as two independent coupling constants . unlike the light - front @xmath1 theory , on the other hand , the `` momentum '' @xmath12 can take negative values .",
    "the unperturbed dispersion relation is also different from the usual ones .",
    "therefore this @xmath2 theory should be regarded as a hybrid model and should be studied on its own right .",
    "the reasons why we consider this model are : ( 1 ) it is extremely simple , and ( 2 ) it exhibits mass , coupling constant , and wave function renormalization already at the second order in perturbation theory .",
    "one can study the effects of renormalization easily in this simple model .",
    "note that the model is invariant under the transformation @xmath13 .",
    "the eigenstates are divided into the `` odd '' sector , which contains odd number of particles and the `` even '' sector , which contains even number of particles .",
    "the fock vacuum is an eigenstate of the full hamiltonian with the eigenvalue zero .",
    "the lowest energy state above the vacuum is the ( physical ) one - particle state , while the first excited state is a ( physical ) two - particle state .",
    "it is easy to develop feynman perturbation theory for the @xmath2 theory , though it has no covariance .",
    "for example , the propagator is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the operator in the interaction picture , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "in the usual way , one can readily obtain the feynman rules .",
    "( see fig.1 . )      in the second - order perturbation theory , the self - energy ( fig.2-a ) for the @xmath2 theory is given by @xmath18 where all the momenta are cutoff at @xmath19 .",
    "one can show that @xmath20      we consider the 2-to-2 ( or @xmath10-type ) interaction and the 1-to-3 ( or @xmath9-type ) interaction separately .    for the @xmath10-type interaction ,",
    "there are two kinds of one - loop diagrams in the second order .",
    "the first one is a _ fish _ diagram ( fig.2-b1 ) , @xmath21 the second one is an _ exchange _ diagram ( fig.2-b2 ) , @xmath22 note that there are four similar exchange diagrams .    for the @xmath9-type interaction ,",
    "there is only one kind of one - loop diagrams in the second order ( fig.2-c ) , @xmath23 there are three similar diagrams .      in order to eliminate the divergent contributions , we add the following counterterms , @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( we are very sloppy in fixing the finite parts of the counterterms ( the renormalization conditions ) . ) note that we do not make any rescaling ( wave function renormalization ) of the operators .",
    "in this section , we discuss a naive tamm - dancoff approximation and the effects of the renormalization considered in the previous section .",
    "we truncate the fock space up to including three particle states . for simplicity , we only consider the states with total momentum zero .",
    "such a state can be expanded as @xmath26}^{\\min\\{2n,\\lambda\\ } }       \\left({1\\over \\sqrt{2}}\\right)^{\\delta_{k,2n } }       \\left({1\\over \\sqrt{2}}\\right)^{\\delta_{n,2k } }       \\varphi_{n , k}a_{n}^{\\dagger}a_{-n+k}^{\\dagger}a_{-k}^{\\dagger }       |0\\rangle ,      \\label{state}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 $ ] stands for the largest integer which is not larger than @xmath28 ( gauss symbol ) .",

    "3-b show the cutoff dependence of the lowest energy states with and without the counterterms .",
    "it is easy to see that the lowest state energy is almost independent of the cutoff if the counterterms are included , while the first excited state energy is almost independent if the counterterms are _ not _ included .",
    "this is because of the td truncation . in this restricted fock space",
    ", one of the particles in the two - particle sector can not get the self - energy contribution , because the intermediate states would contain four particles and are therefore out of the restricted fock space .",
    "if one can include , say , up to ten - particle states , the lowest energy states would not suffer from this disease because in lfft they usually have negligibly small high fock components . in practice , however , such a large fock space is not feasible .",
    "it is therefore necessary to avoid this problem .",
    "it is important to note that the hamiltonian itself has a very simple structure .",
    "it can act on a state with any number of particles .",
    "what it does is to change the particle number by two at most .",
    "the trouble is the restriction on the _ total _ number of particles in a _",
    "state_. it suggests that we should restrict the _ difference _ of the particle numbers in a state between before and after the interaction is applied .",
    "the _ difference _ has no sector dependence , of course .",
    "if we can turn off the interactions which changes the particle number of a state , there is then no sector dependence .",
    "this is the basic idea of the similarity transformation in `` particle space '' which we discuss in the next section .",
    "let us first consider the similarity transformation in particle space in a general setting . consider a hamiltonian @xmath31 of the form , @xmath32 where @xmath33@xcite . the interaction @xmath34 does not change the particle number while @xmath35 does .",
