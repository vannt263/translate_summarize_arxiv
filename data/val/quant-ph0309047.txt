    "quantum entanglement ( qe ) is the central feature of quantum mechanics that distinguishes a quantum system from its classical counterpart .",
    "it is also the corner stone on which many of the novel applications of quantum mechanics -to quantum computation , quantum information theory , quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation - are based .",
    "indeed , it is this promise that has led to a renewal of interest in qe in recent years .",
    "the simplest example of qe is afforded by a bipartite system of two spin half ( or pseudo spin half ) particles , where the hilbert space has the minimal dimension four .",
    "this system is also called a two qubit system ( 2qs ) in the context of quantum computations . for a 2qs ,",
    "there is essentially only one measure of entanglement ; it may be given _",
    "e.g. _ , by the von - neumann entropy @xmath0 , or expressed in terms of the sum of bilinears in the eigen values as given by the quantity @xmath1 , or in terms of det@xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 is the reduced density matrix obtained by taking a marginal trace over one of the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "states with a vanishing entanglement are separable ( in the strong sense ) : they admit a factorisation @xmath4 . on the other hand , fully entangled states have the maximum correlation , and are collectively designated as bell states .",
    "consider now a n - qubit system ( nqs ) , realised as a multipartite system of @xmath5 spin halfs .",
    "nqs upto @xmath6 have been prepared experimentally with photons , for example @xcite .",
    "it is easy to check that for an nqs , @xmath0 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are not equivalent .",
    "further , none of them is exhaustive .",
    "a natural question that arises is how one may identify a complete set of entanglement measures for any nqs .",
    "there have been several proposals @xcite that attempt at answering this question .",
    "one note worthy proposal is from sixia yu _",
    "et al _ @xcite who posit a hierachy of @xmath9 classes of entanglement .",
    "the total number grows exponentially with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "an alternative approach is to look for physically interesting measures , apart from @xmath0 and @xmath7 , with ( potential ) applicability to quantum computation .",
    "this simpler approach would also give direction to the experimentalists to prepare nqs in specified states .",
    "in this context , a useful question to ask is what the entanglement property of a 2qs is , when looked upon as a subsystem of an nqs , when @xmath10 ( there would be no new information when @xmath11 ) .",
    "there would be @xmath12 such subentanglements , as analogues of two particle correlations . in defining the new measure",
    ", we seek to determine the proximity of a given 2qs to the classic bell states mentioned above .",
    "wootters @xcite has developed a closely related concept called concurrence ( hereafter denoted @xmath13 ) for 2qs , which is required to characterise the so called entanglement of formation ( eof ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , eof is defined to be the minimum entropy carried by a mixed state , under all possible resolutions @xmath14 of a reduced density matrix of a 2qs ; the set \\{@xmath15 } does not _ necessarily _ form a basis - much less an orthonormal set .",
    "@xmath13 , which measures this eof is then defined as follows :    the concurrence for a mixed 2qs is given by @xmath16 where the @xmath17 are the eigenvalues , arranged in decreasing order of magnitude , of the operator + @xmath18    the so called eof is itself given by    the entanglement of formation is given by + @xmath19    the above definitions are attractive , and have been used to estimate bipartite entanglement in spin systems @xcite .",
    "there are also reports that states with nonvanishing @xmath13 have been prepared experimentally @xcite .",
    "attempts have been made to generalise the definition to higher spin sectors @xcite .",
    "there is , thus , quite an interest in @xmath13 .",
    "the definition of @xmath13 , rather involved in its form , crucially hinges on the concept of eof .",
    "however , it is well known that there is no way of inferring how a system is prepared @xcite , no matter which property of the density matrix we look at , unless it corresponds to a pure state .",
    "thus the physical interpretation of eof is rather dubious , and does not seem to have any operational significance . indeed",
    ", suppose the expansion of @xmath20 in eq.1 is replaced by a more general decomposition @xmath21 p_{\\{\\alpha_i\\ } } \\vert \\psi(\\{\\alpha_i \\})><\\psi(\\{\\alpha_i\\ } ) \\vert$ ] , where the states are now labelled by a set of continuous parameters @xmath22 with @xmath23 $ ] being an appropriate integration measure .",
    "the parameters could be taken to be the coordinates of the associated compact phase space , for instance .",
    "the probabilities @xmath24 have as much physical significance as the discrete variables @xmath25 in eq.1 .",
    "but the new expansion would change the criterion for eof , leading to a different expression for concurrence .    with this critique of @xmath13 in mind",
    ", we propose an alternative definition of concurrence ( hereafter called @xmath26 ) , with a two fold aim : to attain conceptual and computational simplicity .",
    "@xmath26 is required merely to capture the entanglement of a 2qs which is a subsystem of a larger nqs , in a manner that suggests a generalisation to higher spin sectors .",
    "we take this up in the next section .",
    "as a warm up , and for motivation , consider a 2qs first . let a 2qs be in the state @xmath27 the key step in defining concurrence is in recognising that @xmath28 is a measure of entanglement , equivalent to the standard measures listed above .",
    "@xmath29 is much simpler to evaluate , though .",
    "our notion of concurrence is inspired by , and is very close in its definition to , @xmath29 .",
    "although @xmath29 does _ not _ carry any new information , it does exhibit a symplectic structure which is not apparent in the other two measures .",
    "further , as observed by hill and wootters @xcite , it can also be written in the form @xmath30 , the inner product of @xmath31 with its conjugate ( equivalently , time reversed ) state which we define thus : @xmath32 the main thrust of the paper is that this form of entanglement for a 2qs needs _ little _ modification in defining concurrence in nqs , @xmath10 .",
    "the definition will be given in steps , so as not to have a cluttered notation .        which is obtained by a partial conjugation  on the sector ( 12 ) .",
    "the definition of concurrences @xmath36 and @xmath37 follow similarly . by definition @xmath38 take values in the range",
    "@xmath39 $ ] .",
    "@xmath40 also has an in built symplectic structure ; to see this , consider the quadruplet of vectors @xmath41 the expansion is in the ordered basis @xmath42 .",
    "the concurrence is now simply written as @xmath43 which naturally generalises the definition of entanglement in a 2qs in a manner appropriate to our purpose @xcite .",
    "@xmath44 is the transpose of @xmath45 .",
    "one can straight away construct quadruplets for @xmath46 by inspection .",
    "it is also straight forward to generalise the definition when the parent state is an nqs in a pure state .",
    "we write the expression for the @xmath47 sector :      the computational simplicity of @xmath26 is evident , from its very form , if only we demonstrate its viability .",
    "a convenient method is to use @xmath13 as a benchmark to test the new definition against .",
    "for , the definition of @xmath13 is also motivated by the entanglement measure @xmath29 .",
    "figure 1 . gives a comparison of the two definitions , where the states are generated randomly .",
    "one sees an overall agreement so long as @xmath13 remains positve , without having to impose the minimality condition by hand . in those regions where @xmath13 has to be declared as vanishing ( when @xmath51 ) in _ definition 1 _ , @xmath26 differs from @xmath13 : indeed",
    ", these states are distinguishable , in the sense that each of them has a preferential proximity to one of the bell states which is more clear in fig.2 .",
    "the computational advantage is of course evident from the form of @xmath26 . for ,",
    "if we start with a nqs , there are @xmath12 such concurrences . even in regions where @xmath13 has no interpretational problem , _ definition 1 _ requires an evaluation of three reduced density matrices , a determination of their partner states , and an evaluation of the eigenvalues of @xmath52 .",
    "the necessity of these computations gets obviated in the determination of @xmath26 .",
    "we proceed to enlarge the definition of concurrence to higher spin sectors .",
    "note that there is no analogue of @xmath13 here , since the criterion for eof which was evolved in @xcite is specific to a 2qs .",
    "the generalisation in our case is naturally suggested by the form for @xmath26 written above .",
    "indeed , let @xmath53 be the state in which an nqs is .",
    "we define the conjugate state @xmath54      the above definition is unfortunately restrictive ; it works only when the subsystem of the nqs is bosonic ; the fermionic states ( @xmath55 odd ) are always orthogonal to their conjugates .",
    "apart from this , there is generality with respect to the choice of the @xmath55 qubits since any @xmath55 qubits may be chosen to be in the order given , by a permutation .",
    "the number of independent concurrence measures is given by @xmath57 .",
    "figure 3 displays the 4q concurrences for states generated from a 6qs . as an illustration , and as an example of the discerning capability of the higher order concurrences which we have defined here ,",
    "the shor code will be compared with the steane code , both of which are used in quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "the shor code @xmath58 is a nine qubit state , written as a direct product of three 3q states each of which have the form @xmath59 , in writing which we have employed the qubit notation : @xmath60 . this entangled state has vanishing concurrences in _ all _ orders .",
    "in contrast , the steane code , constructed with seven qubits has a more involved structure ; it is not seperable the way the shor state is . , and is given by @xmath61 . as a manifestation , although all the 2q concurrences vanish , the 4q concurrences survive in the sectors @xmath62 , and all of them attain the maximum allowed value 1 .",
    "the 6q concurrences vanish .",
    "these features highlight quantitatively the manner in which the two codes differ from each other . at this point",
    ", it is good to remember that a complete separability in the strong sense , where the multiqubit state is a direct product of single qubit states , necessarily implies a vanishing concurrence of all orders .",
    "the converse is not necessarily true , as exemplified by the state generating the shor code .",
    "finally , the question of handling mixed states still remain .",
    "not getting into the general case , only the 2q concurrence will be discussed .",
    "the general case only involves rewriting the argument with more indices .",
    "indeed , given a 2qs in a mixed state @xmath20 , the method is to look upon @xmath20 as having descended from a pure parent state of a higher dimension @xmath5 .",
    "significantly , @xmath63 .",
    "the determination of parent state is done by simple inspection .",
    "it also follows that if @xmath20 has only real components , then @xmath64 it is not difficult to check that although the parent state is not unique , the concurrence determined will be so - reflecting the fact that it is a property of the system , and not of the parent - introduced purely as an intermediate step .",
    "this final remark completes the programme undertaken .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have redefined in this note the concept of concurrence which has a much simpler form , and is computationally trivial - compared to @xmath13 and its generalisations thereof .",
    "it is not based on the notion of eof .",
    "while concurrences do not completely characterise a system - which was not our aim - it appears that they do constitute an important subset of entangled states , especially in the two qubit sector .",
    "the higher order concurrences also have a significance , as illustrated by the concurrence properties of shor and the steane codes .",
    "the true import of entanglements of this kind would manifest with only a more geometric approach , which will be taken up in a subsequent publication .",
