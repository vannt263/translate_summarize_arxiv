    "particle accelerators are technological devices which allow studies at both infinitely small scale , e.g.  particles responsible for elementary forces , and extremely large scale , e.g.  the origin of cosmos . in a simplified approach ,",
    "such devices are composed of basic elements sequence : focusing and defocusing magnets , accelerating electromagnetic fields and trajectory bending elements as they are used in the case of ring accelerators .",
    "the resulting dynamics is nonlinear , and can be described , in the absence of strong damping , by a conservative system",
    ". this system can be modelled by a symplectic map built from the composition of several elementary maps corresponding to each basic magnetic element .",
    "one of the main problems found in the dynamics of ring accelerators is to study the stability around the nominal orbit , i.e.  the circular orbit passing through the centre of the ring .",
    "each component of the ring can be seen as a nonlinear map , that deforms the trajectory at large amplitude .",
    "moreover , such maps possess stochastic layers whose effect is the reduction of the stability domains around the nominal circular orbit ( the so - called _ dynamical aperture _ - da ) @xcite .",
    "such behaviors imply that ( chaotic ) nearby orbits can drift away after a few ring turns , eventually colliding with accelerator s boundaries , and consequently reduce the beam lifetime and the performance of the accelerator .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to derive a reliable improvement of the stability of the beam by increasing the da in a simplified accelerator model , consisting of only one type of element having a sextupole nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "we work in the framework of the _ hamiltonian control theory _ presented in  @xcite , where two methods to control symplectic maps have been described , namely using lie transformations and generating functions . in the present paper",
    "we use the former method , that allows direct determination of the new controlled map ; avoiding the possible problems related to coordinate inversion .",
    "the aim of control theory is to improve selected features of a given system , by slightly modifying its hamiltonian with the addition of a _ small _ control term , so that the new system and the unperturbed one are conjugated namely , they have the same dynamics .",
    "this technique is particularly suitable whenever one can directly act on the system and modify it , e.g.  in the case of a particle accelerator where the addition of a control term in the hamiltonian function can be seen as the introduction of a suitable magnet in the accelerator lattice .    in our study , we use the smaller alignement index ( sali )  @xcite method , which is an efficient indicator for characterising orbits as chaotic or regular in hamiltonian flows and symplectic maps .",
    "the sali is computed using the time evolution of two deviation vectors along the studied orbit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we introduce the model in section  [ sec : themodel ] and present a general result for the control of symplectic maps in section  [ sec : ctrlth ] .",
    "we apply the theory to the symplectic map model of a standard ring accelerator in section  [ sec : fodoctrl ] .",
    "we briefly recall the sali chaos indicator in section  [ sec : salimeth ] , while section  [ sec : results ] presents our numerical results on the behavior of the constructed model .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : ccl ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "further technical details can be found in the appendix .",
    "let us consider a system consisting of a charged particle and a simplified accelerator ring with linear frequencies ( tunes ) @xmath1 , @xmath2 , with a localized thin sextupole magnet ( for more details the interested reader is referred to  @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic field of this element modifies the orbit once the particle passes through it .",
    "the basic model is : @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) denote the deflection from the ideal circular orbit in the horizontal ( vertical ) direction before the particle enters the element and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are the associated momentum .",
    "primed variables denote positions and momenta after the particle left the element .",
    "the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are related to the accelerator s tunes   and @xmath10 , corresponding to a non - resonant condition ( see  @xcite ) . ]",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 by the relations @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the first matrix in ( [ eq:4dfodo ] ) describes the linear motion of a particle , which corresponds to a simple rotation in the phase space .",
    "the nonlinearity induced by the thin sextupole magnet is modeled by the 2@xmath13 order polynomial expression in ( [ eq:4dfodo ] ) .",
    "the particle dynamics at the @xmath14-th turn , can be described by the sequence @xmath15 , where the @xmath16-th positions and momenta are defined as a function of the @xmath14-th ones by  .",
    "the map ( [ eq:4dfodo ] ) decomposes in an integrable part and a quadratic perturbation , respectively the system is associated to the following hamiltonian ( see  [ sec : appendix ] ) @xmath17 more precisely ( [ eq:4dfodo ] ) can be written in terms of poisson brackets  . ] as @xmath18 here @xmath19 , with @xmath20 denoting the transpose of a matrix , and by definition , for any function @xmath21 defined in the phase space , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , being the symplectic constant matrix , @xmath24    maps of the form   have already been studied in  @xcite where it has been shown that chaotic orbits reduce the da to a hypersphere of radius @xmath25 in the 4-dimensional phase space ( see figs .  5 and 6 of  @xcite ) .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to show that the stability region of the nominal circular orbit can be increased once the map   controlled by an appropriately designed map .",
    "the aim of hamiltonian theory is to provide mathematic tools to be able to modify the dynamics of a symplectic system . with this , it is possible to manipulate intrinsic features , e.g.  to reduce the chaotic regions in phase space or to build invariant tori .    in the following",
    "we will be interested in controlling a quasi - integrable symplectic map in such a way that it will allow us to obtain a new , _ controlled _ map closer to the integrable part    of the original map , and thus increase the stability region around the nominal circular orbit .",
    "this is of great importance since chaos diffusion channels in phase space with unpredictable consequences in configuration space .",
    "the controlled map is expected to have a smaller number of escaping orbits and a larger region occupied by invariant curves in a neighbourhood of the origin . for this purpose , we apply the method presented in  @xcite , with the modification that in the present case the integrable part is not expressed in action - angle variables . in particular , the integrable part is a rotation , so the present theory applies to perturbations of rotations , instead of maps close to identity .",
    "let us consider an integrable symplectic map defined through its infinitesimal generator   @xmath26 @xmath27 and consider the quasi - integrable map perturbation of the former @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a perturbation , namely @xmath31 .",
    "the aim of hamiltonian control theory , is to construct a third map , the _ control map _ , whose generator @xmath32 is small ( it satisfies @xmath33 ) . the _ controlled map _",
    "@xmath34 will be conjugated to a map @xmath35 , closer to @xmath36 than @xmath37 ( see   below ) .",
    "we note that the use of the exponential of a poisson bracket , ensures that such maps are symplectic by construction .    to be more precise , let us define the unperturbed map @xmath38 and observe that @xmath39 is not invertible , since its kernel contains any smooth function of @xmath26 .",
    "thus we assume the existence of a pseudo - inverseoperator , @xmath40 , that should satisfy ( see  @xcite for details ) @xmath41    at this point we can define the _ non - resonant _ and the _ resonant _ operators @xmath42 which are projectors , i.e. @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "our main theoretical result can be stated in the following theorem :    [ thm : control ] under the above hypotheses and defining @xmath45 we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 with a control term given by @xmath48    [ rem : warpplus ]",
    "let us define as in  @xcite the warped addition , @xmath49 , of two operators by @xmath50 an explicit formula can be obtained using the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula  @xcite , where @xmath49 is a series whose first terms are @xmath51 hence the warped addition is a deformation of the usual addition between operators .    using this warped addition ,",
    "we can rewrite the controlled map into the form @xmath52 where the control term   becomes @xmath53    from   we have : @xmath54 one can easily prove ( see appendix a of  @xcite ) that @xmath55 hence , recalling the definition of @xmath56 and  , we can rewrite   as @xmath57 by rearranging the terms we can easily get @xmath58 which is nothing but   rewritten using the warped addition .    [ rem : smallness ] let us observe that the control term is , as required , small compared to @xmath30 .",
    "in fact from   and by using the approximated formula for the warped addition  , we obtain @xmath59 where we use the relation @xmath60 .    under the assumption of absence of resonances ,",
    "i.e. @xmath61 , the @xmath62 term in the control map can be explicitly computed to give ( see  [ sec : appendix ] ) @xmath63",
    "in this section we derive the controlled map presented in section [ sec : ctrlth ] in case of maps of the form ( [ eq:4dfodo ] ) . to implement the theory we need to diagonalize the operator @xmath64 .",
    "for this reason we introduce complex variables @xmath65 and rewrite @xmath26 as @xmath66    the poisson bracket with @xmath26 now takes the form @xmath67 hence , for any @xmath68 and @xmath69 we obtain @xmath70 here we introduced the vector @xmath71 and use the compact notation @xmath72 for the complex vector @xmath73 .",
    "the operator @xmath64 is diagonal in these variables and thus map   is straightforwardly obtained as @xmath74    once we have this map , we can compute the operators @xmath40 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . for all @xmath77 and @xmath78 , such that @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( which defines the _ non - resonance condition _ )",
    ", we get @xmath81 with @xmath82    in the rest of the paper , we will assume the above non - resonant condition   to hold for the considered values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "let us remark that this is not a limitation of the actual theory , but just a working assumption .",
    "we could equivalently have chosen to work in the resonant regime , using a different control term suitable for resonant dynamics .",
    "the explicit computations are as follows : first we need to express @xmath30 in terms of complex variables ; next we compute @xmath45 , and transform back to the original variables .",
    "finally we compute the exponential @xmath83 .",
    "actually , even if @xmath84 is a polynomial of degree three in the variables @xmath85 the map @xmath83 is given by an infinite series .",
    "the terms of this series can be sequentially computed , but the degree of complexity ( i.e.  the number of involved terms ) increase very fast . to simplify the computations we decided to use the _ approximated _ generator of the control map already truncated at order 2 @xmath86 we note that @xmath87 is composed by about twenty terms . a detailed discussion of the whole procedure needed to obtain @xmath87 , as well as its explicit formula , are presented in  [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "we now face another difficulty , namely the computation of the control map from the generator @xmath87 .",
    "this is equivalent to perform the sum @xmath88 whose complexity once again grows very fast .",
    "we thus introduce a second approximation to our construction , by computing only a finite number of terms in the above sum .",
    "so , we define a _ truncated control map of order _",
    "@xmath89 @xmath90 and a _ truncated controlled map of order _",
    "@xmath89 @xmath91    since the exact control map @xmath92 given by     is symplectic , the controlled map   will also be symplectic .",
    "on the other hand , we can not expect the @xmath89-th order control map @xmath93 to be symplectic .",
    "we know that a map is symplectic if its jacobian matrix @xmath94 verifies ( in its definition domain ) the equality @xmath95 thus , in order to check the _ symplecticity defect _ of @xmath96 we compute the norm @xmath97 of matrix @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the jacobian of @xmath96 given by  .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ jac ] for orders @xmath100 up to @xmath101 , in the region @xmath102\\times[-1,1]$ ] , @xmath103 .",
    "the results indicate that @xmath96 is a good approximation of a symplectic map for @xmath104 , because we get @xmath105 for a large portion ( @xmath106 % ) of variables values .",
    "we note that in the central region of the truncated controlled map , where the actual physical process of beam s evolution occurs , the symplectic character of the map is established even better since there @xmath107 .",
    "as expected , the larger the order @xmath89 , the closer to symplecticity the approximation is .",
    "the main objective of the addition of a control term is to increase the size of the stability region around the central periodic orbit .",
    "this increase leads to decrease the number of escaping orbits is defined as non  escaping if for all @xmath108 for a certain @xmath109 ( in the simulations we used @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) and escaping otherwise ] , as we can see from the results presented in fig .",
    "[ compare ] , where we plot in black the initial conditions on the square @xmath112\\times[-1,1]$ ] , @xmath103 , giving rise to orbits that do not escape up to @xmath113 iterations of the map . in particular , we consider in fig .",
    "[ compare](a ) the original uncontrolled map  , and in figs .  [ compare](b ) to  [ compare](d ) , the @xmath89 order controlled map @xmath96 for @xmath100 to @xmath101 respectively .",
    "one can easily see that the region of non - escaping orbits for the original map is smaller than the one of the controlled maps .",
    "this observation can be quantified by considering initial conditions inside a circle centered at the origin of each panel of fig .",

    "results reported in fig .",
    "[ controlcompare ] support the previous claim , by clearly showing that controlled maps of orders @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 behave very similarly and lead to an increase of the non - escaping region .",
    "let us note that the behavior of the controlled maps of orders @xmath100 ( fig .  [ compare](b ) ) and @xmath119 ( fig .  [ compare](c ) ) is somewhat misleading if it is not analyzed together with the information from the symplecticity defect ( see figs .",
    "[ jac](a ) and ( b ) respectively ) .",
    "in fact , these maps are strongly dissipative and produce a strong shift of orbits towards the origin , preventing them from escaping .",
    "this dissipation effect is not physical , as it is not observed in real accelerators , and therefore we do not discuss further the @xmath100 and @xmath119 controlled maps .     as a function of the distance from the origin in the physical space @xmath120_. we iterate initial conditions in a circle of radius @xmath121 centred at the origin of plane @xmath120 , with @xmath122 , and",
    "compute the percentages of non - escaping orbits during @xmath123 iterations , for the controlled map @xmath96 with @xmath124 , as a function of @xmath121 .",
    ", height=264 ]    from the results of figs .",
    "[ compare ] and  [ controlcompare ] we see that the addition of even the lower order ( @xmath125 ) control term , having an acceptable symplecticity defect , increases drastically the size of the region of non - escaping orbits around the central periodic orbit",
    ". a further increase of the order of the control term results to less significant increment of this region , while the computational effort for constructing the controlled map increases considerably .",
    "in fact , @xmath126 contains around @xmath127 elementary terms , i.e.  monomials in @xmath128 , while this number is almost doubled for each order , so that @xmath129 contains around @xmath130 terms . also the cpu time needed to evolve the orbits increases with the order .",
    "for example , while the integration of one orbit using @xmath126 takes about @xmath131 times the cpu time needed to integrate the original map ( [ eq:4dfodo ] ) , the use of @xmath129 needs almost @xmath132 times more .",
    "thus we conclude that the @xmath133 controlled map , which can be considered quite accurately to be symplectic , is sufficient to get significant increment of the percentage of non - escaping orbits , without paying an extreme computational cost .",
    "the smaller alignment index ( sali )  @xcite has been proved to be an efficiently simple method to determine the regular or chaotic nature of orbits in conservative dynamical systems . thanks to its properties , it has already been successfully distinguished between regular and chaotic motion both , in symplectic maps and hamiltonian flows @xcite .    for the sake of completeness ,",
    "let us briefly recall the definition of the sali and its behavior for regular and chaotic orbits , restricting our attention to @xmath134-dimensional symplectic maps .",
    "the interested reader can consult  @xcite for a more detailed description . to compute the sali of a given orbit of such maps , one has to follow the time evolution of the orbit itself and also of two linearly independent unitary deviation vectors @xmath135 .",
    "the evolution of an orbit of a map @xmath37 is described by the discrete - time equations of the map @xmath136 where @xmath137 , represents the orbit s coordinates at the @xmath14-th iteration .",
    "the deviation vectors @xmath138 at time @xmath14 are given by the tangent map @xmath139 where @xmath94 denotes the jacobian matrix of map  , evaluated at the points of the orbit under study .",
    "then , according to  @xcite the sali for the given orbit is defined as @xmath140 where @xmath141 denotes the usual euclidean norm and @xmath142 , @xmath143 are unitary normalised vectors .    in the case of chaotic orbits ,",
    "the deviation vectors @xmath144 , @xmath145 eventually become aligned in the direction defined by the maximal lyapunov characteristic exponent ( lce ) , and sali@xmath146 falls exponentially to zero . an analytical study of sali s behavior for chaotic orbits",
    "was carried out in  @xcite where it was shown that @xmath147 with @xmath148 , @xmath149 being the two largest lces .    on the other hand , in the case of regular motion the orbit lies on a torus and the vectors @xmath144 , @xmath145 eventually fall on its tangent space , following a @xmath150 time evolution , having in general different directions .",
    "this behavior is due to the fact that for regular orbits , the norm of a deviation vector increases linearly in time .",
    "thus , the normalization procedure brings about a decrease of the magnitude of the coordinates perpendicular to the torus , at a rate proportional to @xmath150 , and so @xmath144 , @xmath145 eventually fall on the tangent space of the torus . in this case",
    ", the sali oscillates about non - zero values ( for more details see  @xcite ) .",
    "the simplicity of sali s definition , its completely different behavior for regular and chaotic orbits and its rapid convergence to zero in the case of chaotic motion are the main advantages that make sali an ideal chaos detection tool .",
    "recently a generalization of the sali , the so - called generalized alignment index ( gali ) has been introduced  @xcite , which uses information of more than two deviation vectors from the reference orbit .",
    "since the advantages of gali over sali become relevant in the case of multi - dimensional systems , in the present paper we apply the sali method for the dynamical study of the 4d map ( [ eq:4dfodo ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the goal of constructing the controlled map @xmath151 is to increase the percentage of regular orbits up to a given ( large ) number of iterations , or equivalently increase the size of the stability region around the nominal circular trajectory ( i.e.  the da ) . because the presence of chaotic regions can induce a large drift in the phase space , that eventually could lead to the escape of orbits , the achievement of a larger da can be qualitatively inspected by checking via the sali method the regular or chaotic nature of orbits in a neighborhood of the origin ( see fig .  [ fig5c ] ) .",
    "we note that we define an orbit to be chaotic whenever sali@xmath152 , and regular for the contrary .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5c ] ( which should be compared with fig.5 of @xcite ) we observe a strong enlargement of the region of regular orbits .",
    "this region is characterized by large sali values . in particular , for @xmath153 iterations of the @xmath133 map , @xmath154 of the considered orbits are regular , while for the uncontrolled map this percentage reduces to @xmath155 .",
    "this improvement can be also confirmed by visual inspection of fig .",
    "[ compare ] , where the regions of non - escaping orbits are shown for different orders of the controlled map ( [ eq : ctrlledmapordk ] ) .    in figs .",
    "[ fig5c](a ) and ( b ) we see that there exist orbits of the @xmath156 map , which are characterized as regular up to @xmath157 iterations , while they show their chaotic character once they are iterated up to @xmath158 .",
    "such orbits correspond to the dark regions marked by a black circle in fig .",
    "[ fig5c](b ) ( for comparison this circle is also plotted in all panels of fig .",
    "[ fig5c ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy is absent for the @xmath133 map , which shows almost the same geometrical shape for the non - escaping region when we pass from @xmath153 to @xmath113 iterations . in order to better understand this behavior we followed the evolution of a single orbit with initial condition @xmath159 inside the black circle in fig .",

    "we also observe that increasing the total number of iterations from @xmath153 to @xmath113 ( dashed and solid lines in fig .",
    "[ sphere ] respectively ) increases the percentage of chaotic orbits , but the radius of the 4d sphere containing only regular orbits does not change significantly .",
    "in this paper we considered a simple model of a ring particle accelerator with sextupole nonlinearity that can be described by a symplectic map . in the framework of hamiltonian control theory",
    ", we were able to control the dynamics of the original system , by providing a suitable control map , resulting in a small perturbationof the initial map .",
    "this control map has been constructed with the aim of da enlargement of the particle accelerator , and thus improving the beam s life - time and the accelerator s performance .",

    "we find that the @xmath163 order controlled map @xmath133 is an optimal choice for the controlled system .    using this controlled map we succeeded in achieving our initially set goal , since the @xmath133 map exhibits a da with a radius more than @xmath0 times larger than the one for the original map ( see fig .  [ sphere ] ) .",
