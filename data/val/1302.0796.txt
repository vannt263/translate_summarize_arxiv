    "the interpretation of dark matter search data depends critically on a complete understanding of detector response to nuclear recoils .",
    "these are expected to be induced via elastic scattering of dark matter particles off target nuclei @xcite .",
    "the modest recoil energies anticipated from weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) interactions complicates this necessary labor of detector characterization . in recent times , a number of potential signals have been reported by several such searches .",
    "these anomalies @xcite , together with claims of exclusion of the relevant wimp phase space by other experiments @xcite , have underlined the importance of proper detector characterization prior to the reporting of positive or negative results .    nuclear recoils ( nr ) induce a diminished response in target materials , when compared to electron recoils ( er ) of the same energy . in scintillators",
    ", this is mainly due to the small fraction of the recoil energy ( @xmath0 ) that is transferred to electron excitation : an energy - dependent quenching factor ( @xmath1 ) can be defined as the ratio of the light yield from a nuclear recoil to that from an electron recoil of the same energy .",
    "nuclear recoil energies ( typically expressed in units of kevnr ) therefore correlate to a smaller observable electron equivalent energy ( kevee ) through this quenching factor .",
    "the energy scale is typically calibrated using monochromatic gamma rays , leading to a satisfactory knowledge of the electron recoil response . however , in order to predict the response to wimp - induced nuclear recoils , a dedicated characterization of the quenching factor is necessary .",
    "this is typically accomplished using neutron - induced nuclear recoils .",
    "quenching factor measurements can be divided into two groups .",
    "the first involves use of sources generating a broad spectrum of neutron energies , such as ambe or @xmath2cf .",
    "a comparison between the simulated and observed response to the source is used to generate a best - fitting quenching factor , often approximated as being energy - independent @xcite . if an attempt is made to include the dependence on energy , uncertainties in the simulation and systematic effects in the measurement are forced into the derived @xmath3 .",
    "this is specially grave at the smallest energies investigated ( few kevnr ) @xcite . a second more reliable method , yet",
    "not entirely devoid of its own issues @xcite , involves monochromatic neutron sources .",
    "the detection of the scattered neutron at a fixed angle from the incoming neutron beam leads to a precise knowledge of the recoil energy deposited in the target material under test @xcite .    in the particular case of nai[tl ] scintillators like those used by the dama / libra collaboration @xcite , the first method has been reported to yield a sodium recoil quenching factor @xmath4 averaged over 6.5 to 97 kevnr @xcite . for iodine recoils this was @xmath5 over the range 22 to 330 kevnr @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the values found were @xmath6 and @xmath7 , averaged over 5 - 100 kevnr and 40 - 300 kevnr , respectively .",
    "the second method yields values in principle compatible with these .",
    "however , in the most recent measurement of this second type @xcite , a trend towards an increasing @xmath8 with decreasing recoil energy is observed down to the lowest measured energy , @xmath910 kevnr .",
    "this increase is also predicted by a semi - empirical treatment of the scintillation mechanisms at play @xcite .",
    "indeed , the kinematic threshold @xcite below which this @xmath8 would be expected to decrease should appear at a considerably smaller @xmath102.5 kevnr for sodium recoils in nai[tl ] @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this possibility , other scintillators such as liquid xenon ( lxe ) are expected to display a decreasing quenching factor starting already below kinematic thresholds at few tens of kevnr @xcite .",
    "the channeling of recoiling ions within a crystal lattice constitutes an additional source of uncertainty specific to single crystal scintillators such as nai[tl ] .",
    "if this process is present at the few kevnr energies of interest , it can result into a considerable displacement of the region of wimp parameter space ( mass , coupling ) able to explain dama / libra observations , away from values already severely constrained by other experiments @xcite .",
    "a recent theoretical reanalysis of this possibility @xcite concluded that while ion channeling is a process well - established at higher energies , it should play a negligible role for dark matter searches .    the new measurement of @xmath8 and @xmath11 in nai[tl ] presented here attempts to address the uncertainties described above with the introduction of several improvements , delineated in the next section .",
    "these include the use of a scintillator with a ( partly ) known crystallographic orientation .",
    "this allowed a first experimental test of the possibility of channeling at few kevnr .",
    "an increasing @xmath8 towards low @xmath0 and/or non - negligible ion channeling would result in a common region of interest in wimp phase space for the dama , cogent and cresst anomalies @xcite . as discussed below , neither of these effects was observed .",
    "based on present results , the energy - independent values @xmath12 , @xmath13 that are typically adopted in the interpretation of the dama / libra annual modulation should be held suspect .",
    "the last section in this paper briefly discusses the impact of these findings on the interpretation of dama / libra results , and their compatibility with other searches .",

    "these measures can be listed :     measurement of @xmath14 using a c - s spectrometer ( see text ) .",

    "multiple measurements were made to monitor the absence of deuterated target depletion during neutron scattering runs .",

    "the reader is referred to the discussion around fig .  4 in @xcite for a detailed explanation on how an insufficient light yield can result into artificially large values of @xmath1 at the lowest recoil energies measured .",
    "taking as a reference the @xmath2010 kevnr at which the present measurement starts to suffer from such threshold effects , and scaling by the presently achieved increase in light yield , it is possible to conclude that all previous measurements of @xmath21 below @xmath2040 kevnr have been disturbed to some extent by the artifact described in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , only the lowest @xmath98 kevnr data point in this work is expected to be somewhat affected .",
    "the small dimensions of the nai[tl ] crystal presently used ( 17@xmath2217@xmath23 mm ) were sanctioned via mcnp - polimi monte carlo simulation @xcite to ensure that multiple - scattering played a negligible role , comprising just @xmath1010.5% of total neutron interactions .",

    "this action , on its own , results into overestimating @xmath21 in the region of energy next to dama / libra s threshold ( @xmath102 kevee ) by approximately 15% ( the precise electron recoil energy scale in dama / libra can be stablished through a convenient line at 3.2 kevee due to @xmath24k contamination ) . in this work",
    "the response to electron recoils is measured throughout the range 2 - 50 kevee via compton scattering .",
    "emphasis is placed on minimizing alterations of the experimental setup and analysis protocol between electron scattering and neutron scattering measurements .",
    "the quenching factor measured here folds in the effect of any non - linearities by taking the ratio between light yields for nr and er of the same energy , at all energies studied .",
    "unfortunately , this optimal approach to extracting @xmath25 is not widely used : the extent to which a large non - linear response to low - energy electron recoils in lxe @xcite might affect the interpretation of dark matter experiments using that target is an open question .",
    "most monochromatic neutron sources exhibit some energy dependence on the emission angle , measured from the direction of the projectile incident on the target sustaining the reaction . in the case of a d - d `` neutron gun '' ( deuterium onto a deuterated target ) like the thermo mp320 generator employed here , this is known to be @xmath262.8 mev in the forward direction , @xmath262.4 mev at 90@xmath27 , and @xmath262.2 mev at 180@xmath27 , for an accelerating potential of 80 kv @xcite .",

    "a value of @xmath72 for putative wimp recoils leading to energy depositions near the 2 kevee dama / libra threshold displaces the region of interest ( roi ) for a wimp interpretation well into the realm excluded by several other techniques , significantly increasing the existing tension . while deviations from the assumption of a maxwellian velocity distribution for the local galactic halo can still reconcile this displaced dama / libra roi with cresst and cogent anomalies @xcite , this is made more difficult by present results .",
    "it can be argued that these halo velocity deviations are to be expected @xcite : the upcoming availability of an improved catalog of nearby stellar velocities from the gaia satellite probe should be able to remove these uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the effect of ion channeling would have been to displace the dama / libra roi towards smaller values of wimp mass and lower couplings @xcite , i.e. , precisely towards agreement with other anomalies , and away from constraints from other techniques .",
    "the objections raised in @xcite and the present absence of any indication for this process leave little room for this possibility ( notice however the possible caveat listed above ) .    in view of the state of affairs , our emphasis should be on continuing to improve the quality of these critical low - energy calibrations @xcite .",
    "efforts @xcite to interpret the microscopic physics underlaying existing ( but questionable ) calibrations may be premature .",
    "if the trend towards vanishing quenching factors at few kevnr continues , scintillating materials may prove to be of limited to no use in searches for low - mass ( @xmath73 gev / c@xmath71 ) wimps .",
