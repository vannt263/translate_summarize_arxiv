    "as the wireless cellular networks evolve towards the 5 g generation , it is expected that the number of base stations ( bss ) per area will noticeably increase  @xcite , leading to _",
    "network densification_. the availability of multiple proximate and interconnected bss leads to the usage of cooperative transmission / reception techniques , commonly referred to as _ coordinated multi - point ( comp )",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these recent trends , a transmission scheme for serving bidirectional traffic simultaneously via spatially separated hd - bss was investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the scheme emulates full duplex ( fd ) operation using two interconnected hd - bss , and is termed _ compflex _ : comp for in - band wireless full - duplex . in the initial work , the performance was analyzed through a simplified one - dimensional wyner - type deployment model .",
    "compflex can be seen as a generalization of fd , where a fd bs corresponds to compflex with interconnection distance zero .",
    "we show that the nonzero separation distance in compflex brings two benefits : ( i ) the distance between a bs and its associated mobile stations ( mss ) decreases ; and ( ii ) the distance between two interfering mss increases .",
    "this translates into improved transmission success probability in uplink ( ul ) and downlink ( dl ) .",
    "the use of in - band fd wireless transceivers  @xcite has recently received significant attention . however , due to the high transceiver complexity , fd is currently only feasible at the network infrastructure side  @xcite and the mss keep the hd transceiver mode .",
    "an in - band fd bs can serve one ul and one dl mss simultaneously , on the same frequency .",
    "other approaches to fd emulation by hd devices have been studied in the literature , such as having the transmissions in ul and dl ( partially ) overlap in time .",
    "that is , the ul and dl time slots , which conventionally should take place at separate time intervals , are now overlapping , an approach used by the rapid on - off division duplexing ( rodd ) in  @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite consider the physical ul and dl channels themselves , and have them overlap .",
    "compared to these approaches , compflex takes advantage of the spatial dimensions in a cellular network .    in this paper",
    ", we treat compflex in a two - dimensional scenario , with planar deployment of interconnected hd - bss . following the trend in the literature for modeling spatial randomness of network nodes ,",
    "we analyze the performance using the tools of stochastic geometry .",
    "stochastic geometry has been used in many papers in the literature to model the placement of network nodes , including fd capable ones as in  @xcite .",
    "the setup of compflex is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compflexsystemmodel ] , where one hd - bs working in the ul cooperates via a wired connection ( double solid line ) with another hd - bs that operates in the dl .",
    "the solid arrows indicate signals ; the dashed arrows interference .",
    "two interfering cells are also shown , and the boundaries between them are indicated by dotted lines . using the interconnection link ,",
    "the interference from the dl - bs to the ul - bs is perfectly canceled .",

    "we assume additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with power @xmath9 .",
    "full channel state information is assumed at all nodes .",
    "the default transmission power of a bs and ms is @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the bss are deployed according to a poisson point process ( ppp ) @xmath12 with intensity @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14th bs located at @xmath15 , defines a _ voronoi region _",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the euclidean distance .",
    "this region consists of those points @xmath19 in @xmath20 that are closer to the bs at @xmath21 than any other bs . from this definition ,",
    "the intersection of any two voronoi regions @xmath16 and @xmath22 is empty , when @xmath23 .",
    "this concept will be important when we consider the ms association in subsec .",
    "[ sub : userassociationandscheduling ] .",
    "we assume that the voronoi tessellation determines the rule by which the ms associates with the bs , both for dl and ul , and further that , at a specific time , only one ms randomly located in a voronoi cell is active .",
    "as stated previously , in compflex we assume that all nodes are hd .",
    "we define a _ compflex pair _ as two adjacent and connected hd - bss , one serving ul and the other dl traffic .",
    "the algorithm for pairing the bss works as follows :    given a deployment @xmath12 , we consider a finite observation window with dimensions @xmath24 km ( i.e. of size @xmath25 km@xmath26 ) , and choose a bs at random in this window .",
    "we then list all the _ unpaired _ neighbors of this bs , and choose one of those randomly .",
    "these two bss are then considered to be a compflex pair .",
    "the algorithm then proceeds to the other unpaired bss , and pairs the adjacent ones that are unpaired .",
    "the bs closest to the origin is called the _ typical _ bs .",
    "[ fig : compflexsnapshot ] shows one instance of the algorithm , where the compflex pairs are indicated by bold lines between the corresponding bss ( shown as triangles in the figure ) . in each compflex pair",

    "given a ms @xmath0 , the bs serving that ms is denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "the algorithm terminates when it is no longer possible to pair any bss . by the rule of pairing , in any compflex pair the two bss must have adjacent voronoi regions .",
    "therefore , any bs whose voronoi region is surrounded by voronoi regions that belong to paired bss remains unpaired .",
    "we assign the unpaired bss either as ul or dl at random , with probability @xmath27 for each .    after the bs pairing , all bss",
    "have been assigned either ul or dl . since bss",

    "we have @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the density of the compflex ul - bss , and @xmath31 the density of the compflex dl - bss .",

    "we approximate the point processes of ul - bss and dl - bss as independent thinned ppps .",
    "this is only an approximation , as from the algorithm it follows that the selection of dl / ul is not independent , since a dl - bs must be adjacent to a ul - bs .",
    "given the voronoi regions defined by the bs deployment , the ms in a given region is scheduled to be served by the bs corresponding to that region . by the definition of a voronoi region , a ms is associated to one unique bs .",
    "more specifically , for every voronoi region @xmath16 one ms is attached to this bs .",
    "the position of the ms is chosen uniformly at random in the region .",
    "the traffic direction of the ms is matched to the corresponding bs , i.e. if the bs is ul , then the ms has ul traffic , similarly for dl .    a snapshot of the deployment and pairing of bss , along with the associated ul and dl mss , is shown in fig .

    "we see that for both compflex and fd , the ul and dl distance curves overlap .",
    "this implies that the distances of ul and dl follow the same distribution .",
    "what is also interesting is that the cdfs of the distances in compflex are shifted to the _ left _ , compared to fd .",

    "second , the cdf curve of the intra - cell interference distance in compflex is shifted to the _ right _ compared to fd .",
    "this means that higher interference distances have higher probability in compflex compared to fd .",
    "taken together , these two points can explain the performance advantages of compflex over fd , which come from having a lower signal distance and a higher interference distance _",
    "in this work , we have analyzed the performance of compflex in a planar network setting , and compared it with a fd baseline scheme .",
    "we have derived the success probability for ul and dl , and validated the results via simulations .",
    "it was observed that the success probability of both ul and dl was higher for compflex than in fd , an effect which can be attributed to the effects of compflex on the node distances .",
    "thus it is beneficial to consider the usage of hd devices instead of fd , which is also useful for using already existing technology and avoiding the signal complexities of fd .",
    "one promising research direction is to consider more than two connected bss , and more general clustering criteria .",
