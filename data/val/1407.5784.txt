    "diffuse , ionized gas is one component of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , where ions and free electrons recombine and produce spectral lines we call recombination lines .",
    "when these transitions occur at low quantum numbers , the recombination lines appear in the optical and uv regime .",
    "recombination lines occur in the radio regime when the quantum numbers involved in the transitions are above @xmath4 , due to the decreased energy spacing of adjacent levels .",
    "models of radio recombination lines ( rrls ) therefore have to predict accurate line intensities for quantum levels above @xmath5 .    in our own galaxy ,",
    "rrls are used to study two phases of the ism .",
    "the classical  rrls are associated with @xmath6 regions , and are usually observed at frequencies above 1.4 ghz ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "diffuse carbon rrls with bound levels as high as @xmath13 have been observed in the direction of cassiopeia a @xcite .",
    "high quantum number rrls manifest at low frequencies , and provide an important method to study physical properties such as electron temperature and density in the cold neutral medium . with recently completed low - frequency ( @xmath14 mhz , @xmath15 ) radio telescopes , such as the low frequency array ( lofar ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we will be able to study these high quantum level transitions . with its unprecedented sensitivity , frequency resolution and coverage and multibeaming capability enabling efficient surveys of the sky",
    ", lofar will revolutionise the field of low frequency rrl studies as a crucial method for studying an important phase of the interstellar medium that so far has eluded detailed studies .",
    "not only will we be able to map a large fraction of the galaxy , but extragalactic sources of rrls will be accessible , providing a redshift - independent means of studying the cold , diffuse gas content of galaxies .    the ability to calculate accurate bound - bound spontaneous transition rates in recombining ions has a wide range of applications , from predictions and measurements in the laboratory to extracting information from observations of a variety of astronomical phenomena .",
    "the transition rates depend on the atomic oscillator strengths , which are used to calculate the spontaneous and stimulated transition rates for non - relativistic electrons .",
    "the oscillator strength is easily described in terms either of the gaunt factor or line strength . for low quantum number states , analytical formulae for oscillator strengths",
    "are easy to compute . however , direct calculation of higher @xmath16 transitions is impossible due to round - off errors and limitations on standard machine representation of numbers .",
    "predicting line intensities requires determining the lte level populations of excited states , or levels , in an atom .",
    "there is a quantum level beyond which the electron will no longer be bound to the atom , and theoretical models must include all quantum levels up to this cut - off level in order to ensure correct calculations of the lte level populations . for the low temperature , low density phase of the ism from which we expect carbon rrls to originate , we have found a cut - off level of @xmath2 is sufficient to ensure this condition and therefore provide accurate line intensities ( salgado et .",

    "we revisit the calculation of the bound - bound gaunt factor for quantum levels up to @xmath2 , using arbitrary - precision operations to compute and tabulate exact values of the gaunt factor for easy use . in this paper",

    "conclusions are given in section 6 , and a link to the downloadable data can be found in the supporting information section .",
    "the gaunt factor is used to calculate spontaneous and stimulated transition rates of electrons between quantum levels .",
    "the spontaneous transition rates , @xmath17 , can be expressed directly in terms of oscillator strength , @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the statistical weight of level @xmath16 ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the charge and mass of an electron , @xmath24 is the frequency of the transition between level @xmath16 and @xmath21 , @xmath25 is the speed of light , @xmath26 is the reduced mass , and @xmath27 is the oscillator strength , which can be expressed in terms of the gaunt factor , @xmath28 .",
    "the factor @xmath29 is calculated from the statistical weight and quantum numbers , giving a total oscillator strength of : @xmath30 this can be substituted into equation  [ einsa ] , expressing the transition rate in terms directly dependent on the gaunt factor . alternatively , total oscillator strength can be expressed in terms of radial dipole matrix elements , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the hydrogenic wave function , and @xmath33 is the electron position vector .",
    "equation  [ einsa ] still holds , but now the oscillator strength is defined : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the line strength , dependent on the radial dipole matrix elements .    the gaunt factor for bound - bound transitions between discrete quantum levels @xmath16 and @xmath21 have the following form @xcite , and are the same whether the transition is in absorption or emission , i.e. @xmath36 : @xmath37^{2n+2n ' } nn'\\delta(n , n')}{n - n ' } \\right\\rvert .\\ ] ] the factor @xmath38 is defined as : @xmath39 ^ 2 \\\\ & - \\left[f(-n'+1,-n,1,-\\frac{4nn'}{(n - n')^2}\\right]^2 \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the hypergeometric function : @xmath41 expanding the series into terms provides : @xmath42 the series will terminate , i.e. have a finite number of terms , if either @xmath43 or @xmath44 is zero or a negative integer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the magnitude of each term in the series is greater than that of the previous term , with alternating signs .",
    "arithmetic operations involving very large or very small numbers on computers can result in round - off errors , and the error increases with the number of operations ( for a more detailed discussion see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . when calculating the value of equation  [ delta ] , the round - off errors ( loss in accuracy ) quickly start to add up , and once the standard floating - point limit of a machine is reached , fail to provide real , non - infinite values .",
    "this has been remarked upon by various authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xcite point out that the exact value of @xmath16 for which these calculations start to break down depends on the variety of algorithms and methods used .",
    "the round - off errors and limitations of the standard floating - point machine representation of numbers have driven other methods of calculation for oscillator strengths .",
    "we outline three prevalent methods in this section , and provide a summary of their accuracy and range of quantum numbers for which they are valid in table  [ tab : methods ] .",

    "this expansion is valid when the difference between the levels is large @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 this formula is easy to compute , and allows for approximations of the gaunt factor for quantum levels that are not calculable from equation  [ gaunt ] using standard machine precision .",
    "these approximations have errors of @xmath47 per cent ( table 1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that the error in the @xcite expansion can be reduced by an order of magnitude by keeping eight terms instead of five in the expansion .",
    "they additionally provide their own asymptotic expansion that has errors not in excess of @xmath48 per cent .      another way to calculate",
    "oscillator strength is via stable recursion relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this method , the line strength @xmath35 in equation  [ snn ] is equated to the radial dipole matrix elements : @xmath49 the calculation of @xmath50 , the radial dipole matrix elements , also contains the hypergeometric function .",
    "however , the matrix elements between subsequent states can be linked through recursion relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . given a starting point , higher quantum number states can be calculated through these relations . the total @xmath51 transition rate comes from summing over @xmath52 levels .",

    "* ) to perform these calculations .",
    "@xcite also provide a fortran code that makes use of recursion relations , to calculate values up to @xmath55 .",
    "both programs were not optimized to handle calculations above these ranges , and are therefore not sufficient for use in our theoretical models of low frequency rrls , which require calculations up to @xmath2 .    a robust method developed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also dewangan 2012 ) exploits recursion relations in jacobi polynomials .",
    "standard mathematical texts transform the hypergeometric function to jacobi polynomials , which have well known properties , including recursion relations and asymptotic expansions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the recursion relations make it possible to directly calculate the jacobi polynomials necessary , as @xcite demonstrated for a sampling of levels up to @xmath13 using extended ( quadruple ) precision .",
    "the author also discusses the usefulness of the asymptotic expression of the jacobi polynomial to examine the behaviour at large @xmath16 , which provides results in good agreement with the analytical values for a large range of parameters .",
    "this method is discussed in far more detail in @xcite , and the interested reader is referred there for further details .",
    "the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) atomic spectra database @xcite is widely used by the scientific community .",
    "this database contains , among other information , values for spontaneous transition rates that are the product of extensive calculations of the opacity project @xcite .",
    "the opacity team extended the close - coupling method , in which wavefunctions are expanded in terms of the product of functions describing the @xmath56-electron states and functions describing the @xmath57 electron .",
    "the entire electron system is divided into an inner and an outer region , with boundary conditions set between the two regions .",
    "an iterative process finds solutions for the outer region , and matching the boundary conditions to the inner region then provides an eigenvalue problem which can be solved to find the bound energy states . in the newest update to the nist database @xcite ,",
    "the team used sophisticated multi - configuration hartree - fock calculations that include relativistic effects to account for both fine and hyperfine structure .",
    "these values were checked against the few available experimental results , and the discrepancies between the theoretical and experimental values are less than about @xmath58 per cent @xcite . for a more in depth discussion of this method",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite , and references therein .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      + @xmath59 no error is reported , as transformations to equate the hypergeometric function to polynomials of other forms are used , and assumed to be exact .",
    "although the gaunt factor ( equation  [ gaunt ] ) is of order unity , it is composed of factors that can be extremely large or small .",
    "for example , for the @xmath2 to @xmath60 transition , the value of the hypergeometric functions is of the order @xmath61 , while the multiplicative factor in front of it is of the order @xmath62 , yielding a value close to 1 . to calculate values as large as @xmath63 , it is necessary to increase the precision of the calculation .",
    "mathematica @xcite allows the user to specify the required precision of the final calculation , and uses a $ maxextraprecision variable to control the precision of intermediate calculations .",
    "we requested a final precision of 10 digits , and the default value of 50 for $ maxextraprecision .",
    "mathematica will keep track of the resulting precision at each intermediate step , and if the precision becomes worse than the desired precision for the final answer , $ maxextraprecision will return an error . calculating the bound - bound gaunt factor for transitions up to",
    "@xmath2 took approximately 5 hours in mathematica using one 2.53ghz core with 4 gb of available ram .",
    "we only performed the calculations for @xmath64 , since the value for the inverse transition is the same .",
    "the precision in these calculations is set by the lack of relativistic corrections , and is therefore of the order @xmath65 .",
    "our values therefore have a precision of @xmath66 per cent .",

    "[ factors ] .",
    "the top left panel shows the analytical values calculated with finite - precision .",
    "starting around @xmath4 , standard finite - precision can no longer represent the values of the hypergeometric series terms in the gaunt factor , and therefore most of the plot is empty . a zoom - in of the first 300 quantum levels",
    "is shown to further clarify the behaviour on the boundary of the region where values can still be represented by standard finite - precision calculations .",
    "the location of this boundary is set by the amount of bits available for double - precision calculations on a machine , and to a smaller extent the algorithms and methods used . when round - off errors start to be large , the gaunt factor values near the boundary fluctuate .",
    "the top right panel demonstrates that gaunt factor values calculated using the asymptotic expansion are at least able to fill the entire parameter space , giving real values near unity for all @xmath67 transitions .",
    "the bottom left panel shows the analytical values for the gaunt factor calculated using arbitrary - precision .",
    "the plot looks remarkably similar to that of the asymptotic expansion , so we plot the difference between the arbitrary - precision and asymptotic expansion values in fig .",
    "[ facdiff ] .",
    "the difference between the arbitrary - precision and asymptotic expansion values is almost always less than the accuracy in the arbitrary - precision values , but it is precisely in the region of interest , @xmath68 ( adjacent levels ) , that the difference is largest .",
    "the maximum difference is @xmath69 , which means the asymptotic expansion is up to @xmath70 per cent too large or small compared to the analytical values .      to compare with methods that calculate line strength rather than the gaunt factor",

    "the comparison is made using spontaneous transition rates for hydrogen , with a reduced mass of @xmath71 .",
    "the nist values include relativistic corrections and are therefore more complete and precise than other methods , so we compare the relative difference between the various methods and the nist transition rates , @xmath72 .",
    "we are only able to make a comparison for those levels available in nist , and this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "the values from @xcite are the closest to the nist values for these low levels , with larger scatter towards smaller changes in @xmath16 .",
    "although the relative difference is larger than that of @xcite , the arbitrary - precision calculations presented here only have a relative difference of only @xmath73 from the nist values .",
    "therefore the arbitrary - precision values will introduce less than a tenth of per cent error into any final calculations we use them in .",
    "the scatter in the relative difference of the arbitrary - precision values of this work when compared to nist values is of the order @xmath74 , indicating that our results are also stable ( i.e. differences in values of @xmath51 have only a very small effect on the relative difference from nist values ) and predictable .",
    "the asymptotic expansions by @xcite and @xcite are also fairly stable , with relative differences of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "we have presented arbitrary - precision calculations of the gaunt factor for transitions up to quantum level @xmath2 , and shown that the improvement in accuracy is always at least an order of magnitude greater than the asymptotic expansions , when compared to the more complete simulations of nist .",
    "the results of the calculations are stable and are at most only 0.03 per cent different from calculations that include relativistic corrections .",
    "the results are available for download as a fits table .",
