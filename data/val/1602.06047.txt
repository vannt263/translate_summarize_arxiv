    "many quantum information protocols involve nonclassical states to achieve their quantum advantages .",
    "for instance , quantum high precision measurements achieve sensitivities beyond the standard quantum limit by utilising nonclassical states .",
    "the standard quantum limit is given by a coherent state , which satisfies the minimum uncertainty relation where quantum fluctuations are equally shared by any two quadrature amplitudes .",
    "one way to break this limit is to squeeze a coherent state  @xcite . a squeezed state exhibits quantum fluctuations below the standard quantum limit in one quadrature at the sacrifice of larger quantum fluctuations in the other , which is directly applicable to achieve high precision measurements .",
    "to apply squeezed states to high precision measurements , it is important that squeezing can be achieved relatively easily . fortunately , squeezing can be achieved via quadratic hamiltonian , and hence it does not require higher - order optical nonlinearity such as kerr effect  @xcite . both squeezing and the quantum advantages by squeezing in the high precision measurements have been demonstrated in experiments  @xcite .    the idea of squeezing has been extended to spin systems  @xcite .",

    "an ensemble of spin-@xmath6 systems can be treated as an su(@xmath3 ) system in a high dimension dependent on the number of spins in the ensemble .",
    "the coherent states of the su(@xmath3 ) system can be defined as the orbit of the su(@xmath3 ) group action on a reference state  @xcite . usually , we take the lowest weight state as the reference state , analogous to the vacuum state in the optical coherent states .",
    "squeezing can then be introduced on the coherent state of the collective su(@xmath3 ) system .",

    "@xcite , the hilbert space of a spin-@xmath7 particle can be spanned by three orthnormal states , and we can consider eight independent observables on the hilbert space .",
    "they correspond to eight generators of the su(@xmath8 ) algebra , and hence the collective system inherits the su(@xmath8 ) structure .",
    "the dimensionality of the su(@xmath8 ) collective system can be determined by the number of the spin-@xmath7 particles .",

    "this extension is relevant to current experiments of squeezing on spin ensembles ; for instance , squeezing in a spin-@xmath9 atomic gas  @xcite and in spin-1 bose - einstein condensates have been observed  @xcite . in view of current and near future experimental developments , it is important to characterize the rich structure of squeezing in the collective su(@xmath0 ) systems and to systematically classify them based on unitary equivalent classes .    among the collective su(@xmath0 )",

    "though it is compact , as the dimensionality of the bloch sphere is the same as that of the phase space based on the optical coherent states , there are similarities between the su(@xmath3 ) squeezed states and the optical squeezed states . when we extend the former to an ensemble of spin-@xmath1 systems ( @xmath2 ) , the structure of squeezing is no longer so simple . as the collective su(@xmath0 )",

    "then , squeezing can be classified into two classes with the different squeezing limits .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize the classification to collective su(@xmath0 ) systems , where the squeezing can be characterized by @xmath10 linearly independent observables . following the classification in ref .",
    "@xcite , we classify squeezing based on the unitary equivalence classes , whose definition is given in sec .",
