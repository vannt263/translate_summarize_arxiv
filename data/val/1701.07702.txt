    "the first time expansion of universe discovered in type ia supernova ( sne ia ) by riess et al @xcite , and then perlmutter et al @xcite redemonstrated this issue by @xmath1 supernovae . also accelerated expansion of universe reconfirmed by cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite .",
    "thus , the result of these literature confirms the existence of a mysterious energy called dark energy .",
    "one of the biggest challenges of modern theoretical physics is understanding the nature of dark energy .",
    "in fact , dark energy is a hypothetical form of energy in space , and constitutes three  quarters of the total energy of the universe .",
    "dark energy requires strong negative pressure to explain the observed accelerated expansion of the universe . by using the einstein field equation ,",
    "the accelerated expansion is described by a small positive cosmological constant .",
    "also , the discovery illustrates that geometry of the universe is very close to flat space - time @xcite . in order to describe dark energy model ,",
    "numerous studies have been performed in isotropic space - time such as scalar fields @xcite , modified gravity models @xcite , holographic models @xcite , interacting models @xcite , bouncing model @xcite and braneworld models @xcite .",
    "now we intend to describe dark energy model with modified gravity theory .",
    "this issue studied in numerous literatures by topics of @xmath2 gravity @xcite , @xmath3 gravity @xcite , @xmath4 gravity @xcite , @xmath5 gravity @xcite , @xmath6 gravity @xcite and @xmath7 gravity @xcite , in which @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are ricci scalar curvature , torsion scalar , trace of the matter energy - momentum tensor and the gauss - bonnet term , respectively .",
    "we note that cosmological solutions of these models can provide an alternative explanation for the accelerated expansion of universe .",
    "in general relativity , the einstein - hilbert action includes the curvature term that describes gravity , but in teleparallel gravity , the corresponding action includes torsion term that first proposed by einstein @xcite .",
    "he has been able to introduce the mathematical structure of distant parallelism by a tetrad or vierbein field for unification of electromagnetism and gravity .",
    "this issue is caused to replace the levi - civita connection in the framework of general relativity with the weitzenbck connection in teleparallelism @xcite .",
    "this means that the @xmath8 in the general relativity changes to @xmath9 in teleparallelism .",
    "its modified form has been done by changing @xmath9 to @xmath12 with an arbitrary function in the teleparallelism action so - called @xmath3 gravity theory .    a model recently proposed by subject of @xmath13 gravity , that one has some benefits in comparison with other models of modified gravity theory @xcite .",
    "one of its benefits is much simpler calculations of numerical solutions , and also is compatible with recent observational data to describe accelerated expansion of the universe . since the @xmath13 gravity can be a good candidate for a source of dark energy , then one is a good alternative for the standard gravity model .",
    "hence these are a good motivation for the present job .",
    "one of the other interesting models for the description of dark energy is chaplygin gas , so one is introduced as a fluid with negative pressure .",
    "chaplygin gas model extended to generalized chaplygin gas and modified chaplygin gas , in which the modified chaplygin gas model is the combination of barotropic model and chaplygin gas model .",
    "the advantage of the modified chaplygin gas model is consistent with observational data , and also unify dark matter and dark energy @xcite .",
    "now , we would like to construct a new model based on interacting @xmath13 gravity with the modified chaplygin gas .",
    "the corresponding model may be a development of several previous jobs that also corresponds with observational data .",
    "this paper is organized as the following :    in sec . [ s2 ] , we review the general form of @xmath13 gravity in the frw metric . in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] , we consider the interaction between @xmath0 gravity model and the modified chaplygin gas , and also obtain the friedmann equations and equation of state ( eos ) . in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] , we investigate the stability of our model by phase plane analysis . finally , in sec .",
    "[ s5 ] we will give result and conclusion for our model .",
    "we start with a novel theory of modified gravity in which there is an arbitrary function of torsion scalar @xmath9 and trace of the matter energy - momentum tensor @xmath10 . in that case",
    ", we can write the corresponding action by @xmath14 d^4x,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the matter lagrangian density .",
    "it should be mention that vierbein field @xmath17 to be related with metric tensor by relationship @xmath18 in which @xmath19 .    in this paper , universe",
    "is considered as the homogenous and isotropic in the frw metric in the following form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is scale factor .",
    "the vierbein field can be written in accordance with metric as @xmath22 .",
    "we note that the levi - civita connection is as @xmath23    ricci tensor @xmath24 , asymmetry tensor @xmath25 and torsion tensor @xmath26 are written as follows , respectively @xmath27 where @xmath28    by varying the action with respect to vierbein field , we can obtain the field equation as follows : @xmath29\\left ( 1+{{f}_{t } } \\right)+\\frac{1}{4}\\delta _ { \\mu } ^{\\nu } \\,t \\\\    = { { s}_{\\mu } } ^{\\nu \\rho } { { f}_{tt}}\\,{{\\delta } _ { \\rho } } \\mathcal{t } + { { f}_{\\mathcal{t } } } \\left ( \\frac{\\theta _ { \\mu } ^{\\nu } + \\delta _ { \\mu } ^{\\nu } p}{2 } \\right)-\\frac{1}{4}\\delta _ { \\mu } ^{\\nu } \\,f(\\mathcal{t } ) + \\frac{{{k}^{2}}}{2}\\theta _ { \\mu } ^{\\nu } , \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where indices denote the derivative with respect to the corresponding parameters , and symbol @xmath30 is the energy- momentum tensor of the matter .",
    "tension scalar and trace of energy - momentum tensor are obtained as the follows :    [ ttheta ] @xmath31    where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the hubble parameter , matter energy density and matter pressure , respectively .",
    "a recent cosmological model has been designed using a kind of perfect fluid ( chaplygin gas ) , that the universe is assumed to be filled with . in this paper ,",
    "the modified chaplygin gas model was used and its mode equation can be expressed as follows : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are positive constant , energy density and pressure of modified chaplygin gas , respectively and also we have @xmath39 . in here we consider the universe dominates by components of matter , dark energy and chaplygin gas . in that case , the effective energy density and the effective pressure of universe are written in terms of the aforesaid three components as    [ rhoeffpeff ] @xmath40    where indices @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are components of cold mater , dark energy and modified chaplygin gas , respectively .    as we know , universe consists a perfect fluid ,",
    "then the corresponding continuity equation can be written in the following form @xmath44    since there is an energy flow between contents of universe , thus we separately write the continuity equations of components of universe as    [ conti2 ] @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are interaction terms between the universe components .",
    "let us consider that there is an energy flow only between the components of dark energy and modified chaplygin gas , in this way @xmath48 .",
    "also , the amount of this interaction terms is considered as @xmath49 in which @xmath50 is the coupling parameter or transfer strength . in this case , the solutions of eqs . and are as follows : @xmath51 @xmath52}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha + 1}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath53    in this paper , in order to solve the friedmann equations and to avoid its complexity , we consider a simple particular model of @xmath0 gravity as a linear function of @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the form @xmath54 . therefore , friedmann equation is deduced as    [ fri3 ] @xmath55    now , the above equations can be written in friedmann standard as follows .",
    "[ fri4 ] @xmath56    from eqs . and",
    ", we can find the density energy and pressure of dark energy in the following form    [ rhopde ] @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the eos of matter .",
    "also , we define effective eos of a perfect fluid , and eos of dark energy as @xmath59 @xmath60    therefore , friedmann obtained equations are written based on the redshift parameter ( @xmath61 ) , in that case , the eqs . and",
    "are rewritten by redshift parameter as    [ rhopde1 ] @xmath62}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha + 1}}},\\label{rhopde1 - 1}\\\\ &    \\begin{aligned }    & { { p}_{de}}=\\frac{\\gamma } { 2}\\left ( 1 - 3{{\\omega } _ { m } } \\right){{\\rho } _ { { { m}_{0}}}}{{\\left ( \\frac{{{a}_{0}}}{1+z } \\right)}^{-3(1+{{\\omega } _ { m}})}}- a{{\\left [ \\frac{b}{\\eta } + { { c}_{0}}\\,{{\\left ( \\frac{{{a}_{0}}}{1+z } \\right)}^{-3\\eta ( \\alpha + 1 ) } } \\right]}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha + 1}}}\\\\ &    + \\frac{b}{{{\\left [ \\frac{b}{\\eta } + { { c}_{0}}\\,{{\\left ( \\frac{{{a}_{0}}}{1+z } \\right)}^{-3\\eta ( \\alpha + 1 ) } } \\right]}^{\\frac{\\alpha } { \\alpha + 1}}}}.\\label{rhopde1 - 2 }    \\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by substituting eqs . into the eq . , and plotting @xmath63 versus @xmath64 . in that case , we see the @xmath63 at the present time @xmath65 equals to @xmath66 , which one indicates universe expanding at an accelerating rate , and also the issue corresponds to work @xcite .    by drawing figures of energy density @xmath67 and pressure @xmath68 of dark energy with respect to redshift ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , we can see that the variations of @xmath67 versus @xmath64 is positive , and the variations of @xmath68 versus @xmath64 is negative , so that these issues confirm the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "in this section , we intend to investigate the stability conditions of the @xmath0 gravity with modified chaplygin gas by the method of phase plane analysis . in that case , we introduce the following new variables as @xmath69 by making derivative the parameters @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 with respect to @xmath73 , and by using the continuity equations , we can obtain them in the following form    [ xyprime ] @xmath74    where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath73 .",
    "we can find term @xmath75 by eq .",
    "as @xmath76    substituting into , the below relationships are deduced    [ xyprime1 ] @xmath77    we note that the first friedmann equation is rewritten by aforesaid new variables as @xmath78    now we describe the stability conditions of the model to obtain the critical points that so - called fixed points .",
    "the corresponding fixed points have the asymptotical behavior , and they are dependent on the @xmath13 model and modified chaplygin gas parameters . in that case , we can obtain the fixed points in terms of the corresponding parameters by setting @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and these results are demonstrated in table [ table1 ] .",
    "as we can see , two fixed points are obtained by names @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the significance of the fixed point is to study the stability of theory and phase transition .",
    ".the fixed points ( critical points ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table3 ]",
    "in this paper , we studied the @xmath0 model by frw background , in which @xmath9 and @xmath10 were considered as torsion scalar and trace of the matter energy - momentum tensor , respectively .",
    "then , we interacted the model with modified chaplygin gas , this means that the effective energy density and the effective pressure of universe were written in terms of three components of matter , chaplygin gas and dark energy .",
    "since universe considered as a perfect fluid , hence the effective continuity equation was separated by three continuity equations of universe components . in that case , we supposed to exist only an energy flow between the components of dark energy and modified chaplygin gas by interaction term as @xmath83 . in what follows , the arbitrary function @xmath0 was considered as a linear function of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and then friedmann equation has been written in terms of redshift .",
    "nonetheless , the dark energy cosmological parameters such as energy density , pressure and eos parameter have drawn with respect to redshift .",
    "the corresponding figures showed that the universe is undergoing accelerated expansion , and also eos parameter is consistent with observational data .",
    "next , we investigated stability conditions for the model by using of phase plane analysis . also , we obtained fixed points that these depended on parameters of the model and chaplygin gas .",
    "we considered linear perturbations for the fixed points , and then we obtained the condition of accelerated expansion by calculating corresponding eigenvalues ."
