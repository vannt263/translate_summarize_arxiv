    "how a disease spreads in a population is a question of much interest and relevance , and consequently has been extensively explored over the years @xcite .",
    "mathematically , epidemiological models have successfully captured the dynamics of infectious disease @xcite .",
    "one well known model for non - fatal communicable disease progression is the sirs cycle .",
    "this model appropriately describes the progression of diseases such as small pox , tetanus , influenza , typhoid fever , cholera and tuberculosis @xcite .",
    "the sirs cycle is described by the following stages . at the outset",
    "an individual is _ susceptible _ to infection ( a stage denoted by s ) . on being infected by contact with other infected people in the neighbourhood , the individual moves on to the _ infectious _ stage ( denoted by i ) .",
    "this is followed by a",
    "_ refractory _ stage ( denoted by r ) . in the refractory stage",
    "the individual becomes immune to disease and also does not infect others . but",
    "this immunity is temporary as the individual becomes susceptible again after some time interval .",
    "specifically , in this work we consider a cellular automata model of the sirs cycle described above @xcite . in this model of disease progression",
    ", time @xmath0 evolves in discrete steps , with each individual , indexed by @xmath1 on a @xmath2 dimensional lattice , characterized by a counter    @xmath3    describing its _ phase _ in the cycle of the disease @xcite .",
    "here @xmath4 , where @xmath5 signifies the total length of the disease cycle . at any instant of time _",
    ", if phase @xmath6(t ) = @xmath7 , then the individual at site @xmath1 is susceptible ; if @xmath8 , then it is infected ; if phase @xmath9 , it is in the refractory stage . for , phase @xmath10 the dynamics is given by the counter updating by @xmath11 every time step , and at the end of the refractory period the individual becomes susceptible again , which implies if @xmath12 then , @xmath13 .",
    "namely : @xmath14    hence the disease progression is a _ cycle _ ( see fig.[schematic ] ) .",
    "we consider the typical condition where the refractory period is longer than the infective stage , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "we now investigate the spread of epidemic in a group of spatially distributed individuals , where at the individual level the disease progresses in accordance with the sirs cycle . in particular , we consider a population of individuals on a @xmath2-dimensional lattice where every node , representing the individual , has @xmath16 neighbors @xcite . unlike many studies with periodic boundary conditions , here the boundaries are fixed and there are no individuals outside the boundaries .",
    "so our model mimics a patch of population , and investigates the persistence of infection in such a patch .",
    "_ condition for infection : _ here we consider the condition that a susceptible individual ( s ) will become infected ( i ) _ if one or more of its nearest neighbours are infected_. that is , if @xmath17 , ( namely , the individual is susceptible ) , then @xmath18 , if any @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "we first focus on the infection spreading patterns in the population .",
    "the principal question we ask is the following : when is infection persistent in a patch , and how this depends on the constitution of the initial population . in order to examine this",
    ", we study the spread of infection from a seed of infection ( namely one or two infected individuals ) across a patch of population composed of individuals at different stages in the disease cycle , and with varying degrees of heterogeneity in the population .    with no loss of generality we consider @xmath21 ; @xmath22 ; @xmath23 and a lattice of size @xmath24 . in our figures",
    "we represent the state of an individual in the disease cycle ( namely s , i or r ) by a color , with white denoting a susceptible individual , black denoting a refractory individual and red denoting an infected individual .",
    "the fraction of susceptible individuals in the population at time @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath25 , the fraction of infected individuals by @xmath26 and the fraction of refractory individuals by @xmath27 . in the sections below we",
    "will focus on the possibility of the prolonged existence of infection arising in different classes of initial populations , characterized by different @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "first we investigate the effect of an infected individual on a population patch where _ all individuals are entirely susceptible to infection_. namely , we consider the case where at the outset there is one infected individual and the rest of the population is in the susceptible state , with @xmath31 . fig .",
    "[ control ] displays the spreading patterns obtained in such a scenario .",
    "it is clearly evident that as time progresses the infection starts from the infected individual ( `` seed '' ) and spreads symmetrically .",
    "this symmetric spreading pattern is readily understood from the condition for infection , which turns susceptible individuals to infected if any one of their neighbors is infected .",
    "so the infected seed infects its four neighbors , and these newly infected individuals in turn infect their nearest four neighbours , and so on .",
    "this process leads to an isotropic wave of infection which stops at the boundaries .",
    "we confirmed the generality of these observations for different relative lengths of the infectious and refractory periods , namely varying @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 ) .",
    "we further ascertained that the choice of the location of the infected individual did not affect these qualitative trends .",
    "now the key factor in infection spreading is the contact of susceptible individuals with infected ones .",
    "it is clear that such an interaction takes place only at the outer edge of the wave of infection , while the inner boundary of the infected zone is contiguous only to refractory individuals .",
    "so the infection only spreads outwards , and does not move back into the interior of the lattice again .",
    "importantly then , the infection is removed after a while from the patch of population , and all the individuals ( including the original infective seed ) comes to the end of the disease cycle and becomes susceptible again .",
    "so there is no infective site left in the population to perpetuate the infection and initiate another wave of disease spreading .",
    "thus a _ fully susceptible population does not allow the infection to persist . _",

    "we first consider the case where the refractory individuals have phases @xmath44 , namely , they are at the start of the refractory stage of the disease cycle .",
    "we investigate the persistence of infection in heterogeneous populations , with the initial state having ( a ) a single seed of infection and ( b ) varying initial fractions of infected individuals @xmath45 . in both scenarios ,",

    "it is evident from these representative results that in a well mixed population , consisting of a random collection of both susceptible and refractory individuals , introduction of a single infected individual can lead to _ persistent infection in the population .",
    "_    this can be rationalized as follows : the mixed presence of susceptible and refractory individuals , implies that the disease cycles of the individuals in the population are _ not synchronized_. so there are always some individuals in the infective stage of the disease cycle in the population , and these act as seeds for continued infection propagation , leading to persistent infection . _ counter - intuitively then , the presence of individuals who are ( temporarily ) immune to the disease amongst susceptible ones leads to sustained infection , while in a completely susceptible population the infection dies out . _    , @xmath47 and @xmath38 ) , with one infected individual at @xmath35 . here",

    "in particular we investigate the nature of the persistent infection in the population under varying initial fractions of infected individuals @xmath30 .",
    "a typical random initial condition is shown in fig .",

    "it is clear that there is an _ approximate recurrence of the complex patterns of infected individuals in the population_. fig .",
    "[ time2 ] shows the time evolution of the fraction of infected , refractory and susceptible individuals in the population , namely @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath25 , in the case displayed in fig .",
    "[ time1 ] .",
    "it can be clearly seen that after transience , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath25 exhibit steady oscillatory dynamics , with period of oscillation close to the disease cycle length @xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed recurrence of the spatio - temporal patterns when persistent infection emerges .    a quantitative measure of the recurrence of patterns",
    "can also be obtained by calculating the difference of the state of the population from the initial state , as reflected by the hamming distance : @xmath54 where the sum is over all @xmath55 sites in the lattice .",
    "the time dependence of the hamming distance given above is shown in fig .",
    "[ hamming ] , and it clearly shows steady oscillations .",
    "this indicates that the fraction of the susceptible , infected and refractory individuals in the population , and more remarkably their _ locations _ , repeat almost periodically over time .",
    "it should be noted that the frequency of oscillation again approximately corresponds to the disease cycle length .     as a function of time , in a heterogeneous population comprising initially of a random mixture of individuals , with @xmath56 and @xmath52.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "another pertinent observation here is the dependence of this dynamics on disease cycle",
    ". as the length of the infectious stage ( i.e. @xmath32 ) increases , keeping the total disease cycle length invariant , the fraction of infected individuals @xmath26 increases .",
    "the average @xmath26 is proportional to the fraction of the disease cycle occupied by the infectious stage , i.e the ratio @xmath57 .",
    "so the size of the infected population strongly depends on the nature of disease as reflected in the length of the infectious stage of the disease .",
    "we now attempt to gauge the statistically significant trends in @xmath26 , by averaging the fraction of infected individuals at asymptotic time @xmath0 , arising from a wide range of initial configurations at time @xmath35 .",
    "we denote this by @xmath58 . in terms of this quantity ,",
    "persistent infection is indicated by a non - zero value . however , after sufficient transient timesteps , if @xmath58 is zero , it indicates that the infection has died out .",
    "so @xmath58 can serve as an order parameter for the transition to sustained infection in a population .      for fixed @xmath32 and @xmath5 we have calculated @xmath59 , for different initial fractions of susceptible individuals @xmath28 .",
    "we explore the full possible range of @xmath60 $ ] , where @xmath61 signifies a population comprised entirely of refractory individuals who are immune to infection initially , and @xmath62 implies an initial population comprised entirely of individuals susceptible to infection .",
    "while the phase of the susceptible ( s ) sub - population is @xmath43 of course , the refractory individuals ( r ) can be present in different stages in the refractory period with @xmath63 .",
    "we explore two different scenarios of the initial state of the refractory individuals in the population .",
    "( after transience ) with respect to the fraction of susceptible individuals in the initial population @xmath28 , arising from the presence of a single infected individual at time @xmath35 . here",
    "the refractory individuals have the same phase , the disease cycle has @xmath21 ; @xmath23 , and @xmath26 is averaged over @xmath64 realizations of the initial population on the lattice . the specific case of a @xmath24 lattice",
    "is displayed .",
    "however note that different lattice sizes yield the same result.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    first we present the case where all the refractory individuals are at the start of the refractory stage of the disease cycle , i.e. all @xmath53 .",
    "so there is uniformity in the stage of disease progression in the refractory sub - population , though the individuals are randomly distributed spatially .",
    "we focus on the asymptotic state of infection in such a population , arising from a single infected individual at the outset .",
    "the results obtained from a large sample of initial states is shown in fig .",
    "[ variation1 ] , and it is evident from there that @xmath58 is _ very low for both high and low @xmath28 _ , peaking around @xmath65 .",
    "namely , homogeneous initial populations where all individuals are immune ( @xmath66 ) , or all are susceptible to disease ( @xmath67 ) , do not yield persistent infection .",
    "rather , mixed populations lead to most sustained infection , with persistently high numbers of infected individuals .",
    "we can rationalize our observations as follows : if an infected individual is completely surrounded by refractory individuals with @xmath68 , it will complete the infectious stage without transferring the infection at all , as @xmath69 .",
    "so the infection can spread only if the infected seed is contiguous to at least one susceptible individual .",
    "now the probability of contact with a susceptible individual in the initial stages of infection spreading depends on the initial fraction of susceptibles @xmath28 .",
    "this suggests that when @xmath28 is low , the chance of the infected individual being in contact with a susceptible one is low . as a result , as @xmath28 tends to zero , on an average , the infection eventually gets removed from the population , with the seed of infection crossing over to the refractory phase without infecting any other individual .",
    "when there are more susceptible individuals in the initial population , there is a higher chance that the infected seed will encounter a susceptible neighbour .",
    "so as expected , increasing @xmath28 leads to a larger infected set on an average .",
    "however the surprising trend is the _ decrease _ in the infected set as the initial susceptible sub - population becomes too high , with the number of infected individuals tending to zero as the entire population becomes susceptible .",
    "this feels counter - intuitive , but can be understood as follows : consider the limiting case where initially almost all the individuals are susceptible to the infection .",
    "now the infection will spread immediately in isotropic waves , but will eventually stop at the boundaries . in analogy to the spread of forest fire ,",
    "the boundary of refractory individuals is like scorched earth preventing spread across them .",
    "now after the wave of infection passes , the individuals are in the refractory stage , leading eventually to the entire set being synchronized in the susceptible regime . there is no infected individual left then to act as a seed for a further wave of infection spreading .",
    "so the infection does not persist .",
    "the susceptible stage is like an `` absorbing state '' , and in the absence of `` infectious perturbation '' the system remains fixed in that state .    in order to prevent the above scenario , one needs enough refractory individuals in the population .",
    "when @xmath29 is below @xmath70 ( i.e. @xmath71 ) , typically the infected seed may not have a refractory individual among its four neighbours .",
    "so one expects that the persisting infection will have lower probability of occurrence as @xmath28 increases beyond @xmath72 .",
    "this is in accordance with the trends observed in the simulations .",
    "we then see that for the _ infection to persist _ in a population , a _ well mixed heterogeneous population is required _ , with reasonable number of both susceptible and refractory individuals . _",
    "randomly mixed populations prevent synchronization of the disease _ , and this is the key to always having some source of infection left in the population .",
    "we now vary the initial fraction of infected individuals @xmath30 in the population , over the entire range @xmath73 $ ] . for the remaining population",
    ", the initial fraction of susceptible and refractory individuals is set at different ratios .",
    "we consider an ensemble of initial conditions , with specific @xmath30 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 and find the time averaged @xmath26 , after long transience for each realization .",
    "the ensemble average of this quantity is displayed in fig .",
    "notably , we find that there is a definite _ window of persistence _ over the range of @xmath30 , where the infection never dies down and the fraction of infected individuals in the population is reasonably high on an average .",
    "( after transience ) with respect to the initial fraction of infected individuals @xmath30 in the population , and @xmath74 .",
    "the refractory sub - population consists of individuals with phase equal to @xmath75 . here",
    "the disease cycle has @xmath21 ; @xmath23 , and @xmath26 is averaged over @xmath64 initial realizations .",
    "the specific case of a @xmath24 lattice is displayed .",
    "however note that different lattices sizes yield the same result.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    in the state where infection is persistent , the individuals are unsynchronized and spread over the different stages of the disease cycle .",
    "so on an average the fraction of infected individuals is @xmath76 , namely the fraction of the total disease cycle occupied by the infected stage .",
    "for instance , in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ i0 ] with @xmath39 and @xmath77 , at the plateau of persistence , the infected fraction is approximately one - third of the population .",
    "the transition to persistent infection is sharp and occurs at @xmath78 .",
    "this implies that _ the infection can spread and persist even when there is only a single infected individual in the initial population_. this is consistent with the results we presented earlier ( cf .",
    "[ variation1 ] ) on infection spreading from a single infected individual .",
    "interestingly , the infection ceases to persist for higher values of @xmath30 , and the fall in persistence is rapid .",
    "that is , if the initial population has too many infected individuals , infection will not persist .",
    "this can be rationalized by noting that one needs a mix of susceptibles and refractory individuals in the population for persistent infection .",
    "for instance , considering the limiting case of all infected individuals in the initial state , it is clear that all individuals will go through the disease cycle in synchrony .",
    "so all individuals will become susceptible again together , but there will be no infective seed left in the population to perpetuate the infection .",
    "now we will explore the effect of non - uniformity within the refractory sub - population on the emergence of persistent infections .",
    "namely , we will consider the refractory individuals in the initial population to be in different stages of disease progression .",
    "we will consider two distinct ways of interpolating between the completely heterogeneous and completely uniform limiting cases , in order to gauge the effect of heterogeneity on sustaining infection .",
    "first we consider the initial refractory sub - population to be an admixture of subsets of individuals with uniform phase and with randomly distributed phases .",
    "specifically , we explore initial refractory sub - populations comprised of some fraction @xmath79 with phases randomly distributed over the range @xmath80 to @xmath5 , and the rest @xmath81 with fixed phase @xmath82 .",
    "we examine the spread and persistence of infection in such a scenario , under variation of the initial composition of the population .",
    "fig  [ transition - p ] exhibits the persistence of infection , with respect to varying @xmath28 , arising in a population that had a single infected individual initially .",
    "different fractions of the initial refractory sub - population with randomized phases were explored , ranging from @xmath83 ( i.e. completely uniform ) , to @xmath84 ( i.e. completely heterogeneous ) .",
    "the trends clearly indicate a continuous cross - over from the condition where all refractory individuals are in the same phase , to the scenario where all are in random phases .",

    "[ i0_n ] exhibits the change in the window of persistence with respect to @xmath79 .",
    "it is evident that increasing @xmath79 , namely increasing the initial number of refractory individuals with _ de - synchronized phases _ , leads to a definite increase in the window of persistence .",
    "this implies that _ for populations with a more heterogeneous refractory sub - population , the disease persists over a larger range of infected fractions @xmath30 of the initial population_.    note however , that there is also an apparent reduction in the window of persistence at very high @xmath79 .",
    "this can be rationalized by noting that when the entire initial refractory sub - population @xmath29 has uniformly distributed phases , there are a significant number of individuals who are closer to the end of their disease cycle ( for instance , stage @xmath87 or @xmath41 ) .",
    "these individuals become susceptible within a few time steps , and therefore bring the population closer to an overall state of homogeneity again , as all susceptibles are in the same phase ( stage 0 ) and remain in that phase unless infected .",
    "we have observed qualitatively and quantitatively earlier , that a more homogeneous population leads to a reduced window of persistence .",
    "hence , _ presence of a significant number of individuals closer to the end of their disease cycle acts as a homogenizing factor for the population and is detrimental to persistence_.",
    "lastly , we study the effect of varying ranges of spread in the initial phases of the refractory individuals . specifically we consider that the phase of the refractory individuals in the initial population to be randomly distributed over different ranges @xmath88 . in particular we examine the persistence of infection for @xmath88 ranging from @xmath89 $ ] , ( where all refractory individuals have the same phase ) to [ @xmath80 , @xmath90 ( where heterogeneity is large as the phases of the refractory individuals are distributed over the entire refractory range ) .    fig .",

    "it can be clearly seen that a smooth cross - over takes place from the extremal case of all refractory individuals in the same phase , to the limit where the stages of the refractory individuals are spread randomly over the entire refractory period .",
    "the key observation here is that as the spread in phases increases , the range of persistent infection becomes larger .",

    "( after transience ) with respect to initial fraction of susceptible individuals @xmath28 , for the refractory individuals having phases @xmath92 randomly distributed over different ranges @xmath88 in the refractory stage : [ 5,5 ] ; [ 5,7 ] ; [ 5,9 ] ; [ 5,11 ] ; [ 5,13 ] .",

    "but in a completely uniform population , a higher fraction of susceptibles leads to persistent infection .",
    "this has the following important implication : when refractory individuals are not synchronized at the same phase of disease progression , even if there are few susceptible individuals in the population initially , the infection grows substantially and the average size of the infected sub - population is large .",
    "so we have demonstrated that even when the entire population is susceptible to infection , the infection eventually dies out , while even a few susceptibles among an heterogeneous refractory population gives rise to a large persistent infected sub - population .    we can rationalize this counter - intuitive trend that persistent infection is more likely when the number of susceptible individuals in the initial population is low , as follows :",
    "when @xmath28 is low , there are many refractory individuals in the population surrounding the infected individual .",
    "these individuals are in various stages in the refractory period , and some become susceptible again while the seed is still infectious .",
    "if @xmath95 and the refractory individuals are uniformly distributed over the refractory range @xmath33 , the probability of the seed encountering a susceptible individual while still infectious is proportional to @xmath96 .",
    "since at least one neighbour in contact with the seed needs to be susceptible , this probability should be greater than @xmath97 for the infection to spread , on an average .",
    "so when the infective stage @xmath32 is sufficiently long ( as in our example of @xmath98 , in a disease cycle of length @xmath41 ) , extremely low initial @xmath28 can also lead to persistent infection .",
    "in summary , we have explored the emergence of persistent infection in a patch of population , where the disease progression of the individuals was given by the sirs model and an individual became infected on contact with another infected individual .",
    "we investigated the infection spreading qualitatively and quantitatively , under varying degrees of heterogeneity in the initial population .    specifically , we considered two scenarios extrapolating between the completely homogeneous and completely heterogeneous limit .",
