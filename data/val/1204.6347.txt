    "whose spin degree of freedom is not frozen by magnetic fields  @xcite spin rotations and condensate phase combine to form a larger set of physically distinguishable degenerate states .",
    "this is analogous to liquid @xmath1he where superfluidity is formed by cooper pairs of fermions that exhibit a nonzero spin and orbital angular momentum , resulting in a rich phenomenology of phases with different broken symmetries  @xcite . a variety of different vortex configurations  @xcite and other defects and textures  @xcite",
    "have been theoretically studied and experimentally observed in the resulting multi - component order parameter manifolds of superfluid liquid @xmath1he .",
    "there are obvious parallels  @xcite to similar objects in cosmology  @xcite and quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is not surprising that in multicomponent becs , there has been an increasing interest in theoretical studies of topological defects and textures  @xcite as well as vector solitons  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical work has been produced parallel with a rapid experimental progress on spinor becs , e.g. , in controlled preparation of coreless spinor vortices  @xcite , in the studies of spin - texture formation  @xcite , and in nonequilibrium vortex production during rapid phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "an atomic spin-1 bec exhibits two phases of the ground - state manifold , ferromagnetic ( fm ) and polar , with distinct broken symmetries . in the fm phase the ground state of a sufficiently rapidly rotating atom cloud is formed by nonsingular , coreless vortices",
    "in which the order parameter is well - defined everywhere  @xcite .",
    "similar coreless vortices were first described in superfluid liquid @xmath1he  @xcite and were recently experimentally phase - imprinted on a spinor bec  @xcite . due to the topology of the fm ground - state manifold , which is defined by the group of spin rotations ,",
    "it is also possible to form a singular vortex  @xcite , whose stability and structure , however , is much less well understood .",
    "here we show that singular , singly quantized vortices can be energetically stable in both fm and polar phases of a spin-1 bec . in the fm phase this is despite the fact that the coreless vortex has a lower energy .",
    "although a singular vortex would also not be nucleated by rotation , once created , for example by phase - imprinting , it can be stabilized in a rotating trap . in the polar phase ,",
    "the singular vortex undergoes a core deformation to a pair of half - quantum vortices in an extended vortex core region where the broken order parameter symmetry of the polar ground - state manifold is restored ( see fig .  [",

    "the vortex line singularity has now split into two half - quantum vortices with the atoms in the ferromagnetic phase at the precise location of the singularities . in both figures",

    "the topological properties of the vortex are the same as those in ( a ) . ]    in a singular defect the singularity of the order parameter is contained by a defect core .",
    "unlike scalar superfluids , in the spinor bec this does not imply that the density must vanish : it is also possible to accommodate the singularity by requiring the spinor wavefunction to be orthogonal to the ground - state manifold at the precise location of the singularity .",
    "the different possibilities for the defect core structure leads to an energetic hierarchy of different characteristic length scales  @xcite : depending on the ratio of the spin @xmath2 and density @xmath3 healing lengths associated with the two interaction strengths of spin-1 bec , it can be energetically more favorable to force the order parameter value to be orthogonal to the ground - state manifold at the defect singularity than to force the density to zero .",
    "this can lead to unexpected core structures . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown how in the polar phase of a spin-1 bec a singular point defect with a vanishing density at the singularity can spontaneously deform to a ring defect with a fm core and a nonvanishing density .",
    "recently symmetry classification using homotopy theory was used in the analysis of defect cores in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in a spin-1 bec",
    "the polar and fm phases differ by the local expectation value of the spin magnitude .",
    "the size of the filled vortex core is then determined by @xmath2 that defines the length scale over which the spin magnitude heals when locally perturbed .",
    "this is in general much larger than the size @xmath3 of a density - depleted vortex core .",
    "large wavefunction gradients close to the defect singularity result in a large order - parameter bending energy .",
    "energetically , the system therefore prefers the larger core size and a nonvanishing atom density with correspondingly lower bending energy . outside the filled core region of size @xmath2 the topology of the vortex",
    "is the same as in the case of a zero - density vortex line . in that region",
    "the order parameter bending energy is not sufficient to excite the system away from the ground - state manifold and we find a well - defined broken order parameter symmetry of either the polar or fm phase .",
    "it is only inside the filled core of size @xmath2 where the vortex structure differs .",
    "inside the core the order parameter bending energy restores the order parameter symmetry of the full spin-1 condensate wavefunction by exciting the system out of the ground - state manifold by mixing the polar and fm phases . in our numerical simulations this is indicated by a continuously varying spin magnitude across the vortex core .",
    "we show that in the case of a singular singly quantized fm vortex the apparent complexity of the core can in this way be explained as the formation of a single core with @xmath4 at the singularity : an initial singular vortex is formed by overlapping vortex lines in the spinor components . as the system relaxes , the density depletion is avoided by separating the vortex lines . by a rotation of the spinor basis , the axial symmetry of density profiles of the individual spinor components with perfectly overlapping vortex lines is explicitly restored , and the vortex is identified as one in which the spin vector winds by @xmath5 around a polar core .",
    "we find both axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric solutions for the singular vortex in the fm phase , indicating close energetic degeneracy of the solutions .    in the polar phase",
    ", we use the same analysis to show how it is energetically favorable for the system to spontaneously break axial symmetry by splitting the core of a singly quantized vortex into two fm cores .",
    "the resulting spinor wavefunction shows a complex combination of vortex lines with highly deformed anisotropic cores .",
    "however by transforming the spinor wavefunction to the basis specified by the direction of the spin in the fm cores , the spinor structure is identified as a pair of half - quantum vortices . outside the deformed core",
    ", the topology of the initial singly quantized vortex is preserved .",
    "the splitting can be understood from the nematic symmetry properties of the polar order parameter .",
    "a stable nonaxisymmetric singular vortex with a nonzero superfluid density at the core has been theoretically predicted  @xcite and experimentally observed  @xcite in superfluid liquid @xmath1he .",
    "here we analyze the energetic stability of the singular vortices and explain the structures of the their cores by numerical simulations in the framework of mean - field theory .",

    "[ sec : mft ] we give a brief overview of mean - field theory for the spin-1 bec and explain the general concepts used in our analysis . in sec .  [ sec : fm - vortex ] we demonstrate the energetic stability and explain the core structure of a singular vortex in the fm phase .",

    "analytic properties of the vortex solutions and the basis transformations are provided in appendix  [ append ] .",
    "in our analysis of singular vortices of a spin-1 atomic bec , we consider the classical ( gross - pitaevskii ) mean - field theory of a harmonically trapped system that results in a spatially nonuniform atom density . in an optical trapping potential the atomic spin",

    "the spins of two colliding spin-1 atoms may combine to a relative angular momentum of either @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "this implies that the contact interaction results from two different contributions , corresponding to the two scattering channels with different @xmath22-wave scattering lengths @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the two scattering contributions lead to the two interaction terms in eq .",

    "the spin - dependent interaction term @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian - density ] ) determines the spin magnitude in a uniform ground - state spin distribution .",
    "if @xmath28 , as is the case for @xmath29rb , the spin - dependent contribution to the interaction energy will favor the fm state with @xmath30 throughout the bec .",
    "conversely if @xmath31 , as for @xmath32na , the polar state with @xmath4 will be favored .    the two interaction strengths @xmath33 and @xmath27 are each associated with a characteristic length scale . from the spin - independent interaction",
    "we can derive the healing length @xmath34 that defines the length scale over which the density heals around a local depletion of the atom density  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is similar in a scalar bec , which exhibits a healing length depending on the atom density and the scattering length . due to the spin - dependent interaction term ,",
    "we now , however , have an additional healing length , analogously given by @xmath35 .",
    "this defines the length scale over which the spin magnitude @xmath36 heals when locally perturbed .    as in a scalar bec , single - valuedness of the order parameter",
    "may be maintained at a defect singularity by requiring that the density vanishes there .",
    "the size of the defect core is then given by the healing length @xmath3 .",
    "however , the spinor order parameter makes it possible to maintain a nonzero density at the cost of requiring that the wavefunction at the singularity becomes orthogonal to the ground - state manifold .",
    "for example , a singularity in the fm manifold where @xmath30 can be accommodated by having @xmath4 on the vortex line .",
    "this constitutes a local perturbation of the spin magnitude , and so its length scale is determined by @xmath2 , which is usually larger than @xmath3 .",
    "the energetic cost of the local change in spin magnitude due to increased interaction energy may be offset by the lower bending energy in the larger core .",
    "the two phases of the spin-1 bec are described by very different order parameters , which leads to dramatically different possible vortex states . in the following",
    "we shall first consider the fm phase and show that a singular , singly quantized vortex can be energetically stable , and describe how its core structure can be understood in terms of the energetics of characteristic length scales [ sec .",
    "[ sec : fm - vortex ] ] .",
    "we will then apply a similar analysis to show how the deformed core of a stable singly quantised vortex in the polar phase can be identified as a pair of half - quantum vortices [ sec .",
    "[ sec : polar - vortex ] ] .",
    "we first consider vortices in the fm phase of a spin-1 bec . the system becomes fm when the interaction term @xmath28 in the hamiltonian ; energetically it is then favorable to maximize the spin magnitude everywhere in space , so that @xmath30 .",
    "a general fm spinor wavefunction can be constructed from the representative spinor @xmath37 with @xmath38 by incorporating a macroscopic condensate phase @xmath39 and by a spin rotation @xmath40 , defined by three euler angles .",
    "we obtain @xmath41 where . the local spin vector is then given by @xmath42 .",
    "order - parameter space is the manifold of energetically degenerate spinors @xmath43 . degenerate fm spinors [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : fm ] ) ] differ only by rotations in spin - space given by the euler angles @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the order - parameter space therefore corresponds to the group of three - dimensional rotations @xmath47 .",
    "the topological stability of line defects is characterized by the way closed contours encircling the defect map into order parameter space  @xcite .",
    "if the order - parameter space image of such a closed loop can be contracted to a point , the defect is not topologically stable .",
    "@xmath47 may be represented geometrically as @xmath48 ( the unit sphere in four dimensions ) with diametrically opposite points identified .",
    "the only closed loops that can not be contracted to a point are those connecting such identified points an odd number of times ( but these loops can all be deformed into one another ) .",
    "there are therefore only two distinct classes of vortices : singular vortices corresponding to non - contractible loops , and non - singular vortices corresponding to contractible loops  @xcite .",
    "all the singular vortices with an odd - integer winding number are therefore topologically equivalent to a singly quantized singular vortex and all singular vortices with an even - integer winding number are topologically equivalent to a non - singular vortex - free state . mathematically , this is indicated by the first homotopy group of @xmath47 which has two elements [ @xmath49 that represent the two topological equivalence classes for the vortices .",
    "typical examples of a non - singular coreless vortex forming a continuous spin texture and singular spin vortex with radial and cross disgyrations of the spin vector are schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fm - vortex - schematic ] .     and @xmath50 .",
    "the coreless vortex is lower in energy in the whole frequency range . ]    in the fm phase , circulation need not be quantized  @xcite . a striking manifestation of this fact is the possibility of having a coreless vortex , which may be written @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the azimuthal angle and the euler angle @xmath45 varies with the radial distance @xmath53 from the @xmath7 axis .",
    "the spin texture is kept continuous by having @xmath54 as @xmath55 .",
    "the coreless vortex carries angular momentum , yet can be continuously deformed into a vortex - free state .",
    "because the fm order parameter is well - defined and non - singular everywhere in space ( a coreless vortex forms a continuous spin texture ) the coreless vortex belongs to the class of non - singular vortices .",
    "it is the spinor - bec analogue of the anderson - toulouse and mermin - ho vortices in @xmath1he  @xcite , which differ by the imposed boundary conditions at the container wall .",
    "the superfluid velocity  @xcite @xmath56 goes smoothly to zero at the center of the vortex but increases away from it as @xmath45 increases .",
    "the spin forms a characteristic fountain texture . in the atomic gas",
    ", there is no hard container wall , and the amount by which @xmath57 turns as @xmath58 increases from the vortex center to the edge of the cloud is not fixed .",
    "the total circulation can thus vary smoothly as the value of @xmath45 at the edge of the cloud adapts to the imposed rotation.he the angular momentum is fixed at the cylinder wall , fixing the boundary condition of the coreless vortex texture . for a fixed boundary condition the system can exhibit a conserved winding number defined by an integral of the spin vector expression similar to the topological charge density of a point defect over the surface covering the upper hemisphere  @xcite . ]",
    "the simplest way to construct a singly quantized singular vortex in the fm phase is as a @xmath5-winding of the condensate phase @xmath39 .",
    "the vortex can then be described by the spinor @xmath59 where the density is required to vanish on the singular vortex line along the @xmath7 axis ( where all the three spinor components are singular ) .",
    "the euler angle @xmath45 is arbitrary but constant , giving a uniform spin distribution ( which , without loss of generality , we assume to be in the @xmath60 plane such that @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fm ] ) ) .",
    "we may continuously deform @xmath62 into another vortex in the same class of topological line defects through purely local operations .",

    "( [ eq : fm ] ) by letting @xmath63 while @xmath64 , @xmath65 yielding a singular vortex with a circulation of the spin around the core ( spin vortex ) .",
    "this is similar to a radial disgyration of the angular momentum in an analogous vortex structure in @xmath1he  @xcite .",
    "the fm order parameter is still singular at @xmath66 because a singularity is introduced in the fm spin vector . at @xmath67",
