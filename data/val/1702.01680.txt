    "we begin with two orthonormal bases @xmath24 of a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space @xmath25 to depict the two measurement settings @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "our ( un)certainty relations are applicable in the following experimental scheme . @xmath26 a similar scenario peres used in his book  @xcite at page  93 to interpret the position - momentum ur . in proposal  , clearly , the two measurements have no influence whatsoever on each other .    throughout the text",

    "both @xmath43 and @xmath44 are  the standard @xmath47-simplices  compact convex subsets of the @xmath0-dimensional real vector space @xmath48 , and their cartesian product @xmath49 is a compact convex subset of @xmath12 [ see appendix  [ sec : compact - convex - w ] ] .",
    "basically , @xmath50 is determined by the conditions .",
    "performing measurement on every qudit using a single setting , say @xmath2 , looks like throwing a @xmath0-sided dice , every time .",
    "the vector @xmath4 alone is limited by and that specify @xmath43 , which is also the probability space of a @xmath0-sided dice . whereas the experimental scheme   is not similar to throwing one out of two @xmath0-sided dices at a time ,",
    "although @xmath50 is the probability space of two dices : every pure or mixed state of a qudit gives a unique pair @xmath51 by the born rule [ see and ] , but _ not every _",
    "pair @xmath51 has a quantum state .",
    "for example , if @xmath52 for some @xmath53 , then one can not get always the same outcome : @xmath31 in the @xmath2-setting and @xmath32 in the @xmath3-setting . in other words , there exists no quantum state in this case that can provide @xmath10 , where @xmath54 , which identifies an extreme point of @xmath50 .",
    "so , other than  , there are certain constraints that are purely quantum mechanical in nature and must be obeyed by @xmath4 and @xmath5 _ together_. in our case , qcs are the tis given in  , which arise naturally from the structure of hilbert space on which quantum theory is based . to write the tis , we need @xmath55 that is the probability of getting outcome @xmath56 if @xmath57 ( or @xmath58 if @xmath59 ) is our state for the system .",
    "like @xmath60 and @xmath61 in  , @xmath62 is the angle between the pure states @xmath59 and @xmath57 . in the subscripts of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , from left",

    "sum of all the entries in each row and every column of @xmath68 is one , thus it is a doubly stochastic matrix .",
    "if the two measurement settings described by are physically the same , then @xmath68 will be a permutation matrix .",
    "for every state vector @xmath70 , there are three tis latexmath:[\\[\\label{t - ineq-3 }    attached to each entry in @xmath69 .",
    "these tis [ see ] are derived in appendix  [ sec : der - q - const ] .    for simplicity , out the three tis  , here",
    "we choose only one @xmath72 angles @xmath60 and @xmath61 vary , whereas @xmath64 is fixed , as we change the state vector @xmath28 .",
    "the kets that saturates ti   for certain @xmath53 lie in the linear span of @xmath73 [ consider and with @xmath74 from appendix  [ sec : der - q - const ] ] . in the triangle _ equality _ ( te ) @xmath75 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are reminiscent of complementary angles from planar geometry , and @xmath76 .",

    "all those pairs @xmath51 that obey qc   for every @xmath79 build the combined - probability space @xmath80 for the two measurement bases in . in the case of @xmath81 ,",
    "even if we consider all tis given in for each @xmath79 , they do not capture the full qcs for a general pair of settings .",
    "therefore , one can still find some @xmath82 that corresponds to no quantum state .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis relies on the following fact : _ every @xmath10 that does not belong to @xmath80 can not be obtained from a quantum state , thus it is discarded . _ to investigate a space @xmath83that contains all those , and only those , pairs @xmath10 that originate from the quantum states  is not the aim of this paper .",
    "however , it is not tough to realize that @xmath84 for @xmath22 ; in general , @xmath85 .    note that @xmath80 is a _ proper _ subset of @xmath50 . to prove",
    "this one can show : only one out of the two extreme points ",
    "specified by @xmath54 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87of @xmath50 can belong to @xmath80 .",
    "recall that if and only if @xmath88 then the point described by @xmath54 belongs to @xmath80 , otherwise @xmath89 will be violated . secondly",
    ", if @xmath88 then @xmath90 , and @xmath91 can not be obeyed by the other point ; hence that lies outside of @xmath80 .",
    "the space @xmath80 is  held by the conditions   and a compact and convex subset of @xmath12 [ for a proof , see appendix  [ sec : compact - convex - w ] ] .",
    "every point of such a set can be written as a convex combination of its extreme points due to the krein - milman theorem ( see theorem  @xmath13 and appendix  a.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "we begin our journey from an interior point of @xmath80 in appendix  [ sec : interior - w ] and arrive at its extreme points at the end of appendix  [ sec : extreme - w ] .",
    "there it is concluded that the set of all extreme points of @xmath80 comes from a family of parametric curves .",
    "one can skip all those technical details and start constructing the parametric curves straight from the conclusion  : the first step is to pick a set of @xmath92 angles from a single column or row of the matrix @xmath69 given in .",
    "such a set is called @xmath92-set , and @xmath93 .",
    "for instance , we pick the top @xmath92 angles @xmath94 from the first column .",
    "then we associate @xmath92 tes with the @xmath92-set as @xmath95 by taking @xmath96 , where the subscript  1 reflects the selected column .    next , with   and",
    ", we assign @xmath97 probabilities to the angles : @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "they create the probability vectors @xmath100 one can observe that @xmath101 serves as a vector - valued function of a single real parameter @xmath96 , thus it exhibits a parametric curve .",
    "since the curve is associated with an @xmath92-set and all its points obey @xmath92 tes  , we call it an @xmath92-parametric curve",
    ".    a part of the curve , identified by the upper and lower limits @xmath102 , lies in @xmath80 and represents its extreme points because @xmath101 can not be written into a convex combination of other points of @xmath80 . in appendix",
    "[ sec : limit - beta-1 ] , we realize that the two limits are fixed by @xmath103 [ see ] .",
    "equations   and are like eq .  , whose roots are stated in .",
    "always the root with +  sign delivers the correct limit [ for justifications , see the last paragraph in appendix  [ sec : limit - beta-1 ] ] .",
    "if one chooses an @xmath92-set from a row of @xmath69 , say @xmath104 , then the @xmath92-parametric curve is constructed as @xmath105 now the parameter is @xmath106}$ ] , and the limits are determined by @xmath107 one can check that , for @xmath108 , both  and  describe the same thing , provided @xmath109 and @xmath110 are identical in both the cases .",
    "so an @xmath92-parametric curve is identified by an @xmath92-set and the positions of @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( that is , @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "let us count the total number of curves such as describe by . one can harvest @xmath113 distinct @xmath92-sets from a single column of @xmath69 , and there are total @xmath0 columns . the probability @xmath111 can take @xmath114 separate places in @xmath4 of   for distinct @xmath109 , and @xmath112 can take @xmath115 separate places in @xmath5 of   for distinct @xmath110 .",
    "thus we have @xmath116 individual @xmath92-parametric curves with a single @xmath92-set .",
    "since @xmath93 , we collect @xmath117 number of curves , where each @xmath92-set is made of angles from a column of @xmath69 .",
    "we secure the same number if we consider rows , rather than columns , to build an @xmath92-set and then a curve such as given by . for @xmath108 , every @xmath92-set is a part of a row as well as a part of a column .",
    "so , to avoid double counting errors , we take the cases @xmath108 and @xmath118 separately . in total , there are @xmath119\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] number of parametric curves for a qudit .",
    "if one adopts a suitable concave function @xmath120 on the combined space @xmath80 to estimate the uncertainty , then its absolute minimum will occur _ only _ at the parametric curves ( see theorem  @xmath15 and appendix  a.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "so ultimately one needs to find absolute minima of , at most , @xmath121 $ ] functions , each of a single variable [ for example , see  ] . then the smallest minimum will be the lower bound @xmath122 in a ur",
    "this task can be easily completed with a regular computer . in the next two sections ,",
    "we discuss certain concave as well as convex functions on @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath123 quantifies the uncertainty  about the outcomes @xmath31 when a qudit is measured in the basis @xmath23 of then @xmath123 should be a concave function of @xmath124 .",
    "it is because mixing probability distributions , @xmath125 and @xmath126 as @xmath127 with @xmath128}$ ] , can only increase uncertainty @xmath129 ( see chapter  9 in @xcite ) . in this regard , every mixed state ,",
    "say @xmath130 , has more uncertainty .",
    "so , here , we adopt a real - valued smooth concave function @xmath131 as an uncertainty measure . to prove @xmath132 is a concave function on @xmath43 , it is sufficient to demonstrate that the @xmath133 hessian matrix  that is a symmetric matrix of second - order partial derivatives of @xmath123is a negative semidefinite matrix at every point in @xmath43 ( see theorem  @xmath134 in @xcite ) . at an interior point ( where all @xmath135 ) of @xmath43 , the entry in the @xmath136th row and @xmath137th column @xmath138 in the hessian matrix is @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 is the kronecker delta function .",
    "these entries indeed provide a negative definite matrix , thus @xmath132 is strictly concave in the interior of @xmath43 . at a boundary point ( where one or more @xmath142 ) , all the partial derivatives in a certain row(s ) and column(s ) of the hessian matrix become zero , thus the matrix turns out to be a negative semidefinite and @xmath132 to be a concave function . by the way , @xmath132 can be employed for the entanglement detection ( see remark  2 in @xcite ) .    if the state vector @xmath28 is an equal superposition of all the kets in @xmath23 or the state is completely mixed , then all the outcomes @xmath31 will be equally probable : @xmath143 for every @xmath144 is the center of @xmath43 , where @xmath132 reaches its maximum value @xmath145 . whereas , only in the case of a definite outcome  that is when @xmath146 , and then @xmath147 for a particular @xmath148we have the minimum uncertainty @xmath149 as it should be . note that @xmath147 characterizes an extreme point of @xmath43 .    to establish a measure of combined uncertainty for the experimental proposal  , we take the same function , @xmath150 for the @xmath3-setting . like @xmath132 of",

    "now we define our combined uncertainty measure @xmath153 on the convex set @xmath80 , rather than @xmath50 .",
    "sum of two concave functions is concave , so @xmath154 is also a concave function .",
    "a mixed quantum state is a convex combination of pure states , the probabilities @xmath155 are linear functions of the state @xmath156 ( @xmath157 , @xmath158 ) , and @xmath80 is a compact and convex set . as a result , every @xmath159 associated with any ( pure or mixed ) quantum state lies in @xmath80 . and , because @xmath154 is a concave function on @xmath80 , our ur given in applies to every state for a qudit .",
    "this is also true in the case of other ( un)certainty relations presented in sec .",
