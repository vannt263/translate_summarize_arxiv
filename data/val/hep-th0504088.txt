    "in the gauge theory , only the gauge invariant quantities are observable , since gauge non - invariant quantities change their values by the gauge transformation and can not take definite values .",
    "the dimension - three quark - antiquark bilinear operator @xmath4 and the dimension - four gluon operator @xmath5 are typical gauge - invariant operators in qcd .",
    "they are local operators defined on a spacetime point .",
    "we wish to discuss how the gauge noninvariant operator may be gauge invariant .",
    "if we do not restrict to the local operator , we can enlarge the candidates of the gauge invariant operator . in this paper",
    ", we focus on composite operators of mass dimension two , since they were taken up by many papers from the analytical and numerical viewpoints , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "for example , we know that the squared potential @xmath6 of yang - mills theory is gauge variant",
    ". however , the minimized squared potential @xmath7 with respect to the gauge transformation @xmath8 in euclidean space is clearly gauge invariant @xcite , since @xmath6 can not be negative and has a non - negative minimum and hence @xmath7 no longer change the value under the gauge transformation .",
    "thus , the composite operator of mass dimension two can be gauge invariant by this procedure in classical gauge theory .",
    "in quantum theory , however , we can not measure the value of the operator itself and can measure only the vacuum expectation value of the operator . in this sense , the gauge invariance of the operator stated in the above ( _ strong gauge invariance in the operator level _ ) is too strong .",
    "if the gauge theory is written in terms of the gauge potential , we must fix the gauge in quantizing the gauge theory and the becchi - rouet - stora - tyutin ( brst ) symmetry in quantum gauge theory plays a role of the gauge symmetry of classical gauge theory .",
    "therefore , we can check whether the ( elementary or composite ) operator is gauge invariant or not , respectively , by examining whether or not the vacuum expectation value of the operator keeps the value under deforming gauge fixing condition .",
    "it is the _ weak gauge invariance _",
    "( _ the gauge - fixing - condition independence _ ) that we wish to discuss in this paper .",
    "a first step in this direction shown in @xcite is a fact that the spacetime average of the mixed gluon ",
    "ghost condensate of mass dimension two , @xmath9 is brst invariant in the generalized lorentz gauge and the modified maximal abelian gauge , although the operator @xmath10 is gauge variant .",
    "this claim is based on the on - shell brst invariance of the operator @xmath11 .",
    "here it is essential to take both the spacetime average and the vacuum expectation value .",
    "recently , slavnov @xcite has shown that the spacetime average of the dimension two condensate , @xmath12 is _ gauge invariant _ by using a noncommutative field theory technique under three hypothesis .",
    "subsequently , he has shown @xcite that the averaged condensate @xmath13 in the abelian gauge theory is _ gauge independent _ , i.e. , _ gauge - fixing - parameter independent _ without using the noncommutative technique and in the standard commutative formalism , i.e. , the averaged condensate does not change at least in the abelian gauge theory when the gauge - fixing - parameter is changed .",
    "in view of these , we expect that the @xmath10 can become gauge invariant only after taking both the spacetime average and the vacuum expectation value , i.e. , @xmath14 . note that either the spacetime average , @xmath15 , or the vacuum expectation value , @xmath16 , is not expected to be gauge invariant .    what we wish to discuss in this paper is the _ gauge - fixing - condition independence _ of the dimension two condensate , rather than the gauge - fixing - parameter independence , in the non - abelian gauge theory in the standard commutative yang - mills theory formalism .    in this paper , we give a formal proof that the space - time average of a vacuum condensate of mass dimension two @xmath17 is gauge invariant in the weak sense that it is independent of the gauge - fixing condition adopted in quantizing the yang - mills theory , at least for the small deformation from the generalized lorentz and the modified maximal abelian gauge when we neglect gribov copies . in the final section ,",
    "we examine if the statement holds by restricting the functional integral to the gribov region or the fundamental modular region , when the gribov copies exist .",
    "for our purpose , it is convenient to adopt the quantization method based on the functional integration .",
