    "the telescope array  ( ta ) experiment  @xcite is a hybrid ultra - high energy ( uhe ) cosmic ray detector covering about 700  km@xmath3 in central utah , usa . it is composed of a surface detector ( sd ) array and three fluorescence detector ( fd ) stations .",
    "the ta sd array consists of 507 plastic scintillator detectors on a square grid with 1.2  km spacing  @xcite .",
    "they each contain two layers of @xmath4 cm thick plastic scintillator 3  m@xmath3 in area .",
    "the three fd stations  @xcite contain a total of 38 telescopes overlooking the air space above the array of scintillator detectors .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present the photon search capabilities of the telescope array surface detector and to search for primary photons in the cosmic ray flux .",
    "we place the limits on the integral flux of photons for energies greater than @xmath5 , where @xmath5 takes values @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2ev .    at present",
    "there is no experimental evidence for primary uhe photons .",
    "however , several limits on the photon flux have been set by independent experiments .",
    "these include haverah park  @xcite , agasa  @xcite , yakutsk  @xcite ( see also reanalyses of the agasa  @xcite and agasa@xmath6yakutsk  @xcite data at energies greater than @xmath2  ev ) and the pierre auger observatory  @xcite .",
    "photon limits may be used to constrain the parameters of top - down models  @xcite .",
    "the photon searches may be used to assess parameters of astrophysical sources in the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin  @xcite cut - off scenario which predicts photons as ever present secondaries .",
    "if uhe photons are observed , they will be a supporting evidence for the gzk nature of the spectrum break at the highest energies observed by hires  @xcite , pierre auger observatory  @xcite and ta  @xcite .",
    "photon flux is sensitive to the mass composition of cosmic rays and hence may be used as a probe of the latter  @xcite .",
    "the results of the photon search also constrain parameters of lorentz invariance violation  @xcite .",
    "finally , photons with energies greater than @xmath7  ev could be responsible for cr events correlated with bl lac type objects on an angular scale significantly smaller than the expected deflection for protons in cosmic magnetic fields .",
    "this suggests neutral primaries  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a possible mechanism ) .",
    "since the ta detectors are composed of thin scintillators , they respond equally to the muon and electromagnetic components of the extensive air shower and are therefore sensitive to showers induced by photon primaries  ( see e.g.ref .",
    "@xcite for discussion ) .",
    "we use the shower front curvature as a composition - sensitive parameter ( c - observable ) and a modification of an event - by - event statistical method  @xcite to constrain the photon integral flux above the given energy . for the energy - sensitive parameter ( e - observable )",
    ", we use the scintillator signal density at 800 m core distance  @xmath8 .",
    "the comparison of an event - by - event statistical method with the `` photon median '' method  @xcite is presented .",
    "extensive air showers  ( eas ) induced by photon primaries differ significantly from hadron - induced events ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "photon induced showers contain fewer muons and have a deeper shower maximum when compared to hadronic showers .",
    "the latter results in the shower front having more curvature at the surface as illustrated in figure  [ fig : front ] . at the highest energies ,",
    "there are two competing effects responsible for the diversity of showers induced by photon primaries .",
    "first , the electromagnetic cross - section is suppressed at energies , @xmath9  ev due to the landau , pomeranchuk @xcite and migdal @xcite  ( lpm ) effect .",
    "the lpm effect delays the first interaction so that the shower arrives at ground level underdeveloped .",
    "the second effect is @xmath10 pair production which is due to photon interaction with the geomagnetic field above the atmosphere .",
    "secondary electrons produce gamma rays by synchrotron radiation generating a cascade in the geomagnetic field .",
    "the probability of photon conversion is a function of photon energy and the perpendicular component of geomagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the shower development therefore depends on both the zenith and azimuthal angles of the photon arrival direction .",
    "illustrative view of hadron- ( left ) and gamma - induced ( right ) showers .",
    "gamma - induced shower is deeper due to smaller cross - section of the first interaction .",
    "moreover , the hadronic cascade is secondary with respect to electromagnetic in photon - induced showers .",
    "the latter contains fewer muons ( shown in red ) and have larger curvature of the shower front . ]",
    "the event - by - event method  @xcite requires a set of simulated photon - induced showers for the analysis of each real shower .",
    "we simulate the library of these showers with different primary energies and arrival directions . for the highest energy candidates ( events which may be induced by a photon with primary energy greater than @xmath1ev ) we simulate individual sets of showers with fixed zenith and azimuthal angles . at these energies ,",
    "the shower development becomes azimuth - angle dependent due to the photon cascading in the geomagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "we use corsika  @xcite with egs4  @xcite to model the electromagnetic interactions and preshower code  @xcite for geomagnetic interactions .",
    "there is no significant dependence on the hadronic model because only photon - induced simulated showers are used in the method .",
    "the showers are simulated with thinning and the dethinning procedure is adopted  @xcite to simulate realistic shower fluctuations .",
    "the detector response is accounted for by using look - up tables generated by geant4  @xcite simulations .",
    "real - time array status and detector calibration information are used for each monte carlo  ( mc ) simulated event .",
    "the monte - carlo events are recorded in the same format as real events and analysis procedures are applied in the same way to both .",
    "the photon - induced mc set contains @xmath11 triggered events produced from 3380 corsika showers by randomizing core location  @xcite .",
    "we use the telescope array surface detector data set observed and recorded between 2008 - 05 - 11 and 2011 - 05 - 01 . during this time period , the surface detector array was collecting data with a duty cycle greater than 95%  @xcite .",
    "we reconstruct each event with a joint fit of the geometry and lateral distribution function ( ldf ) and determine the linsley curvature parameter `` @xmath12 '' ( see appendix  a for definition ) along with the arrival direction , core location , and signal density at 800 meters @xmath13 .",
    "as noted above , the same reconstruction procedure is applied to both data and monte - carlo events .    for each real event , `` @xmath14 ''",
    ", we estimate the energy of the hypothetical photon primary , @xmath15 , i.e. the average energy of the primary photon , inducing the shower with the same arrival direction and @xmath16 .",
    "the look - up table for @xmath17 is built using the photon mc set ; the dependence on azimuthal angle , @xmath18 , is relevant for events with @xmath19  ev where geomagnetic preshowering is substantial .",
    "photon - induced showers are naturally highly fluctuating .",
    "consequently , the accuracy of the determination of @xmath20 is about 50% at the one sigma level . in the present analysis , @xmath20 is used for event selection only and therefore its fluctuations are well accounted for in the exposure calculation .",
    "the effect of these fluctuations is `` lost '' photons  @xcite , i.e. the photons with reconstructed energy below the energy cut .",
    "this will be estimated in section  [ sec_exposure ] .",
    "we imposed the following requirements on both the data and mc events :    1 .",
    "the shower core is inside the array boundary with the distance to the boundary larger than 1200 m ; 2 .",
    "zenith angle cut : @xmath21 ; 3 .",
    "the number of scintillator detectors triggered is @xmath227 ; 4 .",
    "the joint fit quality cut , @xmath23d.o.f.@xmath24 ; 5 .",
    "@xmath16 cut : @xmath25ev or @xmath19  ev depending on the energy region discussed ( the second variant is used for both @xmath26 and @xmath27ev ) .",
    "the cuts determine a photon detection efficiency which is greater than 50% for showers induced by primary photons with energy above @xmath0ev .",
    "the calculation of exposure is given in section  [ sec_exposure ] .",
    "the resulting data set contains 877 events with @xmath28ev and @xmath21 which we used for our photon search .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      photon flux limits of the present work  ( ta ) compared to the previous limits by agasa  ( a )  @xcite , yakutsk  ( y )  @xcite and pierre auger observatory  ( pa )  @xcite . ]",
    "using the statistical method ( section  [ sec_method ] ) we arrive at the following results : @xmath29 @xmath30    these photon limits are shown along with the results of the other experiments in figure  [ fig : result ] .",
    "we obtain photon fraction limits by dividing the corresponding flux limits by the integral flux of the telescope array sd spectrum  @xcite : @xmath31    the limits strongly constrain the top - down models of the origin of cosmic rays , see  @xcite for discussion .",
    "next , we compare the results of the event - by - event method with the results of the simpler `` photon median '' method  @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the events having curvature greater than the median photon curvature are identified as photon candidates .",
    "this criteria corresponds to @xmath32 .",
    "we we observe three candidate events with energy greater than @xmath0  ev ( see figure  [ fig : c ] ) and no candidate events above @xmath1  ev .",
    "this corresponds to a 95% poisson confidence limit of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the flux limits are @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38 , @xmath1 and @xmath2  ev correspondingly . the limits using the two methods are in mutual agreement .    finally we discuss how the result depends on the assumption of the @xmath39 primary photon spectrum .",
    "we repeated the analysis with varied spectral index and for @xmath40  ev arrived at @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 primary spectra correspondingly .",
    "the limits for energy greater than @xmath1 and @xmath45ev are less sensitive to the spectral assumption .",
    "both the use of plastic scintillators sensitive to photon - induced showers and the application of event - by - event statistical method allowed us to put stringent limits on the flux of primary photons with energies in excess of @xmath0  ev with the data obtained during three years of the ta surface detector operation .",
    "the photons propagate without deflection by magnetic fields and therefore in the case of the few nearby sources we may not expect an isotropic flux .",
    "it worth mentioning that the limits of this paper are strongest among those obtained in the northern hemisphere .",
    "the result depends neither on the choice of hadronic interaction model , nor on possible systematics in the energy determination of hadronic primaries .",
