    "glassy systems are characterised by their dynamical properties : at their glass transitions , they fall out of equilibrium on experimental time - scales , and exhibit aging phenomena . as the glass transition is approached , their relaxation times increase in a super - arrhenius fashion and the decay of their equilibrium dynamical correlation functions is slower than exponential  @xcite . in the last fifteen years",
    ", several approaches have been developed to recover theoretically the experimental , out - of - equilibrium results ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most striking experimental features of a glass - forming liquid is that the increase in relaxation time near the glass transition does not seem to be accompanied by any significant changes in the liquid structure .",
    "however , experiments and computer simulations  @xcite both indicate that a _ dynamical _ length scale is growing as the glass transition is approached .",
    "that is , glassy materials are made up of active and inactive regions of space - time , namely _",
    "dynamical heterogeneities_. based upon these results , the idea that the glassy properties of a system arise directly from their dynamical heterogeneity was developed in @xcite , stimulating further theoretical understandings of glassy dynamics .",

    "while equilibrium statistical mechanics is concerned with fluctuations in the configuration space of the system , ruelle s formalism focuses on the trajectories ( histories ) by which the system evolves through configuration space .",
    "the method has been applied recently to kinetically constrained models of glass - formers  @xcite and to a lennard jones binary mixture  @xcite . both these studies distinguish _ active _ and _ inactive _ histories of the systems , according to the range of configuration space visited during the history . in the kinetically constrained models",
    ", it was proven that the active and inactive histories form distinct populations . in the language of the thermodynamic formalism",
    ", they are separated by a first - order phase transition in trajectory space . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was argued that the heterogeneous dynamics of those models is intrinsically linked to this transition .    in this article , we focus on a soft @xmath0-spin model with @xmath1 , whose static and dynamic properties can be studied analytically .",
    "the @xmath2 limit of the @xmath0-spin model , namely the disordered random energy model , was recently shown to possess a connection between the activity of the histories it follows and the dynamical heterogeneities in its glassy phase @xcite .",

    "we will find that the phase transitions in the models depend on the scaling of the eigenvalue density near these points , and hence that phase transitions in the @xmath33 ferromagnet and the @xmath1 spin glass are related to each other , and have the same scaling exponents .",

    "@xcite for the infinite - ranged ( mean - field ) ising model .",
    "the equilibrium critical point leads to a dynamical phase transition at @xmath57 below the critical temperature .",
    "however , instead of being first order as in the fully - connected model , the phase transition we have found is second order . unlike the fully - connected models , the ferromagnetic model of has several diverging length scales , although the presence of a diverging length scale throughout the ordered phase may be a peculiarity of our particular model . in any case , the diverging length scale as @xmath185 within the anomalous phase seems to be a new feature that merits further investigation .",
    "in particular , the existence of the anomalous phase seems to be linked to the existence of aging / coarsening solutions to the relaxational dynamics of these models .",
    "these solutions are characterised by @xmath210 as in the anomalous phase and exhibit a length scale that grows with the time that has elapsed since a quench from above @xmath96 .",
    "it can be readily shown that if multiple solutions to the equations of motion exist with different activity , then the field @xmath56 acts to select the solutions with the larger ( @xmath211 or smaller ( @xmath59 ) activity , leading to a transition at @xmath57 . however , while the aging dynamics of the @xmath1 spin - glass of can be solved  @xcite by a similar method to that of cugliandolo and dean  @xcite , we have not yet established any clear connection between these dynamics and the anomalous disordered phases discussed here .",
    "this too remains an area for future study .",
    "we also compare the results shown here with those obtained for kinetically constrained models  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "active and inactive phases coexist at the @xmath57 axis",
    ". however , there are two important differences .",
    "firstly , in the kinetically constrained models considered in  @xcite , the transition is first - order , signalling the coexistence of active and inactive solutions to the equations of motion .",
    "these have been interpreted as `` ergodic fluid '' and `` non - ergodic glass '' states  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the continuous transition in the soft spin models is second order : the anomalous phase is characterised by a diverging correlation length that we have tentatively attributed to the growing length scale associated with the aging behaviour of the system . taking the large - time limit of the aging solution ,",
    "the activity of the system approaches that of the ordered state : the active ( aging ) and inactive ( ordered ) phase are not separated by a gap in the activity , unlike the kinetically constrained models .",
    "secondly , we emphasise that in the kinetically constrained models , the @xmath57 axis of the phase diagram belongs to the active phase .",
    "introducing any @xmath58 leads immediately to an inactive phase that is qualitatively different from the unbiased state at @xmath57 . on the other hand , in the models considered here",
    ", the @xmath57 axis belongs to the inactive ( ordered phase ) : it is the introduction of any @xmath59 that leads to an active phase that differs from the unbiased steady state .",
    "finally we note that contrary to its @xmath212 counterparts , the thermodynamic properties of the @xmath1 spin glass have only a single transition temperature and do not display any kind of replica symmetry breaking . here",
    ", we have analysed this problem by diagonalising the quadratic dynamical action : a method that applies only for @xmath1 .",
    "however , the same results can be verified using the replica trick and integrating out the disorder .",
    "the application of such methods to models with @xmath12 would provide further insight into the behaviour of large deviations of the activity in ` glassy ' models .",
    "we thank juan garrahan for many helpful discussions .",
    "we also thank david chandler for his advice and encouragment in the early stages of this work , during which time rlj was supported by the office of naval research through grant no .",
    "n00014 - 07 - 1 - 068 .",
    "we are grateful for financial support from the franco - british alliance programme , managed by the british council and the french foreign affairs ministry ( mae ) .",
    "here , we show how the functional integral ( [ part ] ) can be cast in the form ( [ partfinal ] ) .",
    "we define @xmath213 which is proportional to the growth rate of the activity @xmath55 defined in , and the related quantity : @xmath214    both @xmath215 and @xmath216 are self - averaging quantities in the thermodynamic limit of large @xmath3 .",
    "it is therefore convenient to constrain these quantities with lagrange multipliers and then to integrate over these constrained quantities by a saddle - point method .",
    "writing the ( time - dependent ) lagrange multipliers as @xmath217 , eq .",

    "the integrals over @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 can be carried out through a saddle point approximation .",
    "we replace @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 by their saddle - point values @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath231 and @xmath231 . in particular , differentiating the action @xmath232 with respect to @xmath215 and @xmath216 , we arrive at @xmath233 thus , performing the saddle - point integrals in   leads to   in the main text .",
    "similarly , differentiating with respect to @xmath225 and @xmath234 leads to the self - consistency equations ( [ sus ] ) and ( [ susb ] ) .",
    "here we discuss the solutions of the self - consistency equations   and   for @xmath59 and @xmath115 . using the notation of sec .",
    "[ sec : anom ] , we can write the integrals of equs .   and   as @xmath235 since we are at @xmath157 and @xmath59 , we have @xmath236 .",
    "the small @xmath56 limit becomes the limit @xmath237 but if we take the limit for @xmath237 keeping @xmath238 we have @xmath239 , and the self - consistency condition can not be satisfied .",
    "we therefore take both @xmath173 and @xmath240 to zero together : we assume that @xmath241 which can be verified _ a posteriori _ through the solution to  .",
    "the result is @xmath242^{-2}$ ] , consistent with our assumptions .",
    "we start by splitting the integral in ( [ i1 in ] ) into three parts : @xmath243 in the limit of @xmath241 , the first integral has a divergent contribution @xmath244 . in the second and third parts we can take the limit @xmath237 directly in the integrand . if we then take the limit of small @xmath173 then we find that the second integral vanishes as @xmath245 while the third approaches unity",
    ". thus we arrive at  .",
    "we now evaluate the @xmath246 limit of the expression ( [ i2 in ] ) .",
    "we use a similar method , spliting the integral into two terms : @xmath247 in the first integral we introduce @xmath248 and @xmath249 , thus arriving at @xmath250 the leading behaviour of this quantity can be evaluated by setting directly @xmath251 into the integral , so that this contribution to @xmath252 is @xmath253 $ ] .    for the second integral in eq .",
    "( [ split ] ) , we have @xmath254 so we expand the integrand in powers of @xmath255 .",
    "the leading term vanishes and the second term is @xmath256 .",
    "writing @xmath257 , this term is smaller first term in   which is @xmath258 .",
