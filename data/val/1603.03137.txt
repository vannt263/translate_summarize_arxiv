    "observation of the accelerated expansion of the universe , measurement of the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature anisotropies and the observation of the light elements produced during the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) epitomize the current status of the precision cosmology .",
    "especially the bbn is an ideal tool not only to test aspects of the standard models of cosmology as well as of nuclear and particle physics but also to look for new physics beyond those standard models .",
    "( for recent reviews of bbn see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular new calculations of the light - element abundances",
    "are performed @xcite using the recent high - precision 2015 _ planck _ measurement of the baryon - to - photon ratio , helium abundance and the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom , @xmath5 @xcite , as well as astronomical observations of deuterium @xcite .",
    "these calculations find that d / h observations are now more precise than the corresponding theoretical predictions , but predictions for @xmath0 nuclei continue to disagree with observations . a recent update ( nacre ii ) of the compilation of charged -",
    "particle - induced thermonuclear reaction rates for nuclei with mass number @xmath6 @xcite was used in the calculations of refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these calculations also provide confidence limits for the production of @xmath7li , @xmath8be , @xmath9b , and carbon , oxygen , and nitrogen ( cno ) . a precise value of the cno / h is not only important for population iii star formation , but as we elaborate in this paper , may also affect the abundances of @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold .",
    "one is to explore the plasma effects in the bbn more completely .",
    "it was already demonstrated that non - relativistic screening of the coulomb interaction in nuclear reactions taking place during the bbn epoch does not produce a noticeable impact on light element abundances @xcite .",
    "however , the screening effects due to the relativistic electron - positron plasma was not included in the analysis of ref .",
    "it was recently shown that electron - positron plasma screening is crucial for neutrino interactions in the bbn epoch @xcite . in the current work",
    "we include the effects of the screening due to the electron - positron plasma in nuclear reactions during the bbn epoch .",
    "a second purpose is to explore the ramifications of the possible presence of resonances in relatively unexplored reactions involving @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "for a low - density plasma at t@xmath101 to 2 mev , non - relativistic screening can be neglected as the associated debye length is @xmath11 fm ( see appendix ) @xcite .",
    "for example , for @xmath12 , and temperature of 1 mev , one gets @xmath13 fm and the salpeter correction to the reaction rate @xmath14 .",
    "however , for an electron - positron plasma , as would exist in the bbn epoch , the temperature is of the same order as the electron mass , requiring the relativistic expression ( given in the eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) of appendix ) . for a vanishing chemical potential ,",
    "this debye length as a function of temperature is shown in figure [ debye_zeromu ] . at higher temperatures , this is much smaller than the debye length which was determined for screening by non - relativistic electrons alone .    the debye length for a relativistic electron plasma as a function of temperature at @xmath15 . ]    using this debye length , we used a bbn nuclear reaction network to determine the change in mass fractions based on the screening enhancement factor .",

    "mass fractions @xmath17 were determined using a network with unscreened rates .",
    "these are compared to mass fractions @xmath18 from a network employing rates from reactions screened by a relativistic electron plasma . the change in mass fraction :",
    "@xmath19 is shown in figure [ delx_zero ] . at early times in the network ,",
    "the temperature is higher , and the consumption of protons , deuterium , and helium proceeds at a higher rate for the screened reactions compared to the unscreened case .",
    "the overall net destruction of these lighter elements is higher in the screened case .",
    "while there is an overall reduction in some of the heavier elements , the relative change for those is extremely small .",

    "relative change in mass fractions for nuclei in the bbn network as a function of time . ]",
    "inclusion of a non - zero chemical potential in equation [ a3 ] will increase the inverse screening length and thus decrease the debye length , thus increasing the reaction rate enhancement factor .    for a non - zero chemical potential , equation [ a3 ]",
    "was solved numerically .",
    "the debye length , @xmath20 , for various chemical potentials , @xmath21 , as a function of temperature is shown in figure [ debye_nonzero ] .",
    "a somewhat large chemical potential is necessary for a reduction in the debye length by one order of magnitude , and this occurs only at low temperature . at higher temperatures , the electron kinetic energy dominates over the chemical potential , and the effect of @xmath21 is reduced .",
    "debye length as a function of temperature in an electron plasma for non - zero chemical potential for various chemical potentials . ]    the resulting enhancement factor , @xmath22 , is shown in figure [ f_mu ] for @xmath23 . from this figure",
    ", one sees that for zero chemical potential the enhancement factor changes more rapidly at low temperature than at high temperature .",
    "as the temperature approaches the value of the electron mass , the enhancement factor increases less rapidly .",
    "one also sees that the enhancement factor as a function of @xmath21 changes much less at higher temperatures than at lower temperatures .",
    "reaction rate enhancement factor as a function of the electron chemical potential for temperatures @xmath24 through @xmath25 mev with @xmath23 . ]",
    "it is customary to relate the chemical potential to the electron degeneracy parameter : @xmath26 assuming a constant degeneracy parameter , then the chemical potential is much lower at lower t , reducing the effect of @xmath21 at lower t. this is shown in figure [ enhancement_zeta ] .",

    "the relative reduction of @xmath1be was mapped .",
    "the mapping of the relative mass fraction of @xmath1be , r , is defined to be the final @xmath1be mass fraction for a bbn calculation with a @xmath4c resonance divided by that with no resonance : @xmath54",
    "prior to examining resonances in the @xmath1be+@xmath2he reaction , we proceed with a discussion of the effects of relativistic electron screening on the same reaction .",
    "while a resonance in @xmath4c may increase the destruction of @xmath1be , the effect may be magnified by the inclusion of screening from the electron plasma .",
    "the enhancement on the cross section is described in the appendix .",
    "incorporating screening into the usual thermonuclear reaction rate ( trr ) will create an energy shift @xmath55 of the reaction system because of the reduced particle potential .",
    "the energy shift @xmath55 is defined in the appendix .",

    "the values of @xmath60e as a function of temperature are shown in figure [ shift_v_t ] ; the trend is nearly linear except at low temperature .",
    "its effect on non - resonant trrs is also expected to be small , particularly as the cross - section is negligible near @xmath61 .",

    "the high temperature limit is as given in equation [ high_t ] .",
    "the inset shows the shifts at low temperature . ]",
    "another possible effect of this shift is the influence on sub - threshold resonances .",
    "a shift to higher energy can result in a much more significant decrease in the cross - section and total reaction rate as less of the sub - threshold resonance is integrated over . using this shift , a possible reduction in the trr for low - lying resonances",
    "is investigated .",
    "the result may be significant because the energy shift results in less of the resonance tail being included in the trr . from figure [ shift_v_t ] ,",
    "one expects the enhancement to be small , approximately 1% , and to scale with temperature .",
    "this scaling is because as the temperature decreases the debye screening length increases , resulting in a reduced energy shift , which approaches zero .",
    "this is important to note as the effect is most pronounced only at high temperatures ( early in bbn ) and in regions where a significant portion of the resonance may be removed from the reaction rate - near the threshold .",
    "this may be advantageous as there may be a slight reduction in bbn reaction rates during the early stages , resulting in a slower progression to the @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "the effect of this shift is shown in figure [ res_int ] which shows a resonance ( @xmath65 = 110 kev , @xmath52 mev ) in the @xmath1be @xmath66he reaction times the boltzmann distribution for six values of @xmath67 .",
    "this quantity is the integrand of equation [ a9 ] . for this quantity ,",
    "the particle energy is dictated by the boltzmann distribution while the value of the cross section is determined by the energy shift ( to higher energy ) , effectively shifting the cross - section to lower energy in the particle distribution .",
    "we note , of course , that the lowest resonances in this figure have been eliminated by experiment , but they are shown here to indicate the relative strengths of the resonance tails and to emphasize the point that the actual resonance peaks are not important as the penetrability in the entrance channel at the lowest energies reduces the cross - section to negligible values .    for all resonances shown , the shift to higher energy shifts the entire integrand towards the high - energy tail of the resonance . for the low - lying resonances , @xmath68 kev , the integral",
    "is increased slightly as the tail of the integrand is emphasized . for a higher - energy resonance , @xmath69 kev ,",
    "only a very small portion of the lower energy tail is cut out of the integration , as most of the low - energy tail is dominated by the entrance channel penetrability .",
    "the integrand of the reaction rate for a narrow resonance for three values of the resonance energies for the bare potential ( dotted lines ) and the screened potential ( solid lines ) . for the low - lying resonances",
    ", the resonance at 0.1 mev corresponds to the upper - most set of lines , while the resonance at -0.05 mev corresponds to the lowest set of lines . ]    the enhancement for non - resonant rates is exemplified in figure [ non_res_enh ] for @xmath70 and @xmath58 . as expected , the enhancement is small and always greater than unity at non - zero temperature since the cross - section is always monotonically increasing with energy and a small shift to positive energy results in a larger cross section integrated into the reaction rate .",
    "it was found that this enhancement varies little with resonance energy and width .",
    "this makes sense considering the integrand of the reaction rate and the very small energy shift @xmath71 . in any case , essentially the entire cross - section is integrated over , but it is effectively shifted to a higher energy in the maxwell - bolzmann distribution by an amount @xmath71 . for a very small shift , the ratio of rates in figure [ non_res_enh ] is roughly : @xmath72 which is the salpeter factor .",
    "ratio of screened to bare trr for the non - resonant component of the trr only . ]      in the previous section , the exact integration of equation [ a9 ] was used to determine the correction to reaction rates for the relativistic electron gas .",
    "the typical prescription is to use the salpeter approximation to determine the width corrections .",
    "this approximation results from the separation of the exponent containing the debye length from the integration over energy and use as an independent coefficient in the reaction rate without shifting the cross section energy .",
    "this correction can be evaluated by considering the change in reaction rates using the exact screening due to the coulomb potential in the yukawa form compared with the salpeter approximation .",
    "this evaluation is shown in figure [ salpeter_compare ] where we plot the quantity @xmath73 in figure [ salpeter_compare ] , we take @xmath74 = 110 kev , @xmath75 = 2 kev corresponding to @xmath76 500 kev , and the difference between the ratio in equation ( [ zz ] ) and unity is multiplied by 10@xmath77 .",
    "it can be seen that the relative difference between the correction in figure [ salpeter_compare ] and the salpeter correction factor is on the order of 10@xmath78 .",
    "the small energy shifts from electron screening induce a difference ratio nearly equal to the salpeter correction factor to within @xmath79% , though it does appear that the difference gets larger at lower temperatures and lower resonance energies as more of the resonance falls below the reaction threshold for the energy shifts induced by screening .",
    "the correction to the reaction rate from the energy shifts as studied in this work divided by the salpeter correction factor for several resonance energies , indicated in the figure . ]      trrs for this reaction are shown in figure [ e_dep_wid_rates ] for several resonances . for these resonances ,",
    "we assume a total @xmath4c decay width @xmath80 kev , a spin degeneracy factor @xmath81 , and a single particle width @xmath51 .",
    "the thermonuclear rates are shown only for the resonances and must be added to the non - resonant rate , also shown in the figure .",
    "we observe that the results in figure [ e_dep_wid_rates ] decrease with the decay width . for decay widths",
    "@xmath82 50 kev , the resonant rates are less than the non - resonant rate .",
    "it is seen that the rates are similar for all the resonances in this temperature range .",
    "several factors must be considered .",
    "first , for the energy - dependent widths , a lower resonance may have a larger particle population in the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , but the entrance channel widths are also smaller . very roughly , the rate is proportional to the penetrability factor times the maxwell - boltzmann factor .",
    "while the penetrability factor increases with energy , the maxwell - boltzmann factor decreases .",
    "thermonuclear reaction rates for the @xmath1be(@xmath2he,@xmath3)@xmath4c reaction for several resonances for possible particle - decay channels in the @xmath4c compound nucleus .",
    "the dashed black line is the non - resonant trr .",
    "assumptions are described in the text . ]    from the figure [ e_dep_wid_rates ] one can conclude that resonances in the energy range of 0@xmath83e@xmath831 mev and with @xmath84 kev for the @xmath1be+@xmath2he reaction are insufficient for reducing the bbn production of @xmath1be .",
    "this is consistent with prior results @xcite , and the additional inclusion of relativistic plasma screening effects have also been found to be negligible .",
    "thus , the validity of the previous analysis is maintained .",
    "a possible bbn scenario with a higher density at lower temperatures may result in such a situation , though one must gauge the effects of the density increase on other reactions as well .",
    "in this work we explored in detail the consequences of the screening due to the relativistic electron - positron plasma on non - resonant and possible resonances on the secondary reactions destroying @xmath0 nuclei during the big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "we found that effects of screening from the relativistic plasma are small even for the reaction with the largest @xmath85 , namely @xmath2he+@xmath1be .",
    "we note that this reaction remains to be the least experimentally explored one in the network of bbn reactions .",
    "we scanned through possible resonance parameters ( widths and resonance energies ) in our calculations .",
    "the very small entrance channel widths in any possible resonance renders its effects quite small .",
    "bbn reactions would have to overcome this either by resonances to high spin states - which is very unlikely , resonances via neutron captures to destroy a=7 nuclei - which are inhibited by an insufficient neutron abundance by the time a=7 nuclei are produced , or via resonances to energy states high above threshold . as the temperature by the time a=7 nuclei are produced in significant abundance is low ( @xmath86 1 ) , this last case is also not highly probable .    even though the effects we find are small , it still is worthwhile to demonstrate how robust our current understanding of the bbn is to effects not previously considered .",
    "this is especially important since the instruments scheduled to go online in the future , such as the thirty meter telescope @xcite , will measure the abundances of the light elements resulting from the bbn with greater precision . 0.2 in    maf and abb would like to thank the members of of the national astronomical observatory of japan for their hospitality .",

    "<S> we explore effects of the screening due to the relativistic electron - positron plasma and presence of resonances in the secondary reactions leading to @xmath0 nuclei during the big bang nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we investigate and examine possible low - lying resonances in the @xmath1be(@xmath2he , @xmath3)@xmath4c reaction and examine the resultant destruction of @xmath1be for various resonance locations and strengths . while a resonance in the @xmath4c compound nucleus is thought to have negligible effects we explore the possibility of an enhancement from plasma screening that may adjust the final @xmath1be abundance . </S>",
    "<S> we find the effects of relativistic screening and possible low - lying resonances to be relatively small in the standard early universe models . </S>"
