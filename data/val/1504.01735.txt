    "stellar mass functions are important for population studies , both nearby and at high redshift .",
    "mass functions are not static but change their shape when the frequencies of stars or their masses are altered over time @xcite .",
    "possible causes include the evaporation of stars and mass segregation in star clusters and mass loss in the course of stellar evolution .",
    "these mechanisms leave characteristic fingerprints in mass functions from which insights into the evolutionary status of stellar populations and the mechanisms themselves can be gained .",
    "massive stars are subject to strong stellar wind mass loss , which decreases their masses already on the main sequence ( ms ) , directly affecting mass functions .",
    "furthermore , it emerges that binary stars play an important role in stellar populations of various ages and even dominate the evolution of massive stars @xcite .",
    "the multiplicity fraction , i.e.  the number of multiple stars divided by the total number of stellar systems , is larger for higher masses : it exceeds 40% for solar like stars ( f , g and k stars ) and 70% for the most massive stars ( o - stars ) . in close binaries , mass is exchanged between the binary components during roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) or in stellar mergers , directly affecting stellar masses and hence the mass function . the mass gainers are rejuvenated and can appear much younger than they really are .",
    "some mass gainers may also be visible as blue straggler stars .",
    "the determination of stellar ages is a fundamental task in stellar astrophysics that can be biased by rejuvenated binary products .",
    "various methods are used to determine stellar ages .",
    "the surface properties of individual stars can be compared with evolutionary model predictions , e.g. , luminosity , surface temperature or surface gravity , rotation rates in low mass stars @xcite or surface nitrogen abundances in massive stars . in star clusters ,",
    "the most widely used age determination method compares the main sequence turn - off with theoretical isochrones .",
    "close binary evolution such as mass transfer and stellar mergers leads to spurious or inaccurate results in all of these methods . to derive unambiguous age estimates one must be able to distinguish between rejuvenated binary products and genuinely single stars .    in this paper",
    "we investigate how the modulation of stellar mass functions by single and binary star evolution can be used both to identify binary products and to derive unambiguous stellar ages .",
    "more generally , we explore what can be learned about stellar evolution and the evolutionary status of whole stellar populations from observed mass functions .",
    "we also investigate quantitatively how single and binary star evolution influence the determination of initial mass functions . to that end , we perform detailed population synthesis calculations of coeval stellar populations using a rapid binary evolution code .",
    "we describe our method in sec .",

    "we characterise their binary fraction and ages , and compare their predicted frequencies to those found in galactic open star clusters in sec .",

    "we compute the evolution of single and close , interacting binary stars and construct , at predefined ages , mass functions by counting how many stars of certain masses exist .",
    "this approach ensures that we factor in all the relevant single and binary star physics to investigate their influence on the present - day mass function ( pdmf ) .",
    "the initial parameter space of binaries is large compared to that of single stars , which essentially consists of the initial mass . in binaries , there are two masses , the orbital separation , the eccentricity of the orbit and the relative orientation of the spin axis of both stars .",
    "we apply some standard simplifications to reduce this huge parameter space : we impose circular orbits and that both stellar spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "all our models are calculated for a metallicity @xmath2 ( unless stated otherwise ) .",
    "furthermore we focus on the main sequence because stars spend typically @xmath3 of their life in this evolutionary stage .",
    "still , we need to follow the evolution of a large number of stellar systems to sample the remaining binary parameter space and to resolve effects at the high mass end of the pdmf .",
    "hence , we work with a rapid binary evolution code .",
    "we use the binary population and nucleosynthesis code of with modifications due to @xcite which is based on the rapid binary evolution code of @xcite .",
    "this code uses analytic formulae @xcite fitted to detailed single star evolutionary models @xcite to approximate the evolution of single stars for a wide range of masses and metallicities",
    ".    the fitting formulae of @xcite are based on detailed stellar model sequences of stars with mass up to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of stars with mass in excess of @xmath4 is thus based on extrapolations of the original fitting formulae .",
    "the ms lifetime , @xmath5 , is particularly inaccurately extrapolated by the appropriate fit , so we replace it with a logarithmic tabular interpolation of the ms lifetimes taken directly from the models of @xcite in the mass range @xmath6 .",
    "more massive than this we extrapolate the final two masses in the grid of detailed models @xcite .",
    "this results in a reduction of the ms lifetime of e.g. a @xmath7 star at @xmath2 from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , i.e.  in a reduction of @xmath10 , which is in agreement with state - of - the - art non - rotating detailed stellar models of and .",
    "stellar wind mass loss for stars with luminosities @xmath11 is given by .",
    "this recipe is modified by a factor @xmath12 according to to mimic the impact of the metallicity @xmath13 on wind mass loss rates .",
    "binary stars can exchange mass either by rlof , wind mass transfer or merging .",
    "rlof occurs when one star ( hereafter the donor ) fills its roche lobe and transfers mass to its companion ( hereafter the accretor ) through the inner lagrangian point .",
    "depending on the physical state of the donor star one distinguishes between case a , b and c mass transfer . following the definition of @xcite , case",
    "a mass transfer occurs during core hydrogen burning , case b after the end of core hydrogen burning and case c , defined by , after the end of core helium burning .",
    "our binary evolution code differs from @xcite in its treatment of rlof . for stable mass transfer",
    "it is expected that the stellar radius @xmath14 adjusts itself to the roche lobe radius @xmath15 , i.e.  @xmath16 . whenever rlof occurs ( @xmath17 ) we remove as much mass as needed to shrink the donor star back into its roche lobe . the resulting mass transfer and mass accretion rates",
    "are capped by the thermal timescales of the donor and accretor , respectively .",
    "we follow @xcite to determine the occurrence of common envelope evolution and contact phases that lead to stellar mergers .",
    "ms mergers are expected either if the initial orbital separation is so small that both stars fill their roche lobes and thus come into physical contact or if the mass ratio of the accretor to the donor star falls below a certain limit at the onset of mass transfer , @xmath18 , which drives the accretor out of thermal equilibrium and hence results in a contact system .",
    "the critical mass ratio is approximately @xmath19 for ms stars , @xmath20 if the donor star is a hertzsprung gap star and is given by a fitting formula if the donor star has a deep convective envelope @xcite .",
    "mass transfer because of either stable rlof or during a stellar merger makes the mass gainers appear younger than they really are .",
    "such rejuvenated stars may stand out as blue stragglers in hertzsprung  russell ( hr ) diagrams .",
    "rejuvenation is handled following @xcite and @xcite but with improvements as described in and @xcite .",
    "the apparent age @xmath21 of a star is given by the amount of burnt fuel compared to the total available .",
    "for a star with ms lifetime @xmath22 we therefore have ( in a linear approximation ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mass ratio of the burnt to totally available fuel .",
    "after mass transfer onto a ms star with a convective core , the mass of the already burnt fuel is given by the fraction of burnt material , @xmath25 , times the convective core mass before mass transfer , @xmath26 ( primes indicate quantities after mass transfer ) .",
    "after mass transfer , the convective core and hence the available fuel of the accretor grow in mass , i.e.  @xmath27 , because the total stellar mass increases ( and vice versa for the donor star ) .",
    "thus , the fraction of burnt fuel after mass transfer is @xmath28 and the apparent age , @xmath29 , is @xmath30 this equation holds for the accretor and also for the donor when setting @xmath31 ( no burnt fuel is mixed out of the core upon mass loss from the stellar surface ) and shows that the accreting stars rejuvenate upon mass transfer ( @xmath32 because @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) while the donor stars age ( @xmath35 because @xmath36 ) . the accretor and donor will have burnt less ( more ) fuel than a single star of the same mass that did not accrete ( lose ) mass . if stars do not have convective cores , e.g. , stars with initial masses in the range @xmath37 or hertzsprung gap stars which have radiative cores , we set @xmath31 because no fresh fuel is expected to be mixed into their cores .    to model the rejuvenation of ms mergers we follow @xcite : first",
    ", we assume that a fraction @xmath38 of the total mass @xmath39 is lost during the merger ; we adopt @xmath40 .",
    "second , we approximate the core mass fraction @xmath41 of ms stars according to fitting functions and estimate the apparent age @xmath42 of the newly formed merged star from , @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the effective ages , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the core mass fractions of the progenitor stars and @xmath5 denotes the ms lifetime of the corresponding star .",
    "the denominator contains the effective core mass fraction @xmath48 of the merger product which is given by its core mass fraction modified by an additional mixing of @xmath49 of the hydrogen - rich envelope .",
    "the resulting rejuvenation is less than in the original @xcite code , where it is assumed that the whole star is mixed , and closer to that seen in hydrodynamic and smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of stellar mergers .",
    "we set up a grid of stellar systems to cover the parameter space of single and binary stars and assign each stellar system @xmath50 a probability of existence @xmath51 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath51 are calculated from @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a distribution function of the initial masses and the initial orbital periods and @xmath54 is the volume of the parameter space filled by the stellar system @xmath50 .",

    "stellar masses @xmath62 are given in solar masses .",
    "single stars and also the primaries of binary stars , i.e.  the initially more massive component , are distributed according to a salpeter imf @xcite .",

    "a complete picture is yet lacking ( e.g. , for ms primary stars in the mass range @xmath69@xmath70 ) but it seems that a flat mass ratio distribution , @xmath71 is reasonable maybe except at the lowest primary masses ( @xmath72 ) . we adopt this as the distribution function of the initial mass ratios , meaning that all mass ratios @xmath73 are equally probable ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "we adopt a minimum mass ratio , @xmath75 .    in terms of orbital separations , we are only interested in close binaries , i.e.  binaries that can interact by mass exchange at some point during their life .",

    "the magnitude of the accumulation depends on the imf slope @xmath157 and on the strength of stellar winds , i.e.  on the wind mass loss prescription and the metallicity .",
    "our wind mass loss prescription for ms stars tends to slightly underestimate stellar wind mass loss compared to .",
    "we compare our initial and end - of - ms stellar masses to the latest non - rotating stellar models of and and find that the turn - off masses agree within @xmath89@xmath254 for stars less massive than about @xmath4 and that we overestimate the turn - off masses by up to @xmath309 for more massive stars .",
    "this deviation is primarily because of the wolf ",
    "rayet wind mass loss rates used in and for massive ms stars which we only apply for post - ms stars .",
    "increasing the wind mass loss for stars @xmath310 to match the turn - off masses of the latest detailed stellar models results into stronger peaks at the high mass end of pdmf younger than about @xmath311 .",
    "older populations are not affected .",
    "the wind mass loss peak flattens pdmfs ( sec .",
    "[ sec : quantifying - evol - effects ] ) . whether this effect needs to be taken into account when deriving the imf from observations depends on how mass functions are constructed from a measured sample of stars .",
    "if , on the one hand , measured stellar luminosities are converted to masses by means of a suitable ml relation , the flattening of the pdmf by wind mass loss needs to be taken into account .",
    "if , on the other hand , the observed stars are compared individually to stellar evolution tracks to find their initial masses , this effect does not need to be corrected for because stellar tracks usually include wind mass loss .",
    "alternatively , the mass function slope can be determined omitting the high mass end and therefore the wind mass loss peak .      in this section",
    "we discuss changes in the treatment of binary interactions and their importance for the pdmfs . besides mass ,",
    "angular momentum is transferred during rlof . found that a uniformly rotating star needs to accrete only 510% of its initial mass through a disc to reach a critical ( keplerian ) velocity at the equator such that the outermost layers are no longer bound to the star .",
    "this point of view is debated and there are several arguments regarding accretion and decretion disks which might be able to dissipate angular momentum such that stars stay always below critical rotation and thus can accrete much more mass .",
    "if a star is spun up to over - critical rotation it probably sheds as much mass as is needed to rotate below critical .",
    "mass is lost from the system and takes away angular momentum from the star . in the case of rlof",
    "this means that not all transferred mass is accreted , mass transfer is non - conservative and typically only a few percent of the transferred mass is accreted .",
    "low mass transfer efficiencies reduce the pdmf binary tail . for stellar mergers",
    "we assume that @xmath312 of the system mass is lost and takes away the excess angular momentum .",
    "this is likely rather an upper limit because detailed collision simulations of massive ms stars show that @xmath313 is lost even in equal - mass merger events @xcite .",
    "detailed binary models find mass transfer efficiencies of about @xmath260 for case  a and of the order of @xmath314@xmath260 for early case  b mass transfer .",
    "also , tides in short period binaries and magnetic fields in combination with mass loss ( e.g. , by a stellar wind ) , i.e.  magnetic braking , are efficient in dissipating angular momentum such that stars do not reach critical rotation during rlof .",
    "magnetic fields seem to be even generated by strong shear because of mass accretion ( see e.g. , plaskett s star , @xcite ) and stellar mergers .",
    "it is mentioned by @xcite that the critical mass ratio @xmath315 that determines whether stars come into contact during thermal timescale mass transfer , e.g. , when the primary star is a hertzsprung gap star , is rather approximate .",
    "case  b mass transfer can lead to a contact phase for extreme mass ratios because the mass transfer timescale becomes faster than the thermal timescale of the accretor .",
    "we implement a similar criterion with the consequence that nearly all binary systems undergoing case  b mass transfer go through a contact phase in which both stars merge or eject their common envelopes . merging stars results in a post - ms object and hence a reduction of ms secondary stars .",
    "ejecting envelopes terminates any mass transfer such that the initial secondary stars can not accrete any matter  in other words the mass transfer efficiency is @xmath316 for most case  b binaries .",
    "the resulting changes to our pdmfs are small , because we already limit mass accretion to the thermal timescale of the accretors .",
    "the initial distribution functions of secondary masses ( or mass ratios ) and orbital periods are also important for our results .",
    "we assume an initially flat mass ratio distribution , i.e.  all mass ratios are equally probable .",
    "small initial mass ratios often lead to contact phases ( see the discussion of the binary parameter space in sec .  [",
    "sec : binary - parameter - space ] ) .",
    "a distribution function of initial mass ratios which favours equal mass binaries enhances the effect of mass transfer and reduces the effect of ms coalescence . also the case  b contribution , which is the dominant mass transfer channel at later times ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mt - cases ] ) , is increased because the case  b mass transfer efficiency is higher for larger mass ratios .",
    "if the initial orbital separation distribution favours small initial orbital separations compared to pik s law , case  a and  b mass transfer ( including stellar mergers ) occur more frequently which increases the magnitude of the tail of the pdmfs .",
    "different imf slopes @xmath157 enhance or reduce the importance of binary physics .",
    "binary evolution usually increases the mass of stars : let this increase be given by a multiplicative factor @xmath317 , i.e.  the increased mass is @xmath318 .",
    "if we increase all stellar masses @xmath116 by the same factor @xmath317 , we enhance the mass function at the increased mass @xmath318 by the factor , @xmath319 the steeper the slope of the imf , i.e.  the more negative @xmath157 , the bigger the effect of any mass gain",
    ". also the flattening of the pdmf because of unresolved binaries is more important for steeper imf slopes and less important for flatter imf slopes ( sec .",
    "[ sec : quantifying - evol - effects ] ) .",
    "this trend is opposite if mass is lost e.g. , by stellar winds : then , a flatter imf enhances and a steeper one reduces the accumulation of stars .",
    "binaries in photometric studies are usually unresolved which leads to an overestimation of their masses ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : mobs ] ) . a mass function , even at zero age ,",
    "thus looks different compared to the imf .",
    "we find changes in the slope of the mass function of the order of @xmath320 toward flattened mass functions for zero age populations .",
    "the flattening because of unresolved binaries is more important for larger masses because of the mass dependence of the power law index of the ml relation ( sec .  [",
    "sec : quantifying - evol - effects ] ) .",
    "the problem of unresolved binaries is well known . to compare with their results",
    "it is important to know how they distributed stars in binaries .",
    ", for example , do not use a flat mass ratio distribution , but they draw both binary components randomly from one imf . for an initial imf slope of @xmath321 (",
    "our initial imf slope is salpeter , i.e.  @xmath64 ) and a binary fraction of 50% they derive a pdmf slope of @xmath322 ; for a binary fraction of 100% they arrive at @xmath323 .",
    "these changes occur according to their analysis in a mass range of @xmath126@xmath324 and are larger than we find .",
    "the major difference between their calculation and ours is the assumed distribution function of stars in binaries ( mass ratios and imf slope ) .",
    "@xcite not only investigates unresolved binary stars but also higher order multiples and chance superpositions in dense clusters . taking only the effect of binary stars into account",
    "they conclude `` that for most cases the existence of unresolved binaries has only a small effect on the massive - star imf slope '' of the order of @xmath325 .",
    "they use the same mass ratio distribution as in our analysis but slightly different imf slopes .",
    "@xcite investigate the effect of unresolved binaries and higher order multiples for different pairing methods .",
    "none of their pairing methods correspond to our flat mass ratio distribution . a steepening of the observed pdmf by @xmath326 is reported .",
    "their pdmf is steeper because they take a certain number of stars given by their imf and pair them randomly into binaries ( their rp method ) .",
    "the probability of finding a massive star grouped with another massive star is therefore less than to find it grouped with a lower mass companion , hence estimated system masses do not change significantly for massive stars . at lower masses",
    "it is opposite : relatively more binaries with stars of similar masses are found and the companions lead to higher system mass estimates . in total",
    "this leads to a steepening of the pdmf .",
    "all in all it seems that unresolved binaries have limited influence on the pdmf of zero age populations .",
    "pairing stars which are randomly sampled from an imf steepens the mass function , whereas a flat mass ratio distribution flattens the mass function as is shown in our analysis .",
    "observations of massive , i.e.  o - type binaries favour a flat mass ratio distribution @xcite , so the high mass end of pdmfs of young stellar populations with o - type stars is expected to be flattened if binaries are unresolved .",
    "the statement that the most massive stars are likely blue stragglers has to be treated with caution , because it is only valid in `` rich '' ( i.e.  massive ) clusters where there are enough stars to sample the binary parameter space well  this problem is known as stochastic sampling .",
    "binary evolution e.g. , re - populates the @xmath293 pdmf on average by more than @xmath282 of the imf above @xmath218 ( @xmath327 ) .",
    "if there is initially only one star in this mass range , we expect about @xmath328 stars to be re - populated by binary evolution  if there are initially 10 stars ( if the cluster is a factor of 10 more massive ) , we expect to find about four binary products .",
    "so if the cluster is not massive enough , there might be no blue straggler star at a certain age .",
    "it will also take some time until binary star evolution produces the first blue straggler stars .",
    "this again depends on the cluster richness and on how binaries are distributed : the shorter the initial period , the earlier the binary interaction .",
    "when the initially most massive stars in a cluster evolve toward the end of core hydrogen burning we know that blue stragglers can be produced by ms mergers and case  a mass transfer .",
    "so the whole contribution of ms mergers and case  a mass transfer products of binaries with initial @xmath7 primary stars to the blue straggler star population is expected to be present after about @xmath0 .",
    "blue stragglers can be even present at younger ages  this is just a matter of stochastic sampling which is investigated in more detail in @xcite ."
