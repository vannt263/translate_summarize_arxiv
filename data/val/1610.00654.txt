    "in the early 1960s gell - mann and levy @xcite , based on the works of schwinger @xcite and polkinghorne @xcite , constructed a renormalizable field theory for the new scalar mesons @xmath2 with null isotopic spin , being this theory called the sigma model .",
    "these authors considered the possibility of modifying the sigma model by supposing it as a composite of the pion field rather than an elementary one describing a new particle .",
    "this was the arising of the nonlinear sigma model ( nl@xmath3 m ) , which featured an @xmath4 symmetry initially .",
    "later , the model was endowed with an @xmath1 symmetry , the @xmath1 nl@xmath2",
    "m @xcite , started to gain special attention and was widely applied to study different aspects of field theory and condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 nl@xmath2 m is also interesting because it provides topological solitons whose equations are exactly integrable in the bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) limit @xcite .",
    "the solutions of these bps equations describe a map from a spherical surface that represents the two - dimensional physical space to a spherical surface in the internal field space , being classified according to the second homotopy group @xmath5 . this model , however , has a serious inconvenience because the solutions are scale invariant preventing one from describing localized particles zakrzewski .",
    "a way for breaking the scale invariance is gauging the @xmath6 subgroup and providing a spontaneous symmetry breaking potential .",
    "such mechanism was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a maxwell term controlling the gauge field dynamics was introduced , so that topological solitons with arbitrary magnetic flux were engendered .",
    "a similar mechanism was implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite with the abelian chern - simons in the gauge sector , implying topological and nontopological solitons .",
    "these two approaches produce topological solitons which are infinitely degenerate in a given topological sector .",
    "such degenerescence was circumvented in refs .",
    "mukherjee1,mukherjee2 by means of the introduction of a self - interacting potential possessing a symmetry breaking minima .",
    "this potential induces a new topology in which the infinite circle of physical space is mapped on the equatorial circle of the internal space so that the solitons are now classified by the first homotopy group @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath1 sigma model has also been analyzed with the gauge field dynamics ruled by both the maxwell and chern - simons terms @xcite . in the same context , but with a nonminimally coupled gauge field , charged bps soliton solutions were found @xcite , revealing a magnetic flux quantized only for topological solitons .",
    "investigation of topological defects in different theoretical contexts has been a sensitive matter in the latest years . among the new frameworks",
    "are the @xmath0- and lorentz - violating ( lv ) field theories .",
    "the violation of the @xmath0 and lorentz symmetries is a theoretical possibility that has been extensively investigated since 1996 , mainly in the framework of the standard model extension ( sme ) @xcite , with several repercussions @xcite . in lv theories ,",
    "the formation of defects was considered in many situations , for example , in solitons generated by scalar fields @xcite , general defects modified by tensor fields seifert , abelian monopoles @xcite and oscillons @xcite .",

    "more specifically , we have modified the dynamics of the maxwell sector with the @xmath0-odd carroll - field - jackiw term @xcite , whereas a @xmath0-even lv term was included in the @xmath1 sigma sector .",
    "the suitable projection of this lagrangian in ( 1 + 2)-dimensions yields a model similar to maxwell - chern - simons gauged @xmath1 sigma model ( mcs@xmath2 m ) including lv terms in the scalar sigma sector .",
    "next , we have implemented the bps formalism and written the self - dual equations describing the self - dual configurations of this @xmath0-odd and lv model . to assess the repercussion of the lv terms on the self - dual configurations of the gauged @xmath1 sigma model",

    "these solutions possess finite energy proportional to the topological charge .",
    "the lv model provides some interesting limits connecting different versions of the gauge @xmath1 sigma model .",
    "the profiles are obtained numerically and compared with the ones in the total absence of lorentz - violation in order to highlight the lv effects .",
