    "<S> starforming factories in galaxies produce compact clusters and loose associations of young massive stars . fast radiation - driven winds and supernovae input their huge kinetic power into the interstellar medium in the form of highly supersonic and superalfvenic outflows . apart from gas heating , collisionless relaxation of fast plasma outflows results in fluctuating magnetic fields and energetic particles . </S>",
