    "this also gives a possible scenario for a wide @xmath73 plateau due to interactions .",
    "for large @xmath74 and @xmath43 , we expect the ground state to have pairs of holes and singlets mostly on rungs so that the system has a large spin gap , which gives a @xmath75 plateau .",
    "however , the @xmath43 plateau is much smaller than the half - filling spin gap because polarized spins in fact gain kinetic energy if they are localized next to holes so that it is easier to create them . as the magnetic field",

    "when all of them are fully polarized , we enter the @xmath53 plateau because the next spin excitation one can do is to flip a singlet on a rung , which cost is approximately @xmath74 .",

    "further brings quickly the system into a plateau phase with unpaired holes .",
    "while the magnetization curve is similar to the non - interacting one below the @xmath53 plateau , its width is clearly controlled by @xmath82 rather than by @xmath54 .",
    "an interesting feature on the pairing of holes in the @xmath42 plateau is the occurrence of a transition when @xmath79 is increased from 0 to @xmath74 from a state with unpaired holes to paired holes ( see  [ fig : transition ] ) .",

    "finally , no @xmath154 cdw are expected under magnetic field .",
    "secondly , the @xmath194 cdw order parameter@xcite is @xmath195 and has an exponent @xmath196 at zero magnetization .",
    "this order parameter contains terms such as @xmath197}\\ ] ] which have a `` @xmath194 '' wave vector @xmath198 and , for nonzero magnetization , an exponent @xmath199 .",
    "we also have terms like @xmath200}\\ ] ] with a wave - vector @xmath201 and an exponent @xmath196 which is not affected by the magnetic field .",
    "this last term can compete with the superconducting order parameter to be the most diverging fluctuations depending on @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us consider the regime of small interchain hopping and assume that now the intra - chain terms are such that @xmath205 . in this case , the dominant term becomes the josephson coupling@xcite and the perturbation term eq .",
    "( [ eq : exchange - rewritten ] ) is replaced by :    @xmath206.\\ ] ]    the treatment parallels the one of the exchange coupling in sec .",
    "[ sec : dominant - exchange ] .",
    "the josephson term is rewritten in the form : @xmath207.\\ ] ] the scaling dimensions of the term @xmath208 is @xmath209 and scaling dimensions of the term @xmath210 is @xmath211 . a similar rg analysis to the one of sec .",
    "[ sec : dominant - exchange ] yields for @xmath212 @xmath213 ( mod @xmath87 ) and @xmath214 ( mod @xmath87 ) and for @xmath212 @xmath215 ( mod @xmath87 ) and @xmath216 ( mod @xmath87 ) .",
    "this time , interchain correlations are decaying exponentially , and the dominant superconducting correlations are the intrachain ones . since @xmath212 , @xmath217 and",
    "the intrachain @xmath168 triplet superconductivity is dominant . for @xmath218",
    "the dominant superconducting correlations are the intrachain singlet and intrachain triplet @xmath14 .",
    "the results are summarized in the table  [ tab : coupled - chains ] where the critical exponents @xmath219 are defined by @xmath220 .",
    "we note that triplet @xmath168 superconducting correlations can never coexist with singlet superconducting correlations .",
    "we have tried to observe these predictions numerically but using both the t - j model with small @xmath221 and hubbard model with small @xmath51 .",
    "unfortunately , for large @xmath222 , the system with open boundary conditions has edge effects due to the proximity of the phase separation which occurs generically in the t - j model for large @xmath223 .",
    "when edge effects are absent and in the hubbard model , we did not find evidences of the proposed predictions , i.e. we mostly found cases related to the coupled bands regime fixed point .",
    "still , contrary to the isotropic case which has been widely studied numerically at zero magnetization , a systematic study of the phase diagram at zero magnetization would be necessary before tackling the system under magnetic field .",
    "this systematic study is out of the scope of the present article .",
    "in conclusion , we studied the case of two fermionic coupled chains , or ladders , under a magnetic field inducing a zeeman effect in the system .",
    "the first situation we addressed was the free and strong - coupling limits .",
    "we found that large doping - dependent magnetization plateaus occur for `` coupled - dimers '' systems ( with large interactions on the rungs ) and that pairing is not expected in the @xmath53 magnetization plateau phase .",
    "for a system with isotropic couplings , we showed that @xmath53 plateaus also exist and but pairing survives to much higher magnetizations .",
    "furthermore , the computation of the one and two - particles gap and bosonization interpretation proved that the plateau phase is metallic while the system is in a superconducting state below and above this plateau .",
    "in addition , we computed the superconducting upper critical field which is much larger than the pauli limit for a wide range of the parameters of the t - j model .",
    "superconducting correlation functions precisely agree with the bosonization predictions up to the accuracy of our methods . turning to the coupled - chain regime , other interesting unconventional behaviors",
    "are predicted for the superconducting correlations with , for instance , the possibility of having polarized triplet correlations under high magnetic fields .",
    "however , quick numerical investigations study were not able to find good parameters providing evidences of such predictions",
    ".    _ discussion on experiments _  we now briefly discuss consequences for experiments .",
    "first of all , the possibility of measuring irrational magnetization plateau would give a direct access to the hole doping @xmath32 which has recently been estimated@xcite to be @xmath224 in the superconducting phase of doped ladders .",
    "however , the magnetization is a global measurement including the contribution of all subsystems .",
    "for instance , the magnetization curve of scco has very recently been measured@xcite showing that the main contribution comes from the chains subsystem . on the other hand , measurements such as nmr under high magnetic field",
    "can provide local information on each subsystem .",
    "the superconducting critical field @xmath225 of scco has been measured under high pressure@xcite and displays a strong anisotropy and an anomalous @xmath225 curvature .",
    "furthermore , @xmath225 much larger than standard pauli limit are found , suggesting an exceeding of the latest .",
    "the nature of the superconductivity in scco is a long - standing debate because of its complex structure and the requirement of high pressure experiments .",
    "questions such as the nature of the pairing or the dimensionality of superconductivity have not reached full agreement yet .",
    "one possibility is that superconducting fluctuations of the rvb type develops in the ladder subsystem leading to true superconducting order once these ladders are coupled through josephson coupling ( @xmath6 being controlled by this coupling rather than by the magnetic energy scale @xmath226 ) . in this case",
    "our study suggests that the fflo mechanism is relevant at the ladder subsystem level and thus could be stabilized when coupling the ladders .",
    "the other possibility would be that the superconducting phase is really two - dimensional@xcite , allowing other explanations of the exceeding of pauli limit such as triplet pairing@xcite _ when = 0_. nmr measurements@xcite also showed that superconductivity survives under rather high field and @xmath227wave superconductivity was suggested .",
    "note that our study also proposes the possibility for the emergence at high fields of pairing channels not present at @xmath228 since magnetic fluctuations from which pairing originates are strongly affected by the magnetic field .",
    "lastly , we mention that anomalous curvature of @xmath225 as found in experiments were predicted in the mean - field approach of fflo states in quasi - one and two - dimensional @xmath7-wave superconductors@xcite .",
