    "the experimental effort to directly detect the space  time ripples known as gravitational waves has been going on for 35 years , beginning with weber s pioneering work in the early 1960s @xcite . since then , two main experimental approaches have evolved : cryogenic resonant  mass detectors @xcite and laser interferometers @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of both techniques is sufficient that unambiguous detection of gravitational waves is expected soon , perhaps within the next ten years .",
    "the work of taylor and hulse @xcite , showing the orbital decay of binary pulsar psr  1913 - 16 is in agreement with general relativity s prediction for gravitational wave emission , has added to the anticipation of the first direct , confirmed detection .",
    "it appears possible that a new generation of advanced resonant  mass detectors could operate concurrently with interferometers already under construction . at this time , understanding possible sources of gravitational waves and which experimental technique is best suited to which source of radiation takes on greater importance .",
    "we endeavor to clarify this by numerically computing energy signal  to  noise ratios for resonant  mass detectors and interferometers interacting with two possible sources of gravitational waves .",
    "the best understood source of detectable gravitational waves is from inspiraling and coalescing binary neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the laser interferometer gravitational  wave observatory ( ligo ) has been designed and optimized to detect these events at a distance of 200 mpc after significant interferometer improvements @xcite . to accomplish this , it has been devised to be most sensitive at as low a frequency as possible ( @xmath0 hz ) where the waveform from binary neutron stars is stronger .",
    "however , the waveform at 200 hz is due almost solely to the _ inspiral _ phase of the binary neutron star evolution and contains virtually no information about the _ coalescence_.",
    "as the inspiral is determined by point - mass dynamics , the equation of state for nuclear matter ( i.e. , neutron stars ) will affect only the coalescence waveform .",
    "coalescence also occurs when the gravitational field between the neutron stars is strongest , so the effects of general relativity will be more important than during the inspiral . to measure these effects",
    ", it will be necessary to monitor the _ higher  frequency _ waves from coalescence in addition to those at lower frequency from inspiral .",
    "resonant - mass gravitational wave detectors have been in use for longer than the interferometric detectors . resonant ",
    "mass antennas with bar geometries have been taking data and been continually improved since their inception .",
    "the use of spherical geometry as an improvement over bars was first suggested by forward in 1971 @xcite , and wagoner and paik later showed that at equal frequencies spheres have an advantage over bars in energy cross section @xcite .",
    "recent re - examination of spherical detectors @xcite has generated international interest in constructing one or more massive spherical antennas incorporating advances in transducer technology .",
    "the possibility of building such an antenna to operate concurrently with the first ligo interferometers appears good @xcite .",
    "the sensitive frequencies for a sphere are higher than those for the first ligo interferometers , spanning about 750  hz to 2700  hz in the lowest mode , and therefore they are well suited to complement interferometer experiments at high frequencies .",
    "one such advanced resonant  mass detector can be more sensitive than the first ligo interferometers within a bandwidth of around 100  hz centered at the quadrupole resonance of the sphere and would have a sensitivity within that band comparable to what will be achieved by the advanced ligo interferometers .",
    "the sphere s sensitivity is independent of source direction , unlike ligo .",
    "spherical antennas can also provide direction and polarization information more easily than ligo @xcite and , properly instrumented , could detect any scalar gravitational radiation that might be present @xcite . in this paper , when we refer to `` high  frequency '' gravitational radiation , we mean those signals that include significant strength above 750  hz .",
    "this frequency is where the first ligo interferometers sensitivity begins to weaken from photon shot noise in the lasers @xcite and the spherical resonant  mass detector s sensitivity becomes important .",
    "we have looked at the question of whether a spherical detector , or in particular a truncated icosahedral gravitational - wave antenna ( tiga ) as described by merkowitz and johnson @xcite , is capable of observing high  frequency events .",
    "specifically , the coalescence of a binary neutron star system and the dynamical bar  mode instability of a single , rapidly rotating star were examined as possible astronomical phenomenon that could produce high  frequency gravitational radiation .",
    "waveforms for these events , generated with computer simulations by centrella s group at drexel university , were used as input into a mathematical model of a 50  mk spherical detector with three  mode inductive transducers @xcite .",
    "the energy signal - to - noise ratios obtained from this model help determine how tigas and interferometer experiments can best complement one another .",
    "coccia and fafone @xcite have also looked at energy signal  to  noise ratios from astronomical events in spherical detectors .",
    "our work and theirs are complementary .",
    "they looked solely at inspiraling binary neutron stars as sources , leaving out the coalescence phase as well as any other high  frequency events .",
    "since the inspiral can be modeled accurately by point ",
    "mass dynamics , they used an analytical expression for the waveform .",
    "we found it necessary to use numerical data from computer models to simulate the coalescence . by limiting themselves to the inspiral phase ,",
    "coccia and fafone were unable to accurately predict energy signal  to  noise ratios for higher mass neutron stars or black holes .",
    "for some sphere sizes and compositions their simulation does not produce results for 1.4 m@xmath1 neutron stars , the observed mass for all known neutron stars in binaries @xcite",
    ". however , their method was able to show that spherical antennas can determine the chirp mass ( @xmath2 @xcite ) , the orbital inclination and the distance to the source , a result our method did not produce . both techniques",
    "provide useful information that are unobtainable by the other .    in section  [ method ] ,",
    "we describe the method used for the energy signal - to - noise ratio calculations , how the code that produced the results was written , and what parameters for the spherical antenna we used . in section  [ results",
    "] , we discuss the signal waveforms we used as inputs into the model developed in section  [ method ] and present the results of the calculations .",
    "finally , in section  [ con ] , we present our conclusions and discuss ideas for further work .",
    "to calculate the energy signal  to  noise ratio ( snr ) per unit bandwidth of the tiga , we followed the method of price @xcite who showed how to calculate the snr for a bar antenna that uses an optimal filter to process the data .",
    "stevenson @xcite has shown that for six identical transducers in the tiga geometry and identical qs for all five quadrupole modes of the sphere , the snr of a spherical antenna is identical to that of a bar antenna instrumented with one of those six transducers .",
    "the _ equivalent bar _ has an effective mass as seen by the transducer of    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the sphere radius and density .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath6 comes from the radial driving point admittance matrix of the sphere at the quadrupole frequency . for an aluminum sphere with a poisson ratio of  0.33 , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the factor of 5/6 in eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) accounts for the multiple sphere modes and transducers @xcite .",
    "the snr for the tiga is the same as that for the equivalent bar provided one equates the energies deposited by the gravitational wave in the two antennas .",
    "we can now calculate the snr for the simpler case of a bar , while retaining all the information available from a sphere .",
    "the energy deposited in the sphere is calculated from @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the energy cross section of the sphere @xcite , @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the extensional sound speed of the sphere material , @xmath12 is the quadrupole frequency , and @xmath13 is a dimensionless constant that accounts for antenna geometry and mode .",
    "it has the value 0.215 @xcite for a sphere in the lowest quadrupole mode and 0.585 in the first excited quadrupole mode @xcite . throughout @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "are newton s gravitational constant and the speed of light .",

    "domain amplitude of the gravitational wave .",
    "thus the total energy deposited in the equivalent bar is    @xmath20    we define an _ effective force _ that acts on the equivalent bar @xcite :    @xmath21    where the relationship between @xmath22 and @xmath4 is determined as follows . for an impulsive force ,",

    "( [ feff ] ) as the definition of a force on the equivalent bar , the method of price can be followed exactly .",
    "the transducer we assumed was a three  mode inductive transducer .",
    "a three  mode transducer is necessary , rather than the standard two  mode system , to get higher bandwidths , which are required to reach sensitivities near the standard quantum limit .",
    "higher bandwidth reduces the requirement on the q of the sphere and transducer .",
    "higher bandwidth is also useful to cover a larger spectrum of frequencies and reduce the need for additional antennas .    assuming that a template of the gravitational waveform is available , optimal filtering can be used on the output signal of the transducer .",
    "the optimal filter produces the highest snr possible @xcite and has the form    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the velocity signal of the antenna effective mass and @xmath31 is the total velocity noise spectral density , both referred to the input of the optimal filter .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is the time at which the snr is to be optimized . to calculate @xmath30 and @xmath31 ,",
    "it is necessary to solve the equations of motion for the antenna coupled to the three  mode resonant transducer .",

    "this assumption gives a sphere diameter of about 1.05  m. the remaining sphere sizes were chosen to give reasonably continuous coverage of the frequency band 750  hz to 2700  hz .",

    "the initial orbit was chosen to be nearly circular and it evolves due to newtonian gravity with a frictional term added to simulate the energy loss to gravitational wave emission . when the stars spiral together , tidal distortions in each star s shape grow larger and the evolution approaches coalescence .",

    "such a strong signal would be detectable even at the virgo cluster distance .",
    "however , it seems likely that the starting frequency for the dedekind evolution will be well below the spherical detector s band unless the star is initially spinning just below the dynamical instability limit and is nearly incompressible . in order for the starting frequency of this event to exceed the 795  hz frequency of the 3.25  m sphere , lai and shapiro s fig .",

    "in contrast , the frequency span of the signal from jacobi  like evolution seems to have a higher possibility of overlap with the band covered by the spheres ; however , the chief uncertainty for that signal is whether or not the dynamical instability produces a spinning bar rather than a spheroid . _",
    "if _ jacobi - like evolution occurs and its starting frequency is below 800  hz , then the signal computed by lai and shapiro is a very strong source for a big sphere : we calculate an energy snr of @xmath131 for a 3.25  m diameter sphere and an energy snr of @xmath132 for the first ligo interferometers from a waveform averaged over all angles and a source distance of 1  mpc .",
    "the results in table  [ bns0 ] for the spherical antenna tuned to the lowest quadrupole frequency interacting with gravitational radiation from binary neutron stars shows that spherical antennas operate at a level that is complementary with the first ligo interferometers .",
    "the largest sphere obtains an energy snr of 11.3 at a distance of 15 mpc .",
    "if a snr of 10 in this detector is a sufficient threshold for a three  way coincidence experiment , then a source with angle averaged strength could be detected out to a distance of 15.9 mpc . with",
    "the most optimistic estimate of the coalescence rate , 3 events per year out to 23 mpc @xcite , the expected rate of detection @xmath133 is @xmath134 the factor of 1.15 is due to statistical preference for angles that give high snrs ( see @xcite for details ) . for detection of gravitational radiation from binary neutron stars at a distance of 15 mpc , a 3.25  m diameter aluminum sphere near the standard quantum limit will be sufficient .",
    "the upper limit on the event rate at this distance is about 1 coalescence per year @xcite .",
    "table  [ bns0 ] also shows that a large sphere instrumented at the lowest quadrupole frequency does not hold out much hope of seeing the details of binary neutron star coalescence .",
    "even the 1.05  m diameter sphere , whose size was chosen so that the lowest quadrupole mode was at the maximum of the coalescence wave spectrum , does not manage to reach a snr of 1 .",
    "as the frequency of the sphere goes up , the radius , and with it its mass , goes down . at frequencies where the waveform from zhuge _ et al . _",
    "is strong , the energy cross section of the sphere is too small to detect much .",
    "this raises the question of the reliability of the numerical waveform , especially of the frequency @xmath135 associated with the barlike transient .",
    "according to centrella @xcite , the qualitative shape of the waveform is fairly reliable , but the exact position of this peak and other structures may change as numerical relativity techniques improve . if @xmath135 were to be found at a lower frequency , closer to the lowest quadrupole mode of one of the larger spheres , the prospect for a snr greater than 1 for the coalescence phase might improve .    the data in table  [ bns1 ] for spheres sensitive at the first excited quadrupole mode to inspiraling and coalescing binary neutron stars appears a little more promising for the detection of coalescence .",
    "the largest sphere still has the highest overall snr , but it is reduced from its value in the ground state .",
    "the 2.00  m diameter sphere , with an excited quadrupole frequency of 2483  hz , is now the sphere tuned to @xmath135 .",
    "it does not quite manage a snr of 1 either , but it does have a higher snr for the coalescence than for the inspiral phase , as do the 1.70  m and 1.45  m spheres .",
    "the data in tables  [ bns0 ] and [ bns1 ] , taken together , suggest that a xylophone of spheres acting collectively and in collaboration with ligo may be the best approach to detection of binary neutron star coalescence .",
    "the smaller spheres do not contribute much to the xylophone snr , so four spheres , from 3.25  m to 2.00  m in diameter , would be enough to give most of the xylophone benefits . if these four spheres could be instrumented at both the ground and the first excited quadrupole frequencies , a fairly wide spectrum , from 750  hz to 2700  hz continuously , could be monitored .",
    "the spheres could rely on ligo to provide a high snr detection of the inspiral .",
    "once the event is discovered , the spheres would have the less strenuous task of identifying and analyzing the high frequency coalescence .",
    "thus , even the modest snrs found in our work may still prove useful in gathering astrophysical data on coalescing binary neutron stars .",
    "the data for the rapidly rotating star shown in table  [ rrs ] is more encouraging . for the ground state modes , the 1.45  m sphere has its frequency near the peak of the spectrum and obtains a strong snr of almost 10 .",
    "the two spheres with quadrupole frequencies below the resonance of the 1.45 m sphere also have strong snrs , about 7 and 5 . further away from the peak ,",
    "snrs fall off rapidly , especially on the high  frequency end .",
    "the snr goes from 0.935 for a sphere diameter of 1.25  m to well below 1 for a diameter of 1.05  m. thus with only two antennas the peak signal can be easily found , provided their sensitive frequencies occur at the appropriate positions .",
    "the first excited state data is similar to the ground state , showing strong snrs when the sphere s quadrupole frequency is at or near the 1765  hz peak . in the excited mode , however , this occurs between the 3.25  m and the 2.75  m diameter spheres . with larger masses ,",
    "these spheres have higher energy cross sections and thus obtain much higher snrs .",
    "a snr of 25 , from the 2.75  m sphere in the excited state , represents such a strong signal that the source position on the sky could be located to within almost 0.13  steradian @xcite . as with the ground state data ,",
    "there is a sharp drop in snr to effectively zero about 500  hz above the peak frequency , making location of the peak frequency possible .",
    "the rapidly rotating star waveform was generated by assuming a total mass of 1.4 m@xmath1 and a centrifugal hangup at 20  km .",
    "the location of the peak frequency , which is twice the rotation frequency of the star , is very sensitive to the values of these parameters",
    ". it can be as low as 1  hz for a 1.0 m@xmath1 , 3000  km star up to 6000  hz for a 2.0 m@xmath1 , 10  km star @xcite . since the appropriate values for these star parameters",
    "are not known , and in fact are values we could hope to determine from gravitational wave data , actual signals from this source could potentially be outside the sensitive range of spherical antennas . a peak frequency above about 2500  hz",
    ", corresponding to a 1.4 m@xmath1 , 10  km star , would be extremely difficult to detect outside our galaxy .",
    "this would limit the number of events to a few per century . detecting these higher frequency signals",
    "depends on the accuracy of the current template , especially the secondary peak in fig .",
    "[ fftrrs ] at 400  hz .",
    "many details of the rapidly rotating star s evolution are not well understood and this waveform may undergo substantial changes as the field of numerical relativity advances .    a xylophone of a 3.25  m , a 2.75  m , a 2.35  m and a 2.00  m diameter sphere instrumented at both the ground state and the first excited quadrupole state working along with ligo , as suggested for the inspiraling and coalescing binary neutron stars , would do an effective job of searching for rapidly rotating star events .",
    "for favorable mass and radius parameters , the excited state of the 2.75  m diameter sphere would be sensitive , with a snr threshold of 10 , out to 1.6  mpc .",
    "this will be sufficient to observe one event every decade , provided nearly all type i@xmath136 and type ii supernovae are sources of this event @xcite .",
    "this xylophone would also determine the star s rotation frequency , as a large snr would be seen in the more massive sphere and effectively nothing would be seen in the smaller .",
    "this would locate the peak frequency , and hence the rotation frequency , to within a few hundred hertz .",
    "negative results from such a xylophone would restrict the parameter space , providing data about neutron star development and equation of state .",
    "the xylophone covers a frequency range corresponding to hangup radii between 45  km down to 15  km .",
    "the broadband interferometers have difficulty detecting this dynamical instability , but do have a high snr for the secular instability .",
    "since these two gravitational wave events may occur in succession , a collaborative effort between spheres and interferometers would prove effective as with the binary neutron stars .    in this paper ,",
    "we have compared broadband interferometers with resonant  mass antennas for detection of high frequency gravitational radiation .",
    "another possible technique for detecting high frequency events involves dual  recycled interferometers @xcite .",
    "this approach allows laser interferometers to become much more sensitive within a narrow bandwidth at the expense of sensitivity elsewhere .",
    "krolak , lobo , and meers @xcite have looked at snrs for inspiraling neutron stars interacting with recycled interferometers using a simplified strain spectrum and an analytical formula for the waveform .",
    "their results for the unrecycled ligo are in close agreement with ours .",
    "further investigations of snrs comparing spherical antennas with dual  recycled interferometers is being done at caltech @xcite .",
    "in addition to the astronomical sources of gravitational radiation that we investigated here , there may be other high frequency signals potentially detectable in detectors optimized for the 12 khz band .",
    "events that might produce high  frequency gravitational waves include coalescence of a neutron star with a black hole or a black hole with a second black hole @xcite , asymmetric core collapse and bounce in supernovae @xcite , spinning neutron stars @xcite , and cosmic string vibrations @xcite . especially promising may be the black hole coalescences and spinning neutron stars .",
    "excitation of the high  frequency ( f  @xmath137  hz @xmath138 @xcite ) black hole quasi  normal modes would give a relatively strong signal at kilohertz frequencies .",
    "a gravitational  wave antenna detection of this radiation could provide the observational `` smoking gun '' to confirm the existence of black holes .",
    "experimental evidence of gravitational radiation from black hole coalescence would undoubtedly also provide great insight into relativistic gravity . spinning neutron stars are a periodic source that could radiate strongly for months @xcite .",
    "the frequency of the waves would be twice the rotation period , often above a kilohertz , and details of the wave would tell much about the structure of neutron stars . according to thorne @xcite , ``",
    "the deepest searches for these nearly periodic waves will be performed by narrow  band detectors ... e.g. , dual recycled interferometers or resonant  mass antennas . ''",
    "we call on the numerical relativity community to continue to develop reliable waveforms for all possible high  frequency events .",

    "( [ alpha ] ) .          as",
    "price @xcite explains , @xmath144 has the following physical interpretation : it is the spectrum of the energy which would be dissipated in @xmath57 if the signal were applied when the amplifier had been replaced by its input impedance plus an additional mechanical impedance equal to @xmath145 . if @xmath146 varies little over the band where @xmath144 is large , then the signal is approximately an impulsive force which deposits the energy      initially all in antenna motion . since the hypothetical detector with @xmath145 inserted",
    "is assumed lossless except for @xmath57 , eventually 100% of the energy @xmath23 ends up being dissipated in @xmath57 .",
    "thus from this physical argument we have          provided @xmath42 and @xmath56 vary little over the frequencies where @xmath150 is significant .",
    "hence , for an impulsive force , @xmath151 in the lossless case independent of the other detector parameters .    next , consider the case where all qs are infinite except that for the antenna .",
    "then the antenna dissipation produces a thermal force noise acting on @xmath34 with spectral density @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ sigma ] ) becomes          motivated by eq .",
    "( 26 ) in price @xcite , we use eqs .",
    "( [ en1],[en2 ] ) to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ newsig ] ) in terms of @xmath144 , and then expand the integral for snr to first order in @xmath156 and use eq .",

    "thus when all other qs are infinite , the asymptotic form of @xmath74 for large @xmath159 is described by @xmath160 @xmath161 when other qs besides @xmath159 are also finite , analysis along the lines above is more cumbersome , but one finds @xmath162 where the constants @xmath80 can be determined numerically .",

    "price @xcite argues that a clever choice of the masses and springs to maximize @xmath79 for a given value of @xmath57 is the optimal design strategy , and that a design in which @xmath144 is made `` optimally flat '' is nearly optimal in this sense .",
    "however , in this paper , we have chosen the simpler design originally proposed by richard @xcite which has constant successive mass ratios since we find both designs give similar values for @xmath154 .",
    "the values of @xmath80 for @xmath164 depend on the masses and springs chosen for the detector design .",
    "the values for @xmath165 and @xmath166 that we calculated and used are shown in table  [ alphatable ] .",

    "this ratio was chosen as a convenient value that gives a final transducer mass slightly higher than the mass that gives the lowest @xmath154 .",

    "<S> the gravitational radiation data used was generated by three  dimensional numerical computer models of inspiraling and coalescing binary neutron stars and of the dynamical bar  mode instability of a rapidly rotating star . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated energy signal  to  noise ratios for aluminum spheres of different sizes cooled to 50  mk . </S>",
    "<S> we find that by using technology that could be available in the next several years , spherical antennas can detect coalescing binaries out to slightly over 15 mpc , the lower limit on the distance required for one event per year . for the rapidly rotating star , </S>",
    "<S> we find , for a particular choice of the radius at centrifugal hangup , spheres are sensitive out to about 2 mpc . </S>",
    "<S> the event rate is estimated to be about 1 every 10 years at this distance .    </S>"
