    "the encryption / decryption strategy relates the projection of the covert information to the host _ pdf _ s .",
    "this feature permits the statistical encryption / decryption strategy to possess immense qualitative flexibility , and , provide enhanced security to the covert information , as compared to a _ pdf _ independent model [ 8 ] .",
    "the _ pdf _ dependent model , presented herein , sometimes demonstrates an increased rms error of reconstruction for decreased values of the condition number of the constraint operator @xmath37 .",
    "this seemingly counter - intuitive result is adequately explained with the aid of the rms error of encryption .",
    "the rms error of encryption is demonstrated to be a viable and relevant metric to assess the sensitivity of @xmath155 to perturbations @xmath94 .",
    "the statistical encryption / decryption strategy is platform independent , and the process of recovery of the covert information is accomplished with a very high degree of precision .",
    "the small amounts of data being transmitted through the covert channel as a consequence of the transmission of the cryptographic keys @xmath241 and the _ hierarchy indices _ @xmath242 s ( see section 3.2 ) , augers well for a coupling between the statistical encryption / decryption model , and a quantum key distribution protocol [ 13 , 14 ] .",
    "a study extending the present work , by describing the statistical encryption / decryption strategy within the framework of a fisher - schrdinger model , has been recently completed .",
    "herein , the fisher information has been employed as the measure of uncertainty .",
    "the host _ pdf _ s satisfy a time independent schrdinger - like equation ( tisle ) with an empirical _ pseudo - potential _ , that approximates a time independent schrdinger equation ( tise ) physical potential [ 7 , 15 ] .",
    "the tisle inherits the _ energy states _ of the tise , within an information theoretic context .",
    "the encryption of covert information is tantamount to projection of the code into different _ energy states _ of the tisle .",
    "the _ hierarchy indices _ in the present paper are replaced by the tisle _ energy states_.",
    "the fisher - schrdinger model provides a quantum mechanical connotation to the statistical encryption / decryption strategy .",
    "coupling the fisher - schrdinger model with a quantum key distribution protocol holds forth the prospect of achieving a self - consistent _ hybrid _ statistical / quantum mechanical cryptosystem .",
    "this work will be shortly presented for publication .",
    "ongoing work is directed towards a two - pronged objective .",
    "first , the projection of the covert information into @xmath155 has been provided with an information theoretic basis .",
    "next , models to extend the work presented in this paper to the case of steganography and information hiding have been developed .    by definition , steganography involves hiding data inside other ( host ) data . in steganography ,",
    "the covert information is concealed in a manner such that no one apart from the intended recipient knows of the existence of the message .",
    "this is in contrast to cryptography , where the existence of the message is obvious , but the meaning is obscured .",
    "the extension of the statistical encryption / decryption model presented in this paper to steganography involves encrypting image data into a _",
    "cover image_. in this case , the average pixel intensities of the _ cover image _ constitute the incomplete constraints .",
