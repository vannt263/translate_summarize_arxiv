    "information theoretic security was first introduced by shannon in @xcite , which studied the problem of transmitting confidential information in a communication system in the presence of an eavesdropper with unbounded computational power . since then",
    ", an extensive body of work has been devoted to studying this problem for different network models by deriving fundamental transmission rate limits @xcite and designing low - complexity schemes to approach these limits in practice @xcite .",
    "secure communication using multiple antennas was extensively studied as well , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "these works investigated efficient signaling mechanisms using the spatial degrees of freedom provided by multiple antennas to limit an eavesdropper s ability to decode information .",
    "the underlying information theoretic problem , the multi - antenna wiretap channel , was studied and the associated secrecy capacity was identified .",
    "we note that these works assumed that the eavesdropper s channel state information is available either completely or partially , although such an assumption may not be justified in practice .    as a more pessimistic but stronger assumption , references @xcite study secrecy capacity when the eavesdropper channel is arbitrarily varying and its channel states are known to the eavesdropper only .",
    "reference @xcite studies the single - user gaussian multi - input - multi - output ( mimo ) wiretap channel and characterizes the secrecy degrees of freedom ( s.d.o.f . ) . the same paper extended the single user analysis to the two user gaussian mimo multiple access ( mimo - mac ) channel .",
    "this was possible only when all the legitimate terminals have equal number of antennas , leaving the mimo - mac with arbitrary number of antennas at the terminals an open problem .",
    "our main contribution is to fully characterize the s.d.o.f .",
    "region of the two - transmitter mimo mac channel when the eavesdropper channel is arbitrarily varying .",
    "we show that the s.d.o.f .",
    "region can be achieved by a scheme that orthogonalizes the transmit signals of the two users at the intended receiver .",
    "moreover , it suffices to use a single - user wiretap channel code  @xcite and no coordination between the users is necessary except for synchronization and sharing the transmit dimensions . to establish the optimality of this scheme , our converse proof decomposes the mimo mac channel into a set of parallel and independent channels using the generalized singular value decomposition ( gsvd ) .",
    "a set of eavesdroppers , each monitoring a subset of links , is selected using an induction procedure and the resulting secrecy constraints are combined to obtain an upper bound on a weighted sum - rate expression .",
    "the outer bound matches the achievable rate in terms of the s.d.o.f .",
    "region , thus settling the open problem raised in @xcite for the case of two transmitters .",
    "interestingly , the s.d.o.f .",
    "region remains open for this model when the eavesdropper channel is perfectly known to all terminals .",
    "a significant body of literature already exists on this problem , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "if the channel model has real inputs and outputs , gaussian signaling is in general suboptimal and user cooperating strategies as well as signal alignment techniques are necessary  @xcite . in  @xcite it",
    "is established that s.d.o.f .  of @xmath0",
    "is achievable using real interference alignment for almost all configurations of channel gains .",
    "if the channel model has complex inputs and outputs , it is shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.16 ) that in general s.d.o.f .  of @xmath0 is achievable using asymmetric gaussian signaling .",
    "in contrast , the best known upper bound on the s.d.o.f . of individual rates",
    "is @xmath1 for both cases , established in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the proof of the theorem is divided into two parts .",
    "first , we establish the result for the case of parallel channels in section  [ sec : parallel ] .",
    "subsequently , in section  [ sec : generalmimo ] we establish the result for the general case by decomposing the mimo - mac channel into a set of independent parallel channels .",
    "such a reduction is used both in the proof of the converse as well as the coding scheme .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we use the following notation throughout the paper : for a set @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the set of random variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively . @xmath7 denotes a non - negative sequence of @xmath8 that converges to @xmath9 when @xmath8 goes to @xmath10 .",
