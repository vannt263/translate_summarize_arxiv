    "faraday rotation of the plane of linear polarization occurs during the passage of the associated electromagnetic wave through a region with free electrons and a * b * field with a non - zero component along the line of sight .",
    "when the faraday rotation occurs outside the emitting region in regions of non - relativistic ( `` thermal '' ) plasma , the amount of rotation is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the observed and intrinsic polarization angles , respectively , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the charge and mass of the particles giving rise to the faraday rotation , usually taken to be electrons , @xmath17 is the speed of light , @xmath18 is the density of the faraday - rotating electrons , @xmath19 is the magnetic field , @xmath20 is an element along the line of sight , @xmath21 is the observing wavelength , and rm ( the coefficient of @xmath22 ) is the rotation measure ( e.g. , burn 1966 ) .",
    "simultaneous multifrequency observations thus allow the determination of both the rm , which carries information about the electron density and the line - of - sight * b * field in the region of faraday rotation , and @xmath14 , which carries information about the intrinsic * b*-field geometry associated with the source projected onto the plane of the sky .",
    "systematic gradients in the faraday rotation have been reported across the parsec - scale jets of several agn , interpreted as reflecting the systematic change in the line - of - sight component of a toroidal or helical jet * b * field across the jet ( e.g. hovatta et al .",
    "2012 , mahmud et al .",
    "2013 , gabuzda et al .",
    "such fields would come about in a natural way as a result of the `` winding up '' of an initial `` seed '' field by the rotation of the central accreting objects ( e.g. nakamura , uchida & hirose 2001 ; lovelace et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the first agn jet found to display polarization structure with a central `` spine '' of longitudinal polarization ( orthogonal magnetic field ) with a `` sheath '' of orthogonal polarization ( longitudinal magnetic field ) along the edges of the jet was 1055 + 018 ; attridge et al .",
    "( 1999 ) proposed that interaction with the surrounding medium caused the `` sheath '' and transverse shocks propagating along the jet caused the `` spine '' . since the discovery of this first example , a number of other agn displaying this type of magnetic field structure have been identified ( e.g. pushkarev et al . 2005 ) , suggesting that the conditions giving rise to this magnetic - field structure are not uncommon .",
    "it has also been pointed out that such polarization structure could reflect the presence of an overall helical magnetic field associated with the jet ( lyutikov et al .",
    "2005 , pushkarev et al .",
    "2005 ) : in projection onto the plane of the sky , the predominant component of a helical or toroidal field associated with a roughly cylindrical length of jet will be orthogonal near the central part of the jet and become longitudinal near the jet edges .    although it may be difficult to conclusively demonstrate which of these pictures is correct in any individual agn , one way to try to distinguish between these two scenarios is to search for additional evidence for the presence of helical jet magnetic fields in agn displaying spine  sheath or similar polarization structures , most notably transverse faraday rotation gradients .",
    "another possible sign of a helical jet magnetic field is a systematic rise in the degree of polarization toward one or both edges of the jet , compared to the degree of polarization near the jet ridge line .",
    "this comes about because the degree of polarization depends on the magnetic - field component in the plane of the sky , which will be enhanced toward the edges of a jet carrying a helical magnetic field .                        with this aim , simultaneous very long baseline array ( vlba ) polarization observations of 22 agn displaying full or partial spine ",

    "ghz , the total bandwidth used was split between these two frequencies , so that each was observed at 16-mhz per polarization .",

    "the total duration of the vlbi observations was about 24  hours .",
    "eight of the ten targets observed in our september 27 , 2007 session ( bg173b ) showed evidence for statistically significant transverse faraday - rotation gradients across their core - regions and/or jets , and it is these eight sources that we consider here ( table  1 ) .",
    "the preliminary phase and amplitude calibration , polarization ( d - term ) calibration , electric vector position angle ( evpa ) calibration and imaging were all carried out in the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) aips package using standard techniques .",
    "the reference antenna used was los alamos ( la ) .",
    "the instrumental polarizations ( d - terms ) were derived using the aips task lpcal , using the compact polarized source 0851 + 202 with good parallactic angle coverage , solving simultaneously for the source polarizations in a small number of individual vlbi components corresponding to groups of clean components , identified by hand . to check the solutions , the d - terms for each of the four ifs",
    "were checked for consistency at each station , and plots of the real against the imaginary cross - hand polarization data were used to verify the successful removal of the d - terms .            to calibrate the electric vector position angles ( evpas )",
    ", we used integrated polarization measurements of 0851 + 202 from the very large array ( vla ) polarization monitoring program , as well as the 26-m radio telescope of the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) .",
    "the closest vla polarization observations of 0851 + 202 were obtained on the 29th september 2007 ( 5 , 8.5 , 22 and 43  ghz ) , and the closest umrao observations were from the 25th september 2007 ( 14.5 ghz ) , 28th september 2007 ( 4.8 ghz ) and 3rd october 2007 ( 8  ghz ) .",
    "fortunately , all these integrated measurements were within a few days of the vlba observations , minimizing the probability of source variability between the vlba and integrated measurements .",
    "since the integrated faraday rotation measure of 0851 + 202 is modest ( @xmath23  rad / m@xmath2 ; rudnick & jones 1983 ) , the differences in the evpa between the nearest integrated and vlba frequencies were negligible .",
    "the vla and umrao integrated polarization angles gave consistent results .",

    "we estimate that the uncertainty in these evpa calibrations is no worse than @xmath26 at each frequency .",
    "maps of the distribution of the total intensity @xmath27 and stokes parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 at each frequency were made , both with natural weighting , and with matched resolutions corresponding to a specified beam , usually the lowest - frequency beam .",
    "the distributions of the polarized flux ( @xmath30 ) and polarization angle ( @xmath31 ) were obtained from the @xmath28 and @xmath29 maps using the aips task comb .",
    "maps of the rm were then constructed using the aips task rm , after first subtracting the effect of the integrated rm ( presumed to arise in our galaxy ) from the observed polarization angles , so that any residual faraday rotation was due predominantly to thermal plasma in the vicinity of the agn .",
    "the uncertainties in the rm were based on the uncertainties in @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which were , in turn , estimated using the approach of hovatta et al .",
    "this method is based on the results of monte carlo simulations , and takes into account the fact that uncertainties on - source are higher than the off - source rms fluctuations in the image .",
    "the output pixels in the rm maps were blanked when the rm uncertainty from the @xmath1 vs. @xmath22 fit exceeded a specified value , usually in the range 5070  rad / m@xmath2 .",
    "the effect of the integrated rm is usually small , but can be substantial for some sources , e.g. those lying near the plane of the galaxy .",

    "table  3 gives a summary of the transverse faraday rotation measure gradients detected in the images presented here .",
    "the statistical significances of these gradients typically range from @xmath42 to @xmath45 , with one value reaching nearly @xmath39 .",
    "this indicates that none of the transverse rm gradients reported here are likely to be spurious ( i.e. , due to inadequacy of the @xmath104 coverage and noise ) : the monte carlo simulations of hovatta et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and murphy & gabuzda ( 2013 ) have shown that spurious gradients at the @xmath42 level should arise for 46-frequency vlba observations in the frequency interval considered here with a probability of no more than about 1% , with this probability being even lower for monotonic gradients encompassing differences of greater than @xmath42 .",
    "although the occurrence of spurious gradients rises substantially for vlba observations of low - declination sources , the high significance of the gradient observed across the inner jet of 2345@xmath10167 with its intrinsic ( elliptical ) beam  about @xmath103  is high enough to make it very improbable that this gradient is spurious .    in principle , it is optimal to ensure that the polarization angle maps are correctly aligned relative to each other using the measured vlbi core shifts before using them to construct rm maps .",
    "it was possible to find reliable core shifts for three of the agns considered here ( 0333 + 321 , 0836 + 710 , 2037 + 511 ) ; in three other cases , the core shifts were estimated to be negligible ( 0738 + 313 , 0923 + 392 , 1150 + 812 ) ; in the remaining two cases , it was not possible to get reliable core - shift estimates due to the compactness of the source structure ( 1633 + 382 , 2345@xmath10167 ) .",
    "the similarity of the rm maps made applying and not applying the relative shifts between the different frequencies in the three cases where this could be done gives us confidence that the rm maps for the three sources for which core shifts could not estimated are unlikely to be significantly affected by image misalignment .",
    "the monte carlo simulations of mahmud et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and murphy & gabuzda ( 2013 ) have showed that it is not necessary or meaningful to place a limit on the width spanned by an rm gradient in order for it to be reliable , as long as the gradient is monotonic and the difference between the rm values at either end is at least @xmath42 . we have used the single - pixel error estimates recommended by hovatta et al . (",
    "2012 ) based on their own monte carlo simulations , to ensure that our single - pixel rm uncertainties are not underestimated .",
    "although the signal - to - noise ratio for our rm estimates could in principle be increased by averaging together some number of pixels surrounding a region of interest , the rm values being averaged would be highly correlated due to convolution with the clean beam , making it very difficult to accurately estimate the corresponding uncertainty on the average value .",
    "for this reason , all the rm values we have considered are based on single - pixel estimates , for which the uncertainties are much better understood ( hovatta et al .",
    "note that this is a conservative approach to estimating the statistical significances of the observed rm gradients .",
    "the observed faraday rotation measure depends on both the density of thermal electrons and the line - of - sight magnetic field in the region where the faraday rotation is occurring .",
    "accordingly , gradients in faraday rotation could reflect gradients in either the electron density or line - of - sight magnetic field ( or both ) .",
    "however , if an observed gradient is monotonic and encompasses a change in the sign of the faraday rotation , this can not be explained by an electron - density gradient alone , and indicates a systematic change in the line - of - sight magnetic field , such as would come about in the case of a helical magnetic field geometry in the region of faraday rotation .",
    "sign changes are observed in the transverse rm gradients detected in 0333 + 321 , 0738 + 318 , 0836 + 710 , 0923 + 392 , 1633 + 382 and 2345@xmath10167 , strengthening the case that these gradients are due to helical magnetic fields associated with these jets .",
    "note that the absence of a sign change in the transverse rm profile does not rule out the possibility that a transverse gradient is due to a helical or toroidal field component in the region of faraday rotation , since gradients encompassing only one sign can be observed for some combinations of helical pitch angle and viewing angle .      in the standard theoretical picture , the vlbi `` core '' represents the `` photosphere '' at the base of the jet , where the optical depth is roughly unity .",
    "however , in many cases , the observed core is likely a blend of this ( partially ) optically thick region and optically thin regions in the innermost jet .",
    "since these optically thin regions are characterized by much higher degrees of polarization , they likely dominate the overall observed `` core '' polarization in many cases .",
    "therefore , we have supposed that the polarization angles observed in the core are most likely orthogonal to the local magnetic field , as expected for predominantly optically thin regions .",
    "we have not observed any sudden jumps in polarization position angle by roughly @xmath105 suggesting the presence of optically thick  thin transitions in the cores in our frequency range at our epoch .",
    "this picture of the observed vlbi core at centimeter wavelengths corresponding to a mixture of optically thick and thin regions , with the observed core polarization contributed predominantly by optically thin regions , also impacts our interpretation of the core - region faraday rotation measures .",
    "monotonic transverse rm gradients with significances of at least @xmath42 are observed across the core regions of 0333 + 321 , 0738 + 318 , 0923 + 392 , 1150 + 812 , 1633 + 382 , 2037 + 511 and 2345@xmath10167 .",
    "the simplest approach to interpreting these gradients is to treat them in the same way as transverse gradients observed outside the core region , in the jet . while the simulations of broderick et al .",
    "( 2010 ) show that relativistic and optical depth effects can sometimes give rise to non - monotonic transverse rm gradients in core regions containing helical magnetic fields , there are also cases when these helical fields give rise to monotonic rm gradients , as they would in a fully optically thin region . in addition , most of the non - monotonic behaviour that can arise will be smoothed by convolution with a typical centimeter - wavelength vlba beam [ see , for example , the lower right panel in fig .  8 of broderick et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ] .",
    "therefore , when a smooth , monotonic , statistically significant transverse rm gradient is observed across the core region , it is reasonable to interpret this as evidence for helical / toroidal fields in this region ( i.e. , in the innermost jet ) .",
    "we have detected distinct regions with transverse faraday rotation gradients oriented in opposite directions in 0923 + 392 and 2037 + 511 .",
    "similar reversals in the directions of the rm gradients in the core region and inner jet have also been reported by mahmud et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for the agns 0716 + 714 and 1749 + 701 .",
    "this at first seems a puzzling result , since the direction of a transverse rm gradient associated with a helical magnetic field component is essentially determined by the direction of rotation of the central black hole and accretion disk and the initial direction of the poloidal field component that is `` wound up '' by the rotation .",
    "it is difficult in this simplest picture to imagine how the direction of the resulting azimuthal field component could change with distance along the jet or with time .",
    "however , in a picture with a nested helical field structure , similar to the `` magnetic tower '' model of lynden  bell ( 1996 ) , but with the direction of the azimuthal field component being different in the inner and outer regions of helical field , such a change in the direction of the net observed rm gradient could be due to a change in dominance from the inner to the and outer region of helical field in terms of their overall contribution to the faraday rotation ( mahmud et al .",
    "one theoretical picture that predicts a nested helical - field structure with oppositely directed azimuthal field components in the inner and outer regions of helical field is the `` poynting  robertson cosmic battery '' model of contopoulos et al .",
    "( 2009 ) [ see also references therein ] , although other plausible systems of currents may also give rise to similar field configurations .",
    "we have presented new polarization and faraday rm measurements of eight agns based on 4.615.4  ghz observations with the very long baseline array .",
    "these objects were part of a sample of sources displaying evidence for polarization structures indicating a `` spine '' of transverse magnetic field flanked by a `` sheath '' of longitudinal magnetic field on one or both sides of the jet at one or more epochs in the 15.4-ghz mojave images .",
    "one possible origin for this type of polarization structure is a helical jet magnetic field : depending on the pitch angle of the helical field and the viewing angle of the jet , the sky projection of the field may be predominantly orthogonal to the jet near the central ridge line , becoming predominantly longitudinal near the jet edges .",
    "if these jets do carry helical magnetic fields , their faraday rotation measure ( rm ) distributions should also show a tendency to display transverse rm gradients , whose origin is the systematic change in the line - of - sight component of the helical field across the jet .",
    "all eight of these agns show evidence for faraday rotation measure ( rm ) gradients across their core regions and/or jets with statistical significances of at least @xmath42 .",
    "two more agns with spine  sheath polarization strucure observed in the same vlba experiment showed no signs of such systematic transverse rm gradients .",
    "the fact that eight of ten agns displaying partial or full `` spine  sheath '' transverse polarization structures also show firm evidence for transverse rm gradients supports the hypothesis that both of these properties are due to the presence of a helical magnetic field associated with the vlbi jets of these agns .",
    "it is also striking that sign changes in the transverse rm profiles are observed for six of these eight agns , which can only be explained by a gradient in the line - of - sight magnetic field , not a gradient in electron density .",
    "two of the eight agns considered here  0923 + 392 and 2037 + 511  also show evidence for distinct regions with transverse faraday rotation gradients oriented in opposite directions .",
    "this structure can also be seen in the rm map of 0923 + 392 presented by zavala & taylor ( 2003 ) .",
    "similar reversals in the directions of the rm gradients in the core region and inner jet have been reported by mahmud et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for the agns 0716 + 714 and 1749 + 701 .",
    "this seemingly puzzling result can be explained in a picture with a nested helical field structure , with the direction of the azimuthal field component being different in the inner and outer regions of helical field . in this case , the reversal of the transverse rm gradient is due to a change in dominance from the inner to the and outer region of helical field in terms of their overall contribution to the faraday rotation ( mahmud et al .",
