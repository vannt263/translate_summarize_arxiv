    "in hadron - hadron collisions , production rates of collimated sprays of hadrons , called jets , are sensitive to both the dynamics of the fundamental interaction and to the partonic structure of the initial - state hadrons .",
    "the latter is usually parameterized in parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the hadrons .",
    "thus measurements of jet production properties can be used to test the predictions of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as well as to constrain the pdfs .",
    "because jet production has the largest cross - section of any high @xmath1 process at a hadron collider , the study of jet production provides the highest energy reach for the experiment and a unique sensitivity to new physics .",
    "several jet measurements are now well established at the tevatron , including the measurement of the inclusive jet cross section and of the angular and invariant mass dependencies of dijet events  @xcite .",
    "these measurements provide important tests of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and are input to pdf calculations .",
    "measurements of multi - jet production take advantage of the fact that these processes have the same pdf sensitivity as dijet production , but are sensitive to processes to third order in the strong coupling constant @xmath2 .",
    "fundamental to the understanding of order @xmath3 processes is the three - jet cross - section , which we present as a function of the invariant mass of the three - jet system .",
    "studies dedicated to the dynamics of the interaction are preferably based on observables which are insensitive to the pdfs .",
    "such observables can be constructed as ratios of cross sections for which the pdf sensitivity cancels . in this note",
    "we report a measurement of @xmath4 , the ratio of the inclusive three - jet to the inclusive 2-jet cross - sections .    in this note",
    "we present several recent results for the production of multijet final states in @xmath5 collisions at a center of mass energy of 1.96  tev .",
    "these measurements , which include the cross - section for dijet and three - jet production and the ratio of three - jet to two - jet cross sections , where taken with the d  experiment  @xcite at the fermilab tevatron collider .",
    "the data analyzed were recorded using a single jet triggers at a variety of thresholds , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.7  fb@xmath6 . the event selection , jet reconstruction , jet energy and momentum correction in this measurement follow closely those used in our recent measurements of inclusive jet and dijet distributions  @xcite .",
    "the primary tool for jet detection is the finely segmented uranium - liquid argon calorimeter that has almost complete solid angle coverage @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "jets are defined by the run  ii midpoint cone jet algorithm  @xcite with a cone radius ( for most jet studies ) of @xmath8 in rapidity @xmath9 and azimuthal angle @xmath10 .",
    "rapidity is related to the polar scattering angle @xmath11 with respect to the beam axis by @xmath12 $ ] with @xmath13 .",
    "the jets in an event are ordered in descending transverse momentum @xmath1 with respect to the beam axis .    for all jet studies , a jet energy scale ( jes ) correction",
    "is applied to jet four momentum as the measured four momentum of a jet is not the same as that of a jet entering the calorimeter due to the response of the calorimeter ; energy showering in and out of the cone ; and additional energy from detector noise , event pile - up and multiple @xmath5 interactions .",
    "the jes correction is determined using the @xmath1 imbalance in @xmath14 jet and dijet events . the additional energy from pile - up and multiple interaction",
    "is determined from a minimum bias sample .",
    "the jes corrections are of the order of 50% for a jet energy of 50 gev and 20% for a jet energy of 400 gev . however , for the 0.7 pb@xmath6 data sample used for the measurements presented in this talk , collected with the d  detector during 20042005 in run  ii of the fermilab tevatron collider , the uncertainty on the jes is very small , less than 2% over jet @xmath1 s from 60 to 300 gev .     the fractional uncertainty from the jet energy scale ( jes ) for jets of cone size @xmath15 and central pseudorapidity . ]    for the sake of brevity , the reader is directed to reference  @xcite for a discussion of the inclusive jet cross section measurement , and reference  @xcite for the details on the extraction of the strong coupling constant from the inclusive jet cross section .",
    "of the variables that fully specify the kinematics of dijet production in hadron collisions , the dijet invariant mass @xmath16 and rapidity difference @xmath17 ( or equivalently @xmath18 ) probe the features of lo @xmath19 processes , while measurements of the azimuthal opening angle @xmath20 and ratio of transverse momenta @xmath21 can be used to determine the effect of higher - order processes .",
    "the dijet invariant mass cross section is particularly sensitive to the gluon contribution to pdfs at high @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , the dijet mass spectrum can be used to search for evidence of quark compositeness or new strongly produced resonances .",
    "d  has measured the dijet cross section as a function of the dijet invariant mass @xmath16@xcite .",
