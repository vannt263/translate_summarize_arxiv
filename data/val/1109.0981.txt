    "supernovae ( sne ) are stellar explosions which are luminous in various frequencies of electromagnetic wave . nowadays , the detection rate of sne in optical is about few hundreds per year , while number of sne detection in x - rays are still rare which is less than 50 detections in total .",
    "there are two kinds of x - ray emission mechanisms in sne which are circumstellar - shock interaction or shock breakout . in shock breakout case , shock breakouts envelope of the progenitor which emits strong x - rays in soft band for a short period of time , says minutes .",
    "x - ray transient xro 080109 or sn 2008d located in ngc 2770 ( see @xcite ) is the only case discovered . in circumstellar interaction",
    ", the x - ray emission is relatively stable which can be last for few years .",
    "most of the radiations come from the explosion shock wave pair ( i.e. `` forward shock '' and `` reverse shock '' ) .",
    "when shock from the sn center interacts with circumstellar matter ( csm ) deposited by stellar wind from the progenitors / progenitors companion star , x - ray photons are produced due to thermal , inverse compton and synchrotron emissions @xcite .",
    "according to the circumstellar interaction model by @xcite , cooling shell and forward / reverse shocks pair are formed as the ejecta collides with the csm . in most cases ,",
    "the forward shocks heat up the csm to emit hard x - ray ( @xmath0 10 kev ) while the reverse shocks interact with the ejecta to emit soft x - ray ( @xmath1 5 kev ) . in the early time",
    ", the x - ray opaque cool dense shell between the shocks blocks the soft x - ray from the reverse shocked region .",
    "after several days or weeks , the expanding cool shell becomes optically thin which allows the pass through of the soft x - ray .",
    "since there is a relatively high density in the reverse shocked region , soft x - ray is strong and therefore dominates the entire x - ray emission .",
    "one of the oldest x - ray supernova detected was sn 1970 g by a _",
    "chandra _ deep image of m101 in 2005 , 35 years after the explosion @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of this sn was @xmath2 in 0.32 kev which is consistent with a mass loss rate of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "recent study indicated that there were even older x - ray sne : sn 1941c , sn 1959d and sn 1968d @xcite with x - ray luminosity around @xmath4 in energy range 0.38 kev which were detected by _",
    "these old supernovae are important because they fill up the black box between old and young phases of a supernova remnant .    in this work , x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on _",
    "swift _ was used for searching x - ray sn candidate from different evolution phases . as the _ swift _ archival data is plentiful ( over 30 observations in different field everyday ) , it is a suitable place to do such x - ray sne survey .",
    "total 24 x - ray sne have been detected in this survey .",
    "3 of them are newly - discovered , i.e. sn 1986l , sn 2003lx and sn 2007od .",
    "scientific statistical results of this survey are presented in  2.3 and individual studies of some candidates are discussed in  3 .",
    "there are over 5000 sne have been optically discovered since 1885 which were recorded in detail in the center for astrophysics ( cfa ) archive .",
    "since the sample size of survey target is so large , an automated program was developed to screen all swift archival data in photon counting mode in the period november 2004 to february 2011 and detect if there is any x - ray sne in the field .",
    "here gives a brief idea about how the program was working .",
    "firstly , we developed a local _ swift _ database by downloading all old archival data from the _ swift _ public archive and then using a time - based job scheduler _",
    "cron _ to update fresh calibrated x - ray observations to the database at every midnight .",
    "since the file size of a full data set ( i.e. auxiliary files , uvot data and etc ) is large which is usually larger than 10  mb per observation in size , so only x - ray event files which contain information of arrival photons were downloaded to minimize time and computer resources required .",
    "all observations in the database were classified into groups according to their aim points .",
    "afterward , a list which contains all detected sne positions was extracted and updated from cfa .",
    "the program then did positional matching between the the list and the database .",
    "since the real field of view of _ swift _ is @xmath5 , we set the critical separation to be half length of the diagonal @xmath6 .",
    "once the angular separation between a observation and a sn is less than the critical value , the existence of the corresponding sn in the field of view is confirmed .    for observations that contain",
    "sn / sne in their fields of view , full set of data were downloaded .",
    "observations that belong to the same sn were merged by _",
    "xselect _ to optimize the signal to noise ratio and a corresponding x - ray image in energy range 0.3 to 10 kev was extracted .",
    "all extracted images were then processed by _",
    "wavdetect _ of ciao to detect all x - ray sources in the field .",
    "we set the wavelet scales to be a series from 2 to 8 increasing by a factor of @xmath7 , ( i.e. 2.0 , 2.828 , 4.0 , 5.657 , 8.0 ) . in order to detect those x - ray sources with low counts , the values of the signal and background thresholds",
    "were set to @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , exposure maps generated by _ xrtexpomap _ were used to correct the variation of effective area throughout the image .    according to the pointing accuracy and the angular resolution of _ swift _ xrt ,",
    "a box search of size 10@xmath9 was used to find any positional coincidence bewteen the corresponding sn and sources in the _ wavdetect _ source list .",
    "sources with such coincidences became x - ray sn candidate and went through another 10@xmath9 box search in simbad to do source identification . in case a candidate consists of 1 or more non - supernova identifications , it may be considered to be contaminated by the nearby sources and would be eliminated from the candidate list .    finally , soft band ( 0.31.1 kev ) , median band ( 1.12.0 kev ) and hard band ( 210 kev ) images were extracted from the event files and _ wavdetect _ with the above parameters were applied to each band images to check the count rates of each band and hardness ratios of the x - ray sn candidates .",
    "the asdc swift - xrt simulator was used to simulate _",
    "swift _ observations of series of fake x - ray sources .",
    "the simulated observations were then processed by the searching routines discussed to give blind searches of the x - ray sources .",
    "percentage of sources recovered should be a key parameter for justifying effectiveness of the program . in this test ,",
    "an index 2 power law with hydrogen column density @xmath10 model was used to generate 64 x - ray sources in different locations in image .",
    "we simulated their _",
    "swift _ observations with exposure times 2000  seconds and 5000  seconds . in 2000",
    "seconds simulation , 78% of the x - rays sources were detected by the program while all x - ray sources were correctly identified and only got 3 wrong identifications for the 5000  seconds case .",
    "24 x - ray sne candidates were found in the _ swift _ public archive using our program in the period between november 2004 and february 2011 , including 14 type ii , 9 type ib / c and 1 type ia x - ray sn candidates ( see table  1 ) .",
    "many candidates have been previously studied including sn 1978k in ngc 1313 @xcite , 1993j in m81 @xcite and etc .",
    "we compared our result with the previous publications of _ swift _ and found that sn 2005ke , 2008 m , 2008ax , 2008ij , 2009gj , 2010f , 2010jl , 2010jr @xcite were missing in our list . the reason was mainly believed due to the different approaches of the sn / source detections .",
    "the general x - ray sne searching methods are targeted searches while a blind search method was used in this work .",
    "the latter could be done in an automatic way easily . in order to due with",
    "a 5 years database ( about fifty thousand observations ) automatically , blind search approach was used in this project and it was supposed to be the major reason why there is a slightly difference between the results .",
    "indeed , two of the above missing sne , sn 2010jl and 2010jr , were found in the out blind search .",
    "however , they are too close to the host galaxies , so sn 2010jl was heavily contaminated by the galaxy and sn 2010jr is very hard in spectrum which is likely to be something else ( i.e. emission from its host galaxy ) .",

    "<S> we present a result of x - ray supernovae ( sne ) survey using the _ swift _ satellite public archive . </S>",
    "<S> an automatic searching program was designed to search x - ray sne among all of the _ swift _ archival observations between november 2004 and february 2011 . using the c++ program , </S>",
    "<S> 24 x - ray detectable supernovae have been found in the archive and 3 of them were newly - discovered in x - rays which are sn 1986l , sn 2003lx , and sn 2007od . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , sn 2003lx is a type ia supernova which may be the second x - ray detectable type ia after sn 2005ke @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> calibrated data of luminous type ib / c supernovae was consistent to the x - ray emission model done by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> statistics about the luminosities and hardness ratio have been done to purpose of getting the x - ray emission features of the x - ray supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> the results from this work help investigating the x - ray evolution of sne and developing similar x - ray sne surveys in various x - rays missions .    </S>",
