    "ordinary perturbation theory often leads to asymptotically divergent series @xcite .",
    "several techniques have been devised in the past in order to improve the convergence of the standard perturbative expansion ( see , e.  g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "some of the `` optimized expansions '' that have been proposed are based upon the so - called linear delta expansion ( lde ) @xcite , where the terms in the schrdinger equation are rearranged in `` non - perturbative '' and `` perturbative '' pieces , with the contributions of the latter being minimized by introducing a suitably chosen variational parameter , that is by applying the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite .    recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , an improved ansatz for the choice of the parameter that allows for an `` optimal '' expansion has been proposed and tested in the case of the ground and first excited states of the quantum ( quartic ) anharmonic oscillator ( aho ) . within this scheme calculating an observable with higher precision",
    " that is going to higher order in the expansion  requires the solution of algebraic equations of increasing order .",
    "this can be done analytically , thus allowing one to get analytical expressions for both the energies and the wave functions of the aho at any desired order .",
    "given the success of the method for the quartic aho , one would like to have a formal proof of the convergence of the method and to verify whether it works for more general potentials . in this paper",
    "we address this latter issue , extending the previous study to the sextic and octic aho potentials : this is of interest for the study of realistic potentials  since they can often be approximated as polynomials  and also in itself , since general anharmonic potentials have applications in studies of nonlinear mechanics , molecular physics , quantum optics , nuclear physics and field theory @xcite .",
    "we also improve the convergence of the method for the calculation of the energy with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite , by introducing a variational principle , that is by considering , at a given order , not the expression for the energy stemming from the lde , but the matrix element of the hamiltonian obtained using the wave function at that order and applying the pms to it : since the resulting expression is quadratic in the wave function , one gets higher order contributions that turn out to substantially improve the convergence of the expansion and , at the same time , to satisfy a variational principle .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : section  [ sec_met ] contains a description of the method and a discussion of the computation of the energy through its expectation value and its relation to the variational principle . in section  [ sec_res ]",
    "we present our results for the quartic , sextic and octic potentials , comparing them with those obtained with other techniques available in the literature .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec_conc ] .",
    "the method employed in this paper has been originally devised in ref .",
    "@xcite and applied to the study of the quartic anharmonic potential .",
    "it relies on the the identification of three different scales in the problem , which reflect in a different behavior of the wave function : an asymptotic scale , which is fully determined by the potential ; an intermediate scale , where the wave function decays exponentially , although with less strength ; a short distance scale where the wave function is sizable .    in this work we consider the application of our method to anharmonic potentials of the form @xmath0 and discuss the accuracy of the approximations obtained in this framework in the case of quartic , sextic and octic potentials ( with @xmath1 respectively ) .",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) as a perturbation , although its size is not necessarily small , given the arbitrary nature of the parameter @xmath16 .",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) small .",
    "we now write the following expansions : @xmath24 and substitute them in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , thus generating a hierarchy of equations , corresponding to the different orders in @xmath20 .",

    "however this dependence is artificial since the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) does not depend upon @xmath16 . in the framework of the lde such dependence",
    "is minimized by applying the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite , i.e. by requiring that a given observable @xmath28 ( the energy , for example ) be locally independent of @xmath16 : @xmath29 in the present work we will enforce the pms by using the energy of the state as the observable .",
    "we need however to make an important point : by solving the equations corresponding to the different perturbative orders , we obtain two different estimates of the energy of the solution .",
    "one corresponds to the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq6a ] ) , which was indeed used in @xcite ; the other corresponds to calculating the energy as the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the state described by the wave function obtained in eq .",
    "( [ eq6a ] ) .",
    "this second choice turns out to provide a much better estimate of the energy : as a matter of fact , the energy calculated in this way not only contains contributions of higher order in @xmath20 ( the expectation value of the hamiltonian is bilinear in the wave function ) but it is also constrained by the variational principle ( at least for the ground state ) to lie above the exact result .",
    "therefore the pms applied to the expectation value of the hamiltonian corresponds , for the ground state , to the statement of the variational principle .",
    "this finding is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : compsandw ] , where we compare the energy of the ground and first excited states of the quartic aho  evaluated at order 15  to the average value of the hamiltonian  obtained using the wave function at the same order  as a function of @xmath16 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : compsandwene ] , on the other hand , one can see the ground and first excited state energies of the quartic aho as a function of the perturbative order @xmath30 , obtained after application of the pms both to @xmath31 of eq .",
