    "the mechanisms of adaptation and learning in natural and artificial systems are the subject of paramount interest in neuroscience .",
    "most of the experimental evidence point to the synaptic modification as the physiological basis of the long - term memory @xcite .",
    "hebb @xcite was the first who suggested that the synaptic coupling between two neurons is enhanced if both neurons are simultaneously active .",
    "recent experimental data suggest that the synaptic connections are strengthened ( long - term potentiation ) or weakened ( long - term depression ) depending on the precise relative timing between pre - synaptic and post - synaptic spikes@xcite .",
    "many current theoretical studies of learning in neural systems are based on the quasi - static hopfield model@xcite utilizing mcculloch - pitts neuronal units or simple `` integrate - and - fire '' models of neurons coupled via synapses which accumulate the pre - synaptic activity ( spikes from other neurons ) into a growing membrane potential of a neuron@xcite .",
    "the latter generates its own spike (  fires \" ) once the membrane potential exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "the synaptic strength is in fact not fixed , but changes in response to external stimuli and/or inter - neural dynamics .",
    "various models based on this general picture @xcite , have been shown to yield differential hebbian learning rules .",
    "a complimentary approach to modeling the neuronal activity involves replacing neurons by periodic oscillators .",
    "indeed , rhythmic activity plays important role in many neuronal systems and functions , including central pattern generators , visual and olfactory systems , etc.@xcite .",
    "neural networks can often be described as networks of coupled oscillators , so the role of relative spike timing is played by the phases of individual oscillators ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "close to the hopf bifurcation , the dynamics of the array of coupled oscillators can be described by the landau - stewart equations for complex amplitudes of the oscillators .",
    "furthermore , one can reduce the dynamics of the oscillators to the pure phase dynamics by assuming that the coupling is weak , and the amplitude of oscillations is slaved to the phase variations .",
    "in fact , the phase dynamics description may still be valid even away from the hopf bifurcation point , where the landau - stewart description is not applicable .",
    "this idea was first put forth by winfree @xcite and later developed by kuramoto@xcite and others @xcite . the original kuramoto model , in which the coupling coefficients were chosen fixed and equal , allowed for the elegant analytical treatment within the mean field approximation .",
    "it was shown that the system of globally coupled oscillators with non - identical frequencies exhibits a second - order phase transition as the coupling strength is increased above some critical value .    in subsequent work ,",
    "more complex coupling functions were considered@xcite .",
    "it was shown that depending on the choice of the connectivity matrix , synchronized states with non - trivial phase relationship among the oscillators can emerge .",
    "networks of coupled phase oscillators with appropriately tuned coupling matrix were shown to have neurocomputing properties similar to those of classical hopfield networks , with an important distinction that memorized patterns are stored in the form of relative phases of synchronized oscillators rather than in static equilibria .    in those studies ,",
    "the connectivity matrix , however complicated , was imposed externally to achieve the desired network dynamics .",
    "in fact , in order to achieve certain behavior ( for example , to memorize an image ) , in a system of @xmath0 neurons , @xmath1 coupling coefficients have to be specified",
    ". this would present significant difficulties in operating such a system at large @xmath0 . in biological neural networks",
    "this task is not assigned to any central control unit , but is performed in a distributed manner via the mechanism of synaptic plasticity , i.e. long term potentiation or depression of synapses in response to the dynamics of pre - synaptic and post - synaptic neurons @xcite .",
    "external stimuli directly affect only the dynamics of individual neurons and not their connections , while the synaptic plasticity is a result of the inter - neuronal interactions .",
    "this evolution of connectivity matrix have been introduced in ref.@xcite for the landau - stewart model of coupled oscillators , however no analysis of the joint dynamics of the network of oscillators _ and _ the connectivity matrix has been presented . in this paper , we study the simplest possible model of this process , based on the generalization of the kuramoto model . in particular , we assume that the coupling coefficient for a link between two oscillators is a slow function of the phase difference between the two oscillators .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we introduce the generalized kuramoto model with additional equations describing the slow evolution of the coupling matrix . in section [ two ] , a simple case of two coupled oscillators is investigated .",
    "we show that for large enough separation of time scales of fast and slow motions , the system is bistable : depending on initial conditions , oscillators can be either synchronized or non - synchronized . in sections [ many],[stab ] , we study the existence and stability of the family of synchronized cluster solutions in the continuum limit @xmath2 . in section [ memory ] , we show that the generalized kuramoto system can serve as a very simple model of learning and memory .",
    "information is stored within the synchronized cluster in the form of phase differences between oscillators .",
    "section [ conclusion ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "let us consider the dynamics of an ensemble of @xmath0 coupled phase oscillators @xmath3 here @xmath4 are natural frequencies and @xmath5 are phases of individual oscillators , @xmath6 is a @xmath7-periodic coupling function , and @xmath8 is the @xmath9 matrix of coupling coefficients .    in order to include the mechanism of adaptation into model ( [ phase_eq0 ] ) , we assume that an element of the coupling matrix describing interaction between two oscillators , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , is controlled by the following equation , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a @xmath7-periodic function of its argument . the particular form of the coupling function @xmath6 and adaptation function @xmath13 can be derived from the underlying equations describing the dynamics of oscillators through the reduction to the phase description .",
    "following kuramoto @xcite , we choose the simplest possible periodic function @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , we choose the adaptation function @xmath15 .",
    "this choice implies that the coupling coefficient grows fastest for two oscillators which are in - phase and decays fastest for out - of - phase oscillators .",
    "there are certain indication in the biological literature ( see ref.@xcite ) that the maximal ltp and ltd correspond to small positive and negative phase shifts between pre - synaptic and post - synaptic neuronal oscillations , but we are going to ignore this complication in this model for the sake of simplicity . with the chosen functions ,",
    "our model becomes @xmath16    for small @xmath17 , the dynamics of the coupling coefficients is slow , and one can expect that for two oscillators which are non - synchronized , the driving term @xmath18 is oscillating around zero , and the resultant coupling coefficient is also oscillating around zero and is small @xmath19 . on the other hand , a pair of synchronized oscillators produces a constant non - zero driving for the corresponding coupling coefficient , and therefore for large enough @xmath20 , the connection between the two will be strengthened .",
    "thus , we anticipate a multi - stable behavior , when a group of oscillators can either be stably synchronized or non - synchronized depending on the initial conditions for their coupling coefficient .",
    "to illustrate this point , we first consider a simple case of two oscillators symmetrically coupled through a single link .",
    "in this case model ( [ phase_eq]),([k_eq ] ) reduces to a set of two coupled equations , @xmath21 here @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . by introducing new variables @xmath25 , system ( [ two_osc ] )",
    "is simplified to @xmath26    the nullclines of this system @xmath27 and @xmath28 intersect at large enough @xmath29 . in this case , within each period of the relative phase @xmath30 , there are four intersections corresponding to two stable and two unstable fixed points ( see figures [ phase_plane],b , c . for small @xmath31 , the dynamics of the system can be separated into fast and slow motions . if initial value @xmath32 , the phase variable @xmath30 rapidly approaches the quasi - static value @xmath33 corresponding to the nullcline , without any significant change of @xmath34 .",
    "then , depending on whether @xmath35 is greater or smaller than the value @xmath36 corresponding to the unstable fixed point , the solution either slowly approaches the stable fixed point @xmath37 ( synchronized regime ) , or it reaches the minimum of the nullcline and then branches off to infinity along the fast trajectory . the same occurs if @xmath38 .",
    "this corresponds to the regime of non - synchronized oscillations . for larger values of @xmath31 , the dynamics",
    "can no longer be reduced to fast and slow motions . moreover , for any fixed @xmath39 , there exists some critical value of @xmath40 such that at @xmath41 there are no unbounded solutions corresponding to the non - synchronized motion . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath42 , there are no fixed points corresponding to the synchronized solutions , and the oscillators are desynchronized for any values of @xmath17 .",
    "figure [ phase_plane]b , c shows the structure of the phase plane for system ( [ two_osc1 ] ) for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . figure [ alpha_eps ] shows the dependence of @xmath40 vs. @xmath45 .",
    "as expected , @xmath40 diverges as @xmath46 .",
    "this line together with vertical line @xmath47 divides the parameter plane into three regions . for @xmath42 , there can only be non - synchronized solutions ( fig.[phase_plane],a ) , for @xmath48 there are only synchronized solutions ( fig.[phase_plane],b ) , and for @xmath49 , there is a bistable state when both desynchronized and synchronized regimes are stable ( fig.[phase_plane],c ) .",
    "the results of this section can be applied to a more generic case of many coupled oscillators .",
    "indeed , as @xmath17 and/or @xmath20 is increased , the spontaneous clustering usually begins from synchronization of pairs of neighboring oscillators . for this process",
    ", the coupling between these oscillators and other oscillators can be neglected .",
    "symbols in fig .",
    "[ alpha_eps ] show the results of numerical experiments with a population of 50 oscillators uniformly distributed within a range @xmath50 starting from small randomized initial coupling @xmath8 .",
    "the bifurcation to random parings of oscillators which precedes the cluster formation , occurs close to the theoretical line predicted for a simple case of two coupled oscillators .",
    "in this section we return to the dynamics of the original model ( [ phase_eq]),([k_eq ] ) .",
    "as was pointed out in section [ model ] , for small @xmath17 , in the asymptotic regime the coupling coefficients are either non - stationary but small ( for two oscillators operating at different frequencies ) or fixed for two oscillators which are synchronized .",
    "so , in the limit @xmath51 , we can neglect all @xmath8 for non - synchronized oscillators , and define @xmath52 for synchronized oscillators . substituting this into eq.([phase_eq ] ) , we obtain for oscillators within a cluster , @xmath53 .",
    "\\label{ph_eq1}\\ ] ] where unlike ref.@xcite summation only applies to oscillators within the same cluster , and @xmath54 for oscillators outside synchronized cluster .",
    "it is easy to see that eq.([ph_eq1 ] ) is formally equivalent to the kuramoto model for the double phases @xmath55 .",
    "one can investigate this model in the mean - field limit @xmath2 using the order parameter method @xcite . in this case",
    ", the complex order parameter reads @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the frequency of the synchronized cluster , @xmath59 is the phase distribution of the oscillators in the population which belong to the cluster .",
    "the phases of the oscillators inside the cluster are given by @xmath60 and the phase distribution @xmath59 can be easily expressed via the frequency distribution of the synchronized oscillators @xmath61 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 determine size and position of the synchronized cluster , ( @xmath64 ) . substituting ( [ distr ] ) into eq.([op ] ) , we obtain the equation for the magnitude of the order parameter @xmath65 @xmath66 the frequency spread inside the synchronized cluster is determined by formula @xmath67 which follows directly from eqs.([phases ] ) .",
    "thus , this system exhibit degeneracy so that a variety of synchronized states can be formed depending on initial conditions .",
    "it is particularly evident for the uniform distribution of oscillator frequencies within frequency interval @xmath68 , @xmath69 . in this case , the cluster size drops out , the limits of integration are symmetric , @xmath70 , and we arrive at @xmath71 which reduces to an algebraic equation for phase width of the cluster @xmath72 , @xmath73 the phase width of the cluster @xmath72 depends only on @xmath74 and does not depend on the cluster size @xmath65 .",
    "this dependence is shown in fig.[clusterwidth ] . for large @xmath20 , @xmath75 . at @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "the frequency spread inside the synchronized cluster is equal to @xmath78 ( cf .",
    "( [ omega_c ] ) ) . at @xmath79",
    ", there can be no stationary synchronized clusters .",
    "these findings are confirmed by direct numerical simulations of eqs.([phase_eq]),([k_eq ] ) . in fig.[clusterwidth ] the phase width of the cluster is shown for several values of @xmath74 , and in fig.[unstablecluster ] the evolution of an unstable cluster at @xmath80 is shown .",
    "the parameters of simulations were @xmath81 , and the initial cluster width was chosen @xmath82 .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the order parameter @xmath65 which characterizes the cluster size , can take any value from 0 to @xmath83 ( for the uniform frequency distribution the latter corresponds to the whole population being synchronized , @xmath84 ) .",
    "however , this is true only for small enough @xmath17 . just as in the case of two coupled oscillators ( sec.[two ] ) , at sufficiently large @xmath85",
    ", the multistability disappears , and the only stable state at @xmath86 is the one involving the whole population of oscillators , @xmath87 . in order to determine @xmath88 , we analyze the following problem .",
    "suppose we have a synchronized cluster oscillating at frequency @xmath58 and characterized by the order parameter @xmath65 .",
    "let us consider a single oscillator with frequency @xmath89 adjacent to the cluster ( @xmath90 ) , and study its dynamics neglecting its interaction with all other oscillators and the the feedback influence of the oscillator on the cluster .",
    "clearly , since the frequency difference between this oscillator and the cluster is smaller than that for any other non - synchronized oscillator , the adjacent oscillator will be the first to get entrained at @xmath88 .",
    "the equation for the relative phase @xmath91 of this oscillator reads @xmath92 and the equation for the coupling coefficient between the oscillator and the @xmath10-th member of the cluster , @xmath93 the summation in eq.([ph_eq2 ] ) is carried only over synchronized oscillators .",
    "the phases @xmath94 of the synchronized oscillators are determined by eq.([phases ] ) .    in the continuum limit for the uniform frequency distribution ,",
    "these equations become @xmath95 eq.([ph_eq3 ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath96 where @xmath97 equations for @xmath98 can be obtained using eq.([k_eq3 ] ) , @xmath99 where@xmath100 .",
    "the set of equations ( [ ph_eq4]),([p_eq]),([q_eq ] ) exhibits the dynamics similar to eqs.([two_osc1 ] ) for two coupled oscillators . at @xmath101 ,",
    "the only attractor of the system is the solution with periodic @xmath102 and @xmath103 and unbounded phase @xmath30 which corresponds to `` non - entrainment '' of the oscillator by the cluster . for the phase variable taken _",
    "modulo _ @xmath7 , this solution corresponds to a limit cycle encircling the phase cylinder . at larger @xmath104 ,",
    "two fixed points appear , one of which ( stable ) corresponds to the entrainment of the oscillator by the cluster . at @xmath105 ,",
    "the limit cycle disappears , and the entrained state is the only stable state of the system .",
    "thus , the critical line @xmath106 separates the region of cluster stability with respect to entraining additional oscillators .",
    "this line is shown in figure [ epsilon0 ] .",
    "this line should be compared with the critical line for pairing of two neighboring oscillators ( fig.[alpha_eps ] ) .",
    "note that we have to re - scale @xmath31 and @xmath45 back into original @xmath17 and @xmath20 using @xmath107 , @xmath108 . for large @xmath0",
    ", this line lies below @xmath106 , which indicates that the random pairing outside the cluster occurs before the main cluster loses its stability .",
    "this conclusion agrees with our numerical simulations .",
    "information can be stored within the cluster in the form of relative phases of the oscillators in the synchronized state .",
    "initial learning can be accomplished via driving a group of oscillators by external signals with identical frequency @xmath89 and magnitude @xmath109 , but with different phases @xmath110 , @xmath111 if @xmath112 , every oscillator in the group will be entrained to the external frequency @xmath89 .",
    "so , the external driving signals force the oscillators to oscillate in synchrony and , via slow synaptic dynamics eq.([k_eq1 ] ) , form a tightly coupled cluster . if the phases @xmath110 are taken to be 0 or @xmath113 , the relative phases @xmath114 within the cluster will be also close to @xmath115 or @xmath113 , and so the coupling coefficients @xmath8 will approach @xmath116 . after the learning",
    "is completed after @xmath117 time , the external signal is disconnected ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "if the external frequency @xmath119 , the mean frequency of oscillators within the cluster , the cluster remains synchronized at the same frequency , moreover , the phase relations among the oscillators are effectively preserved .",
    "even significant random fluctuations affecting the dynamics of individual oscillators , do not change the robust structure of the synchronized cluster , see fig.[clusterphase ] .    for small @xmath17 ,",
    "after a cluster is formed , it becomes very stable with respect to external noise .",
    "furthermore , it remains stable with respect to random variations of their natural frequencies .",
    "we let the cluster form similarly to described above , and then at some time @xmath120 , we perturbed the natural frequencies of all oscillators , @xmath121 , where @xmath122 are i.i.d .",
    "gaussian random variable with variance 1 .",
    "we can quantify the robustness of the cluster by measuring the correlation between the synchronized cluster structure before and after the random fluctuations of natural frequencies have been applied .",
    "the correlation was calculated using the formula @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the binary variable describing the state of the oscillator before(after ) perturbing the natural frequencies : @xmath125 if the oscillator is entrained in the main cluster and @xmath126 otherwise .",
    "symbols @xmath127 and @xmath128 denote boolean addition and multiplication , respectively .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath129 when cluster remains unchanged , and @xmath130 if all oscillators leave the cluster .",
    "figure [ correlation ] shows correlation @xmath131 as a function of the perturbation magnitude @xmath132 for several values of @xmath20 .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , the cluster becomes more robust with increase of @xmath20 .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated that a generalized kuramoto model with additional equations describing slow dynamics of the coupling matrix can be used to elucidate the underlying mechanism of synaptic plasticity .",
    "the slow dynamics leads to the multi - stability : synchronized clusters of different sizes and with different phase relationships among oscillators can be stabilized .",
    "the phase differences among the oscillators can be used as a way of storing and retrieving the information in this system .",
    "one natural limitation of the reduced phase description of the oscillators is that all oscillators are assumed to be in the excited ( `` firing '' ) state .",
    "however , in natural systems ( such as biological neural networks ) , some of the neurons may be in quiescent ( `` non - firing '' ) regime .",
    "a more general description of this system should incorporate equations for complex amplitudes of oscillators similar to ref.@xcite .",
    "our results may have important biological implications .",
    "in particular , they suggest that there are fundamental reasons for the wide separation of time scales of fast neuronal dynamics ( e.g. membrane potential oscillations ) and slow synaptic variability",
    ". they also present a very simple ( possibly , the simplest ) model of the _ synaptic reentry reinforcement _ which is believed to be the foundation of the long - term memory stability @xcite .",
