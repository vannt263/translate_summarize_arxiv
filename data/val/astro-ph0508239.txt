    "monitoring how the chemical content of galaxies changes with cosmic time is thus important not only as a _ per se _ diagnostic of galaxy evolution , but also to constrain the history of the global star formation activity in the universe .    for many years",
    ", there have been extensive studies of the chemical composition of gas in the high redshift universe through studies of quasar absorption line systems ( see the review by * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , there has been growing attention to measurements of the metallicities of the star - forming gas observed in distant galaxies at significant look - back times @xcite . in the main ,",
    "these measurements have focussed on the oxygen abundance , [ o / h ] , as computed from a number of empirically calibrated metallicity estimators based on the relative strengths of strong emission lines .",
    "the most popular of these estimators has been the @xmath4 parameter introduced by pagel et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , which is defined as @xmath5\\,}{\\lambda\\,3727 } + { \\rm [ o\\,iii]\\,}{\\lambda\\lambda\\,4959,5007})/ { \\rm h}{\\beta}$ ] . a main reason for the success of @xmath4 as a gas metallicity estimator at intermediate redshifts is that it is relatively easy to measure , as the observed wavelengths of the @xmath6\\,]}{\\lambda\\,3727}$ ] , @xmath7\\,}{\\lambda\\lambda\\,4959,5007}$ ] and @xmath8 lines remain , at @xmath9 , in the optical window .",
    "indeed , the use of @xmath4 has provided key information , albeit coarse , on the gas metallicities of several dozens of intermediate redshift galaxies , and thus opened the possibility of investigating , in a statistically meaningful way , the chemical evolution with cosmic time of the normal galaxy population . specifically , after initial results for a subsample of 15 galaxies were published in cl01 , lcs03 provided gas oxygen abundances based on @xmath4 for a total sample of 66 @xmath0 cfrs galaxies .",
    "there are however some limitations in all work based on the @xmath4 estimates .",
    "first , it is well known that @xmath4 is degenerate with metallicity , as low 23 values can be associated with either high or very low [ o / h ] values .",
    "furthermore , @xmath4 is significantly affected by dust extinction . in cl01 and lcs03",
    "it was _ assumed _ that the cfrs galaxies lie on the high - metallicity branch of the 23-metallicity relation , and the spectra were dereddened assuming a uniform @xmath10 , i.e. , the average for galaxies of the nearby field galaxy sample @xcite .",
    "eliminating these sources of potential error requires a determination of the reddening as well as breaking the 23 degeneracy , for each galaxy individually .",
    "this can be achieved with knowledge of the and lines fluxes , which , at intermediate redshifts , are shifted into the near - infrared ( nir ) wavelength window .",
    "specifically , the reddening by dust can be estimated by means of balmer lines ratios , e.g. , the / ratio , and the degeneracy in 23 can be broken by measuring the nii/ ratio . in this paper",
    "we present new measurements of and for 28 of the @xmath0 cfrs galaxies investigated in lcs03 supplemented by cfht optical spectra to derive and for two galaxies at @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "calibration of spectroscopic data in the nir is symplified by the use of stars hotter than b4 .",
    "these have relatively featureless spectra and allow one to correct the telluric features of the earth s atmosphere and to calibrate fluxes in the nir wavelength window .",

    "this leads to uncertainties of about 10% in the absolute flux calibration .",
    "after bias subtraction , flat fielding , wavelength calibration and geometric distortion correction using iraf routines , the standards 1d spectra were extracted from the resulting 2d frames , the sensitivity response as a function of wavelength was determined using a 3rd order legendre function , and the the flux calibration was done , after correcting the spectra for ( small ) air - mass effects .",
    "the one - dimensional spectra of each galaxy were extracted using the algorithm by @xcite with an aperture of 10 - 15 pixels in y - direction , i.e. about 1.5@xmath342 .",
    "an effective spectral resolution element of fwhm@xmath35 in the j filter , and fwhm@xmath36 in the sz filter , i.e. , 13 - 14 pixels , was estimated from the calibration lines .",

    "[ specsz ] and [ specj ] , to sample the spectral resolution element , thereby maximizing the s / n ratio without any loss of information .",
    "a gaussian filter was used as a kernel for the smoothing , as a gaussian shape well reproduces the typical instrumental profile and thus minimizes any change of shape in the profiles of the observed spectra lines .",
    "eleven galaxies were observed using nirspec at keck ii on the nights of june 14/15 2000 , 29/30 march 2004 , and 30/31 march 2004 .",
    "nirspec was designed primarily as a high - dispersion echelle spectrograph .",
    "we used it in the low - dispersion mode , which replaces the echelle with a mirror , so that the dispersion is provided by the order - sorting grating .",
    "the resulting spectrum is tilted by about 6  from the orientation of the @xmath30 alladin array columns , and the dispersion varies slightly along the projected slit .",
    "the objects were moved on the slit in an a - b - b - a pattern for each 4-exposure sequence , each exposure being 600 s. for each exposure , the following steps were taken before correcting for distortion , in order to optimize both the airglow subtraction and the removal of cosmic rays . for , say , the first exposure at the `` a '' position , the two exposures at the `` b '' position were averaged , gaussian smoothed slightly parallel to the airglow lines to minimize added noise , scaled to match as closely as possible the airglow lines in the region of redshifted h@xmath37 , and subtracted .",
    "we used the _",
    "task @xcite to remove cosmic rays .",
    "we then added back the subtracted spectrum .",
    "the resulting spectrum is simply the orginal spectrum with cosmic rays removed .",
    "after this procedure was carried out for each of the 4 spectra of a group , we repeated the process , using the cosmic - ray - free spectra and retaining the difference image , which was now free of cosmic rays ( including the negative cosmic - ray residuals from the original subtraction ) and largely free of airglow lines , although some slight positive and negative residuals remained .    at this point",
    ", we rectified the spectrum , corrected for distortion , and applied the wavelength calibration ( derived from the airglow lines ) , using the _ wmkonspec _ iraf package .",
    "airglow residuals were removed from the rectified spectra by fitting a cubic spline ( with outlier rejection ) to each row ( i.e. , the cross - dispersion dimension ) and subtracting .",
    "the 1-d spectra were extracted from these images , some additional manual cleaning of `` unfeasible noise '' was done , and the final spectra were averaged together .    final calibration and correction for telluric absorption was carried out with the aid of observations of the a0 v stars hd89239 and 86 uma , and the a2 star hd129653 .",
    "the procedures were similar to those described in section [ speccal ] , the main difference being the need to interpolate across the pa-@xmath38 or pa-@xmath39 lines in the standards in some cases .",
    "the 1d flux calibrated spectra from keck are shown in fig.[speckeck ] .      the and fluxes ( see table  [ infoobj ] ) were measured using the package _ splot _ in iraf .",
    "the flux errors were usually dominated by systematic uncertainties in establishing the local continuum .",
    "the latter was conservatively estimated by exploring rather extreme possibilities . as in lcs03",
    ", we assumed that the flux of is 0.34 of the flux of .",
    "similarly , we assumed an average underlying stellar absorption in of @xmath40 and corrected the equivalent width of this line by this , thereby increasing the line flux .",
    "the treatment of balmer absorption propagates through to @xmath13 , e.g. , correcting too much for the absorption would lead to an underestimate of the reddening and vice versa . using @xmath40 to correct the absorption , the error bars should reflect this uncertainty .",
    "we have not applied any corection to the line which has an observed equivalent width larger than 50 for all 30 cfrs galaxies ( see table  [ infoobj ] ) .",
    "a key issue for the measurement of extinction is the matching between the near - infrared and optical spectra .",
    "we used comparable slits for the optical and the near - infrared spectroscopy , and in the good seeing conditions encountered the resulting emission line fluxes from the spectroscopy should approximate `` total '' fluxes . to check the accuracy of the relative calibration between h@xmath37 measurements and",
    "the h@xmath38 fluxes measured with cfht , we compared , for the seven objects with a detectable continuum , the value of the continuum at the position of h@xmath37 with the continuum at h@xmath38 .",
    "these two measurements of the continuum were found to be consistent at the 10% level with the broad band magnitudes of the target galaxies .",
    "our approach to determine gas oxygen abundances is based on the models of kd02 , who developed a set of ionisation parameter and oxygen abundance diagnostics based on the use of only strong optical emission lines .",
    "the method consists in performing a simultaneous fit to the , , , , and lines in terms of extinction parameter @xmath13 , ionisation parameter @xmath14 , and [ o / h ] . for each set of metallicities , kd02 give third order polynomial fits to the relation between / and the ionisation parameter @xmath14 .",

    "the ranges for the values of the parameters , and the details of the adopted grid are given in table[modelgrid ] .",
    "the grid contains a total of @xmath48 models and is described in detail in the next section .",
    "it should be noted that there might be systematic uncertainties in the kd02 models , but our philosophy is to treat all galaxies at high and low redshift in the same way . starting with the observed line fluxes ( ratios ) and computing oxygen abundances with the same method for the low and high redshift galaxies ( as also suggested and as very important seen by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will allow us to focus on relative effects between the selected samples in the expectation that these are likely to be much more robust than atempts to determine very accurate the absolute metallicity .",
    "the dereddened value for a flux line ratio , @xmath50 , is given by :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the observed flux at a given wavelength , c is the logarithmic reddening parameter that describes the amount of reddening relative to , and @xmath53 is the wavelength - dependent reddening function @xcite .",

    "the best fit [ o / h ] abundances and @xmath76 which are used in the analysis described in the following sections are given in table[cfrshanii2 ] .",
    "the error bars that we report in table [ cfrshanii2 ] are the formal 1@xmath77 confidence intervals for the projected best - fitting values , yielding oxygen abundances with a formal accuracy of typically @xmath78dex , except for few objects , where the error bars are larger because these objects are near the turn - around region or because is not able to break the 23 degeneracy . in detail , the error bars of the oxygen abundance ( or @xmath13 ) are given by the range of oxygen abundance ( or @xmath13 , respectively ) for those models with @xmath79 in the range @xmath80 ( where @xmath81 is the minimum @xmath72 of all allowed models for a given galaxy ) , corresponding to a confidence level of 68.3% for one single parameter .",
    "figure  [ chi2oh ] shows the @xmath72 values projected onto the [ o / h ] axis , showing that generally only one metallicity solution is possible , and also showing the formal range of allowed models .",

    "if only one peak ( with a corresponding @xmath81 ) is intersected by this line , which is the case for almost all ( 28/30 ) cfrs galaxies , than the minimum and maximum oxygen abundances given by the intersection points are used to determine the error bars of the oxygen abundance .",
    "it should be noted that we consider a possible second solution corresponding to the second ( higher ) peak , only if the minimum @xmath72 of the higher peak lies in the range @xmath83 .",
    "there are two of the 30 cfrs galaxies where an alternate model is not strongly excluded ( @xmath84 ) . in these two cases",
    "we also consider the alternative oxygen abundance solutions ( corresponding to the higher , less probable peak ) and will indicate them as open squares wherever [ o / h ] is plotted .",
    "the two alternative solutions are [ o / h]@xmath85 for object 03.0145 , and [ o / h]@xmath86 for object 03.9003 .",
    "it should be also noted that the shape of the log23 vs. [ o / h ] relation is flatter in the high metallicity region ( of the high metallicity branch ) than in the turn - around and low metallicity region ( see figure 5 in kd02 - rotated by 90 degrees ) .",
    "therefore the lower metallicity galaxies in our sample should have larger error bars than the high metallicity galaxies , as we obtain .    in terms of absolute measurements of metallicity",
    "there are three source of uncertainties :    \\(a ) the purely statistical measurement uncertainties propagating through to the parameter determinations .",
    "these are addressed by our @xmath72 analysis .",

    "these uncertainties are presented in table [ cfrshanii2 ] .",
    "\\(b ) second , there are additional uncertainties arising from the methodology - e.g. , averaging together the light from all of the hii regions in the galaxies to derive some kind of average [ o / h]- probably at the @xmath87dex level @xcite .",
    "\\(c ) uncertainties in the kewley and dopita models .",
    "application of many different 23 calibrations to the sdss data ( sara ellison private communication , ellison and kewley 2005 , submitted ) indicates a range of @xmath88dex in the mean [ o / h ] at a given luminosity - with the kd02 models more or less in the middle .",
    "this latter problem is reduced by using the same analysis on all objects and focussing on differential effects with @xmath89 or l , rather than estimates of the absolute metallicity .",
    "our philosophy is to treat all galaxies at high and low redshift in the same way and to focus on relative effects between the selected samples .",
    "therefore , when comparing metallicities of the different samples , we think it is more appropriate to consider the uncertainty ( a ) described above .      in fig.[ohcompfig ]",
    "we compare the best fit [ o / h ] abundances derived with the new method ( and based on the full set of five emission lines ) with the [ o / h ] estimates derived from @xmath90 alone assuming extinction @xmath91 , and presented in lcs03 . despite a substantial scatter , fig.[ohcompfig ]",
    "shows , on average , a good agreement between the old and new [ o / h ] estimates .",
    "the discrepancies seen in the figure between the lcs03 and our measurements based on the kd02 method are due to the following : a ) low / ratios for 5/30 galaxies imply that the upper branch assumption of lcs03 was incorrect for those 5 galaxies ; and b ) the extinction derived using the best fits of five emission lines are higher or lower compared to the @xmath91 assumed by lcs03 , affecting 23 and thus the derived oxygen abundance .",
    "we discuss the physical basis and the implications of the agreement ( and scatter ) in fig.[ohcompfig ] in more detail in the discussion below .",
    "as in lcs03 , we choose the ( * ? ? ? * nfgs ) galaxy sample as a local comparison sample . this sample was selected from the first cfa redshift catalog , and includes @xmath93 galaxies of all morphological types .",
    "the galaxies span 8 mag in luminosity and a broad range of environments .",
    "the spectra are integrated over most of the luminous parts of the galaxies and should thus be similar to the unresolved spectra of cfrs medium - redshift galaxies . from the nfgs sample of 196 objects we have extracted the 108 galaxies with measured emission fluxes for the five lines of [ oii ] , h@xmath38 , [ oiii ] , h@xmath37 , and [ nii ] .",
    "additionally we also use as a local comparison sample 70 galaxies from the kpno international spectroscopic survey ( kiss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which also have measured line fluxes for the five emission lines mentioned above .",
    "kiss identifies emission line galaxies candidates out to a redshift of @xmath94 by selecting objects with detectable or in the low - dispersion objective - prism spectra of the survey .",
    "it should be noted that for the 70 kiss galaxies only line _ ratios _ are available : / ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , / , / , and / ( kindly provided to us by james melbourne ) .",
    "therefore , for these 70 kiss galaxies we can calculate [ o / h ] using our method , but not the ( dust - corrected ) star formation rates from the fluxes .",
    "an essential step required for proceeding with the interpretation of the line emission properties of the intermediate - z galaxies is to establish whether the source of gas ionisation is of stellar origin , or rather associated with agn activity . in order to identify galaxies possibly dominated by an agn",
    ", we can now use the log(/ ) versus log(/ ) diagnostic diagram presented in fig.[linediag ] .",
    "agn - dominated galaxies should appear above the solid line which represents the theoretical threshold between star forming galaxies and agns predicted by @xcite .",
    "similarly to the nearby star forming galaxies of the combined nfgs+kiss comparison sample , it should be noted that all of the cfrs galaxies lie below the theoretical curve , indicating that in all of them the dominant source of ionisation in the gas is recent star formation .",
    "@xcite derived an empirical calibration for the oxygen abundance based only on the / ratio : @xmath95 .",
    "fig.[niiha_oh ] shows the oxygen abundances for the 30 cfrs galaxies with 5 emission line fluxes measured versus their / ratios , compared with the @xcite relation between oxygen abundance and the / ratio .",
    "it is obvious from this diagram that the @xcite relation is only a very rough estimate of oxygen abundances .",
    "this is consistent with the finding of kd02 based on their fig.7 : for log(/)@xmath96 the [ nii]/ metallicity relationship breaks down . although such high [ nii]/ ratios indicate an oxygen abundance on the upper branch of the 23 relation , / can not be used to estimate a metallicity in this regime . at lower [ nii]/ values , the [ nii]/ ratio is less sensitive to metallicity and more dependent on 23 and ionisation parameter .",
    "therefore , / can be used to determine the upper / lower branch of the 23 relation , but it is only a very crude estimate of the oxygen abundance .",
    "the good agreement seen in fig.[ohcompfig ] between the [ o / h ] estimates based on @xmath90 and the new more accurate estimates derived by including the and fluxes into the derivation of the gas abundances comes from two things .",
    "first , the new nir spectra allow us to determine the / ratios for the individual galaxies .",
    "these are expected to be @xmath2 for galaxies that lie on the high - metallicity branch of the @xmath90 calibration . indeed",
    ", we find such high values of / for most of our cfrs galaxies , confirming the assumption made in lcs03 .",
    "note however that 5/30 cfrs galaxies are on the lower branch , but near the turn around region of the 23 relation .",
    "second , the best fits to the five emission lines discussed in section [ bestfits ] provide a mean extinction @xmath97 for the cfrs galaxies .",
    "this is the same as the @xmath91 value that was assumed in lcs03 for the whole sample , establishing that most of the metal - enriched @xmath92 galaxies are indeed not heavily obscured by dust .    on the other hand ,",
    "the scatter around the mean @xmath13 value that we derive from the nir data is large , as shown in fig.[avsfr ] .",
    "in detail , the assumed @xmath98 in lcs03 is correct for only 11 of the 30 cfrs galaxies ( @xmath99% ) , is overestimated for 12 galaxies ( @xmath100% ) , and is underestimated for 7 ( @xmath101% of the sample ) .",
    "this indicates that it is important to determine the extinction for every single galaxy in order to obtain reliable gas oxygen abundances in high redshift galaxies .",
    "the availability of the individual extinction values @xmath102 for our sample galaxies allows us to derive extinction - corrected sfrs from the fluxes . for each cfrs galaxy",
    ", we calculated the sfr using the @xcite conversion of h@xmath37 luminosity into @xmath103 : @xmath104 .",
    "the resulting extinction - corrected sfrs of the 30 cfrs galaxies range between @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "fig.[avsfr ] shows the sfr vs. extinction for the 30 cfrs galaxies ( filled squares ) and local nfgs galaxies ( filled circles ) indicating that cfrs galaxies have extinction properties broadly similar to nearby galaxies with similar sfrs and luminosities .",
    "we did not find strong correlations between any pairs of galaxy properties , from absolute @xmath107 magnitude @xmath108 , oxygen abundance [ o / h ] , restframe @xmath109 color , extinction @xmath13 , extinction - corrected sfr , and ionisation parameter @xmath14 .",
    "this was established by performing a principal component analysis using these quantities as eigenvectors .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the range of measured parameters within the sample and the number of galaxies are both quite small .",
    "the only strong correlation found by this analysis was between extinction @xmath13 and the extinction - corrected sfr , as seen also in fig.[avsfr ] . obviously , such a relation could have been produced by an error in @xmath13 :",
    "if the @xmath13 estimates were randomized , given the narrow range in fluxes in our sample , we would still get a distribution with a mean relation parallel to the direction of the error vector ( dotted line in fig.[avsfr ] ) .",
    "we do not think that this is the case .",
    "the cfrs sample was selected by lcs03 to have an equivalent width @xmath110 , and the sample of our 30 cfrs galaxies has a selection against objects below the dotted line . however , there is no selection against galaxies with low extinction and high star formation rates , which would appear in the upper left corner of fig.[avsfr ] , but which are apparently missing .",
    "the star formation rates _ not _ corrected for extinction for the 30 cfrs galaxies ( open squares in fig.[avsfr ] , derived from luminosities not corrected for extinction ) show no correlation with a@xmath111 . therefore",
    ", if galaxies are lacking measurements of the balmer lines required to determine the extinction , assuming a similar a@xmath111 for galaxies with similar ( _ not _ extinction - corrected ) luminosities would lead to wrong estimates of the real sfrs .",
    "this suggests that it is important to determine the extinction for every single galaxy in order to obtain reliable measurements for the sfrs of high redshift galaxies .",
    "a metallicity - luminosity relation is observed in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the sense that more luminous galaxies tend to be more metal - rich .",
    "fig.[mb_oh ] , an update of fig.10 in lcs03 , shows @xmath108 vs. [ o / h ] for the local nfgs and kiss galaxies and the fits to the respective data , which result in a metallicity - luminosity relation of similar slope and zero - point for both samples , which we use as local comparison . the 30 cfrs galaxies with measured are plotted as filled squares in this diagram .",
    "moreover , as an update of fig.17 in lcs03 , fig.[mj_oh ] shows @xmath112 ( a surrogate for the stellar mass ) vs. [ o / h ] for the 20 galaxies with available k photometry .    in both diagrams the higher metallicity cfrs galaxies overlap with the region of the diagram occupied by local galaxies of similar luminosity ( mass ) .",
    "the lower metallicity cfrs galaxies ( @xmath113 < 8.6 $ ] ) are more luminous ( massive ) than local galaxies with similar [ o / h ] , and more metal - poor than local galaxies with similar absolute luminosities .",
    "a similar trend is seen in fig.[ohsfrjan ] for the sfr-[o / h ] relation : the cfrs galaxies with higher metallicities overlap with the region of the diagram occupied by local galaxies with similar sfrs , while the lower metallicity cfrs galaxies ( @xmath113 < 8.6 $ ] ) have higher sfrs than local galaxies with similar [ o / h ] , and are more metal - poor than local galaxies with similar sfrs .    comparing the average value of [ o / h ] for the 30 cfrs galaxies to the average value of [ o / h ] of nfgs and kiss local galaxies with similar luminosities in fig.[mb_oh ] , we find that the average change in metallicity is about 0.3dex between galaxies at @xmath114 and @xmath3 .",
    "it is not hard to get a change by a factor of two between @xmath114 and @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , pgase2 models @xcite discussed by @xcite can get a track as shown by the dashed curve and symbols in fig.[mb_oh ] , acording to which the metallicity of the intermediate redshift cfrs galaxies may increase by a factor of about 2 by @xmath3 . in this scenario the lower metallicity cfrs galaxies may fade by 0.5 - 0.9mag by @xmath3 , due to decreasing levels of star formation , and migrate in the metallicity - luminosity and metallicity - sfr diagram ( figs.[mb_oh ] , [ mj_oh ] , and [ ohsfrjan ] ) to the region occupied by local galaxies with lower luminosities and higher [ o / h ] .    assuming a uniform @xmath91 lcs03 found @xmath115% of the galaxies in their cfrs sample to have lower metallicities , i.e. [ o / h]@xmath116 , but pointed out that if @xmath117 for all galaxies in their sample the fraction of galaxies with [ o / h]@xmath118 dropped to 5% . our new data , which allow the determination of extinction for each individual galaxy , confirm a high average @xmath13 , and , not surprisingly , a high fraction , actually about one third ( but in a smaller sample than those used by lcs03 ) , of lower metallicity galaxies ( see fig.[mb_oh ] ) .",
    "@xcite apparently did not find the medium redshift @xmath119 galaxies with lower metallicities [ o / h]@xmath118 in their sample .",
    "this could be explained by the fact that @xcite did no corrected the fluxes of their @xmath120 galaxy sample for extinction .",
    "correcting for reddening would increase 23 and move objects with apparently high metallicity to lower metallicity .",
    "also , if not all the objects were on the upper branch , as assumed by @xcite based on / measured for 9 ( @xmath121 ) galaxies of their 64 objects , might result in a lower metallicity for some of the galaxies .    our new measurements of and confirm the low metallicity population of galaxies at @xmath122 found by lcs03 .",
    "it is unlikely ( see also lcs03 , and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that these low metallicity galaxies are the progenitors of today s metal - poor dwarf galaxies ( @xmath123 ) , because they would need to fade too much compared with the observational results of the evolution of the luminosities of galaxies at @xmath124 : e.g. , @xcite found a maximum fading of 2mag between @xmath125 and @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , chemical evolution models generally produce rather `` oblique '' than `` horizontal '' tracks : the evolution in the metallicity - luminosity diagram would be from bottom right to upper left , with galaxies evolving from low metallicity and high luminosities towards higher metallicities and fainter luminosities , as shown by the model in fig.[mb_oh ] .    a more detailed discussion of the metallicity - luminosity relation at @xmath126 including our additional measurements of oxygen abundances of galaxies at @xmath127 and comparison to theoretical chemical evolution models will be given in a separate paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper iv in our series ) .",
    "the metallicity of the star forming gas has been measured for 30 cfrs galaxies with @xmath0 using optical cfht and near - infrared vlt - isaac and keck - nirspec spectroscopy . using the measurements of five emission lines it was possible to determine the extinction , oxygen abundances and extinction corrected star forming rates for these 30 luminous ( @xmath128 ) galaxies . the sample was extracted from the 66 cfrs galaxies for which lcs03 obtained estimates of oxygen abundances based on 3 emission line fluxes ( , , and ) .",
    "the additional and obtained by the near - infrared spectroscopy lead us to the following conclusions :       2 .",
    "the mean extinction @xmath129 for the 30 cfrs galaxies is the same as the uniform @xmath91 value assumed by lcs03 .",
    "however , the large scatter @xmath1 indicates the importance of the determination of the extinction for every single galaxy , to obtain reliable oxygen abundances and star forming rates at high redshift .",
    "most galaxies have @xmath130 confirming the assumption made in lcs03 that most cfrs galaxies lie on the high - metallicity branch of the 23 calibration . however , a minority of them ( 5/30 ) lie on the lower branch , although near the turn - around region .",
    "4 . 20 of the 30 cfrs galaxies at @xmath0 have the higher metallicities ( [ o / h]@xmath131 ) found locally in galaxies of similar luminosities",
    ". however , one third of the cfrs galaxies have substantially lower metallicities than local galaxies with similar luminosities and star formation rates .",
    "this is at the upper band of the range found by lcs03 for the fraction of lower metallicities objects , and is due to the fact that we can account for the variety of reddening when computing the oxygen abundances .",
    "we also find that the average change in metallicity is about 0.3dex between the cfrs galaxies and local galaxies of similar luminosities .",
    "the evolution of the lower metallicities cfrs galaxies will be probably oblique in the metallicity - luminosity diagram : these galaxies will probably increase their metallicities by about 0.3dex and decrease their luminosities by about 0.5 - 0.9mag , evolving into the region occupied by today s @xmath3 galaxies .",
    "therefore they are unlikely be the progenitors of the metal - poor dwarf galaxies seen today .",
