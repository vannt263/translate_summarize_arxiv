    "dendritic patterns degenerate with the appearing of rapidly moving cells .",
    "a demarcation line at @xmath2 divides the regions between the interface instability , @xmath3 , and the absolute stability , @xmath4 , where the planar interface is morphologically stable against small perturbations of its form .",
    "this demarcation line is usually known as the critical velocity , @xmath5 , for absolute stability of the planar interface .",
    "the sequence of growth morphologies , fig .",
    "[ fig : morph_spectr-1 ] , is well - known from experiments on directional solidification and solidification in the undercooled state @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated in computational modeling @xcite of crystal growth as well .",
    "the theory of morphological stability was developed first by mullins and sekerka , who considered the stability of a spherical particle grown into a supersaturated solution @xcite , and stability of the planar front during directional solidification of a binary liquid @xcite . in investigating the evolution of small harmonic perturbations of the planar interface @xcite",
    ", they provided a rigorous basis of linear morphological ( in)stability at low solidification velocity .",
    "particularly , mullins and sekerka introduced a concept of marginal stability for the wavelength of perturbation , which gives neutral stability of the plane when the amplitude of perturbation does not change in time . behind the critical velocity of the marginal stability",
    ", the increasing of the amplitude of perturbation in time may lead to cellular or dendritic interfaces .",
    "the theory @xcite gave rise to a great number of investigations of morphological transformations due to linear instability of interfaces and nonlinear behaviour of unstable interfaces .",
    "these are presented in overview by coriell and mcfadden @xcite and monograph by davis @xcite .    in its classic form @xcite",
    ", the theory assumes a local equilibrium at the interface , which is an excellent approximation for many metallic systems solidifying at small interface velocities . at large driving force for the interface advancing , and with the increasing of its velocity , the analysis of mullins and sekerka can be modified .",
    "trivedi and kurz @xcite extended the analysis of mullins and sekerka @xcite for the case of rapid solidification , and introduced the stability functions dependent on the interface velocity . by taking into account the velocity dependent coefficient of solute redistribution ( partitioning function ) , they developed an analytical model @xcite of microstructure formation under directional solidification , over the range from low interface velocity up to velocity , @xmath5 , of absolute morphological stability .",
    "in addition to the previous analysis of pattern formation and morphological stability of the interface in which the treatment is extended to rapid solidification @xcite and nonequilibrium effects at the interface @xcite , the local nonequilibrium in bulk phases may play an essential role in rapid solidification .",
    "particularly , a deviation from local equilibrium in solute diffusion may act on the rapid advancing of the solid - liquid interface because the interface velocity , @xmath0 , can be of the order or even greater than the solute diffusion speed , @xmath6 , in bulk phases . for instance , the diffusion speed can be of the order of @xcite : @xmath7  m / s . in modern experiments on solidification of undercooled droplets",
    "the interface velocity approaches @xcite : @xmath8  m / s .",
    "therefore , the undercooling of liquids is sufficient for detecting solidification with the interface velocity comparable to the diffusion speed .    considering the process of solute diffusion",
    ", fick s first law is obtained on the basis of classic irreversible thermodynamics of onsager and prigogine which assumes propagation of concentration disturbances with an infinite speed and with local equilibrium in the bulk phases @xcite .",
    "local equilibrium is characterized by the statistical distribution function , given by the first order term of its expansion @xcite . however , for a high - velocity solidification front , the time for crystallizing of a local volume is comparable to the time for relaxation of the diffusion flux to its steady - state value @xcite . in this case ,",
    "local equilibrium is absent in the bulk phases and the solute flux can not be described by the classical fick s first law . including the evolution equation for the diffusion flux , the analysis of galenko and sobolev @xcite shows that the deviations from local equilibrium in phases and at the interface drastically affect both the solute diffusion and the interface kinetics .",
    "therefore , in this article we consider the linear stability analysis for a rapidly moving interface under local nonequilibrium solute diffusion .",
    "the linear morphological analysis of the interface stability has been developed and used to obtain a stable tip of dendrite growing under local nonequilibrium solute diffusion in rapid solidification @xcite .",
    "a marginal stability criterion was used and concluded that at @xmath9 the complete transition to diffusionless solidification may proceed sharply , with the appearing of the break point in the kinetic curves  dendrite velocity - undercooling \" and  dendrite tip radius - undercooling \" .",
    "in addition to this , lee et al . @xcite performed the linear stability analysis in rapid directional solidification using the model of galenko and sobolev @xcite .",
    "as they showed @xcite , the effect of the local nonequilibrium in solute diffusion postpones the onset of the cellular instability in better agreement with experimental data , in comparison with the model predictions in which the local nonequilibrium only at the interface is considered",
    ". however , the analysis of lee et al .",
    "@xcite was not self - consistent ( in the analysis , the authors used an expression for the slope of kinetic liquidus obtained from the local equilibrium thermodynamics ) . as it has been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the predictions of rapid solidification of alloys can be satisfactory compared with experimental data only on the basis of self - consistent model ( i.e. , when all model functions are taking into account the deviation from local equilibrium in the solute diffusion field ) .",
    "consequently , _ the first purpose _ of the present article is to analyze the morphological stability of the planar interface on the basis of the self - consistent model of local nonequilibrium solidification .    in the present analysis , special consideration",
    "is paid to the stability of the interface around the demarcation line , @xmath2 , below which the interface instability occurs and behind of which the absolute morphological stability proceeds , fig .",

    "the kinetics of crystal growth begin to disagree with the predictions of the model in which the local nonequilibrium only at the interface is considered ( see the results of analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . consequently , _ the second purpose _ of this article is a quantitative evaluation of the discrepancy between the present local nonequilibrium model and the model in which the local nonequilibrium only at the interface is taken . it is also in comparison with experimental data on morphological stability of the interface in solidifying alloy .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we give a formal description of departure from local equilibrium due to solute diffusion and give a set of governing equations to analyze the morphological stability of the interface . in sec .",
    "3 we analyze the influence of perturbations in fields and at the interface on the linear stability of the planar interface . in sec .",
    "4 , an obtained criterion of marginal ( neutral ) stability allows us to analyze the morphological stability of the interface for the case of solidification an undercooled melt ( with negative temperature gradient ) and for the directional solidification ( with the positive temperature gradient ) .",
    "the absolute stability of the planar interface is analyzed in sec .",
    "5 . a discussion about expressions for solute trapping and kinetic liquidus which define a final form of the function for the absolute stability of the planar interface is given in sec . 6 . also ,",
    "in this section , we compare the derived function for the absolute interface stability with the available experimental results obtained in si - sn alloy solidification . finally , in sec .",
    "7 we present a summary of our conclusions .",
    "we shall consider a dilute binary alloy that undergoes nonisothermal solidification in infinite space .",
    "let us take into account the heat diffusion in phases , solute diffusion in the liquid , and one can neglect the solute diffusion in solid .",
    "the main physical assumption of the present problem is an absence of local equilibrium both at the solid - liquid interface and in the solute diffusion field around the interface . in this case , the degree of local nonequilibrium is estimated by the relation of the interface velocity , @xmath0 , and the diffusion speed , @xmath6 , which is a parameter of the process of diffusion and can have different values at the interface and in bulk phases .",
    "the speed @xmath6 is a maximum speed of propagation of the diffusion profile in the system and defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the diffusion coefficient , and @xmath12 is the time of relaxation of diffusion flux to its steady - state value .",
    "therefore , we develop the rapid solidification model which is taking into account the finiteness of the diffusion speed in the system .      if local thermodynamic equilibrium in the bulk is not reached , the connection between the vectors of diffusion fluxes , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and the driving forces , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , for the heat and solute diffusion , respectively , have the following integral form : + - _ relaxation of the heat flux _ @xmath17 - _ relaxation of the solute diffusion flux _",

    ". equations ( [ 991a ] ) and ( [ 991 ] ) imply the fact that when the interface moves with a high velocity , local equilibrium in the fields does not occur and the diffusion fluxes at a point in the system no longer depend on the instantaneous gradients of the temperature and chemical composition , but are also determined by the local prehistory of the solidification process",
    ".    equations ( [ 991a ] ) and ( [ 991 ] ) represent general expressions for evolution prehistory of the diffusion processes . for the case of heat diffusion , when the heat propagates with much higher speed in comparison with the interface velocity , the influence of local nonequilibrium in the temperature field on the kinetics of the interface advancing is negligible ( see the analysis of heat transfer in rapid solidification in ref .",

    "( [ 26cab ] ) describes an instant relaxation which occurs at a moment @xmath34 .",

    "the relaxation time , @xmath12 , for diffusion flux is very small and the relaxation effects are negligible .",
    "it is usual to speak in this case of `` viscous diffusion '' which can be accurately described by the fickian local equilibrium approximation .",
    "however , equations ( [ 991 ] ) and ( [ 26bac ] ) describe relevant difference of solute diffusion with respect to the classical fick s law . to date",
    ", departures from this law are known as the appearance of internal effects , couplings of diffusion and viscosity , and longitudinal diffusion ( see refs .",

    "in addition to these appearances , eqs .",
    "( [ 991 ] ) and ( [ 26bac ] ) can also be applied to the process of the phase transition in a strongly nonequilibrium medium .",
    "rapid solidification of a binary melt is a good example of such a nonequilibrium phase transition in which the interface can move with the high velocity comparable with the diffusive speed , @xmath35 ( m / s ) @xcite . in this case , the time for crystallizing of local bulk is of the order of the relaxation time of the solute diffusion flux @xcite , characterizing its decay forward of its local equilibrium value .",
    "therefore when @xmath36 , the relaxation _ interacts _ with the diffusion process directly , and it is necessary to take into account the local prehistory of the solute diffusion , e.g. in a form described by eqs .",
