    "recent experimental work  @xcite in ultracold molecule physics has formed fermionic dipolar molecules of @xmath0k and @xmath1rb in their rovibrational and hyperfine ground state .",
    "quantum degenerate dipolar systems have long been sought after because their long - range interactions makes them interesting for quantum computing applications and for understanding ordered phases that can arise from long range effects .",
    "these systems are both complicated , but tunable , because the long range , anisotropic dipolar interaction can be manipulated with an external electric field  @xcite , and should give rise to rich physics with variety of different ordered phases of matter  @xcite .",
    "the dipolar interaction is attractive if the dipole moments are aligned head to tail , and this can lead to undesirable recombination effects if the molecules have an exothermic reaction possible , as with @xmath2-@xmath3 molecules @xcite .",
    "this can be mitigated by confining molecules to a narrow two - dimensional layer , and setting a strong electric field perpendicular to this layer , so that the dipole moments of molecules are aligned with the external field and always align head - to - head and tail - to - tail . in this case , the inter - molecule interactions are always repulsive .",
    "note that we assume we can create a single isolated plane of dipoles , so there is no possibility to form superfluid pairing between planes , where the interactions are attractive again  @xcite .",
    "we assume the dipolar molecules are loaded onto a single square optical lattice with the molecules fully polarized perpendicular to the plane .",
    "since the @xmath2-@xmath3 molecules can be prepared in their lowest hyperfine nuclear spin state , the internal spin degree of freedom is effectively frozen out , and the molecules can be described as spinless fermions .",
    "previous studies of spinless fermion models  @xcite mostly focused on short range interactions and used the simplification of going to the limit of large spatial dimensions .",
    "these works show a rich phase diagram with charge - density - wave ordering and phase separation .",
    "there also has been some work in two dimensions focused on stripe physics  @xcite .",
    "more recent work , carried out in the context of ultracold dipolar molecules  @xcite , focused primarily on finding new exotic phases ( liquid crystal , smectic , or nematic ) , often achieved by tuning the direction of the external field with respect to the plane of molecules , but has not elucidated the details of the full phase diagram for the density - wave phases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] we introduce the model and describe the possible density - wave orderings .",
    "[ sec : method ] provides the details of the mean - field - theory formalism and the numerical calculations .",
    "the results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , and they are further discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] , which are followed by the conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] .",
    "we describe the rovibrational ground - state dipolar molecules in their lowest hyperfine state with the following hamiltonian : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fermion creation ( annihilation ) operator for a fermionic dipolar molecule at site @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the number operator , @xmath8 is the hopping amplitude between the adjacent sites , and @xmath9 is the long - range dipole interaction , with @xmath10 the position vector for the site @xmath11 . the lattice spacing is taken to be equal to one . with this model",
    ", we have assumed that the hopping occurs only between nearest - neighbor sites , and that the molecules are always in the lowest level of the periodic optical lattice potential ( this second assumption is not always true when the interaction between the molecules is too large ) .",
    "we have also assumed that the form for the dipole interaction is valid even when the distance between molecules is only one lattice spacing .    due to the bipartite nature of the square lattice ,",
    "the hamiltonian can be rewritten in a particle - hole symmetric form and one can restrict to fillings that satisfy @xmath12 .",
    "since there is no spin degree of freedom in this model , it can only support molecule density wave spatial order .",
    "such order is described by its unit cell  a parallelogram spanned by the two fundamental translation vectors for a given density wave order .",
    "the area of the unit cell ( @xmath13 ) gives the number of sites with independent average molecule density which is modulated periodically as the unit cell is tiled across the lattice .",
    "the number of the independent order parameters for this density wave is equal to @xmath14 ( the average density , or filling , is not counted as an order parameter , and is fixed in the calculation ) .",
    "since there is only a finite number of non - equivalent unit cells of a given area on a square lattice , there is only a finite number of possible density wave orders .",
    "we have considered all such orders that have up to four different order parameters ( @xmath15 ) and hence this is a restricted phase diagram restricted to low - period phases only .",
    "the corresponding fundamental translation vectors and the unit cells for the twelve candidate phases are shown in fig .  [",
    "tab : clusters ] .",
    "m1.6 in m1.6 in    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     & & 0.1 +    another , less direct way to observe spatial order is time - of - flight measurements that use the expansion of the molecular cloud to infer the initial momentum distribution of the molecules .",
    "however , the momentum distribution data do not show prominent differences amongst the different ordered phases , so using this approach to detect the ordering is difficult .",
    "the mft results show a diverse phase diagram with a number of distinct density - wave phases .",
    "however , the mft is an approximate method , which neglects fluctuations and favors ordered states .",
    "this brings to mind the question : _ how many of these density - wave phases are actually present in the exact solution _ ?    in the limit @xmath16 , the hamiltonian essentially describes a lattice gas model and can be solved numerically without approximation using classical monte carlo methods .",
    "preliminary results support the existence of the checkerboard ( 2b ) and 4d phases , although strongly suppressed in temperature and filling , compared to the mft result .",
    "since the mft neglects fluctuations , it is not surprising that the range of ordered phases is contracted in a more precise calculation .",
    "however , some higher - period phases become more prominent in the mft solution for intermediate values of @xmath17 , so their presence can not be entirely ruled out by this @xmath16 study",
    ". a more complete study will be the topic of further research .",
    "also , the phase separation needs to be reviewed using better approximation techniques .",
    "the presence of phase separation is tied to the existence of higher - period phases and the fact that the mft strongly stabilizes these phases at the corresponding commensurate fillings .",
    "thus , phase separation is promoted by the mft just like the corresponding ordered phases are .",
    "it is possible that including even higher order phases ( beyond 4 order parameters ) in a mft study would replace the phase - separated regions with higher - period ordered phases that are commensurate at the corresponding values of filling , yielding a devil s staircase - like structure .",
    "another possible alternative to phase separation is the formation of a wigner crystal like state .",
    "the reentrant behavior of the checkerboard phase at @xmath18 in the mft results is very likely an artifact of this method and should be reexamined using more precise techniques .",
    "it is notable that the mft results do not favor stripes that are aligned with the lattice ( corresponding to phases 2a , 3a , 4a or 5a ) .",
    "we found that these phases are either not stable or they are replaced by other phases with lower free energy . for small @xmath17 , good nesting of the fermi surface appears to be important to lower the energy of the system , while for large @xmath17 , strong repulsive interactions between adjacent sites prevents formation of such striped phases .",
    "we also see no evidence for any nematic or smectic `` liquid - crystal '' phases .",
    "another important question is , _ which of these density - wave phases can be reached and detected in experiment _ ?",
    "the mft results show large entropy per particle when the checkerboard state develops at half filling for large interaction , but unfortunately the entropy is severely overestimated in this study , as shown by preliminary monte - carlo results .",
    "the most easily observable features in experiment are the structure factors and the gap in the density of states at the commensurate values of filling .",
    "these features are most pronounced for the checkerboard phase . in a trap environment",
    ", a large gap at half filling should translate into large spatial regions of checkerboard order if the local density approximation is accurate .",
    "of course , it is not clear if phases that are seen in a homogeneous system are stabilized or destabilized by the trap environment .",
    "this is another question to be addressed in a future study .",
    "we have studied the ordering of ultracold diatomic gases on a two - dimensional square optical lattice . we have formulated a model , based on spinless fermions with long range dipole interactions , and solved it using mean field theory .",
    "we have found a number of possible density - wave orders that occur mostly around the corresponding commensurate values of filling and create gaps in the density of states at these values of the filling .",
    "the phase separation is also often seen between different ordered phases in the mft results .",
    "overall , the checkerboard phase is most stable near half filling and has the highest transition temperature . due to the lack of an energy scale associated with spin exchange , the transition temperatures increase with interaction strength .",
    "different density wave phases show characteristic and distinct structure factors .",
    "we have discussed the validity of these results and the limitations of the mft method used in this study .",
