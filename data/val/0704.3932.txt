    "the determination of the dynamical friction force exerted by a gravitating system of background stars on a test star moving through the system is one of the classical problems of stellar dynamics . in his seminal paper @xcite",
    "envisaged the scenario of a sequence of consecutive gravitational two ",
    "body encounters of test and field stars in order to calculate the drag force ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a modern presentation ) . in an alternative approach @xcite and @xcite determined the collective response of the background medium to a moving massive perturber which manifests itself as a polarization cloud decelerating the perturber .",
    "the dynamical friction force law derived in this way is precisely identical to chandrasekhar s force law , if the mass of an individual field star can be neglected against the mass of the perturber .",
    "the latter is to be expected whenever the background can be treated as a gravitating continuum .",
    "the applications of chandrasekhar s formula covered a wide field , ranging from calculations of the dynamical friction and diffusion coefficients of the fokker - planck equation , which is used to describe the internal dynamics of star clusters , to determinations of the sinking rates of satellite galaxies which are accreted by massive galaxies .",
    "the literature on these subjects has become so extensive over the years that we do not attempt any detailed review here , because this would be beyond the scope of this paper . in the context of the sinking satellite problem most of the efforts concentrated on adapting the original concept of an infinite homogeneous background of field stars on isotropic straight ",
    "line orbits to geometries and kinematics appropriate for the discs and haloes of spiral galaxies .",
    "moreover , the finite size of the perturbing body was taken into account .",
    "@xcite followed chandrasekhar s concept of a sequence of two  body encounters of field and test stars and considered a sequence of deflections of field stars by a moving spherical body .",
    "technically the deflections were calculated using the impulse approximation of small angle scatterrings .",
    "the principal result was a modification of the coulomb logarithm so that it does not diverge anymore at small scales , because gravitational encounters at impact parameters smaller than the size of the perturbing body become ineffective .",
    "in this paper we present a rigorous calculation of the dynamical friction force exerted by an infinite homogenous background on a spherical massive body using the wave  mechanical method of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this approach is topically closely related to studies of the exchange of angular and linear momentum in stellar systems ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or in plasmas ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is shown in section 4 below that the shape of the perturber affects only the exact form of the coulomb logarithm .",
    "as concrete examples we calculate the drag force exerted on a plummer sphere and on a sphere with the density distribution of a @xcite profile , respectively , and compare this with the drag force exerted on a point mass .",
    "we assume an infinite homogenous distribution of field stars on isotropic straight  line orbits .",
    "the response of the system of background stars to the perturbation due to a massive perturber is determined by solving the linearized boltzmann equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the gravitational potential of the perturber and @xmath2 is the induced perturbation of the distribution function of the field stars in phase space .",
    "the unperturbed distribution function is described by @xmath3 .",
    "the solution of the boltzmann equation is greatly facilitated by considering fourier transforms of the perturbations of the distribution function and the potential , respectively , @xmath4\\ , , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the frequency and wave vector of the fourier components . without loss of generality",
    "the spatial coordinates @xmath7 and the corresponding velocity components @xmath8 can be oriented with one axis parallel to the direction of the wave vector .",
    "the boltzmann equation ( [ eq1 ] ) takes then the form @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 denoting the velocity component parallel to @xmath6 . equation ( [ eq3 ] )",
    "has been integrated over the two velocity components perpendicular to @xmath6 . in the following",
    "we assume for the field stars always a gaussian velocity distribution function , or specifically in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the spatial density of the field stars .",
    "we find then the solution of the fourier transformed boltzmann equation @xmath14    integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) over the @xmath11velocity leads to the density distribution of the induced polarization cloud .",
    "this has been calculated here without taking into account the self ",
    "gravity of the background medium .",
    "@xcite has shown that in linear approximation the effects of self  gravity can be described by another linearized boltzmann equation of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) where @xmath1 denotes then the gravitational potential of the density perturbation of the background medium . in a self  gravitating system",
    "the density perturbations are the sources of the potential perturbations so that the density - potential pair has to fulfill the poisson equation .",
    "the solution of the combined boltzmann and poisson equations describes simply the jeans collapse of the background medium on scales larger than the jeans length . in real stellar systems or dark",
    "haloes their jeans length will be always larger than the size of the system , because otherwise the system would have collapsed to smaller sizes . since the polarization cloud is contained within the system , self  gravity is not important for its dynamics .",
    "of course real self  gravitating systems are not homogeneous , but their density falls off radially . moreover , their phase space distribution is more complicated than an isothermal gaussian velocity distribution . in such systems",
    "a moving perturber can incite large scale perturbations which contribute to the dynamical friction of the perturber as well ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "obviously these effects can not be described by the simplified model adopted here .",
    "however , @xcite among others have shown , that the drag by the localized polarization cloud on the moving perturber , which we treat here , is the principal effect .",
    "for reference reasons we include in our analysis also the potential of a point mass , which moves with the velocity @xmath15 along the y  axis , @xmath16 its fourier - transform can be calculated using formulae ( 3.754 ) and ( 6.561 ) of @xcite as @xmath17 next , the potential ( [ eq6 ] ) is generalized to @xmath18 which corresponds to an extended body with the mass distribution of a plummer sphere ( @xcite ) , @xmath19    the fourier transform of a moving plummer sphere is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the modified bessel function of the second kind . as third example",
    "we consider a perturber which has the mass density distribution of a @xcite profile , @xmath22 its gravitational potential is given by @xmath23 the fourier transform of a moving hernquist sphere can be calculated using eq .",
    "( 3.722 ) of @xcite in eq .",

    ", , \\label{eq11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where si and ci denote the sine- and cosine - integrals , respectively . the model of a plummer sphere has often been used in numerical simulations of the accretion and their eventual disruption of satellite galaxies in massive parent galaxies .",
    "plummer spheres have constant density cores , whereas numerical simulations of the formation of galactic haloes in cold dark matter cosmology show that dark haloes may have a central density cusp ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus models of a plummer or a hernquist sphere should encompass the range of plausible models for satellite galaxies .",
    "the density in both models falls off radially steeper than found in the cold dark matter galaxy cosmogony simulations .",
    "this mimics the tidal truncation of satellite galaxies in the gravitational field of their parent galaxies .",
    "a more technical point is that a density profile as shallow as @xmath25 as suggested by @xcite lends itself not easily to an analytic treatment , because the total mass would be diverging without an outer cut - off .",
    "the ensemble of stars is accelerated by the moving perturber as @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the full distribution function @xmath28 .",
    "the contribution from @xmath3 cancels out , and introducing the fourier transforms ( [ eq2 ] ) we find @xmath29 }   \\int d^3{\\rm k ' } f_{\\bf k ' }   e^{i[\\omega ' t + { \\bf k}'\\cdot{\\bf x } ] } \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from symmetry reasons the acceleration vector @xmath30 is expected to be oriented along the y  axis . in eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) the frequency @xmath5 , and similarly @xmath31 , is given according to eqns .",
    "( [ eq7]),([eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) by @xmath32 where we have introduced following landau s rule a negative imaginary part , which we will let go to zero in the following .",
    "moreover , @xmath33 so that the potential is a real quantity . equation ( [ eq12 ] ) simplifies to @xmath34 using expression ( [ eq5 ] ) this can be evaluated as @xmath35 next we observe that @xmath36 so that @xmath37 the fourier transform of any potential with spherical symmetry depends only on @xmath38 .",
    "thus it follows immediately from eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) that indeed the two acceleration components @xmath39 as anticipated from symmetry reasons . only in the direction of motion of the perturber",
    "there is a net effect .",
    "according to newton s third law the drag force exerted on the perturber is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the mass of a background particle , so that the drag force is anti ",
    "parallel to the velocity of the perturber . in order to evaluate the integrals over the wave numbers in eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) it is advantageous to switch from cartesian form @xmath42 to a mixed representation @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and we obtain for the deceleration the general result @xmath46 \\ ,   \\rmn{ln}\\lambda\\ , , \\label{eq18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where erf denotes the usual error function . the coulomb logarithm is defined as @xmath47 in the case of a point mass formula ( [ eq7 ] ) implies @xmath48 .",
    "this result was first obtained in this form by @xcite and is identical to chandrasekhar s formula ( @xcite ) , if @xmath49 .",
    "the coulomb logarithm diverges in the familiar way both on small and large scales , i.e.  at @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the coulomb logarithm of the dynamical friction force exerted on a plummer sphere can be calculated by inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) into ( [ eq19 ] ) leading to @xmath52 if the plummer radius @xmath53 shrinks to zero , expression ( [ eq20 ] ) changes smoothly into the coulomb logarithm of a point mass , because @xmath54 .",
    "the integral over the square of the bessel functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) can be evaluated using formula ( 5.54 ) of @xcite , @xmath55 \\label{eq21}\\ ] ] which is approximately @xmath56 in the limit of @xmath57 .",
    "this modified coulomb logarithm converges on small scales precisely as found by @xcite , but still diverges on large scales . a natural cut ",
    "off will be then the size of the stellar system under consideration .    for a perturber with the density distribution of a hernquist profile",
    "we find a coulomb logarithm of the form @xmath58",
    "\\label{eq22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be shown using the asymptotic expansions of the sine and cosine  integrals given by @xcite that the integrand in expression ( [ eq22 ] ) falls off at large @xmath59 as @xmath60 .",
    "thus the coulomb logarithm converges at small scales .",
    "this is expected because , although the density distribution has an inner density cusp , the deflecting mass ` seen ' by a field star with a small impact parameter scales with square of the impact parameter . at small wave numbers",
    "a taylor expansion shows that the square bracket in expression ( [ eq22 ] ) approaches 1 so that we find a logarithmic divergence of the coulomb logarithm as in the case of the plummer sphere .    in fig .",
    "1 we illustrate the coulomb logarithms of the plummer sphere and a sphere with a hernquist density distribution according to eqns .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) and ( [ eq22 ] ) as function of @xmath61 .",
    "1 shows clearly that at given mass small sized perturbers experience a stronger dynamical friction force than larger ones .",
    "since the cut - off of the wave number at @xmath62 is determined by the radial extent of the stellar system , which corresponds roughly to one half of the largest subtended wave length @xmath63 , we use actually @xmath64 as abscissa in fig .  1 . for comparison",
    "we have also drawn @xmath65 in fig .  1 .",
    "the insert shows the cumulative mass distributions of both mass models .",
    "the half mass radius of the hernquist model measured in units of @xmath53 is about twice as that of the plummer sphere .",
    "thus for a proper comparison of the drag forces exerted on a plummer sphere and a sphere with a hernquist density profile the dashed line in fig .  1 should be stretched by a factor of about 2 towards the right .",
    "but it is clear from fig .",
    "1 that the drag force exerted on a plummer is always larger that the drag on a sphere with a hernquist density profile .",
    "this is to be expected because of its shallower density profile .",
    "the logarithm @xmath65 , although being the asymptotic expansion of the coulomb logarithms ( [ eq21 ] ) and ( [ eq22 ] ) for @xmath66 , is not a good approximation at larger @xmath61 .",
    "there is a systematic off ",
    "set relative to the true coulomb logarithms which is given explicitely in eq .",
    "( [ eq21a ] ) for the case of the plummer sphere .",
    "so far we have treated the moving perturbers as rigid bodies . in reality , perturbers can be deformed by tidal fields .",
    "one source of the tidal field is the induced polarization cloud itself .",
    "however , its effect is expected to be small .",
    "the moving perturber induces the polarization cloud in the background medium which reacts back on the perturber .",
    "thus the dynamical friction force and any tidal fields exerted by the polarization cloud is of the order @xmath67 ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ eq18 ] ) .",
    "the deformation of the perturber can be viewed as mass excesses and deficiencies .",
    "the momentum imparted by these ` extra ' masses to the particles of the background medium will be of the order of @xmath68 and can be safely considered as a higher order effect .",
    "there is a further effect if the perturbers are gravitationally bound systems themselves like globular clusters or dwarf satellite galaxies .",
    "such objects can and do loose mass due to tidal shocking .",
    "this mass loss is primarily driven by tidal shocking due to the shrinking of the tidal radii at the inner pericenters of the orbits of the perturbing objects or by disc shocking when they pass through the galactic disc ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "many studies , which can not be all enumerated here , have shown that mass loss , which reduces dynamical friction , plays thus an important role for the evolution of the orbits of the satellite galaxies . in order to illustrate the effect of mass loss , on one hand , and the effect of a finite size of the perturber , on the other hand",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "2 the variation of the deceleration by dynamical friction exerted on a plummer sphere as function of the mass @xmath69 and the radial scale length @xmath53 . as can be seen from the contour plot in fig .  2",
    "both effects can be of comparable magnitude . if one considers , for example , a perturber with a scale length of 0.01 @xmath70 , a doubling of its size has the same effect as a mass loss of 18 percent of the original mass .",
    "finally we note that our analysis can be extended in a straightforward way , to anisotropic velocity distributions of the field stars . @xcite",
    "have shown that , if the velocity ellipsoid is either prolate or oblate , the velocity dispersion in the solution of the boltzmann equation ( [ eq5 ] ) is replaced by an effective velocity dispersion which depends on the semi - axes of the velocity ellipsoid and its orientation relative to the wave vector @xmath6 .",
    "this complicates the evaluation of the integrals with respect to the wave numbers in eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) considerably .",
    "we hope to address this problem in a forthcoming paper ( esquivel & fuchs , in preparation ) .",
    "we thank andreas just for useful discussions .",
