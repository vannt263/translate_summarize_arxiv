    "experiments such as macho @xcite and point - agape @xcite have detected microlensing events towards the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the m31 , supporting the view that some fraction of the milky way dark halo may be comprised of massive astronomical compact halo objects ( machos ) . the fraction of the dark halo mass in machos , as well as the nature of these lensing objects and their individual masses can be constrained to some extent by combining observations of microlensing events with analytical models of the dark halo ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the real dark halo might not be as simple as in analytical models , which typically have spherical or azimuthal symmetry and , in particular , smoothly distributed matter .",
    "cosmological simulations indicate that dark matter haloes are _ neither _ isotropic nor homogeneous but are rather triaxial ( e.g. @xcite ) and contain a notable amount of substructure ( e.g. @xcite ) . even for the milky way it is still unclear if the enveloping dark matter halo has spherical or triaxial morphology : a detailed investigation of the tidal tail of the sgr dwarf galaxy supports the notion of a nearly spherical galactic potential ( @xcite ; @xcite ) whereas that the data are also claimed to be consistent with a prolate or oblate halo @xcite .",
    "the shape of the halo has an effect on the predicted number of microlenses along different lines - of - sight , for comparison with the results of microlensing experiments .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the effects of dark halo morphology and dark halo clumpiness on microlensing surveys conducted by hypothetical observers located in eight @xmath0-body dark matter haloes formed fully self - consistently in cosmological simulations of the concordance  model .",
    "the eight haloes are scaled to approximately match the milky way s dark halo in mass and rotation curve properties , and hypothetical observers are placed on the surface of a `` solar sphere '' ( i.e. 8.5 kpc from the dark halo s centre ) from where they conduct microlensing experiments along lines - of - sight simulating the sun s line - of - sight to the lmc .",
    "the effects on microlensing of triaxiality and clumping in the haloes are examined .",
    "the paper expands upon work in a study by @xcite although we take a slightly different point of view . instead of studying the errors caused by different analytical models fitted to an @xmath0-body halo , we analyse the microlensing survey properties of the simulated haloes directly .",
    "that is , we do not try to gauge the credibility of analytical microlensing descriptions but rather use our self - consistent haloes for the _ inverse problem in microlensing _ @xcite . in other words , the free parameters ( the macho mass and the fraction of matter in machos ) are determined from the observations via the optical depth , event duration and event rate predictions of the models .",
    "this not only allows us to make predictions for these parameters based upon fully self - consistent halo models but also to investigate the importance of shape and substructure content of the haloes .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we describe the @xmath0-body haloes and their preparation in section 2 , the simulation details are covered in section 3 , equations for the observables are derived in section 4 , results are given in section 5 , some discussion is presented in section 6 , final conclusions are in section 7 .",
    "our analysis is based on a suite of eight high - resolution  simulations @xcite carried out using the publicly available adaptive mesh refinement code ` mlapm `  @xcite in a standard cosmology ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "each run focuses on the formation and evolution of galaxy cluster sized object containing of order one million collisionless , dark matter particles , with mass resolution @xmath12  and force resolution @xmath132  ( of order 0.05% of the host s virial radius ) .",
    "the simulations have sufficient resolution to follow the orbits of satellites within the very central regions of the host potential ( @xmath14 510 % of the virial radius ) and the time resolution to resolve the satellite orbits with good accuracy ( snapshots are stored with a temporal spacing of @xmath15 170 myr ) .",
    "such temporal resolution provides of order 10 - 20 timesteps per orbit per satellite galaxy , thus allowing these simulations to be used in a previous paper to accurately measure the orbital parameters of each individual satellite galaxy @xcite .",
    "the clusters were chosen to sample a variety of environments .",
    "we define the virial radius @xmath16 as the point where the density of the host ( measured in terms of the cosmological background density @xmath17 ) drops below the virial overdensity @xmath18 .",
    "this choice for @xmath19 is based upon the dissipationless spherical top - hat collapse model and is a function of both cosmological model and time .",
    "we further applied a lower mass cut for all the satellite galaxies of @xmath20  ( 100 particles ) .",
    "further specific details of the host haloes , such as masses , density profiles , triaxialities , environment and merger histories , can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "table  [ halodetails ] gives a summary of a number of relevant global properties of our halo sample .",
    "there is a prominent spread not only in the number of satellites with mass @xmath21  but also in age , reflecting the different dynamical states of the systems under consideration .    .",
    "summary of the eight host dark matter haloes .",
    "the superscript @xmath22 indicates that the values are for the unscaled clusters .",
    "column 2 shows the virial radius , @xmath16 ; column 3 the virial mass , @xmath23 ; column 4 the redshift of formation , ; column 5 the age in gyr ; and the final column an estimate of the number of satellites ( subhaloes ) in each halo , @xmath24 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the benefits of using @xmath0-body haloes instead of analytical models are : ( i ) we do not have to make any initial assumptions about the velocity distribution of the matter ( other than limiting the circular velocity to 220 km / s ) , whereas analytical models have to adopt a maxwellian distribution . ( ii )",
    "we do not have to make any initial assumptions about the shape of the halo , whereas analytical models are always educated guesses about the shape in form of some given parameters ( e.g. triaxiality , density profile , etc . ) .",
    "@xcite used a so called microlensing tube to get better number statistics for their event rates , and as they note , this `` distorts the geometry of a realistic microlensing experiment '' .",
    "however , our solution ( the introduction of subparticles in accordance to the tsc mass assigment scheme ) to the insufficient mass resolution of the cosmological simulation _ preserves _ the geometry .",
    "the downsides of using @xmath0-body haloes are : ( i ) we assume that the spatial and velocity distribution of machos follows dark matter .",
    "( ii ) the clusters we use are not as old as the milky way .",
    "our models are based upon pure dark matter simulations which may not be appropriate if a significant fraction of the dark matter is composed of machos , since they are composed of baryons , and baryonic physics has been explicitly ignored !",
    "we thus implicitly assume that the spatial and velocity distribution of machos follows the respective distributions of the underlying dark matter .",
    "based upon these assumptions dark satellites comprised of machos would be detectable through excess optical depth values and event duration anomalies in microlensing experiments .",
    "simulations suggest that the majority of these dark satellites can be located as far as 400 kpc from the halo centre .",
    "thus , multiple background sources at distances _ over _ 400 kpc would be needed to detect possible dark subhaloes in a milky way sized dark halo .",
    "for example , point - agape ( @xcite , @xcite ) is a survey that is in principle able to detect even a dark macho satellite , on top of `` free '' machos in the dark halo , because its source , m31 , is distant enough .    from the results",
    ", we can see that halo # 8 is too young to be used as a milky way dark halo model , but all the other haloes seem to behave well . the fact that halo # 8 consists of three merging smaller haloes explains the peculiar values it produces .",
    "the other haloes are not experiencing any violent dynamical changes  a requirement we would expect a model of the milky way dark halo to fulfill .    obviously , our macho mass function is a @xmath25-function .",
    "a more complex function would force us to calculate event durations and rates for individual machos instead of subparticles . in this sense ,",
    "subparticle values are only averages and some of the variation in the observables is lost .",
    "we chose not to use a complex macho mass function in this study because we wanted to concentrate on the halo structure effects .",
    "the variations of @xmath6 and @xmath26 would be larger if we would use a macho mass function covering a large range of mass values .",
    "thus , our results are as conservative as possible , and in real experiments even larger variations of event rates and durations could be expected .",
    "we recognize the fact that in the macho - lens scenario some of the lensing events towards the lmc could well be assigned to machos within the dark halo of the lmc itself .",
    "we have excluded the lmc s macho population in this study , but intend to investigate the characteristics and implications of such lens population in a separate , future study .",
    "our plan is to model the dark matter halo of the lmc with some of the @xmath27 subhalos found near the cores of our @xmath0-body haloes .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the main microlensing characteristics of @xmath0-body dark matter haloes , extracted from cosmological simulations and downscaled in size and mass to represent the dark halo of the milky way .",
    "we argue that analytical halo models are too simplified in a number of ways in the case of microlensing where internal structures ( in density or velocity distributions ) or irregular halo shapes can alter the observed values significantly .",
    "we find that in general observables behave as expected from analytical models , resulting in fairly consistent values with seven out of the eight haloes with the `` outsider '' being exceptionally young ( 3.42 gyr ) and undergoing a major merger of three smaller entties . as a result ,",
    "this particular halo shows irregular behaviour in all tests and can not be considered as a valid model for the milky way dark halo .",
    "when individual experiments are examined in detail , we find that triaxiality and substructures can have a large effect on @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in some haloes , triaxiality can change the observed values by a factor as large as three .",
    "substructure within haloes can also change @xmath5 and @xmath6 by a factor of two and furthermore reshape the event duration distribution notably .",
    "we also use our simulated values together with the macho collaboration s observations to find a preferred halo macho fraction ( @xmath9 ) and individual macho mass ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "our results are similar to the macho collaboration s own analysis where they used several different analytical models . in our analysis of @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    ", the scatter between different microlensing experiments is mainly due to triaxiality and no clear signs of frequent substructure signals can be seen .",
