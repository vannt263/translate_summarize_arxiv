    "complex networked systems are widespread in nature , society and engineering .",
    "some examples from biology are regulatory gene and metabolic networks , the neural network of the brain , the immune system , and , on larger scales , food webs and the ecosystem .",
    "another example , now from the social sciences , is multiagent economics , where a multitude of large and small traders are interwoven together to curse the course of exchange rates and stock prices .",
    "also engineering contributes with communication networks , such as the internet , the world wide web and grid computing .",
    "recently physics has started a new branch , the statistical physics of complex networks @xcite , which takes a generic and unifying perspective at all of those examples .",
    "so far , most of the focus has been on the structure of such networks .",
    "the analysis of a great deal of the above mentioned examples has led to the unifying scale - free discovery and its respective growth modeling with preferential attachment . beyond structure ,",
    "it is now also dynamics on and function of networks , which are about to move onto center stage .",
    "the new insight which along these lines has already been given to regulatory gene networks @xcite constitutes for sure a remarkable highlight .",
    "the impact of structure on dynamics is also key to epidemic spreading and the proposal of efficient immunization strategies for populations and computer networks @xcite .",
    "the structure and dynamical properties of engineered communication networks in general and computer as well as internet traffic in particular were also discussed heavily within the physics community over the last years .",
    "key issues have been besides network structure @xcite also phase transition like behavior from a noncongested to a congested traffic regime @xcite and selfsimilar data traffic @xcite .",
    "so far the analysis of network structure and dynamics has been mostly separated from each other . only very recently",
    "a first coupling of these issues has been picked up , focusing on the impact of structure on synchronization dynamics @xcite .",
    " in this paper we introduce a new and intriguing complex technological system to the physics community , so - called wireless multihop ad hoc communication networks @xcite , and discuss the impact of network structure onto their performance to handle data traffic .",
    "wireless multihop ad hoc communication networks represent an infrastructureless generalization of todays wireless cellular phone networks @xcite . lacking a central control authority in the form of base stations , each end device acts as router and relays packets for other participants .",
    "end - to - end communications are possible via multihop connections . in order to ensure network connectivity , efficient discovery and execution of end - to - end routes and avoidance of data packet collisions on shared radio channels , the participating devices need coordination amongst themselves .",
    "proposals @xcite for such a coordination have already been put forward upon focusing on the connectivity issue . for the other two issues ,",
    "routing and medium access control , the coordination is much more delicate .",
    "routing efficiency would require rather short end - to - end routes , resulting in a small network diameter .",
    "due to the overall presence of interference , medium access control takes care of collision avoidance for data packets traveling on different routes .",
    "it blocks all neighboring devices of an active one - hop transmission and thus would rather favor a small neighborhood , implying a small node degree .",
    "the opposite demands of these counteracting mechanisms leave the network in a state of frustration .",
    "this opens the door for the generic statistical physics of complex networks , asking the question what is the impact of network structure on the performance of wireless multihop ad hoc communication .",
    "well - performing network structures would be those which find an efficient compromise out of this frustration .",
    "they would come with a small end - to - end time delay and a large end - to - end throughput . in this paper",
    "we analyze and compare different wireless multihop ad hoc network structures that are created by different transmission power assignments .",
    "note that the regulation of its transmission power is the only intrinsic control action a communication node is able to perform to enforce a certain structure of the network .",
    "a generic data traffic simulation as well as a semi - analytic approach is used to calculate the end - to - end throughput associated to these network structures .",
    "this allows us to study the impact of network structure on the data - traffic performance of such communication networks .",
    "2 explains the used network model and various transmission power assignments .",
    "some properties of the resulting geometric network graphs are also discussed .",

    "[ sec : meanfield ] and finally a conclusion is given in sect .  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the appendix summarizes the graph - theoretical variables , which are used throughout the paper .",
    "in this section we are only concerned with structural aspects of wireless multihop ad hoc communication networks . upon invoking some justifiable idealizations in subsect .",

    "their structural properties will be discussed in subsect .",
    "[ subsec : properties ] .",
    "wireless multihop ad hoc networks consist of communication nodes , which are distributed in space and communicate to each other via a wireless medium . for simplicity , mobility of the communication nodes",
    "is discarded .",
    "exactly @xmath0 communication nodes are given random positions @xmath1 \\times [ 0,l]$ ] confined to a square area .",
    "other spatial point patterns , e.g.  of clustered multifractal or manhattan type , have already been discussed in connection with the connectivity issue @xcite , but will not be given further consideration here .    the radio propagation medium and the receiver characteristics determine whether nodes can communicate to each other . according to a simple propagation - receiver model ,",
    "a node @xmath2 is able to listen to a transmitting node @xmath3 , if relative to a @xmath4 the power received at node @xmath2 , is larger than the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath5 : @xmath6 @xmath7 denotes the transmission power of node @xmath3 and @xmath8 represents the distance between the two nodes . without any loss of generality we choose the normalization @xmath9 , so that @xmath10 for @xmath11 . depending on specific in-/outdoor propagation",
    ", the path - loss exponent typically falls into the regime @xmath12 and is assumed to be constant .",
    "a specific fixation of its value is not required for our generic view advocated in this paper .",
    "once ( [ eq : propagation ] ) is fulfilled , it defines a one - directed communication link @xmath13 .",
    "if also the link @xmath14 exists , then the two nodes are connected via a bidirectional link @xmath15 and are able to directly communicate back and forth to each other . although not strictly required , bidirectional links are preferred for the operation of wireless ad hoc networks , because many protocols require instant feedback . note also , that according to ( [ eq : propagation ] ) the communication links are defined in the traffic - free regime .",
    "this is an additional simplification and does not take interference into account",
    ".    en route to the construction of random geometric ad hoc graphs one further step has to be taken .",
    "it deals with power assignment and gives a specific transmission power value to each node . according to ( [ eq : propagation ] )",
    "this value can be translated into a transmission range . those nodes which then fall inside this transmission range are then the neighbors , to which the picked node is able to communicate via outgoing wireless links .",
    "power assignment can be done via a number of different approaches .",
    "some of them are presented in the following subsections and lead to network models i - v .",
    "the construction of some of these models is based on standard as well as non - standard graph - theoretical variables , which for convenience are all listed in the appendix .",
    "the simplest structural design of wireless ad hoc networks is to use the same transmission power @xmath16 for each node @xcite .",
    "all existing links are then bidirected",
    ". however , the specific choice for @xmath16 needs to be addressed . if @xmath16 is chosen too small , the network is not strongly connected .",
    "if @xmath16 is too large , too much bandwidth is given away with an increased blocking by medium access control .",
    "hence , in ref .  @xcite it was suggested to tune @xmath16 such that the network remains just about strongly connected ; see also @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this choice for @xmath16 depends on the network size . to proceed further , it is of advantage to first translate @xmath16 into a transmission range @xmath17 , which then determines the mean node degree @xmath18 . with @xmath19",
    "from ( [ eq : propagation ] ) and @xmath20 with the node density @xmath21 we get the relationship @xmath22 . note that in the limit @xmath23 boundary effects can be neglected , so that @xmath24 .",
    "a quick simulation reveals that strong connectivity is guaranteed almost surely for @xmath25 ; see also refs .",
    "the values @xmath26 and @xmath27 have been determined such that 99% of @xmath28 sampled random network graphs per network size @xmath0 had been strongly connected . since the network size is not a control parameter , but limited in view of practical applications , we choose @xmath29 , unless otherwise noted .",
    "this value guarantees strong connectivity for network sizes up to several thousand nodes almost surely .",
    "the upper left part of fig .",
    "[ fig : networks ] illustrates a connected wireless multihop ad hoc graph with this parameter setting .      the const-@xmath16 assignment of the previous subsection has notorious practical drawbacks .",
    "first of all , it is a global rule , where nodes need to access information about the complete network state .",
    "second , the used constant transmission power strongly depends on the nature of the spatial point patterns . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , for random patterns of clustered multifractal or manhattan type the corresponding @xmath18 values are substantially larger than the outcome with random homogeneous patterns .",
    "clearly , a much more flexible power assignment is needed , which only collects local information and acts in a decentralized manner .",
    "a promising proposal has been given recently and has been tested for the various environments : the minimum - node - degree rule @xcite .    by exchanging so - called `` hello '' and `` hello - reply '' messages",
    "each ad hoc node is able to access direct information from its immediate neighbors , defined by its links .",
    "a simple local observable for a node is its node degree .",
    "based on this observable alone , the simple minimum - node - degree strategy for a node is to adjust its transmission power to have at least @xmath30 bidirectional neighbors .",
    "while some of the nodes will end up having exactly @xmath30 neighbors , some others are forced to have more than @xmath30 neighbors in order to give an additional bidirectional link to a node which so far has not accumulated enough neighbors .",
    "the only parameter , i.e.  @xmath30 , turns out to be remarkably insensitive to the procedure on how the random spatial point patterns are thrown . for more algorithmic details and a detailed discussion",
    "see @xcite .",
    "again , a simulation proves that once @xmath31 with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , then 99% or the thrown network graphs are strongly connected .",
    "the dependency of @xmath30 on the network size is much smaller than in the case of const-@xmath16 networks , where @xmath27 . to be on the safe side for all network sizes considered within this paper we fix the minimum - node degree to @xmath34 , unless otherwise noted . the upper right part of fig .",
    "[ fig : networks ] illustrates a typical wireless multihop ad hoc graph based on this parameter setting .      in the next three subsections ad hoc network models",
    "are again globally constructed , respecting special design properties .",
    "they serve to explore new regions of the giant network - state space . for a network consisting of @xmath0 nodes basically",
    "@xmath35 different network states exist .",
    "pick a node and continuously raise its transmission power starting with zero . at @xmath36 , which follows from ( [ eq : propagation ] ) ,",
    "the closest neighbor is able to receive the data transmission from @xmath2 , then at @xmath37 the second closest is able to listen , and so on , until @xmath38 when the most furthest node is also happy to understand .",
    "thus , a power ladder with @xmath39 steps can be assigned to each node .",
    "having @xmath0 nodes , this makes @xmath35 different network states . for sure ,",
    "not all of them qualify because strong network connectivity is a necessary prerequisite .",
    "note however , that the const-@xmath16 and minimum - node - degree network state represent just two out of these @xmath35 states , so that there is a good chance to find new gold somewhere in this giant network - state space .",
    "the third set of network models is generated by minimizing the optimization function @xmath40 in the physics literature such an optimization function is traditionally called an energy function .",
    "here it targets all nodes to come with the same node degree @xmath41 . unless noted otherwise , we consider @xmath42 .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : zweie1 ] ) , which goes with the network diameter , is thought of as a small ( @xmath43 ) admixture guaranteeing network connectivity ; for the case of partitioned networks we set @xmath44 .",
    "the search for the optimized network state is carried out using simulated annealing as described for example in ref .",
    "starting from a more or less random initial network state , two search operations are performed in successive time steps : with probability @xmath45 one node is picked at random and its transmission power @xmath46 ladder state is changed to @xmath47 , or with probability @xmath48 two nodes are picked at random and their ladder states @xmath49 are exchanged . for each operation",
    "the energy is evaluated and the change is accepted with a certain probability , that depends on a computational temperature .",
    "the latter is slowly decreased with ongoing search time , so that tentatively regions of the network - state space are explored with lower and lower energy .",
    "the search process stops once a minimum temperature is reached or the energy has remained unchanged after a significantly large amount of time steps . with the computing facilities available to us , we set the upper limit of the number of nodes for the optimized networks to 100 and also the ensemble size to @xmath50 . for the parameter choice @xmath42 , a typical optimized wireless multihop ad hoc graph is exemplified in the middle left part of fig .",
    "[ fig : networks ] .      as a technological complex system the internet comes with a scale - free network structure @xcite . as the internet and wireless networks",
    "are both communication networks , they have many parallel , but also distinct features .",
    "nevertheless , curiosity begins to ask about the internet - specific scale - free aspect for wireless multihop ad hoc networks .",
    "a rather simple , but straightforward version for the construction of scale - free wireless multihop ad hoc networks uses a modification of the energy function ( [ eq : zweie1 ] ) , namely @xmath51 independently of the other nodes , each node is randomly assigned its own target degree @xmath52 according to a truncated scale - free distribution @xmath53 with @xmath54 . as parameter values",
    "we choose @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . a wireless multihop ad hoc graph , resulting from the optimization of the energy function ( [ eq : zweif1 ] ) ,",
    "is shown in the middle right part of fig .",
    "[ fig : networks ] .",
    "note , that the construction ( [ eq : zweif1 ] ) relies on bidirected links .",
    "for such a link to exist , the two attached nodes need to have suitable transmission power values .",
    "with other words , both nodes have to do something to establish a link , and in doing so , additional one - directed links emerge unintentionally to other nodes in their spatial surrounding .",
    "this is specific to wireless multihop ad hoc graphs and is in contrast to other constructions of geometric scale - free graphs @xcite .",
    "an obvious design principle for the overall wireless network would be to consume as little power as possible . a suitable measure for the power consumption of node @xmath2 is given by the product of its transmission power @xmath58 and its node inbetweeness @xmath59 , the latter representing a measure for the frequency to relay packets within the network .",
    "another , different design principle might be to reach the intended receiver in as few as possible multihop steps in order to reduce the end - to - end time delay .",
    "the respective measure would be simply proportional to the network diameter @xmath60 .",
    "taken together , both design principles lead to the energy function @xmath61 the normalizations @xmath62 and @xmath63 have been introduced for the first and second term , which follow from the intuitively expected @xmath64 , @xmath65 of ( [ eq : zweib4 ] ) and @xmath66 of ( [ eq : propagation ] ) .",
    "@xmath67 reflects the first design principle and will lead to rather sparse network structures .",
    "the second design principle is represented by @xmath68 and will prefer fully connected network structures .",
    "since these two design principles come with opposite demands , it is interesting to study also values of @xmath69 falling inbetween zero and one .",
    "for the parameter settings @xmath70 and @xmath71 the lower left and right parts of fig .",
    "[ fig : networks ] illustrate two examples for respective wireless multihop ad hoc graphs .      the mean node degree , as well as means and distributions of all following single - node variables ,",

    "the power - minimizing limit @xmath74 of network model v produces the smallest numbers .",
    "the scale - free network iv yields the largest mean excess number of one - directed links .",
    "the reason for this routes in the uncorrelated assignment of each node s target degree , which does not adapt to the local structure of the spatial point patterns . for all network models the average link degree is about a factor @xmath75 larger than the mean node degree , the exception being again network model iv , where this factor amounts to almost @xmath76 .    .",

    "[ fig : te2e_gt ] compares the sample average with the results from the generic data traffic simulations and reveals that for all network models i  v the former noticeably overestimates the latter .",
    "this is not the only discrepancy .",
    "a quick look into the second row of table [ tab : te2e ] reveals that according to ( [ eq : tput1 ] ) the end - to - end throughput of network models i and ii would scale with an exponent very close to @xmath77 .",
    "this outcome , being a consequence of the more or less universal @xmath64 behavior , has already been proposed earlier @xcite , but is in conflict with the findings from the generic data traffic simulations .",
    "the inherent difficulty with the at first plausible estimate ( [ eq : tput1 ] ) is that it is built with average network properties .",
    "contrary to the generic data traffic it does not account for the most - critical - node effect , which limits the end - to - end throughput .",
    "analogous to the most - critical - node procedure ( [ eq : vierb1])-([eq : vierb3 ] ) for the determination of the end - to - end throughput ( [ eq : vierb4 ] ) of the generic data traffic , a more sophisticated estimate for @xmath78 is now given .",
    "the mean in - flux of data packets into node @xmath2 , @xmath79 is given by the fraction @xmath80 of the @xmath81 newly created data packets per time step , that will be routed via node @xmath2 at later time steps in order to reach their final destination .",
    "within the numerical uncertainty of the generic data traffic simulations we have tested that the two flux rates ( [ eq : vierb1 ] ) and ( [ eq : muinb ] ) are indeed identical .",
    "a realistic description of the out - flux ( [ eq : vierb2 ] ) is subject to modeling .",
    "a particular simple estimate of the average sending time uses the cumulative node inbetweeness ( [ eq : zweib7 ] ) : @xmath82 as node @xmath2 competes with its ingoing neighbors for medium access , it may have to wait a certain amount of time before sending its packet along a one - hop connection .",
    "the ansatz ( [ eq : tput2a ] ) weights each of the competing nodes with its relative frequent use for forwarding end - to - end communications .",
    "it represents an interpolation between @xmath83 in the low - load limit @xmath84 and @xmath85 holding in the supercritical regime @xmath86 .",
    "as such , it can be hoped that the ansatz ( [ eq : tput2a ] ) catches at least part of the truth when it comes to the proper behavior of the sending time around the critical network load @xmath87 . using ( [ eq : muinb ] ) and ( [ eq : tput2a ] )",
    ", the end - to - end throughput ( [ eq : vierb4 ] ) now becomes @xmath88 like ( [ eq : tput1 ] ) , the expression ( [ eq : tput2b ] ) is consistent with the finding @xmath89 for fully connected networks . in this case",
    "every node has the same node inbetweeness @xmath90 , which results in @xmath91 for the cumulative node inbetweeness .    as can be read off from fig .",
    "[ fig : te2e_gt ] the estimate ( [ eq : tput2b ] ) is closer to the generic - data - traffic e2e - throughput than the previous estimate ( [ eq : tput1 ] ) .",
    "for some of the @xmath92 network models , like ii , iii and v , it even almost matches its data - traffic counterpart .",
    "a similar statement can be given for network models i and ii in the @xmath93 regime ; compare also the first and third rows of table [ tab : te2e ] .",
    "according to the expression ( [ eq : tput2b ] ) the scaling exponents of @xmath94 are directly determined from the scaling behavior of @xmath95 , which has already been summarized in table [ tab : fit_2000 ] , and are almost identical to the corresponding data - traffic results .",
    "in retrospect , this represents a justification for the estimate ( [ eq : tput2b ] ) .",
    "the modeling ( [ eq : tput2a ] ) of the average sending time does not account for its proper dependence on the packet creation rate @xmath96 . this shortcoming will now be removed .",
    "let us assume that node @xmath2 has at least one packet to forward .",
    "if all nodes in its neighborhood have no packets at this instance , then there is no competition for medium access and node @xmath2 can send its packet right away . in this case",
    "competition sets in once some of the one - hop neighbors also have packets to forward .",
    "in addition , also some of the two - hop neighbors enter the competition , once they have packets to transmit to one - hop neighbors of @xmath2 .",
    "this brings us to the structural ansatz : @xmath98 for simplification , we neglect spatio - temporal correlations of the network traffic . the independent - node picture then leads to @xmath99 for the competition term from the one - hop neighbors .",
    "it sums over the probabilities of ingoing one - hop neighbors to have at least one packet ( @xmath100 ) to forward .",
    "on the same footing , the competition term from the two - hop neighbors results to be @xmath101 here it is not sufficient for a two - hop neighbor @xmath102 to have at least one packet , the packet also needs to be forwarded to a one - hop neighbor @xmath103 in order to compete with @xmath2 for medium access .",
    "the ratio @xmath104 represents this fraction .",
    "note , that with ( [ eq : tsend2 ] ) the competition strength of the two - hop neighbors is overestimated .",
    "active three hop - neighbors might have already blocked some of the two - hop neighbors , so that the sum over @xmath102 should not extend to the complete two - hop neighborhood of node @xmath2 .",
    "to a minor fraction this overestimation is also true for the expression ( [ eq : tsend1 ] ) , since a competing one - hop neighbor might already be blocked by an earlier assigned transmission between two two - hop neighbors .",
    "consequently , the expressions ( [ eq : tsend1 ] ) and ( [ eq : tsend2 ] ) should be corrected by the probability that the one- and two - hop neighbor is not blocked , respectively . for the moment",
    "this is too much of a complication . from now on we will operationally proceed with two versions of ( [ eq : tsend12 ] ) , one excluding and the other including the @xmath105 contribution ( [ eq : tsend2 ] ) .",
    "we are left to model the probability distributions @xmath106 of the queue lengths in the independent - node picture .",
    "it is sufficient to characterize the single - node data traffic statistics by the average in- and out - flux . in the stationary limit , this immeadiately leads to the rate equation @xmath107 its solution leads to @xmath108 making again use of ( [ eq : vierb2 ] ) and ( [ eq : muinb ] ) , the proposed relation ( [ eq : tsend12 ] ) for the average sending time then transforms into an inhomogeneous set of @xmath0 coupled linear equations : @xmath109 the solution for the node - dependent average sending times will explicitly depend on the packet creation rate @xmath96 in a nonlinear way .",
    "let us stress this last point by picking a fully connected network as an example .",
    "since every node is already a one - hop neighbor to each other , the last term on the righthand side of ( [ eq : lineqs ] ) has to be dropped .",
    "furthermore , @xmath90 for every node and by symmetry all @xmath110 are identical .",
    "this transforms ( [ eq : lineqs ] ) into @xmath111 , which is a nonlinear function of the packet creation rate .",
    "let us continue for a moment , use the last result for the out - flux ( [ eq : vierb2 ] ) and equate it to the in - flux ( [ eq : muinb ] ) , then as expected the critical network load results in @xmath112 . upon inserting this into the expression for the sending time , we arrive at @xmath113 , which again reflects our intuition that at the critical network load every node has to compete with every other node for medium access .    of course for other , more complicated network structures a further analytical insight into ( [ eq : lineqs ] ) is hard to give .",
    "however , once a specific network realization of size @xmath0 is constructed , the numerically accessible node and link inbetweeness variables serve as input and the coupled linear equations can be solved numerically as a function of @xmath96 .",
    "the solution of ( [ eq : lineqs ] ) fixes the out - flux ( [ eq : vierb2 ] ) . upon setting this equal to the in - flux ( [ eq : vierb1 ] )",
    ", the node - specific critical packet creation rate is determined to @xmath114 . via ( [ eq : vierb3 ] ) and ( [ eq : vierb4 ] ) this finally leads to the expression @xmath115 for the end - to - end throughput . for consistency",
    ", we again check on fully connected networks with @xmath90 and @xmath116 , which leads to @xmath89 .    depending on whether the two - hop contribution @xmath105 is ex- or included in ( [ eq : lineqs ] )",
    ", two further estimates for the end - to - end throughput can be given for network models i  v .",
    "they are both illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : te2e_gt ] .",
    "the @xmath105-excluding estimate yields an end - to - end throughput a little larger than the result obtained from the generic data traffic simulations . except for network model",
    "i , the @xmath105-including estimate produces a remarkable agreement with the generic data - traffic observations for small network sizes . for larger network sizes of models",
    "i and ii the two estimates with and without @xmath105 narrowly sandwich the generic data - traffic outcome .",
    "moreover , the fourth and fifth row of table [ tab : te2e ] confirm that the corresponding scaling exponents for @xmath117 are in close agreement with those found from the generic data traffic simulations .",
    "all of this clearly demonstrates that the deviations from the previously proposed @xmath118 @xcite are a consequence of the most - critical - node effect and that these deviations do show a strong dependence on the underlying network structure .",
    "wireless ad hoc communication networks represent an example for a complex , networked technological system .",
    "their key operational controls , routing and medium access control , come with opposite demands and leave the network in a state of frustration .",
    "this opens the door for the statistical physics of complex networks to ask , what are efficient network structures in order to find a good compromise .",
    "various network models , all of them constrained by spatial geometry , the wireless propagation medium and some selected design principles , have been proposed to explore the huge network structure state space and to test the impact of network structure on network performance . as a measure",
    "the end - to - end throughput has been chosen .",
    "it represents the network s capacity , sometimes also called bandwidth , to deliver a certain amount of end - to - end communications per time without network overloading . a generic data traffic simulation as well as several semianalytic estimates of increasing sophistication",
    "demonstrate that ( i ) below a critical network size a fully connected structure always comes with the largest and then size - independent throughput , ( ii ) well above the critical network size the throughput scales as @xmath94 with network size @xmath0 , ( iii ) contrary to current mean - field belief @xcite @xmath119 due to the most - critical node effect , and ( iv ) the scaling exponent @xmath120 depends on the specific structure of the picked network model .",
    "another , although smaller discovery along the way has been that different network structure models lead to quite different average transmission power values , but once the latter is weighted with the amount of data traffic passing over a node , the differences in power consumption between the network structure models decline .",
    "the generic network approach to wireless ad hoc communication , which has been advocated in this paper , gives guidance to several yet - to - come generalizations .",
    "straightforward issues like the spatial heterogeneity of static and mobile point patterns , the spatio - temporal heterogeneity of the wireless propagation medium , interference , synchronization and different user behavior for the modeling of data traffic need to be addressed .",
    "additional network structure models , directly resulting from the global optimization of design principles , like the maximization of end - to - end throughput itself , need to be developed and will then serve as benchmarks for an even bigger challenge , the construction of such optimized network structures via decentralized topology control rules . functional aspects like routing coupled to congestion control and new technology - driven aspects like geometric routing @xcite are then also becoming important .",
    "this underlines that it is still a longer way to reach a truly selforganizational control of wireless ad hoc networks and other networked technological systems . upon further pursuing this road",
    ", it is a good idea to learn more about selforganization also from other networked complex systems out of physics , biology and sociology .",

    "the @xmath122 adjacency matrix @xmath123 ( link @xmath124 exists ) or @xmath125 ( link @xmath124 does not exist , or @xmath126 ) most naturally embraces the existence and nonexistence of links between nodes .",
    "the node degree is smaller or equal to the outgoing node degree @xmath127 or the ingoing node degree @xmath128 .",
    "the sets of bidirected , outgoing and ingoing neighbors of node @xmath2 are denoted as @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .      using the definition @xmath132 for all",
    "bidirected links @xmath133 , the link degree @xmath134 is similar to the node degree @xmath135 .",
    "it counts the number of bidirected neighbors , which are attached either to node @xmath2 or to node @xmath3 or to both .",
    "two straightforward and selfexplaining generalizations are @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "they are of direct relevance for wireless multihop ad hoc networks .",
    "@xmath136 counts all outgoing neighboring nodes of the active one - hop link @xmath133 , which are silenced by medium access control , and @xmath137 represents the maximum number of possible data packet senders , which directly compete with nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 for medium access .",

    "one - directed variants of the cluster coefficient are not considered .",
    "analogous to the distinction between node and link degree , the cluster coefficient can not only be defined in the node - based manner , but also in the link - based manner @xmath139 ) \\sum_{m_1>m_2\\in{\\mathcal n}_{i{\\leftrightarrow}j } } a_{m_1m_2 } a_{m_2m_1}$ ] .",

    "the shortest - path distance @xmath141 counts the number of bidirected hops along the shortest ( in units of hops ) path between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the diameter @xmath142 is given by double averaging , in the first step a mean over all node pairs of one network realization and in the second step a mean over a sample of network realizations .      for simplicity , we assume table - based shortest - path routing using bidirected links for all possible end - to - end communications within the network . in general different nodes will be used with different frequency for the relaying of packets .",
    "a measure of this frequency is given by the node inbetweeness @xmath59 , which counts the number of shortest paths out of the @xmath143 different shortest end - to - end communication routes going via node @xmath2 . to be more precise ,",
    "all nodes that are subsequently transmitting along such a shortest path , add a one to their respective node - inbetweeness counter ; this includes the initially transmitting node , but not the final recipient .",
    "if between two ends more than one , say @xmath144 shortest paths exist , then each path is weighted with @xmath145 and nodes along such a path add this weight to their node - inbetweeness counter .",
    "this definition of node inbetweeness is similar to the well known betweenness centrality @xcite .",
    "contrary to the former , the latter excludes contributions from the initial and final node . for the calculation of the node inbetweeness we use an all - pairs shortest path algorithm similar to",
    "that described in ref .",
    "the sum rule @xmath146 relates the average node inbetweeness to the network diameter .      similar to the definition of node inbetweeness the link inbetweeness is a measure for the importance of a link .",
    "the link inbetweeness @xmath147 counts the number of shortest paths that contain the link @xmath133 .",
    "if there exist @xmath144 shortest paths between two nodes , we proceed as described above for the node inbetweeness , where each of these paths gets the weight @xmath145 .",
    "the link inbetweeness is connected with the node inbetweeness by the flux rule @xmath148 which allows to express the mean link inbetweeness @xmath149 in terms of the network diameter and the mean node degree .      for our discussion in sect .",
    "[ sec : meanfield ] on the end - to - end throughput the quantity @xmath150 is of relevance .",
    "we call it the cumulative node inbetweeness , since it adds the node inbetweennesses of all ingoing neighbors to the node inbetweeness of node @xmath2",
    ". the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : zweib7 ] ) , when divided by @xmath59 , can be seen as an inbetweeness - weighted ingoing node degree . by reordering ,",
    "the mean can be expressed as @xmath151 .",
