    "the scientific career of markus bttiker was devoted to mesoscopic physics . over several decades he made profound contributions to the field .",
    "he worked on the scattering theory of electronic conductors  @xcite , dephasing  @xcite , edge channel transport  @xcite , dynamic conductors  @xcite , shot noise  @xcite and full counting statistics  @xcite , electronic entanglement  @xcite , fluctuation relations  @xcite , quantum heat engines  @xcite , majorana fermions  @xcite , as well as many other topics . early in his career he became interested in the traversal time for tunneling through a potential barrier  @xcite .",
    "he returned to questions concerning time in quantum mechanics in some of his last papers , where he investigated the waiting times between electronic transfers in mesoscopic conductors  @xcite .    during a sabbatical at university of basel",
    ", he initiated his research on the mesoscopic capacitor @xcite .",
    "the aim was to develop a quantum analogue of an @xmath0-circuit .",
    "classically , a capacitor in series with a resistor discharges on a characteristic time scale given by the @xmath0-time , @xmath1 .",
    "the quantum analogue proposed by markus bttiker and his co - workers consists of a small cavity connected to an electron reservoir via a quantum point contact ( qpc ) .",
    "one might expect this capacitor to discharge over the @xmath0-time given by the geometric capacitance @xmath2 of the cavity and the qpc resistance @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the resistance quantum and @xmath5 the transmission .",
    "nevertheless , due to phase coherence throughout the system , the situation turns out to be different .    at low frequencies",
    "the setup still behaves like an @xmath0-circuit .",
    "however , for small voltage excitations , the charge relaxation resistance is universal and independent of the qpc transmission . in particular , for a single - channel qpc the charge relaxation resistance is simply half the value of the resistance quantum @xmath6 this prediction has been verified experimentally  @xcite . following a suggestion at the 27th international conference on low temperature physics , we refer to this charge relaxation resistance as the bttiker resistance  @xcite .",
    "the resistance quantization is robust against interactions in the cavity  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the capacitance , and thus the charge relaxation time , depend on the qpc transmission .    the physics changes if a large gate voltage is applied  @xcite . for a square pulse excitation ,",
    "the charge relaxation resistance approaches the qpc resistance and the capacitance becomes independent of the transmission  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the capacitor can be operated as an on - demand source of coherent electrons . by lifting a filled level of the capacitor above the fermi energy of the external reservoir",
    ", a single electron can be emitted from the capacitor .",
    "as the level is lowered , the capacitor is refilled with an electron . by doing so periodically , a quantized ac current",
    "can be generated  @xcite .",
    "this has paved the way for quantum optics experiments with electrons  @xcite .",
    "in particular , hanbury - brown - twiss  @xcite and hong - ou - mandel  @xcite interferometry with electrons has been realized .    in this article",
    "we characterize the mesoscopic capacitor operated as a coherent single - electron emitter by calculating the distribution of electron waiting times  @xcite . as such ,",
    "our work combines two of markus bttiker s interests : the mesoscopic capacitor and electron waiting times .",
    "the electronic waiting time distribution ( wtd ) has previously been evaluated for the driven mesoscopic capacitor using a rate equation description  @xcite . here",
    "we address the problem using two complementary methods .",
    "we use a wave packet approach to evaluate the wtd analytically together with a method based on floquet scattering theory for numerically exact calculations . in the appropriate parameter ranges",
    ", we recover the results obtained from the rate equation description .",
    "in addition , the floquet calculations allow us to consider parameter regimes which so far have not been accessible .",
    "the results presented here may be tested in future experiments on the mesoscopic capacitor .",
    "the remainder of the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : scat ] , we discuss the mesoscopic capacitor and its description based on floquet scattering theory .",
    "section  [ sec : wtd ] is devoted to the theory of electronic wtds . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wavepacket ] we use a wave packet description to analytically evaluate the wtd and the joint distribution of waiting times . in sec .",
    "[ sec : floquet ] we perform full floquet scattering theory calculations of the wtd . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions .    .",
    "by applying a time - dependent voltage @xmath7 to the top gate of the capacitor ( in grey ) the levels of the capacitor are shifted up and down .",
    "if a filled level is moved above the fermi energy of the external reservoir , the capacitor can emit an electron into the edge state .",
    "the empty level is then refilled by an electron as the level is moved below the fermi energy .",
    "this leads to exponential current pulses ( in blue ) with alternating signs in the outgoing edge state . ]",
    "in this section we describe the mesoscopic capacitor using non - interacting scattering theory @xcite . this approach can account for many experimental observations .",
    "the capacitor is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : mescap ] .",
    "electrons propagate along chiral edge states that form when a two - dimensional electron gas is subject to a strong magnetic field .",
    "a small loop is tunnel coupled to an edge state via a qpc .",
    "the loop constitutes one plate of the capacitor .",
    "the other plate is a top - gate with potential @xmath7 .",
    "an electron traveling along the edge state can either be reflected on the capacitor and continue its motion along the edge , or it can be transmitted into the capacitor and make several turns inside the loop before eventually escaping . since there is only a single incoming and outgoing channel , the scattering matrix of the capacitor is just a complex number of unit length which can be obtained by summing up the quantum mechanical amplitudes for all possible scattering paths .",
    "we first consider the capacitor with a constant top - gate potential @xmath8 .",
    "the reflection amplitude is then @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the reflection amplitude of the qpc ( here chosen to be real ) , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the time it takes an electron with fermi velocity @xmath13 to complete one turn in the loop of circumference @xmath14 . in this case , no ( additional ) current is generated in the outgoing edge state .",
    "to generate an ac current , the top - gate potential must be time - dependent . to see this",
    ", it is instructive to consider the density of states of the capacitor without driving @xmath15 the density of states consists of a series of lorentzian peaks with spacing @xmath16 and widths @xmath17 a time - dependent potential @xmath7 will shift the positions of the levels .",
    "if a filled level is moved above the fermi energy , an electron can escape the capacitor and when an empty level is moved below the fermi energy , an electron can be absorbed , or equivalently , a hole be emitted from the capacitor . moving an energy level periodically above and below the fermi energy will thus result in the periodic emission of a single electron followed by a single hole .",
    "if this is done adiabatically , the lorentzian width of the level determines the wave - function of the emitted particles and the current consists of a series of lorentzian pulses with alternating signs  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , a square - shaped potential has been applied to a capacitor with period @xmath18 and peak - to - peak amplitude equal to the level spacing @xmath19  @xcite . within one period ,",
    "the potential has the form @xmath20 the current pulses then have the shape of decaying exponentials with alternating signs .",
    "we focus throughout this work on this square - shaped potential .    to describe a periodic potential we use floquet scattering theory  @xcite .",
    "we start by noting that an electron that completes @xmath21 turns in the capacitor picks up the phase  @xcite @xmath22 upon leaving the capacitor at time @xmath23 . by substituting this expression for the static phase @xmath24 in the first line of eq .",
    ", we obtain the mixed energy - time representation of the scattering amplitude @xmath25 for electrons that enter the capacitor with energy @xmath26 to leave it at time @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "since the potential is periodic , @xmath27 , we can expand the scattering phase in a fourier series as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the frequency of the driving .",
    "in addition , by fourier transforming @xmath25 as @xmath30 we obtain the floquet scattering matrix @xmath31 where we have defined the energies @xmath32 the floquet scattering matrix contains the quantum mechanical amplitudes for an electron with energy @xmath33 to change its energy to @xmath26 as a result of the scattering process . due to the periodicity of the potential , an electron can only absorb or emit energy in units of the energy quantum @xmath34 .",
    "equation   is valid for an arbitrary periodic top - gate potential @xmath7 expressed in terms of its fourier components @xmath35 .",
    "the floquet scattering matrix relates the annihilation operators @xmath36 of the outgoing electrons to the annihilation operators @xmath37 of the incoming electrons as @xmath38 with this expression one may calculate the time - dependent current or the finite - frequency noise of the capacitor @xcite .",
    "the mesoscopic capacitor works best as a single - electron source if the density of states is symmetric around the fermi energy . in this case ,",
    "an analytic expression for the floquet scattering matrix has been derived  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the charge relaxation resistance @xmath39 equals the resistance of the qpc for small transmissions  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the capacitance becomes independent of the transmission @xmath40 the dwell ( or relaxation ) time of the capacitor reads @xmath41 the capacitor is expected to operate as a nearly perfect single - electron emitter if the dwell time is ( much ) shorter than the period , @xmath42 . in this case , a single electron and a single hole should be emitted in almost every cycle .",
    "however , even under these optimal conditions , there can be noise at finite frequencies associated with the uncertainty of the emission time within a period and the shape of the wave packets .",
    "this type of noise has been investigated theoretically and experimentally in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if the qpc transmission is too low , the dwell time can become comparable to the period . in this case",
    ", cycle - missing events may occur , where the capacitor fails to emit an electron within a period or an empty level is not refilled .",
    "an electron and a hole will then be missing from the otherwise periodic stream of particles .",
    "several methods have been employed to assess the accuracy of the mesoscopic capacitor as a single - electron source .",
    "these include analyzing the finite - frequency noise @xcite or the full counting statistics of emitted charge @xcite . in a complementary approach , one considers the distribution of electron waiting times @xcite . this will be our focus in this paper .",
    "the electron waiting time @xmath43 is the time that passes between two subsequent electrons being emitted by the capacitor .",
    "this is a fluctuating quantity which can be described by a probability distribution @xmath44 .",
    "as we will see , the distribution of waiting times provides us with a useful characterization of the mesoscopic capacitor operating as a single - particle emitter . in earlier work ,",
    "a rate equation description was used to evaluate the wtd @xcite . here",
    "we address the problem using two complementary approaches .",
    "first , we calculate the wtd analytically based on the wave packets emitted by the capacitor .",
    "these results are then compared with full floquet scattering calculations , employing the methods developed in refs .",
    "the theoretical framework for calculating wtds using scattering theory is described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , and in this section we only provide a brief summary .    to evaluate the wtd , we relate it to the idle time probability ( itp ) .",
    "this is the probability that no electrons are emitted during a given time interval @xmath45 $ ] . for time - dependent problems the itp , @xmath46 , depends both on @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "however , for a periodic process , the itp depends only on the length of the interval @xmath49 , if the starting point @xmath47 is chosen randomly , and it can be written as @xmath50 the wtd can then be expressed as @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mean waiting time .",
    "similar relations hold for the level spacing statistics of random matrices @xcite .",
    "the itp can be evaluated by introducing the operator @xmath53 where @xmath54 annihilates electrons at position @xmath55 .",
    "the itp can then be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes normal - ordering of operators with respect to the fermi sea as we are only interested in electrons emitted above the fermi level @xcite .",
    "here we have made use of the linear dispersion relation close to the fermi level , implying that the probability of finding no emitted electrons in the spatial interval @xmath58 $ ] after the capacitor is equal to the probability that the capacitor has not emitted any electrons in the temporal interval  @xmath45 $ ] . to ease the notation",
    ", we now set @xmath59 .    the derivatives in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wtditp ] ) have a physical meaning . to see this",
    ", we differentiate the itp in eq .   with respect to the end time @xmath48 and",
    "define @xmath60 comparing this expression with eq .",
    ", we see that the expectation value of the normal - ordered exponential is now taken with respect to the many - body state with an electron removed at @xmath48 .",
    "this is the probability distribution for an electron to be emitted at time @xmath48 , given that no electrons were emitted in the interval @xmath61 .",
    "such a distribution is also known as a first passage time distribution .",
    "the derivative with respect to @xmath48 corresponds to the emission of an electron from the capacitor at time @xmath48 .",
    "again , for a periodic process where the starting point is chosen randomly , we can define a first passage time distribution @xmath62 that depends only on the interval length @xmath49 .    following a similar line of arguments",
    ", we can express the wtd as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the average electronic current emitted by the capacitor at time @xmath47 .",
    "the expectation value yields the joint probability density for the emission of an electron both at  @xmath47 and at  @xmath48 with no electrons being emitted in between . dividing this quantity by @xmath64",
    ", we recover the conditional probability density for the first emission of an electron to occur at time @xmath48 following an emission at time @xmath47 .",
    "the wtd corresponding to eq .   can then be expressed as @xmath65    building on this principle , we can also evaluate the joint distribution of successive waiting times following our recent work described in ref .",
    "@xcite . to this end",

    "( [ eq : qoperator ] ) . for a periodically driven conductor ,",
    "we obtain the joint distribution of subsequent waiting times just as in eq .  , @xmath73    the expressions presented in this section form the basis for our calculations of the distribution of electron waiting times using floquet scattering theory .",
    "however , as we will now see they can also be used to evaluate the wtd for the mesoscopic capacitor using a wave packet description .",
    "in this section we calculate the wtd for the mesoscopic capacitor based on the emitted wave packets .",
    "we consider the waiting time between emitted electrons , noting that the emitted holes in principle can also be included  @xcite .",
    "we first discuss the wtd for the capacitor when operated under ideal conditions before including unwanted effects like cycle - missing events .",
    "when operated under ideal conditions , the mesoscopic capacitor emits exactly one electron per cycle with a squared wave packet of the form @xmath74 $ ] , when the energy level of the capacitor is above the fermi level of the edge state .",
    "the dwell time @xmath75 is defined in eq .",
    "and we have ignored any possible fine structures on the time scale of @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the normalization factor @xmath77 ensures that the squared wave function integrates to unity .",

    "the wtd gives a particularly clear picture of the emission of electrons from the capacitor .",
    "the distribution is peaked around one period of the driving with the width governed by the uncertainty in the exact time of emission within each period .",
    "the symmetry around @xmath93 reflects that every electron is emitted with the same wave function .",

    "looking at the side panels we see that the joint wtd does not factorize into a product of the individual wtds , @xmath107 .",
    "this shows us that subsequent electron waiting times are correlated if we have no knowledge about the external driving of the capacitor .",
    "these classical correlations are due to the regular emission of electrons .      next",

    "it may then happen that more than one electron is lifted above the fermi level within one period , giving rise to the satellite peak at @xmath146 , similarly to what has been found for lorentzian - shaped voltage pulses  @xcite .    .",
    "the different curves have been shifted vertically for the sake of better visibility .",
    "these results can not be captured by the wave packet approach . ]",
    "we have investigated the distribution of waiting times between the emissions of single electrons from a driven mesoscopic capacitor . using a wave packet description",
    "we have calculated analytically both the electronic waiting time distribution and the joint distribution of subsequent electron waiting times . in the appropriate parameter ranges ,",
    "these results compare well with full numerical calculations based on floquet scattering theory .",
    "the floquet method allows us also to calculate waiting time distributions as the transmission between the capacitor and the external reservoirs approaches unity .",
    "the agreement between the wave packet approach and the floquet scattering theory at low transmissions may indicate that the dynamics in this regime essentially is determined by the charge occupation of the capacitor .",
    "as such , an indirect measurement of the wtd might be possible by monitoring the charge on the capacitor using for instance an additional quantum point contact .",
    "we thank m.  albert , g.  fve , g.  haack , m.  moskalets , and p.  samuelsson for useful discussions .",
