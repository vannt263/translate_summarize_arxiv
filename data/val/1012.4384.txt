    "at the beginning of the 20th century `` mechanics had not yet lost its place as the central subject within physics , although it was on the verge of losing it '' @xcite .",
    "fifty years later classical mechanics was considered , by the majority of physicists , a closed field from which one could not expect new challenges , specially in fundamental issues .",
    "but from then on , fresh mathematical results , together with additional numerical data obtained by high - speed computers , revived a field of knowledge related to non - linear dynamics and irregular behaviour of deterministic systems . a field that had begun at the end of the 19th century mainly by the works of henri poincar in his attempt to develop a convergent perturbation theory of planetary orbits .",
    "the solar system , despite its complexity , shows an extremely regular behaviour which can be predicted very accurately for short periods of time .",
    "this is due , in part , to the weakness of the gravitational force , but also because kepler s two - body problem is completely integrable , despite the fact that any gravitational system of three or more bodies is not ( let us imagine for a moment the difficulties of guessing the law of gravitation had the earth been orbiting around a double star ) .",
    "the newtonian deduction of kepler s laws is based precisely on the properties of the integrable system of two bodies .",
    "nevertheless , the dynamical interactions of the many bodies that form the solar system necessarily lead us to consider deviations to the predictions based on kepler s laws .",
    "this makes us wonder : why does the solar system behave in such a regular way ? or , as in the inquiry of j. k. moser : is the solar system stable ?",
    "@xcite that is , will it follow in the future the order that we presently observe ?",
    "even today these questions do not have a complete and satisfactory answer .    for more than three hundred years , since the time of newton , the evolution and stability of mechanical systems , and specially that of the solar system , have been central to physics and mathematics . during the 18th century , euler , lagrange and laplace made substantial developments by predicting changes in the planetary orbits due to small perturbations , establishing a framework for the study of global stability .",
    "all of this culminated in the 19th century works of hamilton and jacobi who reformulated the lagrangian formalism of classical mechanics in terms of the phase space , a step which proved to be most fruitful for the developments of both statistical and quantum mechanics .",
    "these successes consolidated the idea of classical determinism .",
    "however , at the turn of the 19th century , the works of poincar not only closed the door to an age but generated the first serious fracture in the philosophical conception of determinism .",
    "these works showed the impossibility of proving the convergence of perturbation series and , therefore , central questions , as the stability of the solar system , remained unanswered .",
    "poincar ' e was thus the first to study what much later has been called ( apparently by j. yorke in 1975 ) _",
    "chaos_.    a plain , albeit not simplistic , definition of chaos is `` chaos is the complicated temporal evolution of simple systems '' @xcite .",
    "thus , and contrary to common thinking , chaos is not spatial and static disorder but a characteristic of certain motions .",
    "it is essentially a dynamical concept , in which two initially close trajectories may be divergent after a finite time .",
    "chaos may appear in a variety of fields : physics , chemical reactions , the spread of illnesses , internet , economics and , of course , in planetary motions @xcite .",
    "for contrary to intuition , chaotic behaviour is not an exclusive property of dissipative or random systems but of conservative and deterministic systems as well .",
    "focusing on conservative systems we will show that small denominators giving place to resonances are associated to the appearance of chaos , and that due to this irregular behaviour , it seems impossible to predict the long - term evolution of nonintegrable systems ( the vast majority of mechanical systems ) using perturbation techniques .",
    "since the end of the 19th century there was no remarkable advance and this fundamental question was practically forgotten until 1954 , when a. n. kolmogorov gave a sketch of the proof that most trajectories of nonintegrable conservative systems are quasiperiodic and that one can obtain them through a convergent perturbation development . in the 1960 s ,",
    "v. i. arnold and j. k. moser gave a more formal and rigorous proof of this result , known as the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theorem .",
    "in the coming sections we will explain and develop these ideas , stressing physical aspects , rather than mathematical concepts and technicalities , of which there are plenty in a field that was the starting point of modern mathematical developments such as topology . in this way the paper is intended as a comprehensive and intuitive introduction to deterministic chaos which",
    ", we hope , will be useful for either students and instructors .",
    "the quintessential mechanical system , to which most physical systems are reduced , consists in a collection of mass points interacting between them .",
    "experience shows that the state of the system is completely determined by the set of positions and velocities of all its particles .",
    "the reference system chosen to describe positions and velocities needs not be cartesian .",
    "thus , in the lagrangian formulation of mechanics , the representation of the state of the system is obtained through generalized coordinates @xmath0 and velocities @xmath1 .",
    "the minimum number of generalized coordinates needed to describe the state of the system is called the number of degrees of freedom . in",
    "what follows we will use bold letters to design vectors .",
    "accordingly , the set of all positions is represented by the vector @xmath2 and the set of all velocities by @xmath3 .",
    "the laws of mechanics are those that determine the motion of the system by providing the time evolution of the positions , @xmath4 , and the velocities , @xmath5 , of all its components . therefore , the main problem is the determination of how the state of the system evolves with time .",
    "there have been several approaches to achieve this goal .",
    "the first one was based on newton s laws which directly emanate from experience .",
    "this approach was subsequently refined and generalized by the lagrangian and hamiltonian formulations , being the latter the most appropriate for the present development .    in the hamiltonian formulation ,",
    "the description of the state the system is also given by generalized coordinates @xmath2 but instead of velocities by generalized momenta @xmath6 .",
    "the main problem is then finding the time evolution of these quantities , in other words , the knowledge of the functions @xmath4 and @xmath7 which give the temporal evolution of coordinates and momenta .",
    "this is achieved by solving the following set of @xmath8 first - order differential equations known as _ hamilton equations _",
    "@xcite : @xmath9 where the function @xmath10 is the hamiltonian which , for inertial reference frames , coincides with the total energy of the system @xcite . in ( [ 1 - 4 ] )",
    "we have used the notation : @xmath11 to denote the gradient of @xmath12 with respect to @xmath13 and analogously for @xmath14 .    for those readers not familiar with the hamiltonian formulation",
    ", it may be useful to recall that for the three dimensional motion of a particle of mass @xmath15 inside a conservative field of potential energy @xmath16 , the energy ( i.e. , the hamiltonian ) is @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in this case",
    "hamilton equations ( [ 1 - 4 ] ) read @xmath20 which coincide with newton s second law .    in the hamiltonian formulation ,",
    "the state of a system with @xmath21 degrees of freedom is described by a single point @xmath22 of a space of dimension @xmath8 called _",
    "phase space_. hence , starting at @xmath23 from an initial point @xmath24 , the state of the system in a later time @xmath25 will be given by the point @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the equations of motion , that is , the solutions of hamilton equations ( [ 1 - 4 ] ) with the initial conditions @xmath29 and @xmath30 . the trajectory described by the point @xmath31 as time progresses",
    "is called the _ phase - space trajectory _ of the system .",
    "one of the advantages of the hamiltonian formulation is that we can evaluate the time evolution of any property of the system without having to know the form of the equations of motion .",
    "that is to say , without solving hamilton equations which is usually quite involved .",
    "let us assume that a given property of the system ( for instance , the energy or the angular momentum ) can be represented by a function , @xmath32 , of the state of the system and the time .",
    "how does @xmath33 change when the state @xmath34 evolves with time ?",
    "the answer is simple and reads @xcite @xmath35 , \\label{1 - 5}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 $ ] is the _ poisson bracket _ defined by @xmath37=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_i } \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial p_i}-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_i } \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial q_i}\\right ) .",

    ". a direct generalization of ( [ 1 - 6 ] ) gives @xmath46=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_i } \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_i}-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_i } \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial q_i}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{poisson}\\ ] ] from this definition one easily obtains a series of properties satisfied by the poisson bracket .",
    "properties that endow the set of dynamical functions with an algebraic structure called _ lie algebra_. we will not proceed here with this mathematical development and address the interested reader to specialized texts ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    for the special case that @xmath33 and @xmath47 are any of the @xmath48 s or @xmath49 s , definition ( [ poisson ] ) gives @xmath50=[p_i , p_j]=0 , \\qquad [ q_i , p_j]=\\delta_{ij}. \\label{canonical}\\ ] ] this is the condition for any set of variables @xmath51 to be a canonical set , i.e. , that they satisfy hamilton equations with some hamiltonian @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "perhaps the greatest advantage of the hamiltonian formulation is that it allows for transformations of variables preserving the form of hamilton equations .",
    "there are several ways , all of them equivalent , to define these kind of transformations .",
    "we choose the following :    we say that the change of variables , @xmath52 , given by the equations @xmath53 is a _ canonical transformation _",
    "if the infinitesimal quantities @xmath54 and @xmath55 differ only in the total differential of a scalar function @xmath56 : @xmath57 the function @xmath56 is called the _ generating function _ of the canonical transformation .",
    "observe that , because of ( [ canonical_1 ] ) , out of the four sets of variables : @xmath58 and @xmath59 , involved in a canonical transformation , only two of them are actually independent .",
    "the generating function @xmath56 will thus depend upon the two sets of variables chosen to be independent , and also on @xmath25 in the case of a time - dependent canonical transformation .",
    "one convenient choice , among others , consists in assuming that the generating function depends on the original coordinates and the transformed momenta , i.e , @xmath60 combining this assumption with condition ( [ canonical_2 ] ) one can easily show that the equations of the canonical transformation are given by @xcite @xmath61    it can be shown @xcite that after a canonical transformation the hamilton equations preserve the form : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the transformed hamiltonian .",
    "note that for time - independent canonical transformations @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , so that the transformed hamiltonian coincides with the original one ( the latter being written in terms of the transformed variables ) .",
    "let us observe that _ any _ arbitrary function @xmath56 generates _ some _ canonical transformation .",
    "this is quite remarkable , because it implies the freedom of writing hamilton equations that is , the laws of motion in any convenient way only by the introduction of a given function @xmath56 .",
    "following this line of reasoning we might look for a canonical transformation such that the equations of motion would be the simplest ones .",
    "in other words , what would it be the generating function of the canonical transformation such that the transformed @xmath66s and @xmath67s are constants ? note that , if we could find this transformation , then we would have solved the problem of motion , for the equations of the transformation ( [ canonical_1 ] ) ( or , equivalently , ( [ canonical_3 ] ) ) give the equations of motion @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where the new coordinates and momenta @xmath70 and @xmath71 are constants determined by the initial conditions .",
    "if the transformed variables are constant , their time derivatives are zero , and from ( [ hamilton_trans ] ) we see that @xmath72 . accordingly , the transformed hamiltonian @xmath73 must be independent of the coordinates and momenta and , at most , a function of time , which , for simplicity , we choose to be zero .",
    "therefore , if in ( [ 1 - 6a ] ) we set @xmath74 , and remembering that @xmath75 ( cf ( [ canonical_3 ] ) ) , we see that the generating function of the canonical transformation @xmath76 obeys the equation @xmath77 called the _ hamilton - jacobi equation_. this is a first - order nonlinear partial differential equation and it provides an alternative procedure for finding the equations of motion @xcite .",
    "in classical mechanics one of the most fundamental questions is the _ integrability _ of a given system . here",
    "integrability does not mean whether or not the hamilton equations can be solved in some particular way .",
    "in fact , as a set of @xmath8 differential equations , they can always be solved ( at least numerically ) under very general conditions given by the cauchy theorem @xcite .",
    "the concept of integrability refers to _ the existence of constants of motion _ ( also called _",
    "integrals _ and hence the name ) which are responsible for the regular evolution of the phase - space trajectories of the system in well - defined regions of phase space . due to its importance ,",
    "let us recall again that a constant of motion is any function of positions and momenta which does not change with time whereas the @xmath48 s and @xmath49 s do .",
    "there are several equivalent definitions of integrability @xcite , all of them underlying , in one way or another , the fact that _ hamilton equations ( or the hamilton - jacobi equation ) are integrated in terms of as many constants of motion as degrees of freedom_. one of these definitions , which turns out to be convenient for our purposes , is the following :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the hamiltonian of a system with @xmath21 degrees of freedom is integrable if there exist @xmath21 independent constants , or integrals of motion , @xmath78 @xmath79 , which are in `` involution '' , meaning that the quantities @xmath80 satisfy @xmath81=0 \\label{2 - 0}\\ ] ] @xmath82 where @xmath83 $ ] is the poisson bracket defined as in _",

    "momenta the integration of hamilton equations is immediate .",
    "this is essentially the content of a theorem attributed to liouville @xcite and what ultimately justifies the above definition of integrability ( see [ appena0 ] for a more complete discussion ) .",
    "unfortunately , the existence of @xmath21 integrals of motion in involution is the exception more than the rule .",
    "poincar proved , more than a century ago , that most mechanical systems only have the energy as a constant of motion .",
    "therefore , _ most systems with more than one degree of freedom are not integrable_.    a paradigmatic example is provided by a closed @xmath85-body system , i.e. , a set of @xmath85 point particles interacting with each other without external forces acting on them .",
    "the @xmath85 body system has @xmath86 degrees of freedom ( @xmath87 for each particle ) and only @xmath88 integrals of motion .",
    "these are :    * the three components of the total momentum @xmath89 * the three components of the motion of the center of mass ( @xmath90 is the total mass of the system ) @xmath91 * the three components of the total angular momentum @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the relative angular momentum . *",
    "the energy @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the relative kinetic energy and @xmath96 is the potential energy .",
    "from these ten integrals _ only six of them are independent and in involution _ : the three components of the total momentum @xmath97 , the square of the relative angular momentum @xmath98 , the third component of the relative angular momentum @xmath99 , and the total relative energy @xmath100 @xcite .    when @xmath101 , _ the two - body problem _ , there are @xmath102 degrees of freedom and the problem is integrable . however , when @xmath103 , _ the three - body problem _ , there are @xmath104 degrees of freedom but only @xmath102 independent constants of motion in involution ; whence , the three - body problem ( for example , the system sun - earth - moon ) is not integrable",
    ".      let us first focus on integrable systems and postpone nonintegrable systems for later sections .",
    "a first and most important consequence of the existence of @xmath21 involution constants @xmath80 is that the trajectories of the system can not pass through all points of the phase space .",
    "this is due to the fact that all trajectories are confined to move in a @xmath21 dimensional manifold @xmath90 determined by the constants of motion and embedded in the phase space of dimension @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , the manifold @xmath90 is defined by the set of @xmath21 algebraic equations : @xmath105 where @xmath106 are arbitrary constants .",
    "consequently , _ the phase - space trajectories never leave _",
    "@xmath90 because otherwise the conservation laws would be violated .",
    "note that the manifold @xmath90 depends on the particular value of the constants of motion and , since the latter depend on the choice of the initial state of the system , we see that @xmath90 is fixed by the initial conditions .    in what follows we will assume that the motion of the system is bounded ( recall , for instance , the planetary motion ) .",
    "as a consequence of this , the manifold @xmath90 must be bounded as well .",
    "in fact , it can be shown , that @xmath90 is a compact ( closed and bounded ) manifold @xcite .",

    "this is quite remarkable since , for integrable hamiltonians described by action - angle variables , to obtain the frequencies of the motion it is not necessary to integrate hamilton equations , it suffices to take the derivative of the hamiltonian with respect to the actions , a much easier task indeed .",

    "this allows us to expand the perturbation as a fourier series in the angular variables .",
    "therefore , following the notation of section [ subsec4 - 1 ] , we see that ( [ 5 - 1 ] ) can be written as @xmath251 where @xmath252 @xmath253 and @xmath254 ( @xmath255 ) .",

    "unfortunately , this procedure can not be done exactly .",

    "hence we get two series whose convergence is uncertain . for one hand , we have fourier series that can not converge due to internal resonances which lead to the famous problem of `` small denominators '' . on the other hand , far from resonant frequencies and also because of small divisors , it is quite unclear that the perturbation series in @xmath250 converge .",
    "in fact , poincar proved that all these series do not lead to a convergent representation of the perturbed problem @xcite .",
    "consequently , fundamental questions , as the long - time stability of planetary orbits in the solar system , could not be answered in a satisfactory way .",
    "let us remind moser s query and ask again : is the solar system stable ?",
    "at the end of the 19th century , the general consensus was that the addition of even the smallest perturbation would render any conservative system nonintegrable , and that any phase - space trajectory would densely explore the energy shell in a chaotic manner .",
    "this was the first crack in classical certainty and a severe blow on classical thinking .",
    "all efforts and attempts by some of the finest mathematicians and physicists of the time failed to solve the small divisor problem .",
    "poincar called it the `` fundamental problem of classical mechanics '' and seemed to be an unsurmountable obstacle .",
    "thus , around the beginning of the 20th century , this field of research dropped off and questions concerning long - time planetary stability were almost forgotten in mainstream research .    the breakthrough came in 1954 , when a. n. kolmogorov @xcite devised a way of obtaining a theory of canonical perturbations which is rapidly convergent and appropriate to nonresonant tori .",
    "kolmogorov s new idea was rigorously proved by v. i. arnold in 1961 @xcite and , independently , by j. k. moser in 1962 @xcite .",

    "kolmogorov s idea was that , far from resonant frequencies , it is possible to construct a perturbation series _ in even powers of _ @xmath250 .",
    "this leads to a fast convergent ( `` superconvergent '' ) perturbation series with the overall result that , for most initial conditions , the motion generated by the hamiltonian ( [ 6 - 1 ] ) remains quasiperiodic , that is , confined to reside on certain surfaces which resemble slightly deformed tori ; while the complementary of this regular motion that is , the chaotic motion has a small lebesgue measure if @xmath250 is small . in other words , the set of chaotic trajectories is negligible as @xmath305 .    in order to be more precise in the formulation of the theorem",

    "this means that , for almost all ( but _ not _ all ) nonresonant frequencies , the phase - space trajectories are regular and not chaotic as far as @xmath250 is small enough ( the theorem does not tell how small @xmath250 has to be ) .",
    "moreover , the theorem also proves that the measure of the set of points in phase space which do not lie on any surface @xmath317 tends to zero when @xmath305 .",
    "that is to say , the probability of randomly choosing initial conditions not leading to motion on stable surfaces @xmath317 is vanishingly small as @xmath305 .",
    "this has momentous consequences for the stability of planetary orbits because it is extremely unlikely ( though not impossible ) that a given celestial body is located in some unstable ( i.e. , resonant ) region ( see , nonetheless , the next section ) .",
    "therefore , we see that , under the conditions of the theorem , small perturbations do not destroy invariant tori @xmath183 but only deform them . on these deformed tori , called _",
    "kam surfaces _ , the motion is regular and not chaotic .",
    "the rigorous proof of the theorem is highly technical and we will not give it here .",
    "there are , however , more accessible derivations such , for instance , that of r. barrar @xcite to which we refer the interested reader ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned above the clue of the proof , discovered by kolmogorov , is a superconvergent perturbation method similar to the old newton - raphson technique for solving algebraic equations @xcite .",
    "kam tori @xmath317 are determined by nonresonant frequencies @xmath312 and on these deformed tori the motion is not chaotic .",
    "but , what about resonant tori ? what happens to them ?",
    "in other words , what is the fate , when a perturbation is added , of those tori defined by a rational relation of frequencies ? it can be shown that resonances completely destroy resonant tori @xcite .",
    "consequently the trajectories on these tori which , remember , in the absence of perturbation follow well defined closed and periodic curves on them lose their bounds and wander through the phase space ( in fact , only through the subspace given by the surface of constant energy ) .",
    "therefore , motion on resonant tori becomes completely irregular and unstable .",
    "this is an example of the so - called _ hard chaos _",
    ", as opposed to _ soft - chaos _ which relates to the motion near kam surfaces @xcite ( see also next section ) .",
    "fortunately , as kam theorem proves , the set of resonant tori , on which regular motion is destroyed , has a vanishingly small measure as long as the perturbation is small .",
    "equivalently , the remaining slightly deformed tori where the motion is still regular , have a measure close to @xmath318 if @xmath250 is small .",
    "this means that most tori are not destroyed for small perturbations and kam surfaces almost densely fill the energy shell and between them there appear `` islands '' with chaotic motion .",
    "this results in poincar sections which are extraordinarily complex and that some authors picture as in fig .",
    "in this closing section we briefly outline some additional developments and applications of the theory .      as kam theorem proves ,",
    "the energy shell of a conservative and nonintegrable hamiltonian of the form @xmath319 where @xmath248 is integrable and @xmath250 is small , is densely filled with kam surfaces on which phase - space trajectories are fairly regular",
    ". however , outside kam tori trajectories are random . in order to analyze these chaotic trajectories",
    "we must distinguish among the cases of two and more than two degrees of freedom .",
    "let us recall that , for integrable conservative systems with @xmath21 degrees of freedom , the phase space is @xmath8 dimensional , the energy shell is @xmath320 dimensional and invariant tori are @xmath21 dimensional .",
    "hence , for @xmath321 , the two dimensional tori are embedded in the three - dimensional energy surface .",
    "this means that any closed surface , such as a torus , divide the energy shell into an inner region and an outer region .",
    "the same applies to kam tori of conservative nonintegrable system with @xmath118 degrees of freedom .",
    "accordingly , any chaotic trajectory , located in the interspace between two tori , can not escape from it .",
    "no matter how complicated its motion is , the trajectory never leaves the region and the action variables remain close to their initial values .",
    "this is another aspect of the soft - chaos mentioned above , for there exists certain stability of motion because kam surfaces densely populate the energy shell and are , therefore , very close to each other .",
    "however , for @xmath322 chaotic trajectories located in regions between tori can escape to other regions of the energy shell ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "thus , for instance , if @xmath323 the energy shell is @xmath324 dimensional , kam surfaces @xmath87 dimensional , and chaotic trajectories have two additional dimensions to wander through .",
    "hence , _ for @xmath322 the existence of kam surfaces does not guarantee the stability of motion _ , as two trajectories which are initially very close to each other can be very distant after a finite period of time .",
    "this phenomenon , that exists for arbitrarily small perturbations , is known as _ arnold diffusion _ and only appears in systems with more than @xmath118 degrees of freedom .",
    "the set of wandering trajectories resulting from it constitute the so - called _",
    "arnold web_. there have been several attempts to determine the average speed of the spreading of trajectories defined as @xmath325 , where @xmath326 .",
    "several theoretical models and numerical studies seem to indicate that this velocity is very small .",
    "some models predict that @xcite @xmath327 which means , that for small @xmath250 , the action at time @xmath25 , @xmath328 , remains close to its initial value , @xmath329 , for a very long time @xmath330 . in other words ,",
    "the average diffusion velocity is of the order @xmath331 which is exponentially small and practically undetectable if @xmath247 .",
    "let us return to the problem of the long - time stability of the solar system , one of the major challenges of mechanics for more than three centuries . as we know , the solar system is a nonintegrable many - body problem which , to first approximation , can be considered conservative . the key point is whether planetary motions are quasiperiodic or random .",
    "the solar system is too complicated and a direct application of the kam theorem does not bring practical results . on the other hand , planet orbits exhibit great regularity and until recently it was thought that the solar system evolves quasiperiodically . in spite of this",
    ", there seems to be some evidence that this may not be the case .    in 1857",
    "the american astronomer d. kirkwood discovered a series of discontinuities in the distribution of main - belt asteroids which circle the sun and lie between mars and jupiter .",
    "there are regions where there is a depletion in the number of asteroids .",
    "these regions are called _",
    "kirkwood gaps_. one of the most plausible explanation for them has been given by s. f. dermott and c. d. murray @xcite , who in 1983 proposed that the gaps are due to resonances in the three - body problem of the sun , jupiter , and the individual asteroids @xcite .",
    "that is , jupiter perturbs the asteroid s almost keplerian orbit around the sun and creates resonances in the asteroid s phase space .",
    "the location of the observed gaps are found to be very close to the resonant surfaces of jupiter and the asteroids , which would agree with kam theory about the destruction of resonant tori .",
    "it has also been argued that the mechanism of arnold diffusion might be responsible for removing asteroids from the gap regions and force some of them to collide with mars @xcite .",
    "let us finally mention that there seems to be some numerical evidence that the long - term motion of the former planet pluto is chaotic and also that of some of the main planets of the solar system @xcite .",
    "all these results seem to indicate that the long - time motion of the solar system may be chaotic and , to some extent , unpredictable .",
    "let us finish this exposition by giving a very brief view on the possible manifestation of chaotic behaviour in quantum systems .",
    "if one naively tries to extend , in a direct manner , the concepts of regular and chaotic trajectories to quantum systems , one is immediately faced with an unsurmountable difficulty : due to heisenberg s uncertainty principle , between canonically conjugated variables , it makes no sense to define trajectories in the quantum phase space .",
    "in fact , the phase space of any system of @xmath21 degrees of freedom is divided in cells of volume @xmath332 ( @xmath333 is planck s constant ) and one can not determine at which point inside a given cell the system is .",
    "this renders the construction of phase - space trajectories meaningless .",
    "therefore , the notion of invariant tori , over which the trajectories of integrable systems stay , also loses its meaning in the quantum world .",
    "the problem of the quantization of nonintegrable hamiltonians can be traced back to the early days of the old quantum theory @xcite ( see @xcite for a thorough review ) .",
    "however , strictly speaking , there is no such think as `` quantum chaos '' , although there have been detected some peculiar effects in quantum systems whose classical counterparts correspond to chaotic systems . quoting m. gutzwiller : `` the term ` quantum chaos ' serves more to describe a conundrum than to define a well - posed problem '' @xcite .",
    "what is understood by quantum chaos is essentially the relation between classical chaotic systems and their quantum counterparts .",
    "let us recall that in quantum mechanics , the state of the system is not specified by a point @xmath334 of the phase space but by a wave function @xmath335 giving the probability of finding the system at position @xmath13 in time @xmath25 .",
    "however , this wave - like character of quantum systems implies a smooth nature . how can the irregular character of classical chaos be reconciled with the smooth and wave - like nature of phenomena on the atomic scale governed by quantum mechanics ?",
    "@xcite . what are , therefore , the quantum manifestations of chaos ? .",
    "there are several places and situations where one can look for the `` quantum signatures '' of chaos @xcite , and substantial research has been done along this direction in the last three decades .",
    "we can single out one aspect where quantum chaos is quite significant .",
    "the first place to look is in the energy levels , not a particular level but the distribution of them .",
    "thus , and somewhat paradoxically , in nonchaotic quantum systems ( i.e. , those quantum systems whose classical counterparts are integrable ) the energy levels are completely random without any correlation , while in chaotic systems the energy levels show strong correlations between them , which implies a lower degree of randomness .",
    "there are other situations in which quantum manifestations of chaos appear as , for example , in the distribution of stationary states and in electron scattering , among others .",
    "we refer the interested reader to more specialized literature for further information ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "there is a line of thought , among some philosophers and scientists , affirming that science is a construction , being scientists designers who fit as many data as possible within consistent frames .",
    "opposite to that , others believe , and this is the traditional thinking , that science is discovery and the scientist is like a detective struggling to unveil the hidden truth @xcite , `` the secret of the old one '' , as einstein put it @xcite .",
    "obviously , mainstream scientists lie somewhere in between these two extremes .    whatever the interpretation one may support , it is beyond any doubt that classical mechanics is one of the finest and most creative works that scientific endeavour can yield . in its most sophisticated form , the hamiltonian approach , classical mechanics even arrives to forecast its own limitation : the long - time unpredictable behaviour of nonintegrable systems which , as mechanics also proves , are ubiquitous in nature . the solar system , galaxies , galaxy clusters , perhaps atoms and beyond , all of them are nonintegrable .    in this review we have tried to report on this striking consequence of classical mechanics . in a world of uncertainties",
    "it all began with quantum mechanics @xcite we can add , as poincar envisaged , another one : the classical uncertainty .    partial financial support from the ministerio de ciencia e innovacin under contract no .",

    "luis navarro for useful discussions and suggestions .",

    "indeed , let us recall from ( [ canonical ] ) that any set of @xmath21 variables @xmath339 can be considered as the momenta associated to some hamiltonian if @xmath340=0 $ ] .",
    "accordingly , we make the canonical transformation @xmath341 in which the integrals of motion are the transformed momenta because the involution property grants it .",
    "the generating function of this canonical transformation is given by the indefinite integral @xmath342 where @xmath343 are the momenta written in terms of the coordinates and the constants of motion .",
    "the equations of the canonical transformation are @xmath344 and , since we deal with a time independent transformation , the transformed hamiltonian , @xmath345 , coincides with the original one written in terms of the new coordinates and momenta .",
    "in the new variables hamilton equations read @xmath346 but @xmath347 , hence @xmath348 and @xmath12 is independent of the coordinates depending only upon the constants of motion : @xmath349 therefore , from the first group of hamilton equations , we see that @xmath350 and the equations of motion read @xmath351 in this way we have completely integrated hamilton equations for the motion of the system . hence , the existence of @xmath21 independent integrals in involution leads to the complete integration of hamilton equations .",
    "the variation , @xmath153 , of the angle @xmath154 when the coordinate @xmath155 performs a complete oscillation is defined by @xmath352 which , recalling that @xmath353 ( see ( [ tc ] ) ) , we write as @xmath354 but from ( [ s ] ) we have @xmath355 ; hence @xmath356 using the definition ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) we get @xmath357 and , since @xmath358 are independent variables , we finally obtain @xmath359 which is equation ( [ delta_ij ] ) .",
    "from ( [ q(t ) ] ) we have @xmath360 whence @xmath361 and @xmath362 if and only if @xmath363 , which implies @xmath364 where @xmath365 is an arbitrary integer .",
    "this condition is equivalent to @xmath366 where @xmath367 @xmath368 is an arbitrary integer vector . in effect , if , as ( [ integer_1 ] ) demands , the scalar product of _ any _ integer vector @xmath369 with the real vector @xmath370 has to be an integer number , then necessarily @xmath371 has to be an integer vector .",
    "therefore , any coordinate ( and the same applies to momenta ) will be a periodic function of time , that is to say , there will exist a single period @xmath183 for the entire system , if all frequencies @xmath372 are integer multiples of a single frequency @xmath373 .",
    "that is @xmath374 which is equation ( [ fundamental ] ) of the main text .",
    "in order to prove equation ( [ h ] ) we have to obtain the transformed hamiltonian @xmath73 under the canonical transformation ( [ ct ] ) .",
