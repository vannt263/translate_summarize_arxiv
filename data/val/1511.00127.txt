    "one of the most extensively characterized examples of aptamer is found in telomerase at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes , where it plays an important role in gene regulation @xcite .",
    "dna loops or base - pockets consisting of guanine can interact with small molecules and proteins and thus enhance their stability , affinity and specificity @xcite .",
    "for example , adenosinemonophosphate ( amp ) binds to dna loop ( termed as binding - pocket ) with eight hydrogen bonds , that increases the stability @xcite of aptamer .",
    "it served as the target of drugs for cancer treatment @xcite .",
    "their high affinity and selectivity with target proteins make them ideal and powerful probes in biosensors and potent pharmaceuticals @xcite .",

    ", width=288 ]    a double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) can be separated in two single - stranded dna by increasing the temperature and the process is termed as dna melting .",
    "traditional spectroscopic techniques used e.g. fluorescence spectroscopy , @xmath0_vis _ spectroscopy etc . usually provide average responses for molecular interactions @xcite .",
    "single molecule force spectroscopy ( smfs ) techniques have emerged as valuable tools for measuring the molecular interactions on a single molecule level , and thus unprecedented information about the stability of bio - molecules have been achieved .",
    "for example , dna rupture induced by smfs techniques have been used to understand the strength of hydrogen bonds in nucleic acids , ligands - nucleic interaction , protein - dna interactions etc . @xcite . in dna rupture",
    "all intact base - pairs break simultaneously and two strands get separated , when a force is applied either at @xmath1 or @xmath2 ends .",
    "this force is identified as rupture force .",
    "motivated by these studies , attempts have recently been made to understand the enhanced stability of dna aptamers @xcite .",
    "for example , nguyen et al .",
    "@xcite measured the changes in rupture force of a dna aptamer ( that forms binding - pocket ) with amp ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) and without amp ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , and thereby determined the dissociation constant at single - molecule level .",
    "papamichael et al .",
    "@xcite used an aptamer - coated probe and an ige - coated mica surface to identify specific binding areas .",
    "efforts have also been made to determine the rupture force of aptamer binding to proteins and cells , and it was revealed that the binding - pocket enhances the rupture force by many folds @xcite .    despite the progress made , there are noticeable lack of investigations .",
    "for example , the melting of dna aptamer in presence and absence of amp and its dependence on the position in a dna strand need to be measured and understood correctly .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop a theoretical model to understand the role of a base - pocket and a binding - pocket on the rupture of a dna aptamer . for this , a coarse grained model of dna",
    "is developed . here , dsdna is made up of two segments .",
    "one of the segments consists of a dna loop or the base - pocket of eight g type nucleotides .",
    "the other segment is stem , which is made up of twelve g - c base - pairs .",
    "we vary the position of the binding - pocket ( fig .",
    "1 ( a ) ) and the base - pocket ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) along the chain , and measure the rupture force and melting temperature for both cases ( with and without amp ) .",
    "for the first time , we report the profile as a function of base / binding - pocket position . we find that even though the melting profile has one minima ( u - shape ) , there are two minima ( w - shape ) for rupture .",
    "this reflects that there are two symmetric positions , where the system can be more unstable .",
    "extensive atomistic simulations have been performed to validate these findings , which helped us to delineate the correct understanding of the role of base - pockets in the stability of dna aptamer . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly describe the model and the langevin dynamics simulation to study the rupture of dna aptamer @xcite .",

    "iii , we briefly explain the atomistic simulation @xcite and discuss the model independency of the results . finally in sec .",
    "iv , we conclude with a discussion on some future perspectives .",
    "we first adopt a minimal model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for a homo - sequence of dsdna consisting of @xmath3 base - pairs , where covalent bonds and base - pairing interactions are modelled by harmonic springs and lennard - jones ( lj ) potentials , respectively . by using langevin dynamics simulation ,",

    ", @xmath5 represents the position of bead @xmath6 on strand @xmath7 . in the present case , @xmath8 corresponds to first ( complementary ) strand of dsdna .",
    "the distance between intra - strand beads , @xmath9 , is defined as @xmath10 . the harmonic ( first ) term with spring constant @xmath11 couples the adjacent beads along each strand .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 corresponds to the equilibrium distance in the harmonic potential , which is close to the equilibrium position of the lj potential .",
    "the second term takes care of excluded volume effects _",
    "i.e. _ , two beads can not occupy the same space @xcite .",
    "the third term , described by the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential , takes care of the mutual interaction between the two strands .",
    "the first term of lj potential ( same as second term of eq.1 ) will not allow the overlap of two strands .",
    "the second term of the lj potential corresponds to the base - pairing between two strands .",
    "the base - pairing interaction is restricted to the native contacts ( @xmath13 ) only _ i.e. _ , the @xmath14 base of the @xmath15 strand forms pair with the @xmath14 base of the @xmath16 strand only .",
    "it is to be noted here that @xmath17 represents the strength of the lj potential . in eq . 1",
    ", we use dimensionless distances and energy parameters and set @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which corresponds to a homosequence dsdna .",
    "the binding - pocket and base - pocket can be modelled by substituting @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) and @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , respectively , among the bases inside the circle .",
    "the equation of motion is obtained from the following langevin equation :        @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the mass of a bead and the friction coefficient , respectively . here , @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 and the random force @xmath32 is a white noise @xcite , i.e. , @xmath33 .",

    "first , we have calculated the rupture force of a dsdna of two different lengths @xcite .",
    "we have inserted a base - pocket in the interior of the chain ( circle in fig .",
    "1(b ) and calculated the required force for the rupture at temperature @xmath36 .",
    "in order to obtain the rupture force for the dna aptamer , we switched on the interaction among the base - pocket nucleotides with amp ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) : each of these extra interaction strength is double of the base - pairing interactions . following the experimental protocol @xcite , we performed constant velocity simulation @xcite by fixing one end of a dna strand marked by a blank circle in fig . 1",
    ". force @xmath37 is applied on the other end of the strand marked by filled circle in fig . 1 . here",
    ", @xmath38 is the displacement of the pulled monomer from its original position , @xmath39 is the velocity , @xmath40 is the time and @xmath41 is the spring constant @xcite .",
    "the rupture force is identified as the maximum force , at which two strands separate suddenly .",
    "a selection of rupture force distribution of 500 events have been shown in fig .",
    "for a given loading rate , the most probable rupture force @xmath42 is obtained by the gaussian fit of the distribution of rupture force @xcite . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we have shown the variation of @xmath42 ( with and without amp ) with the loading rate ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "it is apparent from the plots that the rupture force required for the dna aptamer is larger than the dna ( without amp ) with base - pocket , and the qualitative nature remains same as seen in the experiment @xcite .     with binding - pocket positions and ( b ) with base - pocket positions .",
    "( c ) variation of @xmath42 with binding - pocket positions and ( d ) with base - pocket positions.,width=297 ]    for the better understanding of the role of base - pocket and binding - pocket , we varied its position along the chain continuously from one end to the other , and calculated the melting temperature ( @xmath44 ) and rupture force ( @xmath42 ) for each position in the constant force ensemble ( cfe ) @xcite .",
    "the melting temperature is obtained here by monitoring the energy fluctuation ( @xmath45 ) or the specific heat ( @xmath46 ) with temperature , which are given by the following relations @xcite @xmath47 the peak in the specific heat curve gives the melting temperature .",
    "since this simulation is in the equilibrium , we have used 10 realizations with different seeds and reported the mean value of the rupture force . in fig.3 ( a)@xmath48(d ) , we have plotted the variation of @xmath44 ( at @xmath49 ) and @xmath42 ( @xmath50 ) much below @xmath44 as a function of pocket position ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that for thermal melting , the variation looks like @xmath52 shape \" for the dna aptamer ( with amp ) shown in fig.3(a ) , and for without amp , profile has ",
    "u- shape \" having one minima ( fig .",
    "the rupture force remains invariant with binding - pocket positions for amp ( fig.3(c ) ) , which is consistent with experiment @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the absence of amp , the profile has ",
    "w - shape \" , _",
    "i.e. _ , with two minima ( fig.3(d ) ) .",
    "although , one may intuitively expect the shape of profiles to be symmetric for the homosequence .",
    "but it is not apparent , why does the profile has one minimum for the thermal melting and two minima for the dna rupture in the absence of amp .",
    "we now confine ourselves to understand these issues . in case of dna aptamer melting",
    ", one would expect naively that the aptamer is more stable , when the binding - pocket is in the interior of the chain .",
    "thus , @xmath44 should be high ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) compare to the binding pocket at the end resulting in a @xmath52 shape \" profile . in absence of amp",
    ", the profile looks like  u - shape \" . for a short chain , dna melting",
    "is well described by the two state model @xcite with @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the enthalapy and entropy , respectively .",
    "the melting temperature @xmath56 corresponds to the state with @xmath57 indicating that the system goes from the bound - state to the open - state and change in the free energy of the system is zero .",
    "it is often practically easier to identify @xmath44 as the temperature where @xmath58 hydrogen bonds are broken .    for a homo - sequence chain ( without base - pocket )",
    ", it was shown that the chain opens from the end rather than the interior of the chain @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the major contribution to the entropy comes from the opening of base - pairs near the end of the chain , and decreases to zero , when one approaches to the interior of the chain .",
    "in this case , there are two contributions to the entropy : entropy associated with opening of the end base - pairs ( @xmath59 ) and the base - pocket entropy ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "when a base - pocket is inserted at the end of dna chain , there is an additional contribution to the entropy , which is greater than @xmath61 or ( @xmath62 ) , but less than the sum of two .",
    "thus , @xmath44 decreases to @xmath63 from @xmath64 @xcite . as the base - pocket moves along the chain , entropy of interior base - pairs increases .",
    "combined effect of both entropies reduces the melting temperature further .",
    "once the base - pocket is deep inside , the total entropy of the system becomes equal to the sum of end - entropy and base - pocket entropy . as a result",
    ", @xmath44 remains constant(@xmath65 ) ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) irrespective of the base - pocket position . as base - pocket approaches towards the other end , by symmetry we observe  u-\"shape profile .",
    "the conversion of reduced unit to real unit indicates that it is possible to observe it _ in vitro _",
    "@xcite .",
    "understanding the decrease in @xmath44 with base - pocket position does not explain , why the rupture profile of dna has two minima .",
    "it is clear from the fig .",
    "3 ( b ) & ( d ) that the base - pocket entropy alone is not responsible for this ( @xmath66 ) shape . based on the ladder model of dna ( homo - sequence ) ,",
    "de gennes proposed that the rupture force @xmath42 is equal to @xmath67 @xcite . here , @xmath68 is the force required to separate a single base - pair and @xmath69 is the de gennes length , which is defined as @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 are the spring constants characteristic of stretching of the backbone and hydrogen bonds @xcite , respectively .",
    "de gennes length is the length over which differential force is distributed . above this length , the differential force approaches to zero and",
    "there is no extension in hydrogen bonds due to the applied force @xcite .",
    "when the base - pocket is at the end , four bases of one strand is under the tension , whereas the complementary four bases are free , thereby increasing the entropy of the system .",
    "the four bases act like a tethered length and a force is required to keep it stretched so that rupture can take place .",
    "it is nearly equal to the ruptured force of a 12 base - pair dsdna with no defect . as the base - pocket moves towards the center ,",
    "the entropy of base - pocket decreases as the ends of the base - pocket is now not free .",
    "since , the de gennes length for the base - pocket is infinite ( @xmath73 ) , it implies that the differential force remains constant inside the base - pocket , thereby decreases the stability of dna , and as a result , rupture force decreases further .",
    "the force acting at ends penetrates only up to the de gennes length and within this , the rupture force keeps on decreasing as base - pocket moves and approaches to its minimum . above a certain length ,",
    "the rupture force starts increasing , which can be seen in fig.3 ( d ) and approaches to the maximum at the middle of the chain .",
    "by symmetry , we get profile of two minima of  w - shape \" .     with base - pocket positions for different lengths .",
    ", width=163 ]    it should be pointed here , that the de gennes length in the present model is about ten @xcite , but for a dna of length @xmath74 base - pairs ( 12 complementary and 4 non complementary ) , the minima is around @xmath75 .",
    "note that the penetration depth for the two ends ( say @xmath76 ) is different because of the asymmetry arising due to the presence of base - pocket , and hence the minima shifts .",
    "if we increase the length of dna , keeping the base - pocket size constant , one would then expect that the minima will shift towards 10 ( above the de gennes length , the end - effect vanishes ) .",
    "this indeed we see in fig .",
    "4 , where the variation of @xmath42 with base - pocket position for different chain lengths ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) has been plotted . in all cases ,",
    "profiles have two minima , whereas minima shifts towards 10 as @xmath3 increases .",
    "de gennes equation predicts that @xmath42 increases linearly with length for small values of @xmath3 , and saturates at the higher values of @xmath3 , which is consistent with recent experiment @xcite and simulations @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , right side of the profile also appears to follow the de gennes equation .",
    "this implies that , the base - pocket can reduce the effective length of the chain , so that the rupture force is less compare to the bulk value and approaches to a minimum value at a certain position . as the end - effect decreases",
    ", @xmath42 starts increasing and approaches to its bulk value .",
    "in order to rule out the possibility that the above effect may be a consequence of the adopted model , we performed the atomistic simulations with explicit solvent . here , we have taken homo - sequence dna consisting of 12 g - c bps and a varying base - pocket of @xmath79 g - nucleotides @xcite .",
    "the starting structure of the dna duplex sequence having the base - pocket is built using make - na server@xcite .",

    "we have chosen the box dimension in such a way that the ruptured dna aptamer structure remains fully inside the water box .",
    "we have taken the box size of @xmath81 @xmath82 which contains @xmath83 water molecules and @xmath84 @xmath80 ( counterions ) .",
    "a force routine has been added in amber10 to do simulation at constant force @xcite . in this case , the force has been applied at @xmath76 ends .",
    "the electrostatic interactions have been calculated with particle mesh ewald ( pme ) method @xcite using a cubic b - spline interpolation of order 4 and a @xmath85 tolerance is set for the direct space sum cut off .",
    "a real space cut off of 10 @xmath86 is used for both the van der waal and the electrostatic interactions .",
    "the system is equilibrated at @xmath87 for 100 ps under a protocol described in ref . @xcite and it has been ensured that amp has bound with the base - pocket .",
    "we carried out simulations in the isothermal - isobaric ( npt ) ensemble using a time step of 1 fs for 10 different realizations .",
    "we maintain the constant pressure by isotropic position scaling @xcite with a reference pressure of 1 atm and a relaxation time of 2 ps .",
    "the constant temperature was maintained at 300 k using langevin thermostat with a collision frequency of 1 ps@xmath88 .",

    "5(b ) ) and calculated the rupture force with 10 realization of different seeds as a mean force .",
    "the required rupture forces for these positions are 840 pn @xmath90 20 pn , 720 pn @xmath90 20 pn and 830 pn @xmath90 20 pn , indicating that the complete profile contains two minima @xcite . in presence of amp , which interacts with the base - pocket ,",
    "we find @xmath91925pn @xmath90 20pn remains constant irrespective of binding - pocket position as seen earlier ( fig .",
    "this validates the finding of simple coarse grained model , which captured some essential but unexplored aspects of rupture mechanism of dna aptamer .",
    "our numerical studies clearly demonstrate that the force induced rupture and thermal melting of dna aptamer will vary quite significantly . in melting , all the nucleotides get almost equal thermal knock from the solvent molecules , whereas in dna rupture , force is applied at the ends and the differential force acts only up to the de gennes length @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the stability of dna in presence of base - pocket is strikingly different ( single minima _ vs _",
    "double minima ) .",
    "this may have biological / pharmaceutical significance because after the release of drug molecule , the stability of carrier dna depends on the position from which it is released .",
    "hence , at this stage our studies warrant further investigations most likely by new experiments to explore the role of base - pockets and its position , which will significantly enhance our understanding about the stability of dna aptamer and its suitability in the development and designing of drugs .",

    "<S> base - pockets ( non - complementary base - pairs ) in a double - stranded dna play a crucial role in biological processes . because of thermal fluctuations , it can lower the stability of dna , whereas , in case of dna aptamer , small molecules e.g. adenosinemonophosphate(amp ) , adenosinetriphosphate(atp ) etc , form additional hydrogen bonds with base - pockets termed as  binding - pockets \" , which enhance the stability . using the langevin dynamics simulations of coarse grained model of dna followed by atomistic simulations , we investigated the influence of base - pocket and binding - pocket on the stability of dna aptamer . </S>",
    "<S> striking differences have been reported here for the separation induced by temperature and force , which require further investigation by single molecule experiments . </S>"
