    "radio free - free continuum and recombination line observations show a n - s elongated structure attributed to a large scale outflow .",
    "the first vlbi observations of the 12.2ghz methanol masers ( @xcite ) revealed several groups of spots corresponding to different features in the single dish spectra .",
    "the subject of our study is the maser in the main spectral feature between about @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the 12.2ghz data cube from published data by @xcite , made from 1998 vlba observations , is shown in figure [ fig : data_all ] .",
    "the interpretation of the linear structure in space and velocity as an edge - on disc ( @xcite ) is supported by the positional agreement of the maser line with the waist of the hour - glass shaped continuum radio emission ( @xcite ) and a band of free - free absorption .",
    "the same structure is evident in the 6.7ghz maser data , obtained in february 2001 with the european vlbi network ( evn ) , shown in the figure .",
    "taking into account the different angular resolution , the velocity - integrated emission of the two masers is similar out to @xmath820mas in r.a .",

    "the 12.2ghz line involves the @xmath10 transition , the 6.7ghz line the @xmath11 transition .",
    "since @xmath12- and @xmath13-methanol can be regarded as distinct molecules for all practical purposes , the two masers can be expected to probe different physical conditions even when they reside in the same region . yet in spite of these differences , the brightness peaks of the two lines are perfectly coincident in both velocity and spatial location .",
    "the agreement is within the 12.2ghz angular resolution of 23 mas and the spectral resolutions of 0.048 and 0.09per channel for the 12.2- and 6.7ghz data , respectively . convolving the 12.2ghz data to the 6.7ghz spatial resolution",
    "we find that the ratio of the two emissions is constant to within 10% over the entire feature .",
    "the remarkable coincidence in space and frequency of the two masers is in fact a natural consequence of amplification of a background source by an edge - on rotating disk . in that case",
    "the maser brightness at displacements @xmath14 and @xmath15 from the position and velocity of the line - of - sight ( los ) diameter is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the background continuum and @xmath18 the maser ( negative ) optical depth .",

    "then where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is distance along the path . the width  is taken as constant , although it could vary with @xmath35 because of temperature variation and maser saturation .",
    "saturation typically requires @xmath36 1015 across the disc radius , and the broadening of the absorption profile is then proportional to length in excess of this threshold ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the disc is located in front of the background source then the overall amplification with @xmath37  18 implies an optical depth of only 9 across the radius , too low for saturation .",
    "if the radio continuum is centered on the star then the optical depth across the radius is  18 and saturation can be expected to have an effect , but only at the very outer segments of the disc where a decrease in temperature could have an opposite , offsetting effect .",

    "this discussion shows that the contours of highest amplification , down to 70% of @xmath64 , contain dependence on @xmath42 , @xmath65 and @xmath60 but not on .",
    "this has two important consequences : ( 1 ) successful modeling of the strongest maser emission requires one less parameter .",

    "therefore the data shown in the lower left map of figure [ fig : fit ] cover only the two innermost contours in figure [ fig : bv_tot ] , and if our model is applicable it should require only the three parameters @xmath65 , @xmath60 and @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , the first two can be determined quite accurately even without detailed modeling since the bend in the @xmath37-contours occurs at @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",
    "we find directly that @xmath65 = 0.39 and  = 0.037/mas , implying @xmath75 and leaving @xmath42 as the only free parameter to match all other data points in the @xmath76-plane .",
    "sensible fits to the 12.2ghz data are obtained when @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the lower right panel of figure [ fig : fit ] shows the model map for @xmath79 , the top panels show how well the fitting of @xmath18 reproduces the brightness profile and the spectrum .",
    "the negative @xmath42 means that @xmath38 , i.e. , the maser absorption coefficient , increases with radius .",
    "the relation between @xmath38 and overall density involves the product of the methanol abundance , the fraction of methanol in the maser system and the fractional inversion .",
    "any of these factors might give more weight to the disk outer regions .",
    "considering the simple power law with sharp cutoffs we employ , a 70% increase in @xmath38 across the disk is compatible with a constant density profile .",

    "the analysis presented here shows that a keplerian disk explains successfully , down to minute details , the main methanol maser feature in .",
    "the angular velocity we find implies a disk outer radius of 1000au if the central mass is 30 , as determined by @xcite .",
    "the methanol maser emission covers a substantial area of the disk , with the radius varying by a factor of 3 .",
    "the @xmath18-contours display a bend in the position - velocity diagram . since @xmath82 , a straight line in this diagram implies a constant @xmath83 , i.e. , either a single radius or , in the case of an extended region , solid - body rotation .",
    "our analysis therefore uncovers a unique signature of differential rotation in the disc .",
    "the emission s smooth structure and the observation s high sensitivity are crucial for this detection , which is made well inside the  1.2  width of the spectral feature ( see top right panels in figures [ fig : fit ] and [ fig : fit_6.7 ] ) .",
    "these requirements preclude detection of the effect in extragalactic sources and explain why it could not be considered in the analysis of the h@xmath84o maser disc in ngc4258 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , a bend in the position - velocity diagram has been found in thermal line emission from low - mass stars and interpreted as steep - gradient solid - body rotation inside a shallow - gradient keplerian outer region ( @xcite ) . since maser and optically thin thermal emission , which is directly proportional to optical depth ,",
    "share the same kinematic structure , our analysis shows there is no need to invoke additional components on top of keplerian rotation .",
    "our analysis is valid for a radio continuum source placed either behind the maser disc or at its center .",
    "the latter possibility would fit well in the context of disc photoevaporation models ( @xcite ) . in that case",
    ", the radial extent of disc photoevaporation by the central star in ngc7538 covers the entire maser region and could activate both methanol formation and the observed outflow , responsible for the radio continuum .",
    "the maser location at the outflow waistline makes this scenario especially attractive .",
    "the methanol maser data determines detailed disc properties with high precision yet the central mass remains undetermined since it requires the outer radius . and  is still unobservable because the angular extent of the detected emission does not trace the full disk , instead it is controlled by velocity coherence and the dynamic range of the observations .",
    "the amplification opacity at the disk outer edge ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bv_tot ] ) is 50% of the central peak level .",
    "with @xmath37 = 16 ( 18 ) at the center , detection of the outer peak requires a dynamic range of 3000 ( 8100 ) if the radio source is located behind the maser disc , placing it beyond the reach of the current observations by a factor of  30 ( 80 ) .",
    "the requirements become even more severe if the continuum is centered on the star .",
    "the 6.7ghz outlier features therefore can not correspond to the outer peak of our model disc .",
    "instead , these outliers are probably the first detection of enhanced amplification by small inhomogeneities in an otherwise rather smooth disc .",
    "such non - axisymmetric distortions of the disk surface , and their possible effect on the pumping , have been proposed by @xcite .",
    "it should be possible , though , to determine  by probing the boundary of the ( @xmath85 ) region at @xmath86 along the @xmath15-axis or another direction such as the normal to .",
    "we will study these issues in detail in a future publication .",
    "this study provides one of the few pieces of evidence to date for a compact ( @xmath3 au ) disc around a massive protostar .",
    "it seems certain , though , that not all class ii methanol masers occur in discs . even in itself ,",
    "the weaker methanol masers to the south , which are associated with other maser species ( oh , h@xmath87o etc ) , are likely to arise from an outflow .",
    "the interpretation of ordered lines of methanol masers in terms of disc or outflow models must be decided case by case with detailed modeling .",
