    "the reconstruction algorithm is based on the assumption that the light radiated by the muons is emitted under the cherenkov angle with respect to the muon path .",
    "we do nt take into account light scattering because the characteristic distances for atmospheric neutrino induced muons detection do not exceed 1@xmath12 scattering lengths of light in baikal water ( mean scattering angle cosine @xmath20.88)@xcite .",
    "the algorithm uses a single muon model to reconstruct events .",
    "we apply procedure rejecting hits , which are very likely due to dark current or water luminosity as well as hits which are due to showers and have large time delays with respect to expected hit times from the single muon cherenkov light .",
    "determination of the muon trajectory is based on the minimization of a @xmath3 function with respect to measured and calculated times of hit channels . as a result of the @xmath3 minimization we obtain the track parameters ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 and spatial coordinates ) .",

    "the core of eas triggered the scintillater array is expected to lead to an acoustic signal in the ice and in the upper water layer . with 5 pev energy threshold of the eas - array , 2 - 3 events per hour have been observed .",
    "acoustic hydrophone was placed 90 m apart from the center of the eas array at a depth 5 m .",
    "characteristic bipolar acoustic signals with about 150 @xmath57s duration and with a reasonable delay time compared to the eas trigger have been detected .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the data shows that the amplitudes of the acoustic signals are somewhat larger than it would be expected from standard thermoacoustic theory @xcite .",

    "35 neutrino induced upward muons have been reconstructed .",
    "although in a good agreement with mc expectation this number is on factor 3 lower then predicted for the fully operational _",
    "nt-200_. the reason is that , due to unstable operation of electronics , in average only 50 - 70 channels have taken data during 1998 .",
    "this is in contrast to 1999 and 2000 data taking where stability had improved .",
    "ten events within a 30 degree half angle cone around nadir have been selected and limits on the excess of muon flux due to wimp annihilation in the center of the earth have been derived .",

    "it will investigate atmospheric neutrino spectra above 10 gev ( about 1 atmospheric neutrino per two - three days ) .",

    "nt-200 _ for high energy electron and tau neutrinos detection is more than two orders of magnitude larger than its geometrical volume .",
    "this will permit a search for diffuse neutrino fluxes from agn and other extraterrestrial sources on a level of theoretical predictions .    with an effective area two times larger than super - kamiokande , for nearly vertically upward muons ( e@xmath5810 gev ) _",
    "nt-200 _ will be one of the most powerful arrays for indirect search for wimp annihilation in the center of the earth during the next few years .",
