    "nucleosynthesis from core - collapse supernovae is certainly responsible for the production of intermediate mass elements including the so - called alpha elements and a certain fraction of iron isotopes and their neighbors ( the fe - group nuclei ) .",

    "a major open question is related to the source of heavy elements beyond iron .",
    "there have been strong expectations that the innermost layer of ejecta , close to the forming neutron star , remains neutron - rich and is a possible site for the @xmath0-process . for many years",
    "the late neutrino - driven wind ( ndw ) , following the actual explosion , seemed an adequate @xmath0-process site in core - collapse supernovae that formed a neutron star @xcite .",
    "such investigations were followed up by many parametrized calculations that explored the sensitivity of the most relevant @xmath0-process parameter , the neutron - to - seed ratio , via variations of entropy @xmath3 , electron fraction ( or number of proton per nucleon ) @xmath4 and expansion timescale @xmath5 @xcite . however , steady state wind models @xcite showed that it is very hard to attain the required entropies .",
    "these results have been recently confirmed by fully hydrodynamical simulations @xcite that in addition showed that the presence of a reverse shock does not have any major impact on the neutron - to - seed ratio .",
    "furthermore , recent investigations noticed that the early ndw turns matter proton - rich , producing specific fe - group isotopes and in the subsequent @xmath6-process nuclei with a mass number up to @xmath7  @xmath8 @xcite . while it was initially hoped that there exists a chance that the late ndw still turns neutron - rich ( after its initial , early proton - rich phase ) existing core - collapse calculations seem to indicate that the wind becomes even more proton - rich in the long - term evolution @xcite ,",
    "although very recent investigations @xcite related to the spectral evolution of @xmath9 and @xmath10 in medium might change this somewhat .",
    "it was realized that the best chance to eject neutron - rich matter , is to utilize material stemming from the initial collapse and compression , where electron captures turned it neutron - rich early in the explosion , before neutrino interactions have the chance to convert it into proton - rich matter in the ndw .",
    "electron - capture supernovae , which explode without a long phase of accretion onto the proto - neutron star , apparently provide such conditions @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath11 s obtained under such conditions do not support a strong @xmath0-process , which successfully reproduces the platinum peak of @xmath0-elements around @xmath12 .",
    "an alternative explosive scenario as a possible site for the @xmath0-process has been suggested by @xcite , where after a supernova explosion a quark  hadron phase transition inside the neutron star can eject very neutron - rich material from the neutron star surface .",
    "this scenario has been referred to as a _ quark - nova_. in the present paper , we follow a different approach and investigate core - collapse supernova explosions that are triggered by a quark - hadron phase transition during the early post - bounce phase ( for details , see * ? ? ?",

    "the explosion models have been discussed in detail by @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we summarize the main features of the explosion models and the input physics of the nuclear reaction network utilized for nucleosynthesis .",
    "a self - consistent supernova explosion model , which we adopt to investigate nucleosynthesis in the present work , has been carried out by using the agile - boltztran code .",

    "the baryonic eos in supernovae needs in general to be known for the following three intrinsically different regimes :    1 .   at temperatures below @xmath13 gk ( @xmath14 mev ) ,",
    "the baryon eos is dominated by heavy nuclei and their abundances , determined by individual nuclear reactions which are not necessarily in equilibrium . in @xcite",
    ", we included a nuclear reaction network , consisting of 20 nuclei , which permits to simulate a large domain of the progenitor up to the helium  layer and is utilized to predict the amount of energy generation by explosive nuclear burning .",

    "note , the different post - bounce times for the onset of deconfinement , and hence for the onset of the explosion , lead to different proto - neutron star structures .",
    "in general , a delayed phase transition at higher densities translates to a longer mass accretion phase ( for the same progenitor ) .",

    "an earlier phase transition and less steep density gradient would result in a slower expansion and a slightly higher @xmath4 .",

    "whether such quark  hadron hybrid eos will result in a similar dynamical evolution as discussed in @xcite will be examined in future simulations .",
    "the supernova post - bounce evolution is characterized by mass accretion causing a continuous rise of the central density .",

    "hadron phase transition takes place , leading to the appearance of a quark ",
    "hadron mixed phase .",
    "thereby , quark matter appears in the supernova core where the highest densities are experienced .",
    "the timescale for the appearance of quark matter is given by the timescale for the central density to rise .",
    "this depends on the progenitor model , which determines mass accretion rates , and the hadronic eos .",
    "note that the eos in the mixed phase is significantly softer than in hadronic and pure quark phases .",
    "it is a consequence of the assumed first - order phase transition .",
    "mass accretion from the outer layers of the progenitor onto the central supernova core leads to a continuous rise of the central enclosed mass .",
    "when the critical mass ( given by the hybrid eos ) of the configuration is obtained , it becomes gravitationally unstable and the supernova core begins to contract .",
    "the contraction proceeds into a collapse which rises the density and converts the hadronic core into quark matter at around the center .",
    "a massive pure quark core forms at the center , where the eos stiffens and the collapse halts , and an accretion shock forms .",
    "the shock wave propagates out of the high - density supernova core , remaining an accretion front with no matter outflow .",
    "once it reaches the outer layers of the central core , where the density drops over several orders of magnitude , the accretion front accelerates and turns into a dynamic shock with matter outflow .",
    "this moment determines the onset of an explosion , also for supernova models which would otherwise not explode in spherical symmetry , based on explosion mechanisms discussed so far . finally , at distances on the order of @xmath23 km the expanding shock wave merges with the standing shock from the initial core bounce at nuclear densities , which was unaffected by the dynamics occurring in the supernova core .",

    "this second neutrino burst is of particular interest for water - cherenkov neutrino detectors , which are more sensitive to @xmath10 than to @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the currently operating generation of water - cherenkov neutrino detectors ( e.g. , super - kamiokande and icecube detectors ) can resolve such millisecond neutrino burst of the explosion models by @xcite .",
    "the matter considered for nucleosynthesis studies of heavy elements ( see section 3 ) belongs originally to the inner parts of the silicon and sulfur layers of the @xmath15 @xmath16 progenitor from @xcite , with temperature and electron fraction of @xmath27 gk and @xmath28 , respectively , at @xmath29  @xmath30",

    "the plot shows only the mass zone range 001 to 090 for enclosed mass and @xmath4 . for the mass zones 90 to 120 , @xmath4 stays essentially constant at @xmath14 and the enclosed mass continues to be proportional to mass zone numbers . ]",
    "we also employ neutrino interactions with matter in order to include dominant weak interactions affecting the evolution of the overall proton / nucleon ratio @xmath11 . for ( anti-)electron neutrino captures by nucleons , we adopt reaction rates derived by @xcite but ignore any reactions with heavy isotopes because the amount of neutrino capture is negligible for the early phase of nucleosynthesis .",
    "the neutrino fluxes , resulting from the detailed neutrino - radiation hydrodynamics calculation described in the previous subsection , are utilized to determine the actual rates as a function of time .",
    "these reaction rates depend on the distance from the proto - neutron star and the mean energy and luminosity of neutrinos emitted from the proto - neutron star .",
    "it depends on the structure and the evolution , which is sensitive to the eos , and the precise evolution history of ejected matter including the early phase of the core bounce .",
    "thus , this is different from the treatment of other nuclear reaction rates , which are determined only by local thermodynamic conditions and density and temperature .",
    "in order to calculate the nucleosynthesis evolution of ejected matter within a postprocessing approach , the dynamic evolution is required in radial lagrangian mass zones . for this reason ,",
    "the evolution determined with the radiation hydrodynamics code agile - boltztran ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) which is based on an adaptive grid , was mapped on a lagrangian grid of 120 mass zones .",
    "this provides the lagrangian evolution of physical quantities , such as density , temperature , electron fraction , and velocity of the ejected material , and in addition the neutrino fluxes experienced as a function of time .",

    "they are also shown with respect to their mass as well as @xmath4-distribution in figure [ fig - init ] .     as a function of time after the core bounce .",
    "the deconfinement phase transition happens about 0.4 s after this initial bounce , causing the explosion and ejection of matter .",

    "these zones coincide with the matter discussed at the end of section 2.2 , where at high densities a @xmath4 decrease down to even @xmath39 has been noticed .",
    "the evolution of these mass zones in time is displayed in figure [ fig - properties ] .",
    "zones 001 to 014 are not ejected within @xmath40 s after the core bounce .",
    "these zones preserve the original low-@xmath4 obtained during collapse and shock wave propagation . as they are not ejected , we ignore them in the further nucleosynthesis discussion , plus all matter originating from regions at smaller radii . in figure [ fig - properties ] , they are displayed in black .",
    "zones 015 to 019 are ejected in the so - called ndw , shown in red .",
    "their @xmath4 is strongly affected by neutrino interactions , turning this matter proton - rich .",
    "zones 020 to 050 ( displayed in green ) have stalled from infall after shock formation and are ejected thereafter due to neutrino heating and dynamic effects @xcite .",
    "the adjacent zones 051 to 120 are ejected in a prompt way , due to the shock wave originating from the deconfinement phase transition ( displayed in blue ) .",
    "we clearly see the division of matter which is ejected in a prompt fashion ( blue ) , matter which is coasting and falling in again , but gets reaccelerated outward by neutrino energy deposition ( green ) , matter which falls back onto the neutron star , but becomes part of the ndw ejecta ( red ) , and finally matter which stays on the neutron star and will never be ejected ( black ) .",

    "proton mass difference .",
    "]    as shown in the bottom part of figure [ fig - properties ] , the blue and green zones are neutronized during the collapse via electron capture to various degrees , depending on the maximum density attained .",
    "thus the main feature is that a strong compression during infall leads to high densities ( at still low entropies , i.e. highly degenerate matter ) with large electron fermi energies which endorse electron captures and a strong neutronization of matter with a small @xmath4 .",
    "their @xmath4-values range from @xmath43 to @xmath40 .",
    "the prompt or quasi - prompt ejection does not change this value ( with minor effects on the innermost zones , being partially affected by the ndw ) .",
    "the effect of neutrino and anti - neutrino exposure from the core leads also to an increase of @xmath4 , as discussed before .",
    "therefore , the major point in favor of an @xmath0-process is a fast expansion of that material having two aspects : ( 1 ) timescales are shorter than needed for attaining weak equilibrium and ( 2 ) matter moves fast to larger radii where the effect of neutrinos vanishes ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the mass zones in red experience a similar effect in their early evolution during collapse , but the later evolution leads to values of @xmath4 exceeding @xmath40 .",
    "this is similar to recent studies of the ndw ( see the introduction and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where similar neutrino and anti - neutrino spectra and flux intensities favor proton - rich matter due to the neutron ",
    "proton mass difference , resulting in different energies available for the neutrino / anti - neutrino captures . as",
    "the neutrino luminosity is still high in the ejection phase , we expect @xmath6-process nucleosynthesis . finally non - ejected mass zones ( black ) can initially also experience interaction with the neutrino flux and turn proton - rich while still at larger radii and small(er ) densities .",
    "once they settle on the surface of the neutron star at high densities , capture of degenerate electrons dominates over the neutrino effects , and they turn neutron - rich again .     and",
    "entropy @xmath3 , which set the conditions for explosive nucleosynthesis at the time of matter ejection .",
    "the innermost ejected zones are proton - rich due the effect of the neutrino - driven wind , which also heats matter efficiently , leading to high entropies .",
    "the outer mass zones , ejected in a more prompt fashion keep their original ( slightly neutron - rich ) @xmath4 from the infall / compression phase . ]    the thermodynamic conditions ( density , temperature , and entropy ) , which are responsible for the nucleosynthesis results , are shown in figure [ fig - postprocess ] for the ejected mass zones .",
    "these figures indicate a temperature , density , and entropy maximum when the quark ",
    "hadron phase transition occurs , which causes a second core bounce ( about @xmath45 s after the first bounce at nuclear densities ; see figure [ fig - properties ] ) and an outgoing shock front forms .",
    "the expansion follows a close to constant entropy , i.e. is adiabatic , once matter is ejected ( after @xmath45 s for the prompt ejection and after @xmath46 s for the delayed ejection ) .",
    "the matter which initially fell back onto the proto - neutron star and is finally ejected by the ndw , experiences heating and an entropy rise due to this energy deposition by neutrinos .",
    "the properties of the neutrino and anti - neutrino flux ( luminosities , average energies and neutrino sphere radii ) can be found in figure    [ fig - neutrinos ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that the initial bounce ( @xmath47 s ) at nuclear densities leads to a neutrino burst due to electron captures , while the second shock wave caused by the quark - hadron phase transition ( at @xmath45 s ) also produces antineutrinos .",
    "from that point on in time the neutrino and anti - neutrino luminosities are comparable ( slightly smaller for anti - neutrinos ) .",
    "the average energies are larger for anti - neutrinos than for neutrinos , but the difference remains less than 4 mev .",
    "neutrino and anti - neutrino captures determine the neutron / proton ratio due to the reactions @xmath48    he ( @xmath49-particles ) after charged - particle freeze - out .",
    "both properties result from the original @xmath4 and entropy @xmath3 in these mass zones . in turn",
    "they determine the fraction of heavy elements and whether those experience further neutron capture after charged - particle freeze - out , which is the key to the pattern of heavy nuclei and the maximum mass number attained . in the inner part ( green lines )",
    "an effect is seen , which results from an intermediate fallback before final ejection .",
    "these mass zones experience first ( due to the shock from the deconfinement phase transition ) a maximum temperature and density , expand afterwards close to adiabatically , heat up during the intermediate fallback , and then expand freely .",
    "the line indicated with  no - boost  gives the initial neutron / seed ratio after the first expansion .",
    "the alpha - fraction in the inner zones results from the reheating phase .",
    "the initial expansion at low @xmath4 s would result in vanishing alpha - fractions . ]",
    "based on the neutron / proton mass difference of @xmath50  mev , @xcite could show ( see their equation ( 4 ) ) , that with the use of equations ( 64a ) and ( 64b ) in @xcite , @xmath51 in the case that the difference between the mean antineutrino and neutrino energies fulfills @xmath52 , with @xmath53 and where @xmath54 is the mean energy and @xmath55 is the square value of the root - mean - square ( rms ) energy .",
    "therefore @xmath56 is obtained if the timescale for neutrino / anti - neutrino captures is shorter than the dynamic timescale .",
    "thus , for all conditions discussed here , where neutrino and anti - neutrino captures are responsible for the @xmath57/@xmath58 ratio , proton - rich conditions are attained , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "that is exactly what is seen in figures [ fig - properties ] and [ fig - neutrinos ] for mass zones which experience essential neutrino fluxes ( weighted by @xmath44 ) at radii of about 100 km .",
    "it is related to the spectral evolution of @xmath9 and @xmath10 after the onset of explosion and has been discussed in detail in @xcite . for matter at larger radii ( about 1000 km ) , the timescale for this process is too long and minor @xmath4 changes occur , i.e. , the initial @xmath4 from the collapse phase is retained .",
    "matter at smaller radii , on top of the neutron star , experiences high densities and electron fermi energies , where electron captures dominate which make matter neutron - rich .",
    "figure [ fig - entye ] underlines this effect due to neutrino interactions or electron capture .",
    "all outer mass zones keep their original @xmath4 , which is due to electron capture at high densities during the collapse , and ranges from about @xmath59 ( further out ) to @xmath60 ( for the inner quasi - prompt ejected matter ) .",
    "material which fell in initially onto the surface of the neutron star and is then ejected via the ndw , has been turned proton - rich by neutrino and anti - neutrino captures with values up to @xmath61 .",
    "the ndw also leads to energy deposition and an entropy increase to maximum values of about @xmath62 @xmath63 per baryon .",
    "the entropy in the outer ejected regions is of the order @xmath64@xmath65 @xmath63 per baryon , caused by shock heating during the passage of the ejection shock wave .      in the following",
    "we show final nucleosynthesis results for a number of typical mass zones . in order to get a rough idea about the results of explosive nucleosynthesis",
    ", one can utilize either maximum densities and temperatures prior to an adiabatic expansion or the entropies attained in the expanding matter ( in radiation - dominated regimes @xmath66 ) .",
    "comparing entries in figure 5 of @xcite and fig.3 of @xcite leads to the conclusion that ( 1 ) these are typical conditions for an alpha - rich freeze - out from explosive si - burning and ( 2 ) one would expect remaining alpha mass - fractions after charged - particle freeze  out of the order 20%  100% .",
    "one should consider , however , that those calculations were performed for hydrodynamic ( i.e. , free fall ) expansion timescales , which can differ from the actual simulation , and a value of @xmath67 , i.e. matter neither neutron nor proton - rich .",
    "therefore we expect the following changes : ( 1 ) higher / lower entropies within the given variety will lead to higher / lower remaining alpha - fractions ; ( 2 ) higher @xmath68 , i.e. , more proton - rich matter causes an alpha - rich charged - particle freeze - out with remaining free protons , which can thereafter lead to a @xmath6-process , if a sufficient flux of electron anti - neutrinos is still present ; ( 3 ) smaller @xmath4 s , i.e. , more neutron - rich matter permits to bypass the slower triple - alpha reaction via the faster @xmath69-reaction , in order to produce heavier nuclei and a reduction in the remaining alpha - fraction is expected . in addition , free neutrons are remaining after the charged - particle freeze - out .",
    "with respect to this latter aspect , we expect also the additional behavior : higher entropies and lower @xmath4 s lead to a larger neutron / seed ratio , seed nuclei being the heaviest nuclei formed after charged - particle freeze - out , and permit therefore more neutron captures on these seed - nuclei .",
    "dependent on the neutron to seed ratio , this could lead to light , medium or strong @xmath0-processing , producing nuclei in the first , second or third @xmath0-process peaks , around a=80 , 130 or 195 , depending on the actual n / seed ratio attained .",

    "mass zones 60 and 70 , which experience the highest entropies and moderately decreased @xmath4 s , can move matter up to and ( slightly ) beyond @xmath76 ( for mass zone 70 still with a large fraction of matter in the fe - group ) , mostly due to a more neutron - rich ( lower @xmath4 ) charged - particle freeze - out and not due to further neutron processing ( see neutron / seed ratio in figure  [ fig - xalnseed ] ) .",
    "one can also see a variation in the final carbon - fraction , underlining how effective the bridging of the alpha - to - carbon bottle neck of reactions is in comparison to subsequent capture reactions to heavier nuclei . at smaller radii ( mass zones 020 to 051 and @xmath4 s as small as 0.33 ) ,",

    "this can be seen in the first three panels of figure  [ fig - finab ] , dashed lines show abundances without the inclusion of the @xmath6-process , solid lines show the final results after @xmath6-processing . while in terms of total mass fraction",

    "the discussion of nucleosynthesis in layers further out is only affected by the energy in the shock wave , as has been discussed extensively in the literature @xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "finally , we also discuss the overall features of the integrated yields ( of these inner mass zones , close to the explosion mechanism ) .",

    "moving somewhat further in with slightly increasing entropies , noticeable amounts of @xmath71ge are produced as well , with the @xmath71ge/@xmath90ni being a measure of entropy .",
    "decreasing @xmath4 , i.e. , having more neutron - rich conditions , changes the initially pure alpha - rich charged - particle freezeout to an alpha - rich freeze - out with sizable abundances up to @xmath76 .",
    "a further decrease in @xmath4 causes remaining free neutrons , which permit an additional sequence of neutron captures .",
    "the decrease of @xmath4 down to @xmath91 , leads to a charged - particle freeze - out with vanishing alpha - fractions but a sufficient amount of free neutrons , which permit later to produce nucleosynthesis ejecta in the mass a=130 peak .",
    "the mass zones which are affected by a reheating boost are characterized by photo - disintegrations and a second charged - particle freeze - out with remaining alpha - fractions , finally the innermost proton - rich zones , with higher entropies of about @xmath92 per baryon and experiencing a continuous neutrino - flux , show an alpha - rich and proton - rich freeze - out with @xmath4 s up to @xmath93 .",
    "this causes a @xmath6-process after charged - particle freeze - out , permitted by neutron production via anti - neutrino captures on free protons .",
    "this process will produce nuclei up to @xmath76 , but on the proton - rich side of stability , especially sr , y , and zr isotopes .",
    "after this survey of the conditions at charged - particle freeze - out , combined with the final ejecta composition as a function of radial mass coordinate as discussed in the previous section , we want to give an integrated presentation for these inner mass zones which experience conditions for the possible formation of nuclei beyond the fe - group .",
    "figure  [ fig - integ ] ( top ) shows the composition for this range in mass numbers in comparison to solar @xmath0-abundances .",
    "as we do not yet know the frequency of such events , i.e. which range of the initial mass function of stellar masses leads to these types of explosions , we show a scaling normalized to the @xmath94 mass region ( where the dominant abundances are obtained ) . the bottom part of figure  [ fig - integ ] shows the individual contributions to the overall abundances by the different mass zones as presented in table [ tab - properties ] and figure  [ fig - init ] , and shown in different colors in figure  [ fig - properties ] and [ fig - postprocess ] as well as [ fig - entye ] , [ fig - xalnseed ] , and [ fig - finab ] .",
    "the high end of the abundance distribution in the prompt ( blue , dashed ) as well as the delayed ( boosted ) ejecta ( green , solid ) are due to the most neutron - rich conditions with @xmath4 close to @xmath91 .",
    "the outermost ejected mass zones with @xmath4 closer to @xmath40 contribute to the fe - group and matter up to @xmath95 ( lower range of mass numbers of blue dashed line ) .",
    "the ndw ( red line ) with slightly proton - rich ejecta ( @xmath96 ) produces significant abundances only up to @xmath72 , if the same normalization for the relevant mass zones is used ( see , however , also figure  [ fig - nup ] ) .",
    "it is clearly visible that , first of all , objects like these supernovae , exploding by a mechanism based on eoss with a low - density quark ",
    "hadron phase transition , do only experience a weak @xmath0-process in ejected mass zones which were neutronized during collapse .",
    "there is no matter produced in the third @xmath0-process peak . if normalizing the abundance curve at @xmath97 , in order to avoid an overproduction of this mass region , also only a small contribution ( less than 10% is expected to the second @xmath0-process peak , i.e. , @xmath98 ) .",
    "the major production affects the atomic mass range from @xmath99 to @xmath100 , curiously also reproducing a minimum at @xmath101@xmath102 .",
    "thus , the type of events discussed here , contribute to the whole mass region beyond the fe - group up to @xmath103 in a significant way , accompanied by minor contributions to the second @xmath0-process peak at @xmath82 .",
    "the major uncertainty in the present calculations is expected from the uncertain properties of the eos , especially the quark ",
    "hadron phase transition which is at the origin of the explosion mechanism discussed here .",
    "this was already reviewed extensively in section 2.1 .",
    "the analysis done by @xcite with variations in the properties of the phase transition , led to different post - bounce times for the onset of the explosion and different neutron star structures .",
    "later transitions at higher densities cause more massive progenitors with steeper density gradients at the surface . the standard case of the present paper corresponds to eos2 in figure  17 of @xcite , i.e. , a late(r ) explosion with steep(er ) density gradient and thus a fast expansion .",
    "variations toward the properties of eos1 , with an earlier explosion , would cause slower expansions .",
    "therefore , we performed test ( nucleosynthesis ) calculations with slower expansions for a specific mass zone ( here zone 51 , see also figures  [ fig - finab ] ) which provided among the best @xmath0-process conditions in our standard case .",
    "figs.[fig - dens ] and [ fig - temp ] show variations with exponential density expansions fitted to the standard case ( @xmath104 ) and slower expansions with longer expansion times scales by a factor of two , five , and 10 ( choosing the temperature according to adiabatic expansions with the same entropy ) .    )",
    "lead to smaller remaining alpha fractions ( as expected ) , but also to a slightly stronger ( weak ) @xmath0-process , indicated by the abundances in the @xmath98 peak . ]    in typical ndw environments for given @xmath3 and @xmath4 , a fast(er ) expansion leads to a strong(er ) alpha - rich freeze - out , thus more alpha particles and less seeds and a higher neutron / seed ratio , promoting the options for a stronger @xmath0-process .",
    "however , in the mass zones of interest here , the @xmath4 is quite low and the remaining alpha - fraction close to negligible .",
    "this feature was discussed extensively in section 3.3 with respect to figures  [ fig - xalnseed ] and [ fig - finab ] .",
    "we see the effect in figure  [ fig - fabund ] , that the fastest expansion ( @xmath104 ) shows the highest remaining alpha - fraction , but only of the order @xmath105 .",
    "this behavior lowers the initial seed abundance after charged - particle freeze - out by the same amount , which is negligible .",
    "this causes essentially the same seed abundances and neutron / seed ratio for all calculations with different expansion speeds ( @xmath104  @xmath106 ) and cancels this dominant effect in typical neutrino - driven wind environments .",
    "in fact , the slowest expansion leads to the highest abundances at @xmath98 . here , a second - order effect seems to take over , the different density and temperature conditions for slower expansions lead to an apparently slightly more neutron - rich @xmath0-process path , encountering smaller beta - decay half - lives which permit to proceed faster to heavier nuclei .",
    "this behavior , as shown in figure  [ fig - fabund ] , indicates a slightly stronger ( weak ) @xmath0-process for the slower expansions .",
    "however , the effect is not strong , only clearly visible for @xmath107 , which is larger than the uncertainty encountered in our eos variations .",
    "one can argue , that there might exist some uncertainty in weak interactions which determine @xmath4 , especially due to recent developments of including charged - current rates that are consistent with the eos ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these very recent preliminary investigations include medium effects for the ( electron ) neutrino and antineutrino capture reactions , which lead to changed reaction @xmath108-values by adding nucleon interaction potential differences for neutrons and protons , enhancing as a result the difference between average anti - neutrino and neutrino energies .",
    "this causes a change in @xmath4 .",
    "all our earlier discussions had the main emphasis that the influence of the neutrino flux from the proto - neutron star would cause an increase in @xmath4 .",
    "the preliminary analysis of such effects by @xcite and @xcite , which were not yet included in the present calculations , shows that the @xmath4 increase is weakened or even moderately neutron - rich conditions ( @xmath109 ) can result .",
    "for this reason , we also repeated the present nucleosynthesis calculations with variations in the initial @xmath4 for the mass zones experiencing prompt and delayed explosions , according to the following recipe : @xmath110 where the @xmath111 s are the corrected ones and @xmath112 denotes the percentage of uncertainty in deviations of @xmath4 from the symmetric value @xmath40 , which enlarges these deviation from @xmath40 .",
    "this lowers the initially only moderately neutron - rich @xmath4 s in regions which already produced @xmath98 nuclei .",
    "the nucleosynthesis results are presented in figures  [ fig - integ ] and [ fig - honda ] and show the options of obtaining a full or weak @xmath0-process .",
    "however , we expect that any uncertainties beyond @xmath113% are unrealistic for the explosion model we adopt in the current work .",
    "as is obvious from the discussion above , that only a  weak \" @xmath0-process can be supported by the nucleosynthesis conditions found in the explosion mechanism discussed and presented here , one might wonder whether such conditions support abundance features found in ",
    "weak @xmath0-process \" low - metallicity stars as observed by @xcite . for this reason , we also show such a comparison in figure  [ fig - honda ] .",
    "what can be seen is that these observations also show sizable @xmath0-process features above the @xmath98 peak , although weaker than in solar @xmath0-element abundances .",
    "if such abundance distributions are the result of a single nucleosynthesis pollution , also the  weak \" @xmath0-process found in the present paper can only marginally explain such features .",
    "one could argue , however , that such observed abundance features are a combination of at least two pollutions , one ( low level ) solar @xmath0-contribution plus another  weak \" @xmath0-contribution extending only up to @xmath98 .      nucleosynthesis uncertainties due to multi - dimensional effects , i.e. , convective turnover , have not been considered here , but we want to discuss their possible impact .",
    "note that convection and the presence of unstable fluid motion are typically associated with compositional mixing , also of the ejected material .",
    "their development , e.g. , after the shock passage across a low - density environment , can leave peculiar features such as discussed in @xcite at the example of a @xmath114 star explosion . in order to give an estimate for our nucleosynthesis results obtained in the presence of possible convection , we evaluated the ledoux criterion @xcite .",
    "it is related to entropy per baryon and lepton - number gradients .",
    "we find that regions where these gradients become largely negative , i.e. regions where convection may develop , correspond to either fall - back of material or the shock propagation in @xmath115 material .",
    "thus , matter with such uncertainties is either not ejected ( fallback ) or mixing occurs in regions with very similar @xmath4 .",
    "hence , we expect the impact of possible convection on the here discussed nucleosynthesis scenario to be of minor importance , in particular the ejected material which attains low-@xmath4 is not affected .",
    "independent of this expected unimportance of convection for nucleosynthesis results , we should keep in mind that matter is strongly accelerated and thus ejected very fast .",
    "even if instabilities exist , they should not lead to significant mixing on such small timescales after the onset of the explosion and affect the nucleosynthesis .     in comparison to abundance features in `` weak @xmath0-process '' low metallicity stars as observed by @xcite .",
    "we also indicate the effect of uncertainties in the @xmath4 determination , given in terms of percentage @xmath116    nevertheless , this nucleosynthesis site inhabits another possibility of convection due to the explosion mechanism related to the quark ",
    "hadron phase transition .",
    "it takes place on timescales on the order of several 100 ms , depending on details of the quark ",
    "hadron eos , in the absence of any other , e.g. , neutrino - driven explosion . on these timescales ,",
    "large - scale convection may develop before the transition / explosion is initiated .",
    "exploring its impact on the entire explosion and nucleosynthesis scenario will require multi - dimensional simulations , especially related to the point in time when this explosion starts ( possibly affected by convection and related neutrino losses and/or uncertainties in the eos , which both determine the @xmath4 at the onset of the explosion ) .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present article and will require future investigations .",
    "supernova nucleosynthesis is well understood for the outer ejected mass zones , which can be well approximated by a shock wave with appropriate energy passing through the layers of the progenitor @xcite .",
    "what remains uncertain is the composition of the innermost ejecta , directly linked to the explosion mechanism , i.e. , the collapse and explosion phase . in the present paper , we analyzed these mass zones of core - collapse supernova explosions triggered by a quark  hadron phase transition during the early post - bounce phase @xcite .",
    "a number of aspects are important for understanding these results .",
    "the very innermost ejecta are strongly affected by the ndw .",
    "recent investigations noticed that this ndw turns matter proton - rich , producing specific fe - group isotopes and in the subsequent @xmath6-process nuclei with masses up to @xmath117 @xcite . even in the long - term evolution",
    "proton - rich conditions prevail @xcite .",
    "thus , there seems to exist no chance to produce @xmath0-process matter in these innermost regions , despite many interesting parameter studies for ndw ejecta in terms of entropy @xmath3 , electron fraction @xmath4 , and expansion timescale @xmath5 @xcite or hydrodynamic studies , partially with parameter variations @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite and @xcite , explored charged - current weak processes ( i.e. , electron - neutrino and anti - neutrino captures on neutrons and protons ) , consistent with the eoss in neutrino - driven supernova explosion .",
    "they find modifications of the reaction @xmath108-values due to medium effects , which increase spectral differences between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this results in slightly neutron - rich ejecta .",
    "nevertheless , since the entropy per baryon is still low a strong @xmath0-process is unlikely to occur .    in order to obtain @xmath0-process conditions ,",
    "a better chance to eject neutron - rich matter is provided , when neutron - rich matter stems from the initial collapse and compression , where electron captures made it neutron - rich , early in an explosion , before neutrino interactions have the chance to turn it proton - rich in the ndw .",
    "core - collapse supernovae , exploding via the quark  hadron phase transition ( the focus of the present study ) , or electron - capture supernovae @xcite , which explode without a long phase of accretion onto the proto - neutron star , both lead to a rather prompt ejection of prior compressed and neutronized matter .",
    "however , the @xmath4 obtained under such conditions does not support a full @xmath0-process .",
    "this kind of outcome also characterizes the conditions we find in the prompt and quasi - prompt ejecta of the present study , which did not experience a strong neutrino flux .",
    "however , the @xmath4-values attained are not smaller than @xmath91 .",
    "whether uncertainties in the input or explosion physics can change this down to values close to @xmath118 , necessary for obtaining the third @xmath0-process peak , remains to be shown in an upcoming article where we will include charged - current reaction rates that are consistent with the eos following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a related , but different , phenomenon has been discussed in ( * ? ? ? * , and references therein ) . in their scenario , the quark",
    " hadron phase transition does not happen shortly after core collapse and is not the cause of the supernova explosion .",
    "instead a regular neutrino - driven supernova explosion occurs first and leads to a deleptonized neutron star with low-@xmath4 and a steep density gradient at the surface .",
    "their scenario of a  quark - novae \" , occurring via a quark  hadron phase transition in an existing neutron star , is reported to produce @xmath0-process elements via the prompt ejection of extremely neutron - rich material from the neutron star surface . in this sense ,",
    "quark - novae differ from the scenario explored in the current study .",
    "they result in a more compact object already in @xmath119-equilibrium , such that the expansion timescale of the ejected material is much faster , compared to the scenario discussed in the present paper .",
    "however , in @xcite the authors apply a very simplified description for the quark ",
    "hadron phase transition and ignore neutrino transport in general , as well as weak processes in the hadronic part of their neutron star",
    ". the latter may be essential for producing neutrinos which may change @xmath4 during shock passage and hence lead to different nucleosynthesis results than what has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "it remains to be shown if the obtained favorable conditions for the @xmath0-process will remain , applying more sophisticated input physics .",
    "given our results described above , we conclude that supernova explosions triggered via the quark ",
    "hadron phase transition during the early post - bounce phase can contribute to a weak @xmath0-process , consistent with observations of low - metallicity stars @xcite and with lepp abundances @xcite .",
    "such conditions apparently do not occur in regular core - collapse supernovae . however , strong @xmath0-process conditions , which also produce the third @xmath0-process peak and the actinides , have in simulations only materialized in neutron star mergers @xcite , fast rotating core - collapse supernovae with strong magnetic fields and jet ejecta @xcite or accretion disks around black holes @xcite . for the explosion model discussed here , investigation of uncertainties in the hydrodynamics and",
    "the nuclear physics input showed that a strong @xmath0-process to produce up to the third peak elements is rarely possible to obtain .",
    "neutron star mergers have been shown to be powerful sources of @xmath0-process matter , in fact ejecting a factor of @xmath23  @xmath30 more @xmath0-process material than required on average from core - collapse supernovae , if those would have to explain solar @xmath0-process abundances .",
    "this would actually support the large scatter of eu / fe in comparison to , e.g. , o , mg , si , s , and ca / fe , where the latter are clearly produced in supernovae .",
    "the only problem is that it might be hard to explain the early appearance of @xmath0-process matter for metallicities at and below @xmath120}=-3 $ ] .",

    "some recent studies , which include the fact that our galaxy is possibly the result from smaller merging subsystems ( with different star formation rates ) have been expected to show a way out of this dilemma .",
    "if this can not solved , we need another strong @xmath0-process source already at low metallicities , and possibly jets from rotating core collapses with strong magnetic fields could be the solution ( see , e.g , * ? ? ?",
