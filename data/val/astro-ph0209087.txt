    "this is important in the case of , because we can study the physical state of the x - ray nebula in detail , and obtain much more accurate elemental abundance measurements than with a ccd spectrometer .",

    "there are a number of strong emission lines , including k - shell lines of hydrogenic and helium - like si , s , ar , ca and fe .",
    "there is also an iron k fluorescence line from neutral iron in the optical nebula . as found using the _ chandra _  hetgs spectrum , a two temperature model gives a significantly better fit to the epic mos spectrum than a one temperature model .",
    "we only fit the data from @xmath11 in order to include only emission from the star and to exclude emission from the nebula .",
    "the results of the fit are shown in table  [ tabepic ] ; abundances are quoted relative to solar @xcite .",
    "we assume a distance of 2.3 kpc in determining the luminosity @xcite .",

    "@xcite found that s is marginally overabundant , while si and fe were solar within the errors .",
    "however , the inferred abundances may have systematic errors as a result of fitting a two temperature model to what is likely a continuous distribution of temperatures ( for the both the _ chandra _  and the epic data ) .",

    "there are two main results from the analysis of the rgs spectrum of .",
    "the first is a constraint on the range of temperatures in the nebula ( @xmath13 ) , which allows us to infer shock velocities for the expansion of the ejecta into the surrounding medium .",
    "the second is a lower limit on the nitrogen to oxygen abundance ratio ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this allows us to constrain the evolution of .",
    "the upper end of the temperature distribution is strongly constrained by the fe l - shell spectrum .",
    "the lack of measureable emission from charge states higher than rules out the presence of appreciable quantities of gas above @xmath14 . the lower end of the distribution appears to be flat , based on the emission from , and . however , there are no other potentially observable spectral lines originating from ions that exist at lower temperatures than , so the emission measure distribution can not be constrained below about 0.2 kev",
    ". @xcite find uv emission lines from through in the spectra of the ejecta , so there is certainly a range of temperatures present . as noted in the previous section , a substantial difference between the assumed absorption and the real absorption could change the overall shape of the emission measure distribution , especially at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite attempt to correlate the observed projected velocity of optical blobs which are spatially coincident with x - ray emission using hubble space telescope and rosat hri images .",
    "the velocities they find in the brightest x - ray regions would produce plasma at temperatures an order of magnitude higher than observed , assuming that the ejecta was colliding with a stationary ism . of course",
    ",  should be surrounded by a wind blown bubble out to much larger radii than 0.3  pc ( the radius of the x - ray nebula ) , and the material inside the bubble should be streaming outward .",
    "it seems likely that the observed shock temperature reflects the velocity at which the x - ray emitting ejecta are overtaking the previously emitted stellar wind .",
    "the temperature range @xmath13 implies a shock velocity range of @xmath15 . if the x - ray emitting ejecta date from the great eruption of 1843 , then the rough expansion velocity for a free expansion is @xmath16 , so the velocity of the stellar wind before the great eruption was @xmath17 .",
    "the n / o ratio observed in the ejecta has implications for the evolution of .",
    "it is clearly a signature of cno processing , and the degree of conversion of oxygen to nitrogen observed in the ejecta is high .",
    "all massive main - sequence stars burn hydrogen on the cno cycle .",
    "its nucleosynthetic signatures are the conversion of most of the catalytic carbon and oxygen to nitrogen , and the burning of h into he . for cno",
    "processed material to be observed on the surface of these stars , or in their ejecta , it must be transported there from the core .",
    "previous measurements of n / o in  give similar but generally less constraining results than our rgs measurements .",
    "optical and uv spectroscopy of the s condensation ( corresponding spatially roughly to the brightest x - ray knot @xcite ) shows that most cno is nitrogen and that the helium mass fraction is @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "a quantitative measurement of the cno abundance ratios is not made because of their dependence on ionization and thermal structure , and also because some oxygen and carbon may be in solid grains .",
    "it should be noted that the measured value of the helium mass fraction may be systematically too low if the ionization balance of helium was not properly modelled .",
    "more recent measurements of the abundances in the s condensation have been made by @xcite with hst - fos .",
    "they report cno and he abundances for the s2 and s3 `` sub - condensations '' , respectively , of @xmath19}>1.72,1.75 $ ] , @xmath20}>1.95,1.85 $ ] , and @xmath21 .",
    "they did detect weak oxygen and carbon lines , but treated them as upper limits due to potential contamination from the foreground region .",
    "however , they also find that preliminary analysis of the s1 and s4 sub - condensation spectra show much lower n and he enrichment , with correspondingly lower n / o and n / c ratios .",
    "previous x - ray observations @xcite have shown the presence of a strong ly  @xmath5 feature in the spectrum , but the ccd spectra lacked the resolution to strongly constrain the and features .",
    "our measurement of n / o is not limited by the spectral resolution of rgs , but rather by source / background contamination , and the observed line strength is not influenced by the formation of dust grains or large uncertainties in the temperature distribution of the plasma .",
    "recent hst - stis long - slit spectroscopy of the central star have obtained a lower limit of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this is a conservative interpretation of the data ; the lower limit could easily be taken to be an order of magnitude higher . on the other hand , uv spectra taken with hst - ghrs show evidence for moderate carbon depletion which may be inconsistent with the level of depletion found in the ejecta @xcite . in light of recent work indicating that  may be a binary system @xcite , the apparent contradiction in the stellar and nebular abundances is taken to be an indication that the star producing the carbon features is actually the secondary ( assuming the star that produced the nebula is the primary ) .",
    "@xcite points out that there are several difficulties with this conclusion , the most obvious being the concealment of the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) primary .",
    "spectroscopic measurements of the abundances of the central star can not invalidate the rgs abundance measurements , but the binary scenario requires us to treat the nebular abundances with some care .",
    "it is unlikely that both members of a binary system could contribute substantially to the ejecta around , but it is possible , in principle , that the ejecta from the primary could mix with the wind of the secondary .",
    "if both stars had a high n / o ratio , but substantially different helium abundances , then it would be possible to misinterpret the significance of the nebular abundances . however , this is not a likely scenario , so we make the simplest assumption , which is that the observed nebular abundances reflect the current surface abundances of the primary .    the signatures of cno processing have been observed in various types of hot stars , including obn stars , blue supergiants , and lbvs @xcite .",
    "however , cno processed material is not observed on the surface of all hot stars , and the amount of processed material observed spans a wide range . the fact that n / o is so high in the ejecta of  is strongly constraining , regardless of the mechanism responsible for mixing .",
    "the two most plausible mechanisms which could have resulted in the measured abundances in the ejecta of  are : 1 . )",
    "is on the main sequence and is rotating .",
    "this rotation has caused very thorough mixing .",
    "2 . )  is in a post - red - supergiant blue supergiant phase , and the cno abundance ratios are a result of the onset of convection in the envelope during the red supergiant phase .",
    "we refer in particular to the discussion in @xcite , which deals with the same question in the case of other lbv nebulae .",
    "we can use the measured n / o ratio in conjunction with the he abundance of @xcite to assess the plausibility of these two mechanisms .    using figure 3 of @xcite for the case of an @xmath23 star with @xmath24",
    ", we find that for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , or @xmath27 .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that although a high surface ratio of n / o can be obtained in the red supergiant phase , this can only happen if the star lost enough of its envelope on the main sequence to allow core processed material to dominate the resulting composition .",
    "this value of y is not consistent with the @xcite measurement of @xmath28 , although a conservative assessment of the possible errors , particularly in measuring the helium mass fraction , does not allow us to rule out that  could be a post - red - supergiant object .",
    "@xcite make predictions for the abundances of rotating massive stars .",
    "their @xmath24 model with an initial rotation velocity of @xmath29 and a mass of @xmath30 predicts @xmath31 and @xmath32 at the end of h - burning . while this value of y is also not consistent with the observed value , in this case y",
    "will clearly be lower earlier in the life of the star , whereas if the mixing is efficient enough , n / o will already be high enough to be consistent with the measured lower limit .",
    "this is an important point ; the conversion of oxygen to nitrogen in cno burning is considerably slower than the conversion of carbon to nitrogen .",
    "if rotational mixing is responsible for the observed abundances , the mixing timescale must be short compared to the evolutionary timescale . as pointed out in @xcite , the ratio of the mixing timescale to the main sequence lifetime in rapidly rotating stars is indeed expected to decrease with increasing mass .",
    "we have analyzed xmm - newton x - ray spectra of .",
    "the epic spectral data from the star are consistent with past observations by _ asca _ and _ chandra_. the data are not consistent with an isothermal plasma , but require at least two temperatures .",
    "the rgs spectra show that the nebula is nonisothermal and has strongly non - solar cno abundances .",
    "the temperature range in the nebula is @xmath33 .",
    "if this is interpreted as a shock velocity , it corresponds to @xmath34 .",
    "we find a lower limit of @xmath35 , which is indicative of very thorough mixing in the envelope of .",
    "taken with previous measurements of the surface helium abundance @xmath28 , this implies that  is a main - sequence object with some strong mixing mechanism at work , although it does not decisively rule out the possibility that it is a post - red - supergiant object .",
