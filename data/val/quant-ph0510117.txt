    "surprisingly , despite of the remarkable pragmatical successes of quantum theory , there is still an unsettled debate concerning the physical status of its main ingredient , that is the wave function . roughly speaking , there are two main attitudes toward this foundational issue @xcite .",
    "the first cult considers that the wave function has no physical reality at all .",
    "they assume the wave function as the representation of _ our knowledge _ about the physical reality rather than to refer to the reality itself .",
    "this interpretation then regards quantum theory as a theory concerning our knowledge about the reality obtained through experiment rather than a theory about physical reality .",
    "it is developed by bohr and heisenberg and commonly known as copenhagen interpretation .",
    "this line of thought eventually led to the _ probabilistic view _ of wave function through born s rule @xcite .",
    "the second attitude is to consider the wave function as a real _ physical field _ referring directly to the physical object being described , like say electromagnetic field .",
    "there are many interpretation of quantum theory which attribute such a physical status to the wave function . the mostly mentioned interpretations which support this view includes the axiomatic - most-``used '' standard interpretation of dirac - von neumann @xcite , the bohmian mechanics @xcite , many worlds interpretation @xcite , the theory of spontaneous localization @xcite , etc .",
    "the less mentioned one is de broglie s theory of double solutions @xcite . in his attempt to solve the dual nature of matter as particle and wave",
    ", he was searching for a _ nonlinear wave equation _ which assumes a non - dispersive soliton solution at the amplitude which is sufficiently high , while possesses a linear solution satisfying a linear superposition at the amplitude which is weak .",
    "he then proposed that the soliton part should be regarded as a particle which is guided by the linear part of the solution .",
    "this idea eventually led him to derive his famous guiding principle : @xmath0 which relates the energy - momentum @xmath1 of the particle with the angular frequency - wave number @xmath2 of the linear wave .",
    "equations ( [ de broglie guidance relation ] ) can be argued as the most important principle of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "partly inspired by those relations , schrdinger developed his celebrated equation . yet in contrast to de broglie s original idea , schrdinger equation is linear with respect to the wave function . in this theory ,",
    "a free particle is then usually represented by a plane wave satisfying the relations of eqs .",
    "( [ de broglie guidance relation ] ) . despite",
    "physically vague , the plane wave representation surprisingly works for all pragmatical purposes @xcite .",
    "yet one can argue that the successes of this representation relies heavily on the above de broglie s relation @xcite .",
    "it is apparently the pragmatical successes of the linear schrdinger equation if combined with the born s rule that eventually discourage people from further continuing de broglie s program @xcite . in this paper , by considering a mass - less relativistic _ linear _ schrdinger equation , we shall show that it has a new class of soliton solutions with properties exactly envisioned long time ago by de broglie .",
    "let us consider a closed system whose state is uniquely determined by a complex - valued wave function in spacetime , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",
    "further , let us assume that the wave function satisfies the following manifestly covariant mass - less schrdinger equation @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is some affine parameter , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are dalembertian operator and flat minkowskian metric , respectively .",
    "( [ covariant schroedinger equation ] ) has been proposed to interpret the klein - gordon equation through a particle model @xcite .",

    "( [ wave number vs support ] ) , which is coming from the boundary condition at the blowing - up point , one has @xmath221 hence the width in the @xmath222axis is proportional to the inverse of the @xmath222part of the wave number of the spatial quantum amplitude . to see its relation with directly observable quantities , it is convenient to define the following quantity : @xmath223 it depends on the angular frequency of the quantum amplitude and also on mass . in the case",
    "when the internal vibration resonates inside the spatio - temporal support in its first mode , the denominator is equal to the absolute value of the momentum of the particle to give : @xmath224    next , let us discuss the temporal width of the soliton wave function defined similarly by : @xmath225 .",
    "again , using the relation @xmath226 of eq .",
    "( [ angular frequency vs support ] ) , one gets @xmath227 similarly , notice that if the internal vibration beats inside the spatio - temporal support in its first mode , the denominator is just equal to the energy @xmath180 to give us @xmath228",
    "now let us proceed to discuss the implication of the linearity of the schrdinger equation of eq .",
    "( [ covariant schroedinger equation ] ) . recall that the soliton wave function given in eq .",
    "( [ de broglie wave function 2 ] ) can be interpreted as the wave function of a single free particle with a given mass @xmath158 , energy @xmath180 and momentum @xmath229 . since the schrdinger equation of eq .",
    "( [ covariant schroedinger equation ] ) is linear with respect to the wave function , then any superposition of the solutions of the type given in eq .",
    "( [ de broglie wave function 2 ] ) will also satisfy the schrdinger equation .",
    "for example , let us assume that @xmath230 , @xmath231 takes the soliton form given in eq ( [ de broglie wave function 2 ] ) with the mass @xmath232 , energy - momentum @xmath233 , @xmath231 .",
    "then , the following wave function which is obtained by superposing the two solitons wave functions : @xmath234 also satisfies the schrdinger equation of eq .",
    "( [ covariant schroedinger equation ] ) .",
    "here @xmath235 , @xmath231 are two complex - valued constants which satisfy : @xmath236 .",
    "one can thus interpret each soliton term on the right hand side as describing a particle with various values of masses , energies and momenta .",
    "notice that at period of time when the spatio - temporal support of both solitons wave functions are overlapping , one will observe interference in space and time .",
    "hence it is impossible to distinguish one soliton from the other .",
    "one therefore should consider both as a single particle .",
    "now let us assume that @xmath237 , namely each soliton is moving with direction opposite to the movement of the other . then at sufficiently large time @xmath149",
    ", the two solitons are no more overlapping in space so that one can already distinguish one from the other",
    ". both might however still overlap in time domain .",
    "if further one chooses @xmath238 , then at sufficiently large proper time , both soliton will also separate in time axis .",
    "notice also that both solitons move independently from the other .",
    "one can thereby calculate the total mass , @xmath239 , to obtain @xmath240 this can be shown easily by choosing proper time @xmath149 so that both solitons are not overlapping in spacetime so that one has @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is the average quantum potential of soliton @xmath231 .",
    "hence , the manifestly covariant schrdinger equation of eq .",
    "( [ covariant schroedinger equation ] ) can be seen as field theory in which a particle of mass @xmath239 can break into two particles of masses @xmath243 and @xmath244 so that @xmath245 .",
    "each particle moves independently with momentum @xmath246 and possessing energy @xmath247 , where @xmath231 .",
    "moreover , since energy and momentum must be conserved then one can define the total energy - momentum as @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "conversely , since the schrdinger equation of eq .",
    "( [ covariant schroedinger equation ] ) is time reversal , then by reversing the evolution of affine parameter , the initially separated two solitons each describing a particle of mass @xmath232 , @xmath231 , can merge into a single particle with mass @xmath250 .",
    "needless to say , extension into the superposition of more than two solitons are straight forward .",
    "we have thus shown that first , the manifestly covariant mass - less schrdinger equation of eq .",
    "( [ covariant schroedinger equation ] ) possesses a class of non - dispersive soliton solutions with finite - size spatio - temporal support .",
    "the quantum amplitude inside the support satisfies klein - gordon equation with finite emergent mass .",
    "we finally came to give an interpretation to the soliton solution as describing a single particle with finite mass , energy and momentum .",
    "moreover , we showed that the soliton solution possesses internal spatio - temporal vibration with angular frequency and wave number which are determined by the energy - momentum of the particle as exactly conjectured by de broglie while proposing the solution for the problem of duality of matter as both particle and wave .",
    "however , in contrast to his envision of _ nonlinear wave equation _ assuming soliton solution , we showed that our soliton wave function is a solution of a _ linear wave equation_. we argued that the fact that the soliton wave function has finite extension in spacetime might give the key to the problematic divergence problem encountered in the current version of quantum field theory and also to the paradox of particle self - interference in double slits experiment .",
    "we showed that if the internal vibration resonates inside the spatio - temporal support , then one can show that the energy and momentum are discretized into packets as assumed by planck and einstein .",
    "we further suggested that this situation appears if there is interaction among matters which induces transfer of energy .",
    "we also showed that the classical energy - momentum relation is recovered when the internal vibration resonates inside the spatio - temporal support in its first excited mode .",
    "this opens the possibility of violating the energy - momentum relation if one moves away from the first resonance mode .",
    "next , the linearity of the schrdinger equation allows for superposition of such solutions to further comprise a class of many solitons solutions .",
    "each term of the superposition then describes a single particle with a given mass , energy and momentum , moving independently of the other .",
    "one can thus consider the wave function as a real physical field and regards the schrdinger equation of eq .",
    "( [ covariant schroedinger equation ] ) as a field theory describing multi - particles systems . in this theory",
    ", things thus live in the ordinary three dimensional space rather than in configuration space .",
    "there are at least three other interesting issues suggest further exploration .",
    "first , we have identified soliton as particle by attributing to it mass and energy - momentum .",
    "it is then natural to ask : what about spin ?",
    "second , since the soliton wave function is broadened also in time axis , then it might be possible to see interference in the time domain @xcite .",
    "finally third , our theory allows us to construct a superposition of two solitons which initially interferes each other but then is separated from each other as time goes .",
    "it is then interesting to employ this idea to re - think the epr thought experiment ."
