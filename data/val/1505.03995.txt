    "pressure has been recognized as one of the most important parameters in study of condensed matter physics .",
    "the pressure effect is studied by a variety of method such as electrical resistivity , magnetic susceptibility , specific heat , x - ray or neutron diffraction , nmr , inelastic neutron scattering and so on . among them",
    "high - pressure esr is useful to investigate the pressure effect of the magnetic material from the microscopic point of view .",
    "most of the reported high - pressure esr systems @xcite except our and nfrdi s @xcite systems are equipped with resonator and only one frequency is available in principal , while the sensitivity is higher than our systems .",
    "exceptionally , a method using the combination of the resonator and the plastic diamond anvil cell has been developed very recently @xcite . in its case ,",
    "the multifrequency measurement can be done by using the higher resonant modes in addition to the fundamental mode . however , the frequency region is limited in the 40 - 160 ghz frequency region , though the pressure reaches above 2 gpa . nfrdi",

    "whose system is a similar type with us started their development later than us and they have the system with the maximum field up to 16 t , the pressure region up to 1.6 gpa and the frequency region from 105 to 420 ghz @xcite .    on the other hand , in our systems the frequency",
    "can be varied very widely , which includs the so - called thz region defined as the frequency region from 0.1 to 10 thz @xcite , since we simply combine the piston - cylinder pressure cells with the transmission - type high - field esr system using the pulsed high magnetic field @xcite or the static magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the most characteristic point of our pressure cell is that all inner parts are made of sapphire and zro@xmath0-based ceramic .",
    "they have both the toughness and the transmission in the thz region , and this enables us to observe the transmitted light through the pressure cell in the wide frequency region .",
    "the energy of the electromagnetic wave in this frequency region matches well the energy between the ground state and the low - lying excited states of the quantum spin systems .",
    "therefore , our high - pressure esr systems have proved to be one of the most powerful means to study quantum spin systems @xcite .",
    "so far , we developed the pressure cell with the moderate pressure range below 1 gpa and the wide frequency region from 70 to 700 ghz @xcite , and that with the higher pressure range up to 1.5 gpa and the limited frequency region from 70 to 400 ghz @xcite .",
    "recently , we also developed a hybrid - type pressure cell with larger sample space and higher pressure region for large bore magnet , which covers the frequency region form 50 to 400 ghz and the pressure up to 2.5 gpa @xcite . in order to achieve the high pressure and the wide frequency region simultaneously , the key factors are the toughness and the transmission property of the inner parts of the pressure cell . in this paper , we describe the survey of several ceramics for the inner parts . on the basis of this survey we tried new ceramic for the inner parts and we succeeded in extending the frequency region up to 700 ghz for the hybrid - type pressure cell .",

    "it is well known as a shastry - sutherland model compound which has an orthogonal dimer structure in two - dimensional plane @xcite .",
    "it shows a unique temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility and the ground state is the singlet . from the fitting of this temperature dependence of the susceptibility with the theoretical calculation ,",
    "the exchange interaction within dimer @xmath2 85 k and that between dimers @xmath3 54 k were estimated @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the system is believed to be located near the phase boundary of the ratio @xmath4 between the interdimer and intradimer exchange interactions @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "the quantum critical point @xmath5 was @xmath6 and it was considered that there were only two phases of the dimer singlet phase ( @xmath7 ) and the nel phase ( @xmath8 ) at the beginning @xcite . however , recent more detailed calculation for the shastry - sutherland model with the intradimer and interdimer exchange interactions by the series expansions has predicted that there exists an intermediate phase between these two phases @xcite .",
    "it is the plaquette singlet phase ( @xmath9 ) as shown in fig .",

    "moreover , the numerical exact diagonalization for the more realistic model with the interdimer dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction in addition to these exchange interactions not only observed the anomaly in the @xmath10 dependence of the gap energy around this predicted critical value @xmath11 but also explained the zero - field splitting of the direct esr transition modes very well @xcite . since the system has the ratio @xmath12 and it lies just below the critical point , it will provide an opportunity to study the quantum critical transition if the ratio can be controlled .",
    "this has stimulated the study of the pressure effect on this system .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility measurements up to 0.7 gpa suggested the suppression of the gap energy between the ground state and the first excited states with the pressure @xcite , and we revealed the suppression of gap directly up to 1 gpa from the high - pressure esr @xcite .",
    "the nmr measurement at 2.4 gpa suggested the existence of the pressure - induced new phase where the magnetic and nonmagnetic sites coexist @xcite .",
    "moreover , the x - ray measurement suggested the complete collapse of the gap energy at 2 gpa and the quantum phase transition around at this pressure followed by the appearance of a new phase @xcite .",
    "however , the extrapolation of the pressure dependence of gap obtained from our previous esr measurement up to 1 gpa suggested that the gap still remains at 2 gpa @xcite .",
    "this fact is pretty controversial with the x - ray study . in this study , we extended the pressure range of the esr measurement of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 above 1.5 gpa successfully and we will show that the gap energy remains open certainly at 2 gpa .",

    "the transmitted light trough the sample is detected by insb detector set at the bottom of the light pipe .",
    "the output of bwo is chopped mechanically with the frequency of several hundreds hz and the output signal from the detector is amplified by the lock - in amplifier using the chopping frequency as the reference signal .",
    "the detailed set up can be seen in ref .",
    "21 and 22 . for the transmission measurement of the ceramics , we measured the transmission intensity of the sample by the above setup without field",
    ". bwo is controlled by a pc through the ad converter and the frequency sweep measurement can be done .",
    "the transmittance can be obtained by dividing the transmission intensity with sample by that without sample .",
    "although the output intensity of bwo has large frequency dependence , its reproducibility is high and the reliable transmittance can be obtained if the optical axis is maintained during the sample exchange .",
    "the sample ceramic has a cylindrical shape whose diameter and length are 12 mm and 30 mm , respectively .",
    "the length corresponds to the total length of the inner parts used in the pressure cell .",
    "all transmission measurements have been done at 4.2 k and in the frequency region from 330 to 530 ghz .",
    "the high - pressure esr measurements of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 have also been performed by the same setup .",
    "the pressure cell including sample is connected to the light pipe so that the sample is located at the center of the magnet .",
    "a rectangular shape single crystal @xmath13 mm@xmath14 with its long axis along the @xmath15 axis was used .",
    "the esr measurements have been done at 2 k in the frequency region from 300 to 800 ghz .",
    "the pressure cell is the hybrid - type piston - cylinder cell .",
    "we used the inner parts made of the zro@xmath0-based ceramic and the al@xmath0o@xmath1 ceramic to achieve the transmission and the higher pressure simultaneously as is discribed later .",
    "the maximum pressure was 1.51 gpa in this study .",
    "the pressure was estimated from the load at room temperature by using the quadratic calibration curve of the load with the pressure around 3 k , which was obtained by the change of the superconducting transition temperature of tin .",

    "however , the zro@xmath0-based ceramic does not have enough transmission especially for the higher frequency region @xcite . in order to achieve the higher pressure and the wider frequency measurement simultaneously , finding",
    "a new material for the inner parts is an important factor .",
    "the zro@xmath0-based ceramic , which is known as the partially stabilized zirconia , is believed to have particular fracture toughness as compared with other ceramics in general .",
    "table [ tab1 ] shows the examined ceramics in this study .",
    "all ceramics except fca10 are the zro@xmath0-based ceramic and fca10 is made of only al@xmath0o@xmath1 . in this table",
    "the main components , their contents and the fracture toughness values @xmath16 are also shown , which are extracted from their data sheets .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the frequency dependence of the transmittance of these ceramics .",
    "all data are fitted well by a function @xmath22 , where @xmath15 and @xmath23 are the fitting parameter , and @xmath24 is the frequency .",
    "the obtained parameter @xmath23 is also listed in table [ tab1 ] . as is seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and the obtained parameter @xmath23 in table [ tab1 ] , the transmittance has large component dependence .",
    "first , we focus on the difference of the transmittance for the series of fca10 , fcy40a and fcy20a , which have different al@xmath0o@xmath1 contents and they are 100 , 40 and 20 , respectively , as shown by open symbols in fig .",
    "fca10 shows the highest transmission among the examined ceramics and also shows little frequency dependence .",
    "however , the transmittance is decreased as the al@xmath0o@xmath1 content is decreased .",
    "moreover , the decrease of the transmittance with the frequency is remarkable as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which is also apparent in the fitting parameter @xmath23 shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "this fact suggests that zro@xmath0 has higher absorption in this frequency region than al@xmath0o@xmath1 .",

    "next , from the comparison of fcy40a and z206n , whose admixture is y@xmath0o@xmath1 , it was found that they have almost the same transmittance in spite of the amount of zro@xmath0 , where the zro@xmath0 content is 60 % for fcy20a and 95 % for z206n .",
    "moreover , from the comparison of z206n and z201n , the higher transmittance in z206n can be seen , though the zro@xmath0 content in z206n is higher than z201n .",
    "this fact may suggest that there exist other factors for the absorption of the electromagnetic wave in addition to the amount of zro@xmath0",
    ". they might be the admixture itself , the vacancy whose species and amount probably depend on the manufacturing process sensitively , admixtures which are not disclosed , and so on .",
    "the transmittance of z220 , whose admixture is mgo , is extremely low as compared with that of z206n , which has almost the same amount of zro@xmath0 with z220 . from this comparison , it is also suggested that the transmittance is very sensitive to the admixture .",
    "it was also found that there is tradeoff tendency between the fracture toughness and the transmittance in thz region .",
    "that is , the tougher material tends to have the lower transmittance .",
    "the most balanced one is z206n or fcy20a .",

    "moreover , fcy20a is easier to obtain commercially .",
    "figure [ pcell ] shows the cross section of the hybrid - type pressure cell for esr measurement @xcite .",

    "when two pistons are replaced by those made of fca10 , which has the highest transmission among the examined ceramics , we confirmed that the maximum pressure reaches 1.5 gpa and the frequency region can be extended up to 700 ghz successfully @xcite .",

    "the absorption lines showing the lower field side shift with the frequency and those showing the higher field side shift are assigned to the transitions from the @xmath33 to the @xmath35 state and the @xmath36 state , respectively .",
    "although such direct transition between the different spin quantum number states is generally forbidden , it becomes allowed when there exists an interaction which mixes these states . in this case , the dm interaction is considered to be responsible for this mixing @xcite , which is given as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the dm interaction between @xmath39-th and @xmath40-th spins , and @xmath41 is spin operator at @xmath39-th site .",
    "as there is no inversion symmetry between interdimer cu ions , the dm interaction exists between these ions .",
    "moreover , the @xmath42 vector is considered to be almost along the @xmath27 axis from the symmetry .",
    "the existence of the in - plane component of the interdimer dm interaction and the intradimer dm interaction can be allowed because of the small buckling of the cuo@xmath30 plane . however",

    "it is worth noting that such esr mode can be obtained by only our high - pressur and multifrequency esr system in thz region .",
    "it is clearly shown that both the upper branch and the lower branch shift to the lower energy side as the pressure is increased .",
    "it means that the energy gap between the singlet and the triplet states is suppressed by the pressure .",
    "it is also found that the frequency - field diagram obtained in this study differs from the simple diagram as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "the obtained frequency - field diagram shows the splitting at zero field and this causes the deviation from the linear field dependence of @xmath44 around zero field , where @xmath45 is the bohr magneton .",

    "finally , we comment on the x - ray measurement under pressure for this compound @xcite . since we found that the system approaches the phase boundary at 1.51 gpa from the above estimation , the transition around 2 gpa suggested by the x - ray measurement is very plausible .",
    "in contrast to this suggestion , however , it is very natural that the gap energy remains open at 2 gpa from fig .",
    "[ gp ] . in the x - ray measurement , strong spin - lattice coupling",
    "is utilized to evaluate the gap energy .",
    "that is , the lattice expansion was observed as the temperature was decreased .",
    "moreover , the temperature dependence of the reciprocal of the lattice constant scales the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "then , from the fitting to this temperature dependence of the inverse lattice constant by the simple exponential form exp@xmath83 the gap energy was obtained .",
    "this is not direct method to evaluate the gap energy and the fitting of the simple exponential form to the susceptibility is not very precise to estimate the gap energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the gap energy was directly determined in our high pressure esr measurement and it is more reliable . in x - ray measurement the linear pressure dependence of the gap energy",
    "was also found but the slope ( -14.7 k / gpa ) @xcite was much larger than that obtained in this study ( -7.5 k / gpa ) . moreover , the above speculation that the gap energy remains open at the critical value is consistent with the suggestion that the phase transition from the dimer singlet phase to the plaquette singlet phase occurs with remaining the gap open @xcite . the direct observation around 2 gpa by the high pressure esr measurement is highly desired .",
    "we investigated the zro@xmath0-based ceramics for the inner parts of the transmission - type pressure cell used in the high - pressure and multifrequency esr system . the zro@xmath0-al@xmath0o@xmath1-based ceramics fcy20a turned out to be one of the most balanced ceramics among the examined ceramics in the toughness , transmission property in thz region and the commercial availability . by using the inner parts made of only al@xmath0o@xmath1 ceramic which has the lowest toughness but the highest transmission together with fcy20a",
    ", we successfully reached the pressure of 1.5 gpa and extended the frequency region to 700 ghz simultaneously .",
    "we performed the high - pressure esr measurement of the shastry - sutherland compound srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 .",
    "we succeeded in observing the direct esr transition mode between the singlet ground state and the triplet excited states up to 1.51 gpa .",
    "the precise pressure dependence of the gap energy was obtained directly and it was proved that the gap energy is reduced by the pressure linearly . moreover ,",
    "the deviation of the direct esr transition mode from the linear field dependence around zero field and the splitting between the upper and lower branches at zero field are clarified by the multifrequency esr measurement in the wide range . from the comparison of the obtained pressure dependence of the gap energy with the theoretical result obtained by cpas _",
    "@xcite , it was found that the ratio of the exchange interactions @xmath10 and the interdimer exchange interaction @xmath70 are increased by the pressure under the assumption that the intradimer exchange interaction @xmath58 is constant .",
    "moreover , the ratio @xmath10 reaches 0.68 at 1.51 gpa and it was suggested that the system approaches the quantum critical point .",
    "the dm interaction was also suggested to increase by the pressure and this is consistent with the result of the pressure dependence of the splitting value at zero field .      00 for a review , sakurai , t. ; fujimoto , k. ; goto , r. ; okubo , s. ; ohta , h. ; uwatoko , y. development of high - pressure and high - field esr system using squid magnetometer .",
