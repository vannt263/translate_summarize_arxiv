    "with the prospect of non - abelian anyons and the potential application of topologically protected qubits@xcite there has been a renewed interest in exotic fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states , especially the experimentally easiest accessible state at filling fraction @xmath0.@xcite in 1991 , two different non - abelian fqh states were proposed both at filling fraction @xmath4 ( or @xmath0).@xcite this raised an very interesting possibility that the observed @xmath0 state may be a non - abelian state .",
    "one of the proposed states , the moore - read pfaffian wavefunction,@xcite has received a lot of attention recently , both in experiment and in theory .",
    "however , it is currently still unclear what the true nature of the @xmath0 bulk state is ; many candidate states , or trial wavefunctions , exist , some of which predict non - abelian statistics , others predict less exotic abelian statistics.@xcite we briefly review these candidates .",
    "experimentally the bulk state can be probed through transport measurements on the edge , for instance through tunneling between fqh edges induced by a quantum point contact ( qpc).@xcite the different candidate states make specific predictions for the charge @xmath5 and exponent @xmath6 of the tunneling quasiparticles , and these can in principal be measured in experiment . in the regime of weak",
    "tunneling at sharp edges , chiral luttinger liquid ( @xmath7ll ) theory@xcite describes the form of e.g. the differential tunneling conductance and the tunneling current noise as a function of temperature and applied bias , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 as continuously - varying fitting parameters .",
    "very recently two experimental groups reported results on tunneling across a qpc in the @xmath0 state ; ref .",
    "focusses on scaling of the differential conductance , ref .",
    "measures shot - noise .",
    "the results are most consistent with a quasiparticle charge @xmath8 and exponent @xmath2 .    in this paper",
    "we introduce two other candidates for the @xmath0 fqh _",
    "edge_. first , starting from the existing so - called ` anti - pfaffian ' bulk state,@xcite we consider interactions between the counterpropagating edge modes .",
    "as we change the interaction strength , we find that there is a transition to a new phase on the edge , with different values for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "note that this is really a phase transition on the edge , since the bulk state does not change . by appropriately tuning the edge interactions",
    "one should be able to observe this quantum phase transition through e.g. a change in @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we call this new phase the ` majorana - gapped ' phase , as the anti - pfaffian majorana mode becomes gapped",
    ". the majorana - gapped phase has 2 and 1/2 right - moving edge branches and 1 left - moving edge branches , while the standard edge phase for the anti - pfaffian state has 3 right - moving edge branches and 1 and 1/2 left - moving edge branches . during the transition from the standard edge phase to the majorana - gapped phase , half a left - moving edge branch ( a majorana fermion mode ) pairs up with half a right - moving edge branch and this opens up an energy gap .",
    "second , we start with the edge reconstructed@xcite pfaffian bulk state , which has @xmath9 and @xmath10 branches of right movers and @xmath11 branch of left movers . such an edge can also undergo a phase transition into a majorana - gapped phase which has @xmath9 branches of right movers and @xmath10 branch of left movers .",
    "the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be changed by the phase transition .",
    "we mean that another quasiparticle with a different charge becomes the most dominant quasiparticle which is observed in experiments . the phase transition does not change the fixed charge @xmath5 of a given quasiparticle ; it can change the exponent @xmath6 for all quasiparticles . ]",
    "the above result is for the clean edge . in the presence of impurities",
    ", the picture is different . in that case , as we change the interaction strength between different edge branches beyond a threshold , a right - moving majorana fermion mode pairs up with a left - moving majorana fermion mode and they become localized .",
    "if we assume that the localized modes do not contribute to tunneling between the edges , then we can treat those localized modes as if they are gapped . under this assumption ,",
    "the clean edge and dirty edge behave similarly .",
    "we like to stress that in order to have the gapping or the localization phase transition , it is necessary to include the supposedly completely filled lowest landau level in the framework , or to include the additional edge branches from the edge reconstruction .",
    "the new phases require that the different edge modes have substantial interactions with each other .",
    "numerical simulations for small - size closed systems @xcite , which by construction ignore edge effects , suggested that the moore - read pfaffian trial wavefunction is the most likely candidate for the actual @xmath0 fqh bulk state . to compare with actual experiments , which obviously have an edge , it is necessary , as our examples in this paper shows , to include the edge - aspect as well .",
    "this is emphasized as well in a very recent numerical study , ref .   , which considers a disc - geometry with an edge , and a varying confining potential ;",
    "for a sharp edge the pfaffian is found to be favored , but for a smooth edge the groundstate is a different state which bears the marks of some form of edge reconstruction .",
    "the ` majorana - gapping ' transition is a quantum phase transition on the edge only which does not affect the bulk state .",
    "such a kind of edge - only quantum phase transition has been studied in ref .   .",
    "here we find a new type of edge - only quantum phase transition where we lose ( gain ) a fractional branch of right - movers ( right - movers ) through the transition .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review the different candidates for the @xmath0 state in sec .",
    "[ sec : candidatelist ] .",
    "section  [ sec : gappedantipf ] is the core of our paper .",
    "here we show that for the anti - pfaffian state there exists an operator which for certain density - density interactions becomes relevant and can drive a phase transition . in the new phase a pair of counterpropagating majorana modes becomes gapped .",
    "for the new phase we determine the quasiparticle spectrum and which of these quasiparticles is the most relevant . in sec .",

    "seven different candidates states for the @xmath0 fqh system with number of edge branches , expected quasiparticle charge @xmath5 and exponent @xmath6 for dominant tunneling quasiparticles , and exponent @xmath12 for electron operator . here",
    ", we have included the 2 right - moving branches from the underlying @xmath13 iqh state .",
    "the subscripts @xmath14 and @xmath15 indicate the left - moving and right - moving edge branches .",
    "exponent @xmath6 generally seems to be increasing with total number of edge branches .",
    "the listed electron operator exponents @xmath12 ignore the @xmath13 iqh electrons .",
    "the two majorana - gapped phases have a dominant @xmath16 quasiparticle in addition to a quarter charge quasiparticle . [",
    "tab : candidatelist ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      having determined the quasiparticle spectrum , we now look for the most dominant quasiparticles .    as far as ( non-)universality goes , the gapping of the pair of majorana modes has removed one pair of counterpropagating bosonic modes from the system , and with it one boost - parameter .",
    "two counterpropagating pairs remain with corresponding boost parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "and so in principle we now have to repeat our procedure of looking for dominant charge - transfer operators on the disc @xmath19 .",
    "however , so far we have considered the most general density - density interaction @xmath20 .",
    "we expect the interaction to show traces of the underlying coulomb interaction ; especially , we expect that there will be a single charge mode which will separate itself from the other ( neutral ) modes .    here",
    "we will consider the limit where the charged mode is completely separated from the neutral modes .",
    "this decouples one of the right - moving bosonic modes from the left - moving one and eliminates one boost parameter .",
    "the condition for charge - separation is @xmath21 .",
    "the one remaining boost parameter is @xmath17 , with @xmath22 .",
    "so we continue our analysis of scaling dimensions of operators on the line @xmath17 . a plot of scaling dimensions for several quasiparticle operators is given in fig  [ fig : deltaline ] . upon closer inspection though",
    ", there is some regularity in the spectrum .",
    "for instance , charge - transfer operators can have a minimal scaling dimension of one , which is obtained for @xmath23 which appears to form an on - going series , and in between such points the same ` spectrum ' of scaling dimensions is repeated .    .",
    "plotted are charge - transfer operators with scaling dimension @xmath24 ( dashed blue lines ) , electron operator with lowest scaling dimension ( solid green line ) , and two operators with lowest scaling dimension of all operators : a charge @xmath25 quasiparticle ( dashed - dotted red line ) and a charge @xmath26 quasiparticle ( solid blue line ) .",
    "notice that there is a pattern which repeats itself for @xmath27 , turning into a series with shrinking width as @xmath17 approaches its maximum allowed value @xmath28 .",
    "note that there are many quasiparticle operators with scaling dimensions smaller than @xmath29 that we did not include on this graph .",
    "[ fig : deltaline],width=325 ]    so it seems we only need to consider the interval @xmath30 . at @xmath31 the most dominant quasiparticle operator",
    "is a charge @xmath25 @xmath32-sector operator , with scaling dimension @xmath33 . upon increasing @xmath17",
    "the scaling dimension increases monotonically to a value of @xmath34 at @xmath35 . at @xmath35 the quasiparticle operator with the lowest scaling dimension",
    "is a charge @xmath26 @xmath36-sector operator with @xmath37 .",
    "its scaling dimension increases monotonically in the opposite direction , reaching a maximum at @xmath31 of @xmath38 .",
    "it is tempting to suggest that the charge - transfer operator with the smallest scaling dimension will dominate and fix the system to be either at the @xmath31 or at the @xmath35 point .",
    "however , since both charge - transfer operators have scaling dimension between 1 and 3/2 on the interval , they are both relevant , and it depends on the strength of the coefficient if one dominates over the other .",
    "similarly , in our analysis we can not single out a most dominant quasiparticle , it is simply too close to call . in that sense",
    "we find the majorana - gapped charge - separated phase to be non - universal : there are two dominant quasiparticles , with charges of @xmath39 and @xmath10 and scaling dimensions ranging between @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "having identified the majorana - gapped phase , we can ask what kind of interaction will lead to such a phase . in the majorana - gapped charge - separated phase the interaction is characterized by 5 remaining parameters : if we pick @xmath42 as the charged mode these are the three @xmath43 eigenvalues @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , an angle @xmath47 for rotations between branches @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and the boost parameters @xmath17 .",
    "a crucial ingredient for the majorana - gapped phase is to include the two filled ( lowest ) landau level modes . if these two modes are spatially well - separated on the edge from the inner two modes one would expect the interactions to be small between these blocks of edge branches .",
    "we find that the interaction required for the majorana - gapped phase is such that this kind of separation of two modes is not possible : all right - moving branches have to interact with the left - moving branch with similar strength .",
    "the assumption we made so far was that the charge - transfer coupling strength @xmath50 was uniform along the edge .",
    "a more realistic assumption would be to consider @xmath51 to be fluctuating with position due to random disorder . also , with disorder we do not need to worry about momentum mismatch between different edge modes .    with disorder present , we expect instead of the gapping of the pair of left and right moving majorana modes , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , that they will become localized . here",
    "we will assume that the localized modes do not contribute to the tunneling between edges .",
    "in particular , they do not affect the value of exponent @xmath6 .",
    "so as long as the calculation of @xmath6 is concerned , we treat the localized modes as if the are gapped .",
    "thus the above calculation of @xmath6 also applies to the disordered edge with localization .",
    "we now apply the same mechanism of majorana gapping on a different state : the edge - reconstructed pfaffian state . by itself",
    "the pfaffian @xcite state is fully chiral and gapping of pairs of counterpropagating modes can not occur .",
    "however , the edge might be unstable towards edge reconstruction @xcite .",
    "edge reconstruction effectively adds pairs of counterpropagating charged bosonic modes to the edge . here",
    "we will analyze the state in which edge reconstruction has introduced one such pair of edge modes to the pfaffian state .",
    "in the edge - reconstructed pfaffian there are three bosonic modes @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and one neutral majorana mode @xmath52 .",
    "the left - moving branch is @xmath54 , the other branches are right - moving .",
    "the @xmath57-matrix is @xmath58 .",
    "electron operators are @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the ` null ' operator @xmath62 is a charge - transfer operator with equal left and right conformal dimensions @xmath63 . introducing boost parameters @xmath64 ,",
    "similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : boost ] ) , we can parametrize scaling dimensions of quasiparticle operators . the scaling dimension of @xmath62 becomes one at the point @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "we perform a basistransformation from @xmath67 to @xmath68 ; in this basis @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and the @xmath71 branch carries all the charge .",
    "if the null operator is relevant it will gap the right - moving majorana mode @xmath52 and half of the left - moving bosonic mode @xmath72 leaving a left - moving majorana mode @xmath73 .    in the majorana - gapped phase ,",
    "the gapless physical electron operators are @xmath74 and @xmath75 ; @xmath76 acquires a gap .",
    "the quasiparticle spectrum can be labelled by two integers @xmath77 and @xmath78 and a @xmath73 majorana sector , as follows , with charge and scaling dimension included : @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81    note that here the majorana - gapping effectively removes all pairs of counterpropagating bosonic modes that existed before .",
    "hence the scaling dimensions of all operators becomes fixed . in other words , there is no remaining boost parameter degree of freedom .    in the majorana - gapped",
    "edge - reconstructed there are _ three _ operators with smallest scaling dimension @xmath82 : one charge @xmath26 operator ( @xmath83 in @xmath36-sector ) , and two charge @xmath25 operators ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 in the @xmath32-sector ) .",
    "the electron operator with smallest scaling dimensions has @xmath86 .",
    "to detect the phase transition to the majorana - gapped phase on the edge of the anti - pfaffian state one would have to observe a change in quasiparticle tunneling exponent @xmath6 .",
    "this presents a dilemma : even though @xmath6 itself is an intrinsic property of the edge , a measurement of @xmath6 requires the quasiparticle to tunnel through the bulk .",
    "but in the bulk the phase transition does not occur , so is it even possible for the quasiparticle to tunnel ?",
    "we assume that edge quasiparticles in the majorana - gapped phase can indeed tunnel through the bulk and we do not run into obvious inconsistencies ( of e.g. having a quasiparticle charge on the edge which does not exist in the bulk ) . whether or not this assumption is fully justified is not yet understood .",
    "we like to stress that that operator @xmath87 not only appears in the edge effective hamiltonian , the corresponding operator also appears in the 2d bulk effective hamiltonian for the 2d anti - pfaffian state .",
    "such a bulk operator transfers charges between different condensates ( note that the anti - pfaffian state is formed by several condensates : the spin - down electrons in the first landau level , the spin - up electrons in the first landau level , the spin - up electrons in the second landau level , etc ) .",
    "with such an operator present in the bulk hamiltonian , one naturally expects that the 2d anti - pfaffian state has @xmath88 branches of the edge excitations .",
    "the @xmath89 branches of the edge excitations proposed in refs .   can be viewed as a result of edge reconstruction of the @xmath88 edge.@xcite      so far we have ignored the effect of spin conservation . in the presence of magnetic field , the @xmath90-component of spin @xmath91 is still conserved . by",
    "examine the spin quantum number of the charge transfer operator @xmath87 in the anti - pfaffian state , we find that it carries @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath91 conservation prevents @xmath87 from appearing in the edge hamiltonian . in this case the majorana - gapped phase for the anti - pfaffian state can not appear .",
    "thus to have the majorana - gapped phase for the anti - pfaffian state we either need to break the @xmath91 conservation , or to consider the @xmath93 anti - pfaffian state where there exists a charge transfer operator which carries @xmath94 .",
    "the charge transfer operator for the edge reconstructed pfaffian state has @xmath94 .",
    "thus the @xmath91 conservation will not prevent the appearance of the majorana - gapped phase .",
    "the majorana - gapped phase is more likely to appear for edge reconstructed pfaffian state .      glancing at table  [ tab : candidatelist ] we have to conclude that the quest to determine the nature of the observed @xmath0 fqh state is far from over .",
    "the first experimental results @xcite suggest that likely @xmath8 and @xmath95 . if these are confirmed to be the correct values we can scratch a few candidates off the list",
    "; but we would not be able to distinguish between the anti - pfaffian , @xmath96 and majorana - gapped edge - reconstructed pfaffian states .",
    "electron tunneling is expected to be the same for these three states as well .",
    "additional measurements which would probe the number of left- and right - moving edge branches would be required to settle this issue .",
    "for instance a thermal hall conductance @xcite measurement distinguishes between the three states with @xmath8 and @xmath95 .",
    "as far as the presence of non - abelian statistics goes the prospect is somewhat brighter , as five out of the seven candidate states are non - abelian",
    ". furthermore the non - abelian statistics is carried by similar ising spin fields in all these cases , hence experimental setups based on interference should give qualitatively similar results .      in the paper , we studied the effect of a charge transfer process described by neutral bosonic operators in the @xmath0 anti - pfaffian state and edge reconstructed pfaffian state . on the edge ,",
    "such operators have a form @xmath97 or @xmath62 .",
    "such operators transfer charges between edge branches and create / annihilate a majorana fermion @xmath52 . the operator respects all the symmetries and is local with respect to all the electron operators .",
    "thus such an operator is allowed in the effective edge hamiltonian .",
    "we find that , for a certain range of interactions between the edge branches , the operators @xmath97 or @xmath98 represent relevant perturbations .",
    "the effect of such a relevant perturbation opens up a gap for a pair of left and right moving majorana fermion modes .",
    "for the anti - pfaffian state , before the 1d gapping transition at the edge , the state has 3/2 branches of left - movers and 3 branches of right - movers .",
    "after the gapping transition , the same 2d anti - pfaffian state has 1 branch of left - movers and 2 and 1/2 branches of right - movers . for the edge reconstructed pfaffian state , before the 1d gapping transition at the edge , the state has 1 branches of left - movers and @xmath9 and @xmath10 branches of right - movers .",
    "after the gapping transition , the same state has @xmath10 branch of left - movers and 2 branches of right - movers .",
    "the phase transition changes the scaling dimension of quasiparticle operators on the edge , which can in principle be observed in experiment . for fqh edge states with counterpropagating edge modes",
    "it was known that interactions between the edge branches have to be taken into account to determine the phase of the edge .",
    "it was previously shown that under certain conditions a full left- and right - moving branch could pair up and open up a gap @xcite . here",
    ", we showed that half a left- and right - moving branch can pair and become gapped .",
