    "this variation is much smaller than the lateral corrugation ( @xmath79 mev in this facet ) and out - of - plane rotation ( @xmath80 mev ) .    to estimate the magnitude of the error introduced by neglecting the angular average ( that automatically is included in the experimental data ) we perform a separate calculation of h@xmath0 in an up - right position on the cu(111 ) surface using the optimal h@xmath0-to - surface separation",
    "this calculation results in a downward energy shift of 4.8 mev , which is the amplitude of the angular variation at the optimal separation .",
    "however , for an isotropic h@xmath0 wave function this shift corresponds roughly to lowering of the ground state energy by merely @xmath81 mev = 1.6 mev , assuming a simple sinusoidal energy variation in the angular space .",
    "the energy of higher order states would also be lowered , but to a lesser extent .",
    "this estimate thus indicates that the effect of the angular energy dependence is merely a minor quantitative correction to the eigenvalues .",
    "the pecs are calculated with vdw - df2 for the high - symmetry sites , and from these the laterally averaged potential @xmath36 is approximately obtained . in turn , the bound quantum states in the @xmath36 potential well are calculated by solving the corresponding schrdinger equation .",

    "to connect the two , some approximation has to be made to extract the laterally averaged result out of the discrete one .    to capture the effects of the surface topology and to use the surface - lattice points used in the dft calculations , we find the following approximate average reasonable : @xmath82 where @xmath83 for the ( 100 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces .",
    "one argument in favor of this approximation is the fact that the ( 100 ) surface has twice as many bridge sites as there are atop sites .",

    "reference uses the atop pec on cu(111 ) , which is an adequate choice due to the small corrugation of the cu(111 ) surface .    for the discussion of the relation between corrugation and @xmath35 , the classical turning point is the relevant separation .",

    "we propose that such surface - related pec benchmarking should find a broader usage .",
    "the vdw - df , vdw - df2 , dft - d3 , and ts - vdw schemes are used , and results are compared .",
    "the first two are expressions of the vdw - df method , that is , nonempirical nonlocal functionals in which the electrodynamical couplings of the plasmon response produces fully distributed contributions to vdw interactions ; like in the zaremba - kohn picture @xcite , they permit the extended conduction electrons to respond also in the density tails outside a surface . the latter two are examples of dft extended with vdw pair potentials and represent the dispersive interaction through an effective response and pair potentials located on the nuclei positions . several qualitative similarities are found between the vdw - df and vdw - df2 functionals .",
    "the vdw - df2 functional gives pecs in a useful qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental pecs .",
    "this is looked at for well depths , equilibrium separations , and curvatures of pec near the well bottom , and thus molecular zero - point vibration frequency .",
    "the dft - d3 and ts - vdw schemes give pec results that deviate significantly more from experimental pecs .",
    "the benchmark with the experimental h@xmath0/cu scattering data is thus able to discriminate between the results of pair - potential - extended dft methods and vdw - df2 .",
    "the differences suggest that it is important to reflect the actual , distributed location of the fluctuations ( plasmons ) that give rise to vdw forces .",
    "the vdw - df2 density functional benchmarks very well against the s22 data sets @xcite .",
    "it is also the functional being more extensively compared between experiment and theory here .",
    "certain very well - pronounced features , like isotropy of the h@xmath0-cu pec , the ( 111 ) , ( 100 ) , and ( 110 ) pecs being close to identical , and the clear trend in its corrugation that grows in order ( 111 ) @xmath22 ( 100 ) @xmath22 ( 110 ) , are well described .",
    "the calculated @xmath35 results are found to be close to the experimental ones , thereby being almost decisive on exchange functionals .",
    "the energy levels for the quantum - mechanical motion in the h@xmath0-cu pec agree in a gratifying way .",
    "the vdw - df2 is found promising for applications at short and intermediate distances , as is relevant for adsorption .",
    "however , the accuracy of experimental data is high enough to stimulate a more detailed analysis of all aspects of the theoretical description .",
    "this should be valuable for the further xc - functional development .",
    "for instance , some discrepancies are found for the eigenvalues .",
    "they signal that the vdw - df2 pec for h@xmath0 on cu(111 ) might not have a perfect shape .",
    "additional physical effects could be searched for .",
    "the metallic surface state on cu(111 ) might be one source ; it is possible that the metallic nature of the h@xmath0/cu(111 ) , h@xmath0/cu(100 ) , and h@xmath0/cu(110 ) systems motivates modifications in the description of the electrodynamical response inside the nonlocal functional .",
    "for a well established conclusion , a more accurate theory is called for .",
