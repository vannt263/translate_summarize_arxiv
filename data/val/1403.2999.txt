    "more than 50 years ago , p. w. anderson described in a seminal paper @xcite how diffusion in the process of electron transport in a disordered ( _ random _ ) semiconductor lattice can be arrested , leading to the localization of the wavefunction in a small region of space , the so - called _",
    "anderson localization_. this unique phenomenon has been observed in a myriad of physical systems @xcite , including electron gas @xcite , matter waves ( atoms ) @xcite , and acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "the observation of transverse localization of light in a photonic system was predicted by de raedt et al .",
    "@xcite , considering the similarities existing between the schrdinger equation and maxwell equations .",
    "this led to the observation of anderson localization in photonic systems @xcite in various scenarios .",
    "the underlying physical principles that lead to anderson localization are also responsible for changes on the spreading of the wavefunction in a quantum random walk , characterized by a quadratic dependence of the size ( variance ) of the wavefunction with propagation distance when no disorder is present @xcite .",
    "the consequences of introducing static disorder in a quantum random walk ( leading to anderson localization ) have been studied , for example , for one - dimensional @xcite and two - dimensional @xcite systems . in a sense , generalizations of quantum protocols such as the shor s factorization algorithm @xcite and the groover s searching algorithm @xcite can also be analyzed in similar terms , since they can be viewed as quantum random walks .    in most cases , the input state in a quantum random walk",
    "is considered to be fully coherent . since",
    "anderson localization is a consequence of interference effects , one can dare thinking that an initial coherent state is thus necessary to observe anderson localization .",
    "however , apeta et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that even a partially coherent input light beam can lead to anderson localization in a disordered waveguide array ( wga ) .",
    "partially coherent beams can be described as a superposition of orthogonal coherent modes , where the modal coefficients are random variables that are uncorrelated with one another @xcite .",
    "therefore , according to @xcite , since spreading of each mode , being a coherent mode , can be arrested in a random medium with static disorder , the whole partially coherent beam should also suffer localization in a similar way to a fully coherent beam .    here",
    "we propose an experimental scheme which could lead to the observation of anderson localization of partially coherent beams with a tunable degree of first - order coherence .",
    "the approach is based on two basic ingredients . on the one hand ,",
    "a single - photon in a pure quantum state ( von neumann entropy @xmath0 ) is arguably the most simple example of a photonic state which shows first - order coherence @xcite .",
    "mixed single - photon quantum states do not show first - order coherence .",
    "on the other hand , the degree of entanglement of a pure two - photon state ( photons a and b ) is directly related to the purity of the quantum state of photon a ( b ) , which results from tracing out all degrees of freedom corresponding to photon b ( a ) . the von neumann entropy of the quantum state that describes photon a ( b ) could be used as a measure of the degree of entanglement of the paired photons .",
    "consequently , the manipulation of the degree of entanglement of the two - photon state can effectively tailor the first - order coherence of the signal ( idler ) photon @xcite , generating a one - photon quantum state which is mixed , and thus partially coherent .",
    "anderson localization ( _ co - localization _ ) of entangled photon fields in disordered waveguides has been presented in @xcite . however , in that case the goal was to look for anderson localization of the two photons that form the entangled pair , while here entanglement is a tool to tailor the degree of coherence of one of the subsystems ( photon a or photon b ) which form the entangled pair .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the experimental scheme and the main theoretical tools used in the analysis are presented and discussed .",
    "main results are presented in section iii .",
    "the single - photon coherence measures used throughout the text are defined in the appendix .",
    "in general , the quantum description of a pure entangled two - photon state ( photons a and b ) is written @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent the transverse wavevectors of photons @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are creation operators of photons in modes @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and @xmath8 is the mode function that describes the properties of the biphoton @xcite . for monochromatic fields ,",

    "<S> we put forward an experimental configuration to observe transverse anderson localization of partially coherent light beams with a tunable degree of first - order coherence . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme makes use of entangled photons propagating in disordered waveguide arrays , and is based on the unique relationship between the degree of entanglement of a pair of photons and the coherence properties of the individual photons constituting the pair . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme can be readily implemented with current waveguide - on - a - chip technology , and surprisingly , the tunability of the coherence properties of the individual photons is done at the measurement stage , without resorting to changes of the light source itself . </S>"
