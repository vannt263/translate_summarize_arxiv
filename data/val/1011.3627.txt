    "although a homogeneous neutron matter is one of the simplest nuclear systems , its importance can not be overemphasized since it constitutes the main component of neutron stars .",
    "the density of the neutron matter forming neutron stars ranges from subnuclear densities ( in the inner crust ) up to extremely high values of @xmath4 ( expected in the center of the star ) , where @xmath5 is the saturation density@xcite .    in the regime of sufficiently low densities",
    "one can perform very precise calculations since the neutron - neutron interaction is completely dominated by the scattering in @xmath6 channel , which is determined by two parameters only : the scattering length @xmath7 and the effective range @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , at the densities @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) the influence of other channels as well as of three - body forces is marginal and can be neglected@xcite .",
    "the values of the scattering length and the effective range are well known from the low energy scattering experiments and read : @xmath11 , @xmath12@xcite . at the densities where @xmath13 the dilute neutron matter is an example of a strongly correlated system . moreover ,",
    "the influence of the effective range can not be ignored except for very low densities where @xmath14@xcite .",
    "it implies that only non - perturbative approaches are able to gain a reliable insight into physics of this system . the large class of such methods , which are known under the general name of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) , has been applied for the dilute neutron matter@xcite . in spite of a considerable theoretical effort some of its static properties",
    "are still vaguely known .",
    "the open questions mostly concern the superfluid state , which is generated at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "for example the predicted value of the zero temperature energy gap differs significantly for various approaches , revealing a strong dependence on the details of the applied method ( see@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the same concerns the critical temperature of the superfluid - normal phase transition , where the well known bcs formula @xmath15 is believed to be valid .    here",
    "we present the selected results concerning the superfluid state , obtained within the afqmc approach at non - zero temperatures@xcite for the dilute neutron matter of density @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this study can be regarded as a continuation of the investigations presented in the papers @xcite , where the details of the afqmc algorithm and the procedure of adjusting the interaction , have been discussed . in the present study we focused on two basic quantities which characterize a superfluid state : the critical temperature and the pairing gap .",
    "in the case of superfluidity the convenient order parameter is specified by the long - distance behavior of the two - body density matrix @xmath18 where the field operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 obey the fermionic anticommutation relations .",
    "such a long - distance behavior is directly related to the condensate fraction @xmath21 , which measure the fraction of cooper pairs forming a condensate@xcite .",
    "this quantity can be efficiently computed within afqmc , provided the information concerning the one - body density matrix @xmath22 is also included .",
    "the condensate fraction is given by:@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for the number of particles and the correlation functions @xmath25 are defined as : @xmath26     as a function of temperature ( in units of fermi energy @xmath27 ) for three lattice sizes @xmath28 .",
    "the inset presents the rescaled condensate fraction obtained for lattices @xmath29 ( squares ) and @xmath30 ( circles ) .",
    "the intersection of the fitted lines determines the critical temperature of the superfluid - normal phase transition , @xmath31 . ]",
    "the figure [ fig : nm_alpha ] presents the condensate fraction versus the temperature for three different lattice sizes @xmath28 .",
    "it is clearly visible that the results for @xmath32 significantly deviate from those obtained for larger lattices .",
    "it is due to the fact that for small lattices the limiting value of @xmath33 is rather poorly determined . indeed , ",
    "the infinity  in this case is equal to the half of the box size and is only a few times larger than the interaction range .",
    "consequently , it will generate a large systematic error when the lattice is too small .",
    "the presented results indicate that this is exactly the case for @xmath32 and therefore these data were not included in the process of determination of the critical temperature .    in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the condensate fraction has to vanish at the critical temperature @xmath2 .",
    "however , in the case of calculations in the box the finite size effects come into play and smooth out all singularities typical for the phase transition .",
    "still , one can estimate the critical temperature using the method based on the finite size scaling .",
    "similar technique has been used to determine the critical temperature for cold atomic gases ( see@xcite for details ) .",
    "the volume - dependent estimation of the critical temperature @xmath34 is obtained by finding the intersection of the rescaled condensate fraction @xmath35 for two different lattice sizes @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the universal critical exponent and @xmath38 is the volume of the box . as @xmath39",
    "the thermodynamic limit is recovered and the series @xmath34 converges to the critical temperature . to extract @xmath2",
    "we have used two largest of the available lattices , namely @xmath40 .",
    "the filling factor in both cases reads : @xmath41 . according to our experience ,",
    "the above methodology is sufficient to estimate the critical temperature with an uncertainty smaller than @xmath42 ( in fact this procedure applied to the unitary gas provides the value of @xmath2 with the relative error smaller than @xmath43 ) .",
    "finally , the estimated value of the critical temperature reads @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , where @xmath27 is the fermi energy ( see the inset of fig . [",
    "fig : nm_alpha ] ) .",
    "in order to determine the gap in the single particle spectrum , we have computed the spectral weight function @xmath46 . this quantity has been extracted from the imaginary time propagator @xmath47 through the analytic continuation@xcite .",
    "the procedure is equivalent to solving the integral equation : @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the inverse of the temperature and @xmath50 is determined from the monte carlo calculations for the discrete set of values @xmath51 .",
    "numerically , however , the above integral equation represents an ill - posed problem i.e. there is an infinite class of solutions for @xmath46 which satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ap ] ) within uncertainties generated by monte carlo method .",
    "therefore we have used two methods which were in particular designed to deal with such tasks : the truncated svd method and the maximum entropy method@xcite .",
    "for the dilute neutron matter at selected temperatures : a )  @xmath52 , b )  @xmath53 , c )  @xmath54 , d )  @xmath55 .",
    "the nonzero energy gap is present up to the critical temperature @xmath31 . ]",
    "the spectral functions for selected temperatures ( below and above @xmath2 ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : nm_spectral ] .",
    "our results admit the gapped solutions up to the critical temperature and above @xmath2 the gap vanishes .",
    "one has to remember , however , that there is a finite resolution of both methods concerning the value of the gap .",
    "namely , the gap can not be resolved if its value decreases below @xmath56 .",
    "the value of the energy gap @xmath57 extracted from the spectral function at the temperature @xmath58 is expected to provide a good approximation of its value at zero temperature .",
    "it reads : @xmath59 .    .",

    "et al.,_@xcite and predict larger paring gap . however , it is difficult to establish the source of this discrepancy since their method ( auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo ) has been constrained in order to avoid the fermionic sign problem and therefore can be regarded as a variational approach",
    ".    an interesting result can be noticed by considering the ratio of the energy gap at zero temperature to the critical temperature .",
    "namely , the ratio @xmath60 exceeds almost twice the well - known bcs value @xmath61 .",
    "a similar situation has been encountered for the unitary gas , where the existence of the exotic `` pseudogap '' phase above @xmath2 was recently reported@xcite .",

    "we focused on the basic quantities which characterize the superfluid state and extracted the value of the critical temperature and the pairing gap .",
    "our results are free from uncontrolled approximations and are essentially exact with only uncertainties related to statistical errors and finite size effects .",
