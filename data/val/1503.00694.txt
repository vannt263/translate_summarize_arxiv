    "many important properties in the theory of social choice concern the consistency of aggregation functions under varying parameters . what happens if two electorates are merged ?",
    "how should an aggregation function deal with components of similar alternatives",
    "? how should choices from overlapping agendas be related to each other ?",
    "these considerations have led to a number of consistency axioms that these functions should ideally satisfy .",
    "unfortunately , social choice theory is rife with impossibility results which have revealed the incompatibility of many of these properties .",
    "@xcite , for example , have pointed out that every social choice function that satisfies condorcet - consistency violates consistency with respect to variable electorates . on the other hand",
    ", it follows from results by @xcite and @xcite that all pareto - optimal social choice functions that are consistent with respect to variable electorates are inconsistent with respect to components of similar alternatives .",
    "the main result of this paper is that , in the context of _ probabilistic _ social choice , consistency with respect to variable electorates and consistency with respect to components of similar alternatives uniquely characterize an appealing probabilistic social choice function , which furthermore satisfies condorcet - consistency .",
    "probabilistic social choice functions yield lotteries over alternatives ( rather than sets of alternatives ) and were first formally studied by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "perhaps one of the best known results in this context is @xcite s characterization of strategyproof probabilistic social choice functions @xcite .",
    "an important corollary of gibbard s characterization , attributed to hugo sonnenschein , is that _",
    "random dictatorships _ are the only strategyproof and _ ex post _ efficient probabilistic social choice functions . in random dictatorships ,",
    "one of the voters is picked at random and his most preferred alternative is implemented as the social choice . while gibbard s theorem might seem as an extension of classic negative results on strategyproof non - probabilistic social choice functions @xcite , it is in fact much more positive ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast to deterministic dictatorships , the uniform random dictatorship ( henceforth , random dictatorship ) , in which every voter is picked with the same probability , enjoys a high degree of fairness and is in fact used in many subdomains of social choice that are concerned with the fair assignment of objects to agents ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      in this paper",
    ", we consider two consistency axioms , non - probabilistic versions of which have been widely studied in the literature .",
    "the first one , _ population - consistency _ , requires that , whenever two disjoint electorates agree on a lottery , this lottery should also be chosen by the union of both electorates .",
    "the second axiom , _ composition - consistency _ , requires that the probability that an alternative receives is unaffected by introducing new variants of another alternative .",
    "alternatives are variants of each other if they form a component , they bear the same relationship to all other alternatives . on top of that , composition - consistency prescribes that the probability of an alternative within a component should be directly proportional to the probability that the alternative receives when the component is considered in isolation .",
    "apart from their intuitive appeal , these axioms can be motivated by the desire to prevent a central planner from strategically partitioning the electorate into subelectorates or by deliberately introducing similar variants of alternatives , respectively .",
    "our first result shows that there is no non - probabilistic social choice function that satisfies both axioms simultaneously .",
    "we then move to probabilistic social choice and prove that the only probabilistic social choice function satisfying these properties is the function that returns all _ maximal lotteries _ for a given preference profile .",
    "maximal lotteries , which were proposed independently by @xcite and other authors , are equivalent to mixed maximin strategies of the symmetric zero - sum game given by the pairwise majority margins .",
    "whenever there is an alternative that is preferred to any other alternative by some majority of voters ( a so - called condorcet winner ) , the lottery that assigns probability  1 to this alternative is the unique maximal lottery . in other words ,",
    "maximal lotteries satisfy _ condorcet - consistency_. at the same time , maximal lotteries satisfy population - consistency which has been identified by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others as _ the _ defining property of borda s scoring rule . as such",
    ", the characterization can be seen as one possible resolution of the historic dispute between the founding fathers of social choice theory , the chevalier de borda and the marquis de condorcet , which dates back to the 18th century .",
    "random dictatorship , the most prevalent probabilistic social choice function , satisfies population - consistency , but fails to satisfy composition - consistency .",
    "for this reason , we also consider a weaker version of composition - consistency called cloning - consistency , which is satisfied by random dictatorship , and provide an alternative characterization of maximal lotteries using population - consistency , cloning - consistency , and condorcet - consistency ( see )",
    ".      clearly , allowing lotteries as outcomes for high - stakes political elections such as those for the u.s .",
    "presidency would be highly controversial and considered by many a failure of deliberative democracy .",
    "if , on the other hand , a small group of people repeatedly votes on where to hold their next meeting , randomization would likely be more acceptable and perhaps even desirable .",
    "the use of lotteries for the selection of officials interestingly goes back to the world s first democracy in athens where it was widely regarded as a principal characteristic of democracy @xcite .",
    "it has also been early observed in the social choice literature that `` unattractive social choices may result whenever lotteries are not allowed to compete . [  ] refusal to entertain lotteries on alternatives can lead to outcomes that to many appear to be inequitable and perhaps even inefficient '' @xcite . in contemporary research ,",
    "probabilistic social choice has gained increasing interest in both social choice ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and political science ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "whether lotteries are socially acceptable depends on many factors , only some of which are based on formal arguments . in our view , two important factors are _",
    "( i ) the effective degree of randomness _ and _ ( ii ) risk aversion on behalf of the voters_.    as to _ ( i ) _ , it is easily seen that certain cases call for randomization or other means of tie - breaking .",
    "for example , if there are two alternatives , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and exactly half of the voters prefer @xmath0 while the other half prefers @xmath1 , there is no deterministic way of selecting a single alternative without violating basic fairness conditions .",
    "there are several possibilities to extend the notion of a tied outcome to three or more alternatives .",
    "an important question in this context is whether ties are a rare exception or a common phenomenon",
    ". a particularly rigorous and influential extension due to condorcet declares a tie in the absence of a pairwise majority winner . according to condorcet",
    ", it is the intransitivity of social preferences , as exhibited in the condorcet paradox , that leads to situations in which there is no unequivocal winner . as it turns out , maximal lotteries are degenerate if and only if there is a condorcet winner .",
    "our main result thus establishes that the degree of randomness entailed by our axioms is precisely in line with condorcet s view of equivocality .",
    "interestingly , there is strong empirical and experimental evidence that most real - world preference profiles for _ political _ elections do admit a condorcet winner ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "maximal lotteries only randomize in the less likely case of cyclical majorities . @xcite",
    "specifically analyzed the support of maximal lotteries and found that the average support size is less than four under various distributional assumptions and up to 30 alternatives .",
    "by contrast , random dictatorship randomizes over all alternatives in almost all elections .    as to _",
    "( ii ) _ , risk aversion is strongly related to the frequency of preference aggregation .",
    "if an aggregation procedure is not frequently repeated , the law of large numbers does not apply and risk - averse voters might prefer a sure outcome to a lottery whose expectation they actually prefer to the sure outcome . hence , probabilistic social choice seems particularly suitable for novel preference aggregation settings that have been made possible by technological advance .",
    "the internet , in particular , allows for much more frequent preference aggregation than traditional paper - and - pencil elections . in recurring randomized elections with a fixed set of alternatives ,",
    "voters need not resubmit their preferences for every election ; rather preferences can be stored and only changed if desired .",
    "for example , maximal lotteries could help a group of coworkers with the daily decision of where to have lunch without requiring them to submit their preferences every day .",
    "another example are automatic music broadcasting systems , such as internet radio stations or software djs , that decide which song should be played next based on the preferences of the listeners . in contrast to traditional deterministic solutions to these problems such as sequential dictatorships ,",
    "the repeated execution of lotteries is a memoryless process that guarantees _ ex ante _ fairness after any number of elections .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the lotteries returned by probabilistic social choice functions do not necessarily have to be interpreted as probability distributions .",
    "they can , for instance , also be seen as fractional allocations of divisible objects such as time shares or monetary budgets .",
    "the axioms considered in this paper are equally natural for these interpretations as they are for the probabilistic interpretation .",
    "let @xmath2 be an infinite universal set of alternatives .",
    "the set of _ agendas _ from which alternatives are to be chosen is the set of finite and non - empty subsets of  @xmath2 , denoted by  @xmath3 .",
    "the set of all linear ( complete , transitive , and antisymmetric ) _ preference relations _ over some set @xmath4 will be denoted by @xmath5 .    for some finite set @xmath6 , we denote by @xmath7 the set of all probability distributions with rational values over @xmath6 . a ( fractional ) preference profile @xmath8 for a given agenda @xmath9 is an element of @xmath10 , which can be associated with the @xmath11-dimensional ( rational ) unit simplex .",
    "we interpret @xmath12 as the fraction of voters with preference relation @xmath13 .",
    "preference profiles are depicted by tables in which each column represents a preference relation @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "the table below shows an example profile on three alternatives . @xmath16",
    "the set of all preference profiles for a fixed agenda @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 is defined as the set of all preference profiles , @xmath19 . for @xmath20 and @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath22 is the restriction of @xmath8 to alternatives in @xmath23 , for all @xmath24 ,    @xmath25    for all @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the fraction of voters who prefer @xmath28 to @xmath29 ( the set @xmath30 represents the preference relation on two alternatives with @xmath31 ) . in example  1 , @xmath32",
    ".    elements of @xmath33 are called _ lotteries _ and will be written as convex combinations of alternatives . if @xmath34 is a lottery , @xmath35 is the probability that @xmath34 assigns to alternative @xmath28 .    a _ probabilistic social choice function ( pscf ) _",
    "@xmath36 is an ( upper hemi- ) continuous function that , for any agenda @xmath37 , maps a preference profile @xmath38 to a convex subset of @xmath33 .",
    "a pscf is thus a collection of mappings from high - dimensional simplices to low - dimensional simplices .",
    "two further properties that we demand from any pscf are _ unanimity _ and _ decisiveness_. unanimity states that in the case of one voter and two alternatives , the preferred alternative should be chosen with probability  1 .",
    "since we only consider fractional preference profiles , this amounts to for all @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 in other words , for every preference profile that yields multiple lotteries , there is an arbitrarily close preference profile that only yields a single lottery .",
    "probabilistic social choice functions considered in the literature usually satisfy these conditions and are therefore well - defined pscfs . for example , consider _ random dictatorship ( @xmath42 ) _ , in which one voter is picked uniformly at random and his most - preferred alternative is returned .",
    "formally , @xmath42 returns the unique lottery , which is determined by multiplying fractions of voters with their respective top choices , for all @xmath37 and @xmath21 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the unique alternative @xmath28 such that @xmath45 for all @xmath46 .",
    "for the preference profile @xmath8 given in example  1 , @xmath47 @xmath42 is single - valued and therefore trivially decisive and convex - valued .",
    "it is also easily seen that @xmath42 satisfies unanimity and continuity and thus constitutes a pscf .",
    "a useful feature of our definition of pscfs is that traditional _ set - valued _ social choice functions ( scfs ) ( also known as _ social choice correspondences _ ) can be seen as a special case , namely as those pscfs that map every preference profile @xmath21 on some agenda @xmath37 to @xmath7 for some @xmath48 .",
