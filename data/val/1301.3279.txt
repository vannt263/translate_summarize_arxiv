    "symmetries play an important role in physics , often serving as guide - lines in studying characteristic features of motion of quantum systems . in particular , in nuclear physics , the spatial symmetries of the nuclear mean - field potential are crucial in determining both the properties of the independent particle motion and of the nuclear stability .",
    "the best known , the spherical symmetry of the potential , implies the high degeneracy of the single - particle level energies , the so - called magnetic degeneracy , @xmath0 , of the orbitals characterised by the spherical - shell angular - momentum quantum - number , @xmath1 , and leads to the well - known spherical magic numbers in nuclei .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of the spherical symmetry arises when the energies of the spherical configuration of the system with certain particle numbers are higher as compared to the energies of the alternative non - spherical spatial distribution of nucleons , the mechanism to which the pauli exclusion principle contributes importantly .",
    "the spherical symmetry breaking removes the @xmath0-degeneracy and leads to the deformed single - particle orbital scheme  @xcite .",
    "more generally , nuclei which are not spherical may acquire the forms governed by the point - group symmetries , some being more likely than the others  depending on the actual number of nucleons . in this context",
    ", it has been suggested , cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein , that each symmetry group ` sufficiently rich ' in terms of symmetry elements may lead to its proper scheme of magic numbers , which in turn can be seen as characterising such a symmetry group from the point of view of realistic realisations of the nuclear mean - field theories . in particular , a series of earlier publications related to point - group symmetries focused on the tetrahedral and octahedral symmetry groups which are the only ones that lead to an extra ( four - fold ) degeneracy of single - nucleonic levels in _ deformed _ nuclei and to an increased nuclear stability . in other words : the tetrahedral and octahedral symmetries are the only ones within which both the four - fold degeneracy ( ` unusual ' case ) appears for some levels and the two - fold degeneracy ( ` usual ' case ) appears for some other levels .",
    "this should be compared to the habitual two - fold ( kramers ) degeneracy associated with _",
    "all _ the levels known in all other deformed nuclei as e.g.  in the case of the quadrupole deformation , see e.g. , ref .",
    "in fact , the symmetry - implied large shell gaps occur at some specific nucleon numbers and they can be comparable to the spherical shell - gaps .",
    "the tetrahedral magic numbers , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , for the neutrons and protons , respectively , are  @xcite : @xmath2 or @xmath3 = 16 , 20 , 32 , 40 , 56 , 6870 , 9094 , 112 ,  and  136/142 .",
    "the possibility that tetrahedral symmetry is present in atomic nuclei has been discussed as early as in 1970ies for @xmath4o in relation to the hypothetical four alpha - cluster structure  @xcite .",
    "calculations employing the microscopic - macroscopic method  @xcite , or the skyrme hartree - fock ( hfb ) method  @xcite suggested that , in heavier nuclei , the tetrahedral shapes may appear in low - lying excited- , or even in the ground - states for specific nucleon numbers ; see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for more recent works .",
    "it is , therefore , both timely and interesting to employ the well established methods of the theory of nuclear structure in an attempt of examining the leading features of the excitation spectra of collective motion associated with of the tetrahedral shape .    in this article",
    "we focus on certain properties of nuclear rotational bands in tetrahedral - deformed nuclei using advanced microscopic techniques which employ the angular - momentum and particle - number projection methods .",
    "although the methods of performing the projections are straightforward and well - known  @xcite , their numerical realisation is a non - trivial task , especially for the non - axially symmetric and non - time - reversal invariant systems described using the cranking approximation ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "we have developed an efficient method to perform the projection from general and realistic mean - field wave functions calculated with large number of basis states  @xcite .",
    "characteristic features of our method which have an important impact on an increased efficiency in the numerical realisation of the algorithm can be summarised as follows : ( a )  an efficient truncation scheme using the information about the occupation probabilities in the canonical basis ; ( b )  the full use of the thouless amplitude with respect to a slater determinant state in place of the generalised bogoliubov amplitudes ; ( c )  avoiding the sign problem for the norm overlap in terms of the pfaffians  @xcite with using the thouless amplitude .",
    "the tetrahedral - symmetry nuclear - states have not been so far identified in nature . in order to facilitate the associated experimental research program in the case of a possible discovery of a new quantum phenomenon , one needs to establish first of all the global and leading characteristic properties of the tetrahedrally - symmetric nuclei .",
    "the main focus of the present article is to test the projection techniques associated with the mean - field methods , as far as the characteristic features of the energy spectra are concerned rather than trying to be as realistic as possible in terms of the energy scale predictions .",
    "another aspect is to test the projection techniques necessary to calculate the electromagnetic transition probabilities within the nuclear - mean field theory .",
    "such transition probabilities and/or their branching ratios can be used as characteristic signs of the symmetries and will become a necessary tool for establishing such symmetries in nature .",
    "the related research program is in progress and results will be published elsewhere .    in the next section , sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , the principal mathematical expressions of the method are briefly recapitulated ; the details can be found in ref .",
    "the results of calculation are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . the final section , sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] , is devoted to the summary and possible future perspectives .",
    "in what follows we assume that a nucleus is in a state corresponding to a tetrahedral - symmetry minimum , one possibly among other competing minima in the total energy landscape . assuming purely static configurations , i.e. , ignoring the collective effects such as the zero - point vibrations or any other form of , e.g. , large - amplitude motion which may be particularly needed in the case of the flat energy landscapes",
    ", we will calculate the excitation pattern using the angular - momentum , parity , and particle - number projection techniques , the latter in relation to pairing , combined with the mean - field techniques .",
    "thus , the most general symmetry - conserving wave function is sought in the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the angular - momentum and parity projectors ( see e.g. ref .",
    "the mean - field state @xmath8 is taken in the form of the anti - symmetrised product ( hfb type ) wave - functions , which is specified in sec .",
    "[ sec : meanf ] .",
    "the @xmath9-mixing coefficients , @xmath10 , are obtained by solving the generalised eigen - value problem of the hill - wheeler equations @xmath11 with the hamiltonian and norm kernel matrices being defined as usual as : @xmath12 in the present approach we wish to go beyond the mean - field approximation without perturbing the tetrahedral symmetry of the problem .",
    "this can be done by introducing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hnkernels ] ) a two - body spherically - symmetric hamiltonian @xmath13 , whose form will be discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : mhamil ] .",
    "the neutron and proton number projections require the number projectors ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , which are further included in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ipiproj])@xmath16([eq : hnkernels ] ) .",
    "however , we found that the effect of the number projections on the quantum spectra in the present work is small , see sec .",
    "[ sec : yb160 ] , and they are simply neglected in most cases after verifying that such a neglect is justified .",
    "it is often of interest to employ the consistency condition between the mean - field and the many - body hamiltonians like , e.g. ,  in the skyrme - hartree - fock models , since it is believed that such a consistency offers a more realistic description of the many - body systems in question . in this article",
    "we wish to focus first of all on the nuclear excitation spectra in the presence of pure tetrahedral symmetry of the mean - field . in this context",
    "it is preferable to work with the model allowing to completely control the deformation and the underlying geometrical symmetry . for this purpose ,",
    "a phenomenological deformed mean - field is more convenient .",

    ", the pure tetrahedral deformation is realised by requiring all deformation parameters @xmath20 except @xmath21 ( more precisely , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) . in this particular case ,",
    "the problem of the centre of mass does not arise since tetrahedral - symmetric uniform - distributions preserve the position of the centre of mass independently of the value of the tetrahedral deformation .",
    "the deformed ws single - particle hamiltonian , @xmath24 , is diagonalized in the spherical harmonic oscillator basis with the oscillator quantum numbers @xmath25 and @xmath26 satisfying the usual relations @xmath27 .",
    "the hfb type product state is obtained by further including the monopole pairing field with the particle number constraint : @xmath28 the pairing gap @xmath29 in the hamiltonian above is either parametrised , cf .",
    "[ sec : param ] , or self - consistently calculated by using the hfb treatment assuming the seniority interaction for neutrons and protons , @xmath30 the simple - minded usage of this pairing interaction with large model space may lead to a divergence .",

    "the chemical potential @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fcutoff ] ) is simply chosen as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the last occupied orbital in the case of no pairing .",
    "such a treatment results in preserving typically @xmath47(25-to-35 ) and @xmath16(15-to-25 ) states around the fermi level for rare earth nuclei depending somewhat on the deformation used .    in the present article",
    "we wish to account , even if in a model dependent way , for at least some microscopic mechanisms whose existence is known already .",
    "in particular we are interested in the rotational state wave functions for increasing angular momenta .",
    "it is known that an increase of the angular momentum causes an increasing effect of the coriolis coupling , the latter resulting in a gradual increase in the rotation - induced @xmath9-mixing .",
    "since the presence of angular momentum introduces an extra direction in space , on top of the original tetrahedral symmetry , the latter is gradually more and more perturbed .",
    "studying of tetrahedral symmetry of a microscopic many - body system under the condition of increasing spin is a matter of a compromise between the original mean - field symmetry - properties and the coriolis perturbation .",
    "as long as the coriolis effects can be considered small , one may talk about the tetrahedral symmetry in the system .",
    "in the pure mean - field context the rotational motion has been studied in the past by simulating the coriolis coupling effects with the so - called cranking term which is linear in angular momentum and which contains the lagrange multiplier @xmath48 in the case of the one - dimensional rotation .",
    "more generally , in the case of three - dimensional rotation , as in the present case , a triplet of lagrange multipliers @xmath49 is introduced .",
    "the notation can be shortened to @xmath50 , where the unit vector @xmath51 points to the direction of the total spin .",
    "one can show further that the term @xmath52 can be given an _ interpretation _ of the rotational frequency valid asymptotically for increasing spin and regular nuclear energy - vs .- spin dependence  where from the notation @xmath53 .    to take into account the tetrahedral symmetry mean - field , here through @xmath54 , the pairing correlation through the term @xmath55 , which does not impact the symmetry considerations , and a gradual effect of the coriolis mechanism through the @xmath56-mixing term , @xmath57",
    ", we finally introduce the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath58 as it turns out the third term in the above equation with a small @xmath59 , typically of the order of @xmath60 mev , is sufficient to break the time - reversal invariance and to introduce the @xmath61 @xmath9-mixing in the wave function , which is important to obtain more reliably the moment of inertia  @xcite within the hill - wheeler system of equations for the states not far from the ground - state",
    ". it has been tested , cf .",
    "fig .  7 in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the resulting spectra do not depend very much on the particular choice of values of @xmath62 , as long as the spin values involved are not too high .",
    "since in this paper we are interest in the spins of up to a dozen of @xmath63 , the particular value of this coefficient does not play any essential role and we keep the above value without modification for the present purpose .",
    "let us emphasise that the present use of the third term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cpdefh ] ) , as compared to its role in the standard cranking model , is different .",
    "whereas in the cranking - model approach in numerous articles on the high spin physics , @xmath64 plays either the role of the lagrange multiplier adjusted to each new spin value and thus , on the average , increasing with spin , or , alternatively , is currently being used as an independent cranking variable in function of which observables such as e.g.  single - nucleon routhians are plotted  here it may be seen as a coupling constant in front of a certain phenomenological interaction term .      as commented already earlier ,",
    "we wish to go beyond the mean - field approximation to be able to take into account , at least partially , certain two - body correlations which have proven to be successful in a phenomenological description of not strongly - deformed nuclei . for this purpose",
    ", we employ the model hamiltonian used in the hill - wheeler formalism , cf .",
    "( [ eq : ipiproj])@xmath16([eq : hnkernels ] ) , with an auxiliary spherically - symmetric ws potential and separable , schematic two - body interactions as the ones employed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the two - body hamiltonian of this form does not perturb the tetrahedral symmetry , whereas at the same time allows for including a richer structure of the nucleon - nucleon interactions .    more specifically ,",
    "we define @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a one - body hamiltonian composed of the kinetic energy term and the spherical ws potential ( with the coulomb interaction for protons ) .",
    "the schematic particle - hole ( @xmath67-type ) interaction , @xmath68 , is chosen to be isoscalar and is defined by @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the normal ordering and @xmath71 distinguishes neutrons and protons . furthermore , the spatial representation of the above particle - hole type operator , @xmath72 , is defined through the one - body field , @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 being the central part of the ws potential and its radius , respectively .",

    "@xcite in order to cancel out the one - body exchange contributions of the multipole interactions , @xmath86 .",
    "it turns out that the effect of these terms on the resultant projected spectra is small , so that they are neglected for simplicity .",
    "a slightly different deformed mean - field hamiltonian has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely the one derived as the hartree approximation to the interaction  ( [ eq : hamf ] ) , in the form @xmath87 , which , however , coincides with the central part of the present deformed ws potential only within the first order in the deformation parameters @xmath88 .",
    "we employ , in the present work , the general shape parameterisation based on the deformed radius in eq .",
    "( [ eq : surf ] ) with the volume - conservation condition properly taken into account .",
    "moreover , the cut - off of the pairing model space is introduced directly in the operator @xmath82 in ref .",
    "@xcite ; then one has to use the spherical single - particle energy in the cut - off function  ( [ eq : fcutoff ] ) to keep the spherical invariance of the hamiltonian .",
    "we found that it sometimes causes a problem that the results are rather sensitive to the choice of model space for the relatively small pairing model space like in the present case , @xmath89 . in the present calculation , the cut - off of the pairing model space is taken into account in the step of deformed hfb calculation in eqs .",
