    "the physics of single molecule dna unzipping experiments@xcite ( in vitro mechanical analogues of helicase - mediated unzipping during dna replication@xcite ) is fairly well understood .",
    "however , much less is known about shear denaturation of dna ( see fig.[schematic ] ) .",
    "although of less immediate biological relevance , there are interesting materials science applications such as determining the strength of dna / gold nanoparticle assemblies . in one implementation@xcite , gold nanoparticles are functionalized by attaching single - stranded thiol - capped oligonucleotides .",
    "nanoparticle aggregates form ( and the solutions change color ) when duplex dna with complementary `` sticky ends '' is added to the solution .",
    "in addition to dna detection applications associated with a shift in the plasmon absorption frequency upon aggregation@xcite , ( which depends upon particle size , concentration and interparticle distance ) recent attention has focused on thermal denaturation@xcite and the effect of disorder@xcite when single stranded linker elements are used . in this paper",
    "we adapt methods developed for dna unzipping ( generalizing a simple harmonic model of degennes@xcite ) , in an effort to understand the inherent strengths and shear denaturation pathways of the hybrid dna `` bonds '' that hold these aggregates together at low temperatures .",
    "the physics governing the failure of a double stranded dna in shear mode is rather different from that in a conventional tensile mode .",
    "consider the two geometries shown schematically in fig.[schematic](a ) and [ schematic](b ) . in the tensile mode of fig.[schematic](b ) , bases are sequentially stretched as the duplex is unzipped by forces exerted on the same end of the duplex . for shear unzipping , however , these forces act on opposite ends ( as well as on opposite duplex strands ) , and the stretching is spread out over many base pairs .",
    "the statistical mechanics of dna unzipping in the tensile mode can be simply understood by associating an energy function that depends on the number of unzipped bases @xmath0 , @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the strength of the bonds and @xmath4 the elastic response of the unzipped handles including entropy effects@xcite . near the unzipping transition @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the applied tensile force , and @xmath7 the unzipping force of the dna . as @xmath8",
    ", this analysis leads to the scaling relation @xmath9 for a homopolymer and @xmath10 for heteropolymers@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore the shear unzipping transition in the same spirit . as pointed out in ref.@xcite , an important length scale for the dna",
    "is the length @xmath11 over which strain relaxes on either end ( see fig.[schematic](a ) ) .",
    "experiments that measure rupture forces of short hybridized dna segments with one strand grafted onto a substrate at one end , and the other strand grafted to a tip of an afm at the other end show an increasing dependence of the rupture force on the overlap length of the two strands@xcite .",
    "in addition , the unzipping force for a 20 base pair long sequence is about three orders of magnitude larger than that of the rupture force of a single bond@xcite . using a simple model of harmonic springs",
    ", degennes showed that the rupture force scales linearly with the overlap length for small system sizes while it saturates for large ones@xcite .",
    "recently , these predictions have been verified experimentally by the prentiss group@xcite . in these experiments",
    "one end of a dna hybrid is grafted to a glass capillary by antigen - antibody linkages while the complimentary strand at the opposite end is attached to a magnetic bead via biotin - streptavidin linkage .",
    "the magnetic bead is then placed in a uniform magnetic field gradient to ensure that a constant shear force is applied to the dna . here , we elaborate the degennes model , and study whether the physics of shear unzipping coarse - grained over this strain relaxation length yields the same physics as conventional unzipping in context of a simple model hamiltonian .",
    "we answer this question in the affirmative . with the help of a `` semi - microscopic '' model of a poly-(at ) hybrid , we find that the strain is indeed localized over a narrow region @xmath11 on either sides of the chain . at low temperatures the chain unzips when the force exceeds a threshold value @xmath12 for short chains and @xmath13 for long ones , @xmath14 being the rupture force of a single bond , @xmath15 the system size ( measured in units of the average nucleotide ) and @xmath16 the equilibrium spacing between the bases along the backbone .",
    "this behavior is similar to that observed in homopolymer unzipping in a tensile mode , albeit with a different critical unzipping force .",
    "we find that the simplified ladder model of degennes can be obtained from a more general nonlinear hamiltonian by modeling the sugar phosphate backbone by hookean springs and expanding in the displacements of ( i ) the nearest neighbor interactions among complementary base pairs on opposite rungs of the ladder and ( ii ) the next nearest neighbor interactions on different rungs of the ladder ( a simple model of stacking interactions ) to quadratic order and projecting out the eigenmode corresponding to shear deformation .",
    "we then study shear unzipping of a heteropolymer taking cues from previous studies done in tensile mode .",
    "we characterize the failure pathway of the heteropolymer in terms of a meandering exponent that measures how different it is from that of a homopolymer where the outermost bonds on the left and right half of the chain break in alternation .",
    "finally , we consider a nonlinear vector model of a poly-(at ) hybrid .",
    "the results from this analysis are qualitatively similar to that of the simplified model proposed in ref.@xcite , although the mode of failure requires the breaking of cross - braces , which are required to stabilize the vector model .",

    "adding opposing forces @xmath21 to the two opposing strands at opposite ends ( fig.[schematic](a ) ) leads to total energy @xmath38 . upon defining @xmath17 and @xmath18 as the displacement fields on the top and bottom rungs of the ladder , the position co",

    "<S> we study theoretically the mechanical failure of a simple model of double stranded dna under an applied shear . starting from a more microscopic hamiltonian that describes a sheared dna , we arrive at a nonlinear generalization of a ladder model of shear unzipping proposed earlier by degennes@xcite . using this model and a combination of analytical and numerical methods , we study the dna `` unzipping '' transition when the shearing force exceeds a critical threshold at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore the effects of sequence heterogeneity and finite temperature and discuss possible applications to determine the strength of colloidal nanoparticle assemblies functionalized by dna . </S>"
