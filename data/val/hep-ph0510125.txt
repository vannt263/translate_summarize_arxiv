    "the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak physics is generally regarded as an effective theory with a cut - off far below the plank scale .",
    "the cut - off is pinned down at the tev scale if we require that the higgs boson mass is not significantly fine - tuned .",
    "a variety of extensions of the sm at the tev scale have been considered , including supersymmetry , technicolor , little higgs and extra dimensions .",
    "all these models predict heavy states that are beyond the current experimental direct reach ( with the tevatron as a possible exception ) . while we are eagerly anticipating the operation of the lhc to produce and observe these heavy states , they could also leave their traces in the electroweak precision tests ( ewpts ) @xcite , by means of quantum corrections . due to the remarkable agreement between the sm predictions and the experimental results",
    ", the ewpts do not tell us which direction of new physics is particularly promising .",
    "rather , they often put stringent constraints on the model we are considering .",
    "a model - independent approach to the electroweak constraints is desirable , in which one needs to calculate the constraints only once and then is able to apply them to different models .",
    "the oblique @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 parameter approach @xcite has exhibited this merit , and has been effectively used to constrain various models . however , there exist models with corrections to the sm that can not the fully described by the oblique parameters .",
    "a general method that can incorporate both the oblique and non - oblique corrections is the effective theory approach @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "all heavy particles are integrated out and their effects are manifested in the effective higher order operators suppressed by powers of the heavy mass scale . for a given order , there are only a limited number of such operators , to the contrast of the vast number of possible theoretical extensions . assuming arbitrary coefficients for the operators , one calculates the corrections to the electroweak precision observables ( ewpos ) and",
    "compares them with the experimental data .",
    "the electroweak constraints are then obtained in terms of the operator coefficients .    in a previous publication @xcite",
    ", we focused on a set of dimension-6 operators that are consistent with the sm gauge symmetry , as well as cp , lepton and baryon number conservation .",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking was assumed to be linearly realized so that one or more higgs doublets were present in the sm particle spectrum .",
    "we also assumed @xmath0 flavor symmetry , in other words , flavor universality for the operators .",
    "this is perhaps the simplest way to avoid large fcncs and is well motivated in many theoretical frameworks .",
    "we chose those operators @xmath7 that could be tightly constrained and added them to the sm lagrangian : @xmath8 where @xmath9 has mass dimension one , denoting the energy scale that suppresses the operator @xmath7 .",
    "we calculated the corrections to the ewpos linearly in @xmath10 and obtained the bounds on arbitrary linear combinations of these operators .",
    "the results have been used to constrain the mass of a generic @xmath11 gauge boson @xcite , and the parameter spaces of a variety of little higgs models @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , small fcncs can be achieved without assuming flavor universality .",
    "technically , each of the @xmath12 symmetries can be relaxed to @xmath13 with one @xmath14 corresponding to one generation , as long as each generation is a mass eigenstate . with the @xmath13 symmetry",
    ", operators involving different generations can have different coefficients , and still do not contribute to fcncs .",
    "however , from the model - building point of view , it is unnatural to assume that the effective operators only contain mass eigenstates . in fact , in many models , operators are obtained by integrating out heavy gauge bosons , and involve gauge eigenstates instead .",
    "but natural flavor - dependent models at tev scale are still possible , as long as universality is conserved for the first two generations and only the third generation is treated differently .",
    "this is mainly due to two reasons .",
    "first , the mass and gauge eigenstates of the third generation of quarks are quasi - aligned , namely , they are almost identical up to small rotations of order @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the wolfenstein parameter in the ckm matrix .",
    "this is to the contrast of the first two generations of quarks , where the mixing is of order @xmath17 .",
    "second , the most stringent experimental constraints on flavor violation come from the kaon system , which can be avoided by assuming universality for the first two generations .",
    "the flavor changing experiments involving the third generation currently have limited statistics , and do not rule out tev scale flavor physics @xcite .    given the above observation",
    ", we extend the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite on electroweak constraints to incorporate flavor - dependent operators .",
    "we relax each of the @xmath12 symmetries to @xmath18 , with the @xmath19 reflecting the universality of the first two generations .",
    "the @xmath14 corresponds to flavor conservation in the third generation .",
    "we do not attempt to analyze the bounds from flavor changing measurements , which is a rich and interesting topic in itself .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent analysis .",
    "rather , we will use the flavor - conserving ewpts to constrain arbitrary linear combinations of all relevant flavor - dependent dimension-6 operators .",
    "we will use mass eigenstates as the basis of the operators .",
    "however , due to the universality in the first two generations and the quasi - alignment in the third generation discussed in the previous paragraph , the results apply as well to gauge eigenstates , and in general , to any basis that differs by only small rotations . of course , since the symmetry is relaxed , there are more operators in this case than in the flavor - independent case .",

    "the experimental data contain all precisely measured observables relevant to our analysis , including the @xmath48 boson mass , observables from atomic parity violation , deep inelastic scattering and @xmath42-pole experiments , and fermion and @xmath48 boson pair production data from lep 2 .",
    "since the corrections are assumed to be linear in @xmath10 , the @xmath2 is quadratic : @xmath49 in the above equation , @xmath50 is the value of @xmath2 when all @xmath10 are set to zero .",

    "here we only comment on the results .    unlike the @xmath0 case ,",
    "not all of the operators can be independently constrained by the current data . there",
    "exist `` flat directions '' in which some combinations of the operators have vanishing corrections to all of the ewpos and thus can not be constrained .",
    "this is due to the increase in the number of operators and the lack of relevant measurements . to remove as many as possible flat directions",
    ", we have added a few observables that were omitted in the previous analysis .",
    "these observables were omitted because they are less precisely measured than others that could constrain the same operators , due to the large @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the added observables are mainly the total cross - sections and asymmetries in the processes @xmath53 and @xmath54 at lep 2 @xcite .",
    "they are useful for removing flat - directions for 4-fermion operators containing 2 leptons and 2 quarks . without these data ,",
    "there are 5 flat directions involving such operators .",
    "this is what one would expect : because the third generation is separated from the first two , there are five new 4-fermion operators containing heavy quarks : @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "however the only data in the previous analysis that can constrain these operators is the total hadronic cross - section for @xmath57 scattering measured at lep 2 , and the constraints from these data are still correlated with the constraints on operators containing the light quarks . after adding the @xmath53 and @xmath58 data , 4 out of the 5 flat directions are removed .",
    "the remaining flat direction comes from the fact that the operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 contribute the same to the @xmath61 process : @xmath62    less important observables added to the analysis are the asymmetries for the strange quark : @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xcite measured at the z - pole .",
    "they are much less precisely measured than the asymmetries for the bottom quark : @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which would constrain the same operators if @xmath0 were assumed .",
    "it turns out that adding these observables does not remove any of the flat - directions , but helps to refine the constraints .    besides the one in eq .",
    "( [ flat1 ] ) , there are three other flat directions : @xmath67 these flat directions reflect the lack of ewpos involving top pair production and @xmath68-nucleon , @xmath68-lepton scattering .",
    "besides the exact flat directions , there also exist `` weakly - bounded '' directions , which means that these directions can not be tightly constrained by the available data .",
    "to illustrate this point , we consider the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) . by doing so",
    ", the correlations between different directions are removed .",
    "each eigenvector represents a direction that can be independently constrained .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue is the @xmath70 constraint on the scale @xmath9 for this direction .",
    "numerically , four of the eigenvalues are zeroes , corresponding to the four flat directions discussed above . the next few smallest eigenvalues are 190 , 210 , 270 , 280 and 580 gev .",
    "bounds on @xmath9 this small can not be taken literally .",
    "this is because when calculating the corrections to ewpos , we only work to the linear order in the coefficients @xmath10 , corresponding to the linear order in @xmath71 or @xmath72 . here",
    "@xmath73 gev , is the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , and @xmath74 is the energy scale of a given measurement , which goes up to about 200 gev for the lep 2 measurements .",
    "since the smallest nonzero eigenvalues mentioned above are close to @xmath75 or @xmath74 , the second order corrections in @xmath10 are of the similar size and thus can not be neglected . to obtain precise bounds one has to include these second order corrections , as well as corrections from higher order operators beyond dimension-6 .",
    "in this case , a model - by - model approach would be more convenient .",
    "the existence of the flat and weakly - bounded directions is not a deficiency of our method .",
    "rather , it reflects the fact that not enough measurements are available to tightly constrain all independent operators . in principle , these directions could also be constrained if new or more precise measurements were available . in practice ,",
    "the chance is rare for the coefficients of the effective operators in a model to coincide with the flat or weakly - bounded directions .",
    "moreover , one can easily check if the obtained bounds are large enough to ignore the higher order corrections .",
    "usually a bound on @xmath9 about 1 tev is large enough , because higher order corrections are suppressed by extra powers of @xmath71 or @xmath72 , which are negligible for @xmath76 tev . even if we obtain bounds that are much smaller than 1 tev and thus not precise , we will still be certain that the exact bounds will not be much tighter .",
    "often , learning that a model is not tightly constrained by ewpts is interesting enough .    in the following section ,",
    "we apply our general result to obtain the bounds for two flavor - dependent models .",
    "we will first integrate out the heavy degrees of freedom and obtain the operator coefficients @xmath10 as functions of the parameters in the theory .",

    "<S> flavor universality and thus @xmath0 flavor symmetry were assumed for the operators . in this article , we expand the analysis to account for the flavor - dependent theories that distinguish the third generation of fermions from the light two generations . we still assume flavor universality for the light two generations to avoid large fcncs . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the @xmath0 flavor symmetry is relaxed to @xmath1 ^ 5 $ ] , and therefore more operators are added . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the corrections to electroweak precision observables , assuming arbitrary coefficients for the operators . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections are combined with the standard model predictions and the experimental data to obtain the @xmath2 distribution as a function of the operator coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our result to constrain two flavor - dependent extensions of the standard model : the simplest little higgs model and a model with an @xmath3 gauge group . </S>"
