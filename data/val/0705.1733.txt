    "in the case of aeroacoustics , this approximation works because the fluid velocity is always assumed to be small compared to the velocity of the radiated acoustic waves ( low mach number ) . in the cosmological regime ,",
    "the interesting case is for plasma with a relativistic amount of kinetic energy ( otherwise there is not substantial gravitational radiation produced ) .",
    "this will occur only when the plasma is at a high enough temperature that it is fully relativistic : otherwise , the amount of energy injected into plasma motions would have to be a substantial fraction of the particle mass scale rather than the cosmological temperature scale , and this is unlikely on general grounds .",
    "a relativistic plasma has sound speed @xmath142 , and the mach number of the turbulent plasma can never be much larger than 1 ; it will also not be too much smaller than 1 . in this case",

    "( [ hijijzero_2 ] ) . note that in this limit , the dependence on the mach number @xmath101 simply scales with the frequency .",

    "this result of a constant @xmath148 is universal and does not depend on either the spectrum or temporal characteristics of the turbulence ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "@xmath152 , an integration by parts gives the leading - order asymptotic behavior as @xmath153 this exponential suppression is evident in fig .",
    "1 ; the dependence on @xmath100 is negligible as expected from physical considerations .",
    "the functional form of the high - frequency suppression is determined by the specific form of the time autocorrelation function of the turbulence , eq .",
    "( [ kraichnan ] ) , but for any autocorrelation the amplitude of the emitted waves should be very small in this regime .",
    "physically , this limit corresponds to radiation frequencies which are larger than any frequencies in the turbulent motions ; consequently , no scale of turbulent fluctuations generates these radiation frequencies directly , and the resulting small radiation amplitude is due to the sum of small contributions from many lower - frequency source modes . since the integral is dominated by the lower integration limit , the highest - frequency source fluctuations ( which contain very little of the total turbulent energy ) contribute most to this high - frequency radiation tail .    in the intermediate frequency regime , for frequencies @xmath154 , the integral in eq.([hijijzero_2 ] ) is dominated by the contribution around @xmath155 due to the exponential factor in the integrand , with a width of the same order .",
    "physically , this implies that radiation emission at some frequency in this range is dominated by the turbulent vortices of the same frequency .",
    "consequently , we have the rough estimate @xmath156 this yields @xmath157 , compared to @xmath158 in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath159 is the turbulence circulation frequency at the stirring scale .",
    "the slight discrepancy from the spectrum shape in ref .",
    "@xcite comes about because we have treated the time correlations of the turbulence in a more realistic way . here",
    "we distinguish two time scales , the decorrelation time which describes how the fluid velocities in a given size eddy are correlated with each other after a given time interval , and the largest eddy turnover time . in practice ,",
    "the dropoff with frequency in this regime is strong enough that the high - frequency behavior in eq .",

    ", this modified turbulence spectrum produces radiation with very similar detectability properties to that from the kolmogoroff turbulence spectrum considered here .",
    "we have calculated for the first time the spectrum of relic gravitational radiation resulting from a period of stationary turbulence in the early universe , in terms of the turbulence duration , stirring scale , reynolds and mach numbers , and the temperature of the universe when the turbulence occurs .",
    "this is probably the best that can be done without a detailed simulation of actual turbulent motions .",
    "the most likely source of energy injection leading to turbulence is an early - universe phase transition ; the connection between the phenomenological parameters describing a phase transition and the parameters describing the turbulence are given explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the calculation we present here is conceptually simple .",
    "the only assumptions made are that the turbulence lasts for a finite duration which is at least a turnover time on the stirring scale , and that during this time the turbulence can be characterized as stationary .",

    "( [ kraichnan ] ) .",
    "these scalings are appropriate for non - relativistic turbulence with large reynolds number .",
    "while the cosmological case will have large reynolds numbers , the turbulence will be relativistic in the most interesting cases for gravitational radiation generation . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , a non - relativistic approximation to relativistic turbulence likely underestimates the resulting radiation : relativistic turbulence contains more kinetic energy for a given fluid velocity .",
    "we expect the same general results to hold , except the expression for the mach number @xmath167 will clearly be modified , giving smaller mach numbers than this non - relativistic expression .    cosmological turbulence will never be precisely stationary , since the universe is expanding .",
    "turbulence from a phase transition will also not be stationary because the duration of the source is comparable to the eddy turnover time on the stirring scale @xcite , so the turbulence will decay with time .",
    "even so , as long as the eddies on a given length scale can be treated as uncorrelated sources of turbulence , ref .",
    "@xcite argues that the resulting radiation spectrum will be close to that from a stationary source , simply due to the inevitable cascade of energy from the stirring scale down to the diffusion scale .",
    "this point can be made somewhat more formally , using an argument similar to that given by proudman @xcite . in the case of stationary turbulence , the time derivatives in eq .",
    "( [ eq:06 ] ) lead to factors of @xmath168 when computing the radiation spectrum . if the turbulence is decaying , then additional terms proportional to time derivatives of the correlation functions also will appear .",
    "but the characteristic time scale of the turbulence decay @xmath169 is at least several times greater than the turnover time on the stirring scale , and consequently , these additional terms which are proportional to @xmath170 can be neglected compared to the stationary term .",
    "it has been claimed that turbulence in the early universe is a source of such short duration that it can not be treated as stationary at all , and that the resulting radiation spectrum should be imprinted with the characteristic wave number of the turbulent source instead of its characteristic frequency @xcite .",
    "we fully agree that a gravitational wave source lasting for a sufficiently short duration will not be well described by a short piece of a stationary source ; clearly in the limit that the turbulence duration @xmath171 goes to zero , the resulting radiation spectrum should peak at a frequency corresponding to the characteristic wavenumber of the source ( the inverse stirring scale ) , and our formalism will not be valid in that limit .",
    "however , it is straightforward to see that a turbulent source in the early universe will actually last long enough so that our calculations are valid .",
    "@xcite uses a simple toy model for a stochastic cosmological gravity wave source to argue that the condition @xmath172 represents the dividing line between sources that imprint their characteristic frequency on the radiation and could be described using our formalism , and sources that imprint their wavenumber ; here we write the duration of the source as @xmath16 and the characteristic source angular frequency as @xmath173 .",
    "if we write the turbulence turnover time on the stirring scale as @xmath18 , the associated angular frequency is @xmath174 ; also write the duration of the turbulent source as @xmath175 , so that it lasts @xmath176 times the stirring - scale turnover time .",

    "@xcite confirms that , even for @xmath176 as small as 1 , the radiation spectrum will be peaked at @xmath173 .",
    "we also assume that turbulence is non - magnetic and non - helical .",
    "either of these complications can modify the power law in eq .",
    "( [ kol ] ) or the form of the time correlation eq .",
    "( [ kraichnan ] ) @xcite .",
    "the main effect of any modification is to change the rate at which the radiation spectrum falls off at high frequencies , but since this dependence is quite steep , even substantial changes to the asymptotic behavior of the spectrum lead to little qualitative difference in the spectrum . as mentioned above , the low - frequency behavior is independent of any details of the turbulence , and the peak frequency is determined by the eddy turnover time on the stirring scale where the energy density peaks , which will also be independent of any details of the turbulent cascade .",

    "however , the peak frequency also shifts to @xmath185 hz , at which point lisa s sensitivity has declined greatly ; the steep high - frequency tail of the gravitational wave spectrum makes detection with lisa marginal in this case .",
    "detectors consisting of two or more correlated lisa detectors or enhanced versions of lisa optimized for detecting stochastic backgrounds have been discussed @xcite , such as the envisioned great mission @xcite ; future space - based interferometers could be configured to give strain sensitivities comparable to lisa , but with a frequency window between @xmath185 and @xmath186 hz .",
    "such an experiment would easily detect turbulence at the electroweak scale with a mach number @xmath127 , and would even flirt with a detection at @xmath131 .",
    "turbulence generated at somewhat higher energy scales shifts to higher frequencies and easier detection with lisa .",
    "as is widely appreciated , detecting cosmological backgrounds of gravitational radiation is not only an issue of detector sensitivity , but also of foreground discrimination .",
    "the galactic population of short - period binaries of compact objects , mostly white dwarfs , is known to produce a confusion - limited stochastic background at frequencies below @xmath182 hz @xcite . at low frequencies , separating this galactic source from a cosmological source is essential , likely by exploiting the non - uniform directional distribution of an galactic source @xcite .",
