    "this new era needs a computationally intensive processing of massive time - series data with computational algorithms to recover interesting objects with a broad range of variability types @xcite .    investigating time variability of astronomical objects begins with detecting any significant changes in brightness .",
    "detection methods can be optimized to specific variability types .",
    "for example , image subtraction method is commonly used to detect supernovae , microlensing , and other variable sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . instead of detecting variability in images , recognizing variability in light curves",
    "can also be tailored to a particular type of variability signal such as transit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we presented a new framework of detecting general variability types in massive time - series data by using a non - parametric infinite gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) in our previous paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , paper i ) . in our approach ,",
    "variable objects are considered as outliers from non - variable objects which should constitute a dominant fraction of given data , in multi - dimensional space spanned by several variability indices . in the results from the infinite gmm where each group is described by a multivariate gaussian distribution @xcite",
    ", we recognize large groups as groups of non - variable objects , tagging outliers from these large groups as possible candidates of variable objects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for other methods of clustering ) .",
    "the strength of our approach is based on the assumption that non - variable objects , which do not have enough signals of variable phenomena in their light curves , represent the dominant fraction of data and share the same systematic effects hidden in the given data such as sampling patterns and noise properties . therefore , by extracting common properties of dominant non - variable objects from the given data , our approach can be less biased than choosing specific types of variability with assumptions of systematic patterns .    in this paper , the second of a series of papers , we apply our methodology to all data from the northern sky variability survey ( nsvs ; *",
    "the nsvs catalog includes about 14 million objects with the optical magnitude ranging from 8 to 15.5 and declinations higher than @xmath0 deg .",
    "these objects are so bright that deeper imaging surveys such as pan - starrs @xcite and large synoptic survey telescope @xcite can not produce useful photometric data due to saturation in their normal observation modes",
    ". therefore , variability analysis of the current nsvs data will be still useful for investigation of bright stars even after deeper images are acquired in the future surveys .",
    "moreover , the nsvs data have not been fully exploited because several previous trials have been focused on particular types of variable objects with specific criteria for variability signals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "most nsvs objects are already included in other previous surveys . in particular",
    ", the nsvs catalog can cover most of the optical magnitude range of objects detected in _",
    "@xcite , two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observations .",
    "since colors can be used to identify the particular types of spectral energy distributions , associating variability analysis to colors can be an effective way to discover new variable sources at a specific phase of stellar evolution such as mira - type variables ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or extragalactic variable objects such as quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "associating the nsvs objects with other optical surveys is also critically important .",
    "since the nsvs data do not have a high angular resolution with small telescopes , a large fraction of objects might be affected by blending , poor positioning , and incorrect identification of extended objects as stars in the nsvs data .",
    "our new variability analysis of the whole nsvs data will help others find specific variable sources by combining their data and these other multi - wavelength surveys .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : gmm ] , we explain the application of the infinite gmm to the nsvs data . in section [ sec :",
    "sep ] , we describe how to extract variable candidates by using the results from the gmm . in section [ sec : web ] , we explain the web database of our variability analysis .",
    "properties of variable candidates are explained in section [ sec : var ] , considering their associations to archival data .",
    "finally , summary and discussions are given in the last section .",
    "we extract 16,189,040 light curves from the nsvs data @xcite by limiting samples that have more than 15 good photometric data points .",
    "the good photometric points are defined as not having bad photometry flags : saturated , nocorr , lonpts , hiscat , hicorr , hisigcorr , and radecflip ( see * ? ? ? * for meanings of the flags ) . since one object",
    "can be included as several light curves in different observation fields in the nsvs catalog , the number of objects is slightly smaller than that of the light curves in our sample . here , we consider each light curve as a separate entity . among 644 observation fields of the nsvs data , six fields ( 123c , 145c , 146c , 147c , 156c , 156d )",
    "do not have any light curves having more than 15 good photometric data points .",
    "in addition to six variability indices used in paper i , we also derive skewness and kurtosis from each light curve .",
    "the definitions of these indices are summarized in table [ tab : var ] .",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are not sensitive to structure of light curves . however , estimating them is computationally cheap , describing simple low - order patterns of light curves easily .",
    "we note that our definitions of skewness and kurtosis is not the same as the traditional measures ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) .",
    "other five indices describe more complex patterns in light curves .",
    "@xmath4 represents how many sets of three consecutive data points are at least 2 @xmath5 fainter or brighter than the median magnitude , tracing continuous variations in light curves @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 measures the ratio of the mean square successive difference to the sample variance @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 have been commonly used for multi - band light curves although these can be estimated for single - band light curves @xcite . here",
    ", we use only single - band light curves with a slightly modified definition which uses sequential pairs of data points .",
    "finally , we also use the analysis of variance ( anova ) statistic which is useful for identifying periodic signals @xcite .",
    "the maximum value of the anova ( aovm ) is used to measure the strength of periodicity .",
    "even with an incorrect period of the light curve , aovm can be a valuable quantity that infers periodicity @xcite .",
    "we follow the same procedure of the infinite gmm as in our paper i. the gmm is derived for each nsvs observation field with the eight variability indices . even though the gmm converges much earlier than 100 iterations , we conduct 100 iterations as shown in paper i. since finding large groups is our main concern to find out non - variable objects from the samples , the number of iterations is not an important factor which affects how",
    "many small groups can be recovered .",
    "each gmm component is described by a multivariate gaussian distribution with its mean , i.e. center , and covariance matrix : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an index of a mixture component , @xmath11 is a vector of parameters , and @xmath12 is the number of parameters ( in our case @xmath13 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath14 is a vector of mean values ( i.e. , mixture centers ) , and @xmath15 is the covariance matrix of the gaussian distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : gmm ] shows how many groups are recovered with the infinite gmm and how many light curves are included in large groups .",
    "since a small number of observation epochs provide poor sampling of light curves and have a low probability of detecting variability , fields having few observation epochs ( i.e. , few observed frames ) are expected to have a small number of groups , while large groups dominate the whole population of light curves . in fields with a large number of light curves ,",
    "the infinite gmm recovers many groups because these fields are likely to include various kinds of variable light curves .",
    "but the fraction of data included in the large groups does not change simply as a function of the number of light curves because the total number of light curves in the field does not affect the probability that a single light curve represents a non - variable object .",
    "we measure the davies  bouldin ( db ) index in each field to check systematic differences of the gmm results .",
    "the db index is commonly used to measure the compactness of clusters and separations among them @xcite .",
    "the index is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of clusters , @xmath18 is the average distance of data points included in the cluster @xmath19 with respect to its center , and @xmath20 is the distance between centers of two clusters @xmath19 and @xmath21 .",
    "distance is defined as the @xmath22 norm which is one of the simple measurements ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion ) . as",
    "each cluster is compact and well separated from others , this db index decreases .",
    "strong systematic differences of the db index do not appear among the 638 nsvs fields as shown in figure [ fig : db ] .",
    "in most fields , the groups in the gmm results have a db index smaller than 10 .",
    "we do not find any strong systematic dependence of the db index on the number of frames and the number of light curves in each field .",
    "the highest db index @xmath23 29 is found in the field 100c which has a small number of frames and light curves . moreover , in that field the number fraction of the top three groups is highest among the sample fields .",
    "center coordinates of the largest cluster show a significant variation for different fields .",
    "since each nsvs field has different characteristics , it is not surprising to see this variation shown in figure [ fig : center ] .",
    "importantly , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are not close to zero in contrast to the expectation from assuming a normal distribution for light curves .",
    "these non - zero @xmath2 and @xmath3 imply that a dominant fraction of light curves are not well described by a normal distribution due to sampling or systematic observational effects .",
    "the same implication is also found by @xmath6 which has an expected average @xmath23 2 for a normal distribution @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : center ] proves the importance of including several variability indices which catch different features of light curves with different sensitivities as we showed in paper i.    we also examine covariance matrices of the largest cluster in each field . comparing the absolute values of the covariance matrix elements , the variances of @xmath7 or aovm have maximum values in the largest cluster of all 638 fields . in 604 fields , the variances of @xmath7 range from about 20 to 800 .",
    "but the variances of aovm in the rest of the fields range from about 20 to 400 . the largest clusters in the rest 34 fields also have a higher central value of aovm than other fields generally .",
    "in the covariance matrix of the largest cluster , the covariance between @xmath6 and @xmath7 has the smallest negative value from about @xmath24 to 0",
    ". only minor fraction of fields show the smallest negative covariance between @xmath6 and aovm .",
    "as shown in paper i , a substantial number of light curves exhibit negative correlations between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , or between @xmath6 and aovm in the nsvs data , implying systematic properties of the nsvs data .",
    "one disadvantage of clustering algorithms is that there is no useful validation process for clustering results as in other unsupervised learning methods .",
    "our approach using the infinite gmm also shares this problem with other clustering methods .",
    "therefore , there is no one absolutely right way to define a boundary between variable and non - variable objects in multi - dimensional space with the clustering results . in many situations , the selection rule of variable objects",
    "can be limited by practical issues such as the number of objects which can be investigated further in follow - up studies . here ,",
    "we suggest three possible ways to separate variable objects from non - variable objects by using clustering results .",
    "as suggested in paper i , first , we can select as variable candidate objects which are not included in large groups .",
    "figure [ fig : gmm ] shows that the largest group in each field includes a different number of objects .",
    "therefore , defining objects in the largest group as non - variable objects produce different numbers of variable candidates in each field .",
    "moreover , if there were any systematic patterns in light curves , or if the majority of non - variable light curves is not well described by a multivariate gaussian distribution , data in each field would make the second or third large groups include non - variable objects or objects affected by the systematic patterns in their light curves .",
    "basically , the existence of small clusters , i.e. , the exact number of clusters , is not an important factor to select variable candidates .",
    "figure [ fig : large_groups ] presents the change of cumulative fractions of data included in groups as the number of large groups increases .",
    "since we find only six clusters in the field 147d , the fraction of data included in the top four groups is about 99% .",
    "however , the median fraction of data included in the top four large groups is about 89% . to select variable candidates from minor groups in each field ,",
    "one could adopt a 90% cut of the cumulative fraction and avoid light curves included in large groups .",
    "another possible approach is using distances of objects from the center of the largest group in the eight - dimensional space spanned by the variability indices . in paper",
    "i , we introduced the mahalanobis distance from the largest cluster : @xmath25 where the center @xmath26 and covariance matrix @xmath27 of the largest cluster are used with the position of an individual object @xmath28 in the eight - dimensional space . unlike a commonly used euclidean distance",
    ", @xmath29 depends on @xmath27 which describes how broadly the objects in the largest cluster disperse @xcite .",
    "objects with large distances can be considered as variable objects because they have strong dissimilarity from the dominant fraction of light curves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : d_m ] , the distribution of @xmath29 for all objects with respect to the largest cluster in each field shows a peak of the distribution around @xmath30 corresponding to the mode value of the beta distribution which is expected for the distribution of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "it also shows another concentration of objects between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , implying the possible signature of a large number of variable candidates or any systematic patterns hidden in the nsvs light curves .",
    "this feature varies strongly in each field as shown for the fields 088d and 147d in figure [ fig : d_m ] .",
    "we can derive the cut of @xmath29 that includes a specific fraction of members in the largest cluster by integrating the multivariate gaussian distribution with the largest cluster s center @xmath26 and covariance matrix @xmath27 .",
    "for example , the @xmath33% cut of @xmath29 can be found with @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a multivariate gaussian distribution .",
    "practically , the integration can be estimated by using the monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "each field has a different value of @xmath36 for the same probability cut .",
    "for example , the 99% cut in the field 088d is @xmath37 , while @xmath38 corresponds to the 99% cut in the field 147d .",
    "since the largest cluster has the sharper concentration of @xmath29 in the field 147d than in the field 088d ( see figure [ fig : d_m ] ) , @xmath36 in the field 147d is smaller than that in the field 088d .",
    "these two approaches have their own different problems . avoiding",
    "large groups does not guarantee that minor groups are well separated from the largest group . in a multi - dimensional space",
    ", a few minor groups can be close to the large groups with a small @xmath29 .",
    "when selecting objects with @xmath39 as variable candidates , those objects with a large @xmath29 can form large groups representing systematic observational features in each field .",
    "although figure [ fig : d_m ] implies that members of most large groups have a small @xmath29 , using only one method can cause more contamination of non - variable objects or objects dominated by systematic patterns in each observation field .",
    "we can define variable candidates conservatively by combining both methods .",
    "for example , we find objects having the larger @xmath29 than the @xmath36 of the 99% cut and not being included in the top four large groups .",
    "figure [ fig : both ] represents the number fraction of objects selected by this conservative method compared to results of selecting objects with the @xmath36 of the 99% cut .",
    "we use this conservative selection of variable candidates in section [ sec : var ] . because the top four large groups are closely located in the eight - dimensional space generally , excluding the members of the top four large groups from the variable candidates",
    "usually determines the size of variable candidates .",
    "we provide the results of our variability analysis and clustering for all sample light curves online .",
    "the database stores the eight variability indices , the cluster identification number in each field , @xmath29 from the largest cluster for every light curve as well as the basic information of the light curves such as the nsvs object i d and coordinates .",
    "the database is supplemented with the number of light curves analyzed , the number of groups found by clustering , the number fractions of group members , and the @xmath29 cuts of 99% , 95% , and 90% cuts from the largest group in each field .",
    "therefore , users of the database can select variable candidates by using these clustering results with their own selection rules of variable candidates .",
    "the database is also supplemented by association to other astronomical catalogs .",
    "all objects analyzed are cross - matched to the simbad database , 2mass all - sky catalogs of point sources @xcite , the photometric catalog of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 @xcite , and the photometric catalog of the _ galex _ gr4/gr5 data release @xcite with the nsvs coordinates and a search radius of 6@xmath40 .",
    "when multiple objects are matched within the search radius , the nearest match is associated with the nsvs object .",
    "in addition to these catalogs , we also present matching results of the nsvs coordinates to _ iras _ @xcite and akari @xcite catalogs as separate files online .",
    "this association to other catalogs can be used to identify the morphology of the nsvs objects as galaxies or stars , to find astronomical types of known objects , to check blending effects with neighbor objects , and to estimate colors of objects as we show in the following section . in particular , because the spatial resolution of the nsvs data is much worse than the sdss and 2mass catalogs , the morphological information from these catalogs can help database users to avoid blended objects and less precise photometry in the nsvs catalog .",
    "the database can be accessed through the web interface .",
    "searching the light curves and their variability analysis is possible with equatorial coordinates and a search radius given by users . in particular , the simple cone search interface is also provided for compatibility with the virtual observatory environment @xcite .",
    "we plan to provide the basic components of the database in vizier too .",
    "in this section , we examine properties of variable candidates which are not included in the top four groups and have @xmath29 larger than the 99% cut . with these conservative selection criteria ,",
    "we find 1,840,310 light curves as possible variable candidates .",
    "we emphasize that this selection of variable candidates is highly conservative .",
    "when we select variable candidates simply with @xmath29 larger than the 95% or 99% cut , the total number of variable candidates is 6,640,387 or 5,826,587 , which is about 3.6 or 3.1 times more than the number of variable candidates selected with the conservative definition , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , when we select objects not included in the top four groups as variable candidates , the number of candidates is 1,918,580 , which is similar to the result of the conservative selection .",
    "but we remind that this selection of variable candidates is still affected by the intrinsic limits of the nsvs data such as blending effects and completely different uncertainty properties of photometry for extended objects compared to stellar objects .",
    "we search all nsvs samples with the simbad database to recognize any known objects and their basic properties such as well - known names . as explained in section 4 , the nearest simbad object around the coordinates of the nsvs objects",
    "is retrieved with a search radius of 6@xmath40 . since the nsvs data do not have information about morphological classification such as galaxy and star ,",
    "the auxiliary information of the simbad database is useful to sort out spurious variability of extended objects . about 6% of the nsvs objects",
    "are matched with at least one simbad object .",
    "but this fraction is affected by the precision of the nsvs coordinates .",
    "based on the object classification given in the simbad database , we find that 16,061 nsvs light curves correspond to known or suspected variable stars . considering only variable candidates with our conservative selection criteria , the number of known or suspected variable stars",
    "is 11,080 among our variable candidates . finally , excluding known or suspected variable stars as well as known galaxies in the simbad database , the number of new variable candidates is 1,824,123 , with our conservative selection .",
    "hereafter , our investigation of variable candidates is limited to these 1,824,123 nsvs objects .",
    "we note that uncertain coordinates in either nsvs or the simbad databases can cause us to miss some known galaxies and known or suspected variables .",
    "the classifications in the simbad databases might not be as complete as other catalogs of variable stars such as the aavso international variable star index ( vsx ) @xcite as we discuss in appendix .",
    "figure [ fig : missing_exam ] shows light curves of six example nsvs objects which are not included in our conservative selection of variable candidates , but which are known or suspected variables in the simbad database .",
    "these examples are among 11 objects , which are not included in our candidates , in the nsvs field 112a corresponding to a part of the constellation aquila .",
    "if we selected variable candidates as objects with @xmath29 larger than the 95% cut , four objects , including @xcite and nsv 12564 @xcite in figure [ fig : missing_exam ] , would be included in variable candidates among the 11 objects .",
    "the field 064d misses the largest number of known or suspected variable stars ( 236 objects ) with our conservative selection of candidates .",
    "however , its fraction is only 0.6% with respect to the total number of objects that are analyzed by our clustering method .",
    "we note that most these missing objects are identified as variable objects in the _ kepler _ field by hatnet which uses image subtraction method @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : found_exam ] presents example light curves of known or suspected variable stars matched with the simbad database and included in our conservative selection of variable candidates for the nsvs field 112a .",
    "we find 88 known or suspected variable stars among our 6,389 variable candidates in the field 112a , corresponding to about 1% .    in figure",
    "[ fig : new_exam ] , we show 12 examples of new variable candidates which are matched to any kind of known objects except variable stars in the simbad database",
    ". is not typed as variable stars in the simbad database . but this object is a known system of double stars @xcite which might have been affected by blending in the nsvs data .",
    "is also not included as a variable star in the simbad database . but",
    "@xcite suggest that this object is a red asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) variable star , supporting that the light curve shown in figure [ fig : new_exam ] exhibits true light variation .",
    "these examples show that our conservative selection of variable candidates can catch real variable objects .",
    "we also compare our variable candidates to those found by others using the nsvs data .",
    "for example , 785 rr lyrae candidates were reported already @xcite .",
    "these 781 objects are included in our conservatively selected candidates . but all 785 objects are found when we select variable candidates as objects having larger than the 99% @xmath29 cut .",
    "when we select variable candidates with the 95% @xmath29 cut , all new @xmath41 lyrae and algol - type variable candidates from @xcite are recovered with our method if they are included in our original nsvs samples .",
    "but we recover 95% of them with the conservative selection of variable candidates .",
    "about 4700 variable candidates of other kinds such as @xmath42 scuti stars and cepheid objects were also studied with the nsvs data @xcite .",
    "again , our selection with the 95% @xmath29 cut recovers most variable candidates except for objects which have different light curves due to different definitions of good photometric data and different systematic patterns in light curves @xcite .",
    "these other studies use simple rules such as 0.1 mag dispersion of light curves , which are conservative selection methods for specific types of variable candidates .",
    "therefore , the number of variable candidates is much larger in our approach than in others .      for the conservative selection of variable candidates , we find _ iras _ sources which are spatially matched to",
    "the nsvs coordinates with a search radius of 6@xmath40 in the _ iras _ point source catalog @xcite and the _ iras _ faint source catalog @xcite . among all nsvs samples , 31,852 light curves",
    "have the matching _ iras _ sources . considering the _ iras _ sources only for our conservative variable candidates , the number is 12,987 , which is about 41% .",
    "we derive two colors of the _ iras _ sources by using the _ iras _ photometric flux at 12 , 25 , and 60 @xmath43 ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ) .",
    "the conventional definition of the _ iras _ colors ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is @xmath47 where we do not apply any color corrections to the fluxes .",
    "the _ iras _ colors have been commonly used for classification of infrared sources . in particular , the two - color diagram like figure [ fig : iras_cc ] helps us understand what kind of variable candidates show variability which is relevant to the late stage of stellar evolution such as agb stars with evolved circumstellar dust @xcite . in figure [ fig :",
    "iras_cc ] , we plot the colors of _ iras _ sources with the quality number @xmath48 at all three wavelengths 12 , 25 , and 60 @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "agb stars dominate colors of @xmath49 , while planetary nebulae and young stellar objects dominate @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : iras_lc ] , we show example light curves of variable candidates that have the corresponding _ iras _ identifications .",
    "although these _ iras _ sources are not known variable stars in the simbad database , some of them have been investigated in various ways without variability information .",
    "( nsvs 513536 ) and ( nsvs 1487299 ) were found as h-@xmath52 emitting stars in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "these sources are also found as a possible variable sources in the vsx catalog ( see appendix ) .",

    "bright objects included in this paper are expected to be included in akari observations which have been conducted with two instruments far - infrared surveyor ( fis ) and infrared camera ( irc ; * ? ? ?",
    "both instruments produced all - sky source catalogs which are much deeper and spatially better resolved than _ iras _ @xcite .",

    "when multiple _ galex _ objects are matched to a single nsvs object , we choose the nearest _",

    "[ fig : galex_sdss_cc ] , we present colors of variable candidates with reliable _ galex _ and sdss photometric measurements .",
    "in addition to following the same conditions for the reliable sdss photometric measurements as in section [ sec:2mass_sdss ] , we require that the _ galex _ objects should have the distance from the center of the _ galex _ field of view @xmath72 , and both fuv and nuv magnitudes @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the fwhm angular resolution is about 6@xmath40 in the nuv channel @xcite . considering the combined effects of poor spatial resolution in the nsvs and _ galex _ data , the spatial association among the nsvs , sdss , and _",
    "galex _ objects needs a careful check when people select interesting nsvs objects with the corresponding sdss and _ galex _ objects together in our database .",
    "colors of most variable candidates presented in figure [ fig : galex_sdss_cc ] are consistent with the expected colors of normal stars @xcite , considering the galactic extinction that makes overall colors red .",
    "the color distribution of known quasars @xcite is well separated from that of stars in the diagram of ( @xmath74 ) and ( @xmath68 ) . because our variable candidates are bright objects , all of them might not be quasars but stars even though some objects seem to have quasar - like colors .",
    "hot white dwarf candidates can be selected with the color cut of ( @xmath75 ) @xmath76 and ( @xmath77 ) @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "but we warn that the multiple matches of the nsvs coordinates to both sdss and _ galex _ catalogs have worse precision than a single match to either sdss or _",
    "_ catalogs .",
    "therefore , the color combining both sdss and _ galex _ photometric data might not be reliable when the objects are faint or close to neighboring objects in the sdss and _ galex _ catalogs .",
    "since the precision of the sdss objects coordinates is much better than those of the _ galex _ catalogs , the sdss colors are more reliable than the _ galex _ colors in the color  color diagram combining both catalogs .    among the nsvs objects with the corresponding sdss and _ galex _ objects ,",
    "several simbad objects are found with further information about their properties .",
    "for example , nsvs 7609761 corresponds to and with ( @xmath75 ) @xmath79 and ( @xmath68 ) @xmath80 .",
    "this object is included in @xcite as which is a star with a spectral type of b8 . in the diagram of ( @xmath75 ) and",
    "( @xmath81 ) , nsvs 4819428 is known as a spectral type b subdwarf @xcite with ( @xmath75 ) @xmath82 and ( @xmath81 ) @xmath83 .",
    "the light curves of these two objects given in figure [ fig : galex_sdss_lc ] do not show distinctive features due to the poor sampling rate in the nsvs data .",
    "flare - like variation can be presumed from the light curve of nsvs 2744942 which is recognized as an active m dwarf , corresponding to an x - ray object @xcite .",
    "the nsvs light curve of this object shows about 1.5 mag variation even with the poor sampling rate .",
    "figure [ fig : galex_sdss_lc ] also shows the light curves of the three variable candidates which have reliable data of the sdss @xmath84 and @xmath19-band photometry as well as the _ galex _ nuv measurement .",
    "none of them have any different identification in simbad database .",
    "the light variation seems real , but the low cadence in the nsvs data does not produce complete light curves with distinctive types .",
    "a new systematic investigation of variable candidates in the nsvs data was presented with a clustering method for time - series data .",
    "assuming that the dominant fraction of light curves represents non - variable objects , our method finds clusters of light curves with their eight dimensional features , and then finds how many light curves are included in each cluster . when choosing as variable candidate objects which are not included in the top four large clusters and which have @xmath85 99% cut from the largest cluster , the total number of new variable candidate light curves is 1,824,123 in our entire sample of the nsvs data .    the cross - correlation with _ iras _ , akari , 2mass , sdss , and _",
    "catalogs helps us to identify interesting objects with specific spectral types or variability classes @xcite .",
    "in particular , variable stars over the instability strip can be selected easily from their specific colors ( e.g. , see figure [ fig : sdss_rr ] ) .",
    "we also show examples of long - period variables which can be selected from their _ iras _ , akari , or 2mass colors ( e.g. , see figures [ fig : iras_lc ] , [ fig : akari_lc ] , and [ fig:2mass_lc ] ) .",
    "our analysis is presented online with the information on cross - correlations with other catalogs .",
    "because the sampling pattern in the nsvs data is not good enough to identify detailed structures of different variability types , follow - up observations of variable candidates will be necessary to understand these variable sources by taking more photometric data points and improving the sampling rates .",
    "moreover , some variable candidates such as _ iras _ sources might be new maser sources which are interesting objects in the radio region .",
    "our approach of detecting variable candidates in the nsvs data is supplementary to previous methods of finding variable candidates .",
    "we do not claim that this method is the best way in all cases .",
    "definitely , if observation systems , including instruments , environments , and data reduction procedures , are well known prior or are well controlled , supervised methods can be superior than unsupervised methods like our approach because supervised methods can simulate observing systems with known variable and non - variables sources to find the best separation between variable and non - variable sources .",
    "this separation can be applied to detect new variable candidates in the test data .",
    "therefore , when the data properties , including all kinds of systematic patterns and real variability patterns , are understood and modeled well , detecting variable sources becomes a _ classification _ problem instead of a _ clustering _",
    "problem .",
    "our analysis results can be used with many different methods of selecting variable candidates . in this paper ,",
    "our conservative selection method is avoiding the top four large clusters and objects with @xmath86 99% .",
    "however , when people are interested in infrared variable sources , they can choose as variable candidate objects corresponding to _ iras _ objects with @xmath85 90% .",
    "if known variable objects can produce clusters with reasonable sizes , finding clusters with many known variable objects can be an efficient way to find variable candidates .",
    "unfortunately , this approach is not feasible now because the number of known variable objects is too small in each nsvs observation field .",
    "several variability surveys cover the same apparent magnitude ranges as the nsvs does .",
    "a large fraction of sky has been already observed in the all sky automated survey ( asas ; * ? ? ? * ) and superwasp @xcite .",
    "our approach of variability detection can be applied to those data sets too .",
    "in addition , objects included in both the nsvs and others can be combined to extend the span of time - series data or to complement different sampling patterns .",
    "we plan to update the online database with these additional data sets in the future .",
    "furthermore , because almost all objects included in our analysis will be monitored by the _ gaia _",
    "mission for five years @xcite , our analysis will be combined with the future time - series data and astrometric / kinematic information .",
    "our method can also be improved to catch much broader types of variable objects and objects with weak variability signals . for this purpose , it is important to include various features of light curves as we emphasized in section [ sec : gmm ] . in particular , the usage of aovm as one feature of light curves is strongly limited because a complete form of a periodogram has more information of light curves .",
    "therefore , it must be useful to develop new features describing periodograms more completely if the new features can be estimated in computationally cheap ways .",
    "moreover , stetson s @xmath87 index @xcite can be included in our method if data include multi - band light curves .",
    "for instance , @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be derived in each band , while @xmath87 is estimated with multi - band light curves .",
    "our usage of @xmath7 can also be changed to use all pairs of data points instead of using sequential pairs .",

    "<S> we present variability analysis of data from the northern sky variability survey ( nsvs ) . using the clustering method which defines variable candidates as outliers from large clusters , we cluster 16,189,040 light curves , having data points at more than 15 epochs , as variable and non - variable candidates in 638 nsvs fields . </S>",
    "<S> variable candidates are selected depending on how strongly they are separated from the largest cluster and how rarely they are grouped together in eight dimensional space spanned by variability indices . </S>",
    "<S> all nsvs light curves are also cross - correlated to the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ , akari , two micron all sky survey , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and _ galaxy evolution explorer _ objects as well as known objects in the simbad database . </S>",
    "<S> the variability analysis and cross - correlation results are provided in a public online database which can be used to select interesting objects for further investigation . adopting conservative selection criteria for variable candidates , we find about 1.8 million light curves as possible variable candidates in the nsvs data , corresponding to about 10% of our entire nsvs samples . </S>",
    "<S> multi - wavelength colors help us find specific types of variability among the variable candidates . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we also use morphological classification from other surveys such as sdss to suppress spurious cases caused by blending objects or extended sources due to the low angular resolution of the nsvs . </S>"
