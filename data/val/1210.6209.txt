    "rough set theory  @xcite was first proposed by pawlak as a mathematical tool for imperfect data analysis . through two definable subsets which are the lower and upper approximations , rough set theory deals with the approximation of an arbitrary subset of a universe , and discovers rules from data without priori knowledge .",
    "it has been successfully applied into feature selection  @xcite , rule extraction  @xcite , uncertainty reasoning  @xcite , decision evaluation  @xcite , granular computing  @xcite and so on .",
    "rough set theory is based on equivalence relations or partitions . in recent years , many extensions of classical rough sets have been proposed .",
    "for example , through relaxing the partitions to coverings , several covering - based rough sets have been proposed  @xcite . in these covering - based rough sets ,",
    "the concept of covering of a universe was presented to construct the lower and upper approximations of an arbitrary set .",
    "matroid theory  @xcite was proposed by whitney as a generalization of linear independence in vector spaces .",

    "a matroid can be defined by dozens of ways , which provides a well platform to connect it with other theories .",
    "some authors have connected matroid theory with classical rough sets  @xcite , covering - based rough sets  @xcite , generalized rough sets based on relations  @xcite , fuzzy theory  @xcite and so on . in application , it has widely been used in many fields , such as combinatorial optimization  @xcite and algorithm design  @xcite .    in this paper , a new type of matroids",
    "is proposed , which is called partition - circuit matroid . through partitions ,",
    "we build the connection between rough sets with matroids . and some characteristics of partition - circuit matroids and the dual matroids of them are studied through rough sets and the lower and upper approximation numbers .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are two folds . on the one hand ,",
    "a partition satisfies the circuit axioms of matroid theory  @xcite , then a type of matroids , called partition - circuit matroids , are induced by partitions .",
    "any partition has a one - to - one correspondence with an equivalence relation on the same universe .",
