    "one of the major problems in modern physics is to combine quantum physics and gravitation .",
    "the most promising candidate to solve this problem seems to be string theory because it includes all symmetry groups of the standard model , however , it introduces additional space dimensions @xcite . from the present ( non-)observation of these dimensions",
    "it is concluded that they are compactified and their size was assumed to be on the planck scale .",
    "however , string theory itself does not give any stringent constraints on the size of the extra dimensions other than non - observability so far .",
    "this opens a possibility for gravity - only extra dimensions , assuming that only gravitons are able to enter these additional dimensions .",
    "the size of these dimensions is then primarily constraint by direct measurements of the gravitational inverse square law .",
    "however , the strength of gravitational interactions has only been measured down to a scale of some micrometers @xcite . below this scale",
    "some modification of the gravitational force law is still possible .",
    "this allows to introduce a new fundamental scale of gravity @xmath2 in the tev - range .",
    "these large extra dimensions models ( lxds ) have compactification radii up to @xmath3 m and a new fundamental scale in the tev range @xcite . if the new scale of gravity is indeed not far beyond the electro - weak scale , it might be reachable in future collider experiments at lhc and beyond or in cosmic ray observatories like auger or icecube . at center of mass energies above the new fundamental scale @xmath4",
    "the lxds become important and first observable effects of quantum gravity might be observable . a multitude of new effects have been predicted in the recent years to obtain deeper insight into this exciting field ranging from kaluza - klein graviton production and increased neutrino cross sections to black hole production @xcite .",
    "apart from these promising phenomena , present day observations also allow for direct and indirect constraints on the new fundamental scale and the size of the lxds :    * a fundamental scale in the tev - range does not allow a single lxd as the compactification radius would get in the order of the size of our solar system and we would have noticed .",
    "* for higher numbers of lxds the compactification radius does not exceed the @xmath5m - scale as shown by the mentioned short distance experiments .",
    "* even smaller distances can be probed in collider experiments . at the moment",
    "the highest center of mass energies are reached in hadron - hadron collisions at tevatron with 2 tev cm - energy which sets a bound of @xmath6 tev for 2 down to 0.7 tev for 6 lxds @xcite . *",
    "other bounds are set by supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "the cooling of the supernovae is modified by the production of gravitons which is very sensitive to the number of lxds in the reached energy region . for 2 lxds",
    "a bound of about 500 tev is obtained . however , for any higher number of lxds the bounds are lower than from the collider experiments .    in the last years",
    "it was recognized that cosmic rays ( crs ) provide an excellent laboratory to study the onset of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the initial energies of uhecrs exceeds @xmath7  gev ( @xmath8  tev ) and might therefore allow one to probe tev scale large extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "especially the radiation of gravitational waves in models with large extra dimensions is strongly enhanced compared to standard general relativity . as will be discussed later",
    ", this might lead to observable signatures and modifications of the reconstructed flux and energy estimates for uhecrs .    to explore the effect of gravitational energy loss in cosmic ray air - showers , we use the differential cross section for gravitationally radiated energy in quasi - elastic scatterings as calculated in @xcite for @xmath9 processes .",
    "then we apply the result to cosmic ray air shower simulations and extract the impact on cosmic ray observables .",
    "first estimates to study effects of gravitational energy loss of crs due to the presence of extra dimensions were explored by @xcite . there , the presence of large extra dimensions was incorporated into the well known results from general relativity @xcite by a change of the phase space seen by the emitted gravitational wave . the additional phase space factor for the emitted gravitational wave",
    "was given by @xmath10 note that @xmath11 .",
    "where @xmath12 is the compactification radius of the extra dimensions in the add scenario given by @xcite : @xmath13 here , @xmath4 is the new fundamental scale and @xmath14 is the four dimensional planck mass related to the gravitational constant by @xmath15 .",
    "this method led to a strong modification of the reconstructed energy spectrum and the authors concluded that the steepening of the cr energy spectrum around @xmath16  ev ( the  knee  ) might be due to gravitational energy loss .",
    "however , from our present studies ( see also @xcite ) it seems that a calculation of the effects of the gravitational energy loss requires a more elaborate treatment as will be discussed now",

    "( [ eq_dedomdom5 ] ) as soon as the wavelength of the gravitational wave is smaller than the compactification radius @xmath12 of the extra dimensions and the gravitational wave can propagate freely into the bulk .",
    "rephrased as a condition for @xmath37 this constrained becomes @xmath38 a lower bound on @xmath37 is not relevant for the energy loss discussion , because the major contribution to the radiated energy comes from the high energy ( i.e. large @xmath37 ) part . to calculate the energy loss due to the gravitational wave emission one has to perform the @xmath39 , the @xmath40 , the @xmath41 and the @xmath42 integrals",
