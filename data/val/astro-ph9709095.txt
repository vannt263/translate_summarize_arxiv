    "+ chang ( 1996 ) pointed out that strong localized peaks in the energy variations of a damped oscillator excited stochastically do not necessarily correspond to a strong excitation , but rather to an exceptional coherent addition of random phases .",
    "+ this is true provided that the number of independent excitations per damping time of the mode is large enough , like in the case of excitation by solar granules . in this context , two different modes excited by exactly the same sources would have uncorrelated energies .",
    "+ different modes , however , would be correlated , if the timescale between two excitations from a common source were longer than their damping time .",
    "+ the correlation between the modes energies is therefore directly related to the characteristics of their source of excitation .",
    "+ using 160 days of iphir data at the end of 1988 ( just before the solar maximum , @xmath6 ) , baudin ( 1996 ) concluded that the p modes were likely to be correlated .",
    "an anticorrelation between the mean solar magnetic field and the p - mode power was found by gavryusev & gavryuseva ( 1997 ) in iphir data , while no clear correlation has been detected yet in golf data ( baudin 1997 ) .",

    "+ frequency resolution is not required for our study . since the distribution of energy is likely to be mathematically simpler than the distribution of power ( kumar , franklin & goldreich 1988 ) , we have prefered to extract the energy directly .",
