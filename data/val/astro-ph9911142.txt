    "damped ly@xmath4 ( dla ) and  21 cm absorption lines are the spectral signatures of systems with high neutral hydrogen column densities .",
    "such systems are the major contributors to the mass density of neutral gas at high redshifts ( @xmath10 ) . despite the success of several surveys to identify dla absorption lines in both the optical ( cf .",
    "wolfe et al . 1986 ; lanzetta et al . 1991 ; wolfe et al .",
    "1995 ; storrie - lombardi et al . 1996 ) and the uv regimes ( cf .",
    "lanzetta , wolfe , & turnshek 1995 ; rao & turnshek 1999 ) , our understanding of the morphology and evolution of the host galaxies in which they arise remains poor . until recently ,",
    "most of the known dla systems were at high redshift , making identification and study of the host galaxy difficult .    the profiles of associated metal lines in these systems are consistent with the hypothesis that dlas arise in rapidly rotating large disks with substantial vertical scale heights ( prochaska & wolfe 1997 , 1998 ) , which fits well with the standard paradigm that dlas arise in luminous disk galaxies or their progenitors ( cf .",
    "wolfe et al . 1995 ) .",
    "however , there is a growing body of evidence in both theory and observations that this model might not be applicable to all dla absorbers .",
    "one theory suggests that the interactions of relatively small systems or even proto - galactic clumps might account for the line profiles and neutral column densities of these absorbers ( rauch , haehnelt , & steinmetz 1997 ; haehnelt , steinmetz , & rauch 1998 ) . a number of spectral and imaging studies of low and moderate redshift dlas have identified a variety of host galaxies with moderate to high luminosities , including compact objects and amorphous lsb galaxies as well as spiral disks ( steidel et al .",

    "just as the morphology of dla systems is poorly understood , so are their physical conditions , and in particular the temperature of the gas in which the absorption arises . under usual conditions in the ism , the excitation , or spin temperature , @xmath11 , describing the hyperfine level populations in the ground state of neutral hydrogen",
    "is coupled to its thermal kinetic temperature , t@xmath12 .",
    "a harmonic mean spin temperature , , of all of the neutral clouds on a given sightline can be determined by a comparison of absorption and an inferred 21 cm emission profile for the same sightline , or by comparison of the 21 cm absorption line parameters to a column density from the dla absorption feature on the same sightline .",
    "however the values of  derived in this manner for redshifted dla/  21 cm absorbers are consistently higher than those found in clouds of similar optical depth in the galaxy ( cf .",

    "the two dla absorption systems identified in the uv spectrum of the @xmath13 qso b0738 + 313 ( oi 363 ) , are both examples of low - redshift absorbers with no corresponding luminous disk galaxy ( rao & turnshek 1998 ) .",
    "they are both  21 cm absorbers , and both have very narrow 21 cm lines ( lane et al .",
    "1998 ; chengalur & kanekar 1999 ) . the first absorber is the lowest redshift system for which the dla line has been observed ( note that the `` dla system '' at @xmath14 km s@xmath3 reported by miller , knezek , & bregman ( 1999 ) was not observed in the lyman lines , and a measurement of x - ray absorption was used to infer the neutral hi column density ) .",
    "it has a redshift @xmath15 and a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "it was discovered serendipitously in a hst - fos spectrum taken to observe the ly-@xmath4 line associated with the previously known metal - line absorption system at @xmath18 on the same sightline .",
    "this second system is also damped , with a slightly lower column density of @xmath19 @xmath17 . in ground - based optical images",
    "only one candidate host galaxy is visible near the qso sightline .",
    "based on its optical brightness and the assumption that it is a moderatly luminous galaxy , this candidate absorber has been associated with the higher redshift system , although it has no confirming spectroscopic redshift ( lebrun et al .",
    "the other absorption system must arise in either an lsb galaxy or a small galaxy which falls under the psf of the qso ( rao & turnshek 1998 ) .",
    "here we present new information on the lower redshift ( @xmath20 ) system on the b0738 + 313 sightline .",
    "very little is known about the associated metal lines , because the wavelength coverage of the only published optical spectrum ( boiss ' e et al . 1992 ) does not include the expected wavelengths of any strong lines belonging to this system , while the hst - fos spectrum ( rao & turnshek 1998 ) has insufficient signal to noise and resolution to allow the detection of small equivalent width lines .",
    "we present wht / isis observations of caii h and k , the only metal lines observed so far in this system .",
    "we discuss observations of the  21 cm absorption made with the vla ( very large array ) , and the arecibo radio telescope , and the estimates of temperature which we derive from them .",
    "we also present very long baseline array ( vlba)@xmath21 data which was used to investigate the line characteristics and gas covering factor on parsec , or cloud scales . because the vlba achieves subarcsecond resolution , data from these observations provide a fair comparison to the optical data .",
    "the initial redshift determination of the @xmath22 absorber on the b0738 + 313 sightline had an unreasonably large uncertainty due largely to the difficulties in fitting damped absorption profiles , and the low signal to noise of the hst detection spectrum . because an accurate redshift facilitates the search for associated 21 cm absorption , observations were made of strong metal lines which fall in the optical window at this redshift .",
    "spectra were obtained using the wht+isis in service mode on the night of 1997 november 9 - 10 , by r. rutten .",
    "the detector was the 2148x4200 eev10 ccd .",
    "we used the r600b grating with a central wavelength of 4300  , so that the spectrum covers the range @xmath23 3420 5200 .",
    "the slit was oriented along the parallactic angle ; its width was 1.00 \" leading to a spectral resolution of @xmath24 .",
    "two exposures of 900s and one exposure of 1800s were obtained , for a total integration time of 1 hour .",
    "the data were reduced with standard midas procedures .",
    "an excerpt of the resulting spectrum is presented in fig .",
    "1 . it shows the ca ii h and k absorption lines with rest equivalent widths of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , at a mean redshift @xmath27 , where the uncertainty represents mainly the rms of the wavelength calibration .",
    "no significant absorption is seen at the expected positions for fe i @xmath283720 , al i @xmath283945 , or ca i @xmath284227 . for completeness , we note that the large peak near 4570   is mg ii emission from the qso ( z=0.63 ) , and the region between 4050 and 4320   contains a complex of emission lines attributed to fe ii @xmath282500 .",
    "the vla was used in d - array configuration for 4 hours on 1998 january 3 to look for associated  21 cm absorption at the redshift of the caii lines .",
    "the sources 3c147 and b0735 + 331 were used to calibrate the amplitude and passband .",
    "the observations were made in 2 polarizations , with a bandwidth of 3.125 mhz and 128 channels for a channel separation of 5.6 km / s .",
    "the data were reduced using standard routines in aips .",
    "an unresolved 21 cm absorption line was observed at a redshift of @xmath29 , with an optical depth @xmath30 and a fwhm velocity @xmath31 km s@xmath3 . by comparing the 21 cm line characteristics with the column density from the dla measurement ( see equations in section 5 ) , a harmonic mean spin temperature of @xmath32 k",
    "was derived .",
    "this temperature represents a column density weighted harmonic mean of the spin temperatures of all of the neutral gas clouds along the sightline .",
    "the derived harmonic mean spin temperature is typical of values found in most other redshifted 21cm / dla absorbers , and is considerably higher than typical values at similar optical depths in the milky way ( lane et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath0 line was observed on 1998 october 8 for just under 6 hours , using the vlba array , as part of a project that observed both 21 cm lines on this qso sightline simultaneously .",
    "all 10 vlba stations participated in the experiment , but due to technical problems , data from kitt peak and los alamos were not useful .",
    "pie town had a clock error which was corrected halfway through the experiment .",
    "the compact source b0742 + 103 was observed for calibration purposes .",
    "the data were reduced using standard routines in the aips data reduction package .",
    "the vlba system has a poor response at 1163 mhz , so the observations of the @xmath33 system provided little useful information .    at 1302 mhz the qso center",
    "is lightly resolved into a core and an extended component , as shown in figure 3 , and all of the `` core '' flux from unresolved observations is recovered .",
    "the symmetric , weak , extended lobes , which lie at roughly 30@xmath34 to the north and south of the quasar ( murphy , brown , & perley 1993 ) , have been resolved away .",
    "spectra from three locations across the qso have been extracted .",
    "the upper spectrum is offset by one synthesized beam ( fwhp ) to the north ; the lower offset is one beam to the south , and two beams to the east , corresponding to a position along the extension of the qso .",
    "although nearly 65% of the continuum level in the upper spectrum is due to contaminating signal from the center sightline , the lower position is nearly completely independent and is unlikely to be contaminated at a detectable level .",
    "the total shift in position on the sky between the center and lowermost sightline is 13.2 mas , which corresponds to 20 @xmath35 pc at the redshift of the absorber .",
    "the arecibo radio telescope was used to make three one - hour on source integrations of the 1665 and 1667 mhz oh lines in the two absorption systems on the b0738 + 313 sightline . given the narrowness of the 21 cm absorption features at both redshifts ( lane et al .",
    "1998 ; chengalur & kanekar 1999 ) , we knew that the absorbing clouds must be very cold and therefore might contain detectable molecular gas .",
    "the observations were carried out by k. oneill on 1998 november 30 and 1998 december 1&3 . using the post - upgrade system , the l - band wide receiver , and the new autocorrelation spectrometer , it was possible to observe both oh lines at the redshifts of both dla systems simultaneously by placing 4 bandpass subcorrelators at appropriate frequencies .",
    "a bandwidth of 3.125 mhz and 1024 channels gave a velocity resolution of 0.7 km s@xmath3 in two polarizations .",
    "the observations were made in an on / off `` total power '' mode .",
    "total power spectra for the calibration source 3c236 were processed to form gain templates for the spectral passbands , and these templates were applied to the b0738 + 313 difference spectra using analyz software .",
    "the band placed around the oh 1665 mhz line at @xmath20 was corrupted by interference , and could not be used .",
    "no oh was detected in the other three bands ( oh 1667 mhz at @xmath20 and both oh 1667 and 1665 mhz at @xmath18 ) , which were hanning smoothed to a velocity resolution of @xmath36 km s@xmath3 and had a 3@xmath37 detection limit of @xmath38 .    on 1999",
    "april 24 - 25 , we observed the 21 cm line in the @xmath20 system for 45 minutes on source using the on / off observation technique , in two polarizations .",
    "placing 2048 channels across the 3.125 mhz bandwidth gave a velocity resolution of 0.35 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the nearby source j0745 + 317 was observed as a calibrator .",
    "after gain calibration and averaging , a linear baseline was removed from the data using analyz to produce the spectrum shown in figure 2 .",
    "two narrow absorption lines , the principal component observed in the vla data and the weak secondary component first seen in the gmrt spectrum of chengular & kanekar ( 1999 ) , are clearly resolved and separated from each other in the arecibo spectrum .",
    "in fitting the absorption features we assume that the signal from any 21 cm emission in this system is negligible .",
    "a sensitive wsrt spectrum ( w. lane , in preparation ) has placed a 3@xmath37 upper limit to the  mass of m@xmath39 m@xmath40 for an assumed velocity spread of 100 km s@xmath3 and h@xmath41 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 . at the velocity resolution of the arecibo observations",
    ", this limit falls well within the spectral noise .",
    "the neutral hydrogen column density in the 21 cm line can be calculated using the standard equation : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the fraction of the continuum source covered by the absorber , t@xmath44 is the spin temperature of the gas , and @xmath45 is the integral of the optical depth over the velocity range of the line in units of km s@xmath3 . for a single line with a gaussian profile , @xmath46 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the peak optical depth of the line at the line center and @xmath49 is the fwhm velocity in km s@xmath3 .",
    "the covering factor @xmath43 of the gas in 21 cm absorbers is usually assumed to be @xmath50 for compact qsos , based on a variety of arguments ( cf .",
    "carilli et al .",
    "vlbi measurements can be used to refine estimates for @xmath43 for more complex sources ( briggs & wolfe 1983 ) .",
    "adoption of a value for @xmath43 allows a calculation of either the column density , if the temperature is known , or of the temperature if the neutral column density is known from a dla measurement .",
    "b0738 + 313 is a core dominated quasar , with only @xmath51 of its total flux found in weak lobes which extend @xmath52 north and south of the core at this frequency ( w. lane , in preparation ; murphy et al .",
    "1993 ) . new wsrt observations ( w. lane , in preparation ) find no evidence for the presence of the main component line against the extended lobes , and any other absorption is ruled out at 3@xmath37 optical depths of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , for velocity resolution @xmath55 km s@xmath3 ) over velocities in a range of several hundred km s@xmath3 to either side of the main component redshift .",
    "this implies that the covering factor of the absorbing gas is @xmath56 over the entire qso .    within the errors ,",
    "the width , depth and redshift of the main absorption line do not change across the core of the quasar in the vlba data .",
    "the size scale and low velocity dispersion of the gas causing the main absorption feature suggest that it belongs to a single cold cloud or cloud complex .",
    "more sensitive vlba measurements would be necessary to determine if the weak secondary absorption is also present over this size scale , or is part of a smaller scale feature .",
    "the constancy of the primary line characteristics over the slightly resolved core in the vlba data suggests that it is completely covered ( @xmath57 ) by the absorbing gas in that component , and we assume this is true for the second weaker component as well .",
    "we therefore adopt the view that the absorbing gas entirely covers the core but not the extended weak lobes , and that the covering factor of the gas is @xmath58 .",
    "the extreme narrowness of the absorption features ( as measured in the arecibo data ) places firm upper limits on the amount of thermal broadening in the lines , and consequently on any turbulence or bulk motions of the absorbing gas . as a result ,",
    "an upper limit to the kinetic temperature for each cloud can be found directly from the widths of the lines , without having to rely on a comparison between the dla and 21 cm line characteristics to calculate a harmonic mean spin temperature for the entire ensemble of clouds which lie on the sightline .",
    "the kinetic temperature of the gas is related to the width of the absorption line by : @xmath59 where @xmath49 is the fwhm velocity measured in km s@xmath3 .",
    "a simultaneous two component fit to the arecibo spectrum left large residuals and had a reduced @xmath60 . by adding a third component to the fit ,",
    "the reduced @xmath61 , and the residuals were all within the noise .",
    "the first or main component has a velocity width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath62 km s@xmath3 , and an optical depth of @xmath63 .",
    "it lies at a heliocentric frequency of 1301.6496 mhz , corresponding to @xmath64 .",
    "the second , weaker line is separated from the first by @xmath65 km s@xmath3 .",
    "it has a fwhm velocity of @xmath66 km s@xmath3 and an optical depth @xmath67 .",
    "the third component has an optical depth @xmath68 and fwhm velocity @xmath69 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the absorption is shifted by @xmath70 km s@xmath3 with respect to the main narrow absorption feature .",
    "attempts to force the third component to lie at the position of either of the other two components resulted in much poorer fits .",
    "figure 4 shows the arecibo spectrum after the fits to the first two components have been removed .",
    "the fit to the third component has been marked , and the residuals after removing all three gaussian fits are shown . parameters for each of the absorption components are summarized in table 1 .    using equation ( 3 ) , the kinetic temperature is @xmath71 k for the main component and @xmath72 k for the secondary line .",
    "both of these temperatures would fall within the scatter in the galactic relation for -@xmath73 ( braun & walterbos 1992 ) , unlike the considerably higher temperature @xmath32 k that was derived earlier .",
    "this is the first redshifted system for which it can be shown that @xmath8 is less than , ie . that the kinetic temperature in the individual cold phase gas clouds is less than the derived harmonic mean spin temperature for all of the neutral gas on the sightline .",
    "the kinetic temperature of the third line , derived from the velocity width of the line , is @xmath74 k , in reasonable agreement with measurements of temperature in the wnm of our own galaxy ( kulkarni & heiles 1988 ; carilli , dwarakanath & goss 1998 ) , where typical temperatures fall in the range 5000 - 8000 k.    for a given cloud , @xmath75 @xmath8 under usual conditions found in the ism ( kulkarni & heiles 1988 ) .",
    "for the two cold absorption components , we set @xmath76 @xmath8 and @xmath77 ( because the arecibo beam covers both the core and the extended lobes of the quasar ) , and calculate the column density for each 21 cm line component from equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . adding the two together , and bearing in mind that our values for @xmath8 are upper limits",
    ", we find a total column of @xmath78 @xmath17 in the narrow absorption features .",
    "this is approximately one third of the measured  column density in the dla line : @xmath79 @xmath17 ( rao & turnshek , 1998 ) .",
    "the calculated column density in the warm component is  @xmath80 @xmath17 for a covering factor of @xmath81 .",
    "although we do not have the needed sensitivity to determine the core covering factor for this component in the vlba data , warm gas in our galaxy is distributed more widely and more uniformly than the cold gas ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) , so it seems unlikely that the gas would have a lower core covering factor than the cold gas .",
    "there is the possibility that the warm gas covers one or both of the weak extended radio lobes as well as the core ( ie . that @xmath82 ) , but given that @xmath83 kpc at @xmath20 , it seems unlikely .",
    "the absorption limits against the extended lobes ( w. lane , in preparation ) and the @xmath45 of the warm absorption in the arecibo spectrum rule out the possibility that the absorption covers one of the lobes but not the core as well .",
    "when the warm and cold component column densities are added together , the total column density in 21 cm absorption on this sightline is @xmath84 @xmath17 .",
    "this is in remarkable agreement with the column density from the fit to the dla line .",
    "the existence of a second gas phase has often been suggested to explain the large harmonic mean spin temperature values , typically  @xmath85 k ( cf .",
    "carilli et al .",
    "1996 ) found in redshifted dla/21 cm absorbers .",
    "if the gas on the sightline has two ( or more ) temperature phases , then the @xmath11 calculated by comparing the 21 cm and dla absorption profiles will not be equal to the kinetic temperature in either phase , but rather to a column - density weighted harmonic mean of the temperature of each phase .",
    "thus a sightline with mostly warm phase gas will have a higher calculated  than one with mostly or only cold phase gas .",
    "the values found for  can then best be interpreted as an upper limit to the temperature of the cold phase gas . when this quantity is derived for redshifted systems , it is usually a value somewhere between the measured temperatures of stable cold and stable warm neutral gas in our own galaxy . in most redshifted 21 cm absorbers ,",
    "the absorption lines are broadened by bulk kinematic motions of the gas , and the limit on the kinetic temperature is higher than that of the .",
    "this is the first redshifted 21 cm absorber measured for which the calculated thermal @xmath8 which constrains the cold gas temperature more tightly than the derived , and shows directly that not all of the gas column density seen in the dla line appears in the cold components of the 21 cm line , as we expect from the value of .",
    "it suggests that some two - thirds of the column density on this sightline , if not more , is contained in warm phase gas .",
    "if the broad shallow component we have detected in our arecibo data were to be resolved by more sensitive observations into a collection of shallow narrow absorptions lines , then the conclusion that warm phase gas is necessary to explain all of the dla fitted neutral column density in this system would still remain .",
    "the integrated  in such an ensemble of little narrow cold components would be very small , and we would still need to find the rest of the gas sensed by the dla observation",
    ". the logical place for it to be `` hiding '' from the 21 cm absorption measurement would still be in a warm neutral component , appearing as an even broader and shallower absorption feature .",
    "this system offers an explanation for why some dla absorbers which fall in front of radio - bright qsos do not show 21 cm absorption .",
    "there is  @xmath86 @xmath17 column of gas which was `` unseen '' in the 21 cm spectrum until extremely sensitive observations were made .",
    "this amount is well over the canonical lower limit for dla systems , and its existence here suggests that some fraction of the dla systems may arise in entirely warm phase gas .",
    "this idea is strengthened by the lower limits found on  for 21 cm non - detections , which are typically several times 10@xmath87 k , suggestive of either unstable or warm phase gas ( wnm ) ( carilli et al .",
    "given that the wnm is more widely and uniformly distributed than the cnm in our own galaxy ( cf .",
    "dickey & lockman 1990 ) and in observations of local dwarfs ( young & lo 1996,1997 ) , it seems likely that the gas responsible for any detection of dla absorption would include a large fraction of warm phase neutral gas .    in conclusion , we are able to derive not only a harmonic mean spin temperature for the b0738 + 313 system , but also a thermal kinetic temperature for the gas in the narrow - line absorbing clouds . for the first time in a redshifted  21 cm absorber , the kinetic temperature derived from the velocity width of the absorption is observed to be smaller than the derived spin temperature .",
    "the neutral gas must be split into warm and cold phases in order to account for this discrepancy .",
    "we find that the 21 cm absorption spectrum is best fit by three components ; two narrow deep lines , assumed to arise in cold gas with @xmath88 & @xmath89 k , and a broad shallow absorption feature which we identify with the warm phase gas at @xmath90 k. within the errors , all of the neutral hydrogen column density seen in the dla measurement is recovered by these three 21 cm absorption components .",
    "this is the first detection of warm phase gas in absorption in an extragalactic system , and the highest redshift detection of warm neutral phase gas known .",
    "it is also the first time limits on temperature have been made in a redshifted dla system which show a two temperature distribution of the neutral gas , comparable to that found in our own galaxy .",
