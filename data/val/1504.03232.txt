    "the rise of economic inequality has become , in recent times , cause for serious concern and the object of frequent debates .",
    "inequality is increasing in several countries and also appears to be accompanied by a diminution of social mobility .",
    "this combination is especially harmful , because it frustrates the attempts of many individuals to move up the income ladder and improve their situation .",
    "empirical surveys confirm the existence of a negative correlation between mobility and inequality @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore very important to highlight the fundamental causes of this correlation .",
    "our aim in this paper is to explore these themes through mathematical methods , by providing a suitable definition of mobility and by comparing the possible scenarios compatible with different policies and conditions . in this connection",
    ", we introduce some indicators apt to measure various aspects of mobility within a family of kinetic - type models for the description of economic exchanges in a closed society .",
    "we investigate the relationship between economic inequality and mobility by analyzing income distributions emerging from different fiscal and welfare systems .",
    "the output of a large number of simulations shows clear evidence of a negative correlation between mobility and equality , in agreement with the qualitative features of real world situations",
    ". the models also allow to study the simultaneous dependence of the gini index and the mobility parameters on taxation rates and welfare means - testing , and to track variations in the mobility of different income classes .",
    "in particular , it turns out ( the simulations suggest ) that there are , with reference to variables measuring welfare and taxation , lines on which both the gini index and the mobility parameter are constant .",
    "our approach fits in with a complex system perspective , in the sense that we find the emergence of collective macro - level patterns out of a whole of interactions occurring at the micro level .",
    "the need of considering , when dealing with socio - economic questions , a multiplicity of individual interactions rather than a representative agent is highlighted and advocated e.g. in @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , agent based computational models have been typically developed and applied within the economics community , @xcite . on the other side , during the last two decades a number of physicists have started to tackle economic and financial questions by using tools of statistical physics , see e.g. @xcite and the recent review @xcite .",
    "the reason for that naturally arises from certain analogies existing between markets or populations of individuals who exchange money and particle systems or gases in which molecules collide exchanging energy . in particular , as illustrated below , our methods and models allow , thanks to their characteristic features , the definition and investigation of a mobility concept .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section @xmath2 sets up a framework for the description of monetary exchanges in a closed society . in section",
    "@xmath3 a family of models is constructed within this framework . in the fourth section the concept of social mobility",
    "is shortly discussed and quantitative indicators to measure it are introduced . hence , the correlation between the economic inequality and mobility is explored .",
    "finally , a summary is contained in the last section .",
    "moving from a stylized description of the complex of monetary exchanges which take place in a closed market society , we outline in this section a discrete - type framework suitable for its modelling .",
    "this framework was proposed and discussed in our previous works @xcite , but we give here a slightly different introduction .",
    "the problem at issue concerns the formation of the income distribution curve and the economic inequality in a population of constant size .",
    "if the variable @xmath4 denotes the individual income and @xmath5 the density of the population having income @xmath6 , one could say that the total population and the total income are given by @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively . however , it is quite natural and also convenient in view of a numerical treatment of the problem to divide the population into a finite number of classes . toward this goal",
    ", we consider the @xmath9 numbers @xmath10 with @xmath11 so large as to represent a sort of supremum of the possible income of any individual in the given society .",
    "for simplicity we assume the density of the population whose income belongs to the interval @xmath12 to be constant and denote it by @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "the fraction of individuals having income in @xmath12 is then @xmath15 and its income is @xmath16 we refer to the class of individuals with income in @xmath12 as to the @xmath17-th class and to its individuals as to @xmath17-individuals .",
    "an immediate consequence of @xmath18 and @xmath19 is that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the average income of individuals in the @xmath17-th class .",
    "we assume that pairwise monetary exchanges take place between single individuals .",
    "a `` microscopic '' description of this can be as follows : when an @xmath22-individual pays to a @xmath23-individual an amount of money @xmath24 ( with @xmath25 for all @xmath26 ) , the @xmath22-th class gets slightly poorer , while the @xmath23-th class gets slightly richer .",
    "this induces a retrocession of a portion of the population of the @xmath22-th to the @xmath27-th class and an advance of a portion of the @xmath23-th population to the @xmath28-th class .",
    "easy calculations show that , if the total population and the total income have to remain unchanged as happens in the conservative case dealt with here , then the variations of population in the @xmath22-th and in the @xmath23-th class are given by @xmath29 how often monetary exchanges can occur can be postulated through the definition of suitable terms @xmath30 for @xmath31 , with each @xmath30 accounting for the encounter frequency rate of individuals of the @xmath22-th and in the @xmath23-th class and expressing as well the probability that in an encounter between an @xmath22-individual and a @xmath23-individual , the one who pays is the @xmath22-individual .",
    "the possibility that none of the two pays has to be taken into account as well .",
    "hence , for any @xmath22 and @xmath23 in @xmath32 , the inequalities @xmath33 and @xmath34 have to hold true . apart from that , the values of the @xmath30 should be determined based on phenomenological observations .",
    "a specific choice for the values of the @xmath30 will be done in the third section of this note .    beside direct money exchanges",
    ", we also assume the existence of a process of taxation and redistribution . if we imagine that the money received form the @xmath23-individual is subject to taxation with a tax rate equal to @xmath35 , supposing ( at least as a first case study ) that the @xmath23-individual pays the due tax , we observe that the entire operation is equivalent to one in which the @xmath22-individual pays a quantity @xmath24 , the @xmath23-individual earns a quantity @xmath36 , and the quantity @xmath37 goes to the government .",
    "we then imagine , here again postulating an irreproachable situation , that the government redistributes the tax revenue ( which is just @xmath37 for the single mentioned interaction ) to the entire population through the provision of welfare services : education , health assistance and so on .",
    "at this step , we observe that in fact the government intervention can be ignored , since the mechanism can be equivalently described as follows : in correspondence to the mentioned _ direct _ interaction between an @xmath22-individual and a @xmath23-individual , individuals of all classes receive an amount of money corresponding to a returned tax portion .",
    "in other words , the taxation and redistribution effect is equivalent to the effect of an _ indirect _ interaction between the paying @xmath22-individual and all others .- th class . indeed ,",
    "if an individual of the @xmath38th class would receive some money , the possibility would arise for him to advance to a higher class , which is impossible .",
    "] of course , the indirect interactions too contribute to the possibility of class change of individuals .    in order to formalize the overall mechanism described so far we introduce",

    "in order to construct a specific model or model family , we start by fixing specific values for the @xmath30 . we take them as @xmath51 with the exception of the terms @xmath52 for @xmath53 , @xmath54 for @xmath55 , @xmath56 for @xmath57 , @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "this choice is suggested by the consideration that poorer individuals typically earn and pay smaller amounts than richer ones and do so less frequently .",

    "for both of them the proof of the corresponding result established in @xcite and referring in fact to a slightly different model can be easily adapted .    *",

    "we report on the outputs of a large number of simulations . to run them , we fixed @xmath121 .",
    "the first fact one observes is the following one .",
    "* uniqueness , for any fixed value of @xmath119 , of the asymptotic stationary distribution*. for fixed values of the parameters @xmath109 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , for any fixed value @xmath122 $ ] , an equilibrium of @xmath110 exists , to which all solutions of @xmath110 , whose initial conditions @xmath111 satisfy @xmath112 for all @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath123 tend asymptotically as @xmath124 . in other words , a one - parameter family of asymptotic stationary distributions exists , the parameter being the total income value .",
    "other properties can be established from comparisons between different models of the family under consideration . in previous work ( )",
    "we investigated the effects on the shape of the asymptotic income distribution curve and the economic inequality produced by the adoption of fiscal systems with different spread between the maximum and the minimum tax rates and also produced by the introduction of differently weighted welfare measures .",
    "briefly , the simulations suggested the following properties .",
    "* dependence of the asymptotic stationary distribution on the tax rate difference @xmath125*. the profile of the asymptotic stationary distribution depends on the difference between the maximum and the minimum tax rate : if @xmath125 is enlarged , while all other data are kept unchanged , then an increase of the fraction of individuals belonging to the middle classes ( to the detriment of those in the poorest and richest classes ) can be detected at the asymptotic equilibrium .",
    "* dependence of the asymptotic stationary distribution on differently weighted welfare measures*. the profile of the asymptotic stationary distribution depends on the parameter @xmath109 characterising the welfare measures .",
    "when @xmath109 decreases and all other data are kept unchanged , at the asymptotic equilibrium an increase of the fraction of individuals belonging to the middle classes can be detected ( and , correspondingly , a decrease of those in the poorest and richest classes ) .    in this connection we evaluated for the models under consideration the gini index @xmath126 and the tax revenue @xmath127",
    ", whose definition is recalled next .",
    "let the lorenz curve represent ( on the @xmath128 axis ) the cumulative percentage of the total income of a population earned by the bottom percentage of individuals ( on the @xmath129 axis ) .",
    "the gini index @xmath126 corresponds to the ratio @xmath130 of the area @xmath131 between the line of perfect equality @xmath132 and the lorenz curve and the total area @xmath133 under the line of perfect equality .",
    "it takes values in @xmath134 $ ] , @xmath135 representing complete equality and @xmath102 maximal inequality .",
    "the tax revenue is the total amount of tax collected in the unit time and redistributed as welfare provisions : @xmath136 with @xmath137 denoting the fraction of individuals in the @xmath17-th class at equilibrium .",
    "this paper focuses upon an important socio - economic issue : social mobility .",
    "social mobility gives a measure of the chances individuals have to improve their economic status through education and work .",
    "it is known that a high level of inequality in a society is especially harmful when it is complemented by a diminution of social mobility , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "social mobility has been historically an important component of the `` american dream '' ( and of its emulations ) , thus making the high inequality level present in the us more tolerable . today",
    ", several observers point out a diminution of social mobility , as seen for instance from the growing difficulties that the sons and daughters of the poor and middle classes have to access the best universities and the best paid jobs . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "quantitative empirical surveys show that mobility is negatively correlated with inequality , i.e. more unequal societies also tend to have less mobility .",
    "studying the correlation between economic inequality and mobility is of particular interest because statistical evaluations of the economic mobility of a society are more difficult than measurements of the income distribution .",
    "this is due to the fact that they require to follow the evolution of the individuals income for at least one or two generations .",
    "correspondingly , in micro - to - macro theoretical models of economic exchanges based on kinetic equations , the income distribution depends only on the asymptotic equilibrium solution of the equations , while mobility estimates also involve the detailed structure of the transition probabilities of the model .    in our models",
    "there are no generations and it is impossible to compare the income of one individual with that of his or her parents .",
    "individuals are supposed to live and work indefinitely , or at least for the time it takes for the system to reach its dynamical equilibrium . during this time the income distribution evolves from some initial conditions to a stationary state , in correspondence",
    "to which the number of individuals belonging to a certain class remains constant in time : at equilibrium , the total rate of individuals leaving that class is equal in absolute value to the total rate of individuals arriving from other classes .",
    "this means that in the equations @xmath110 , whose right hand side can now be written in a simplified form in view of @xmath138 , one has @xmath139 .",
    "equivalently , the equilibrium populations are solutions of the nonlinear equations @xmath140}^i(x ) { \\big ) } \\ , x_h x_k   - x_i = 0 \\qquad \\hbox{for } \\",
    "i \\in \\{1 , ... , n\\},\\ ] ] with @xmath43 and @xmath44}^i(x)$ ] as in @xmath64 and @xmath141 .",
    "the equilibrium populations can be obtained numerically as asymptotic solutions of the full evolution equations .",
    "we have evidence from several numerical solutions that the approach to equilibrium is exponential in time , in the sense that the `` cauchy convergence norm '' converges exponentially to zero as @xmath142 ( see @xcite ) .    below we introduce quantitative indicators suitable to define the mobility in our models .",
    "then , we check the correlation of mobility with inequality . to this end , we analyze the dependence of mobility on parameters such as the taxation rates gap and welfare means - testing ; we find interesting relations between the mobility and the inequality indicators .",
    "the mobility evaluated in this paper is always meant at equilibrium , when the rates of the individuals entering and leaving an income class are the same ( but of course differ from class to class ) .",
    "we do not consider long - term trends , characterized by an increase or diminution of the total income of the society . in our models",
    "the social mobility is essentially a short - term mobility , which gives each individual a probability to go up or down the income ladder .",
    "a large value of the mobility should be regarded as positive for the economy , because it acts as a stimulus and as a reward for the individuals who are more capable and hard - working . while in the average",
    "the upward mobility and downward mobility are the same at equilibrium , we can imagine that those who go up are economically stronger than those who go down .",
    "this might be evidenced , in an improved version of the model , by introducing some heterogeneity factors , and so labelling the individuals not only with their income class @xmath17 but possibly also with some `` fitness '' index related to education , number of economic links , etc .    to start with",
    ", we define the probabilities for an individual belonging to the income class @xmath17 , for @xmath143 , to be promoted to the upper class following a direct interaction or an indirect interaction ( i.e. , through welfare provisions ) respectively as @xmath144 and @xmath145 we restrict our attention to all classes but the first and the last one , in order to avoid possible boundary effects . by summing the probabilities @xmath146 and @xmath147",
    "we obtain the total probability @xmath148 for a single individual advancement @xmath149 which is the base for the calculations that follow .",
    "we then define `` averaged '' class probabilities of being promoted to the upper class ( the one - step transition probabilities for the class @xmath17 ) respectively due to direct or indirect interactions as @xmath150 and @xmath151 for @xmath143 .",
    "we have first introduced similar quantities in our paper @xcite , where we computed the ratio between the term due to binary exchanges ( the quadratic part of the evolution equation ) and the term due to tax redistribution ( the cubic part ) .",
    "this ratio gives a measure of the `` liberalism '' of the society .",
    "we found that with equally distributed welfare the ratio stays , quite surprisingly , almost constant when we pass from the middle classes to the rich classes , although one might expect welfare provisions to be irrelevant for the class advancement of the super - rich .",
    "let us now call @xmath152 the sum of the probabilities @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "if we make an histogram of @xmath148 in a typical situation with gini index @xmath155 , we see that it increases with income and attains its largest values in correspondence of the richest classes ( see fig .",
    "@xmath156 ) .",
    "we know , however , that in real world income distributions , the fifth quintile generally includes a consistent share of the classes , since the richest classes are scarcely populated and most of the population concentrates in the low- and middle - income classes .",
    "this also happens in our models provided the initial conditions are such that most of the wealth initially belongs to the low and middle classes .",
    "for instance , in the example with the parameters of fig .",
    "@xmath156 , the histogram of mobility is shown in fig .",
    "so , while some aspects of the mobility of the rich are interesting in principle , because they are related to the formation of the pareto fat tail in the distribution , the value of the mobility of the rich classes does not have a strong influence on the average mobility of all classes .",
    "our main measure of mobility expresses the collective probability of class advancement of all classes from the @xmath158-th to the @xmath159-th one .",
    "indeed , we consider @xmath160 and @xmath161 and take the sum @xmath162 as the parameter which represents the mobility .            now",
    ", we change slightly one of the parameters of the model , in order to increase equality and decrease the gini index .",
    "for instance , we pass from taxation rates @xmath163 to @xmath164 , leaving unchanged the parameters defining the direct exchanges and the welfare redistribution parameter ( here we have @xmath165 , which means uniform welfare distribution ) .",
    "this leads to a gini coefficient @xmath166 , to a variation @xmath167 as in fig .",
    "@xmath168 , and to an average variation @xmath169 .",
    "it is clear from the histogram that the mobility variation for the middle classes is positive , and that it prevails in the average .",
    "the histogram of the individual mobility variations shows an even sharper diminution of the mobility of the rich classes , see fig .",
    "in fact , one could verify that also the percentage mobility variation is always larger for the rich classes , both for @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "a similar behavior is found when the negative variation of the gini index is obtained with a change of the welfare redistribution parameter , as to make it more favorable to the low and middle classes .",
    "several trials of this kind confirm the positive correlation between equality and mobility . in the next section we shall consider variations of the gini index and mobility in correspondence to contemporary variations in tax rates and welfare distribution parameters , which again confirm this positive correlation .              if we compute the values of @xmath126 in dependence on the two variables @xmath174 and @xmath109 , we can identify on a cartesian plane @xmath175 a family of `` level lines of @xmath126 '' corresponding to constant values of @xmath126 .",
    "similarly , we can find in the same plane the level lines of @xmath173 . in principle",
    ", one would expect the two sets of level lines to be distinct . as a matter of fact",
    ", it is impossible to write an explicit functional dependence of @xmath126 and @xmath173 on @xmath176 and @xmath109 , and the definitions of the two quantities are completely different . in particular , @xmath126 depends only on the @xmath177 , while @xmath173 also depends on the encounter frequency rates @xmath178 , which are largely arbitrary .",
    "what is remarkable , however , is that the level lines of @xmath126 and @xmath173 coincide up to ca .",
    "part in @xmath179 , at least in the region of the plane @xmath175 which we have explored through the simulations .",
    "the increments of @xmath126 and @xmath173 are always opposite , so the negative correlation between them is strongly confirmed also in simultaneous dependence on these two variables .",

    "we can base this comparison on the concept of temperature . independently from its exact definition , mobility should be related to the probability that molecules pass to a state of higher energy after interaction with other molecules .",
    "it seems therefore reasonable to assume that mobility increases with absolute temperature . in order to establish a correlation with inequality",
    ", we should then determine how the `` gini index of a gas '' varies with temperature .",
    "for the boltzmann - gibbs exponential distribution , the gini index is independent from the temperature and equal to @xmath191 .",
    "a particular attention is deserved by the @xmath192-generalized distribution introduced by kaniadakis @xcite .",
    "it takes into account relativistic kinematics and is therefore suitable to describe hot gases and plasmas , and at the same time it provides an excellent fit for income distributions both of real world @xcite and of kinetic models @xcite .",
    "the kanidakis distribution has a gini index @xmath126 that increases with temperature . the analytical formula which gives @xmath126 as a function of the parameters @xmath193 and @xmath192 of the distribution contains four gamma - functions and",

    "@xmath197 ) .",
    "when the kaniadakis distribution is applied to a relativistic gas , @xmath192 is related to the gas parameters by @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the atomic or molecular mass , @xmath200 the speed of light , @xmath201 the boltzmann constant and @xmath202 the absolute temperature @xcite .",
    "( [ kappa - t ] ) shows that @xmath192 increases when @xmath202 increases .",
    "it follows that a higher temperature leads to higher @xmath126 .",
    "this amounts , for the gas , to a negative correlation between equality and mobility , which disagrees with the results of empirical economic studies and of our kinetic model .",
    "this comparison points to one of the many qualitative differences between physical and economical interactions . in physical systems",
    "it happens quite often that larger gradients in density , pressure , etc .",
    "cause a quicker dynamical evolution , so that , in some sense , `` greater inequality causes greater mobility '' . in economy this `` stimulus effect '' has been theorized to work for certain growth phases , see @xcite and references therein , but is apparently not the dominant factor at equilibrium . instead",
    ", mobility is positively related to equality , at least as an average over all income classes .",

    "some features of the emerging income distribution curves are discussed . in particular , we compare models with fiscal systems characterized by a different spread between the minimum and the maximum tax rate and models in which the welfare provision is weighted differently for different income classes .",
    "the main contribution of the paper is represented , in our opinion , by the introduction of a measure of social mobility .",
    "this is possible due to the structure of the equations , which involve several transition probabilities for the passage from an income class to others .",
    "together with the gini index , this measure serves as a tool to investigate the correlation between economic inequality and social mobility .",
    "the correlation turns out to be clearly negative : a lower mobility corresponds to a higher inequality .",
    "this is in agreement with what is observed in real world situations .",
