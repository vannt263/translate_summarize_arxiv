    "graphane ( ga ) , a two dimensional covalently bonded hydrocarbon , was first predicted from ab - initio calculation by sluiter  _ et al _  @xcite and recently rediscovered  @xcite . in a recent experiment elias  _",
    "@xcite demonstrated the fabrication of ga from a graphene ( ge ) membrane through hydrogenation which was found to be reversible .",
    "density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations employing different force fields were carried out to study the structural and electronic properties of both ga and ge  @xcite .",
    "hydrogen ( h ) atoms are chemically bound to the carbon ( c ) atoms on alternating sides of the membrane ( chair like conformer ) which causes a local buckling of the membrane .",
    "such deformations for small membrane sizes ( @xmath4 ) have been recently reported  @xcite . in the early stages of the hydrogenation process",
    ", membrane shrinking and extensive membrane corrugations occur due to the formation of a significant percentage of uncorrelated h frustrated domains  @xcite .",
    "the morphology of perfect ga , and its comparison with a perfect ge membrane , has not yet been investigated for large samples .",
    "ab - initio calculations are restricted to small unit cells and therefore we will use atomistic simulations to show the main differences between the morphology of a large sample of ga and ge .",
    "our atomistic simulations are based on the second generation of brenner potential  @xcite ( rebo ) which includes the interaction with third nearest neighbors via a bond - order term that is associated with the dihedral angles .",
    "therefore , such a potential is suitable for various atomistic simulation purposes including the calculations the lattice thermal properties ( phonon dispersion  @xcite , elastic moduli  @xcite , thermal conductivity  @xcite , etc ) of carbon nanotubes , graphene and hydrocarbons .",
    "nevertheless , there are a few shortcomings in rebo potential which are important when modeling processes involving energetic atomic collisions ( because both morse - type terms approach finite values at very small atomic distance ) , and the neglect of a separate @xmath5 bond contribution which leads to the overbinding of radicals our study is insensitive for these shortcomings ) .",
    "of course , the electronic properties of ge and ga and the thermodynamical properties at low temperatures ( because of the e.g. quantum zero energy ) are beyond rebo s ability . in those situations ab - initio calculations , particularly those based on density functional theory ( dft ) , are extremely useful .",
    "ab - initio molecular dynamics simulation ( e.g. car - parrinello molecular dynamics  @xcite ) is a highly appreciated theory which eliminates the force - fields based restrictions , but its main disadvantage is that it is only applicable for small size systems ( typically @xmath6 500 atoms ) .    here",
    "we study relatively large systems and consider thermal and structural properties of ge and ga above 50k and show that for a ga sample with size 183  @xmath7185    containing 22400 atoms , the roughness , the induced ripples structure and the total energies are very different from a ge membrane .",
    "it has been shown that the ripples in ge strongly affect its thermo - electronic properties  @xcite .",
    "temperature effects are studied and we found that the thermal contraction of a suspended ga is larger than the one for ge .",
    "moreover the calculated roughness exponent indicates that ga is more rough than ge even at room temperature . from our simulations",
    ", we predict that the ripples in ga affect its thermo - electronic properties much more than for ge .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we introduce the atomistic model and the simulation method .",
    "sectioniii contains our main results for both graphene and graphane .",
    "results for thermal contraction , roughness and heat capacity for different temperatures are presented and compared to available experimental results . in sec.iv",
    "we conclude the paper .",
    "classical atomistic molecular dynamics simulation ( md ) is employed to simulate large flakes of ge and ga at various temperatures .",
    "the second generation of brenner s bond - order potential is employed which is able to describe covalent sp@xmath8 bond breaking and the formation of associated changes in atomic hybridization within a classical potential  @xcite .",
    "the brenner potential ( rebo ) terms were taken as @xmath9 $ ] , where @xmath10 is the average binding energy , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the repulsive and attractive term , respectively , where @xmath13 is the distance between atoms _",
    "j_. @xmath14 is called the bond order factor which includes all many - body effects .",
    "@xmath14 depends on the local environment of the bond i.e. the bond and torsional angles , the bond lengths and the atomic coordination in the vicinity of the bond .",
    "this feature allows the brenner potential to predict correctly the configurations and energies for many different hydrocarbon structures and the correct hybridization .",
    "initially the coordinates of all carbon atoms in ga ( ge ) are put in a flat surface of a honey comb lattice with nearest neighbor distance equal to @xmath15  nm ( 0.142  nm ) .",
    "the hydrogen atoms are alternatively put on top and bottom of the carbons , i.e. @xmath16 with @xmath17 ( chair like model for ga  @xcite , see the inset in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figmodel ] ) . to make sure that the second generation of the brenner potential gives the correct force field for our thermo - mechanical studies of the ga sheet , we performed extra simulations where we started with a non optimum bond length of @xmath18 nm . already after only a few time steps the correct optimum ga lattice spacing , i.e. @xmath190.153  nm ,",
    "was found confirming the ability of the used potential for ga simulations .",
    "the considered systems are square sheets with dimensions 183  @xmath7185    for ga and 170  @xmath7170    for ge , in @xmath20 and @xmath21- directions where we considered both armchair and zigzag edges .",
    "the number of atoms in ga ( ge ) is @xmath22 ( @xmath23/2 ) .",
    "we simulated the system at non - zero temperatures ( above 50k ) by employing a nose - hoover thermostat . in order to mimic the experimental set - up we prevent motion along the @xmath24-direction at the ends of the system along @xmath20 .",
    "this is realized in practice by fixing a row of atoms at both longitudinal sides .",
    "this supported boundary condition prevents the drift ( of the ends of the sheet ) in the @xmath24-direction .",
    "motion in the @xmath3 plane is allowed which allows the system to relax and to exhibit lattice contraction / expansion .    before starting the sampling ,",
    "we let the system to find its true size and temperature during the first 5ps . during this process",
    "ga and ge change their longitudinal length so that we always observe lattice contraction implying that ga and ge shrink through surface corrugation ( i.e. creating ripples )  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figmodel ] shows two snap - shots of ga and ge relaxed at 700 k. the c - h bonds ( except at the boundaries ) are almost parallel which is a consequence of lateral h - h repulsion .",
    "after equilibrating , we start to record the longitudinal size ( in @xmath3 plane along @xmath20-axis ) of the system for 2ps . averaging over the lengths during the sampling process",
    "gives the average length of the system , i.e. @xmath25 , at the given temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig1](a ) shows the thermal contraction coefficient , i.e. @xmath26 , versus temperature , where @xmath27  ( @xmath28 )  is the initial length of ga ( ge ) ( for a flat sheet at @xmath29=0k ) and @xmath30 . as we see @xmath31 increases with temperature and is always negative in the studied temperature range . surprisingly ga has a larger contraction with temperature than ge .",
    "these curves are fitted to @xmath32 where @xmath33=22@xmath15@xmath710@xmath34k@xmath35 , 4@xmath11@xmath710@xmath34k@xmath35 and @xmath36=-877.10@xmath129 and -298.8@xmath16 for ga and ge , respectively ( solid curves in fig .",
    "2(a ) ) .    at present",
    "a few studies exist on the negative thermal expansion coefficient ( tec ) of ge , but none are available for ga .",
    "the actual values of the tecs for ge differ from one study to the other depending on e.g. the size and the boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "mounet and marzari  @xcite presented a study of the thermodynamical and structural properties of carbon based structures ( graphite , diamond and ge ) using gga - dft calculations . in order to calculate the finite temperature thermal expansion and heat capacity ,",
    "a quasi harmonic approximation ( qha ) was employed  @xcite . using the dft results for the phonon dispersion relation and minimizing the qha free energy with respect to the lattice parameter ( @xmath37 ) , they found the linear thermal expansion of the lattice parameter -@xmath38- for graphite , ge and diamond .",
    "the linear thermal expansion for the lattice parameter of ge , @xmath39 where @xmath40 , was found to be negative and about @xmath41 at room temperature .",
    "qha+gga includes only weakly anharmonicity but it includes quantum effects and zero point energy .",
    "the strong anharmonic coupling of the bending and stretching modes in ge , which are essential for the ge stability , are accurately described by classical empirical potentials at non - zero temperatures  @xcite . in our study",
    "the negative thermal contraction is reported for the length -@xmath42- of ga and ge samples .",
    "since ripples appear in ge and ga membranes , we expect a contraction of the length of the systems .",
    "@xmath43 is not directly related to @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , @xmath45 is the variation of the measured length along @xmath20-direction while @xmath46 is the variation of the lattice parameter not necessarily in the @xmath3 plane . therefore our results for the contraction of the ge s length are not directly related to those of qha+gga for contraction of the lattice parameter .    in a recent experiment  @xcite the morphology of different graphene membranes ( micron size membranes ) suspended across trenches on si",
    "/ sio@xmath47 substrates were investigated using afm and stm .",
    "tecs were found to be about @xmath48 at room temperature .",
    "with increasing temperature the measured tecs approaches zero nonlinearly . here , we find a similar contraction in the longitudinal size ( e.g. @xmath49 at @xmath29=300k for ge ) which approaches zero with increasing temperature but which is an order of magnitude larger . to compute the thermal contraction we calculated the longitudinal size ( not the arc length as done in the experiment  @xcite ) .",
    "there are important differences between our approach and those from the above mentioned experiment .",
    "first , we use the initial length ( as a reference for the length ) of our samples as the length of the sheet at zero temperature .",
    "second , the sample size is different .",
    "third , there is no substrate in our study which could reduce the contraction .",
    "our suspended sample is free to drift in the @xmath3 plane while in the experiment , the substrate prevents free drift in the @xmath3 plane in addition to movement along the @xmath24-direction which causes a lower contraction . notice that @xmath50 .",
    "we found that in thermal equilibrium and under supported boundary conditions , the equilibrium size of ge is longer than ga",
    ". therefore , the ga surface is much more corrugated than ge .",
    "the larger contraction of ga is due to the larger amplitude of the ripples as compared to ge .",
    "the reason is that hydrogen atoms which are below and above the sheet attract or repel the carbon atoms and push them in different directions , ( i.e. random thermal fluctuations of the hydrogens at finite temperature ) .",
    "therefore , we expect an increasing randomness of the ga sheet and expect the formation of different patterns of ripples in a ga sheet and a larger corrugation .",
    "the thickness of ga is larger than ge , hence one expects for such a thicker material , ordinary positive thermal expansion ( or at least smaller thermal contraction with respect to ge ) .",
    "however , we found negative thermal contraction for ga which is larger than the one for ge .",
    "it is interesting to note that above 1500k we observe a buckling of ga .",
    "figure  [ fig2000 ] shows a snap shot of a buckled ga sheet at 2000k . a similar buckling",
    "was observed in experiments on suspended ge  @xcite and in a circular ge sheet subjected to radial strain  @xcite .",
    "therefore , increasing temperature induces larger axial strains in ga .",
    "figure  [ fig1](b ) shows the average square root out of plane deviation of the carbon atoms ( i.e. static roughness , i.e. @xmath51 ) versus time for three typical temperatures . for long times",
    "@xmath52 fluctuates around 0.2  for ge and 1.3   for ga which is 6.5 times larger .",
    "figure  [ fig1](c ) shows the variation of @xmath53 ( where average is over lateral size of the system ) and @xmath54 ( where average is over longitudinal size of the system ) for ge and ga at @xmath29=700k .",
    "because of the specific boundary condition the ripples appear in the @xmath20-direction , while in the @xmath21-direction the fluctuations are much smaller and for ge they are almost zero .",
    "this leads to a larger randomness in ga which relates to a less stiff material as compared to ge  @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2d ] which shows the corresponding contour plot for ga and ge at @xmath29=300k and 700k .",
    "notice the difference in scale for the amplitude .",
    "for example for ga at 700k the amplitude of the ripples are in the [ -4,4]  range and [ -2,2]  for ge . in the lateral boundaries we see larger amplitude variations .",
    "the free boundaries in ge exhibit larger free vibrations than ga .",
    "this can also be inferred from the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) . notice that the typical wave lengths ( @xmath55 ) for the ripples in ga are very different as compared to the one of ge .",
    "figure  [ figfourier ] shows the amplitude of the fourier transform of @xmath56 , @xmath57 ( with an ensemble average taken over 60 samples ) , for ga and ge as function of the wave length along the @xmath20-direction ( taken in the middle of the system around @xmath21=0 ) , @xmath58 for two different temperatures .",
    "independent of temperature , the ripples in ga span a wider range of wave lengths , for example they span length scales in the ( 30 - 125)  and ( 25 - 140)  ranges , for @xmath59k and @xmath60k , respectively .",
