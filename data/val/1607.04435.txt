    "notwithstanding the important role that selection has traditionally played in evolutionary theory , evolution is not possible if selection has not variation to act upon .",
    "thus mutations widely understood as imperfect replications are the fuel to evolutionary dynamics .",
    "but mutations act at the level of the _ genotype _ whereas selection acts at the level of the _ phenotype _ the physical manifestation of the genotype , and the translation from one to the other the so - called genotype - phenotype ( gp ) map is far from trivial  @xcite .",
    "most mutations have no effect on the phenotype ( they are neutral ) , whereas occasionally a mutation has a dramatic ( mostly deleterious but sometimes benefitial ) phenotypic effect .",
    "thus , evolutionary dynamics is critically affected by the structure of the gp map  @xcite .",
    "understanding the gp map is a challenge for the evolutionary community , overall because addressing this problem in real systems is of an overwhelming complexity . accordingly , several simplified models have been studied to gain insights into this difficult issue  @xcite .",
    "computationally tractable models incorporate only a few levels among those involved in an actual gp map . they have considered protein folding  @xcite or protein aggregation  @xcite at basic molecular levels , and gene - regulatory  @xcite or metabolic  @xcite networks at higher functional levels .",
    "recent models encompass different levels at the same time  @xcite : in contrast with simple sequence - structure gp maps , the inclusion of different levels from genotype to phenotype permits the emergence of properties such as environment - dependent molecular function .",
    "pioneer among those models was the folding of sequences of rna into their secondary structure taken as a proxy for function  @xcite , which likely represents the most studied gp map to date .",
    "folding is driven by the formation of hydrogen bonds betwen cg , au , and gu base pairs , and the secondary structure of the molecule is determined by its minimum free - energy configuration . despite its apparent simplicity and the inherent impossibility to capture all features of natural gp relationships , rna sequence - to - secondary structure maps have properties shared by all gp maps studied to date , as the relationship between the number of genotypes yielding the same phenotype and the neutrality of the latter  @xcite .",
    "an important question in characterising this gp map is how many different secondary structures an rna molecule @xmath0 base pairs long can form .",
    "that problem was solved long ago , with the help of recurrence equations and subsequent generating functions , for several variants of the model @xcite .",
    "asymptotic expressions were provided when @xmath0 is large under different constraints imposed to the secondary structure such as having a minimum number of unpaired nucleotides in hairpin loops or stems of a minimal given length . another relevant question , which represents a step forward in the relation between structure and function , is how many secondary structures present particular structural moieties  @xcite .",
    "a prominent example is that of short sequences with hairpin loops , which have been shown to act as ribozymes with ligase catalytic activity under general conditions  @xcite . this undemanding phenotype - to - function map could have been essential in the emergence of rna molecules with complex activity in a prebiotic rna world  @xcite .",
    "the number of different structural motifs ( stems and hairpin loops among others ) in the limit of @xmath0 large was shown to be normally distributed  @xcite .",
    "symbolic methods introduced in modern combinatorics  @xcite greatly simplified the solution of that problem . in his exhaustive work",
    "@xcite , reidys tackled in depth the properties of rna folded structures bearing a type of tertiary interactions known as pseudoknots .",
    "the functional form of the number of structures with pseudoknots as a function of sequence length @xmath0 is of the general form @xmath4 , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 their values depending on restrictions put on the folded structure .",
    "an important constraint is the complexity of pseudoknots , which conditions the mathematical description of the problem . specifically , folded rna molecules are first reduced to a core skeleton containing information only on the pseudoknot architecture of the fold .",
    "generating functions for the number of possible alternative core structures with the previous architecture are derived and , subsequently , full folds are recovered by reintroducing stems and unpaired nucleotides in all possible compatible positions through composition of suitably defined generating functions .",
    "eventually , the total number of structures with the required pseudoknot properties and other possible structural constraints is obtained .",
    "further details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "this tricky procedure for structures with pseudoknots is not necessary in the case of plain secondary structures , as we show here .",
    "application of symbolic combinatorics to the latter case serves as an introduction to the calculation of the number of secondary structures for circular rna sequences . as will be shown , particular properties of circular rna demand the introduction of combinatorial techniques beyond those needed to enumerate open rna sequences with or without pseudoknots .",
    "circular rnas form covalently closed continuous loops with specific properties that distinguish them from linear rnas . among others ,",
    "circular rnas are non - coding , and have higher resistance to exonuclease - mediated degradation and higher structural stability .",
    "viroids , first described half a century ago  @xcite , are a relevant example of circular rna . these pathogenic , naked rna molecules of a few hundred nucleotides in length infect plants , occasionally causing strong symptoms .",
    "the mechanisms implied in cell entry , replication and propagation are still partly unknown .",
    "viroids present secondary structures with highly conserved regions that fall within two structural classes : rod - like and branched folds .",
    "the secondary structure of viroids plays an essential role in chemical function  @xcite and acts as a buffer to control the structural effect of point mutations  @xcite .",
    "circular rnas encoded in animal genomes , on the other hand , are currently a hot topic  @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent studies report a previously unsuspected abundance of circular rnas , which awakes the hunch that they must play main functional roles in the cell  @xcite . while some of those circular rnas have gene regulatory activity",
    ", the function performed by thousand of others is as yet unknown  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a theoretical understanding of the structural diversity of secondary structures of circular rnas appears as a timely endeavour , further considering that closed rna sequences have folding restrictions different from those of their linear counterparts . as we demonstrate here , their particular properties entail a comparatively lower number of secondary structures and lead to different asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : brief ] briefly introduces those aspects of the symbolic method  @xcite relevant for our study . in section  [ sec : rna ] we derive the generating function for the number of secondary structures with stems of length at least @xmath7 and hairpins with at least @xmath8 unpaired nucleotides , and recover the known expressions in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "section  [ sec : basepairs ] contains the calculation of the frequency of structures with a given number of base pairs and is followed by the simultaneous count of the number of hairpins in section  [ sec:2elements ] .",
    "the method extends to multivariate analysis suitable for counting combinatorial structures with any number of constraints .",
    "section  [ sec : rings ] introduces the main novelty of this work , that is , the enumeration of secondary structures in circular rnas , followed by a derivation of the distributions of base pairs and hairpins as a function of @xmath0 in section  [ sec : elementsrings ] .",
    "we close with a brief discussion .",
    "a full account of symbolic methods in combinatorics can be found in part a of ref .",
    "however , for the sake of self - containedness , we provide a very brief account in this section .",
    "readers familiar with this method can safely skip this section .    a combinatorial class @xmath9 will be a set of elements on which a _ size _ function @xmath10 is defined .",
    "the counting problem is to obtain @xmath11 , the number of elements @xmath12 such that @xmath13 .",
    "a related problem is to obtain the generating function @xmath14 ( @xmath0 runs on all possible sizes ) whose coefficients yield the sequence @xmath15 .",
    "the second writing for @xmath16 turns out to be very useful when thinking about these problems , because it means that every element of @xmath9 contributes to the sum defining @xmath16 with as many factors @xmath17 as its size .",
    "if a second function is defined on the elements of @xmath9 , namely @xmath18 ( representing any other feature of @xmath2 ) , we can introduce the bivariate generating function @xmath19 clearly @xmath20 counts the number of elements in @xmath9 of size @xmath0 and feature value @xmath21 , and the second writing can be interpreted as every element @xmath12 adding to the generating function besides the factor @xmath22 as many factors @xmath23 as the value of the feature .",
    "we can combine combinatorial classes to obtain new combinatorial classes .",
    "we first have the combinatorial product @xmath24 , which is the set made of the ` composite objects ' @xmath25 , where @xmath12 and @xmath26 ( notice that @xmath25 and @xmath27 are in general different objects ) .",
    "the size of the set @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 ( the size of the composite object is the sum of the sizes of the components ) .",
    "accordingly , @xmath30    another operation is the combinatorial sum , @xmath31 , also referred to as disjoint union .",
    "@xmath28 is the union of @xmath9 and @xmath32 provided the elements of these two sets are distinguishable ( in other words , it is as if we paint the elements of these two sets with two different colors and then make the union of them both ) .",
    "therefore @xmath33 is either an element of @xmath9 or an element of @xmath32 and inherits the corresponding size .",
    "hence , @xmath34    there are further more complex operations with combinatorial classes .",
    "thus @xmath35 where @xmath36 , the class made of the _ null _ element alone ( @xmath37 ) , is referred to as the _ sequence _ of @xmath9 , i.e. , the combinatorial class made of the null element , plus all elements of @xmath9 , plus all pairs of elements of @xmath9 , and so on . by applying the transformation rules for the sum and the product @xmath38    sequences",
    "can be constrained to have composite elements just of certain specific compositions .",
    "for instance , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 times ) is restricted to sequences made of exactly @xmath40 elements of @xmath9 its generating function being @xmath41 .",
    "likewise @xmath42 define sequences containg at least @xmath40 and less than @xmath40 elements of @xmath9 respectively .",
    "then @xmath43 are their corresponding generating functions .",
    "other interesting operations with combinatorial classes are powersets ( @xmath44 ) , multisets ( @xmath45 ) , and cycles ( @xmath46 ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath47 is the class whose members are made of subsets of elements of @xmath9 .",
    "thus @xmath48 and therefore @xmath49 ( the last step follows by writing the product as the exponential of a sum of logarithms and then taylor - expanding those logarithms . )    @xmath50 is the class whose members are made of sequences of arbitrary length of elements of @xmath9 .",
    "thus @xmath51 and therefore @xmath52    @xmath53 is the class whose members are made of circular sequences of arbitrary length of elements of @xmath9 .",
    "the derivation of the generating function of @xmath54 is more involved ( * ? ? ?",

    "there are many ways to obtain its corresponding generating function , but perhaps the easiest is to first introduce @xmath66 , the class of pairs of identical elements of @xmath9 .",
    "its corresponding generating function is @xmath67 because it contains one element per element of @xmath9 , but its size is double .",

    "some bases are complementary and can pair up forming a hydrogen bond , some others are not and remain unbound .",

    "a description of these structures along with an illustration of them can be found in @xcite .",
    "determining the specific secondary structure of an rna molecule is a complex problem that requires not only a careful energetic minimisation , but also considerations on the environmental conditions and folding kinetics , among others  @xcite .",
    "however , some folding constraints arise as a consequence of local conditions for energetic stability . among them , two are especially important and were taken into account in early calculations of the number of realistic rna secondary structures  @xcite . here",
    "we use two general assumptions in agreement with those restrictions : ( 1 ) no stem can contain less than @xmath7 pairs , and ( 2 ) no hairpin loop can contain less than @xmath8 bases .",
    "we will divide our counting problem in two steps .",
    "first , we will count those foldings starting with a stem as the one illustrated in figure  [ fig : rnafold](a ) .",
