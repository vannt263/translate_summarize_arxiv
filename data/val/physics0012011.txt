    "two postulates were essential for einstein s original axiomatic derivation  @xcite of the lorentz transformation ( lt ) : ( i ) the special relativity principle and ( ii ) the hypothesis of the constancy of the velocity of light in all inertial frames ( einstein s second postulate ) .",
    "the special relativity principle , which states that :    * ` the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames ' *    had long been known to be respected by newton s laws of mechanics at the time einstein s paper was written .",
    "galileo had already stated the principle in 1588 in his ` dialogues concerning two new sciences ' .",
    "the title of einstein s paper  @xcite ` on the electrodynamics of moving bodies ' and the special role of light in his second postulate seem to link special relativity closely to classical electrodynamics .",
    "indeed , the lt was discovered as the transformation that demonstrates that maxwell s equations may be written in the same way in any inertial frame , and so manifestly respect the special relativity principle .",
    "the same close connection between special relativity and classical electrodynamics is retained in virtually all text - book treatments of the subject , obscuring the essentially geometrical and kinematical nature of special relativistic effects .",
    "the latter actually transcend the dynamics of any particular physical system .",
    "it was realised , shortly after the space - time geometrical nature of the lt was pointed out by minkowski  @xcite , that the domain of applicability of the lt extends beyond the classical electrodynamics considered by einstein , and that , in fact , einstein s second postulate is not necessary for its derivation  @xcite .",
    "there is now a vast literature devoted to derivations of the lt that do not require the second postulate  @xcite .    in a recent paper by the present author  @xcite",
    ", the question of the minimum number of postulates , in addition to the special relativity principle , necessary to derive the lt was addressed .",
    "the aim of the present paper is somewhat different .",
    "the special relativity principle itself is re - stated in a simple mathematical form which , as will be shown below , has both kinematical and dynamical applications .",
    "the new statement is a symmetry condition relating space and time , which , it is conjectured , is respected by the mathematical equations that decscribe all physical laws  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry condition is first used , together with the postulate of the homogeneity of space , to derive the lt .",
    "it is then shown that the kinematical special relativity principle ( ksrp ) is a necessary _ consequence _ of the lt .",
    "the ksrp , which describes the reciprocal nature of similar space time measurements made in two different inertial frames  @xcite , states that :    * ` reciprocal space - time measurements of similar measuring rods and clocks at rest in two different inertial frames @xmath0 , @xmath1 by observers at rest in @xmath1 , @xmath0 respectively , yield identical results ' *    there is no reference here to any physical law",
    ". only space - time events that may constitute the raw material of any observation of a physical process are considered . in the previous literature",
    "the ksrp ( or some equivalent condition applied to a gedankenexperiment  @xcite ) has been been used as a necessary postulate to derive the lt .",
    "the symmetry condition that restates the special relativity principle is :    * * ` the equations describing the laws of physics are invariant with respect to the exchange of space and time coordinates , or , more generally , to the exchange of the spatial and temporal components of four vectors . '",
    "*    a corollary is :    * * ` predictions of physical theories do not depend on the metric sign convention ( space - like or time - like ) used to define four - vector scalar products . '",
    "*    a proof of this corollary is presented in section 4 below .",
    "as will become clear during the following discussion , the operation of space - time exchange ( @xmath2 ) reveals an invariance property of pairs of physical equations , which are found to map into each other under @xmath2 .",
    "the examples of this discussed below are : the lorentz transformation equations of space and time , the maxwell equations describing electrostatics ( gauss law ) and electrodynamics ( ampre s law ) , and those describing magnetostatics ( gauss law ) and magnetodynamics ( the faraday - lenz law ) .",
    "it will be demonstrated that each of these three pairs of equations map into each other under @xmath2 , and so are invariants of the @xmath2 operator . in the case of the lt equations , imposing @xmath2 symmetry is sufficient to derive them from a general form of the space transformation equation that respects the classical limit .",
    "the expression : ` the equations describing the laws of physics ' in ( i ) should then be understood as including _ both equations _ of each @xmath2 invariant pair .",
    "for example , the gauss equation of electrostatics , considered as an independent physical law , clearly does not respect ( i ) .    for dimensional reasons , the definition of the exchange operation referred to in ( i ) requires the time coordinate to be multiplied by a universal parameter @xmath3 with the dimensions of velocity .",
    "the new time coordinate with dimension@xmath4 $ ] : @xmath5 may be called the ` causality radius '  @xcite to distinguish it from the cartesian spatial coordinate @xmath6 or the invariant interval @xmath7 . since space is three dimensional and time is one dimensional , there is a certain ambiguity in the definition of the exchange operation in ( i ) .",
    "depending on the case under discussion , the space coordinate may be either the magnitude of the spatial vector @xmath8 , or a cartesian component @xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 .",
    "for any physical problem with a preferred spatial direction ( which is the case for the lt ) , then , by a suitable choice of coordinate system ,",
    "the identification @xmath12 , @xmath13 is always possible .",
    "the exchange operation in ( i ) is then simply @xmath14 .",
    "formally , the exchange operation is defined by the equations : @xmath15 where @xmath2 denotes the space time exchange operator .",
    "as shown below , for problems where there is no preferred direction , but rather spatial symmetry , it may also be useful to define three exchange operators : @xmath16 with associated operations @xmath17 analagous to @xmath18 in eqns.(1.2)-(1.4 ) .",
    "the operations in eqns.(1.2 ) to ( 1.5 ) may also be generalised to the case of an arbitary 4-vector with temporal and spatial components @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .    to clarify the meaning of the @xmath2 operation ,",
    "it is of interest to compare it with a different operator acting on space and time coordinates that may be called ` space - time coordinate permutation ' ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "consider an equation of the form : @xmath22 the @xmath2 conjugate equation is : @xmath23 this equation is different from ( 1.6 ) because @xmath24 and @xmath9 have different physical meanings . in the @xmath21 operation",
    "however , the _ values _ of the space and time coordinates are interchanged , but no new equation is generated .",
    "if @xmath25 and @xmath26 in eqn.(1.6 ) then the @xmath21 operation applied to the latter yields : @xmath27 this equation is identical in form to ( 1.6 ) ; only its parameters have different values .",
    "the physical meaning of the universal parameter @xmath3 , and its relation to the velocity of light , @xmath28 , is discussed in the following section , after the derivation of the lt .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the following section the lt is derived . in section 3 ,",
    "the lt is used to derive the ksrp .",
    "the space time exchange properties of 4-vectors and the related symmetries in minkowski space are discussed in section 4 . in section 5 the space - time exchange symmetries of maxwell s equations are used to derive electrodynamics ( ampre s law ) and magnetodynamics ( the faraday - lenz law ) from the gauss laws of electrostatics and magnetostatics respectively .",
    "a summary is given in section 6 .",
    "consider two inertial frames @xmath0,@xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 moves along the common @xmath29 axis of orthogonal cartesian coordinate systems in @xmath0,@xmath1 with velocity @xmath30 relative to @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath31 axes are also parallel . at time",
    "@xmath32 the origins of @xmath0 and @xmath1 coincide .",
    "in general the transformation equation between the coordinate @xmath6 in @xmath0 of a fixed point on the @xmath33 axis and the coordinate @xmath34 of the same point referred to the frame @xmath1 is : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath3 is the universal constant introduced in eqn.(1.1 ) .",
    "differentiating eqn.(2.1 ) with respect to @xmath24 , for fixed @xmath34 , gives : @xmath37 since @xmath38 the function @xmath39 must satisfy the partial differential equation : @xmath40 a sufficient condition for @xmath39 to be a solution of eqn.(2.3 ) is that it is a function of @xmath41 .",
    "assuming also @xmath39 is a differentiable function , it may be expanded in a taylor series : @xmath42 requiring either spatial homogeneity  @xcite , or that the lt is a unique , single valued , function of its arguments  @xcite , requires eqn.(2.4 ) to be linear , i.e. @xmath43 so that @xmath44 spatial homogeneity implies that eqn(2.5 ) is invariant when all spatial coordinates are scaled by any constant factor @xmath45 . noting that : @xmath46 and choosing @xmath47 gives : @xmath48 hence ,",
    "eqn.(2.5 ) is invariant provided that @xmath49 i.e. @xmath50 is an even function of @xmath51 .    applying the space time exchange operations",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 to eqn.(2.5 ) gives @xmath54 the transformation inverse to ( 2.9 ) may , in general , be written as : @xmath55 the same inverse transformation may also be derived by eliminating @xmath6 between eqns.(2.5 ) and ( 2.9 ) and re - arranging : @xmath56 eqns(2.10),(2.11 ) are consistent provided that : @xmath57 and @xmath58 eqns.(2.8),(2.12 ) and ( 2.13 ) then give  @xcite : @xmath59 eqns.(2.5),(2.9 ) with @xmath60 given by ( 2.14 ) are the lt equations for space - time points along the common @xmath29 axis of the frames @xmath0,@xmath1 .",
    "they have been derived here solely from the symmetry condition ( i ) and the assumption of spatial homogeneity , without any reference to the principle of special relativity .",
    "the physical meaning of the universal parameter @xmath3 becomes clear when the kinematical consequences of the lt for physical objects are worked out in detail .",
    "this is done , for example , in reference [ 6 ] , where it is shown that the velocity of any massive physical object approaches @xmath3 in any inertial frame in which its energy is much greater than its rest mass .",
    "the identification of @xmath3 with the velocity of light , @xmath28 , then follows  @xcite if it is assumed that light consists of massless ( or almost massless ) particles , the light quanta discovered by einstein in his analysis of the photoelectric effect  @xcite . that @xmath3 is the limiting velocity for the applicability of the lt equations is , however , already evident from eqn.(2.14 ) . if @xmath50 is real then @xmath61 , that is @xmath62 .",
    "the lt equations ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.9 ) and their inverses , written in terms of @xmath63 are : @xmath64 consider now observers , at rest in the frames @xmath0,@xmath1 , equipped with identical measuring rods and clocks .",
    "the observer in @xmath1 places a rod , of length @xmath65 , along the common @xmath29 axis .",
    "the coordinates in @xmath1 of the ends of the rod are @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "if the observer in @xmath0 measures , at time @xmath68 in his own frame , the ends of the rod to be at @xmath69 then , according to eqn(3.1 ) : @xmath70 denoting by @xmath71 the apparent length of the rod , as observed from @xmath0 at time @xmath68 , eqns.(3.5),(3.6 ) give @xmath72 suppose that the observer in @xmath1 now makes reciprocal measurements @xmath66 of the ends of a similar rod , at rest in @xmath0 , at time @xmath73 . in @xmath0",
    "the ends of the rod are at the points @xmath74 , where @xmath75 . using eqn.(3.3 ) @xmath76 and , corresponding to ( 3.7 )",
    ", there is the relation : @xmath77 hence , from eqns.(3.7),(3.10 ) @xmath78 so that reciprocal length measurements yield identical results .",
    "consider now a clock at rest in @xmath1 at @xmath79 .",
    "this clock is synchronized with a similar clock in @xmath0 at @xmath32 , when the spatial coordinate systems in @xmath0 and @xmath1 coincide .",
    "suppose that the observer at rest in @xmath0 notes the time @xmath68 recorded by his own clock , when the moving clock records the time @xmath80 .",
    "at this time , the clock which is moving along the common @xmath29 axis with velocity @xmath30 will be situated at @xmath81 . with the definition @xmath82 , and using eqn.(3.2 ) : @xmath83 if the observer at rest in @xmath1 makes a reciprocal measurement of the clock at rest in @xmath0 , which is seen to be at @xmath84 when it shows the time @xmath80 , then according to eqn.(3.4 ) with @xmath85 : @xmath86 eqns.(3.12),(3.13 ) give @xmath87 eqns.(3.11),(3.14 ) prove the kinematical special relativity principle as stated above .",
    "it is a necessary consequence of the lt .",
    "the lt was derived above for space time points lying along the common @xmath29 axis , so that @xmath88 . however",
    ", this restriction is not necessary . in the case that @xmath89 then @xmath6 and @xmath34 in eqn.(2.5 ) may be replaced by @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively , where the 1-axis is chosen parallel to @xmath92 .",
    "the proof proceeds as before with the space time exchange operation defined as in eqns.(1.2)-(1.4 ) .",
    "the additional transformation equations : @xmath93 follow from spatial isotropy  @xcite .    in the above derivation of the lt , application of the @xmath2 operator generates the lt of time from that of space .",
    "it is the pair of equations that is invariant with respect to the @xmath2 operation . alternatively , as shown below , by a suitable change of variables , equivalent equations may be defined that are manifestly invariant under the @xmath2 operation .",
    "the 4-vector velocity @xmath94 and the energy - momentum 4-vector @xmath95 are defined in terms of the space - time 4-vector  @xcite : @xmath96 by the equations : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the newtonian mass of the physical object and @xmath80 is its proper time , i.e. the time in a reference frame in which the object is at rest . since @xmath80 is a lorentz invariant quantity , the 4-vectors @xmath99 have identical lt properties to x. the properties of @xmath99 under the @xmath2 operation follow directly from eqns.(1.2),(1.3 ) and the definitions ( 4.4 ) and ( 4.5 ) .",
    "writing the energy - momentum 4-vector as : @xmath100 the @xmath2 operations : @xmath101 , @xmath102 generate the lt equation for energy : @xmath103 from that of momentum @xmath104 or _",
    "vice versa_.",
    "the scalar product of two arbitary 4-vectors @xmath105,@xmath106 : @xmath107 can , by choosing the x - axis parallel to @xmath108 or @xmath109 , always be written as : @xmath110 defining the @xmath2 exchange operation for an arbitary 4-vector in a similar way to eqns.(1.2),(1.3 ) then the combined operations @xmath111 , @xmath112 yield : @xmath113 the 4-vector product changes sign , and so the combined @xmath2 operation is equivalent to a change in the sign convention of the metric from space - like to time - like ( or _ vice versa _ ) , hence the corollary ( ii ) in section 1 above .",
    "the lt equations take a particularly simple form if new variables are defined which have simple transformation properties under the @xmath2 operation .",
    "the variables are : @xmath114 @xmath115 , @xmath116 have , respectively , even and odd ` @xmath2 parity ' : @xmath117 the manifestly @xmath2 invariant lt equations expressed in terms of these variables are : @xmath118 where @xmath119 introducing similar variables for an arbitary 4-vector : @xmath120 the 4-vector scalar product of @xmath105 and @xmath106 may be written as : @xmath121    in view of the lt equations ( 4.16),(4.17 ) @xmath122 is manifestly lorentz invariant .",
    "the transformations ( 4.12),(4.13 ) and ( 4.19),(4.20 ) correspond to an anti - clockwise rotation by @xmath123 of the axes of the usual @xmath124 versus @xmath6 plot .",
    "the @xmath115,@xmath116 axes lie along the light cones of the @xmath6-@xmath124 plot ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the lt equations ( 4.16),(4.17 ) give a parametric representation of a hyperbola in @xmath115,@xmath116 space . a point on the latter corresponds to a particular space - time point as viewed in a frame @xmath0 .",
    "the point @xmath125 corresponds to the space - time origin of the frame @xmath1 moving with velocity @xmath126 relative to @xmath0 .",
    "a point at the spatial origin of @xmath1 at time @xmath127 will be seen by an observer in @xmath0 , as @xmath51 ( and hence @xmath128 ) varies , to lie on one of the hyperbolae @xmath129 , @xmath130 in fig.1 : @xmath131 with @xmath132 if @xmath133 ( @xmath129 ) or @xmath134 if @xmath135 ( @xmath130 ) . a point along the @xmath34 axis at a distance @xmath7 from the origin , at @xmath136 lies on the hyperbolae @xmath137 , @xmath138 : @xmath139 with @xmath140 , @xmath141 if @xmath142 ( @xmath137 ) or @xmath143 , @xmath144 if @xmath145 ( @xmath138 ) . as indicated in fig.1 the hyperbolae ( 4.22 )",
    "correspond to the past ( @xmath135 ) or the future ( @xmath133 ) of a space time point at the origin of @xmath0 or @xmath1 , whereas ( 4.23 ) corresponds to the ` elsewhere ' of the same space - time points .",
    "that is , the manifold of all space - time points that are causally disconnected from them .",
    "these are all familiar properties of the minkowski space x - ct plot .",
    "one may note , however , the simplicity of the equations ( 4.16),(4.17),(4.22 ) , ( 4.23 ) containing the ` lightcone ' variables @xmath146 that have simple transformation properties under the @xmath2 operation .",
    "another application of @xmath2 symmetry may be found in  @xcite .",
    "it is shown there that the apparent distortions of space - time that occur in observations of moving bodies or clocks are related by this symmetry .",
    "for example , the lorentz - fitzgerald contraction is directly related to time dilatation by the @xmath2 operations ( 1.2 ) and ( 1.3 ) .",
    "if a physical quantity is written in a manifestly covariant way , as a function of 4-vector products , it will evidently be invariant with respect to @xmath2 as the exchange operation has the effect only of changing the sign convention for 4-vector products from space - like to time - like or _ vice - versa_. an example of such a quantity is the invariant amplitude @xmath147 for an arbitary scattering process in quantum field theory . in this case",
    "@xmath2 invariance is equivalent to corollary ii of section 1 above .",
    "more interesting results can be obtained from equations where components of 4-vectors appear directly .",
    "it will now be shown how @xmath2 invariance may be used to derive ampre s law and maxwell s ` displacement current ' from the gauss law of electrostatics , and the faraday - lenz law of magnetic induction from the the gauss law of magnetostatics ( the absence of magnetic charges ) .",
    "thus electrodynamics and magnetodynamics follow from the laws of electrostatics and magnetostatics , together with space time exchange symmetry invariance .",
    "it will be seen that the 4-vector character of the electromagnetic potential plays a crucial role in these derivations .    in the following ,",
    "maxwell s equations are written in heaviside - lorentz units with @xmath148  @xcite .",
    "the 4-vector potential @xmath149 is related to the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath150 by the equation : @xmath151 where @xmath152 the electric and magnetic field components @xmath153 , @xmath154 respectively , are given , in terms of @xmath150 , by the equations : @xmath155 a time - like metric is used with @xmath156 , @xmath157 etc , with summation over repeated contravariant ( upper ) and covariant ( lower ) indices understood .",
    "repeated greek indices are summed form 1 to 4 and roman ones from 1 to 3 .    the transformation properties of contravariant and covariant 4-vectors under the @xmath2 operation are now discussed .",
    "they are derived from the general condition that 4-vector products change sign under the @xmath2 operation ( eqn.(4.11 ) ) .",
    "the 4-vector product ( 4.10 ) is written , in terms of contravariant and covariant 4-vectors , as : @xmath158 assuming that the contravariant 4-vector @xmath159 transforms according to eqns.(1.2 ) ( 1.3 ) , i.e. @xmath160 the covariant 4-vector @xmath161 must transform as : @xmath162 in order to respect the transformation property @xmath163 of 4-vector products under @xmath2 .    it remains to discuss the @xmath2 transformation properties of @xmath164 and the 4-vector potential @xmath165 . in view of the property of @xmath164 : @xmath166 ( eqn.(5.2 ) ) , which is similar to the relation @xmath167 for a _ covariant _ 4-vector , it is natural to choose for @xmath164 an @xmath2 transformation similar to eqn.(5.7 ) : @xmath168 and hence , in order that @xmath169 change sign under @xmath2 : @xmath170    this is because it is clear that the appearence of a minus sign in the @xmath2 transformation equation ( 5.7 ) is correlated to the minus sign in front of the spatial components of a covariant 4-vector , not whether the lorentz index is an upper or lower one .",
    "thus @xmath164 and @xmath171 transform in an ` anomalous ' manner under @xmath2 as compared to the convention of eqns.(5.6 ) and ( 5.7 ) . in order that the 4-vector product @xmath172 respect the condition ( 5.8 ) , @xmath165 and @xmath173",
    "must then transform under @xmath2 as : @xmath174 and @xmath175 respectively .",
    "that is , they transform in the same way as @xmath164 and @xmath171 respectively .    introducing the 4-vector electromagnetic current @xmath176 ,",
    "gauss law of electrostatics may be written as : @xmath177 or , in the manifestly covariant form : @xmath178 this equation is obtained by writing eqn.(5.13 ) in covariant notation using eqns.(5.1 ) and ( 5.3 ) and adding to the left side the identity : @xmath179 applying the space - time exchange operation to eqn.(5.14 ) , with index exchange @xmath180 ( noting that @xmath181 , @xmath19 transform according to eqns(5.9),(5.11 ) , @xmath182 according to ( 5.6 ) , and that the scalar products @xmath183 and @xmath184 change sign ) yields the equation : @xmath185 the spatial part of the 4-vector products on the left side of eqn.(5.16 ) is : @xmath186 where eqns.(5.1 ) and ( 5.4 ) have been used . the time",

    "the faraday - lenz law is now derived by applying the space - time exchange operation to the gauss law of magnetostatics : @xmath192 introducing eqns.(5.4 ) and ( 5.1 ) into eqn.(5.21 ) gives : @xmath193 making the exchange @xmath194 of space - time indices in eqn.(5.22 ) and noting that @xmath195 transforms according to eqn.(5.10 ) , whereas @xmath196 , @xmath20 transform as in eqns.(5.9),(5.11 ) respectively , gives : @xmath197 using eqns.(5.1)-(5.4 ) , eqn.(5.23 ) may be written as : @xmath198 or , in 3-vector notation : @xmath199 the space - time exchanges @xmath200 , @xmath201 in eqn.(5.22 ) yield , in a similar manner , the 2 and 3 components of the faraday - lenz law : @xmath202    some comments now on the conditions for the validity of the above derivations .",
    "it is essential to use the manifestly covariant form of the electrostatic gauss law eqn.(5.14 ) and the manifestly rotationally invariant form , eqn.(5.22 ) , of the magnetostatic gauss law .",
    "for example , the 1-axis may be chosen parallel to the electric field in eqn.(5.13 ) . in this case eqn.(5.14 ) simplifies to @xmath203 applying the space - time exchange operation @xmath204 to this equation yields only the maxwell displacement current term in eqn.(5.19 ) .",
    "similarly , choosing the 1-axis parallel to @xmath205 in eqn.(5.21 ) simplifies eqn.(5.22 ) to @xmath206 the index exchange @xmath194 leads then to the equation : @xmath207 instead of the 1-component of the faraday - lenz law , as in eqn.(5.24 ) .",
    "the choice of the @xmath2 transformation properties of contravariant and covariant 4-vectors according to eqns.(5.6 ) and ( 5.7 ) is an arbitary one .",
    "identical results are obtained if the opposite convention is used . however , ` anomalous ' transformation properties of @xmath164 , @xmath171 and @xmath165 , @xmath173 , in the sense described above , are essential .",
    "this complication results from the upper index on the left side of eqn.(5.2 ) whereas on the right side the spatial derivative is multiplied by a minus sign .",
    "this minus sign changes the @xmath2 transformation property relative to that , ( 5.6 ) , of conventional contravariant 4-vectors , that do not have a minus sign multiplying the spatial components",
    ". the upper index on the left side of eqn.(5.2 ) is a consequence of the lorentz transformation properties of the four dimensional space - time derivative  @xcite .",
    "in this paper the lorentz transformation for points lying along the common @xmath6 , @xmath34 axis of two inertial frames has been derived from only two postulates : ( i ) the symmetry principle ( i ) , and ( ii ) the homogeneity of space .",
    "this is the same number of axioms as used in ref.[6 ] where the postulates were : the kinematical special relativity postulate and the uniqueness condition .",
    "since both spatial homogeneity and uniqueness require the lt equations to be linear , the ksrp of ref.[6 ] has here , essentially , been replaced by the space - time symmetry condition ( i ) .    although postulate ( i ) and the krsp play equivalent roles in the derivation of the lt , they state in a very different way the physical foundation of special relativity . postulate ( i )",
    "is a mathematical statement about the structure of the equations of physics , whereas the ksrp makes , instead , a statement about the relation between space - time measurements performed in two different inertial frames .",
    "it is important to note that in neither case do the dynamical laws describing any particular physical phenomenon enter into the derivation of the lt .",
    "choosing postulate ( i ) as the fundamental principle of special relativity instead of the galilean relativity principle , as in the traditional approach , has the advantage that a clear distinction is made , from the outset , between classical and relativistic mechanics .",
    "both the former and the latter respect the galilean relativity principle but with different laws . on the other hand ,",
    "only relativistic equations , such as the lt or maxwell s equations , respect the symmetry condition ( i ) .",
    "the teaching of , and hence the understanding of , special relativity differs greatly depending on how the parameter @xmath3 is introduced . in axiomatic derivations of the lt , that do not use einstein s second postulate ,",
    "a universal parameter @xmath3 with the dimensions of velocity necessarily appears at an intermediate stage of the derivation  @xcite .",
    "its physical meaning , as the absolute upper limit of the observed velocity of _ any _ physical object , only becomes clear on working out the kinematical consequences of the lt  @xcite .",
    "if einstein s second postulate is used to introduce the parameter @xmath28 , as is done in the vast majority of text - book treatments of special relativity , justified by the empirical observation of the constancy of the velocity of light , the actual universality of the theory is not evident .",
    "the misleading impression may be given that special relativity is an aspect of classical electrodynamics , the domain of physics in which it was discovered .",
    "formulating special relativity according to the symmetry principle ( i ) makes clear the space - time geometrical basis  @xcite of the theory .",
    "the universal velocity parameter @xmath3 must be introduced at the outset in order even to define the space - time exchange operation . unlike the galilean relativity principle",
    ", the symmetry condition ( i ) gives a clear test of whether any physical equation is a candidate to describe a universal law of physics .",
    "such an equation must either be invariant under space - time exchange or related by the exchange operation to another equation that also represents a universal law .",

    "maxwell s equations are examples of dynamical laws that satisfy the symmetry condition ( i ) .",
