    "hollandite crystals have been the subject of a number of investigations , due to their interesting physical properties intimately related to their low dimensional character @xcite .",
    "the hollandite structure is based on double chains of @xmath1 octahedra ( @xmath2=transition element such as ru , rh ... ) conferring a quasi - one dimensional ( 1d ) structure .",
    "recent calculations of the electronic structure of @xmath0 indicate that the fermi surface itself has a quasi-1d nature , with two sheet - like surfaces which are parallel and separated by a wave vector @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this result is in agreement with reports of anisotropic electronic conduction mechanisms and possible dimensional cross - over in hollandites @xcite .    in a pure 1d electronic interacting system",
    ", only collective excitations can exist .",
    "a fermi liquid description is not possible and is replaced by a tomonaga - luttinger liquid with spins and charges separation@xcite .",
    "recently , a strong violation of the wiedeman - franz law in the low dimensional purple bronze @xmath4 was found consistent with tomonaga - luttinger liquid theory @xcite . in a low dimensional system , it is well known that a charge density wave instability due the electron - lattice coupling can also be expected , resulting in a low temperature resistivity upturn .",
    "this is not observed in @xmath0 which shows a metallic behavior along the conducting chains with no anomaly down to low temperatures ( t = 1.8 k ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the imperfect nesting of the fermi surface reported in @xcite .",
    "the strong warping of the two parallel pairs of fermi surfaces of @xmath0 @xcite indicates also that the system is not perfectly 1d and that interchains coupling is substantial . as a consequence",
    ", there is a place for physical properties at a dimension larger than one at low temperature , such as fermi liquid transport properties @xcite .",
    "for example , 3d fermi liquid properties are recovered at low temperature in the quasi-1d cuprate @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "opposite temperature dependence for the in plane and out of plane resistivity have been reported in @xmath0 for a temperature t@xmath6180 k @xcite , as expected for quasi-1d electronic transport showing incoherent transverse conduction .",
    "however , the electronic anisotropy appears strongest at low temperature , a result which is not expected in quasi-1d materiels where the interchains hopping takes place at low temperature leading to a more 3d behavior . note that another hollandite @xmath7 @xcite shows a behavior more in line with this expected dimensional crossover .",
    "it suggests that if @xmath0 presents the quasi-1d fermi surface , some additional resistive processes could take place at low temperature .",
    "the characterization of a fermi liquid is often based upon the thermal variation of the resistivity . a quadratic term @xmath8 is expected at low temperature for landau quasiparticle - quasiparticle interaction , i.e. a fermi liquid behavior , for dimensions greater or equal to two @xcite .",
    "its observation can indicate that the system has free quasiparticle excitations and invalidates _ a priori _ the existence of a more exotic electronic state imposed by a 1d motion of interacting electrons @xcite .",
    "then , the transition from a @xmath9 to a different power law can indicate a transition from a fermi liquid to non fermi liquid behavior , i.e. from a 2d or 3d to a 1d behavior .",
    "experimentally , the analysis of the low temperature resistivity is however not trivial due to the unavoidable sample disorder and impurities @xcite . in particular , metallic oxides present different kind of structural defects and disorder ( cationic and oxygen disorder for instance ) which result in a large residual resistivity @xmath10 .",
    "assuming matthiesen rule to hold , the resistivity can be written in the form    @xmath11    with @xmath12 the resistivity due to phonon scattering . at a low temperature , @xmath12 is negligible and the @xmath9 dependence can be observed . as discussed in @xcite , the quadratic temperature dependence can also arise from different mechanisms : not only carrier - carrier scattering through strong coulomb interactions @xcite but also from carrier magnetic moment scattering @xcite .",
    "another possible mechanism is the so - called koshino - taylor effect describing inelastic scattering against impurities @xcite .",
    "this effect is particular in the sense that @xmath10 can not be simply subtracted to extract the intrinsic resistivity .",
    "including all terms , the low temperature resistivity should be rewritten as @xcite    @xmath13    in principle , extracting the coefficient @xmath14 of strong correlations requires then to plot the slope @xmath15 of @xmath16 versus @xmath9 ( at low temperature where the phonon contribution to the resistivity freezes out ) .",
    "different values of @xmath10 can be obtained by tuning the pressure or by measuring samples with different amount of disorder .",
    "if @xmath15 does not depend on @xmath10 , then a fermi - liquid scenario can be inferred .",
    "otherwise , inelastic scattering by impurities is likely the relevant mechanism . in classical metals ,",
    "the koshino taylor effect is a small effect but can be observed @xcite .",
    "it has been shown to be more important for at least two recent and highlighted materials , in superconducting pnictides @xcite and in graphene @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the low dimensional character of graphene was shown to be a possible reason of a reinforced strength of the koshino - taylor effect compared to ordinary metals .",
    "we report here measurements of the magneto - transport properties of the metallic and paramagnetic low dimensional oxide @xmath0 for samples from the same batch but with different residual resistivities .",
    "the koshino - taylor effect is observed to be strong and dominant at low temperature , and is simultaneous with a large resistance noise .",
    "@xmath0 is an alkaline ruthenium hollandite .",
    "single crystals of @xmath0 were grown by using a flux method as described in @xcite .",
    "the obtained crystals have a needle - like form with a typical dimension of 1 mm @xmath17 0.05 mm @xmath17 0.05 mm .",
    "unit - cell parameters are a=9.913(5 )  , and c=3.108(5 )  . for the resistance measurements ,",
    "four gold wires with a diameter of 20 @xmath18 m were glued with silver paste . to obtain a low contact resistance ,",
    "the sample was annealed at 673 k during 10 min in air .",
    "the samples present low residual resistivities , typically in the @xmath19 range , close to the best crystals of @xmath20 where unconventional superconductivity has been observed @xcite .",
    "transport measurements have been performed in a ppms quantum design equipped with a 14 t magnet and a rotator . for the noise measurements",
    ", we use a home made sample holder .",
    "the sample is biased with a noise free current supply of 100 ma , voltage time series are amplified using ultra low noise preamplifiers ( sa-400f3 ) enclosed in a thick box and the signal is then anti aliased and fourier transformed in real time using a pci acquisition card ( see details in @xcite ) . in",
    "what follows , @xmath16 will stand for the resistivity along the chains , i.e. along the c - axis .",
    "in the figure 1 is shown a typical @xmath21 curve , very similar as previous reports @xcite .",
    "the metallic character is pronounced , and the residual resistivity is low for an oxide ( in the @xmath22.cm range ) , giving a rrr ratio @xmath23 for the purest sample .",
    "contrarily to another quasi-1d hollandite @xmath24 @xcite , no upturn of the zero field resistivity is observed at low temperature .",
    "an estimation of the electronic mean free path @xmath25 along the chain using the relation @xmath26 @xcite gives a rather large mean free path @xmath27 130 nm at 2k .    at low temperature where the phonon resistivity freezes out",
    ", a classical approach is to fit @xmath21 as a power law @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29=2 is expected for electron - electron ( baber - landau ) scattering @xcite , carrier - magnetic moment scattering @xcite and scattering by impurities and dislocations @xcite .",
    "since @xmath0 is a pauli paramagnet @xcite , only the first and third cases have to be considered .",
    "an exponent of @xmath29=2.7 has been previously reported in @xmath0 for temperature lower than 62 k and was discussed as arising from electron - electron umklapp scattering in a 1d conductor @xcite , as described by oshiyama et al @xcite .",
    "however , the two pairs of warped fermi surface needed to realize this umklapp scattering were not observed in @xcite . we have measured three samples of the same batch exhibiting different residual resistivity @xmath10 , implying different impurities concentration .",
    "depending on @xmath10 , the thermal variation of the resistivity at the lowest temperatures ( typically below 50 k ) exhibits different power law dependences .",
    "this variation is at least partly due to the resistivity saturation , i.e. its intrinsic nature is difficult to prove .",
    "contrarily , a @xmath9 component is observed for all samples and for temperatures slighly larger than the temperature where @xmath16 starts to saturate ( inset of fig.1 ) .",
    "an important observation is that the slope @xmath15 of @xmath30 in the equation(2 ) is different for the three measured samples ( fig.2 ) , with differences significantly larger than the uncertainty in the values of @xmath15 ( error bars are due to approximations when measuring the sample size and the distance between contacts ) .",
    "as discussed above , it implies that electron - electron scattering alone can not explain the @xmath9 dependence of the resistivity .",
    "as shown in fig.2 , the data can be describe by the equation @xmath31 , with a slope @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we conclude that the fermi liquid component @xmath14 is extremely low here , and the koshino - taylor component is dominating .",
    "note that the sommerfeld coefficient of @xmath0 is about 3 @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to a moderately renormalized mass of carriers , in agreement with a `` non strongly correlated '' character implied by the very low value of @xmath14 .",
    "the value of @xmath35 is orders of magnitude larger than koshino - taylor effects reported in the literature .",
    "more precisely , taylor s prediction was @xmath36 for conventional metals , i.e @xmath37 using @xmath38 @xcite what is largely lower than our experimental value . in the layered iron arsenide @xmath39 ,",
    "a value of @xmath40 was reported @xcite , and @xmath41 in nb - ti @xcite .",
    "our value is closer to what was reported in @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "an unusual large transverse electron - phonon coupling was then suggested @xcite .",
    "a large koshino - taylor effect was recently discussed for the graphene , taking into account the low dimensional character of the lattice fluctuations @xcite .",
    "we propose that a similar argument should be applied to @xmath0 which presents a quasi-1d lattice .",
    "the predicted @xmath44 dependence of the koshino - taylor correction to the resistivity @xcite is not observed however , in a reasonable temperature range . note",
    "that a @xmath45 dependence gives a sightly better agreement than a pure @xmath9 dependence in our data because it extends down to lowest temperature .",
    "this dependence was deduced in the extension of electron phonon impurity interference theory of reizer - sergueev at low dimension @xcite .",
    "it could explain the non fermi liquid like dependence reported in some @xmath0 samples @xcite .",
    "we would like to stress that if it is difficult to conclude on the exact temperature dependence , i.e. @xmath9 or @xmath45 , the dependence on the residual resistivity is a strong support to consider here inelastic scattering against impurities as a major process .",
    "the magnetoresistance mr=@xmath46 is positive for all temperatures and shows strong angular angular dependence ( see fig.3 ) , being consistent with both a lorentz force driven mr and a large anisotropy of the fermi surface in our geometry .",
    "a mr of more than 90 % is observed at 14 t and at low temperature ( t=1.8 k , fig.3 ) .",
    "this large value is consistent with the large mean free path of @xmath0 .",
    "as shown in the figure 3 , the mr at low field has a non quadratic field dependence , and can be fitted by a 1.3 power law .",
    "a conventional and metallic mr is supposed have a low field @xmath47 component , but lowest exponents in the range 1.3 - 1.5 have been already reported in low dimensional bronze oxides @xcite , organic conductors @xcite or in metallic nanowires such as bi @xcite .",
    "no clear saturation of the mr can be observed up to 14 t . at the lowest temperature that we have measured ( t=1.8k )",
    ", the mr tends to curve downward at large field , indicating an incipient saturation .",
    "this can be described by a two band model with uncompensated carriers @xcite , similarly to @xcite .",
    "the kohler plot @xmath48 of mr shows that the galvanomagnetic processes can be separated in two temperature ranges ( fig.4 ) . for @xmath4918",
    "k , the mr curves are superimposed on the same plot . for @xmath50 , the kohler rule is not supported by the data . as a general rule , the kohler rule applies in the case of a single scattering process @xcite .",
    "this is the case for @xmath51 where the resistivity becomes temperature independent and tends to the residual resistivity value . at larger temperature @xmath50 ,",
    "the contribution of the koshino taylor resistivity becomes apparent and breaks the kohler rule , as expected if the two scaterring processes have different magnetic field dependence .",
    "note that the magnetic field dependence of mr is unchanged when crossing @xmath52 , strongly suggesting that the koshino - taylor mechanism contributes to the zero field resistivity but not significantly to the mr .",
    "noise is a powerful tool to investigate the low frequency dynamics of electronic processes @xcite , and appears particularly interesting for low dimensional systems since fluctuations increase in principle when dimensions shrink .",
    "the experimental quantity is here the noise spectrum @xmath53 of the fluctuating voltage from the sample , using the set - up described in the experimental part .",
    "the noise values present a quadratic dependence with the applied current , as expected for noise driven by the fluctuations of resistance . after analyzing the time series of noise spectra",
    ", there is no evidence of non gaussian components of the noise ( it corresponds to a white so called second spectrum @xcite ) .",
    "it can be assumed then that the noise arises from uncorrelated random processes .",
    "we have measured @xmath53 of @xmath0 as function of the temperature under a constant 100 ma current .",
    "noise values are large when comparing with conventional metals , but also large compared to another hollandite @xmath24 where the noise was not measurable with the same experimental set - up @xcite . to discuss normalized values between different materials of different resistances , the hooge parameter @xmath54",
    "is usually employed @xcite .",
    "@xmath55 is the carrier density ( @xmath56 @xmath57 @xcite ) , @xmath58 is the noisy ( probed ) volume and @xmath59 2 here .",
    "we deduce @xmath60 , i.e. four order of magnitude larger than metallic values which are around 0.01 @xcite .",
    "such a large value is not rare in oxides , as for example reported in colossal magnetoresistance manganites , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) and in @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) @xcite .",
    "note that for low dimensional conducting processes , assuming that the noisy volume @xmath65 corresponds to the whole volume between the probes is an overestimation if inhomogeneous charge propagation paths exist .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath66 is shown in fig .",
    "interestingly , it increases sharply in the same temperature range where the @xmath9 component of resistivity dominates , and then tends to saturate at low temperature .",
    "it shows a direct correlation between the change in the scattering processes and the electronic fluctuations .",
    "consequently , we have to associate the reinforced resistance fluctuations with the scattering from impurities due to the koshino - taylor effect .",
    "it has to be emphasized that the spectral shape of the noise is @xmath67 with @xmath68 for the whole temperature range ( inset of fig.5 ) .",
    "noise usually arises from the activated motion of defects , dislocations or impurities .",
    "these processes can have an intrinsic lorentzian spectrum which presents a @xmath69 dependence for frequencies large enough @xcite .",
    "however , at a macroscopic scale , the distribution of energy barriers results in a @xmath70-like noise @xcite .",
    "@xmath68 is then rarely observed in bulk materials compared to @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "for example @xmath69 noise can be caused by stress induced dislocations or strain relaxations @xcite , but it has been rarely observed in metals where @xmath70 noise dominates @xcite except when the sample was submitted to very large strains @xcite .",
    "a @xmath69 power spectrum corresponds also to a brownian noise and arises directly from the statistics of a 1d random walk .",
    "we propose that the @xmath69 dependence of the spectrum is here characteristic of the 1d nature of charges fluctuations .",
    "of course , it would be necessary to perform similar experiments in other 1d or quasi 1d oxides to strengthen this result .",
    "the strong increase of the normalized noise for t@xmath72150 k appears when the @xmath9 component of resistivity appears , i.e. the large koshino - taylor effect , revealing a strong coupling between the charges fluctuations and the fluctuations of the lattice .",
    "we note that an anomalous temperature dependence of the seebeck coefficient was reported in the same temperature range @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have measured the galvanomagnetic properties and the resistance noise of quasi-1d hollandites @xmath0 . despite the relative cleanest of the samples revealed by the low residual resistivity",
    ", a very large inelastic scattering of carriers by impurities is revealed by the analysis of the transport properties .",
    "it can be due to the importance of the local fluctuations of the lattice in this highly anisotropic material as discussed in @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the resistance noise is strongly reinforced at low temperature and the @xmath69 spectral form of the noise is likely characteristics of the 1d nature of the carriers paths .",
