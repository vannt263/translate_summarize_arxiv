    "grandis @xcite , kopylov , kuz@xmath0minov @xcite or kopylov @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the reason for considering the categories above is in fact the hope that a certain , for example purely analytic , problem can be formulated in the language of exact sequences and then eventually be solved with the help of purely abstract methods of homological algebra . + the key notion for handling this situation on an abstract level ",
    "apart from ad hoc solutions  was invented by quillen @xcite ( see bhler @xcite ) and is that of an exact category . given any additive category , one chooses a so - called exact structure , i.e.  a system of kernel - cokernel pairs satisfying certain axioms .",
    "then , roughly speaking , the pairs in this system behave like the short exact sequences of an abelian category and homological algebra is possible with respect to them ; note that the derived category can be defined for each exact category , see neeman @xcite .",
    "in any additive category , the set of all split short exact sequences is an exact structure and by definition it is the smallest one .",
    "if the category in addition has kernels and cokernels ( i.e.  is preabelian ) then there also exists a largest or maximal exact structure ( see sieg , wegner @xcite ) formed by those kernel - cokernel pairs @xmath1 in which @xmath2 is a semi - stable kernel in the notation of richman , walker @xcite , that is in any pushout    e & ^f & f + ^ & & _",

    "a preabelian category is quasi - abelian and thus admits an intrinsic notion of exactness , cf .",
    "schneiders @xcite , if and only if the maximal exact structure consists of all kernel - cokernel pairs ; this is equivalent to the fact that all kernels and cokernels are semi - stable . + in the light of the above , for a given preabelian category in which homological methods are to be applied , the first task is to determine the semi - stable ( co-)kernels . in fact , there is a whole zoo of properties between `` ( quasi-)abelian '' and `` pre - abelian '' ( see  fig .  1 in section [ examples ] ) clarifying this task .",
    "so - called left quasi - abelian categories are defined by making the above definition one - sided , i.e.  by requiring all cokernels to be semi - stable .",
    "right quasi - abelian categories are defined dually .",
    "a category is semi - abelian if for each morphism the induced morphism between the cokernel of the kernel and the kernel of the cokernel is simultaneously a monomorphism and an epimorphism .",

    "propositions [ t1 ] and [ t2 ] and theorem [ t3 ] show that the last three properties can also be formulated in terms of inheritance properties under pushouts and pullbacks .",

    "+ in section [ prep ] , we specify our notation and present some preparatory results which are rather simple but very useful for our purposes . in section [ mainresult ] , we establish a characterization of right and by dualization of left semi - abelian categories via six equivalent conditions , which we combine in our main theorem ( theorem [ t3 ] ) to obtain a characterization of semi - abelianity . in the last section [ examples ] , we present two examples illustrating that left semi - abelian categories which are not right semi - abelian ( and vice versa ) exist and occur in nature .",
    "+ to conclude our introduction , let us mention that the notion of a semi - abelian category in the above sense was invented several times by different mathematicians under different names .",
    "such categories seem to have first appeared in bnic , popescu @xcite under the name of catgories pre - abliennes . at the end of the 1960 s ,",
    "palamodov @xcite introduced the same concept under the name of semi - abelian categories and developed homological algebra within them in order to treat projective and inductive limits of locally convex spaces .",
    "later , these categories  again as semi - abelian categories  were rediscovered by rump @xcite , who introduced the notions of left and right semi - abelianity .",
    "we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) for more historical comments on semi - abelian and quasi - abelian categories and detailed references .",
    "+ we point out that in the current literature the term `` semi - abelian category '' also refers to a pointed barr - exact protomodular category with binary products , see janelidze , mrki , tholen @xcite .",

    "in the sequel let @xmath5 be a preabelian category , i.e.  an additive category with kernels and cokernels . for a morphism @xmath6 in @xmath5",
    "we denote by @xmath7 its kernel and by @xmath8 its cokernel .",

    "<S> in the sense of palamodov , a preabelian category is semi - abelian if for every morphism the natural morphism between the cokernel of its kernel and the kernel of its cokernel is simultaneously a monomorphism and an epimorphism . in this article we present several conditions which are all equivalent to semi - abelianity . </S>",
    "<S> first we consider left and right semi - abelian categories in the sense of rump and establish characterizations of these notions via six equivalent properties . </S>",
    "<S> then we use these properties to deduce the characterization of semi - abelianity . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we investigate two examples arising in functional analysis which illustrate that the notions of right and left semi - abelian categories are distinct and in particular that such categories occur in nature . </S>"
