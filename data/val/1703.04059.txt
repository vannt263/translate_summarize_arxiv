    "massive ( @xmath4  10  m@xmath5 ) , runaway ( @xmath6  30  km  s@xmath7 ) stars are able to produce large - scale bow shocks in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "these shocks are driven by the interaction of the fast stellar wind ( @xmath8  1000  km  s@xmath7 ) , large proper motion , and the ism .",
    "the gas and dust in the pile - up material are heated and ionized by the strong uv radiation from the star which makes the bow shock observable at optical and infrared ( ir ) wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite analyzed very large array ( vla ) observations of the runaway o star bd@xmath243@xmath33654 and concluded that the radio emission is spatially coincident with the bow shock detected in ir images .",
    "more importantly , this extended radio emission was found to have a non - thermal origin .",
    "benaglia et al .",
    "argued that the non - thermal origin of the radio emission is produced by syncrotron emission .",
    "the electrons that generate this emission could upscatter photons from stellar and dust radiation fields through the inverse compton process , producing high - energy emission .",
    "this interesting detection opened a new window for exploring the production of non - thermal emission around massive stars , and a number of theoretical works addressing this phenomenon have been published ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite presented detailed analytical predictions for the non - thermal emission from bow shocks around o - type stars .",
    "these authors applied their model to the well - know and closest runaway star @xmath1oph , concluding that high - energy emission should be detected toward its bow shock .",
    "however , x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission has been eluding detection towards known runaway stars .",
    "@xcite presented fermi @xmath0-ray space telescope observations of a sample of 27 bow shocks ( including @xmath1oph ) accumulated over 57 months with no positive detections .",
    "@xcite extended this study up to 73 bow shocks using the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescopes in the tev regime with the same conclusions . in x - rays",
    "no detections were obtaned either , despite the dedicated observational campains using _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ suzaku _ x - ray telescopes @xcite .",
    "[ fig : wise_rgb ]    there has been only one claim of detection of non - thermal x - ray emission toward a runaway star .",
    "@xcite presented _ xmm - newton _ observations of ae  aur and reported the discovery of a `` blob '' of x - ray emission at @xmath930@xmath10 northeast from the star .",
    "these authors also presented a model to explain their results , but we notice that their spectral analysis can not be used to discriminate between a thermal and a non - thermal origin .",
    "furthermore , these authors compare their _ xmm - newton _ observations with low - resolution mid - ir _ wise _ observations . under the assumption that this detection is related to ae  aur",
    ", @xcite presented further analytical modelling for this x - ray emission .",
    "they concluded that non - thermal processes in bow shocks around runaway stars are responsible for a significant fraction of the high - energy photons produced in our galaxy .    in this paper",
    "we present a search for non - thermal diffuse x - ray emission in bow shocks around o - type stars .",
    "we use archived _ xmm - newton _ observations of a sample of well - determined galactic runaway stars .",
    "section  2 presents our sample and describe the _ xmm - newton _ observations . in section  3 and 4",
    "we presents and discuss our results , respectively .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section  5 .",
    "to obtain a clear sample of runaway o stars we searched the list presented by @xcite .",
    "these authors identified runaway stars using the proper motions reported by the first gaia data release ( dr1 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "their table  1 presents a list of confirmed candidates as well as a list of new discoveries .",
    "we cross - corretated that table with archived _ xmm - newton _ epic observations and clear detections of bow shocks in the _ wise _ w4 22  @xmath11 m or _ spitzer _ mips 24  @xmath11 m band . as a result ,",
    "our sample consists of 6 objects : bd@xmath1214@xmath35040 , hd24760 ( @xmath13per ) , hd57682 , hd153919 , hd188001 ( 9sge ) , and hd210839 ( @xmath14cep ) .",
    "figure  1 presents mid - ir colour - composite _ wise _ images of the six objects studied in this paper .",
    "details of the x - ray observations used in this paper are given in table  1 .",
    "columns 5 , 6 , and 7 of table  1 present the total exposure time for the pn , mos1 , and mos2 epic cameras , respectively .",
    "it is worth mentioning that almost all observations were performed with deep exposures ( @xmath15  ks ) , except for the cases of hd24760 and hd57682 ( @xmath16  ks ) .",
    "observations of bd@xmath1214@xmath35040 were only performed using the mos cameras but with deep exposure times of @xmath17  ks .",
    "finally , we remark that the epic cameras have a fwhm@xmath186 .    [ cols=\"^,^,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the detection of non - thermal radio emission associated with the bow shock around bd@xmath243@xmath33654 @xcite opened a door for studies of particle acceleration by massive stars .",
    "those vla observations showed that the non - thermal emission has an extended distribution , spatially coincident with the bow shock observed by the midcourse space experiment ( msx ) in the d ( 14.65  @xmath11 m ) bandm image presented by @xcite . ] .",
    "since then , the idea that charged particles in the compress ism ( the bow shock ) can cool down by non - thermal processes ( such as syncrotron radiation ) , has been studied extensively in theoretical studies ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . but the absence of firmly confirmed detections of high - energy non - thermal emission is pushing the limits of theory , even for the case of bd@xmath243@xmath193654 .    in order to estimate upper limits to the non - thermal diffuse x - ray emission , we extracted background - subtracted spectra from regions spatially coincident with the bow shocks in our sample .",
    "the obtained background count rates in the 0.35.0  kev energy range along with the estimated hydrogen column densities ( @xmath20 ) were used to obtain absorbed ( @xmath21 ) and unabsorbed ( @xmath22 ) x - ray fluxes . using the _ chandra _ pimms tool we estimated the fluxes assuming that the emission can be modeled by a power - law spectrum with @xmath23 .",
    "table  2 shows that our estimated observed fluxes are comparable to those reported by @xcite for @xmath1oph and bd@xmath243@xmath33654 .",
    "our systematic search using a clean sample of runaway massive stars add to the list of bow shocks around runaway stars without non - thermal diffuse x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "our present results encouraged us to question the previously claimed detection of non - thermal x - ray emission in the bow shock around ae  aur @xcite . in appendix",
    "a , we show that the detected emission is a point - like source unrelated to the bow shock around ae  aur .",
    "it has become evident that current theoretical models overpredict the flux of the non - thermal diffuse x - ray emission in bow shocks around runaray . to start with",
    ", @xcite adopted a mass - loss rate a factor of @xmath245 greater than that reported by @xcite , overestimating the density of high - energy particles . on the other hand , unlike the cases of supernova remnants which are known to emit considerably non - thermal x - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , the open morphologies of bow shocks around runaway stars might reduce the injection efficiency of energy from thermal plasma to accelerate particles and produce non - thermal emission .",
    "we have searched for non - thermal diffuse x - ray emission associated with bow shocks around runaway o - type stars .",
    "xmm - newton _ observations of a sample of 6 well determined runaway stars and found no evidence of such emission .",
    "we also revised the only claimed case of non - thermal diffuse x - ray emission detected from a bow shock , ae  aur .",
    "there is emission ; however , its spatial distribution is consistent with being that of a point source .",
    "moreover , this x - ray source is not spatially coincident with the bow shock .",
    "thus , we conclude that this x - ray emission is not associated with the bow shock .",
    "thus far , there are 9 bow shocks around o  stars that stand in defiance of the recent and growing body of theoretical predictions for non - thermal diffuse x - ray emissions from such structures .",
    "we conclude that , if this predicted non - thermal diffuse x - ray emission is present in bow shocks around runaway o stars , it is below the detection limits of the current x - ray satellites .",
    "+      [ fig : wise_rgb ]    the authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for valuable comments that improved our manuscript .",
    "this work was based on observations obtained with",
    "_ xmm  newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa .",
    "this publication also makes use of data obtained with _",

    "the absence of non - thermal diffuse x - ray emission towards the sample of six bow shocks presented in this paper , along with previously reported undetections ( see section  1 ) , questions the nature and presence of the x - ray emission towards ae  aur reported by @xcite . to confirm previous results ,",
    "we have analyzed the _ xmm - newton _ observations of ae  aur in a similar way as described for other sources studied here .",
    "we compare our x - ray images to _ spizer _ mips and irac images .",
    "the left panel of figure  3 shows the higher - resolution image of the _ spitzer _ data as compared to the _ wise _ w3 image ( see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the right panel of figure  3 presents a comparison of the _ spizer _ irac 8  @xmath11 m and the medium and hard x - ray bands .",
    "this panel confirms that the blob of x - ray emission has a point - like shape with an angular separation of 35 from ae  aur , but also that this emission is not spatially coincident with the bow shock around ae  aur .",

    "this x - ray blob is not one of the dense molecular globules detected in co @xmath2425 from ae  aur ( see globule # 5 in figure  2 of * ? ? ?",
