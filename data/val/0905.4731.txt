    "because the monte carlo trials are cpu intensive , we plan to use that relation to determine relative weights in the future .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty of our europium abundances to be the sum of the squares of the residuals for all three lines , where we assign the residuals the same relative weights we applied when calculating the average .",

    "the error floor comes from a comparison of abundance values from the individual lines ( figure [ line_compare ] , discussed in more detail in  [ compare_lines ] ) ; error bars of @xmath319 on each measurement would make the reduced @xmath320  @xmath321 .",
    "a minimum error of @xmath319 on each europium measurement translates into an uncertainty of @xmath318 for the final averaged value .",
    "the @xmath318 error floor is included in the uncertainty quoted in table [ starsvals_table ] .        as an initial test of the robustness of our fitting routine",
    ", we measure the europium abundance in a spectrum of vesta , which serves as a solar proxy .",
    "the values are listed in the last row of table [ starsvals_table ] .",
    "the three vesta europium abundances have a standard deviation of @xmath322 , indicating that systematic errors ( @xmath3@xmath319 for vesta , its offset from the solar value ) may be a significant portion of the error budget .",
    "for the moment we absorb any systematic error with our random error estimates . the full sample of 1000 stars , the analysis of which will follow this work , will allow a far more thorough investigation of the dependence of our results on various model parameters ( @xmath150 , @xmath310 , etc . )  than can be accomplished here .",

    "<S> we present a new technique for measuring the abundance of europium , a representative _ r_-process  element , in solar - metallicity stars . </S>",
    "<S> our algorithm compares lte synthetic spectra with high - resolution observational spectra using a @xmath0-minimization routine . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is fully automated , and therefore allows consistent measurement of blended lines even across very large stellar samples . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with literature europium abundance measurements and find them to be consistent ; we also find our method generates smaller errors . </S>"
