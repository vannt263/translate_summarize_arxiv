    "nano / micro - mechanical resonators are fascinating devices , having microscopic dimensions and high quality factors ( @xmath0s ) that allow them to be used in precise experiments .",
    "they are therefore ideal for many measurement applications , including biosensing @xcite , charge measurements @xcite , mass sensing @xcite , accelerometry @xcite , temperature sensing @xcite , torque or force transduction @xcite , single spin detection @xcite , and observation of qubits @xcite .",
    "in addition , nano / micro - mechanical resonators provide an excellent platform for investigating scientific phenomena , such as vortices @xcite , quantum zero - point motion @xcite , molecular structure @xcite , gravity @xcite , superfluidity @xcite , and the casimir force @xcite .",
    "as nano / micro - mechanical resonator systems become capable of performing ever more precise experiments , the sensitivity of the detection methods used to observe the devices must increase commensurately .",
    "current state of the art techniques used for this detection include capactive measurements @xcite , free - space optics @xcite , piezoresitivity @xcite , and optomechanics @xcite .",
    "these methods offer extremely senstive transduction , achieving sub - attometer displacement sensitivity @xcite , yoctogram mass resolution @xcite , and force measurements on the order of attonewtons @xcite .    in order to quantify such sensitive measurements",
    ", it is crucial that the calibration of these devices be performed accurately . as the dimensions of nano / micro - mechanical resonators continue to decrease",
    ", this can prove to be a difficult task .",
    "however , there exists a powerful method by which the motion of these resonators can be calibrated via observation of their random thermal motion .",
    "this is known as _",
    "thermomechanical calibration _ and is performed by invoking the equipartition theorem , which establishes a relationship between the thermal energy of a device and its mean squared amplitude of motion @xcite .",
    "many of the detection methods mentioned above are sensitive enough to measure the thermal motion of devices on the micro or nanoscale .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that this calibration scheme agrees well with other methods , such as physically pushing on the device @xcite , but it has the advantage of being noninvasive .",
    "thermomechanical calibration has been used to measure the motion of many systems , including cantilevers @xcite , doubly clamped beams @xcite , strings @xcite , torsional resonators @xcite , and membranes @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no single standalone document exists that describes the method of thermomechanical calibration in its entirety .",
    "we have noticed that a number of mutually inconsistent approaches to performing such a calibration can be found in the literature .",
    "this manuscript intends to elucidate the process of thermomechanical calibration by providing a full , self - consistent derivation of the procedure and ensuring that all pertinent equations are explained and defined . in this way",
    ", a general process is developed by which nano / micro - mechanical resonators can be calibrated  the only difference between varying geometries being reduced to a single parameter , the device s effective mass . in this paper , the effective mass",

    "these calculations are then benchmarked against the well - known methods of sader _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite and cleveland _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite , which have been developed to calibrate atomic force microscopy cantilevers .",
    "in addition , we extend the methods of sader _ et al .  _ and cleveland _ et al .",
    "_ to encompass other resonator geometries , such as doubly clamped beams and torsional resonators .",
    "this document  which includes both a general overview of the process and specific examples  provides a clear , straightforward recipe for carrying out thermomechanical calibration for any nano / micromechanical resonator system , regardless of its complexity .",
    "we begin by describing the motion of an extended resonator structure in the linear regime . in general , the complete , three - dimensional motion will be given by a displacement function @xmath1 that can be broken down into an infinite number of independent modes . to each mode",
    "we ascribe a label , @xmath2 , allowing for the displacement function to be expressed as @xcite    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the mode shape of the @xmath5 mode , and @xmath6 is a function that describes the time dependence of the resonator s motion . here",
    "we choose to normalize @xmath4 such that the maximum value of @xmath7 is unity .",
    "this choice of normalization ensures that @xmath6 has units of distance [ as the normalization leaves @xmath4 unitless ] and is in 1 - 1 correspondence with the resonator s true physical displacement at the point of measurement .",
    "it should also be noted that by normalizing this way , the standard convention of orthonormality between the modes is lost .",
    "many devices can be described by simple models , for which we are able to determine @xmath4 analytically .",
    "when the device s motion is more complicated , however , we turn to fem modeling to determine the mode shape of the structure . in this paper , these two methods are compared in a number of situations where the analytical mode shapes of the resonator can be determined .    the function @xmath6 is determined by mapping each of the resonator s independent modes to a damped harmonic oscillator of the form @xcite",
    "@xmath8    here , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the angular frequency , quality factor , and effective mass for the @xmath5 mode of the resonator .",
    "@xmath12 is a time - dependent driving force .",
    "an effective spring constant for the @xmath5 mode can also be defined and is given by @xmath13 @xcite . a general expression for @xmath11 , along with its determination for a number of simple models ,",
    "will be outlined in sec .",
    "[ effmasssec ] .",
    "often a nano / micro - mechanical resonator s motion can be reduced to a one - dimensional displacement function    @xmath14    where @xmath15 describes the one - dimensional mode shape for the @xmath5 mode of the resonator as a function of position @xmath16 , and @xmath6 is unchanged from eq .  .",
    "as in the three - dimensional case , we choose to normalize @xmath15 such that the maximum value of @xmath17 is unity .",
    "this equation will be used when the displacement of a nano / micro - mechanical resonator is simple enough to be modeled by a one - dimensional function .",
    "equations   and fully describe the motion of these devices in the linear regime and will be used when explicating the thermal calibration process .",
    "the various methods used to detect the motion of a nano / micro - mechanical resonator share one major similarity : the motion of the resonator in question is encapsulated by some time - varying signal , typically a voltage . generally , this measured signal is transformed into the frequency domain , providing a spectral representation of the resonator s motion that is peaked ( up to small corrections in 1/@xmath0 ) at its resonance frequency . by squaring this spectrum and dividing by the resolution bandwidth of the instrument ,",
    "the measured one - sided power spectral density @xmath18 of the signal is produced @xcite .    when thermally calibrating a mechanical resonator , we must be able to relate the device s time averaged motion to its thermal energy .",
    "to do this , the equipartition theorem is used to express the device s mean - square amplitude of motion @xmath19 in terms of its thermal noise psd . in this section ,",
    "we derive a theoretical expression for the psd corresponding to a damped harmonic oscillator undergoing random thermal motion .",
    "this function can be used to properly calibrate thermal psd data for any nano / micro - mechanical resonator .",
    "we introduce the autocorrelation function @xmath20 , which describes how the signal @xmath21 is related to itself at a later time @xmath22 and is defined as @xcite    @xmath23    the two - sided power spectral density function @xmath24 , can then be obtained from the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function @xcite    @xmath25    likewise , the autocorrelation function can be produced by performing the inverse fourier transform    @xmath26    @xmath27 is defined such that it spans all frequencies , both positive and negative , and will give the total power of the signal if integrated over this entire frequency range .",
    "for real - valued signals , as is the case in physical situations , @xmath28 is an even function @xcite .",
    "therefore , we introduce @xmath29 , which is defined on the frequency interval from @xmath30 to @xmath31 such that it produces the power in the signal when integrated over all positive frequencies . from these two definitions , we find that @xmath29 and @xmath27 are related by @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this relation allows the total power in the signal to be conserved when each spectral density function is integrated over the frequency interval on which it is defined . in the rest of the derivation , @xmath29 will be used , as it provides a theoretical spectral density that can be fit directly to physical data .",
    "we define the quantity known as the mean - square amplitude of our signal as @xcite    @xmath33}^2 . \\label{meandef}\\ ] ]    upon inspection , we see that this quantity is equal to eq .   at zero time shift ,",
    "provided that we have sampled the signal @xmath6 over a sufficiently long time window ( i.e. ,  @xmath34 ) .",
    "using eq .  , along with the relation between between @xmath27 and @xmath29 , we can then express @xmath35 in terms of its psd via @xcite    @xmath36    this result provides us with the relationship between the mean - square amplitude and psd for @xmath6 . by fourier transforming eq .",
    ", we can relate @xmath29 to @xmath37 , which is the psd due to the forcing function @xmath12 @xcite :    @xmath38    the factor of proportionality comes from the frequency response function @xcite ,    @xmath39    here @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the fourier transforms of @xmath6 and @xmath12 . for thermomechanical calibration ,",
    "@xmath12 is generated by random thermal noise , which is broadband in the region of interest , producing a @xmath42 that will be flat with respect to frequency .",
    "we can therefore replace @xmath42 by a constant thermal force noise @xmath43 .",
    "this factor can be determined by combining eqs .",
    " , which results in    @xmath44    computing this integral by contour integration , gives @xmath45 @xcite .    invoking the equipartion theorem ,",
    "@xmath19 can be related to the thermal energy of the resonator .",
    "the equipartition theorem states that every degree of freedom that contributes a quadratic term to the total energy of a system has an average energy of @xmath46 @xcite . for the time",
    "averaged potential energy of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator considered here , this theorem is mathematically represented as @xcite    @xmath47    it can be seen by investigation of eq .   that the magnitude of @xmath6 is arbitrarily determined by our choice of normalization for @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , our effective mass must be chosen very carefully to match our definition of @xmath6 in order to preserve the validity of the equipartition theorem .",
    "this subtlety will be discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ effmasssec ] .",
    "combining the result from eq .   with the equipartition theorem gives @xcite    @xmath48    allowing us to express the oscillator s psd as @xcite    @xmath49}. \\label{psdtang}\\ ] ]    however , since the frequency we read off our instrument is given in terms of a natural frequency , @xmath50 , and not an angular frequency , it is convenient to express @xmath51 in terms of @xmath50 .",

    "however , we expect a number of other sources of noise to be present in our detection system , such as detector dark current and optical shot noise @xcite",
    ". these signals will combine with the thermal noise of the resonator to produce the power spectrum read out for the undriven device .",
    "if we assume these other sources of noise to be white , we can express our total psd as @xcite    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is a constant offset to account for the white noise of the detection apparatus and @xmath59 is a factor with units @xmath60 to allow for conversion of our theoretical displacement psd ( in units of @xmath61 ) to the measured voltage psd ( in units of @xmath62 ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath59 tells us how efficiently the detection system converts the motion of the resonator into the voltage signal that is measured and is closely tied to the sensitivity of the detection system .",
    "the experimentally measured psd is given as @xmath63 @xcite where @xmath64 is the voltage spectrum of the resonator s motion obtained with a measurement bandwidth @xmath65 .",
    "the experimental psd can be fit with eq .   near a thermal resonance using @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath66 , and @xmath10 as fit parameters .",

    "the resonator s displacement spectrum is then determined from @xmath71 , given in units of @xmath72 @xcite . from this data",
    ", we can determine the maximum displacement of the resonator , as well as the displacement sensitivity of the detection method , the latter of which is given by @xmath73 .",
    "the displacement sensitivity is often used as a figure of merit for a detection system @xcite , as it is a measure of the minimun detectable signal for that setup .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath59 is highly dependent on a number of factors , for instance photodiode gain or probe position , and therefore an @xmath59 value extracted from a specific set of data should be associated only with that data set itself and not the detection system .",
    "this being said , it is possible to conceive of an experiment where all parameters are carefully controlled such that the @xmath59 value for repeated data sets would be similar and could be combined to determine an average @xmath59 value .",
    "similarly , a number of data sets originating from a carefully controlled system could be combined into an averaged signal and fit with eq .   to provide a statistically significant value of @xmath59 .",
    "the theoretical psd functions obtained in this section are a general result for a damped harmonic oscillator excited by random thermal fluctuations and can be used for any nano / micro - mechanical resonator . the only difference in eq .",
    "[ eq .  ] that exists between varying resonators is the effective mass @xmath11 ( spring constant @xmath55 ) associated with the resonator s geometry .",
    "therefore , once we have the psd function given by eqs .   and , we need only focus on calculation of the device s effective mass . for this reason , the calculation of the effective mass for a number of resonator geometries will be the focus of the remaining portion of the document . for simplicity , we deal only with the quantity @xmath11 , as @xmath55 is directly related to @xmath11 through the mode s experimentally determined resonance frequency .",
    "in general , the effective mass associated with the specific mode of a resonator will depend on its mode shape . for this reason ,",
    "it is useful to investigate analytical expressions for the mode shapes and resonance frequencies of some simple geometries that are commonly used for nano / micro - mechanical resonators .",
    "a large number of nano / micro - mechanical resonators possess beam - like geometries and can be effectively modeled as macroscopic beam - like structures .",
    "the general equation of motion for a long thin beam of uniform cross section that is oscillating in one dimension is @xcite    @xmath74    where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 are the young s modulus , moment of inertia , density , and cross - sectional area of the beam .",
    "@xmath79 is an arbitrary position - dependent loading function .",
    "we know that @xmath80 will be in the form of eq .",
    ", so we can solve eq .",
    "for each of the resonator s @xmath2 modes separately . the oscillatory motion of the beam is encapsulated by @xmath6 and , for high @xmath0 resonators ,",
    "is given approximately as    @xmath81    where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are mode dependent constants .",
    "inputting @xmath84 into eq .   with this choice of @xmath6",
    ", we obtain for the free motion [ @xmath85 of a beam , a differential equation for the mode shape of the @xmath5 mode    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the length of the beam and @xmath88 is a dimensionless parameter .",
