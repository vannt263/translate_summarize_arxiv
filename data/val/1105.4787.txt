    "neutron stars represent very complex systems , the understanding of which relies on uncertain theory combined with largely indirect observational evidence .",
    "the nature of the deep neutron star core , and the state of matter within , remains poorly constrained .",
    "however , it is clear that the quality of the gathered data , and our interpretation of it , is improving . as evidence of recent progress , with direct impact on the work discussed in this paper",
    ", we may consider the quasiperiodic oscillations observed in the tails of giant magnetar flares  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the data in terms of torsional oscillations of the neutron star s crust provides us ( at least in principle ) with a handle on the associated physics .",
    "these observations have led to a renewed interest in neutron star seismology , and work addressing issues ranging from the crust equation of state  @xcite , to the role of the magnetic field ( and the coupling to the fluid core )  @xcite and even the relevance of the superfluid neutrons that permeate the nuclear lattice at densities beyond neutron drip  @xcite .",
    "a similar breakthrough is hinted at by the observed cooling rate of the compact remnant in cassiopeia a. the data provides clear evidence for the presence of superfluid neutrons in the star s core ( associated with additional cooling due to the cooper pair breaking mechanism ) , leading to a constraint on the superfluid transition temperature  @xcite .",
    "this constrains the theoretical models , which depend crucially on many - body interactions at extreme densities .",
    "combined , the information gleaned about the crust region and the superfluid core provides us with a clear motivation to improve our seismology models accordingly .",
    "this is not a trivial task , but considerable progress has been made on the key aspects , realistic models would now seem to be within reach .",
    "the work reported in this paper takes a serious step towards the modelling of real neutron star seismology .",
    "our effort should be considered in the context of previous work , such as  @xcite and  @xcite who accounted for the crust elasticity and finite temperature effects , the modelling of superfluid dynamics by ( for example )  @xcite and most recently  @xcite and  @xcite in newtonian gravity and  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite in the framework of general relativity , and finally the effort aimed at including the magnetic field ( obviously a key aspect for magnetars ! )  @xcite .",
    "these studies provide key insights into the individual pieces of physics , but do not combine them .",
    "it is obviously desirable to do so , and the present work takes important steps in this direction .",
    "we consider the oscillations of a neutron star model with an elastic crust permeated by superfluid neutrons and a fluid core with two dynamically distinct components .",
    "we develop , and implement , the relevant conditions at the interface between these two regions .",
    "we do not , however , account for the magnetic field .",
    "neither do we ( fully ) account for thermal effects or consider the problem in general relativity .",
    "these are obvious shortcomings of our final model , especially since we can not meaningfully make use of a truly realistic equation of state unless we work in relativistic gravity .",
    "however , our model still represents the state - of - the - art for the coupled multi - fluid - elastic aspects and the analysis provides valuable insights that will assist future developments in this problem area .",
    "we want to build a neutron star model that accounts for the degrees of freedom associated with the crust elasticity and the superfluid components , both in the crust region and in the core .",
    "it is well - known that this involves modelling the core as a two - fluid system , with the superfluid neutron being treated as distinct from a charge - neutral conglomerate of protons and electrons .",
    "if the latter components are strictly co - moving , and we ignore issues associated with superconductivity and the presence of magnetic fluxtubes  @xcite , then we may ignore magnetic field effects altogether .",
    "this is obviously not a true representation of a neutron star core , which should be magnetized , but the model is nevertheless useful as it allows us to explore the relevance of the additional degree of freedom implied by superfluidity .      in the outer core of a neutron star ,",
    "we expect superfluid neutrons and superconducting protons to be present .",
    "meanwhile , in the inner crust , at densities above the neutron drip threshold , a fraction of neutrons are superfluid and coexist with the lattice of heavy nuclei . as we approach the neutron drip density , these `` free '' neutrons disappear and all the constituents of the crust are bound in nuclei .",
    "a two `` fluid '' formalism is sufficient to describe these key aspect of neutron star dynamics , but we have to carefully consider the nature of each component in the crust and in the core . in the core",
    "it is natural to distinguish the superfluid neutrons ( denoted by n in the following ) from a conglomerate of charged particles ( protons / electrons , denoted by p ) .",
    "the distinction in the inner crust is not quite so obvious , see the discussion by  @xcite . in this case",
    ", we consider the dynamics of baryons confined in the nuclei ( denoted by c ) permeated by a gas of free superfluid neutrons ( represented by f ) .    with these definitions ,",
    "the component fractions of the crust and the core are in general discontinuous at the crust / core interface , even if the total number of neutrons and protons is continuous .",
    "therefore , the choice of junction conditions at the crust / core transition is very important for the oscillation dynamics of the star .",
    "the dynamics of a two - component star are governed by mass and momentum conservation equations for each constituent , together with the poisson equation for the gravitational potential  @xcite .",
    "the conservation equations take the form : @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , the constituent and the relative velocities , while @xmath4 represents the chemical potential ( we will assume that the neutron and proton masses are equal , i.e. , we take @xmath5 ) .",
    "the mass densities are defined by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the constituent number density .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath8 obeys the poisson equation , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total mass density . in the interest of economy we will , whenever we write down an equation that describes both the dynamics in the core and the crust , imply that the two crust components have x either `` c '' or `` f '' . in the core , these constituent indices should be replaced by `` p '' and `` n '' and the shear modulus should obviously be set to zero .    to complete the dynamical equations , we need to provide the quantity @xmath11 , that accounts for the entrainment , and the `` external '' force density @xmath12 that acts on each fluid component .",
    "as we will see later , the force can be used to account for the crust elasticity ( and , in general , also the magnetic field ) . finally , the system of equations is closed by an equation of state ( eos )",
    ". it can be described by an energy functional that ensures galilean invariance ; @xmath13 the chemical potential @xmath14 and the entrainment parameter @xmath11 are then determined from given in equation  ( 7 ) contains a typo . here",
    ", we provide in equation  ( [ eq : vareps ] ) the correct definition . ]",
    "@xmath15      let us first consider the equations that need to be solved in order to determine a non - rotating superfluid neutron star in dynamical and chemical equilibrium .",
    "we consider a static , nonrotating , background star in which matter is in @xmath16-equilibrium , which means that @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , we assume that the crust is unstrained , which means that the elasticity affects only the linear perturbations of the system . under these assumptions ,",
    "the star is described by the following equations : @xmath18 equation  ( [ eq : bg1 ] ) is obtained from the stationary euler equations , the @xmath16-equilibrium condition and the standard relation between the pressure and chemical potential @xmath19 .",
    "the system of equations  ( [ eq : bg1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : bg2 ] ) can be written as a single ordinary differential equation @xmath20 the background configuration is therefore completely determined once we choose an eos that provides a second relation between the mass density and the chemical potential .",
    "more details on the eoss used in this work are given below , in sec .",
    "[ sec : eos ] .      in order to model the dynamics of the crust , where the elastic restoring force depends on the deviation from the unstrained configuration",
    ", it is natural to turn to lagrangian perturbation theory . in the problem considered in this paper , the relevant perturbations are trivially related to the eulerian variations of the various quantities , but in the general ( rotating and possibly pre - strained ) case the lagrangian description becomes more involved .",
    "however , there has been recent progress in developing the required theory  @xcite , and we draw on these results in the following .",
    "in fact , our analysis provides the first application of the new formalism .    in the two - fluid situation ,",
    "it is natural to introduce a lagrangian displacement vector @xmath21 for each fluid component  @xcite . in order to describe the motion associated with these vectors ,",
    "we define the lagrangian perturbation of a general ( scalar or vector ) quantity @xmath22 along the vector field @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the eulerian perturbation of @xmath22 and @xmath26 denotes the lie derivative along @xmath23 .",
    "the dynamics of neutron star oscillations can be studied by linearising the system of equations  ( [ eq : mconv])-([eq : pois ] ) .",
    "the linearised mass conservation and poisson equations are then given by ; @xmath27 meanwhile , for non - rotating stars , the linearised momentum conservation equations take the form  @xcite @xmath28 where the elastic stress tensor is defined as @xmath29 the shear modulus is denoted by @xmath30 , and must not be confused with the chemical potential  ( [ eq : defmu ] ) . for nonrotating configurations in @xmath16-equilibrium , equations  ( [ eq : eul-1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : eul-2 ] ) assume the simpler form ;",
    "@xmath31 as noted earlier , equations  ( [ eq : eul-3 ] ) and  ( [ eq : eul-4 ] ) also describe the dynamics of the neutron star core provided we replace , respectively , the indices c and f with p and n , and set @xmath32 to zero .      in the inner neutron star crust",
    ", the protons and a sizeable fraction of the neutrons are bound by the strong interaction .",
    "they form a lattice of nuclei that become heavier towards the crust / core transition , and which supports elastic stresses .",
    "the remaining fraction of ( unbound ) neutrons form a superfluid that may flow through the confined nucleons .",
    "this superfluid component first appears at the neutron drip density , @xmath33 , which marks the transition between the inner and outer crust , where there are no free neutrons .    in the inner crust",
    "there are , at least , two dynamical degrees of freedom ; a confined component of protons and neutrons and the free superfluid neutrons . however , the distinction between superfluid and confined neutrons is not obvious .",
    "it depends on the local density and the dynamical time - scale of the process under consideration . adopting the operational definition due to  @xcite",
    ", a neutron may be considered free when ( on the time - scale considered ) its energy is sufficient to overcome the potential barriers separating the nuclei , either classically or by quantum tunnelling . at the bottom of the crust , where the nuclei become denser and form exotic structure ( the so - called pasta phase ) , the potential wells become closer and",
    "marginally bound states may exist .",
    "these states may penetrate the potential barriers on time - scales that are macroscopically long ( but cosmologically short ) , see  @xcite for discussion .    within the two - fluid formalism , this uncertainty may be expressed in terms of the chemical gauge parameter @xmath34 introduced by  @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are , respectively , the number density of the free neutrons and the confined component , while @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the number densities of neutrons and protons .",
    "one can show that the neutron conjugate momentum and the chemical potential are independent of the chemical gauge choice  @xcite as long as @xmath40 is either held fixed or depends only on the nuclear charge number @xmath41 .",
    "this gauge independence is important for the derivation of the crust / core junction conditions .    in order to study the oscillations of a given neutron star model ,",
    "we must prescribe boundary conditions at the star s origin and surface . in a model with a crust",
    ", we must also specify conditions at the crust / core interface and at the outer / inner crust transition . in this work ,",
    "we implement the static limit of the crust / core conditions derived by  @xcite .",
    "from the mass conservation equations , we obtain the conditions for the radial component of the lagrangian displacements at @xmath42 : @xmath43 as in the single fluid case the other junction conditions may be derived from the total momentum conservation equation , which leads to the following vertical and horizontal projections  @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the ( flat ) metric , @xmath46 is a unit vector orthogonal to the crust / core interface and @xmath47 denotes the change of a physical quantity across the interface . equations  ( [ eq : tr1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : tr2 ] ) reduce to the standard traction conditions in the single fluid case .",
    "finally , from the chemical gauge independence we can determine the condition for the chemical potential of the superfluid neutron components ; @xmath48 from the junction condition  ( [ eq : bc1 ] ) , it is clear that for nonrotating models in @xmath16-equilibrium equation  ( [ eq : bcmu ] ) is equivalent to @xmath49 .",
    "these conditions complete the description of the problem that needs to be solved in order to determine that star s oscillation spectrum ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : polbc ] for the inner / outer crust boundary conditions ) .",
    "in order to make maximal use of the theoretical framework , we ought to build our models using a realistic equation of state for supranuclear matter .",
    "we will , however , resort to using a simple model eos .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "most importantly , we do not yet have a realistic eos that provides all the different parameters required in our analysis .",
    "most tabulated eos simply provide the pressure vs density relation , whereas we need ( at the very least ) detailed information about the composition , the superfluid pairing gaps and the entrainment between neutrons and protons .",
    "progress in this direction is being made , c.f .",
    ",  @xcite , but the models are not yet complete .",
    "still , the developments have reached the point where it would be meaningful to consider a fully relativistic analysis ( as is needed to make the use of a realistic eos meaningful ) .",
    "this is , however , beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "our main interest here is to probe the key issues and consider the associated phenomenology . for this exercise it makes sense to focus on a simple analytic model with freely adjustable parameters .",
    "we model the neutron star matter in terms of two polytropic eoss . despite the simplicity of the construction ,",
    "combinations of polytropes enable us to study the effects of composition stratification and symmetry energy on the oscillation spectrum . moreover",
    ", we have already used these eoss in previous work  @xcite , which means that we can build on , and compare to , the previous results . as a new application of the polytropic eos , we construct stratified two - fluid models with different parameters in the crust and the core in order to approximate the qualitatively different compositions in these two regions .    in most astrophysical systems",
    "the relative velocity between the two fluids is small .",
    "therefore , equation  ( [ eq : eos ] ) can be expanded in a series : @xmath50 this approximation has the advantage that the bulk eos , @xmath51 , and the entrainment parameter , @xmath52 , can be independently specified at @xmath53 . from equation  ( [ eq : vareps ] )",
    "it follows that the entrainment parameter @xmath54 is related to the function @xmath52 by @xmath55 in a co - moving background , the density perturbations can be expressed in terms of the chemical potential perturbations as : @xmath56 where @xmath57      given the above relations , we need to first of all provide the energy @xmath58 .",
    "the first eos we consider has also been used by  : @xmath59 } { x_{\\mathrm c}\\left [   1-\\left ( 1 + \\sigma_{sym } \\right ) x_{\\mathrm c}\\right ] } \\rho_{\\mathrm c}^2 \\label{eq : eosa } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath60 is a polytropic constant , @xmath61 is the confined nucleon fraction and @xmath62 is a parameter that can be related to the symmetry energy  . in this eos , both @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "are taken to be constant  @xcite . using equation  ( [ eq : sdef ] ) and ( [ eq : eosa ] )",
    ", we readily obtain @xmath63 as discussed by  @xcite , this eos leads to non - stratified stellar models .",
    "the global properties of these models are similar to those of the @xmath64 polytrope in the single fluid case .",
    "for instance , the pressure is related to the total mass density by the standard equation @xmath65 .",
    "the set of models constructed from this eos will be referred to as models a , c.f . @xcite .    at this point , it is useful to pause and make some comments on the numerical implementation and the resultant stellar models . in our numerical code , we use dimensionless units based on the gravitational constant @xmath66 , the central mass density @xmath67 and the stellar radius @xmath68 . unless directly specified , all models a considered in this paper are such that the crust / core transition is at @xmath69 . therefore , from the expected crust / core transition density @xmath70  , we can determine the central mass density of the star . at @xmath71",
    "the dimensionless mass density is @xmath72 , hence @xmath73 .",
    "meanwhile , the dimensionless mass of models a is @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the physical mass and the radius can also be determined .",
    "for instance , in the case of the canonical neutron star mass , @xmath75 , we obtain the radius @xmath76 .",
    "it is obviously not the case that the component fractions are constant in a real neutron star .",
    "we can account for composition gradients by considering another simple combination of polytropes ; @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are constants .",
    "this eos does not have the symmetry energy term , but it can leads to models with varying composition when @xmath80 . from equations  ( [ eq : defmu ] ) and  ( [ eq : eospr ] ) it follows that the chemical potential and the corresponding mass density are related by @xmath81 where the polytropic index is given by @xmath82 . from this result",

    "in this paper we have studied the effects of an elastic crust on the oscillation spectrum of superfluid neutron stars .",
    "building on recent results for the perturbations of two - fluid systems with both elasticity and superfluidity  @xcite , we considered newtonian models of mature neutron stars .",
    "the stellar core was modelled as a mixture of superfluid neutrons and a conglomerate of charged particles , while the inner crust was described by a lattice of nuclei permeated by a gas of free superfluid neutrons .",
    "focussing on nonrotating superfluid stars , we studied for the first time the effects of elasticity , entrainment and composition stratification on both shear modes and acoustic modes .",
    "our results show that the superfluid neutrons in the crust may have considerable impact on the star s spectrum .",
    "the superfluid component clearly can not be neglected if we want to determine an accurate oscillation spectrum of mature neutron stars .",
    "if we compare stellar models with and without superfluid neutrons in the crust , the difference between the shear mode frequencies is very large , but becomes smaller ( about 10% ) when we consider a `` realistic '' effective neutron mass .",
    "a superfluid component in the crust affects also the frequency of the superfluid acoustic modes , which are mainly dominated by a counter - phase motion between the two matter constituents .",
    "these superfluid modes are very sensitive to the composition difference between the core and the crust , and to the crust thickness .",
    "ordinary acoustic modes , in which the stellar constituents oscillate mainly in phase , are less affected by the presence of the crust .",
    "however , the spectrum of ordinary modes becomes more complex when we consider stellar models with composition stratification and more `` realistic '' entrainment .",
    "the spectrum exhibits avoided crossings between superfluid and ordinary pressure modes due to the chemical interaction between the co- and counter - moving degrees of freedom . furthermore , for some specific stellar models we have found that a large effective mass may affect also the frequency of the ordinary f - mode at the 10% level .",
    "the results presented in this paper are important as they represent the first analysis of the polar modes of the coupled elastic superfluid system , complementing previous work on the corresponding axial mode problem .",
    "our understanding of the latter problem remains more detailed , as it has also been considered in general relativity .",
    "this is important since one must work in the context of relativity in order to be able to consider realistic neutron star equations of state in a meaningful way .",
    "the results we have presented were obtained for `` relatively '' simple , more phenomenological , stellar models .",
    "these models have the advantage that one can explore the dependence on the key parameters , e.g. , the composition , but they are obviously not `` realistic '' .",
    "nevertheless , the insights gained from the analysis provide useful guidelines for developing and testing fully relativistic models in the future .",
    "the state - of - play as far as such developments are concerned is that the required linear perturbation framework is complete and ready to be used in various applications of astrophysical interest  @xcite .",
    "this step is , obviously , non - trivial but we expect to make progress in the near future . in order to make these models truly realistic",
    ", there also needs to be progress on various equation of state issues .",
    "we need more detailed models for the superfluid entrainment and the related effective masses , especially in the crust region .",
    "further work in this direction should certainly be encouraged .",

    "<S> we study the effects of an elastic crust on the oscillation spectrum of superfluid neutron stars . within the two fluid formalism </S>",
    "<S> , we consider newtonian stellar models that include the relevant constituents of a mature neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> the core is formed by a mixture of superfluid neutrons and a conglomerate of charged particles , while the inner crust is described by a lattice of nuclei permeated by superfluid neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> we linearise the poisson and the conservation equations of nonrotating superfluid stars and study the effects of elasticity , entrainment and composition stratification on the shear and acoustic modes . in both the core and the crust , </S>",
    "<S> the entrainment is derived from recent results for the nucleon effective mass . solving the perturbation equations as an eigenvalue problem </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the presence of superfluid neutrons in the crust and their large effective mass may have significant impact on the star s oscillation spectrum .    </S>",
