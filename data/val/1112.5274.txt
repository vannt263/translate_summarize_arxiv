    "the renormalization group theory ( rg ) theory@xcite predicts the value @xmath2 for the upper critical dimensionality of the @xmath3-component lattice scalar - field theory and of the short - range classical heisenberg @xmath3-component spin systems with @xmath4-symmetric interaction . when @xmath5 , the critical fluctuations become too weak to drive the leading critical exponents away from the `` classical '' values taken in the mean field ( mf ) approximation , and can only induce minor corrections to scaling . in particular , in 4d the simple mf asymptotic forms of the thermodynamical quantities at criticality should be corrected by logarithmic factors ,",
    "whose precise structure is also predicted by the rg . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the dominant singularities have purely mf forms and the fluctuations can only influence the critical amplitudes and the corrections to scaling .",
    "these rg predictions entail the `` triviality''@xcite of the quantum @xmath3-component scalar - field theories in @xmath6 , or , more precisely , the property that the continuum ( scaling ) limit of the lattice approximation of the theories ( or of the spin models ) describes fields whose connected fourth- and higher - order correlation - functions vanish and therefore are free or generalized - free .",
    "the main clues of this no - interaction property had been pointed out long ago@xcite , but more stringent arguments were produced only by the modern developments of the rg theory@xcite . in the same years , a rigorous constructive approach@xcite based on the representation@xcite of the lattice scalar - field as a gas of polymers , made it possible to prove conclusively that the continuum euclidean quantum field theory , built as the scaling limit of a lattice theory ( with the simplest nearest - neighbor discretization of the laplacian ) in the symmetric phase , is `` non - trivial''@xcite in @xmath7 and `` trivial '' in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "the rigorous results that exist in 4d ( and , in general , for @xmath9 ) are still incomplete , although they strongly suggest that nevertheless the triviality property still holds .",
    "therefore some room is left not only to numerical studies , but also to a variety of efforts@xcite ( and the related controversies@xcite ) , aimed either to exploit possible gaps in the arguments , or to relax some of the hypotheses underlying the constructive approach , in order to make the definition of a `` non - trivial '' continuum theory feasible .    for @xmath5",
    ", the montecarlo ( mc ) simulation approach to the numerical verification of the rg predictions is not yet completely satisfactory .",
    "the detailed exploration of the near - critical behavior is hampered by the necessity of considering systems of very large sizes , and in particular , at @xmath10 , by the difficulty of an accurate characterization of the slowly varying logarithmic deviations from mf behavior .",
    "for @xmath5 , also the finite - size - scaling theory and the confluent corrections to scaling have been debated@xcite .",
    "thus relatively few of the numerous available mc studies@xcite are likely to be extensive enough to yield a satisfactory overall description of these systems at criticality , in spite of the remarkable progress in the simulation algorithms with reduced critical slowdown .",
    "on the other hand , for these systems high - temperature ( ht ) expansions have been until now derived only for a small number of observables and are too short@xcite , or perhaps barely adequate@xcite to extract reliable information in the critical region .",
    "we believe however , that the ht series methods might bring further insight into this context , provided that for a conveniently enlarged set of observables , the lengths of the expansions can be significantly extended . recently",
    ", new stochastic algorithms@xcite have shown promise of deriving extremely long , although approximate , ht expansions valid for finite - size lattice systems .",
    "the application@xcite of these methods also to the triviality problem is particularly interesting .",
    "the traditional graphical @xcite or iterative@xcite methods of calculation , although severely limited by the fast increase of their combinatorial complexity with the order of expansion , remain necessary to derive the exact ht series coefficients , valid in the thermodynamical limit , which are needed for a reliable use of the known analytic extrapolation tools@xcite , such as pad approximants(pa ) or differential approximants ( da ) .",
    "it is finally worth adding that , in the case of high - dimensional models , these exact ht expansions still seem to be the only practicable method to compute the higher - order field - derivatives of the free energy at zero field , usually called `` higher susceptibilities '' .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the ht series approach to provide further numerical evidence supporting the rg predictions in the case of the @xmath11 lattice scalar - field models and of the ising spin-@xmath1 systems . for this purpose ,",
    "we have computed and analyzed exact ht expansions of the higher susceptibilities , through order 24 , to study their critical behavior and an important class of universal combinations of critical amplitudes ( uccas ) , whose properties might also be of interest .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we define the spin-@xmath1 ising and the lattice scalar - field systems for which we have substantially extended the ht expansions of the specific free - energy in the presence of a uniform magnetic field .",
    "then we make due reference to the few ht data already in the literature . in section iii , we introduce the higher susceptibilities and indicate how their expected critical behavior varies with the lattice dimensionality . in section iv , we review the definition of the dimensionless @xmath12-points renormalized coupling constants in terms of the higher susceptibilities and indicate their role in the discussion of the rg predictions .",
    "then we introduce several classes of uccas related to the latter quantities .",
    "the following section v is devoted to a detailed numerical analysis of our ht expansions including discussions of numerical estimates of the critical temperatures , exponents and several uccas for the models under scrutiny .",
    "the final section contains our conclusions .",
    "in what follows , we shall be concerned only with spin-@xmath1 ising or one - component lattice scalar - fields , so that , unless explicitly needed , it will be convenient to drop the dependence of the physical quantities on the number @xmath3 of components of the spin or of the field .    in a bounded region @xmath13 of the @xmath14-dimensional lattice @xmath15",

    "[ ] , for @xmath5 , the hbcc lattices are defined as those in which the first neighbors @xmath37 of the site @xmath38 are such that @xmath39 .",
    "this choice has the technical advantage , decisive for the computations on high dimensional lattices , that the `` lattice free - embedding numbers '' , that enter into the contribution of each graph to the ht expansion , factorize so that they can be expressed as powers of those referring to the 1d lattice . as a consequence of this drastic simplification ,",
    "the computing time of the expansions is independent of the lattice dimensionality , whereas , in the case of the hsc lattices , it grows exponentially with the dimensionality .",
    "we should also notice that , for @xmath40 , the coordination number @xmath41 of the hbcc lattice is much larger than the coordination number @xmath42 of the hsc lattice and therefore the hbcc lattice expansions share the advantage of being notably smoother and faster converging than the hsc ones .",
    "the expansions presented here are based on a calculation of the ht and low - field expansion of the free energy of various models described by the hamiltonians eqs.([isingesse ] ) and ( [ pdifi ] ) , in presence of an external uniform magnetic field , that we have extended through the order 24 . in the case of the conventional ising model ,",
    "i.e. the model with spin @xmath23 , such an expansion , through order 17 , was already in the literature@xcite in the case of the four - dimensional hsc lattice ( h4sc ) .",
    "our expansion agrees only up to order 16 with these data and , as a consequence , with the series coefficients of the ordinary susceptibility @xmath43 and of the fourth field - derivative of the free energy @xmath44 , obtained from them and analyzed in ref .",
    "[ ] , as well as in some successive studies . for the conventional ising model , in addition to the expansion in the case of the h4sc lattice , we have also computed the analogous expansion in the case of the hbcc lattice in 4d ( h4bcc ) . for both the h4sc and the h4bcc lattices , we have moreover computed ht and low - field expansions in the case of the ising models with spin @xmath45 and in the case of the euclidean one - component scalar - field lattice models with an even - polynomial self - interaction .",
    "we have finally repeated the series derivation for the same set of models in 5d and 6d , but restricting ourselves to the five - dimensional hbcc ( h5bcc ) and the six - dimensional hbcc ( h6bcc ) lattices , for the reasons of computational simplification indicated above .",
    "all these expansions do not exist in the literature .",
    "altogether , we have examined these ising - type models in 28 cases distinct by spatial dimensionality , value of the spin and structure of the lattice or of the interaction . in a given dimension",
    ", all these models are expected to belong to the same critical universality class and therefore to be characterized by the same set of critical exponents and uccas .",
    "finally , let us also mention that our ht expansions for the ising models in a magnetic field can be readily transformed into low - temperature ( lt ) and high - field expansions , from which the spontaneous magnetization and the lt higher susceptibilities can be derived .    in our calculation of the ht expansions ,",
    "we have employed the linked - cluster graphical method of ref .",
    "we have used an algorithm of graph generation and series calculation already described in ref . [ ] .",
    "the details of the computer implementation of this procedure , its validation , and its performance are discussed in the same paper , that was devoted to a study of the higher susceptibilities and the scaling equation of state for the 3d ising universality class .",
    "our extensions of the ht and low field expansions are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the set of series coefficients can not fit into this paper because of its large size and will be tabulated elsewhere .",

    "no logarithmic factors are expected to modify the leading mf behavior of the physical quantities , so that our approximation tools are likely to yield estimates of a higher accuracy , which moreover appear to improve with increasing lattice dimensionality , both because of the decreasing size of the corrections to scaling and of the increasing lattice coordination number .",
    "all these results are confirmed also by the analyses employing das .    only in the case of the ising model with spin @xmath23 on the h4sc lattice",
    ", we can compare our estimates with those obtained in other studies by extrapolation of shorter ht series . in ref .",
    "[ ] the estimate @xmath192 was obtained from a series of order 17 , while in ref .",
    "[ ] the result @xmath193 was derived from a series of order 19 .",
    "as far as the most recent large - scale mc simulations are concerned , the estimate @xmath194 was obtained in ref .",
    "[ ] , the value @xmath195 in ref . [ ] , while the value @xmath196 is reported in ref .",
    "our result in table [ tabkc ] is fully consistent with the older estimates .",
    "no comparison is possible either for higher values of the spin on the h4sc lattice , or for any value of the spin on the h4bcc lattice , since no studies are available for these systems . in the case of the higher dimensional lattices our analysis includes only the h5bcc and h6bcc lattices , which have not been studied elsewhere until now .      also in the computation of the critical exponents , it is convenient to distinguish the 4d case from the higher dimensional ones .    in 4d , when computing the exponent @xmath197 of @xmath43 by pas or das , we obtain estimates very near to , but slightly larger than unity .",
    "these estimates should then be regarded as the values of `` effective exponents '' which reflect the presence of a small correction to the leading classical behavior ( and of subleading corrections ) . if we assume that the leading correction to mf behavior has the multiplicative logarithmic structure predicted by the rg , we can resort to a variety of procedures proposed@xcite in the literature to isolate the logarithmic factor from the main power behavior and to measure its exponent .",
    "these prescriptions generally amount to cancel out the main power - singularity in favor of the weak logarithmic one and therefore they need to be biased with an estimate of the inverse critical temperature , to which , in turn , the values obtained for the exponent of the logarithm are very sensitive .    for example , in the case of the ordinary susceptibility @xmath43 , one might study the auxiliary function @xmath198 defined by @xmath199 % = l(\\tilde   k_c ) + o({\\rm ln|ln}\\tau| ) ) \\label{glog}\\ ] ] where @xmath200 is some accurate approximation of the true @xmath181 . by eq.([2ncorras4 ] ) , @xmath201 , i.e. it yields the value of the exponent @xmath202 when @xmath110 and @xmath203 .",
    "since @xmath200 enters as a parameter into the definition of this biased indicator , we should consider how the estimate @xmath204 of the exponent depends on the choice of @xmath200 in a small vicinity of our best estimate of the critical inverse temperature reported in tabs.[tabkc ] or [ tabkcfi4 ] .",
    "as a typical example , we show in fig.[figesplog ] the plots of @xmath204 vs @xmath200 ( normalized to our mra estimate of @xmath205 ) , computed by pas of various orders , in the case of the ising model with spin @xmath206 on the h4bcc lattice .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the value of @xmath204 should depend slowly on @xmath200 near the exact value of the critical inverse temperature so that its best value might perhaps correspond to a stationary point .",
    "we observe that , for most pas of @xmath204 , such a point does indeed exist and also that the curves obtained by various pas touch nearby this point , which is generally not much different from our best estimate of @xmath181 as reported in our tables . in the literature@xcite , the value of @xmath204 at the point where the various curves touch , is generally taken as the most accurate estimate of the exponent @xmath202 .",
    "however , this choice may be questioned , since the result appears to be insensitive to the order of approximation .",
    "as shown in fig.[figesplog ] , if we take the value of @xmath204 at the stationary point as the best approximation , the estimates are also close to the expected value @xmath207 .",
    "unfortunately , also the choice of the stationary value as the best approximation is open to doubt , since in this case the successive approximations seem to worsen as the order of the series increases .",
    "we must moreover mention that , in the h4bcc ising system , the values of @xmath202 computed in this way , range between @xmath208 and @xmath209 , as the spin varies from @xmath23 to @xmath169 .",
    "finally , it is also unclear how to estimate the uncertainties involved in these procedures and thus how to interpret the spread of exponent estimates , which might be related to a strong spin - dependence of the slowly decaying corrections appearing in eq.([glog ] ) .",
    "other prescriptions to study the exponent of the logarithmic corrections , do not lead to better results .      for each model under study ,",
    "we have computed the exponent @xmath197 of the susceptibility by second- or third - order das biased with our estimate of the inverse critical temperature , namely by resorting to the standard prescription of imposing that the approximants are singular at the values of @xmath181 reported in our tables [ tabkc ] and [ tabkcfi4 ] and then computing the exponents .",
    "for @xmath89 , it is rigorously proved@xcite that the systems must exhibit a mf critical behavior ( with non trivial subleading corrections ) .",
    "let us discuss first how our numerical tools perform in the 5d and 6d cases .",
    "we shall then argue that the differences between the features of this computation and those of the 4d case can be simply ascribed to the expected presence of a multiplicative logarithmic correction to the dominant mf power behavior . in fig.[gamma456 ] , we have plotted our estimates of the exponent of the ordinary susceptibility vs the spin in the case of various spin-@xmath1 ising models for @xmath210 . for @xmath127 ,",
    "our estimates reproduce to a very good accuracy the expected value @xmath211 , so that the small deviations from this value can be safely viewed as only the residual effects of the confluent corrections to scaling .",
    "these deviations also show the expected decreasing size as the dimensionality of the system increases . moreover the critical universality , i.e. the independence of the exponents on the interaction structure , is well verified . on the contrary , at the upper critical dimension our calculations yield `` effective '' exponents larger than unity by @xmath212 .",
    "we can interpret this result as an indication that the leading critical singularity of the susceptibility is slightly stronger than a pure mf singularity so that it might indeed contain the logarithmic factor predicted by the rg , which is detected by the das as a power - like factor with a very small exponent .",
    "this is confirmed by observing that , if the expected logarithmic singularity is canceled by dividing out from the susceptibility the @xmath213 correction factor , the resulting estimate of the exponent @xmath197 generally gets within @xmath214 of the mf value .",
    "thus the deviations are reduced to a smaller size and become compatible with the effects of the corrections to scaling .",
    "very accurate estimates can be obtained also for the differences @xmath215 between the exponents of @xmath216 and @xmath217 @xmath218 they can be computed from the ratios @xmath219 by second- or third - order das biased with the critical inverse temperature . in the 4d case , we should not expect any effects from the logarithmic factors appearing in the leading singular behavior eq.([2ncorras4 ] ) of the higher susceptibilities , since these factors cancel in the above indicated ratios . instead of the results of the biased prescription , we prefer to show here the estimates from a computation by the unbiased `` critical point renormalization '' method@xcite .",
    "this procedure consists in determining the difference @xmath215 of eq.([dn ] ) from the exponent of the singularity in @xmath220 of the series @xmath221 with coefficients @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the @xmath174-th coefficient of the expansion of @xmath224 .",
    "the biased da calculation of the @xmath215 , mentioned above , gives quite comparable results , so that it is not necessary to report the corresponding figures .",
    "the quantities @xmath215 with @xmath225 , obtained by the unbiased method in the case of the the scalar - field model on the h5bcc and h6bcc lattices , for several values of the coupling @xmath226 , are plotted vs @xmath86 in fig.[diffga_fi4h56bcc ] . the same computations for the spin-@xmath1 ising models with various values of the spin on the h5bcc and h6bcc lattices yield completely similar results and therefore we do not report the corresponding figure .",
    "our estimates of @xmath215 agree , generally within @xmath227 , with the expected value @xmath228 .",
    "thus the small size of these deviations from the mf value suggests that they can safely be related with the confluent corrections to scaling .",
    "the critical universality is also well verified . on the other hand ,",
    "our results in the 4d case reported in fig.[diffga_fi4h4bcc ] in the case of the scalar - field model on the h4bcc lattice , those reported in fig.[diffga_isi_h4bcc ] for the ising model on the h4bcc lattice and those of fig.[diffga_isi_h4sc ] for the same system in the case of the h4sc lattice , show relative deviations from the value of @xmath229 , five times larger than those in @xmath89 dimensions ( i.e. of the order of @xmath230 ) , but still sufficiently small to reflect only the residual influence of the expected subleading logarithmic corrections to the critical behavior .      for @xmath89 , using second- or third - order das , the first few terms of the sequence of the uccas @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145",
    "can be evaluated to a good accuracy , by extrapolating to @xmath231 the estimates of the functions @xmath232 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 . for convenience , we have introduced the ratios of these quantities to their mf values , and denoted them by @xmath233 , @xmath234 and @xmath235 , respectively . in fig.[isuimfh56bcc ] , we have reported our estimates for the ratios @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath238 and @xmath239 vs the value @xmath1 of the spin for ising models on the h5bcc and h6bcc lattices . in complete agreement with the proven mf nature of the critical behavior , these ratios generally equal unity , within the accuracy expected from our approximations that , in this case , allows not only for the influence of the confluent corrections to scaling , but also for the uncertainties in the estimates of the critical temperatures needed to bias the calculations .",
    "correspondingly , the critical limits of the ratios @xmath124 vanish and the equation of state takes the mf form .",
    "quite similar results are shown in fig.[nuoveuccah56bcc ] for the other normalized uccas @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 which are plotted vs the spin @xmath1 for ising models with various values of the spin in the case of the h5bcc and h6bcc lattices .    also in the 4d case , as shown in fig.[i6i8suimf_fi4_h4sc_h4bcc ] for the first few uccas defined by eq.([watsoncr ] ) in the case of the scalar - field model , and in fig.[nuoveuccah4bcc ] for a few uccas defined by eqs.([watsonar ] ) and",
    "( [ watsonbr ] ) in the case of the spin-@xmath1 ising model , the various quantities probably have been evaluated with reasonable accuracy , because the logarithmic factors , expected to appear in the leading critical behavior of the higher susceptibilities , cancel in the ratios defining the uccas . as a consequence , the uncertainties in the critical temperatures and the influence of the corrections to scaling",
    "should still be considered as the main sources of error .",
    "however , we observe that generally the first few ratios @xmath233 , @xmath244 and @xmath245 are slightly , but definitely smaller than unity .",
    "we can imagine two possible explanations of this result : either the deviations from unity have to be related only to ( unlikely ) residual effects of the logarithms in the leading and subleading behavior of the higher susceptibilities , or the uccas are accurately estimated and they really do not take their mf values .",
    "whatever the case , it is clear that also these data on the uccas confirm that , consistently with the rg predictions , the critical behavior in 4d is not mf - like .",
    "by analyzing our ht expansions of the zero - field higher - susceptibilities , extended through order 24 , in the case of the @xmath11 lattice scalar - field models and of the spin-@xmath1 ising systems , we have provided further numerical evidence consistent with the critical behavior predicted by the rg in this class of models .",
    "we have estimated the critical exponents of the ordinary and the higher susceptibilities and the values of a class of universal combinations of their critical amplitudes , which determine the form of the critical equation of state and are presently inaccessible by other computational methods . in 4d",
    ", the results of our analysis suggest that , within a good approximation , the critical exponents and this class of uccas , show small , but definitely nonvanishing deviations from their values in the mf approximation . for the uccas , this fact had been already predicted long ago also within the rg formalism , by showing@xcite that , at the upper critical dimension , at least one of the quantities in the above mentioned class does not take the mf value .",
    "more generally , in 4d the deviations from the mf critical behavior are compatible with the small effects associated to the logarithmic corrections predicted by the rg .",
    "our direct numerical checks concerning in particular the exponents of the logarithmic corrections to the dominant power behavior of the higher susceptibilities have only a rather limited accuracy , due to the modest sensitivity of the das to the logarithmic singularities , either in the leading behaviors and in the confluent corrections .",
    "quite on the contrary , the same kind of analysis performed on five- and six - dimensional lattices , shows no numerical evidence of deviations from the leading classical behavior by an extent larger than the expected numerical uncertainties : both the exponents and the uccas appear to take the mf values within a high approximation , so that the rg predictions concerning the triviality property are rather convincingly confirmed .",
