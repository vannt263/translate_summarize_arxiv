    ", two neutrons simultaneously undergo beta decay producing two protons , two electrons and two anti - neutrinos in the final state .",

    "observation of @xmath13 would provide evidence for lepton number violation , majorana nature of neutrinos  @xcite and can result in a measurement of the effective neutrino mass .",
    "the important implications of @xmath13 and recent demonstration of neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite have triggered a new generation of experiments using a variety of candidate isotopes with different experimental techniques  @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath13 process mediated via the exchange of a light massive majorana neutrino , the decay rate is related to the effective majorana neutrino mass through the nuclear transition matrix element ( ntme ) .",

    "these studies can provide inputs to the calculations of ntme for the process , thereby reducing the uncertainty in the effective neutrino mass .",
    "further , the difference between the decays to the different states of the final nuclei can be used to constrain / study the other possible mechanisms of @xmath13 such as exchange of right - handed w - bosons or of supersymmetry ( susy ) models with r - parity violation  @xcite .",
