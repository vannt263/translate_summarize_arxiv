    "global modeling of the solar wind ( sw ) interaction with the local interstellar medium ( lism ) is essential : ( 1 ) in general , to understand how the sun acts as a star and exchanges matter and energy with the lism , and ( 2 ) in particular , to explain relevant space experiment data ( e.g. obtained on board of both _",

    "this is very important for analyses of any measurements ( direct or indirect ) of h atoms .    to obtain an effective tool to calculate the h atom space and velocity distribution inside the heliosphere ,",

    "this distribution function is used as a boundary condition for the second step in which the velocity distribution inside the heliosphere is calculated with the resolution ( in time , space , and velocity space ) required for the data analyses .",
    "the kinetic equation at this step is solved using the method of characteristics in 3d time - dependent case ( izmodenov et al . , 2013 ) .",

    "1999 ) , we do not take it into account here for the following two reasons .",

    "this is simply the model that was published previously ( izmodenov et al . 2005b , 2009 ) but with updated lism boundary conditions . in model 2 , we take into account the hmf , while the sw is still assumed to be spherically symmetric .",
    "model 3 takes into account both the hmf and the heliolatitudinal variations of the sw .",
    "to finish the formulation of the problem , the inner boundary conditions in the unperturbed ( by lism ) sw and the outer boundary conditions in the pristine lism should be formulated .",
    "it is important to note that the boundary conditions considered in this paper are stationary .",
    "therefore , this paper focuses on the stationary solutions of the sw / lism interaction problem .",

    "the reasons for such a reduction are discussed in section 4 .",

    "therefore , corresponding heliolatitudinal variations of the sw temperature are applied ( variations are about @xmath72 ) .",

    "also , in the frame of the ideal mhd equation , we are not interested in the structure of the heliospheric current sheet assuming that it is a discontinuity where the magnetic field changes its orientation . this assumption has been confirmed so far by _ voyager _ magnetic field measurements in the sw and in the inner heliosheath ( e.g. , burlaga & ness 2012 ) that demonstrate a quick change of the magnetic field orientation rather than a thick ( comparing to the size of the heliosheath ) transition region .",

    "also , the numerical solution has been tested on the extended grids where the computational domain was increased up to two times . in particular , the tail region for model 3 varied in these calculations from 1000 au up to 5500 au .    kinetic equation ( 1 ) for the h - atom component has been solved using a monte carlo method with spatial splitting of the particle trajectories ( malama , 1991 ) .",
    "monte carlo calculations have been performed using the same computational grid as described above for the plasma component .",
    "since the ts and heliopause are the grid surfaces , we can define different populations of h atoms through their dependence on their place of origin ( see , e.g. , malama 1991 ; baranov et al .",
    "optimization of the critical weights in the monte carlo method has been performed separately for the each of the four populations ( malama 1990 ) .",

    "visual comparison of the results shows that the hmf does not qualitatively change the global structure of the interaction region .",
    "the geometrical patterns and distributions of the plasma density and magnetic field look quite similar , especially outside of the heliopause .",
    "however , it can clearly be seen that the heliospheric ts is about @xmath110 au closer to the sun in model 2 compared to model 1 .",
    "this effect is quantitatively seen in figure 4 , which shows one - dimensional ( 1d ) distributions of the plasma and magnetic field in the direction of the z - axis , i.e. toward the vector of the interstellar flow or in the upwind direction . in the upwind direction ( and in the entire region close to the sw stagnation point that is shifted south of x=0 ) , the heliosphere is located at the same distances for models 1 and 2 . however , the further one moves from the upwind region , the larger the difference between the hp distances in models 1 and 2 . in the crosswind (",
    "i.e. , in the direction of positive x ) the hp is about 100 au further in model 1 than in model 2 .",
    "this effect could be explained by a plasma depletion layer around the heliopause .",
    "the effect of plasma depletion in the vicinity of contact discontinuities is known for the magnetospheres ( e.g. , zwan & wolf 1976 ) .",
    "the effect is connected with an increase in the perpendicular component of the magnetic field when plasma approaches the contact boundary ( cranfill - axford effect for the heliosphere ) .",
    "the gradient of the magnetic field forces plasma to decelerate and flow around of the magnetic  wall \" obstacle .",
    "this effect can clearly be seen in figure 4 where the 1d distributions of the plasma and magnetic field parameters are shown for the upwind direction .",
    "all three components of the hmf increase toward the heliopause ( plots ( i),(j ) , and ( k ) in figure 4 ) .",
    "the plasma velocity components ( plots ( e),(f ) , and ( g ) ) and density ( plot ( a ) ) decrease from the middle of the inner heliosheath to the heliopause . in the same region , both the alfvenic number and plasma beta become less than 1 , i.e. , the flow is determined by the magnetic field .",
    "the effect of sw plasma density depletion around the heliopause can clearly be seen from the comparison of plasma density isolines in models 1 and 2 ( compare panels ( a ) and ( b ) in figure 3 ) .",
    "magnetic field pressure replaces the plasma pressure in such a way that the total pressure is conserved ( plot ( b ) in figure 4 ) .",
    "this conclusion is valid for quite a wide region around the heliopause .",
    "however , because less plasma flows along the heliopause from the stagnation region to the flanks , some deficit of pressure appears at the flanks and the heliopause there moves toward the sun . this explains why the heliopause in model 2 has a slightly different ( from model 1 ) shape and is closer to the sun in the crosswind and tail .",
    "it is interesting to note that a sharp and strong jump of density at the heliopause exists in model 2 .",
    "this somewhat contradicts the belov and ruderman ( 2010 ) result for the smooth transition at the heliopause due to the charge - exchange effect .",
    "we explain this by the fact that the effect does not work in 3d geometry since the stagnation points are in different places inside and outside the heliopause .",
    "we also note that we discuss the plasma depletion from the inner side of the heliopause .",
    "a similar effect of plasma depletion should be pronounced from the outside of the heliopause , as discussed in fuselier & cairns ( 2013 ) .",
    "we do not see the effect in the model because the interstellar h atoms strongly influence ( due to charge exchange ) the interstellar plasma flow around the heliopause .",
    "however , some small decrease of the plasma density that is observed in figure 4(a ) at the outer side of the heliopause could be associated with the plasma depletion .",
    "the effect of the magnetic increase ( or magnetic wall ) around the heliopause ( plot ( d ) in figure 3 ) and the plasma depletion leads to quite significant displacement of the heliospheric ts toward the sun . this can be seen in figure 4(b ) . in model 2 ,",
    "the ts is @xmath111 au closer to the sun compared with model 1 .",
    "such a displacement of the ts is probably the major effect of the hmf on the global structure of the heliosphere .    despite the fact that the geometrical pattern of the sw / lism interaction region does not change dramatically",
    ", the hmf significantly influences the sw plasma flow . to illustrate this , we present the distribution of the plasma velocity and magnetic field along the heliopause ( figure 5 ) . in this figure",
    ", the heliopause is projected onto a ( projection ) plane as follows .",
    "the origin of the coordinate system of this plane coincides with the intersection of the heliopause with the z - axis .",
    "polar coordinates ( @xmath97 , @xmath83 ) in this plane are defined in such a way that the polar angle @xmath83 coincides with the polar angle in the ( xy ) plane .",
    "the radial distance @xmath97 coincides with the length of the curve that is obtained at the intersection of the heliopause and the plane containing the z - axis and determined by constant @xmath83 angle in the ( xy ) plane .",
    "note that the ( _ bv _ ) plane ( i.e. , zx plane ) corresponds to the horizontal line @xmath98 in the projection plane . for model 1 ,",
    "the plasma flow pattern is symmetric around this line because the ( zx ) plane is the plane of the symmetry in this model .",
    "this is not the case for model 2 .",
    "the main symmetry is observed around line @xmath83 = 42.4@xmath99 .",
    "this line is defined by the angle between the solar equatorial plane and the ( _ bv _ ) plane .",
    "therefore , the sw plasma flow pattern in the heliosheath ( and , specifically , at the heliopause ) is determined by the direction of the solar rotation axis rather than by the directions of the interstellar flow and magnetic field vectors . it can be seen ( panel ( b ) in figure 5 ) that the sw velocity is smaller in the equatorial plane and the streamlines directed toward the poles . some asymmetries with respect to the plane of @xmath83 = 42.4@xmath99",
    "are observed in the figure .",
    "this is due to the asymmetric shape of the heliopause distorted by the ismf .",
    "however , these `` interstellar '' induced features are much less pronounced than the `` sun - connected '' symmetry of the flow .",
    "the same types of symmetries / asymmetries are also observed in the distribution of the hmf along the heliopause ( panel ( c ) of figure 5 ) .    as opposed to the inner side of the heliopause , in the interstellar medium ,",
    "the plasma and magnetic field distributions look very similar in models 1 and 2 ( panels ( d)-(f ) in figure 5 ) .",
    "small differences in panels ( d ) and ( e ) are caused by the differences in the heliopause shape in models 1 and 2 .",
    "before we move forward to discuss the results obtained in the context of model 3 , it is worthwhile to mention the very recent publication by opher et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , where it was pointed out that the hmf tension - force in the inner heliosheath leads to the formation of two sw flux jets directed north and south .",
    "furthermore , this tension force changes the topology of the heliopause , making it a more tube - like structure ( see , also ,   * axisymmetric model by * drake et al .",
    "2015 ) as compared to our sheet - like structure .",
    "the model by opher et al .",
    "( 2015 ) assumes a unipolar magnetic field , as in our model 2 .",
    "therefore , the effects of magnetic tension in the heliosheath can be seen in our model 2 . in order to explore these effects , we plot ( figure 6 ) the solar flux ( @xmath100 ) in a projection on a closed surface that it located in the inner heliosheath .",
    "the surface has been constructed by adding a fixed distance to the ts distance in any given direction .",
    "the distance has been chosen as 39 au for model 1 and 50 au for model 2 .",
    "the difference in the distances chosen for models 1 and 2 is connected with the different widths of the inner heliosheath in the models .",
    "figure 6 presents the solar flux plotted for model 1 and model 2 . any point on the surface",
    "is characterized by two spherical angles @xmath75 and @xmath101 .",
    "the angle @xmath75 is counted from the z - axis ( i.e. , from the upwind direction ) , while the angle @xmath101 is counted from the x - axis in the xy plane .",
    "panel ( 1 ) in figure 6 demonstrates the sw mass flux in the case of model 1 when hmf is not taken into account .",
    "it is seen that the mass flux reaches its maximum for @xmath75 @xmath1100@xmath102 - 110@xmath102 and @xmath101@xmath1180@xmath102 .",
    "this nearly crosswind direction corresponds to the direction through which all of the solar mass flux from the upwind hemisphere passes into the tail .",
    "the maxima at @xmath101@xmath1180@xmath102 corresponds to that part of the ( _ bv _ ) plane where the distance between the ts and hp is minimal .",
    "conversely , panel ( 2 ) demonstrates that there are two mass - flux maxima ( i.e. jets ) in the north and south directions .",
    "these jets are clear results of the magnetic tension . therefore , in this respect ,",
    "our model results is in a qualitative agreement with the conclusion of opher et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .    however , the conclusion on the tube - like shape of the heliopause made by opher et al .",
    "( 2015 ) is not supported by our calculations .",
    "the exact reasons for this will be explored in future studies . here ,",
    "we speculate on two possibilities .",
    "the first is connected with effects of charge exchange of solar protons and interstellar h atoms . in the * axisymmetric * model of drake et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , * where the spherically symmetric sw flows into the unmagnetized lism resting with respect to the sun , the axis of symmetry is the north - south pole axis . due to the symmetry in any plane containing the axis of symmetry , there is a stagnation point at equator .",
    "therefore , in 3d space , * the stagnation line ( i.e. , the line of stagnation points ) at the heliopause is a circle in the solar - equatorial plane . since *",
    "the tube - like structure remains * in the case of opher et al .",
    "( 2015 ) when the relative sun / lism motion is taken into account , the stagnation line still exists , although it is deformed and not necessarily located in the equatorial plane .",
    "the interstellar h atoms penetrate into the stagnation line vicinity and begin charge exchange with the protons . as a result of the charge exchange",
    ", momentum is transferred from the h atom components into the plasma components .",
    "the momentum transfer results in a diminishing the heliocentric distance to the heliopause in the upwind side of the heliosphere .",
    "the effect is very well known for the traditional sheet - like heliosphere ( see , e.g. , figure 2 in izmodenov 2000 ) . in the tube - like heliosphere",
    ", the same momentum - transfer effect should result in the increase of the heliocentric distance to the heliopause in the downwind direction .",
    "the heliopause , in principle , could move further and further downwind , and so it can be treated as a sheet - like structure in the considered computational domain .",
    "* however , while the effect of charge exchange is , in principle , taken into account in the multi - fluid approach , * this effect should be verified by kinetic - mhd calculations . * as has been shown by alexashov and izmodenov ( 2005 ) , the multi - fluid and kinetic approaches may have qualitatively different results .",
    "*    another possible reason model 2 does not have the tube - like shape of the heliopause could be due to the fact that our computational grid explicitly assumes the sheet - like structure of the heliopause .",
    "however , if the formation of the two streams would physically result in the tube - like shape geometry of the heliopause , then at some specific locations ( where the sw mass flux becomes negligible ) the different parts of our `` sheet - like '' heliopause should approach each other . then",
    ", our computational grid should collapse and",
    "this would be an indication of the tube - like topology of the heliopause . however , the grid collapse is not observed in our calculations .",
    "therefore , we currently favor the first possibility , but the question of the topology of the heliopause is generally very interesting and should be explored in detail in the future .",
    "figure 7 presents the results obtained in the framework of model 3 where the latitudinal variations of the sw parameters have been taken into account in addition to the hmf .",
    "it can be seen that both the global structure of the heliosphere and the plasma and magnetic field distributions are qualitatively the same as for models 1 and 2 .",
    "however , the comparison of panel ( a ) in figure 7 with panel ( b ) in figure 3 shows that the heliopause is more blunt in model 3 .",
    "the heliopause is closer ( by about   @xmath110 - 15 au ) to the sun in the upwind part of the heliosphere and further from the sun in the crosswind .",
    "we associate this with the non - monotonic heliolatitudinal distribution of the sw dynamic pressure , with 30 - 50 % increase at the middle latitudes and further decrease toward the poles ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "such behavior of the dynamic pressure changes the plasma flow beyond the ts in such a way that more plasma evacuates to the flanks which makes the pressure smaller in the upwind part and larger further from the upwind part .",
    "following the heliopause shape , the ts is also more elongated toward the solar poles . since it is quite difficult to see this effect in the large scale of figure 7(a )",
    ", we present a table of the ts and heliopause positions in the upwind direction , and in the _ voyager 1 _ and _ voyager 2 _ directions .",
    "it can be seen that in the upwind direction the ts is only slightly ( @xmath1 1 au ) further away in model 3 compared with model 2 .",
    "the effect is much larger in the directions of _ voyager 1 _ and _ 2_. the differences are 9 and 6 au , respectively .",
    "panels ( b ) , ( c ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) in figure 7 show the projections of plasma velocities and magnetic fields along the heliopause .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( e ) show the distribution inside the heliopause , panels ( c ) and ( f ) show it outside the heliopause .",
    "all of the main features are essentially the same as in model 2 . inside the heliosphere",
    ", the flow is oriented in accordance with the solar equatorial plane . although north - south asymmetry can clearly be seen in figure 7(b ) . from the interstellar side of the heliopause",
    ", the flow and the magnetic field are oriented along the y=0 axis which is the projection of the ( _ bv _ ) plane .",
    "some asymmetries are due to non - symmetric shape of the heliopause .",
    "since the shape of the heliopause has been changed in model 3 and the heliopause can be considered as an obstacle to the interstellar flow , the interstellar plasma streamlines are somewhat different in models 2 and 3 .",
    "this is seen from the comparison of figures 7(a ) and 3(b ) .",
    "the interstellar atoms are coupled with the interstellar plasma by charge exchange .",
    "therefore , the change in the plasma streamlines could influence the distribution of interstellar h atoms inside the heliosphere . despite the fact that these effects are quite important , they are not visible in a global - scale picture .",
    "qualitatively , the distributions of the interstellar h atoms in the ( _ bv _ ) plane for models 2 and 3 look very similar to model 1 .",
    "the distributions can be found in izmodenov & baranov ( 2006 , figure 4.7(b ) ) or izmodenov et al .",
    "( 2009 , figure 5(e ) ) . to explore the difference in h atom distribution quantitatively",
    ", we present ( figure 8) the zero , first , and second moments of the velocity distribution function of h atoms at 90 au as functions of the angle @xmath75 that is counted in the zx plane from the positive direction of z ( i.e. , from the upwind direction ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to note here that it is convenient to separate the interstellar atoms by primary and secondary populations .",
    "the primary population is the original interstellar atoms that penetrate into the heliosphere without charge exchange with protons .",
    "the secondary population is the atoms created in the disturbed lism around the heliopause .",
    "historically , in the case of the supersonic lism , the atom is defined as a secondary atom if it is created by charge exchange in the region between the bs and the heliopause .",
    "such a definition does not work for models with no bs , such as the models considered in this paper . in this case",
    ", we identify a newly originated h atom as the secondary atom if the interstellar plasma is sufficiently disturbed at the place of the atom s origin .",
    "more precisely , under sufficiently disturbed conditions , we assume that the temperature of the plasma is more than   @xmath110000 k.    although the total ( primary + secondary ) number density of the interstellar atoms remains the same for all of the considered models , the proportions of the primary and secondary populations are slightly different ( figure 8(a ) and 8(g ) ) .",
    "the changes in the interstellar plasma flow around the heliopause ( due to different shape of the heliopause ) lead to small ( less than 1 km s@xmath15 ) changes in the velocities of the primary and secondary components ( figure 8(b ) and 8(h ) ) .",
    "the kinetic temperature components ( which are defined as the second moments of the velocity distribution ) for the secondary h atoms are changed within 1000 - 2000 k. this is a very noticeable effect .",
    "another effect is in the deflection of the direction of the interstellar h - atom flow inside the heliosphere from the direction of the interstellar gas flow .",
    "the deflection can be measured by the deflection angle @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the z component of the h atom velocity and @xmath105 is the velocity .",
    "the deflection is associated with the change of the interstellar plasma streamlines around the heliopause due to the ismf ( izmodenov et al .",
    "2005b ) . figures 7(c ) and 7(i ) show that the deflection angle between the models could be different by of the order of 1@xmath60 , which is small but might be important for the analyses of backscattered lyman - alpha ( see , e.g. , katushkina et al .",

    "although we did not aim in this paper to discuss the relevance of the model to all available observational diagnostics of the sw / lism interaction region , we would like to note that the presented model has only four free parameters - interstellar proton and hydrogen number densities , magnitude of the ismf , and the direction of the magnetic field in the ( _ bv _ ) plane .",

    "while this list of observational diagnostics is not complete ( for example , energetic particle data should be added as well ) , it is quite evident that in the context of the current model paradigm it is impossible to find the model parameters to reconcile all of the available diagnostics .",

    "<S> this is a three - dimensional ( 3d ) kinetic - magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) model that takes into account sw and interstellar plasmas ( including @xmath0 particles in sw and helium ions in lism ) , the solar and interstellar magnetic fields , and the interstellar hydrogen atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the latitudinal dependence of sw and the actual flow direction of the interstellar gas with respect to the sun are also taken into account in the model . </S>",
    "<S> it was very essential that our numerical code had been developed in such a way that any numerical diffusion or reconnection across the heliopause had not been allowed in the model . </S>",
    "<S> the heliospheric current sheet is a rotational discontinuity in the ideal mhd and can be treated kinematically . in the paper , we focus in particular on the effects of the heliospheric magnetic field and on the heliolatitudinal dependence of sw . </S>"
