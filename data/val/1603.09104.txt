    "the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation is a model equation describing the evolution of long - crested waves at the surface of a body of fluid .",
    "the equation is derived as a physical model equation under the assumption that there is an approximate balance between nonlinear steepening effects and dispersive spreading . in mathematical terms , this balance is expressed by introducing two small parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 measuring the wave amplitude and the wave length , respectively .",
    "the main assumptions on the waves to be represented by solutions of the kdv equation are that they be of small amplitude and long wavelength when compared to the undisturbed depth of the fluid .",
    "suppose that the undisturbed depth of the fluid is given by @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath3 represents a typical wave amplitude , and @xmath4 represents a typical wavelength , the two parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 should be small and of the same order .",
    "this is the boussinesq scaling .",
    "if in addition the wave motion is predominantly in a single direction , then the kdv equation is an approximate model describing the surface wave motion @xcite .",
    "if the undisturbed depth @xmath2 is taken as a unit of distance and @xmath7 is taken as a unit of time , then the kdv equation appears in the form @xmath8    in the present article , the focus is on whether  or rather how  the kdv equation is able to describe incipient wave breaking .",
    "while the kdv equation does not admit the distinctive steepening and development of infinite gradients known from nonlinear hyperbolic equations , it will be shown here that the kdv equation features a different kind of wave breaking which is more closely related to spilling at the wave crest .",
    "let us recall that the kdv equation can be thought of as a combination of the simple nonlinear balance law @xmath9 and the linear dispersive equation @xmath10 while all waves featuring negative slope break at some point in the model , no waves break in the model ( however , features dispersive blow - up for some data @xcite ) .",
    "the kdv equation allows a balance of nonlinear steepening effects and dispersive spreading which arrests the typical hyperbolic wave breaking exhibited by , and leads to the formation of steady traveling waves , such as solitary and cnoidal waves @xcite which propagate without a change in the wave profile .",
    "specifically , solitary - wave solutions of are of the form @xmath11 where the phase velocity is given by @xmath12 while these formulas define solutions of the kdv equation for all waveheights @xmath13 , it turns out that solutions of large waveheight are inconsistent with the model in which the kdv equation is valid . in particular , as will be shown in section 2 , for waveheights exceeding the critical waveheight @xmath14 , the phase velocity of the wave is smaller than the particle velocity at the crest , a fact which may be interpreted as incipient wave breaking .     which features hyperbolic wave breaking .",
    "right panel : solution of the airy equation @xmath15 which features dispersive spreading .",
    "initial data are shown as dashed curves .",
    "if the dashed curve were used as initial data for the kdv equation , then this wave would propagate without change in shape.,title=\"fig : \" ]    which features hyperbolic wave breaking .",
    "right panel : solution of the airy equation @xmath15 which features dispersive spreading .",
    "initial data are shown as dashed curves .",
    "if the dashed curve were used as initial data for the kdv equation , then this wave would propagate without change in shape.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to elaborate on this argument , note that it is shown in @xcite , that the derivation of the equation as a surface water - wave model enables the reconstruction of an approximation of the fluid velocity field underneath the surface .",
    "in particular , it is possible to derive relations expressing the horizontal and vertical velocity components in terms of the principal unknown variable @xmath16 which describes the shape of the free surface .",
    "the horizontal velocity component in the fluid is given by @xmath17 and this relation holds to the same order in the asymptotic parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 as to which the kdv equation is valid .",
    "since the horizontal component of the particle velocity can be found approximately , it may be compared to the local phase velocity of the wave .",
    "this leads to one of the most fundamental breaking criteria used in the literature , the convective breaking criterion which predicts wave breaking if the particle velocity at the wavecrest exceeds the phase velocity of the wave ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "more specifically , this breaking criterion ( often termed kinematic criterion ) is based on the local froude number , and predicts breaking if @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the horizontal component of the velocity field evaluated at the free surface , @xmath20 is the local phase velocity of the wave . to illustrate this point of view , figure 2 shows two waves with corresponding fluid particles near the crest of the wave . in the left panel ,",
    "a wave with sufficiently small amplitude is depicted . a fluid particle located near the wavecrest remains in the free surface and recedes from the crest in unison with the wave motion .",
    "however in the right panel , a wave of higher amplitude is shown , and particles located near the crest have higher horizontal velocity than the wave itself .    the utility of the convective criterion has been the subject of some discussions in the literature . for wave breaking in shallow water , such as in focus in the present article ,",
    "some studies such as @xcite conclude that the convective criterion does a fair job of predicting wave breaking even for three - dimensional waves . on the other hand ,",
    "studies focusing on breaking of deep - water waves such as @xcite observe that the kinematic criterion has been useful in some practical situations , while there is also evidence that it may not be a reliable indicator to pinpoint the onset of breaking in the case of deep water . in some of the cases where the convective breaking criterion performs badly , the difficulty of obtaining accurate readings for the phase velocity of the wave in experimental situations may be responsible @xcite .",
    "note that the criterion is stated in sufficient generality to be applicable to both experimental and numerical work . in the case of numerical modeling , and in particular in the case of phase - resolving models , there is no difficulty in evaluating the local wave and particle velocities .",
    "the local phase velocity can usually be be approximated using a variety of methods .",
    "for example , fourier techniques have been used in @xcite .",
    "what is more , in the case of solitary and cnoidal waves , the phase and particle velocities are known in closed form , and it is straightforward to test the breaking criterion .",
    "these computations will be carried out in sections 2 and 3 .    while it is relatively easy to evaluate the breaking criterion in several situations for the equation",
    ", it should also be noted that free surface waves in shallow water are not likely to feature breaking unless some focusing effect is present , such as an underlying current @xcite or strong three - dimensional effects @xcite . on",
    "the other hand wave breaking is likely to occur in the presence of forcing in the form of an uneven bottom topography or a discharge .",
    "these two possibilities are sketched in figure [ naturalbreaking ] .",
    "in particular the left panel of figure [ naturalbreaking ] indicates one of the most widely known type of wave breaking , the development of breakers on a sloping beach . in this case , depending on a number of parameters such as waveheight , wavelength and bottom slope , a variety of breaking phenomena takes place , ranging from spilling at the crest , to overturning and surging breaking @xcite .    in the right panel of figure [ naturalbreaking ] , the case of a forced inflow is indicated . in this case , a so - called bore generally emerges .",
    "sufficiently small discharges lead to the appearance of an undular bore which is a characterized by a moderately steep front followed by a leading wave and trailing smaller waves . for larger inflows , the leading wave behind the bore may break , and",
    "for large enough inflows , the bore can be entirely turbulent @xcite . in the final section of the present paper , the case of a forced inflow and undular bore is discussed in some detail , and the question of the transition from purely undular to undular with spilling breaking is investigated .        before we enter the main development of this paper , some remarks are in order .",
    "first , it should be noted that convective wave breaking of the type discussed here is unlikely to happen in hyperbolic equations or systems .",
    "while the simple conservation law @xmath21 does not contain expressions for the local particle velocity , the nonlinear shallow - water equations @xmath22 include both the surface deflection @xmath23 , and an average horizontal particle velocity @xmath24 in the description . in this case ,",
    "a simple wave propagating to the right is given by the riemann invariant @xmath25 , and has phase velocity @xmath26 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , for a wave profile @xmath27 with undisturbed depth @xmath28 , the fluid velocity is @xmath29 , and the phase velocity of the wave is @xmath30 .",
    "thus we see that convective breaking does not happen in this case . on the other hand",
    ", the typical hyperbolic steepening and eventual breaking will happen for appropriate initial conditions .",
    "secondly , it should be mentioned that the relation and similar expressions for the vertical velocity may also be used advantageously for a number of purposes , such as the definition of a family of boussinesq models @xcite , describing particle paths beneath the surface @xcite , and and the study of mechanical balance laws associated to the evolution equation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there is a variety of different strategies to construct the velocity field in the fluid , such as the analytic method used in @xcite to find the velocities associated to a periodic cnoidal solution of the kdv equation .",
    "particle paths under periodic traveling waves can also be found to rather high accuracy using the lagrangian approach @xcite . concerning the notion of mechanical balance laws , we mention in particular that an analysis along these lines casts doubt on the conservation of mechanical energy in the kdv approximation @xcite .",
    "the conservation of energy in both the kdv and higher - order kdv equations has also been questioned recently in a study which utilizes a lagrangian framework @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the convective breaking criterion is applied to the solitary wave , and it is found that the limiting waveheight is @xmath14 . in section 3 ,",
    "the breaking criterion is applied to the cnoidal wave solutions .",
    "it is found that cnoidal wave solutions may feature breaking at a much smaller waveheight than the solitary wave .",
    "finally , section 4 is devoted to the study of wave breaking in a dynamic situation with a forced inflow .",
    "the resulting undular bore features a leading wave which may break , and the focus is on finding the critical case dividing the field of purely undular bores from partially turbulent breaking bores .",
    "the surface water - wave problem for an inviscid fluid is generally described by the euler equations with an impenetrable bottom , and kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions at the free surface .",
    "assuming weak transverse effects , the unknowns are the surface elevation @xmath31 , the horizontal and vertical fluid velocities @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , and the pressure @xmath34 . if the assumption of irrotational flow is made , then a velocity potential @xmath35 can be used . in the non - dimensional variables mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the problem may be posed on the domain @xmath36 .",
    "the derivation of the kdv equation is based on approximating the velocity potential by an asymptotic series . in suitably scaled variables ,",
    "the horizontal velocity component takes the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents the horizontal velocity at the bottom . on the other hand",
    ", the one - way assumption inherent in the kdv equation necessitates that the velocity at the bed is given by @xmath39 by combining these two relations and neglecting terms of @xmath40 , we obtain an expression for the horizontal component of the velocity field in terms of @xmath16 and @xmath41 : @xmath42 in the original variables , the horizontal velocity is then expressed as @xmath43 + and the breaking criterion can be written as @xmath44    we now apply this breaking criterion to the solitary wave given by , where @xmath13 is the waveheight , @xmath45 is the wavespeed , and @xmath46 is the initial location of the wave crest . differentiating twice with respect to @xmath47 yields @xmath48 since the solitary wave retains its shape for all time we may evaluate at @xmath49 , in which case we obtain @xmath50 and @xmath51 . substituting these values into equation and evaluating at the surface yields the breaking criterion @xmath52 setting the left hand side equal to the right hand side and rearranging terms yields @xmath53 for the critical value of the waveheight .",
    "we see that @xmath54 is a fourth order polynomial in @xmath13 , and since @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 while @xmath58 , it can have only one positive root which lies in @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "this root can be found numerically to obtain the following value of the maximum allowable waveheight for the solitary wave : @xmath60 even though the kdv equation admits solutions with any waveheight , waves with a waveheight larger than @xmath61 do not describe actual surface waves since these waves already feature incipient wave breaking .",
    "of course the waveshape of a solitary - wave solution of the kdv equation may not be close to a surface water wave already for smaller waveheights than @xmath61 ( cf .",
    "the cnoidal waves are defined with the help of the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind . for a given elliptic parameter @xmath62 ,",
    "this integral is @xmath63 the elliptic functions @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are defined as @xmath67 on the other hand , the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind , respectively , are defined by @xmath68 + as shown in @xcite , the cnoidal travelling wave solutions of are given in terms of three parameters @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the wave height , @xmath74 is the wavespeed , and @xmath75 is the elliptic parameter . any cnoidal wave is completely determined as long as these three constants are fixed .",
    "if @xmath76 is defined by @xmath77 , then the wavelength can be written as @xmath78 .",
    "since the wave oscillates about the equilibrium level of the surface , the mean value of the surface displacement over one wavelength should be zero .",
    "this requirement can be expressed by integrating over one wavelength , viz . @xmath79 and it can be shown that this integral is @xmath80 since @xmath73 , we therefore have @xmath81 .",
    "the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 , can then also be expressed in terms of wave height @xmath13 and the elliptic parameter @xmath82 as follows : @xmath83 thus , fixing @xmath13 and @xmath82 is sufficient to specify any cnoidal wave , as long as the undisturbed water level is set to zero .    to determine whether a given cnoidal wave is a reasonable description of a water wave in the kdv approximation , we test the wave breaking criterion . by differentiating twice with respect",
    "to @xmath47 we obtain @xmath84 where the argument is given by @xmath85 .",
    "evaluating at @xmath86 yields @xmath87 substituting these expressions into equation transforms the breaking criterion into @xmath88 defining the constants @xmath89 we can write the constants @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 as @xmath90 substituting these definitions into equation and setting the left and right hand side equal yields @xmath91    .critical waveheight for the cnoidal solution of the kdv - equation , calculated for various values of the elliptic parameter @xmath82 .",

    "different values of @xmath82 and corresponding values of @xmath93 are listed in table [ cnoidaltable ] .",

    "figure [ fig : hcritvsm ] shows a plot of @xmath93 obtained using a finer resolution in @xmath82 than displayed in the table above .",
    "it can be seen that the maximum wave height seems to approach zero as @xmath82 approaches zero , which fact is related to a going outside of the domain of validity of the boussinesq approximation , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are assumed to be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "it is also worth noting that the limiting values of @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath45 as @xmath94 are : @xmath100 applying this to equation gives the breaking criterion for the solitary wave , equation .",
    "this is also easy to see if we plot the maximum wave height of the cnoidal wave as a function of wavelength @xmath96 .",
    "a bore or traveling hydraulic jump is the transition between two uniform flows with different depths . assuming that one of these flow depths is the undisturbed water level @xmath2 , and the incident water level is given by @xmath101 , we denote by @xmath102 the strength of the bore . with",
    "the nondimensionalization explained in the introduction , the undisturbed depth is @xmath28 , and the incident water level is @xmath0 . in this section",
    "we aim to find the threshold for which the bore transitions from being purely undular to one which exhibits breaking in the leading wave .",
    "this threshold is defined in terms of the ratio @xmath0 , and was found experimentally to be @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , if the kinematic breaking criterion is used in connection with phase - resolving numerical models , there is no difficulty in evaluating the local wave and particle velocities . when coupled with the boussinesq ansatz for the horizontal velocity , the convective criterion allowed for a somewhat accurate description of the breaking of the leading wave behind an undular bore @xcite . in this study ,",
    "numerical integration of a boussinesq system for undular bores indicated that breaking should occur if the bore strength is greater than @xmath104 .",
    "while this result is qualitatively in the right direction , the critical bore strength is overestimated by about @xmath105 . in the following",
    ", it will be shown how this result can be improved .    in order to find the critical bore strength in the numerical kdv model",
    ", we will therefore use the value of @xmath106 as a starting point , and then proceed with small increments until the breaking criterion is reached , i.e. when the horizontal particle speed of the fluid exceeds the phase speed .",

    "the right - shifted initial surface profile data are indicated ( dotted lines ) in the top panel . left : here @xmath110 is great than @xmath111 at the surface ; no breaking .",

    "the right - shifted initial surface profile data are indicated ( dotted lines ) in the top panel . left : here @xmath110 is great than @xmath111 at the surface ; no breaking .",
    "right : here @xmath112 is smaller than @xmath111 at the surface : breaking.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to test the convective breaking criterion , at each time step the horizontal particle velocity and the phase speed of the bore front have to be calculated numerically .",
    "first , given the numerical solution @xmath113 , we approximate the second spatial derivative of the surface , by the second - order central - difference formula @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the spatial grid size .",
    "we then define the approximate horizontal particle velocity at a grid point @xmath116 and time @xmath117 , and evaluated at the free surface as @xmath118 , such that equation yields @xmath119    the phase speed of the first wave behind the bore front can be approximated by measuring how the maximum of this wave propagates in time .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : boreprofiles ] shows the initial profile with @xmath120 and @xmath121 as a dashed curve , and the resulting bore profile at @xmath109 as a solid curve .",
    "the figure also shows the horizontal component of the velocity field underneath the first wavecrest , and it is apparent that this bore does not break as the particle velocity remains smaller than the propagation velocity of the leading wave .    after increasing @xmath0 by increments of @xmath122 breaking",
    "is obtained for @xmath123 .",
    "a computation for @xmath124 ( which is already past breaking ) is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : boreprofiles ] .",
    "it can be seen that the horizontal particle velocity is greater than the front velocity after the solution has developed for some time . as expected , the critical bore strength is bigger than the one found experimentally , but is fairly close to the one found in @xcite .",
    "the maximum waveheight @xmath125 of the solution may be extracted at the particular time step where breaking first occurs .",
    "if this waveheight is compared to the critical waveheight of the solitary wave from section [ sec : breakingcrit ] , it is found that the leading wave behind the bore breaks at a waveheight slightly larger than the solitary wave .",
    "however , the values obtained for maximum wave height of the bore seem to approach the maximum height of the solitary wave as the bore strength decreases .",
    "since smaller bore strengths will have larger lead times before the largest wave reaches the point of breaking , in these cases , the leading wave has already separated as an individual solitary wave , and the waveheight at breaking matches closely the value obtained for @xmath61 .",
    "the figure below shows a plot of the calculated values of @xmath126 as a function of time .",
    "a curve of the form @xmath127 has also been fitted to the data .",
    "the parameters @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath20 in the fitted curve are given by @xmath130 and the residual sum of squares is @xmath131 .",
    "the curve fits the data fairly well , and it is evident from the form of the equation that it approaches the value @xmath132 for large @xmath133 .",
    "this value is very close to the maximum possible height of the solitary wave @xmath134 .",
    "we can therefore confirm that the bore eventually disintegrates into several solitary waves , but as the bore strength , @xmath0 , increases , the bore will break before this happens and thus can not be described in terms of solitary waves .",
    "this observation also points to the possibility of obtaining a lower value of the critical bore strength @xmath135 if a similar curve fit is used . to this end",
    ", we plot the bore strength as a function of corresponding breaking times .",
    "if a curve of the same form as above is used , the parameters @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath20 in the fitted curve are given by @xmath136 the residual is @xmath137 , and visual inspection of figure [ borestrength ] indicates that the fitted curve fits the data rather well also in this case .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath20 indicates an asymptotic critical bore strength of @xmath138 for large values of @xmath133 , and this value is somewhat lower than the value of @xmath135 obtained previously .",
    "it has been shown that the derivation of the kdv equation as a model for surface water waves admits the definition of a local particle velocity field .",
    "the horizontal component of this velocity field may be evaluated near the crest of a wave . for solitary and cnoidal waves , evaluating",
    "the local froude number leads to a convective wave breaking criterion which shows that there is a limiting waveheight beyond which the waves feature incipient wave breaking .",
    "thus even though the solitary wave and the cnoidal waves are solutions of the kdv equation for any waveheight , they do not represent valid approximate surface waves for waveheights beyond the critical waveheight .",
    "the critical waveheight for solitary waves is @xmath14 is quite large , and it is not surprising that these waves do not represent reasonable approximations to real surface waves . for the cnoidal waves , the situation is more complex . for waves near stokes number @xmath28 ,",
    "the limiting waveheight according to the convective breaking criterion is in the range @xmath139 to @xmath140 ( see table 1 ) , and these waves are in the range where it is generally thought that solutions of the kdv equation give a faithful approximation of real surface waves .",
    "as the elliptic parameter @xmath82 approaches @xmath28 , the critical waveheight of the cnoidal waves approaches @xmath14 . on the other hand , the limit in the case when @xmath141 is the linear case in which solutions have negligible amplitude , and the critical waveheight in this case is indeed @xmath142 .",
    "the convective breaking criterion has also been used to determine the critical bore strength @xmath135 for which an undular bore first exhibits breaking .",
    "the result @xmath143 is still somewhat higher than the experimentally determined value @xmath103 , which was obtained using wave tank experiments @xcite , but lower than the ratio obtained using a similar numerical model in @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy with the experimental findings could be ascribed to the assumptions made on the physical system , i.e. the absence of transverse motion of the fluid and an irrotational and inviscid flow . while recent studies have highlighted the importance of these effects @xcite , it is not clear that the inclusion of any of these will improve the quantitative agreement between the current analysis and the experimental findings of @xcite .",
    "for example frictional damping due to molecular viscosity and boundary effects are more likely to delay the onset of breaking than to facilitate it .",
    "it therefore seems likely that the limiting procedure used in obtaining the model equations is responsible for some of the discrepancy , and a possible avenue for improving the quantitative description of wave breaking in an undular bore would be to include some of the higher - order terms which were neglected in the kdv model .",
    "such higher - order models including both nonlinear and dispersive effects are well known ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .    another possible improvement is the relaxation of the breaking criterion recently advocated in @xcite . in these works ,",
    "several breaking criteria were used in connection with numerical boussinesq models , and with the aim of quantifying the onset of breaking in shoaling waves .",
    "it was found that the convective criterion did not perform as well as other criteria based on local waveheight @xcite , and a relaxation constant was introduced in order to improve the analysis .",
    "however , since this constant has to be determined empirically from a given set of experiments , we have chosen not to pursue such a development here .",

    "the numerical approximation of solutions of the equation is based on a finite - difference method for the spatial derivatives with appropriate boundary conditions , and a hybrid adams - bashforth / crank - nicolson time integration scheme .",

    "<S> the kdv equation is a model equation for waves at the surface of an inviscid incompressible fluid , and it is well known that the equation describes the evolution of unidirectional waves of small amplitude and long wavelength fairly accurately if the waves fall into the boussinesq regime .    </S>",
    "<S> the kdv equation allows a balance of nonlinear steepening effects and dispersive spreading which leads to the formation of steady wave profiles in the form of solitary waves and cnoidal waves . </S>",
    "<S> while these wave profiles are solutions of the kdv equation for any amplitude , it is shown here that there for both the solitary and the cnoidal waves , there are critical amplitudes for which the horizontal component of the particle velocity matches the phase velocity of the wave . </S>",
    "<S> solitary or cnoidal solutions of the kdv equation which surpass these amplitudes feature incipient wave breaking as the particle velocity exceeds the phase velocity near the crest of the wave , and the model breaks down due to violation of the kinematic surface boundary condition .    </S>",
    "<S> the condition for breaking can be conveniently formulated as a convective breaking criterion based on the local froude number at the wave crest . </S>",
    "<S> this breaking criterion can also be applied to time - dependent situations , and one case of interest is the development of an undular bore created by an influx at a lateral boundary . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that this boundary forcing leads to wave breaking in the leading wave behind the bore if a certain threshold is surpassed . </S>"
