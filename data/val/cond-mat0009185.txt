    "optical lattices are a cornerstone of much of atom optics .",
    "they have been successfully used to form matter - wave diffraction gratings , were at the heart of the discovery of subrecoil cooling , and were manipulated to study atomic bloch oscillations @xcite , and dynamic instabilities and chaos.@xcite they are also used as an outcoupling mechanism in a mode - locked atom laser @xcite , and are central to several quantum computing schemes using neutral atoms.@xcite as atom optics rapidly moves toward applications , frequently listed possibilities include gravimeters and gravity gradiometers .",
    "gravity is also an important and natural way to accelerate atoms , so as to coherently reduce their de broglie wavelength for nanofabrication applications .",
    "hence , there is considerable interest in studying the combined effects of an optical lattice and gravitation on the dynamics of ultracold atoms .",
    "the study of particles in periodic potentials has of course been a major tenet of condensed matter physics , and it will therefore come as no great surprise that our analysis relies heavily on the use of its tools . in particular ,",
    "delocalized bloch states and band structure analyses are known to be ideal for the study of electrons in crystals . for deep potentials , though , the use of localized wannier states is often preferable and indeed , has proven useful e.g. in the study of the dipole - dipole interaction in optical lattices.@xcite when a linear potential is superimposed to the underlying periodic structure , the situation is less clear : the localized wannier states become delocalized , and there is some debate as to which representation is then most useful .",
    "one possibility is to use a so - called wannier - bloch states representation , with an emphasis on the delocalized character of the atomic wave functions .",
    "alternatively , the wannier - stark approach emphasizes the localized aspect of the wave functions .",
    "a third alternative consists in treating the periodic potential as a perturbation on top of the gravitational field .",
    "clearly , each approach has its pros and cons , depending upon the depth of the lattice compared to the gravitational potential . for deep lattices ,",
    "though , the wannier - stark analysis seems preferable . in this approach ,",
    "the states of the atoms form a sequence of resonances separated by equal energy intervals referred to as wannier - stark ladders.@xcite such ladders were recently observed in accelerated optical lattices .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we calculate the wannier - stark ladders induced by gravity on atoms in optical lattices , using a theoretical approach recently developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and based on a floquet representation of the wannier states .",
    "this technique , which leads to a well - defined eigenvalue problem for the determination of the wannier - stark ladder , was developed for the more general situation of time - periodic potentials , but is also perfectly adapted to time - independent potentials .",
    "section ii introduces our physical model , and briefly reviews the definitions of the bloch and wannier states , which are the eigenstates of the system in the absence of a gravitational field .",
    "section iii outlines the floquet approach to the determination of the wannier - stark ladder , discussing the onset of a ladder of complex `` resonances '' associated with metastable localized states of the atoms .",
    "selected numerical results are presented in section iv . finally section v is a summary and outlook .",
    "we consider the situation of ultracold atoms of mass @xmath0 trapped in the optical potential resulting from two far - off resonant and counterpropagating optical fields of frequency @xmath1 and wave number @xmath2 .",
    "the atoms are assumed to be two - level atoms , and we neglect all complications resulting from the possible existence of multiple ground states and the associated optical pumping .",
    "after adiabatic elimination of their upper electronic states , the atoms are therefore described as scalar particles subject to the periodic potential @xmath3 where @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the rabi frequency of the atomic transition of frequency @xmath6 under consideration . in the presence of gravity ,",
    "the atomic hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the force of gravity and @xmath9 we consider a one - dimensional situation where the lasers generating the optical lattice are along the @xmath10-axis , so that @xmath11 = i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "the band structure associated with the hamiltonian @xmath12 is of course well - known .",
    "it is displayed in fig . 1 for reference .",
    "it shows the energy - wave number dispersion relation @xmath13 in the first brillouin zone @xcite , @xmath14 being the band index .",
    "the associated energy eigenstates of @xmath12 are the familiar bloch states @xmath15 they are conveniently expressed as @xmath16 where the functions @xmath17 are periodic in @xmath10 .",
    "they satisfy the eigenvalue equation @xmath18 the hamiltonian @xmath19 being given by @xmath20    from eq .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) , the evolution of the bloch wave functions @xmath17 is simply @xmath21 \\chi_{n , k}(z,0).\\ ] ] it is furthermore possible to take advantage of the periodicity of the optical potential to expand @xmath17 on a lattice basis @xmath22 , @xmath23 integer , as the fourier series @xmath24 where we have used the coordinate representation of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and we recognize the primitive reciprocal vector @xmath27 in the exponent .    in prevision of our subsequent discussion ,",
    "we introduce at this point the characteristic time @xmath28 which will later on be identified as the `` bloch period , '' as well as the associated `` bloch phase '' @xmath29 since the energies @xmath13 always appear in the form of a phase factor in the evolution of the system , it is in many cases convenient to plot them in a reduced phase interval .",
    "this representation will be useful in identifying the resonances appearing in the presence of a gravitational potential .",
    "we conclude this section by recalling that the bloch states are completely delocalized , with the atomic wave functions extending over the whole lattice . for deep lattices ,",
    "it is oftentimes more convenient to use instead localized wannier states .",
    "they are constructed as linear superpositions of the bloch states @xmath30 as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the position of the @xmath33-th lattice site , @xmath34 @xmath33 is an integer , and we recognize that @xmath35 is just the primitive lattice period @xmath36 of the optical potential .",
    "as is well known , the wannier function @xmath37 describes an atomic wave packet localized at the @xmath33-th site of the optical lattice .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of the impact of gravity on the atomic dynamics in the lattice .",
    "we proceed by eliminating the gravitational contribution from the hamiltonian ( [ a2 ] ) via the unitary transformation @xmath38\\tilde{\\psi}(z , t ) .",
    "\\label{b1}\\ ] ] the evolution of @xmath39 is governed by the _ time - dependent _ transformed hamiltonian @xmath40 which is nothing but the hamiltonian @xmath12 with momenta shifted by @xmath41 . from this observation , it follows that its time evolution is governed by the equation @xmath42 eq .",
    "( [ b3 ] ) provides an immediate understanding of bloch oscillations : after a time @xmath43 , the momentum shift appearing in the hamiltonian ( [ b3 ] ) is precisely equal to @xmath44 , the primitive reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "an atom starting at the edge of the first brillouin zone is therefore uniformly accelerated into the next brillouin zone , or equivalently undergoes an umklapp process in the first zone . in optics terms , this means that the bragg scattering condition is fulfilled , with scattering of the atom from the state of momentum @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "this justifies identifying @xmath47 as the bloch period as we have done in section ii .    with this intuition at hand",
    ", we introduce the wannier - bloch states @xmath48 as those states which are stroboscopic eigenstates of the time - dependent hamiltonian ( [ b3 ] ) at successive intervals of @xmath47 , that is , that satisfy the eigenvalue equation @xmath49\\psi_{n , k}(z ) .",
    "\\label{b5}\\ ] ] with @xmath50    despite the fact that we use the same notation @xmath13 for simplicity , it is important to realize that the quantities appearing in eq .",
    "( [ b5 ] ) are _ not _ the same as the band energies of section ii .",
    "indeed , due to the fact that the hamiltonian in the presence of gravity is time - dependent , the @xmath13 are only quasi - energies , or `` resonances . ''",
    "we will see shortly that they are complex , their imaginary part leading to a finite lifetime , and form a series of ladders of equidistant levels .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath48 present the considerable advantage that the only momentum involved at the end of their stroboscopic evolution is the primitive reciprocal lattice vector @xmath44 .",
    "that is , @xmath51 commutes with the momentum shift operator @xmath52 $ ] , and hence it is still possible to use a bloch - like quasi - momentum representation to stroboscopically diagonalize the problem . rewriting then , in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ a99 ] ) , the wannier - bloch functions as @xmath53 where @xmath54 , leads to the bloch - like eigenvalue equation @xcite @xmath55\\chi_{n , k}(z ) , \\label{b7}\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , \\label{b8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 stands for time - ordered .    from the analysis",
    "so far , it would appear that we need to solve the eigenvalue problem ( [ b7 ] ) for a large number of initial times between 0 and @xmath47 to obtain the full system evolution .",
    "this , however , is not the case , as the quasi - energy spectrum @xmath13 is completely degenerate for the time - independent potential considered here , @xmath60 .",
    "this can be seen by considering the evolution of a wannier - bloch state for a fraction @xmath61 of the bloch period , where @xmath62 is an integer . in that interval",
    "the operator @xmath63 with @xmath64 transforms the wannier - bloch state @xmath48 into another wannier - bloch state of quasi - momentum @xmath65 , @xmath66 combining eqs .",
    "( [ b54 ] ) and ( [ b55 ] ) yields readily @xmath67 \\psi_{n , k}(z)\\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\exp\\left [ -\\frac{i}{\\hbar } e_n(k)t_b \\right ] \\psi_{n , k'}(z)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used eq .",
    "( [ b54 ] ) to commute @xmath68 and @xmath69 this completes the proof that for the time - independent potential @xmath70 at hand , the quasi - energy spectrum is degenerate .    as a result",
    ", the continuous time evolution of the wannier - bloch states is simply given by @xmath71    the calculation of the quasi - energies @xmath72 follows the procedure discussed in ref .",
    "it consists in finding the metastable wannier - bloch states by solving the eigenvalue problem ( [ b7 ] ) assuming a truncation of the momentum space .",
    "the representation of the operator @xmath73 in this truncated basis is nonunitary , and for this reason the `` energies '' @xmath72 are complex , @xmath74 their real part give the positions of the `` resonances '' , while their imaginary part give their widths , or lifetimes .",
    "this is to be contrasted to the gravitation - free situation , where the eigenvalue problem is tridiagonal in momentum space , and the eigenvalues are then real .",
    "( [ b8 ] ) shows clearly how the acceleration of gravity removes the discrete , tridiagonal nature of the problem and makes it continuous in momentum space .",
    "we have previously discussed how the bloch functions approach puts the emphasis on delocalized states .",
    "clearly , this same characteristic also holds for the wannier - bloch states discussed so far . as in the gravitation - free situation ,",
    "it is sometimes useful to consider states of a localized nature instead . in complete analogy with the wannier functions",
    ", we therefore introduce the wannier - stark states as @xmath75 where as we recall @xmath76 is the position of the @xmath33-th lattice site .",
    "taking into account the temporal evolution ( [ b99 ] ) of the wannier - bloch states gives the continuous time evolution of the wannier - stark wave functions @xmath77 , @xmath78\\psi_{n , m}(z ) .",
    "\\label{b12}\\ ] ] this shows that the wannier - stark states constitute a ladder of quasi - stationary functions characterized by sets of discrete levels of energies @xmath79 of equal spacings @xmath80 .",
    "these energy levels are illustrated in fig .",
    "in this section , we present selected results from the numerical study of gravitationally - induced wannier - stark resonances for the case of shallow optical lattices .",
    "the calculations proceed by solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the operator ( [ b77 ] ) , truncated in momentum space as previously discussed .",

    "( [ c3 ] ) gives the elements of a symmetric matrix whose truncation causes no problem .",
    "we proceed by first truncating it , and by an iterative process of successive time - ordered intervals we then evaluate the evolution operator @xmath84 using eq .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) .",
    "the matrix elements of the operator @xmath94 are given by @xmath95 whose truncation generates a nonunitary operator .",
    "taking the dimension of the matrices to be @xmath96 , we have found that for sufficiently large @xmath97 , typically , 20 to 40 , the position of the resonances becomes independent of the dimension of the truncated momentum space .",
    "the simulations were carried out for the case of @xmath98 atoms @xcite trapped in an optical lattice generated by a far - off resonance optical standing wave of wavelength @xmath99 .",
    "the depth of the lattice was taken to be @xmath100 , where @xmath101 khz is the recoil energy .",

    "( recall that only degenerate solutions are associated with resonances . ) the real part of these quasienergies are @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively , corresponding to the bloch phases @xmath109 ( solid line ) and @xmath110 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the widths of the resonances , given by the imaginary part of the degenerate eigenvalues of eq .",
    "( [ b13 ] ) , are shown in fig .",
    "4 . for the relatively shallow lattice considered here ,",
    "the highest resonance is probably too wide , with @xmath111 ( dotted line ) , to be of practical use .",
    "in contrast , the width of the most stable resonance , @xmath112 ( solid line ) , is three orders of magnitude narrower than the wannier - stark ladder separation @xmath113 . as further discussed in the following section",
    ", such narrow lines might be of considerable interest in the development of atom optical gravity gradiometers .    despite the long lifetime of the metastable wannier - stark states , the fact that they are finite indicates that atoms initially localized in a lattice site eventually tunnel to neighboring wells .",
    "this is shown in fig . 5 , which plots on a logarithmic scale the absolute squared expansion coefficients @xmath114 of the bloch states , see eq .",
    "( [ a6 ] ) , for the lowest band @xmath115 .",
    "the solid line correspond to the gravity - free situation , while the dotted line correspond to gravity .",
    "when the gravity force is applied the metastable states tunnel through the optical potential hills in the downward direction ( negative @xmath10-axis ) , so the contribution of negative @xmath116 vectors increases .",
    "indeed , there is a general shift of all the coefficients @xmath117 due to the action of the gravity field .    we have also evaluated the position and width of the resonances as a function of the well depth @xmath118 of the optical lattice .",
    "6 and 7 show the position and width of the lowest resonance , @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively , in units of @xmath121 .",
    "as we can see in these plots , the position @xmath119 goes up as the well depth decreases , while , the width @xmath120 decreases very rapidly for highest potential depths .",
    "finally , figure 8 is a plot of the energy gap @xmath122 between the lowest resonance and continuum states .",
    "for a number of potential applications of atom optics , such as e.g. nanolithography and atom holography , it is desirable to accelerate the atoms so as to produce coherent beams of shorter de broglie wavelength . this can be achieved either via gravity , or in lattices with ramped detuning between the two counterpropagating fields , as already mentioned . since eventually",
    ", the atoms will then escape the trap , matter - wave acceleration is also of much relevance in the study of output couplers for atom lasers , as was realized for instance the mode - locked laser of ref .",
    "in addition , atom optics with accelerated beams offers novel approaches to interferometry .",
    "for instance , using optical fields to hold atoms against gravity may lead to the realization of accelerometers of unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "these new developments require a detailed understanding of the combined effects of light and gravity on the motion of ultracold atoms . using a recently developed floquet - type analysis @xcite that removes many of the question marks previously attached to the computation of the wannier - stark ladder",
    ", we have shown that a detailed quantitative calculation of the position and width of these levels can now easily be obtained numerically .",
    "we illustrated how deep optical lattices lead to the existence of families of long - lived , equidistant quasi - energy levels that should be of much interest in gravitation gradiometers and accelerometers .",
    "as the wells become shallower , however , the number of quasi - bound levels decreases , and their lifetime shortens .",
    "we note that the applications we have in mind are likely to eventually require the use of atomic samples , most likely bose - einstein condensates , for which atom - atom interactions and the associated nonlinear phase shifts can no longer be ignored .",
    "this is likely to influence the wannier - stark spectra in interesting ways , that we plan on studying in the future .",
