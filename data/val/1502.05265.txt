    "the standard textbook description of the electrical double layers is based on the mean - field poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory . at large surface - charge density , high counter - ion valency and high ion concentration  the so - called strong coupling limit ",
    "it is well recognized that pb theory fails to capture a number of qualitative effects , such as like - charge attraction@xcite and charge inversion@xcite .",
    "liquid - state theories@xcite and other strong - coupling theories@xcite have been employed to account for the strong ion - ion correlations in this regime .    in the opposite limit  the weak - coupling regime ",
    "it is generally accepted that the electric double layer is well described by the pb theory@xcite . performing a loop - wise perturbation expansion@xcite in the coupling parameter ( to be defined below ) , netz@xcite demonstrated that the pb theory is the leading - order theory in the weak - coupling limit , and becomes exact in the limit of zero coupling strength . applying netz",
    "s approach explicitly to surfaces with dielectric discontinuity , kandu@xmath0 and podgornik@xcite concluded that , under the weak - coupling condition , the image force only enters as a small correction to the leading pb theory , which vanishes in the limit of zero coupling . in particular , the self - energy due to image charge interaction was shown not to appear in the boltzmann factor for the ion distributions .",
    "although these demonstrations were performed explicitly for counterion - only systems , the conclusions are generally believed to hold when salt ions are added@xcite .",
    "thus , many researchers in the electrolyte community consider the weak - coupling theory to mean the pb theory ; in other words , weak coupling is considered synonymous with the validity of the pb theory .",
    "physically , however , a single ion in solution next to a surface of a lower dielectric plate obviously should feel the image charge repulsion even in the absence of any surface charge , and the ion distribution  the probability of finding the ion at any location  should reflect the image charge interaction through the boltzmann factor .",
    "this was the case studied in the pioneering work of wagner@xcite , and onsager and samaras@xcite ( wos ) for the surface tension of electrolyte solutions .",
    "it is rather odd that this interaction should become absent from the boltzmann factor for the distribution of mobile ions in the weak - coupling limit when the surface becomes charged .",
    "it is also rather curious that the image interaction , which is absent from the boltzmann factor in the netz - kandu@xmath0-podgornik ( nkp ) approach@xcite in the weak coupling limit ,  re - emerges \" in the boltzmann factor in the strong - coupling limit , though in a different form ( through a fugacity expansion)@xcite . taking zero - surface charge as the limiting case of the _ physical _ weak - coupling condition , it is clear that the nkp and wos approaches give drastically different descriptions of the same system .",
    "it is also difficult to physically reconcile the absence of the image interaction from the boltzmann factor in the weak - coupling limit with its  re - emergence \" in the strong coupling limit in the nkp approach .",
    "furthermore , ion depletion near a weakly - charged dielectric interface has been observed in monte carlo simulation@xcite as well as predicted by the hypernetted chain approximation ( hnc ) integral equation theory that includes the image charge interactions@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we clarify the origin of these discrepancies by a re - examination of the role of the image charge interaction in the _ physical _ weak - coupling limit .",
    "we show that in the presence of a dielectric discontinuity , the _ physical _ weak - coupling limit is not described by the so - called weak - coupling theory if the latter is meant to be the pb or pb with small fluctuations corrections .",

    "a nonperturbative approach yields a modified poisson - boltzmann equation , where a screened , self - consistently determined image charge interaction appears in the boltzmann factor for the ion concentration for any surface charge density .",
    "the wos theory is an approximation of the more general framework presented here in the special case of zero surface charge .    to see the origin of the boundary layer , we start by an analysis of the relevant length scales for the counterion - only system . consider a charged planar surface at @xmath1 with charge density @xmath2 separating an aqueous solution ( @xmath3 ) from an semi - infinite plate ( @xmath4 ) .",

    "thus , our theory provides both the justification for the wos theory and means for systematically improving the wos theory , for example , by including the mean electrostatic potential generated by the charge separation in salt solutions with unequal valency or other asymmetries between the cation and anions , such as different size and polarizability@xcite .",

    "the presence of the image charge interaction results in a very different picture of the electrical double layer from that provided by the pb theory , and can give rise to such phenomena as like - charge attraction and charge inversion even in the weak - coupling condition@xcite ; these phenomena have usually been associated with the strong - coupling condition . the pb theory has played a foundational role in colloidal and interfacial sciences : the dlvo theory , interpretation of the zeta potential , experimental determination of the surface charge and the hamaker constant , are all based on the pb theory@xcite . with the inclusion of the image charge interaction , some of the well known and accepted results will have to be reexamined .",
