    "there is a considerable interest in the study of mesoscopic cdw structures the characteristic size of which is comparable with the coherence length for the phase or the amplitude of the cdw order parameter . from these studies",
    "it is expected to obtain new informations about the intrinsic coherence of the cdw conduction @xcite .",
    "recent experimental and theoretical investigations have demonstrated the possibility of the observation of quantum interference effects in heterostructures @xcite and nanostructures @xcite in cdw materials .",
    "progress in mesoscopic cdw studies is foreseeable with the recent development of epitaxial thin film technology @xcite combined with electron lithography technique . in the present publication",
    ", we report on cdw transport in submicron structures patterned on thin single crystal of the cdw quasi one - dimensional ( q1d ) compound nbse@xmath0 .",
    "the idea of the experiment was to carry out the realization of a mesoscopic structure in which cdw motion is localized in an array of small cells with a submicron size , each cell being electrically connected to the neighbouring ones by transverse ( to the chains ) conduction .",
    "we show in fig .  1 a schematic example of such a structure .",
    "the chain direction of q1d nbse@xmath0 is along x axis .",
    "a triangular lattice of holes ( antidots ) is made in such a way that the projection of holes along the y direction overlaps , that provides small units of cdw conduction between neighbouring holes .",
    "the individual cell is shown in fig .  1 as a shaded rectangle .",
    "we selected the most perfect thin nbse@xmath0 crystals with a thickness , @xmath3 , less than 1  @xmath1 m and a relatively large width @xmath4 ( @xmath5  20  @xmath1 m ) .",
    "the width is along the c crystallographic axis .",
    "the nbse@xmath0 crystals were first glued onto a silicon or sapphire substrate using a fluid resist . after baking 10 minutes at 130@xmath6c the residues of resist",
    "were removed by a soft oxygen plasma etching .",
    "the crystal were then thinned using sf6 reactive ion etching down to about 0.5  @xmath1 m thickness .",
    "a 25  nm thin layer of silicon is then deposited by e - beam evaporation to protect the surface of the crystal and insure charge evacuation from the sapphire substrate during the subsequent e - beam lithography .",
    "the desired holes have high aspect ratio : the hole size is 0.4@xmath20.6  @xmath1 m , wall thickness is about 0.2  micron and crystal thickness is 0.5  @xmath1 m .",
    "one therefore needs a sharp metallic mask .",
    "we first spin on a pmma layer of nominal thickness 0.5  @xmath1 m and bake it 160@xmath6c during 10 minutes .",
    "this pmma layer is then patterned by direct writing with the electron beam of a scanning electron microscope and developped .",
    "we prepare a 50  nm aluminum mask by angle evaporation onto the surface of the patterned pmma layer .",
    "the etching of nbse@xmath0 is then achieved in a sf@xmath7 plasma with the aluminum film .",
    "we have checked optically that for most of the samples the depth of etching coincides with the thickness of the crystal itself .",
    "we then remove the aluminum mask by wet etching and the pmma layer in an oxygen plasma .",
    "we have measured two nbse@xmath0 samples with triangular lattice of holes , keeping nearly the same the ratio between the antidot lattice periodicity and the average diameter of the holes .",
    "the scanning electron micrographs in the patterned parts are shown in fig .  2 . the triangular lattice of antidots for sample #  1 ( deposited on a silicon substrate ) as shown in fig .",
    "2a has a periodicity @xmath8  =3  @xmath1",
    "m along the @xmath9 axis and @xmath10  = 3.7  @xmath1 m along the @xmath11 axis .",
    "the hole cross section nearly circular is 1.4  @xmath1 m  x  1.5@xmath1 m . for sample #  2 ( deposited on a sapphire substrate )",
    "the periodicity of the lattice of antidots is @xmath8= @xmath10=0.6@xmath1 m with a rectangular hole cross section with @xmath12=0.3@xmath1 m along the @xmath9 axis and @xmath13=0.4@xmath1 m along the @xmath11 axis ( see fig .",
    "four gold contact pads are then patterned in a second e - beam lithographic step using lift - off technique .",
    "external leads are attached to the gold strips using indium contacts .",
    "the contact geometry is chosen to allow measurements on adjacent patterned and non - patterned zones ( typical length : 100  @xmath1 m ) of the same crystal as drawn in fig .",
    "the microhole structure covers the whole width of the crystal .",
    "the electrical resistance and the differential current voltage characteristics were measured with a 40  hz phase sensitive bridge using the inner probes 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 as voltage probes to compare the properties of the patterned and non - patterned segments .",
    "all the sample parameters are indicated in table 1 .",
    "the processing treatment yields some changes in the properties of the nbse@xmath0 samples . in fig .",
    "4a we show the temperature dependence of a nbse@xmath0 sample before processing and after processing ( essentially the baking of the pmma layer at 160@xmath6c ) .",
    "the consequences of processing are an increase of both peierls transition temperatures ( @xmath14  = 145  k and @xmath15  = 59  k for pure nbse@xmath0 crystals ) , an increase of the resistance at both maxima in the @xmath16 dependence and a larger residual resistance at low temperatures",
    ". however the sample still conserves all the properties of a relatively good quality nbse@xmath0 crystal . after processing but without patterning the resistance ratio",
    "@xmath17 is in range of @xmath1825 - 40 and the threshold electric field for cdw depinning at 50  k is @xmath19  100  mv / cm .    patterning the antidot array",
    "strongly affects the resistance of the nbse@xmath0 sample . in what follows each nbse@xmath0 sample measured",
    "will have been processed on its total surface but only a part is patterned ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "the sheet resistance of the patterned part increases considerably , for instance by a factor 6.5 at room temperature for sample #  2 ; however the peierls transition temperatures are not changed with respect to the unpatterned part as shown in fig .",
    "the effect of patterning is clearly seen in the temperature dependence of the ratio between the resistance of the patterned part and the resistance of the unpatterned part .",
    "prominent features appear near both peierls transition temperatures and at low temperatures below 50  k. the decrease of the resistance of the patterned part below 50  k is largely suppressed for sample # 2 with the shorter antidot lattice periodicity .",
    "thus , the resistance ratio between room temperature and helium temperature is 10 for sample #  1 and 4.8 for sample #  2 ( to be compared to 25 - 40 for the unpatterned zone ) .",
    "5 shows the variation of the differential resistance @xmath20 as a function of the applied current for both non - patterned ( fig .",
    "5a ) and patterned ( fig .",
    "5b ) parts of sample #  2 .",
    "cdw motion occurs above a threshold electric field @xmath21 defined as @xmath21  = @xmath22  = @xmath23 with @xmath24 the ohmic resistance , @xmath25 the distance between electrodes and @xmath26 the critical current at which non linearity in the ( @xmath27 ) characteristics appears .",
    "it can be noted that @xmath26 for the lower cdw is nearly identical for the patterned and unpatterned parts as shown in fig .",
    "we will now describe a simple model in order to explain the properties of submicronic structures patterned on a single nbse@xmath0 crystal .",
    "we consider that : 1 )  transport along chains occurs only in the short cells located between neighbouring holes ( shaded part in fig .  1 ) and 2 )",
    "transport from one cell to the adjacent one requires charge motion perpendicularly to the chains .",
    "one can imagine an equivalent scheme which consists in an electrical network with two types of resistances : one , @xmath24 , for transport along the chains , the other , @xmath28 , for transport across the chains as drawn in fig .  7 .",
    "the ratio between the sheet resistance of the patterned part , @xmath24 , and that of the unpatterned one , @xmath29 , @xmath30 can be expressed as a linear function of @xmath31 , which is proportional to the resistivity anisotropy @xmath32 ( @xmath33 : resistivity along the width of the sample , @xmath34 : resistivity along the chain axis ) .",
    "thus , @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are coefficients depending on the geometry of the network . in the case",
    "where @xmath38  1 and @xmath39 which is appropriate in the present case , one can write : @xmath40 for sample #  2 , we find @xmath41  = 6.5 at room temperature .",
    "using the value of @xmath42  15 measured at room temperature in nbse@xmath0 @xcite , one obtains @xmath37  = 0.43 .",
    "the justification for the validity of our conduction model is shown in fig .",
    "8 where we have drawn the temperature dependence of @xmath43 with @xmath37  = 0.43 and that of the resistivity anisotropy @xmath32 measured in @xcite using the montgomery technique .",
    "a good agreement between the temperature dependence of both quantities is found in the full temperature range above @xmath44  55  k ( remember that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are larger in our processed samples ) . at lower temperatures , eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] is unvalid , because the additional contribution to the resistance due to the patterned structure .",
    "we consider that the origin of this additional contribution comes from the additional scattering in the mesoscopic units , when the mean free path , @xmath47 , becomes comparable at low temperatures to the length of the unit along the chains .",
    "using the data from @xcite for the carrier mobility along chains , we estimate that @xmath47 is @xmath18  0.3  @xmath1 m at @xmath48  = 40  k. below this temperature , the increase of @xmath47 becomes limited by the antidot periodicity . that can explain the decrease of the residual resistance ratio from 10 ( sample #  1 ) to 4.8 ( sample #  2 ) when the antidot lattice periodicity along the @xmath9 axis is reduced from @xmath8=3@xmath1 m ( sample #  1 ) to 0.6  @xmath1 m ( sample #  2 ) .",
    "we consider now the cdw depinning in a network structure .",
    "the threshold we have defined in part  3 corresponds to a value averaged over the whole structure .",
    "let it to be noted as : @xmath49  = @xmath50 .",
    "however , it is also possible to define a local threshold field , noted as @xmath51 , in an elementary cell : the shaded rectangle for the patterned part as shown in fig .  1 with dimensions @xmath52 along the @xmath9 axis and @xmath53 along the @xmath11 axis . if the elementary cell extends half the distance between units along @xmath9 axis as represented in fig .  1 , then @xmath52  =  @xmath8 and @xmath53  =  @xmath54-@xmath55 .",
    "for the unpatterned part , the elementary cell is larger with dimensions @xmath8 along the @xmath9 axis and @xmath10 along the @xmath11 axis .",
    "@xmath51 is connected with the local current @xmath56 , along the chains in that elementary cell such as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the linear conductivity along the chains and s the cross section of the sample .",
    "the ratio between @xmath51 in the patterned part and the threshold field of the non - patterned part , that one notes as @xmath59 , can be expressed as follows : @xmath60    one then makes the reasonable assumption that the local @xmath61 is the same than the average value for the whole sample @xmath62 . + for sample #  2 we have shown the temperature dependence of @xmath63 and @xmath64 in fig .",
    "the temperature variation of @xmath65 for sample #  1 and #  2 are drawn in fig .",
    "9 .    for sample #  1 , with a larger cell size ( @xmath13  = 1.4  @xmath1 m , @xmath12  = 1.5  @xmath1 m )",
    ", we find that @xmath66 with no significant temperature dependence .",
    "for this sample , @xmath67 ; one neglects any size effect for @xmath58 such as @xmath68 . then @xmath69 not far from the value of 1 .    for sample #  2 , with @xmath12  = 0.3  @xmath1 m and",
    "@xmath13  = 0.4  @xmath1 m , we measure @xmath70=1.2 ( fig .  9 ) . with @xmath71",
    "= 3 , one gets @xmath72 , demonstrating that there is a well pronounced size effect for the local @xmath51 in a cell with submicron size .",
    "similar size effects have been previously observed in tas@xmath0 single crystals with a very small cross section @xcite and a short length @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of our study is the conduction due to cdw motion in a submicron unit .",
    "the process of conversion of the normal carrier current into a cdw current is still not well understood . in several theoretical models",
    "the conversion process is accompanied by auto - localization of carriers @xcite , formation of phase - slippage centers @xcite , dynamical amplitude solitons @xcite , tunneling between solitons under the barrier @xcite .",
    "+ phase slippage at current injection electrodes has resulted from experiments in which the variation of the threshold voltage was studied as a function of the distance between electrodes .",
    "it was found @xcite , that : @xmath73    the first term corresponds to the bulk pinning due to impurities and the extra term @xmath74 was interpreted as the potential necessary for the nucleation of a cdw dislocation loop for conversion of normal current into the cdw condensate .",
    "typically for nbse@xmath0 @xmath75 is in the range of 0.2 - 0.5  mv at t  =  40  k @xcite .",
    "+ one can estimate the threshold voltage in our elementary cell of the patterned zone .",
    "the local critical current is the total critical current @xmath63 divided by the number of channels along @xmath11 axis .",
    "the resistance of the elementary cell can be calculated according to its dimensions and the conductivity at the given temperature .",
    "thus , one estimate that at 40@xmath1850  k , the threshold voltage in the elementary cell is in the range of 50@xmath18100  @xmath1v , much less than @xmath75 .",
    "one are led to conclude that in our network geometry with submicronic dimensions where the current is fed to the elementary cell without any interface with a normal metal , there is no vortex dislocation loop generated .",
    "+ the other models @xcite estimate the conversion length , @xmath76 , to be of the order of @xmath77 ( @xmath78 : the cdw gap ) .",
    "an estimate of @xmath76 for nbse@xmath0 is @xmath18  20  nm .",
    "one can expect to determine a value of the conversion length from experiments on short samples with a length @xmath52 comparable with @xmath76 .",
    "in such a short sample only a part of the length of the sample , @xmath52-@xmath79 , contributes to the non - linear conduction . a comparison with a macroscopic sample with the same thickness and the same ratio length / width can be made .",
    "it is then expected that in small samples the maximum contribution to the non - linear conduction will be at least @xmath80 smaller .",
    "we have measured the non - linear properties in the current regime where the cdw conduction saturates i.e. @xmath81 for both patterned and unpatterned parts of sample #  2 .",
    "we obtain that the cdw conductivity in an individual cell , @xmath82 , is always smaller in the patterned part of the sample with respect to the value in the non - patterned part of the same sample , @xmath83 .",
    "10a shows the temperature dependence of @xmath84 . making the suggestion that this ratio @xmath85 is a measurement of @xmath80 ,",
    "one can estimate @xmath86 as equal to @xmath87 .",
    "that yields a value of @xmath76 of @xmath18  10 - 20  nm the temperature variation of which is drawn in fig .",
    "this estimate of @xmath76 is in reasonable agreement with the theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "we have realized submicron antidot arrays in thin single nbse@xmath0 crystals . the comparison between the transport properties respectively in the patterned and unpatterned parts of the crystal reveals specific features of ohmic conduction and cdw transport in submicron units .",
