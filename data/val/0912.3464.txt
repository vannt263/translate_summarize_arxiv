    "more than forty years ago , kolmogorov @xcite and chaitin @xcite laid the foundations of algorithmic information theory , by introducing the concept of algorithmic information content , or kolmogorov complexity , for a given string of information @xcite .",
    "this measure of complexity is defined as the length of the shortest possible program on a universal computer that will output the string in question . here",
    "we propose a conceptually analogous measure of the complexity of any connected physical structure . instead of a universal computer which translates a program into a string of information , we consider a general framework of self - assembly rules , which act together to create a physical object .",
    "the ` program ' now is our set of self - assembly building blocks and rules , the ` computer ' is given by the physical interactions of the self - assembling building blocks , and the ` output ' is the final structure . using this approach we investigate the physical complexity of shapes in two and three dimensions , including polyominoes , molecules and protein complexes .",
    "our work generalizes ideas first explored in @xcite , and opens them up to a wide range of applications .",
    "furthermore , in the context of protein complexes it offers the kind of biological application of information - theoretic concepts demanded in @xcite .",
    "there are many examples of self - assembling structures in physics , chemistry and biology @xcite .",
    "examples include thin films @xcite , micelles @xcite , viruses @xcite and dna @xcite .",
    "our aim is to introduce a general framework for the theoretical study of self - assembling structures .",
    "this framework can be used to study the properties of real self - assembling systems , but , more generally , it can also be used to measure the physical complexity of any construct , self - assembling or not .",
    "the exact nature of the self - assembly framework depends on the underlying physical system , but it always contains two basic ingredients : a set of building blocks and a set of rules .",
    "we shall call this combination an _ assembly kit _ @xmath0 .",
    "each building block @xmath1 has @xmath2 interfaces , which typically are subject to geometric constraints ( depending on the physical system ) . attached to each interface @xmath3 of a given building block @xmath1 is an integer @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath5 possible values of these integers are the _ colours _ of these interfaces .",
    "the number of distinct colourings of the building blocks depends entirely on the geometry of the problem .",
    "the second ingredient of the assembly kit is the set of rules , which takes the form of an interaction matrix between colours . in the simplest case",
    "this matrix is binary , where 1 signifies attraction and 0 signifies no interaction at all .",
    "many more sophisticated interaction matrices involving repulsion and a continuous spectrum of energies are easily imaginable .    for any system of self - assembling particles",
    "we need to also specify a model for the actual assembly process .",
    "a convenient choice is a model assuming a single nucleus in solution @xcite , which makes the assumption that each disjoint object has one fixed nucleus building block which is surrounded by a solution containing a freely moving population containing many copies of each type of building block .",
    "each time step ( i ) a fixed building block , ( ii ) a site adjacent site to it , ( iii ) a random rotational orientation , and ( iv ) a building block from the solution are chosen at random , and the new , randomly rotated building block becomes fixed to its position if the rules allow it . note that some assembly kits always assemble into the same shape - these we call ` deterministic ' - while ones which contain ambiguous rules are ` non - deterministic ' .",

    "polyominoes_. a polyomino ( also known as a _ lattice animal _ ) is a set of connected sites on a ( typically square ) lattice @xcite .",
    "these connected sites are our self - assembly building blocks .",
    "every building block has four sides ( so that @xmath6 for all @xmath1 ) , which are painted with one of @xmath5 colours .",
    "these colours can attract each other or not , as encoded in a @xmath7 binary interaction matrix .",
    "each distinct way of colouring a building block corresponds to a different building block _ type_. we do not regard rotated colourings as distinct .",
    "the geometry of the 2d lattice gives rise to a particular set of building block colourings in the context of self - assembly .",
    "if we have @xmath5 colours , the total number of such colourings is @xcite : @xmath8 these particular colourings are also known as _ necklaces _ , which can be defined as equivalence classes of strings under rotation @xcite .",
    "the definition of necklaces used here assumes that the building blocks have a fixed chirality - in other words that the necklaces which the colours form on the building blocks are _",
    "fixed_. necklaces @xcite . in general",
    "we will assume fixed chirality . ]",
    "every deterministic assembly kit @xmath9 , which always assembles into a structure @xmath10 , requires a certain amount of information @xmath11 to describe it in some given language @xmath12 .",
    "our aim is to minimize this quantity , as we define the length of the description of the _ minimum assembly kit _ @xmath13 as the _ complexity _ @xmath14 of structure @xmath10 : @xmath15 in analogy to the concept of kolmogorov complexity .",
    "any symmetry or modularity which the structure @xmath10 contains decreases the amount of information required to describe the structure and will therefore be reflected in its minimum assembly kit @xmath13 , and by extension in the value of @xmath14 .",
    "if a minimum assembly kit is deterministic , an interaction matrix @xmath10 ( with elements @xmath16 ) between a total of @xmath5 colours , of which @xmath17 self - interact , can be rewritten as : @xmath18 \\delta_{i(j+1 ) } + ( i \\ , { \\rm mod } \\ , 2 ) \\delta_{i(j-1)}\\ ] ] for @xmath19 , and @xmath20 otherwise , so that one colour always only interacts with one other colour . with this constraint ,",
    "the amount of information , in bits , required to describe a self - assembly kit @xmath9 , with @xmath21 building block types , is : @xmath22 the first term relates to the number of self - interacting colours , the second measures the information required to describe which @xmath23 colours out of the total of @xmath5 colours appear on building block @xmath1 , and the third term @xmath24 measures the information describing the distinct arrangement of the @xmath23 colours on the @xmath2 faces of building block @xmath1 . for a general building block with @xmath2 labelled faces , @xmath25 takes the form of : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and the @xmath28 signify the number of times colour @xmath3 occurs on block @xmath1 .    for polyominoes @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of necklaces with",
    "_ exactly _ @xmath23 colours , given by @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "it follows that @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . as before ,",
    "the complexity @xmath14 of polyomino @xmath10 is the minimum of @xmath11 over all possible assembly kits @xmath9 .",
    "note that wang tiles @xcite are a special case of self - assembling polyominoes .",
    "the tile system described in @xcite is also similar to our framework for the case of polyominos , but ( like wang tiles ) only considers self - interacting colours , and treats rotated tiles as distinct . as a result our encoding , based on necklaces , makes symmetry and modularity in the structure more directly measurable .",
    "if the faces are geometrically unconstrained - as one would imagine for a node with a set of freely moving links - and hence unlabelled , we would only need to specify how much there is of each colour .",
    "this can be written using @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 .",
    "however , this only works under the condition that multiple connections between the same pair of building blocks are prohibited .",
    "the general algorithm we use to find the minimum assembly kit @xmath38 , and thus the complexity @xmath39 , for polyominoes and other structures is described in the following section .",
    "below we describe a general algorithm for minimizing the assembly kit size for a connected physical structure without relying on steric effects . taking these into account can minimize the assembly kit even further , but their computation is highly dependent on the geometry of the system and in most cases non - trivial ( see discussion ) .",
    "note also that in some structures , such as polyominoes , some edges of the contact graph can be redundant in the context of the assembly process . whether contact graph edges in general can be redundant or not depends on the nature of the structure and the assumptions connected to the self - assembly of that structure ( see discussion ) .",
    "similarly , when interfaces are defined by geometry , as for the four sides of a polyomino building block , it makes sense to introduce a neutral colour ( @xmath40 below ) . in systems with a varying number of interfaces on the building blocks ,",
    "neutral colours are usually not required ( @xmath41 ) .    to minimize the assembly kit we take the following steps :    1 .",
    "divide the structure into building blocks ( usually a natural division ) .",
    "the number of building blocks is the _ size _ of the structure , denoted @xmath42 .",
    "2 .   determine the equivalence of these units in terms of any additional criteria ( e.g. types of atoms , proteins ) .",
    "this categorization is the @xmath43 of building block .",
    "3 .   establish a contact graph @xmath16 for the units ( in some cases , such as molecules , this may require setting a distance cutoff ) .",
    "if edges can be redundant : _ consider the space of all spanning subgraphs of this graph .",
    "5 .   for the contact graph ( in the case of no redundant edges ) or each subgraph ( if redundant edges exist ) : 1 .",
    "classify the ( sub)graph according to the number of connections and ( depending on the geometry ) the arrangement of connections .",
    "2 .   label all nodes which are not yet labelled and which have exactly one unlabelled node among their neighbours .",
    "the new labels distinguish nodes according to their species as well as the topologically distinct label distributions among their neighbours.[rep ] 3 .   repeat step [ rep ] until all nodes are labelled or no more nodes can be labelled .",
    "all labelled nodes we define as _ category 1 _ nodes and any remaining unlabelled nodes ( i.e. nodes with at least two unlabelled neighbours ) are defined as _ category 2 _ nodes .",
    "label all category 2 nodes simultaneously according to their neighbourhoods.[rep2 ] 6 .",
    "repeat step [ rep2 ] , using the previous labellings to distinguish neighbourhoods , until labellings are stable .",
    "these final labels , for nodes in both categories , denote the building block _ types_. the number of final labels , or types , is @xmath21 .",
    "these can be subdivided in to @xmath44 category 1 building block types and @xmath45 category 2 building block types .",
    "the category 2 type of block @xmath1 is denoted @xmath46",
    "the degree of each building block type @xmath1 in the contact graph ( or subgraph ) is the number of its interfaces @xmath2 .",
    "the total number of colours , including @xmath47 neutral colours , is @xmath48 .",
    "the sum expression gives the number of different types of interfaces which occur between category 2 building block types .",
    "the number of colours @xmath23 on building block @xmath1 is equal to the number of building block types in its contact graph neighbour set .",
    "10 . using @xmath21 , @xmath5 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in equation ( [ info ] ) , calculate the information @xmath51 required to specify this assembly kit , and thus the complexity @xmath39 of the structure.[finish ] 6 .",

    "[ 0.24 ]    [ 0.5 ]",
    "the self - assembly approach can be used to calculate complexity values for any physical structure . in order to demonstrate the broad range of potential applications we determine the complexity of ( a ) molecules and ( b ) protein complexes .",
    "the problem of molecular complexity has been studied extensively over the past seventy years , starting with work by plya @xcite and rashevsky among others @xcite , and culminating in a seminal paper by bertz @xcite .",
    "these approaches are based on shannon entropy rather than algorithmic information theory and focus on symmetries rather than the more general concept of modularity . in molecules , we take atoms to be the building blocks and chemical bonds to be their interfaces .",
    "simple molecules , such as those in figure [ nitro ] , for which we are only interested in the bond connectivity , are an example of a structure in which none of the edges can be regarded as redundant .",
    "this is because , unlike for polyominoes , we are not assuming any inherent geometry for the building blocks . if two atoms play the same self - assembly role but represent atoms of different atomic species , they must be differentiated .",
    "this also goes for atoms connected by different bond types .",
    "for example , in glutamine ( see figure [ nitro ] ) , the oxygen atom connected with a double bond is a leaf of the self - assembly tree just like any of the ( implicit ) hydrogen atoms , but it requires a separate building block .",
    "the two molecules in our example of figure [ nitro ] are the amino acid glutamine and the explosive nitroglycerine , which both consist of 20 atoms .",
    "nitroglycerine however exhibits a much higher degree of modularity , with its three @xmath52 groups , and therefore has a much lower complexity of @xmath53 bits than the glutamine , for which the value is @xmath54 bits .",
    "note that nitroglycerine does not exhibit simple three - fold symmetry , but a more subtle , hierarchical modularity .",
    "such structural features would be harder to discover using traditional approaches to the measurement of molecular complexity @xcite , which do not take a self - assembly perspective and rely on shannon entropy rather than kolmogorov complexity as a measure of complexity .",
    "[ 0.7 ]    many important biochemical structures are _ protein complexes _ , consisting of several individually formed and folded protein _ subunits _ bound together to produce functional cellular machinery .",
    "these subunits may include different types of protein and several copies of the same protein .",
    "the physical structure of protein complexes , as with protein themselves , is important in determining the functionality of the complex .",
    "the manner in which the subunits bond to form the final complex is known as the _ quaternary structure _ of the complex .",
    "the 3dcomplex database@xcite contains a description of the quaternary structures of thousands of protein complexes , in terms of subunit type and inter - subunit bonding .",
    "if we have two proteins which play the same role in the self - assembling structure but are different proteins , we can choose to count them as two different building blocks ( analogous to the aforementioned distinction between atomic species in molecules ) .",
    "in the following analyses we are only interested in the connectivity of proteins ( equivalent to the qs topology level in the 3dcomplex database ) , and therefore do not distinguish between different proteins .",
    "the two protein complexes in our example of figure [ proteincomplex ] are a chaperonin complex ( _ e . coli _ chaperonin groel ; pdb identifier : 1oel ) and an allergen complex ( _ p .",
    "allergen phl p 6 ; pdb identifier : 1nlx ) .",
    "both consist of 14 proteins , but the former displays a much higher degree of symmetry and a much lower complexity value of @xmath55 bits , versus @xmath56 bits for the allergen ( which is still somewhat modular ) .",
    "more complex protein structures require more unique inter - subunit bonds types , compared to less complex structures which can re - use bonds and be constructed through simple repetition of subunits . as an increase in bond types corresponds biologically to the presence of more unique bonding sites on subunit proteins , more complex protein structures",
    "can be thought of as requiring more evolutionary innovation to produce and would therefore be expected to occur less frequently in biological organisms @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is confirmed by figure [ iaincomplex ] , which shows a histogram of complexity values ",
    "normalized by the size of the protein complex , to avoid size effects  for the 15733 protein complexes in the 3dcomplex database @xcite .",
    "the distribution closely ( @xmath57 ) follows a power - law decay .    [",
    "0.65 ]     correlation with a power law decay .",
    "note that in this case we do not distinguish between different types of subunit.,width=302 ]    in both of these cases - molecules and protein complexes - we assume geometrically unconstrained faces for the building blocks ; in other words , we use @xmath58 . while the chemical bonds of atoms and the interfaces of proteins are in fact usually constrained , this information is not part of the structural formula of the molecule or the contact graph of the protein complex .",
    "if this additional level of resolution is required , a more realistic self - assembly model can be constructed , based on the exact three - dimensional characteristics of the atoms or proteins , and using the @xmath59 term specified above .",
    "the self - assembly perspective provides an intuitive definition of the modularity of a structure : if part of the structure appears several times , it still only needs to be encoded once .",
    "this is why modularity and symmetry ( being a special case of modularity ) lead to more efficient self - assembly kits and a lower value of the complexity measure @xmath39 . formally we can define the modularity @xmath60 of a structure of size @xmath42 as the average number of times one of the @xmath21 different building block types in the minimum assembly kit is used in the structure , which is simply : @xmath61 we can furthermore define a _",
    "module _ formally as a connected set of building blocks which appears more than once in a given structure .",
    "note that modules can overlap : a subset of a module could form another module , appearing a different number of times than the whole module .",
    "the molecule in figure [ nitro]a illustrates such a case .    the majority of protein complexes in the 3dcomplex database show high modularity values ( figure [ modular ] ) with a common trend observable along the @xmath62 line , indicating many proteins consist of structures involving two copies of all constituent subunits .    to further illustrate how the complexity @xmath39 and the modularity @xmath60 measure the physical complexity of protein complexes , we consider two of the outliers in the complexity and modularity histograms , the high - complexity 1ohh ( figure [ iaincomplex ] ) and high - modularity 1b5s ( figure [ modular ] ) .",
    "1ohh consists of two copies of bovine f@xmath63-atpase ( itself a protein complex ) in complex with its regulatory protein if@xmath63@xcite .",
    "the regulatory protein binds simultaneously to both copies of the main complex , but slightly asymmetrically , leading to asymmetric interactions being recorded in the 3dcomplex database .",
    "this asymmetry results in extra information being required to describe the combined quaternary structure , and the observed high complexity value .",
    "1b5s is a multienzyme complex consisting of multiple copies of dihydrolipoyl acetyletransferase ( e2p)@xcite .",
    "the e2p protein has the potential to occupy quasi - equivalent positions , as seen in virus structures@xcite , and is also observed to form cubic complexes .",
    "the highly - modular , dodecahedral structure exhibited in 1b5s is an efficient way of grouping many copies of an active protein in a geometry that facilitates enzymatic activity : the large windows in the structure allow passage of the substrate and product between the inner cavity and the substrate .",
    "the structure of the protein subunits allows this structure to be realised with just one building block type , resulting in high modularity .",
    "( number of building block types ) and @xmath42 ( size of the complex ) .",
    "many protein complexes are highly modular , and this is true across a wide range of sizes . in this plot complexes of equal modularity @xmath64 lie on a diagonal line with positive gradient .",
    "the lines are shown for @xmath651 , 2 , and 10 ( @xmath661 , 0.5 , and 0.1 ) .",
    "the sizes of the circles show how many complexes lie at a given position @xmath67 .",
    "the insets show two examples ( with pdb identifiers 1kyo and 1b5s ) , with high and low modularities.,width=302 ]",
    "if we have two structures @xmath10 and @xmath68 with minimum assembly kits @xmath13 and @xmath69 , then the _ joint _ minimum assembly kit @xmath70 is the minimum kit which can assemble both structures if an appropriate subset of building blocks is chosen .",
    "the amount of information required to describe this kit is the _ joint complexity _",
    "@xmath71 of @xmath10 and @xmath68 .",
    "this definition can easily be generalized to more than two structures .",
    "let us define @xmath72 as the subset of @xmath70 which forms structure @xmath10 , and @xmath73 as the subset of @xmath70 which forms structure @xmath68 ( note that e.g. @xmath13 is not necessarily equal to @xmath72 due to the colour minimization ) , so that @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , let us define the _",

    ". then we can write : @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the set theoretic difference operation .",
    "the definition of @xmath78 follows accordingly .",
    "hence we can also define a _ conditional complexity _",
    "@xmath79 , which is the amount of information needed to describe the building blocks in @xmath75 . because the way we describe the assembly kit is additive in the number of building blocks , we can write @xmath80 since @xmath81 is the information required to describe the building blocks in @xmath73 . the relationship between @xmath82 and @xmath81",
    "is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the total number of colours in @xmath70 and @xmath85 is the total number of colours in @xmath69 . because of the minimization of colours , @xmath86 .",
    "hence , if @xmath87 , then @xmath88 .    similarly , we can define a mutual minimum assembly kit @xmath89 , which corresponds to the intersection @xmath90 from this follows the _ mutual complexity _",
    "@xmath91    in order to account for the relative sizes of the structures we compare using these measures , we can define relative versions of the above quantities .",
    "these are _ relative conditional complexity _ : @xmath92 and the _ relative mutual complexity _",
    "@xmath93 note that the latter measure resembles the jaccard index @xcite . for an illustration of joint , mutual and conditional complexity , see figure [ joint_examples ] .    [ 0.45 ]",
    "_ steric effects _  for structures which contain loop structures formed by repeating units , it is possible to exploit steric effects in order to reduce the size of the assembly kit below the minimum size found by our algorithm ( which explicitly excluded such effects in its definition ) .",
    "an example of a steric effect would be a polyomino which is self - limiting in a deterministic way , purely because of the geometric constraints of the building blocks . as long as each distinct type of loop structure is formed by building blocks of a distinct species ( or set of species )",
    ", the amount of information required to describe this structure can be taken to be the same as that required to describe an infinite chain consisting of the same elements .",
    "a simple example is given in figure [ steric ] .",
    "the crucial assumption which has to hold for this simplification to work is that the geometry of the loop is specified by the species ( and , by extension , the geometry ) of the building block . for proteins as building blocks of protein complexes ,",
    "this is a very reasonable assumption . in the case of molecules it would furthermore be possible to simplify the self - assembly kit by introducing building blocks representing common small loop structures , such as carbon rings .    _",
    "multiple nuclei _  in principle one could consider beginning the self - assembly with multiple nuclei in place .",
    "multiple nuclei may , through steric hindrance or modular repetition , be used to achieve certain structures in a more efficient way , using fewer building blocks than a single nucleus would require .",
    "this reduction in complexity may however be countered in practical applications by the difficulty of achieving the required precise relative displacements of nucleus particles .",
    "it is because of these reasons that we have concentrated on a single nucleus model , as the positioning of multiple nuclei makes it much more difficult to construct a general measure of complexity .    within the single nucleus category",
    ", we further distinguish between structure with a _ specified nucleus block _ and those with _",
    "general nucleus blocks_. the former case encompasses those assembly kits which are guaranteed to produce a given output structure if and only if a specified block is used as the nucleus ( in other words , this block is placed on the substrate before other blocks are introduced to the system ) .",
    "general - nucleus assembly kits by contrast will form the same output structure regardless of which block is placed first .",
    "see figure [ nuclei ] for an illustration how specifying a nucleus can reduce the complexity of a assembly kit .",
    "[ 0.45 ]     and @xmath94 blocks can join the open @xmath95 edges that will form .",

    "if modelling assembly in a diffusion - dominated environment , for example , the order in which interacting particles meet can not be specified , so the general - nucleus model is more appropriate . in a controlled environment where a nucleus can be placed to initiate assembly",
    ", the single - nucleus model is applicable .",
    "the two cases correspond to different ` languages ' being used to measure complexity , and so care must be taken in comparative studies to only compare numerical complexity values from within one class .",
    "_ kolmogorov complexity _  our approach to measuring physical complexity is motivated by the concept of kolmogorov complexity .",
    "it is however important to note that while kolmogorov complexity itself is uncomputable due to the halting problem @xcite , our minimum is not .",
    "this is because the runtime of a finite computer program with finite output can be infinite , while the assembly time of a finite shape is always finite @xcite .",
    "it is possible to define the actual kolmogorov complexity of a shape @xcite , but this is uncomputable .",
    "our computable complexity measure @xmath14 forms a bound on this unattainable quantity , and is dependent on the way in which we encode the description of the assembly kit . it therefore is useful for the analysis , classification and comparison of physical structures , as long as we use a consistent encoding .",
    "we present a general approach for measuring the physical complexity of any connected structure , using the language of self - assembly .",
    "this approach is capable of detecting symmetry and modularity in a given structure , because these features significantly decrease the size of the required self - assembly instruction set .",
    "it therefore provides a powerful tool for automated classification and categorization of physical structures .",
    "in addition , the connection between self - assembly and complexity is an argument for the ubiquity of modular and symmetric features in biological systems : since many such systems self - assemble , evolving sets of self - assembly instructions are likely to yield symmetric and modular structures , as the instructions for these are more efficient to evolve ."
