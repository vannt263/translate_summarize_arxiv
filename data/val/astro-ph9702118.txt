    "h1413 + 117 ( @xmath17 ) , and the quasar br12020725 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "f10214 + 4724 was first identified as a luminous infrared galaxy ( rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1991 ) , and has been detected in three transitions of carbon monoxide ( brown & vanden bout 1992a ; solomon , downes , & radford 1992a ) .",
    "it is now known both that this object is gravitationally lensed ( e.g. broadhurst and lehr 1995 ) , and that it harbors an obscured quasar nucleus seen in polarized ( reflected ) light ( goodrich et al .",

    "quasar currently known , has recently been detected in co by ohta et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and omont et al .",
    "the cloverleaf quasar , the subject of this paper , is a qso with classical broad emission lines plus broad absorption troughs in the optical , with an image that is lensed into four spots separated by about @xmath19 .    based on its strong submillimeter continuum emission , indicative of a large mass of cool dust ( barvainis , antonucci , & coleman 1992 ) ,",
    "the cloverleaf presented a good candidate for the study of molecular gas at high redshift .",
    "indeed , co(@xmath8 ) line emission , redshifted to 97 ghz , was searched for and readily detected ( barvainis et al .",
    "1994 ; wilner , zhao & ho 1995 ) . the close similarities in both infrared / submillimeter continuum and co emission properties between the cloverleaf and f10214 + 4724 , and the fact that both have powerful active nuclei , have given rise to models uniting these two objects through orientation / obscuration effects ( e.g. , @xcite ; granato , danese , & franceschini 1996 ) , and have bolstered evolutionary scenarios linking luminous infrared galaxies and quasars in general ( e.g. , sanders et al .",
    "1988 ; wills et al .",
    "1992 ) .    to provide more information on the state of the interstellar medium in the host galaxy of the cloverleaf , we have obtained detections in three new transitions of co , and have made measurements in two transitions of neutral carbon and one of hcn .",
    "we present these results , together with models for the emitting gas , below .",
    "the observations were carried out using the iram 30 m telescope on pico veleta , spain , during observing runs in 1994 june ( two nights ) and 1995 may ( seven nights ) , and with the plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) , near grenoble , france , during 1996 . at the 30 m",
    "the weather was mainly clear during both runs , but occasional high winds during the 1995 run resulted in some downtime .",
    "spectral data were obtained in the 3 mm , 2 mm , and 1 mm bands simultaneously , using sis mixer receivers and filterbank or acousto - optical backends of 512 mhz bandwidth .",
    "system temperatures derived using the chopper wheel method were typically 250 k , 200 k , and 400 k in the 3 mm , 2 mm , and 1 mm bands respectively .",
    "double position switching was employed to provide flat baselines , with subreflector nutation at a rate of 0.5 hz .",
    "clear detections were obtained in four co transitions : @xmath20 .",
    "peak antenna temperatures were in the range 48 mk .",
    "@xmath9co(@xmath21 was searched for but not detected .",
    "a similar line flux and velocity width for the @xmath22 line was obtained by wilner ( 1995 ) .",
    "the 76 single - dish measurement presents a problem , because of the limited available bandwidth of 512 mhz .",
    "corresponding to 680   at 226 ghz , this is not wide enough to provide a zero - level baseline  even with subreflector nutation the zero level in the raw spectrum can not be trusted .",
    "we will therefore instead use here the pdbi observations of 76 ( for details , see alloin et al .",
    "these also suffer from the same limited bandwidth , but for interferometer observations the zero level should be accurate . to derive the total intensity ( jy ) of the line for comparison with the other co transitions it is necessary to fit the line with a gaussian , but the line width is poorly constrained since the line wings are cut off at the band edges . fixing the linewidth to the mean of the other three co transitions , @xmath23 , we obtain @xmath24 jy  ( the error is statistical only , and does not include 10% calibration uncertainty ) .    the spectra are shown in figure 1 , in units of flux density .",
    "table 1 gives line parameters and upper limits as derived from gaussian profile fits to the 30 m spectra [ except for 76 , where the line parameters are estimated as described above ] .",
    "the line luminosities are given in two ways : @xmath25 , in units of solar luminosities , and @xmath26 in units of k km",
    "s@xmath27 pc@xmath28 ( see solomon , downes , & radford 1992a for definitions and formulae for computation ) .",
    "@xmath26 is proportional to line brightness ( rayleigh - jeans ) temperature integrated over the area of the source , and assuming that the co lines arise in the same general volume this quantity can be used to form line brightness temperature ratios to constrain physical conditions in the gas ( see below ) .",
    "observations were also made of the neutral carbon fine structure lines 10  and 21  ( rest frequencies 492.161 ghz and 809.343 ghz , respectively ) .",
    "a detection in the former made in the 1994 run repeated with reasonable consistency in 1995 , and the average of all good scans from both years is shown in figure 1 .",
    "confidence in this detection is enhanced by the similarity in redshift and line shape to the co lines ( table 1 ) .",
    "also , the line repeated after a shift in observing frequency which placed it in a different part of the filterbank . in 21 , only an upper limit was obtained ( table 1 ) .    finally , we observed 43  during the 1995 run .",
    "we report a tentative detection of a line with peak flux density of 5.5 mjy ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the total integration time for this observation was about 30 hours .",
    "although this line is near the limit of detectability for the 30 m telescope , as in the case of 10 we are encouraged by the similarity of the line parameters to those of co.    some comments on the uncertainties in the observed line ratios are in order .",
    "in addition to the formal errors from noise in the measurements , it is necessary to include the systematic errors .",
    "conversion from antenna temperature in kelvins to flux density in janskys was done using standard calibration factors for the 30 m telescope derived from observations of planets and other standard sources .",
    "the errors in these factors are estimated to be @xmath29 for the @xmath8 line and @xmath30 for the @xmath5 and @xmath10 lines ( c. kramer , private communication ) .",
    "for the pdbi observations of 76 the calibration uncertainty is estimated at 10% . including the systematic and statistical errors , the co line rayleigh - jeans brightness temperature ratios relative to the strongest line , co(@xmath5 ) , are then : @xmath31 , @xmath32 ;",
    "these ratios are computed from the @xmath26 values given in table 1 .",
    "the co lines are characterized by a constant or increasing brightness temperature in going from @xmath22 to @xmath34 , followed by a decrease in the higher-@xmath35 transitions .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that the brightness temperatures are the same for all transitions , since the line ratios differ from predicted thermal r - j values by only @xmath36 in each case . in the case of thermal line ratios we would be able to say little about the column density or temperature of the gas .",
    "however , below we will assume that our measured values represent the true line brightnesses , and use them to model physical conditions in the gas .",
    "this exercise suggests that the line optical depths are modest , with @xmath37 a few or less .    in modeling the co line ratios",
    ", we calculate the excitation of the co molecules using a non - lte scheme which employs mean escape probabilities to include the effects of radiative trapping on the excitation of the co ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) ; the results depend on the density @xmath38 of , the gas kinetic temperature @xmath39 , and the co column density per unit linewidth /.",
    "we note in passing that in non - lte models using the essentially equivalent lvg approximation , the ratio of co abundance to velocity gradient  which fixes the optical depths  is often set to a value appropriate to galactic molecular clouds ( e.g. , solomon , downes , & radford 1992a ) , which is not _ a priori _ justifiable when the physical conditions in the gas may be radically different .    in figure 2",
    "we show the allowed ranges in @xmath38 and /  for three temperatures , @xmath40 , 100 , and 300 k ; the allowed ranges are the hatched regions within the curves",
    ". a temperature of 60 k is the minimum acceptable temperature .",
    "we have also imposed the constraint that the brightness temperature of the 76  line must be at least 40 k. kpc ( assuming @xmath41 ) , where @xmath42 is the magnification of co in image c of the quad ( @xmath43 is the total magnification for all four images ) . the exact relation between @xmath44 and the estimate of the true source radius @xmath45 is model dependent  here we have assumed that lensing stretches the source predominantly in one dimension ; see burke et al ( 1991 ) for an illustration of distortions expected in a quad lens",
    ". given these assumptions , the minimum brightness temperature in the 76line ( that is , for unit areal filling factor ) is @xmath46 k , independent of @xmath47 . ]",
    "this constraint can in principle eliminate a number of models which satisfy the line _",
    "ratios_. for the high temperature models , the allowed range in density is a factor of @xmath48 , while for @xmath40 k any density greater than @xmath49 is allowed .",
    "the acceptable range of /  increases from about a factor of two ( @xmath40 k ) to a factor of seven ( @xmath50 k ) .    at @xmath40",
    "k , the line ratio constraints can be satisfied for thermalized level populations ( which is why there is no upper limit to the acceptable density ) , provided that the optical depth is not too large ( @xmath51 ) : otherwise the line ratios would simply be the ratio of rayleigh - jeans brightness temperatures for @xmath40 k , which is too large compared to the observed line ratios . for ( 7 - 6)/(4 - 3 ) , compared with the observed value of @xmath52 . at 300 k ,",
    "the thermal r - j ratio is 0.98 . ]",
    "thus the ratio of the optical depth terms ( @xmath53 ) must be less than one , which requires that the optical depths are not much greater than unity and that @xmath54 is less than @xmath55 .",
    "the sharp cutoff in @xmath56 at the high end is the result of this optical depth restriction ; the boundary is nearly vertical because , except at the lowest densities , the rotational levels are thermalized through @xmath57 for all the densities .    at high temperatures",
    "the line ratios are matched by somewhat different physics .",
    "thermalized levels are unlikely , as the high@xmath58 lines would then be too strong relative to @xmath34 no matter what the optical depths .",
    "the observed fall - off to the higher @xmath35 lines can still be matched in this case , provided that the level populations are subthermal ; in particular , the excitation temperatures @xmath59 of the @xmath60 and @xmath57 levels must be well below that of @xmath61 .",
    "this restricts the density from being too large , and in fact there is only a narrow range ( at a fixed temperature ) at which the line ratio constraints are satisfied .",
    "in addition , the optical depths are also restricted from being too large , as otherwise radiative trapping would inhibit the required decrease in the excitation temperature .",
    "it is really the drop in @xmath59 that is crucial , as the optical depths may actually _ increase _ from the @xmath8 line to the @xmath11 line ; the drop - off in line flux is then due to the fact that @xmath62 is less than @xmath63 unity for the @xmath57 level , while @xmath64 is non - negligibly larger than @xmath65 .",
    "there is a systematic trend in the line ratios ; the model values approach the maximum allowed observational values with increasing @xmath56 .",
    "the maximum optical depth in the 43  line is generally @xmath66 .",
    "the relatively low optical depths are mandated by the low value of the @xmath67 and @xmath68 ratio , as outlined above .",
    "this result is unusual in comparison to galactic molecular clouds , where the optical depth in the co @xmath69 line ( the most frequently observed transition ) is generally inferred to be large .",
    "however , modest optical depths in the co rotational transitions appear to be common in starburst galactic nuclei ( @xcite ) , for the same reason as in our models of the co emission from the cloverleaf : the elevated gas temperatures ( @xmath70 k ) distribute the molecules over a much larger number of rotational levels .",
    "in addition , since the cloverleaf is at a redshift @xmath71 , it is possible that the gas - phase metallicity is considerably below the solar neighborhood value , which will affect the co abundance and emission ( e.g. maloney & wolfire 1996 ) .",
    "a clear prediction of our single - component co models is that the  line should be weak compared to the 32  line , with a brightness temperature about one - third that of the @xmath8 line ; this is a consequence of the increase in optical depth with @xmath35 up to @xmath72 or 5 .      our upper limit on the intensity of the ci 809 ghz line gives an upper limit to the 21/10  ratio of @xmath73 ( here using luminosities @xmath25 expressed in @xmath74 ) .",
    "we have calculated the expected ratio of these lines as a function of density , @xmath39 , and @xmath75 , as for the co lines .",
    "the upper limit to the 809/492 ratio is only significant for gas temperatures @xmath76 k , where it restricts the gas densities to be @xmath77 @xmath4 .",
    "thus in principle , the ci emission can arise from the same regions which produce the co emission , as delineated in figure 2 .",
    "the observed ratio of luminosities @xmath25 in the ci 492 ghz and 32lines is approximately 0.5 ( table 1 ) . in order to match this ratio ,",
    "the column density per unit linewidth of neutral carbon must be @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , if the co and ci emission arise from the same regions , the neutral carbon abundance is comparable to or a few times larger than that of co. this unusually high ratio of c to co is a reflection of the rather low ratio of @xmath56 required to match to co line ratios .",
    "we can compare the ci / co ratio for the cloverleaf with the _ cobe _ results for the milky way ( @xcite ) , and extragalactic detections of the 492 ghz line in ic 342 by @xcite , and in m82 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "relative to the co @xmath81 line , the flux in the 492 ghz ci line is @xmath82 ( ic 342 ) and @xmath83 ( milky way ) .",
    "if the co lines are optically thick , the ratio of the ci line to the co transitions will scale as @xmath84 in the high - temperature limit , so that relative to the 32  line these flux ratios are 0.4 ( ic 342 ) and 0.7 ( milky way ) , similar to the value of 0.5 seen in the cloverleaf . from @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the ratio in m82 is 0.7 .",
    "@xcite conclude that the ratio seen in ic 342 and the milky way is consistent with the bulk of the emission arising in photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , although @xcite and @xcite argue that the ratio is too large compared to standard pdr models ; the ci intensity can be enhanced if the pdrs are clumpy or the cosmic - ray flux is very high .",
    "although the ci and co emission in the cloverleaf probably do not arise in pdrs ( see  3.3 and  4 ) the similarity in the line ratios is probably a reflection of a similarity in the physical conditions : relatively high temperatures and densities , optically thin ci emission , and ( marginally ) optically thick co emission .",
    "our tentative detection of 43  indicates a luminosity @xmath26 ( in k km s@xmath27 pc@xmath28 ) relative to the 43  line of about 0.25 , which is similar to the 10/  ratio seen in ultraluminous galaxies ( @xcite ) . except for @xmath85",
    "k , the lowest allowable value , the maximum allowed densities in the co - emitting region ( @xmath86 ) are far below the effective critical density required to thermalize the 43  line [ @xmath87 ; even for the 10  line , the critical density is @xmath88 at these temperatures ] . in this case",
    "the ratio of hcn and co luminosities is essentially determined by the sub - thermal excitation of the hcn .",
    "( this is also true for models with @xmath40 k unless the density is extremely high . )",
    "this is not a very satisfactory explanation , however , as it requires fine - tuning of the gas parameters to match the observed ratio , and does not explain why a ratio of order 0.2 is characteristic of ultraluminous galaxies .",
    "a similar constraint arises from the failure of wilner ( 1995 ) to detect the hco@xmath89 @xmath90 line , implying that most of the gas is not at densities above the effective critical density for this transition , @xmath91 .",
    "it is more probable that this ratio reflects the fraction of the co - emitting region which has a density high enough to collisionally excite the hcn line .",
    "solomon , downes , & radford ( 1992b ) argue that only star - forming regions in molecular clouds have such high gas densities , and that therefore ultraluminous galaxies are powered by star formation .",
    "however , this argument overlooks the fact that in galaxies with powerful active nuclei , such as the cloverleaf and f10214 + 4724 , there is a large minimum gas pressure which is enforced by the radiation pressure from the agn .    assuming that the incident flux from the agn is absorbed in a region which is thin compared to the thickness of a cloud , then in equilibrium the cloud pressure must at minimum equal the absorbed radiation pressure . in terms of @xmath92 , this constraint can be written _",
    "min=210 ^ 10l_44(0.1 ) where the bolometric luminosity of the agn is @xmath93 erg s@xmath27 , the distance of the cloud from the agn is  parsecs , and the fraction of the incident luminosity which is absorbed is . in terms of the gas density rather than @xmath94 , equation ( 1 )",
    "is n_min=210 ^ 8l_44(0.1)t_2 ^ -1 where the gas temperature @xmath95 k. the bolometric luminosity of the cloverleaf is @xmath96 , where @xmath43 is the magnification factor .",
    "modelling of the cloverleaf images suggests that @xmath97 ( @xcite ) but this is uncertain .",
    "equation ( 2 ) predicts that the density will exceed @xmath98 [ enough to collisionally excite the 10  line ] within a radius r=8.810 ^ 2 ( m10)^-1/2 t_2 ^ -1/2 ( 0.1)^1/2 for @xmath99 , needed to excite the 43  line , the numerical coefficient is smaller by a factor of ten .",
    "the apparent line fluxes for transitions which require very high densities to excite are likely to be significantly affected by differential magnification , as they will arise preferentially at small radii .",
    "an alternative possibility which may be generically important in infrared - luminous galaxies  either starbursts or agns  is that the hcn levels are not collisionally excited , but instead are populated through absorption of @xmath7 m photons in the degenerate bending mode ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for optically thin hcn emission ( no radiative trapping ) ,",
    "the criterion for radiative pumping of the 43  line to be significant is that the dust temperature fulfills the condition t_d1025[(487 w+1)]^-1 where the continuum has been assumed to be a planck function multiplied by a dilution / optical depth factor @xmath100 . for @xmath101 , equation ( 4 )",
    "requires @xmath102 k ; for @xmath103 , @xmath104 k. substantial amounts of dust at these temperatures are undoubtedly present in the cloverleaf ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that these two mechanisms predict rather different size scales for the hcn emission ; from equation ( 3 ) , radiation pressure will only keep the gas density high enough to collisionally excite the 43  line to a radius of 100 pc , whereas for a bolometric luminosity of @xmath105 , the dust temperature will be above 250 k to more than 300 pc distance .",
    "we might also expect that in the former case , the hcn and co line profiles could differ significantly ; testing this will require much higher signal - to - noise observations than are presently available .",
    "the presence of a luminous active nucleus appears to have profoundly influenced the state of the interstellar medium in the cloverleaf .",
    "the high line luminosities , the high ratio of ci to co line intensities , and the prominent hcn emission may be the result of the impact of the radiation from the agn on the surrounding molecular clouds .    the mass of gas in the cloverleaf can be estimated from both the co line observations and the ci 492 ghz line .",
    "the total molecular gas mass can be derived from an observed co line luminosity and our detailed model results as m_(co ) = l_co(m_cl/ l_cl ) 215 l_co10 ^ -17(/)(y_co/310 ^ -5)(i_)^-1 where /  is in  km@xmath27 s , @xmath106 is the rest frequency of the transition , @xmath107 is the intensity at line center emerging from a cloud , and @xmath108 is the co abundance by number relative to total hydrogen ; @xmath109 is the mass - to - co luminosity ratio of the clouds from our models . using the observed luminosity of the 32  line of @xmath110",
    ", we find a molecular gas mass @xmath111 , essentially independent of the choice of model , ( except for the highest column density , high - temperature models , where it can be as large as @xmath112 ) .",
    "this is an order of magnitude smaller than the value originally suggested by @xcite , due to the considerably higher emissivity of warm co of modest optical depth .    to estimate the gas mass from the ci emission",
    ", we assume that the 492 ghz line is optically thin . over the allowed range of physical conditions ( see  3.2 ) approximately 40% of the carbon atoms are in the @xmath113 level of the ground @xmath114 state .",
    "using an einstein @xmath115-coefficient of @xmath116 s@xmath27 ( @xcite ) , we find that the mass of hydrogen associated with the ci is then m_hi(ci)1400 l_492(y_c/310 ^ -5 ) where the line luminosity @xmath117 is in  and @xmath118 is the carbon abundance by number .",
    "( in both equations [ 5 ] and [ 6 ] we have normalized to a carbon abundance of @xmath119 solar ; equation [ 5 ] assumes all carbon is in co. ) the observed line luminosity @xmath120 , and so we obtain a gas mass @xmath121 .",
    "if irradiation by the central source is important in pressurizing the clouds , there will be associated dynamical effects , as the radiative momentum imparted to the clouds will provide an outward acceleration . scoville ( 1995 ) suggested that support of the molecular gas against its own self - gravity by radiation pressure could be important in f10214 + 4724 , in order to reconcile the fact that their derived molecular mass exceeds the dynamical mass ( estimated from the measured co size and linewidth ) by an order of magnitude .",
    "we estimate @xmath122 for the cloverleaf from the upper limit to the co source size @xmath45 ( see footnote 2 ) and the observed linewidths : m_dyn1.610 ^ 11 m^-1 h^-1 , where the inclination angle @xmath123 has been taken to be @xmath124 . comparison with the above expressions for the masses derived from co and ci shows that the gas mass is in both cases smaller than the dynamical mass ( assuming , of course , that @xmath45 is not much smaller than the current upper limit , and that the carbon abundance is not much less than @xmath119 solar ) .",
    "although radiation pressure support could be important in the cloverleaf , it is not at present necessary to appeal to it .",
    "the gas mass derived from the ci observations is @xmath125 times larger than the molecular gas mass estimated from co ; either the hydrogen associated with the atomic carbon dominates the gas mass ( plausibly a result of the high x - ray ionization and heating rates within a few kpc of the active nucleus : @xcite ) , or else the ci emission is being differentially magnified by the lensing relative to the co. in either case , the gas mass is substantial , but not extreme , especially as the total magnification @xmath43 may be a factor of ten .",
    "the detectability of the cloverleaf in co and ci would appear to be the result not of an enormous mass of gas , but rather the effects of gravitational lensing and the rather unusual physical conditions ( high emissivities ) in the gas , in consequence of the proximity of a luminous active nucleus .",
