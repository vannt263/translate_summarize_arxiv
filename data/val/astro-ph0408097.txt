    "the use of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) as a tool for cosmological studies became feasible upon the realization that there is a relationship between luminosity and light - curve shape ( phillips 1993 ) . with this knowledge and the advent of wide - field ccd arrays which allow for the efficient discovery of large numbers of sne ia , cosmological investigations into the fundamental composition of the universe using sne ia as probes have revealed the acceleration of the expansion of the universe ( riess et al .",
    "1998 , perlmutter et al . 1999 ) .    in order to derive distance from",
    "observed photometry , numerous factors which alter the light - curve must be taken into account .",
    "any distance measurement technique must calculate the probability of a fit for a sn light - curve in the parameter space of ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath4 ) , where @xmath1=time - of - maximum , @xmath2=extinction , @xmath3=decline rate ( using any of the several current parameterizations of sne ia light - curve shapes  see below ) , @xmath0=redshift , and @xmath4=distance .",
    "we then either marginalize over these factors or take cuts through parameter space at specific values in order to obtain a measurement for @xmath4 , the primary quantity of interest .",
    "the initial discovery of the relationship between light - curve shape and brightness led to parameterization by the rate of decline in @xmath5-band brightness over the 15 days after maximum light ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "a second method , the multi - wavelength light - curve shape ( mlcs ) method ( see riess et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) is based on @xmath7 , the difference in peak brightness between an observed sn and a fiducial light - curve template .",
    "the `` stretch '' method ( perlmutter et al . 1997 ) parameterizes the light - curve by a factor @xmath8 which broadens or narrows a template light - curve in order to modify the light - curve shape .",
    "the bayesian adapted template match ( batm ) method introduced by tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) measures distances through comparison with a large set of well - observed nearby supernovae rather than a parametrized template .",
    "these methods all seem to be fundamentally equivalent for the purposes of measuring accurate distances and resolving uncertainties between the effects mentioned above .",
    "another recently introduced distance measurement technique is cmagic ( wang et al . 2003 ) , which uses the relationship between light - curve shape and brightness in a more indirect way than the above methods .",
    "it utilizes an observed linear relationship in color - magnitude space for extended periods of time after maximum light to estimate distance .",
    "as noted by wang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , cmagic remains under development and a more thorough demonstration of its utility as a distance estimator is necessary .",
    "redshift is an especially problematic parameter .",
    "it broadens the light - curve by ( 1+@xmath0 ) , which affects what we can deduce about luminosity , and also modifies how the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) maps into observed bandpasses , thereby changing the color of the sn ia .",
    "it thus exhibits considerable covariance with other fit parameters , and needs to be known accurately .",
    "redshift is normally measured spectroscopically , which confers the added benefit of confirming that an object is indeed a sn ia . however , for large surveys ( see barris et al .",
    "2004 ) , far more sne are discovered than can possibly be observed spectroscopically .",
    "the situation will get worse with larger surveys such as essence ( smith et al . 2002 ) , the canada - france - hawaii legacy survey ( http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/science/cfhls ) and pan - starrs ( kaiser & pan - starrs team 2002 ) .",
    "there have been several attempts to determine redshift and type for sn through photometric means .",
    "barris et al .",
    "( 2002 ) concluded that over a wide range of redshift , sne ia lie in a narrow region of color - magnitude space , indicating it is likely that tests discriminating between sne ia and ii may be reliable .",
    "riess et al . (",
    "2004 ) constructed cuts based on seds of sne to optimize selection of high-@xmath0 candidates for spectroscopy , distinguishing between the various sn types at high redshifts based on the uv deficit of sne ia relative to core collapse sne . in combination with the photometric colors of the host galaxy , they were also able to make a rough estimate of the redshift of the sne .",
    "barris et al .",
    "( 2004 ) used a similar , although simplified , comparison to argue for the identification of several sne as type ia , despite lacking spectral confirmation .",
    "currently it is not apparent that photometric observations are sufficient to accurately determine the redshift and/or distances of sne ia .",
    "comparisons with seds of sne ia may allow constraints on ( 1+@xmath0 ) on the order of @xmath90.1 , but this is a poor constraint on @xmath0 for @xmath10 .",
    "without knowledge of redshift , the standard methods for determining distance can not be meaningfully applied , since observations must be corrected for cosmological effects such as time - dilation and k - corrections before allowing accurate measurements of other parameters . however , often the quantity of interest is distance .",
    "if @xmath4 may be accurately measured despite a poor constraint on @xmath0 or other parameters , it would be an important breakthrough for cosmological studies using sne .",
    "we describe in this paper a method for determining accurate distances to sne ia without knowledge of redshift , based on marginalizing over @xmath0 .",
    "we have used the batm technique introduced by tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , but the method is not specific to batm and can be employed with any distance estimator .",
    "we describe the necessary steps for implementing the method , and demonstrate that it produces accurate distances for a large sample of hubble flow sne ia . the potential to remove the need for spectroscopic redshifts promises to greatly increase the number of sne that may be used for cosmological analysis , which is of particular importance due to the number of extremely wide - field surveys planned for the near future .",
    "as described above , all distance measurement techniques for sne ia calculate the probability of a fit for a sn as a function of ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath4 ) .",
    "the parameters are either fit as a group or marginalized over , in order to obtain a measurement of @xmath4 .",
    "after marginalizing out parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , one is left with probability as a function of ( @xmath0 , @xmath4 ) . for some questions knowledge of ( @xmath0 , @xmath4 ) probability contours",
    "is very interesting .",
    "the most immediately obvious is for probing cosmological density parameters , which led to the accelerating universe result .",
    "for all conventional distance determination methods , @xmath0 is required to be an input parameter for the reasons described above , providing a final estimate of @xmath4 by evaluating at the known redshift .",
    "one could alternatively treat @xmath0 as a free parameter to be marginalized out . for many questions",
    "there is no added benefit to knowing @xmath0 in addition to distance .",
    "for example , inquiries into rates as a function of distance , galaxy - type , location within the host , or host galaxy properties can be answered based solely upon @xmath4 , rather than @xmath0 .",
    "even with a poor constraint on @xmath0 , in principle we may still be able to measure accurate distances since the effect of redshift on distance comes from dependence on ( 1+@xmath0 ) .",
    "implementation of the redshift marginalization involves several minor modifications to any fitting process .",
    "the most important is that care must be taken to place calculated fit probabilities for each redshift on an equal footing , so that at each step they may be meaningfully combined .",
    "a suitable prior for @xmath0 must also be applied .",
    "the most obvious to consider is to scale by volume , which can be accomplished using a uniform redshift step , weighting each by @xmath0 .",
    "the same prior could be implemented with a uniform step in log @xmath0 , weighting by @xmath11 . a different prior to consider is one constant in @xmath0 , rather than volume , which could be obtained by a linear step in redshift @xmath12 scaling by @xmath0 .",
    "one then iterates over the range of @xmath0 contributing non - negligible values of probability , combining the results to produce a final estimate of @xmath4 .",
    "it is important to note that this redshift marginalization method is @xmath13 simply a restatement of the photometric redshift procedure typically used for galaxies .",
    "photometric redshifts use the observed colors of galaxies in order to produce a likelihood range for the redshift based on template seds .",
    "since galaxies are not standard candles , only a very weak constraint on distance is possible by considering magnitude .",
    "the redshift - independent implementation of a sn ia distance estimator uses observed light - curves in order to produce a constraint on both distance and redshift by considering the magnitude and light - curve shape as well as the color .",
    "this additional information greatly strengthens the power of the method in comparison to galaxy photometric redshifts .",
    "it is also important to stress that this redshift marginalization procedure may be implemented with @xmath14 method for measuring distances to type ia supernovae ( stretch , @xmath15 , mlcs , batm , or any other equivalent method ) . rather than evaluating @xmath4 for the measured spectroscopic redshift",
    ", derived probabilities should be measured for a wide range of @xmath0 , with @xmath0 then marginalized over as is done with other fit parameters .",
    "the batm method for calculating luminosity distances for sne ia was briefly described by tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and barris et al . ( 2004 ) , with a more complete treatment to appear in barris ( 2004 ) .",
    "it is based upon an idealized set of representative sn ia light - curves which are photometrically and spectroscopically well - sampled in time , and for which accurate distances are known .",
    "with such a spectrophotometric template set , predicted light - curves could be produced to compare to observations .",
    "however , data of this quality are extremely uncommon at present , so we use a set of light - curves which have excellent temporal coverage over a range of wavelengths and span a wide range of luminosity , and a large set of observed spectra . for a given redshift ,",
    "the seds are shifted and warped so that they match the observed photometry of each template light - curve .",
    "batm treats the `` template '' and `` unknown '' in a fundamentally different manner from the previous methods .",
    "the seds and light - curves are shifted to the redshift of the sn to be measured , so that redshift effects are @xmath16 to the template set rather than @xmath17 from the observational data .",
    "the idea is to compare the observed sn to what we would expect the template to look like at a given redshift , as opposed to comparing the template to what the sn would look like were it at the redshift of the template .",
    "since in batm it is the template data that is transformed , rather than the observed data , the operation can naturally be performed over a range of redshift , facilitating the implementation of the redshift marginalization .",
    "it should be stressed again that @xmath14 method for measuring distances may similarly be extended by merely iterating the procedure over a range of redshifts , treating @xmath0 as an additional free parameter and marginalizing it out .",
    "we have performed the redshift - marginalization procedure in combination with the batm method for a set of 60 sne ia taken from hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , riess et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and jha ( 2002 ) .",
    "this is a well - observed sample for which we know relative distances via spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "results are shown on a hubble diagram in figure  [ hubcompare ] .",
    "it is important to note that the redshifts used to construct these hubble diagrams were measured spectroscopically , @xmath13 photometrically .",
    "the rms scatter about the best - fit line is 0.21 mags for the @xmath0-free batm distances , compared to 0.19 mags for distances taken from the recent compilation of tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who calculated distances by combining the results from as many methods as possible .",
    "we observe no significant difference in performance between the redshift priors mentioned in the previous section , indicating that neither the redshift prior nor details of its implementation are limiting factors for the method for this sample .",
    "we have therefore used distances calculated with a linear step of @xmath0=0.01 in redshift and weighted by @xmath0 , beginning at @xmath0=0.01 and typically truncated at @xmath0=0.20 , where the probability has become negligible .",
    "we have scaled the uncertainties for the @xmath0-free batm distances in order to produce @xmath18 for the set of 60 sne .",
    "our initial uncertainties were overestimated in comparison to their scatter about the hubble line , as shown by a total @xmath19 value of 40.0 for 60 objects .",
    "we expect that a `` training '' process for batm similar to that used to produce templates for other methods will both alleviate this discrepancy and reduce the scatter about the hubble diagram .",
    "such a procedure would determine how to optimally calculate and combine distance estimates from each of the batm template light - curves , and has yet to be performed .",
    "at present it seems sensible to rescale the uncertainties so that they more accurately reflect the scatter and yield @xmath18 .",
    "uncertainties in figure  [ hubcompare ] reflect this rescaling .",
    "the distance uncertainties from tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) appear to be @xmath20estimated for this set of objects , but we have left them as reported .    the residuals with respect to a hubble line for the two sets of distances are compared in the inset of figure  [ hubcompare ] .",
    "there is a clear correlation between the two methods , indicating that the residuals are due to intrinsic properties of the sne rather than some feature of the redshift marginalization or the batm analysis .",
    "this is further evidence that the redshift marginalization procedure is recovering the same distance information as the established @xmath0-specific techniques .",
    "it is natural to worry about additional possible systematic biases that might be introduced by this method . in figure  [ residscompare ]",
    "we compare the hubble diagram residuals as a function of several sn properties .",
    "there are no evident biases in the redshift - independent distances as a function of extinction , redshift , or light - curve shape .",
    "it is interesting to note that for sne ia at the high ends of the sample distribution of @xmath2 , @xmath0 , and mlcs @xmath7 , the redshift - independent distances appear to be slightly @xmath21 biased than those using redshift - specific methods .",
    "it should in principle also be possible to examine the ( @xmath0 , @xmath4 ) probabilities without marginalizing over @xmath0 . figure  [ dzcontours ] shows contours in ( @xmath0 , @xmath4 ) space for two of our hubble flow sample as well as for two high-@xmath0 sn ia from barris et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . since the @xmath0-free method is sensitive to ( 1+@xmath0 )",
    ", we get very poor constraints on @xmath0 at low redshift , but for @xmath22 , the constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath4 are quite similar , and good enough to begin to differentiate between cosmological models . much further investigation into the correlations between these two parameters is necessary before the accuracy in values of ( @xmath0 , @xmath4 ) is demonstrated as we have done for @xmath4 alone .",
    "we have described a procedure for measuring accurate luminosity distances for sne ia independent of knowledge of redshift by marginalizing over @xmath0 .",
    "this procedure may be used in combination with any distance measurement technique to remove the limitations on supernova surveys imposed by the need for spectroscopic redshifts . when applied as an extension to the batm method",
    ", the redshift marginalization formalism produces a hubble diagram scatter of @xmath230.2 magnitudes , comparable to that using conventional implementations of distance methods , in which knowledge of redshift is required .",
    "further refinement of the batm technique through a `` training '' process , or use with other methods , is likely to reduce the scatter to values equal to that of redshift - specific methods .",
    "distances measured with this method will allow investigation of various properties of sne as a function of distance , which is all that is necessary to answer many fundamental questions .",
    "the rates of sne ia as a function of redshift are still not well constrained ( see pain et al .",
    "1996 , 2002 ; tonry et al .",
    "2003 ) , and likely will remain so due to the difficulty in collecting large numbers of spectroscopic redshift .",
    "however , rates as a function of distance are just as fundamental , and the lack of redshift knowledge will not prevent investigations into the dependence of rates on numerous host - galaxy properties , for instance . for investigations where cosmological parameters may be considered as known , the conversion from distance to redshift is determined , so accurate distances are all that is necessary .",
    "the method may also be used to produce probability contours as a function of ( @xmath4 , @xmath0 ) for high-@xmath0 sne .",
    "this will allow cosmological parameters to be measured based purely upon photometric observations .",
    "such a development will be an important step for cosmological studies based on supernova surveys . in order to accomplish this",
    ", it will be necessary to obtain a sufficient number of observations to properly determine the multi - wavelength light - curve shape to isolate the effects of ( @xmath4 , @xmath0 ) from other fit parameters ( particularly @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and sufficiently constrain the solution space .",
    "the achievable accuracy , and the observational strategy required to reach it , is influenced by both the intrinsic properties of sne ia ( which are not equally `` standard candles '' at all wavelengths  see jha 2002 ) and the quality of temporal and wavelength coverage of nearby sne ia used for distance calibration .",
    "the method described here is more powerful than the photometric redshift procedure used to estimate redshifts for galaxies based on their observed colors , because it also takes into account the magnitude and light - curve shape to produce constraints on both redshift and distance .",
    "it promises to remove the limitations to sn studies caused by the requirement for spectroscopic redshifts for the determination of distances for sne ia .",
    "the ongoing essence ( smith et al . 2002 ) and canada - france - hawaii legacy survey ( http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/science/cfhls ) , and future projects such as pan - starrs ( kaiser & pan - starrs team 2002 ) and the proposed supernova acceleration probe ( nugent 2001 ) will also be able to greatly increase their yields using this method , enhancing their ability to investigate fundamental cosmological questions .",
