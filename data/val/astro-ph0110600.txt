    "the intergalactic medium ( igm ) can be observed in the spectra of distant objects such as quasars through resonant absorption in the lyman-@xmath10 transition of neutral hydrogen ( bahcall & salpeter 1965 ; gunn & peterson 1965 ) .",
    "the availability of high resolution echelle spectrographs on large telescopes ( hires on keck & uves on vlt ) has provided us with data of unprecedented quality over recent years ( see rauch 1998 for a recent review ) . at the same time , a theoretical paradigm within the context of the cold dark matter cosmology has emerged ( e.g. bi , boerner & chu 1992 ) , well tested by numerical hydrodynamical simulations(cen et al .",

    "machacek et al 2000 ) , in which the absorption is produced by volume filling , photo - ionised gas , that contains most of the baryons at redshifts @xmath11 ( see e.g. efstathiou , schaye & theuns 2000 for a recent review ) .",
    "the absorbers are locally over dense extended structures , close to local hydrostatic equilibrium ( schaye 2001 ) .",
    "the combination of a predictive theory and superb data has led to a veritable revolution in igm studies .    on large scales , the gas distribution is similar to that of the underlying dark matter , but on small scales pressure forces smooth the gas distribution , erasing most of the small scale power . combined with thermal broadening and peculiar velocities ,",
    "this results in a strong suppression in the amplitude of the flux power spectrum on scales @xmath12 km s@xmath6 ( e.g. theuns , schaye & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "another consequence of the thermal content of the gas is a cut - off in the distribution of line widths @xmath13 below @xmath14 km s@xmath6 ( schaye et al 1999 ) , which is clearly present in observed line samples as well ( e.g. kirkman & tytler 1997 ) .",
    "both these signatures can be used to infer the igm temperature by calibrating the cut - off using simulations ( schaye et al 1999 , 2000 ; ricotti , gnedin & shull 2000 ; bryan & machacek 2000 ; mcdonald et al 2000 ) .    the igm temperature can be used to constrain the reionization history because the thermal time scales are long in the low density gas probed by the absorption ( miralda - escud & rees 1994 ) .",
    "consequently the gas retains a memory of its heating _ history_. at over densities @xmath15 , shock heating and radiative cooling are unimportant and photo - heating of the expanding gas introduces a tight density - temperature relation @xmath16 ( e.g. hui and gnedin 1997 )",
    ". a sudden epoch of reionization will make the gas nearly isothermal ( @xmath17 ) at a temperature of @xmath18k .",
    "away from reionization , the density - temperature relation steepens again , asymptotically reaching @xmath19 .",
    "the steepening occurs because denser gas has a higher neutral fraction , and hence a larger photo - heating rate . if the heating rate can be computed reliably , given the observed sources of ionising photons , then a measurement of the entropy of the gas can in principle determine the reionization epoch .",
    "if the sources responsible for reionizing hydrogen have a soft spectrum , there may be more than one reionization epoch since helium reionization requires harder photons .",
    "there is some observational evidence that + reionization occurs around @xmath11 , based on the occurrence of large fluctuations in the optical depth ( davidsen et al .",
    "1996 ; reimers et al . 1997",
    "; heap et al . 2000 ) , and the change in hardness of the ionising spectrum as inferred from metal - line ratios ( songaila & cowie 1996 ; songaila 1998 ) .",
    "the interpretation of the optical depth data is not straightforward however ( miralda - scude et al .",
    "2000 ) , and there is some discussion in the literature about the reality and interpretation of the claimed change in metal - line ratios ( boksenberg , sargent & rauch 1998 ; giroux & shull 1997 ) . note that , if reionization does not occur instantaneously , various measures of the abundance change may well find a range of reionization epochs , given that they may sample different over densities .",
    "reionization is not expected to be instantaneous because ionisation fronts expand much faster into low density voids than into the higher density filaments ( e.g. gnedin 2000a ) .",
    "if the sources of ionising photons are bright but scarce , then reionization will not be complete until the large ionised bubbles overlap .",
    "a consequence of such patchy reionization is that different regions might follow different @xmath20 relations and so have different values of @xmath0 .",
    "such temperature fluctuations  may lead to apparent discrepancies between the different algorithms discussed earlier to measure @xmath0 and @xmath21 , since different methods may give other weights to regions in the same spectrum .",
    "the aim of this paper is to test whether the data are consistent with a single well defined @xmath20 relation and to investigate whether reionization can be detected by a jump in temperature .",
    "we use the wavelet analysis proposed by theuns & zaroubi ( 2000 ) , and apply it to a set of high resolution qso spectra spanning a wide range of redshifts .",
    "we use hydrodynamical simulations to demonstrate that our method can detect variations in the amplitude @xmath0 of the temperature - density relation @xmath22 of order 50 per cent , even when these occur on scales as small as @xmath23 km s@xmath6 ( 1000 km s@xmath6 corresponds to @xmath24 co - moving mpc h@xmath6 and a redshift extent @xmath25 at redshift @xmath26 , in the currently popular flat , cosmological constant dominated model with matter density @xmath27 . ) the method presented here does not use simulations to identify regions of different temperatures .",
    "recently , zaldarriaga ( 2001 ) applied a similar analysis to qso 1422 + 231 and showed that a model with two temperatures , that occupy comparable fractions of the spectrum , is constrained to have temperature variations smaller than a factor of 2.5 .",

    "section  4 describes the wavelet decomposition and the statistical tools making use of hydrodynamical simulations to illustrate the approach .",
    "section  5 presents the results , and these are discussed in section  6 .",
    "section  7 summarises . readers not interested in the details of the method can skip directly to section  4.3.1 , which provides an illustration of the method for a simulated spectrum with imposed temperature fluctuations .",
    "in our analysis , we have used data obtained with the high resolution spectrograph on the keck i telescope ( vogt et al . 1994 ) , and uves , the ultraviolet echelle spectrograph on the vlt ( kueyen ) telescope ( d odorico et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we have combined line lists taken from the literature with publically available spectra ( table[table : data ] ) , to obtain a set of eleven high resolution qso spectra that span a wide range of emission redshifts @xmath28 .",
    "high resolution data is required since the lines are intrinsically narrow @xmath14 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the standard data reduction is described in the original references , with the exception of apm  0827 + 5255 which was reanalyzed after calibration of the flux scale to remove echelle order mismatches ( tzanavaris & carswell 2002 ) .",
    "all spectra have signal to noise of 4050 per resolution element , and a similar resolution , @xmath29 . only two out of eleven of these spectra ( qsos apm  0827 + 5255 and 1422 + 293 ) were used in the analysis of the thermal evolution by schaye et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "line profile fitting has been performed on the data .",
    "voigt profiles are fitted to the absorption lines using a @xmath30 minimisation procedure , producing a list of lines with given column density , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , width @xmath13 ( km s@xmath6 ) and absorption redshift @xmath33 . where possible , metal lines have been identified from line coincidences .",

    "a discrete wavelet is a localised function with a finite bandwidth ( see e.g. press et al .",
    "1992 for an introduction and original references to the application of wavelets to a wide variety of problems ) .",
    "this makes wavelets useful for characterising line widths in a spectrum , since the amplitude of the wavelet will be related to the width of the line , and the position of the wavelet to the position of the line .",
    "pando & fang ( 1996 ) used a wavelet analysis to describe clustering of absorption lines .",
    "theuns & zaroubi ( 2000 ) used the daubechies 20 wavelet ( daubechies 1988 ) to characterise temperature fluctuations in a spectrum .",
    "independently , meiksin ( 2000 ) used the same wavelet basis to show that most of the information in a spectrum is carried by a small fraction of the wavelets .",
    "more recently , jamkhedar , bi and fang ( 2001 ) used a multi - scale analysis based on wavelets to better describe the transmission power spectrum taking into account uncertainties in the applied continuum .",
    "discrete wavelets are also a set of orthogonal basis functions",
    ". consequently , we can borrow notation from quantum mechanics to write any function @xmath72 as a sum over its wavelet projections , @xmath73 .",
    "here , @xmath74 is the wavelet function of level @xmath75 , @xmath76 the projection of @xmath72 onto @xmath74 , and @xmath75 the quantum number  of the basis function .",
    "characteristic for wavelets is that they have a finite extent in both the spatial direction , and the frequency domain , i.e. they are like a wave - packet instead of a single momentum wave .",
    "so we ll need two indices to denote a given wavelet basis function , @xmath77 , where @xmath75 denotes the characteristic frequency ( width ) , and @xmath78 the position of the wavelet .",
    "in this paper we will investigate the properties of the spectrum in terms of a given single _",
    "frequency _ of the wavelet , i.e. we will study @xmath79 note that summing @xmath80 over @xmath75 will give back the original function @xmath72 .",
    "we are left to tune the frequency @xmath75 to make it most sensitive to the temperature .",
    "we have chosen to use the daubechies 20 wavelet , as in theuns & zaroubi ( 2000 ) , who give examples of the decomposition of a spectrum in terms of that wavelet .",
    "note that computing the wavelet projection eq .",
    "( [ eq : wvlt ] ) is computationally very similar to performing a fast fourier transform , and many standard computer packages have wavelet transforms built - in .",
    "the usage of wavelets is not very common in astronomy , we would therefore like to note that the computation of the projection eq .",
    "( [ eq : wvlt ] ) requires a handful of programming lines in standard software packages such as idl , and much less than a second of computer time to evaluate . for a given choice of the wavelet , the decomposition eq .",
    "( [ eq : wvlt ] ) is unique .",
    "theuns & zaroubi ( 2000 ) showed that the projection in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wvlt ] ) is already very sensitive to the temperature of the gas , because narrow lines tend to generate larger wavelet coefficients than broader lines , for a suitable choice of @xmath75 .",
    "here we describe four improvements to that method .",
    "\\(1 ) since the @xmath77 are orthogonal basis functions , they change sign at least once , in contrast to an absorption spectrum . in particular , the daubechies 20 wavelet does not look like an absorption line at all , but is more similar to its _",
    "derivative_. so we found it advantageous to project the scaled _ derivative _ of the spectrum @xmath81 with respect to velocity @xmath82 , @xmath83 . here , the velocity  @xmath82 is defined as a function of wavelength @xmath84 through @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the speed of light , and the parameter @xmath87 is introduced to avoid division by zero close to the zero level .",
    "\\(2 ) the positional localisation of the narrow wavelet ( width @xmath88 km s@xmath6 ) that we will use below is far better than what we require to determine a jump in temperature .",
    "we take advantage of this to improve the frequency resolution  and hence the sensitivity to small changes in the line widths  of the wavelet projection at the expense of its localisation by computing @xmath89 so we shift the input function by @xmath90 to the left , @xmath91 , project it onto the wavelet , and shift the result by the same @xmath90 to the right .",
    "we do this for @xmath92 times the wavelet s width , and at each position take the maximum absolute value of the three projections , and denote the result by @xmath93 .",
    "this step is not crucial to the method , but does improve its sensitivity in finding temperature fluctuations imposed in the mock spectra .",
    "\\(3 ) observed spectra contain metal lines in addition to lines .",
    "as described in the data section , we use to fit voigt profiles , @xmath94 , to the spectrum . here",
    ", @xmath95 denotes a voigt profile of species @xmath96 with column density @xmath97 , width @xmath98 and centred on @xmath99 . using this decomposition",
    ", we can reconstruct an ( almost ) metal freespectrum , @xmath100 ( note that we still impose instrumental broadening on this reconstruction . )    the decomposition eq .",
    "( [ eqn : shift ] ) is very good at identifying very narrow lines @xmath101 km s@xmath6 .",
    "when applying the method to data , it is sometimes impossible to decide whether such a narrow line is a metal line or not , because the corresponding other metal transitions may not fall in the observed region of the spectrum , or fall on top of a strong line . in cases where a strong wavelet signal results from a single voigt profile",
    ", we have decided to flag the line as a potential metal line , and not consider it any further in the rest of the analysis .",
    "typically only a hand full of lines ( out of several hundreds ) are removed per spectrum .",
    "this is of course a somewhat subjective procedure , but is unlikely to introduce any _ positive _ detection of a spurious correlation signal .",
    "using @xmath102 instead of the original spectrum @xmath103 has the added benefit that it is also noise free , making it easier to take the derivative ( step 1 ) , and will also be extremely useful in the statistical analysis .",
    "the decomposition in voigt profiles is not unique , but since we only use the reconstructed spectrum , and not the detailed properties of the fitted lines , we expect the spectrum @xmath104 to be nearly independent of the actual manner in which voigt profiles were fitted . in particular , we were unable to detect any systematic differences in line shapes between the original spectrum and the reconstruction , using either our mock spectra or observed data .",
    "we also redid the analysis for one qso spectrum ( qso he  11221648 ) using ( fontana & ballester 1995 ) , another line fitting programme , and found the same results .    in the absence of evolution in the @xmath13 parameters , line widths",
    "@xmath105 will increase with redshift @xmath106 .",
    "this pure expansion   effect can be compensated for by rebinning the spectrum to velocity space , and performs such a rebinning .",
    "\\(4 ) the spectrum also contains strong lines .",
    "their square shape tends to generate large wavelet amplitudes , an effect similar to the gibbs phenomenon familiar from fourier analysis .",
    "in addition , in the saturated region of the strong lines , the wavelet amplitude becomes zero .",
    "these fluctuations in the wavelet amplitudes do not contain any information on the igm temperature and so we ignore them .",
    "we begin by identifying all regions of the spectrum within 1 per cent of being black .",
    "all pixels within 1.5 times the wavelet - width of such a region are ignored in the statistical analysis described in the next section .    in summary",
    ": we start by fitting the original spectrum @xmath81 with voigt profiles , and reconstruct the spectrum from the fit , using only those lines not identified as ( or suspected to be ) metal lines . for this spectrum , @xmath107 , we compute the wavelet projection of its normalised derivative , @xmath108 to quantify temperature variations along the spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] illustrates the procedure .",
    "it shows two stretches taken from spectrum s1 of length 5000 km s@xmath6 , corresponding to model c and the 50 per cent hotter model h , respectively .",
    "the wavelet amplitudes tend to be significantly larger in the spectrum taken from the colder model .",
    "the wavelet amplitudes can therefore serve as a thermometer .",

    "so we can now recognise temperature fluctuations by identifying regions over which the wavelet amplitudes are unusually large ( a cold region ) , or unusually small ( a hot region ) .",

    "the quantity @xmath114 can be used as a ( uncalibrated as of yet ) thermometer . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ks_v ] we plot @xmath119 as a function of the starting position @xmath82 of the window for the simulated spectrum s1 .",
    "notice that as long as @xmath82 is in the first half of the spectrum  in which case the window is drawn from the cold simulation c  @xmath120 . there is a sudden transition around @xmath121 km s@xmath6 where @xmath118 jumps to values @xmath122 , as the window starts to fall in the stretch of spectrum drawn from the hotter model h. we want to stress again that , for a given wavelet basis , @xmath123 follows uniquely from projecting the spectrum on a set of basis functions .",
    "our aim is now to use @xmath124 to find regions with different temperatures , and use @xmath125 as a measure of @xmath0 .",
    "however , how can one judge whether a given value of @xmath118 is _ statistically _ significant ?",
    "the usual way ( kolmogorov - smirnov test ) to decide whether two data sets are drawn from the same underlying distribution is to evaluate a particular function of both @xmath126 , and of the effective number of degrees of freedom @xmath127 .",
    "unfortunately , in the present case it is unclear how to determine @xmath127 , since pixels are correlated .",
    "one way to make progress is to use randomised spectra , in which any temperature fluctuations have been destroyed in the randomisation procedure , to _ calibrate _ the distribution of @xmath118 and hence determine how statistically significant the difference seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksdist ] is .",
    "note that , if a randomised spectrum , by chance , produces a a peculiar value of @xmath118 , it is not due to temperature fluctuations , since the temperture - density relation is not different from that of the rest of the spectrum .",
    "the full procedure to assign a statistical significance to unusual regions is described next .",
    "the aim of this procedure is to produce new spectra from the data , in which the absorption lines have the same shapes , but any _ correlation _ between the lines is destroyed .",
    "one could in principle randomise the positions of the voigt profiles in eq .  (",
    "[ eqn : vpfit ] ) , but the resulting spectra turn out to be quite different from the original one .",
    "the reason is that many absorption features are composed of several voigt profiles ( often with large error estimates for the fitted parameters ) , some of which may be quite narrow and are introduced to obtain a good fit . when randomising voigt profiles , such a narrow line will tend to occur on its own , and this causes clear systematic differences between the randomised spectra and the original one .",
    "we have chosen instead to randomise the positions of the absorption features ( absorption lines  as opposed to voigt profiles , in what follows ) themselves .",
    "an absorption line is defined as a stretch of spectrum between two local maxima in @xmath102 .",
    "voigt profiles are now assigned to a line , if the centre of the profile falls between the two maxima that define the line .",
    "randomised spectra are then obtained from randomising the positions of the _ lines _ , making sure that lines do not overlap ( but the voigt profiles may ) , resampling them with replacement . in the tests presented below",
    ", we will show that these randomised spectra are not distinguishable from the original one , in the _ absence _ of imposed temperature fluctuations .",

    ". a higher value of @xmath251 would also allow galaxies to make a significant contribution to the uv - background , as seems to be implied by the measurements of steidel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) of the large escape fraction of uv - photon from lyman - break galaxies ( haehnelt et al .",
    "without such a high @xmath251 , it would be difficult to explain the observed high opacity of the igm .",
    "however , such high values of @xmath251 would appear to violate the tight constraints on @xmath252 determined from the deuterium abundance ( burles & tytler 1998 ; kirkman et al .",
    "2000 ) .    alternatively ,",
    "higher values of @xmath0 can result from other heating mechanisms .",
    "the currently most popular one is that the calculations based on assuming an optically thin gas underestimate the photo - heating rate , by a factor of up to a few ( miralda - escud & rees 1994 ; abel & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , delayed reionization could be responsible for the increase in @xmath0 around @xmath11 , as suggested by schaye et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , ricotti et al . ( 2000 ) and bryan & machacek ( 2000 ) .",
    "in fact , even the constant @xmath0 favoured by mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2001 ) requires an extra heating source , such as reionization .",
    "if the sources responsible for reionizing are bright but scarce , then the temperature distribution could become quite inhomogeneous , with large regions separated from cooler , zones ( miralda - escud & rees 1994 ) .",
    "the ionising radiation would quickly over run the low density voids , impulsively heating the gas , while the more over dense filamentary regions would remain neutral for longer ( miralda - escud , haehnelt & rees 2000 ) . since the lower density gas",
    "then will be hotter , its neutral fraction would become even lower because of the @xmath253 temperature dependence of the recombination coefficient . as a result , the contrast in absorption between voids and filaments would increase even further .",
    "the large jump in @xmath0 of 60 @xmath1 14 per cent over the redshift interval @xmath254 $ ] discussed in section  [ sect : highz ] strongly suggests a sudden entropy injection , likely resulting from reionization .",
    "most of the wavelet signal comes from gas at modest over densities @xmath255 , which produces lines of column density @xmath256 cm@xmath6 .",
    "this is because weaker lines do not contribute significantly to the wavelets , and stronger lines are both fewer , and partly explicitly ignored in the analysis .",
    "this gas traces the modestly over dense filamentary pattern seen in simulations , and our analysis suggests it becomes reionized in in a fraction @xmath258 of a hubble time .",
    "this also naturally explains the relatively high values of @xmath0 found at lower redshifts .",
    "a sudden increase in @xmath0 influences the gas distribution in shallow potential wells .",
    "theuns et al ( 2000 ) explicitly showed how increased heating can drive gas out of the centers of filaments into the lower density surroundings .",
    "the velocity of this gas also contributes to the line widths as determined by voigt - profile fitting . such impulsive heating may influence the formation of halos of virial temperatures @xmath259 k ( gnedin 2000b ) .",
    "after reionization , the igm temperature will fall at a rate @xmath260 , slower than pure adiabatic expansion because of the continuing photo - heating . over a redshift extent @xmath261 of the forest of a qso",
    ", this corresponds to a drop of @xmath262 27 and 32 per cent at redshifts 3 and 2.5 , respectively , between the high and low redshift parts of the qsos spectrum .",
    "this will contribute to making the top half of qso 0014 + 813 unusually hot , and the bottom half of qso 2217 - 2818 unusually cold .",
    "similarly , if reionization were delayed in one region with respect to another , for example as a result of qso clustering , then we might expect to see differences in @xmath0 of order 40 per cent , given our estimate of @xmath263 for the duration of the reionization epoch .",
    "such entropy fluctuations are likely to remain present for a long time afterwards , given that the igm evolves nearly isentropically after reionization .    why do nt we see fluctuations on smaller scales ?",
    "the analysis of spectrum s2 suggests that the present method can detect fluctuations of amplitude 50 per cent in @xmath0 on scales as small as @xmath264 km s@xmath6 .",
    "however , our simulations are clearly somewhat idealised : they lack large scale power , and in addition have an imposed @xmath20 relation _ without any _ scatter . in the real universe",
    ", the presence of large scale power and scatter in the @xmath20 will tend to increase the intrinsic fluctuations in the wavelet amplitudes , making it harder to recognise a stretch of spectrum with truly different @xmath0 or @xmath21 .",
    "this is particularly true around reionization , where small scale fluctuations would be hard to detect in the presence of a large jump in the spectrum as a whole .",
    "however , the absence of small scale fluctuations away from reionization suggests that the igm does obey a reasonably well defined @xmath47 relation on sufficiently large scales @xmath5 km s@xmath6 .",
    "given the arguments above it also suggest that reionization occured relatively well synchronised throughout the igm .",
    "we have presented a method that uses wavelets to characterise objectively the line widths of lines in a qso spectrum .",
    "colder gas produces narrower absorption lines , for which the wavelet amplitudes are larger .",
    "we described a statistical method , based on recognising regions were the distribution of wavelet amplitudes is unusual , to identify regions where the temperature at the mean density , @xmath0 , differs significantly from the mean .",
    "the significance level is determined by performing the wavelet analysis on spectra obtained from the data after scrambling the list of absorption lines , thereby destroying all correlations imprinted by ( temperature ) fluctuations .",
    "we applied this method to mock spectra generated from high resolution hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we imposed several @xmath20 relations on the output from these simulations , and used these to construct spectra with intrinsic temperature fluctuations .",
    "we demonstrated that the method is able to detect fluctuations in @xmath0 of @xmath265 per cent in regions as small as 5000 km s@xmath6 at redshift @xmath26 , at the 95 per cent level .",
    "we also showed that by calibrating the relation between the average wavelet amplitude , @xmath170 , and @xmath0 using our hydrodynamical simulations , one can estimate the igm temperature with an rms error of order of 30 per cent , per stretch of spectrum of 5000 km s@xmath6 .",
    "we have applied the method to eleven high resolution qso spectra .",
    "there is strong evidence of a sharp _ increase _ in @xmath0 by a factor @xmath266 14 per cent over the redshift interval @xmath254 $ ] .",
    "we interpreted this as evidence for reionization , and concluded that it took of order @xmath267 to reionize the filaments at overdensity @xmath55 that our method is most sensitive to .",
    "our estimate for the temperatures above and below the jump are @xmath268k and @xmath220 , respectively .",
    "these values are in excellent agreement with those obtained by schaye et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who used a very different method .    at lower redshifts , we find that the igm appears to follow a reasonably well defined @xmath47 relation on scales larger than 5000 km s@xmath6 . in 8 qso spectra , we only found two unusual regions , significant at the more than 99 per cent level .",
    "qso 0014 + 813 has a hot region of size @xmath269 km s@xmath6 at @xmath4 , where the temperature is around 60@xmath1 30 per cent higher .",
    "this could be a relic of reionization , enhanced by the over all descrease in @xmath0 along the spectrum as a result of adiabatic expansion .",
    "qso 22172818 has a cold region of similar size , at @xmath270 , where @xmath0 is lower by @xmath271 36 per cent . again in addition to adiabatic expansion , the three voids in this spectrum will contribute to making this region unusual .",
