    "one classy region , the serpens south cloud , has received considerable attention since its recent discovery with _ spitzer _ ( gutermuth et al .",
    "2008 ) because of its remarkable filamentary structure ( see figure [ serps ] ) , as well as its extreme youth and high protostellar density .",
    "multi - wavelength observations indicate there are about 160 dust continuum sources at different evolutionary stages ( maury et al .",
    "the high count of protostars compared to class ii ysos indicates this cluster is very young ( a few @xmath6  yr ) and active . because of its youth , the star formation activity has not had much time to impact the natal cloud structure .",

    "however , the angular resolution of all these observations is coarser than @xmath7 while the new classy data is @xmath8 .",
    "the serpens south molecular cloud was observed in a campaign between august 2012 and august 2013 with the carma 23-element mode in the two most compact configurations , e and d , covering an area of 250  square arcminutes .",

    "details on observations and processing of classy data are provided in storm et al .",
    "the large - scale structure of the serpens south molecular cloud is defined by parsec - scale filamentary structures around a central hub where a dense cluster of protostars lies .",

    "the figure shows that the n@xmath0h@xmath1emission generally follows the dust emission detected with _",
    "herschel _ in the submillimeter , tracing the cold and dense gas in elongated structures commonly seen as filaments , and identified in this case by visually inspecting the n@xmath0h@xmath1integrated intensity map .",
    "the most prominent filament runs southeast of the hub ( which we label fse ) ; there are also filaments due east ( fe ) and southwest ( fsw ) ( figure [ serps ] ) . north of the hub , the high - resolution classy n@xmath0h@xmath1observations clearly separate the main dusty filamentary structure into at least two separate filaments not resolved in the _ herschel _ images : filaments fne and fnw ( figure [ serps ] ) .",
    "although most of the filaments are seen in both n@xmath0h@xmath1and dust emission , there are a few filaments only detected in dust ( e.g. , southwest or northeast structures on the map ) .",
    "we speculate that this can be due to the lower density of these filaments and/or a decrease in the n@xmath0h@xmath1abundance due to the reaction with increased co abundances in regions of lower density and/or higher temperature ( e.g. , bergin et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "analysis of the n@xmath0h@xmath1classy data provides a detailed view of the morphology and kinematics of these filaments . in this letter",
    "we focus on three filaments ( fe , fse and fnw , figure [ serps ] ) .",
    "the n@xmath0h@xmath1filaments are seen as elongated structures , with slightly curved morphologies ( figure [ moms]a ) .",
    "the n@xmath0h@xmath1filament length is similar to that of its associated dusty filament , but its path is often separated by lower intensity emission .",

    "a similar analysis for the fn filament ( not shown ) also shows that the gas filament width is about one - half of the dusty filament width .",
    "_ herschel _ observations of molecular cloud filaments find that the filament width distribution , for a sample of 278 filaments in different molecular clouds with varying distances , has a strong peak at @xmath13  pc ( arzoumanian et al .  2011 ; andr et al .",
    "andr et al .",
    "conclude that this characteristic width is a quasi - universal  value , which implies that @xmath14  pc must be an intrinsic scale of the filament formation process .",
    "figure [ intcuts]a shows how the n@xmath0h@xmath1filament profile convolved ( violet dashed line ) with the 350  @xmath10 m _ herschel _ beam matches quite well the dust profile ( black line ) , while the @xmath8 classy profile ( green curve ) shows a prominent centrally peaked filament .",
    "why is the n@xmath0h@xmath1emission more peaked than the dust continuum ?",
    "there are key differences in how the dust continuum and n@xmath0h@xmath1emission trace the material in filaments .",
    "the dust continuum emission at 300 - 500  @xmath10 m increases with increasing temperature and column density , with no dependence on density .",
    "the n@xmath0h@xmath1emission depends on density , n@xmath0h@xmath1column density , and gas temperature through the line excitation and opacity . using the radex program ( van der tak et al .",
    "2007 ) to calculate lvg models with t@xmath15  k , we found that the n@xmath0h@xmath1@xmath2 emission is a fairly linear function of n@xmath0h@xmath1column density for densities of 10@xmath16 to 10@xmath17  @xmath18 .",
    "below density 10@xmath16  @xmath18 , the n@xmath0h@xmath1column density needs to increase rapidly with decreasing density to emit a fixed line temperature .",
    "this means that the emission efficiency of the gas per unit path length decreases rapidly . in the context of a filament with fixed diameter",
    ", the observable emission will decrease unless the n@xmath0h@xmath1fractional abundance increases rapidly .",
    "the chemistry of n@xmath0h@xmath1favors a drop in n@xmath0h@xmath1abundance with decreasing density ( bergin et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) , which translates into a line emission drop .",
    "co destroys n@xmath0h@xmath1 , so in regions less dense than the co depletion threshold ( 2 - 6@xmath19  @xmath18 , e.g. , tafalla et al .",
    "2002 ) , the abundance of n@xmath0h@xmath1decreases . for estimated n@xmath0h@xmath1abundances of 3 - 8@xmath20 ( e.g. , shirley et al .",
    "2005 ) , and a filament path length of 0.03  pc , gas at a density of 10@xmath16 @xmath18 produces n@xmath0h@xmath1@xmath2 lines of 1.5 - 4 k ( at the observed fwhm of 0.35  km  s@xmath3 ) , comparable to the strongest observed lines . hence the observations are consistent with the n@xmath0h@xmath1emission accentuated by the increase in density and abundance . the n@xmath0h@xmath1emission is therefore found as filamentary structures that are narrower than the dust filaments .",
    "two alternatives are suggested .",
    "first , it could be that herschel resolution is not enough to resolve the substructure inside filaments .",
    "second , it could be that real filaments are broader than observed in n@xmath0h@xmath1 , but density , temperature and abundance effects contribute to the different width measurements .",
    "the above discussion relates to dust filaments composed of single n@xmath0h@xmath1filaments ; there are other broad dust filaments composed of several narrower n@xmath0h@xmath1filaments .",
    "for example , the fse filament is composed of three n@xmath0h@xmath1filaments in the southern part that are positioned quasi - parallel to each other and extend over the entire width of the dusty filament ( see figure [ moms ] and figure [ intcuts]b ) .",
    "a similar morphology is seen in the fe filament , which runs parallel to two shorter n@xmath0h@xmath1filaments south of it .",
    "this is analogous to the bundles found by hacar et al .",
    "( 2013 ) within filaments in a region of the taurus molecular cloud , which were only resolved in radial velocity ( they lacked the resolution to spatially resolve them ) .",
    "the structures presented here are spatially resolved and their paths clearly distinguished and , unlike the bundles found by hacar et al .",
    ", most of the quasi - parallel n@xmath0h@xmath1filaments within a dust filament have similar radial velocities .",
    "these results indicate that the dust filaments observed by _",
    "herschel _ do not always represent one uniform structure within physical filaments , but perhaps are related filaments along the line of sight that project into the appearance of a single filament . a more robust intensity profile analysis along with further high angular resolution line and continuum observations of more dust filaments in other regions",
    "are needed in order to determine if filaments have a common width and the frequency of subfilaments within filaments .",
    "the classy n@xmath0h@xmath1data also probe the gas kinematics , therefore adding a dynamical perspective to the analysis of these structures .",
    "an analysis of the line - of - sight velocity centroid map reveals that the filaments present smooth line - of - sight velocity variations .",
    "some filaments display slight velocity gradients along their length ( e.g. , fse and fe ; figure [ serps ] ) while others do not ( e.g. , fnw ) .",
    "the strength of the observed gradients ( @xmath21  km  s@xmath3  pc@xmath3 ) , corresponds to a crossing time of about a million of years .",
    "line - of - sight velocity gradients along molecular cloud filaments have been identified in serpens south and in other regions as well ( e.g. , peretto et al .",
    "for example , kirk et al .",
    "( 2013 ) also detected a velocity gradient in fse ( 0.9  km  s@xmath3  pc@xmath3 assuming @xmath22  pc ) , which is consistent with our measured fse gradient of 0.8  km  s@xmath3  pc@xmath3 . in many cases ,",
    "these gradients have been interpreted as evidence of material flowing inside the filaments , infalling toward the hubs or filamentary junctions ",
    "regions of active star formation .",
    "the typical velocity gradient ranges between 0.2 - 2  km  s@xmath3  pc@xmath3 , coinciding with our estimate of the gradients along the fse and fe filaments in serpens south .",
    "although the observed velocities are consistent with those expected from gravitational infall , given the current data this is not the only possible ( nor necessarily the preferred ) explanation for the observed gradients .",
    "most importantly , not all filaments in serpens south show gradients along their length ( see for instance the fnw filament in figure [ serps ] ) , contrary to what is expected if the gravitational pull from the relatively massive hub is the main cause for the gradient .",
    "moreover , even filaments with gradients do not show the symmetrical high velocity infall signature ( e.g. , filament a of figure 2 in moeckel & burcket  2014 ) . a simple alternative for a gradient in radial velocity along",
    "a filament s length is that it is the mere projection effect in an elongated structure , perhaps originating from cloud - scale gas turbulence ( n. moeckel private communication ) . in this scenario",
    ", parsec - scale turbulent eddies of gas can produce smooth radial velocity gradients in structures with sizes comparable to the eddies .",
    "another possibility is that the velocity variations in the filaments are due to the convergence of two or more flows ( csengeri et al .",
    "2011 ) , and even more sophisticated alternative can include oscillations inside the filament of the material produced by over - densities or starless cores within them ( hacar et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "while some velocity gradients are parallel to the main length of the filament , the classy n@xmath0h@xmath1data also show the existence of velocity gradients perpendicular to several filaments .",
    "these gradients are , in several cases , detected along the entirety of the filament .",
    "the velocity centroid map of the fnw and fe filaments display these gradients ( figure [ serps ] and figure [ moms]b ) .",
    "figure [ gradfe ] shows both the gradient perpendicular to the fe filament ( 11.9  km  s@xmath3  pc@xmath3 ) and the gradient along the filament ( 0.9  km  s@xmath3  pc@xmath3 ) .",
    "remarkably , one gradient is an order of magnitude larger than the other , indicating that the gas crossing time across the filament is ten times shorter than along the filament ( note that gas crossing time is estimated as the time that takes a given gas parcel to travel along or across the filament ) ; this suggests the more dynamical nature of the velocity gradient across ( perpendicular to ) the filament than the one along ( parallel to ) the filament .    to better understand perpendicular line - of - sight velocity gradients in a handful of filaments in serpens south and other clouds as well ,",
    "the data are being analyzed and compared against numerical simulations of filament formation via self - gravity in gas that has already been compressed into a locally planar structure by supersonic converging flows ( e.g. gong & ostriker 2011 , che - yu & ostriker  2014 ) ; the results will be published elsewhere ( mundy et al . in prep . ) . in these simulations ,",
    "the velocity gradients are the result of the in - plane motions associated with forming and growing the filament .",
    "gradients across filaments have already been observed in the dr21 filament ( schneider et al .",
    "2010 ) , but in that case , the filament width is about 1  pc , which is more than a factor of 10 wider than the filaments we are analyzing in serpens south .",
    "therefore , the nature of the gradients across the serpens south fe and fnw filaments is likely different from those found in dr21 .",
    "more generally , gradients across filaments can be thought of as projection effects of kinematics ( due to turbulence , self - gravity or other forces ; schneider et al .",
    "2010 ; che - yu & ostriker 2014 ) within a flat structure inclined with respect to the plane of the sky ( but see li & goldsmith 2012 ) .",
    "an alternative explanation is that two or more narrower filaments with slightly different radial velocities partially overlap on the plane of the sky forming the perpendicular velocity gradient . in any case , these perpendicular gradients are not consistent with the picture in which gradients in filaments trace the flow of material along filaments toward the hub , as the local dynamical evolution will occur on a much faster time than the inward flow timescale .",
    "we have reported new carma n@xmath0h@xmath1(@xmath2 ) observations from the classy project toward the serpens south molecular cloud , covering a region of 3.6  pc@xmath23 at a spatial resolution of 7@xmath4 and a velocity resolution of 0.16  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the data impose new observational constraints to the origin and evolution of molecular cloud filaments :    * n@xmath0h@xmath1filament widths are two to three times narrower than the widths obtained from _ herschel _",
    "data for the same filaments .",
    "we show that this could arise from the density and chemical selectivity of the n@xmath0h@xmath1emission but it is also possible that the herschel images are not resolving substructure in the filaments . * in a number of cases in serpens south , single _ herschel _",
    "filaments are composed of two to three narrower n@xmath0h@xmath1filaments , often positioned quasi - parallel .",
    "this is consistent with these filaments being comprised of separate structures in projection and suggests that filaments in star - forming regions are likely more complex than shown by herschel observations .",
    "* line - of - sight velocity gradients along the filament length are not seen in every filament . when observed they are of order @xmath21  km  s@xmath3  pc@xmath3 , consistent with previously detected gradients along filaments in other molecular clouds .",
    "the interpretation of these gradients as flows of gas towards the central cluster of protostars is not unique ; such gradients can also occur in scenarios where filaments are created by large scale turbulence .",
    "* we have observed line - of - sight velocity gradients perpendicular to the fe and fnw filaments .",
    "this is the first time a gradient across a filament is detected in scales of @xmath24  pc .",
    "the gradients across are steeper than the gradients along these filaments and this adds a new constraint to theoretical models explaining the formation of molecular cloud filaments .",
    "these new results are more consistent with a picture where local collapse of filaments is taking place , rather than the scenario where gas flows along filaments feeding material into the central hub .",
