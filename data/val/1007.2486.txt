    "metamaterials have large potential in electromagnetics and optics due to their possibility of tailoring the permittivity and permeability .",
    "this enables construction of , for example , media with negative refractive index @xmath0 @xcite , perfect lenses @xcite , invisibility cloaks @xcite , and other exciting components transforming the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the performance of such devices is strongly limited by losses .",
    "although causality and passivity do not prohibit negative index materials with arbitrary low losses @xcite , in practice it is difficult to fabricate materials with high figure of merit @xmath1 , especially at optical frequencies @xcite . for perfect lenses ,",
    "losses limit the amplification of evanescent waves associated with large spatial frequencies , and therefore the resolution @xcite .",
    "it has therefore been suggested to introduce gain into the metamaterials @xcite .",
    "this could be a promising approach provided the intrinsic losses can be made relatively small so that compensation by a realistic amount of gain is possible .    both permittivity @xmath2 and permeability @xmath3 may involve losses ; thus in general , gain may be needed to reduce _ both _ @xmath4 and @xmath5 . for a perfect lens",
    "it is generally not sufficient e.g. to reduce @xmath4 below zero such that the refractive index @xmath6 becomes real .",
    "however , as long as the object to be imaged is one - dimensional , only one polarization ( te or tm ) of the electromagnetic field is required .",
    "then , provided the lens is sufficiently thin , only one of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 is relevant for the transmission of evanescent waves @xcite . choosing tm polarization , only @xmath2 matters , enabling gain compensation with dielectric , active media .    introducing the necessary active material into a metamaterial leads to a change not only in the imaginary part but also the real part of the permittivity , and",
    "should therefore be kept in mind while designing the metamaterial structure .",
    "other critical considerations include matching of the negative refractive index frequency band to that of the gain lineshape function , the level of loss possible to overcome in the absence of saturation , and the saturation constant of the active medium .",
    "there have been several attempts to create a perfect lens in the near  ir - spectrum the last years @xcite .",
    "the fom currently reported is of the order of 3 for the frequency where @xmath7 @xcite . with these values , traditional optical amplifiers such as erbium - doped silica or gas laser amplifiers will not be able to reduce the intrinsic losses significantly .",
    "theoretical studies have shown that it may be possible to raise the fom at near  ir - frequencies to as much as 20 , while keeping @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it has also been reported that laser dyes , or dye - ag aggregate mixtures , may reach amplifications of up to @xmath9 at near  ir - frequencies @xcite .",
    "taking into account these reports , this article will not speculate further on the choice and design of the metamaterial , but merely assume an appropriate material is physically feasible .",
    "the main purpose of our work is to consider the transmission of evanescent waves in a practical , gain - compensated perfect lens .",
    "clearly , gain saturation is highly relevant in this context , and we demonstrate how this effect leads to limited amplification of evanescent fields , and therefore limited resolution .",
    "we calculate the resolution as a function of the saturation constant of the active medium , and also the detailed field profile and reflections from the lens .",
    "it will become clear that gain saturation is a critical effect which may lead to severe limitations .",
    "the relative permittivity of the active metamaterial is given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the susceptibility of the passive structure , and @xmath12 the contribution from the active part .",
    "the contribution to the susceptibility for travelling and evanescent fields in active media can be modeled using semiclassical theory @xcite .",
    "if there is spherical symmetry , allowing for coupling to several degenerate states with different values of the quantum number @xmath13 , one can show using the wigner - eckart theorem and the general properties of the clebsch - gordan coefficients that the system can effectively be treated as a two - level system . assuming two - level atoms and using the dipole approximation , we find the following expression for the active susceptibility : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the transition frequency , @xmath16 the frequency of the incident light , @xmath17 a phenomenological decay rate due to spontaneous emission and elastic collisions , @xmath18 the complex electric field , and @xmath19 the saturation constant of the active medium .",
    "the saturation constant depends on the selected gain material and pumping level . for dye amplifiers a normal value is @xmath20v@xmath21 m @xcite , corresponding to intensities in the @xmath22 regime for propagating waves .",
    "the numerator in eq . describes the susceptibility in the limit @xmath23 .",
    "the numerator contains the line shape function and several material parameters ; factors that are irrelevant for the analysis below are absorbed into the function @xmath24 . for @xmath25 and @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath24 is simply @xmath26 .",
    "both functions @xmath24 and @xmath19 are real - valued .",
    "note that the material parameters describing the active medium are effective parameters , depending on the geometry of the metamaterial structure , and are not necessarily equal to the bulk parameters of the gain material @xcite .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will consider the frequency @xmath25 .",
    "eq . now reduces to : @xmath27 eq .",
    "describes how the imaginary part of the total permittivity relates to the pumping and local field amplitude .",
    "the real part of the total permittivity is independent of the pumping and the local field .",
    "note that there is a fundamental difference between the nonlinearity due to gain saturation , and conventional second- and third - order nonlinearities .",
    "first , the nonlinearity due to the denominator in eq .",
    "is so large that a taylor expansion up third order is generally not valid .",
    "second , the nonlinearity of a gain medium is expressed in terms of the slowly varying field envelope @xmath28 , while the second- and third order nonlinearities usually are expressed in terms of the rapidly varying time - dependent electric field . since the nonlinearity in our case can be characterized using @xmath28 , the medium will not generate new frequencies for monochromatic input @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , if several modes ( or frequencies ) are present , the modes interact in the sense that the complex refractive index seen by one mode is dependent on the presence and strength of all modes .",
    "we consider a perfect lens slab which extends to infinity in the @xmath29-plane , and has thickness @xmath30 in the @xmath31-direction , see fig .",
    "[ fig : simple ] .",
    "the source is located a distance @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 ) from the input end of the lens .",
    "the incident field from the source will be taken to be a superposition of plane tm - waves , with the magnetic field in the @xmath34-direction . provided @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the spesific value of @xmath3 is not critical for the operation of the lens for evanescent waves @xcite . here",
    "@xmath37 is the vacuum light velocity .",
    "the permittivity is given by eqs .",
    ", , and @xmath38 . the remaining losses after gain compensation ( in the absence of saturation )",
    "is described by the parameter : @xmath39    to find the steady state solution to maxwells equations for our nonlinear medium , an iterative approach can be used . in the zeroth iteration , the electric field",
    "is simply set to zero everywhere .",
    "( alternatively , the initial field could be set to infinity .",
    "this does not give any significant difference in performance , in terms of the required number of iterations . ) in the next iteration , eqs . and are used to find an approximation of the permittivity of the lens . taking the incident magnetic field to be unity ( normalized ) , we can compute the magnetic and electric fields everywhere .",
    "now we may repeat the iteration ; calculate a new approximation of the permittivity from the field , computing the resulting field from this new structure , etc .",
    "the iteration procedure has an inherent stability , as growing fields leads to less gain in the medium , and vice versa .",
    "nevertheless , inaccuracies and even divergence may arise if the number of slices is too low , so that the field no longer can be treated as constant in each slice . in the case",
    "@xmath40 the convergence seems to be particularly sensitive to the number of slices .",
    "an alternative to increasing the number of slices to a very high number , is to regularize the iterative approach as follows : rather than setting the permittivity to that resulting from the field in the previous iteration , it can be set to a weighted mean of the permittivities as resulting from the last two iterations . in our computations ,",
    "the permittivity in iteration @xmath41 ( for @xmath42 ) was set to 0.5 times the permittivity calculated by the field from iteration @xmath43 , pluss 0.5 times that resulting from iteration @xmath44 . for @xmath45",
    "the permittivity was calculated using the field from iteration @xmath46 .",
    "this resulted in convergence after @xmath47 iterations .",
    "the weight factor 0.5 is somewhat arbitrary ; other choices are possible but may require a larger @xmath48 or number of iterations to obtain convergence .",
    "if the root mean square deviation of three successive iterations are within a specified limit ( @xmath49 for the relative permittivity in our computations ) , and strictly decreasing , the results are deemed converge .",
    "note that when the fields of subsequent iterations coincide , we have a valid solution to maxwell s equations with constitute relation as implied by eqs . and .    in general , the fields in one iteration , and therefore the permittivity in the next iteration , will be dependent on @xmath50 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus the computation of the fields in the next iteration requires the solution to maxwell s equations in an inhomogeneous structure .",
    "note that in each iteration , the structure is linear ; the nonlinearity of the structure enters through the iteration .",
    "for the linear calculation , we employ a transfer matrix technique , considering the different plane waves in the structure .",
    "the lens is divided into @xmath48 slices in the @xmath29-plane , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : simple ] .",
    "these slices must be sufficiently thin , such that the permittivity inside each slice is approximately uniform in the @xmath31-direction .",
    "for this condition to be valid for the next iteration as well , the resulting field from the present iteration must also be approximately constant .",
    "this means that @xmath51 for the transverse wavenumbers @xmath52 that contribute significantly to the fields .",
    "the electric field can be found using the ampere ",
    "maxwell s law : @xmath53 with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath50-direction , the magnetic field and the permittivity can be expanded in discrete fourier series @xmath54 for some fourier coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "the new transmission are found by adding colums of @xmath126 . once the total matrix in eq",
    ". has been found , it is straightforward to calculate the unknowns @xmath127 and @xmath128 , and therefore the field amplitudes in all slices .",
    "the thickness @xmath30 of the lens was chosen such that @xmath129 .",
    "the resolution clearly improves with decreasing distance @xmath130 from the lens to the image , since then the required evanescent fields at the end of the lens are reduced",
    ". however there may be practical reasons that makes it impossible to reduce the distances @xmath32 and @xmath130 below a certain value . in our simulations",
    "we have taken @xmath131 .",
    "for simplicity we normalized @xmath132 .",
    "the permeability was set to @xmath133 ; however , since the lens was relatively thin , the specific value of @xmath3 did not matter significantly for evanescent tm waves .",
    "the number of slices were taken to be @xmath134 .",
    "the computation domain @xmath58 was chosen in the range @xmath135 depending on the specific problem , and the number of fourier components ( @xmath13 values ) was of the order of @xmath136 .",
    "first , a single mode source @xmath137 was considered .",
    "the reflection and transmission coefficients , and the fields in the lens , were computed using the iterative method above .",
    "the transmission coefficient is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t ] .",
    "it is easy to see improvements as a result of gain compensation , dependent on the saturation constant @xmath138 .",
    "( here it is useful to recall that for a normalized magnetic field @xmath137 , the electric field is @xmath139\\mathbf{\\hat x } - [ k_x/\\omega_0\\epsilon\\epsilon_0]\\mathbf{\\hat z})\\exp(i k_x x+ i k_z z)$ ] .",
    "thus , for our normalization , we see that @xmath140 , to be compared to @xmath141 . ) nevertheless , for a fixed amplitude of the incident field , fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] indicates that an exponential increase in the saturation constant is needed for a linear increase in the resolution .",
    "this is an important result , as it shows the difficulty of getting large resolution : the required , large evanescent fields associated with large spatial frequencies saturate the gain at the output of the lens .",
    "the reflection coefficient is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : r ] .",
    "we note that significant reflections arise even for the spatial frequencies where the transmission is relatively large . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : efelt ] , the field distributions of the two evanescent components in the lens increase roughly exponentially with @xmath142 or @xmath143 , respectively . for small spatial frequencies , where the lens is essentially perfect , the one increasing in the @xmath142 direction dominates . for higher spatial frequencies the two components have a similar amplitude , such that the total field and therefore the imaginary part of the permittivity start to look like a u - shaped valley .    in general , different plane wave components of the source",
    "will couple to each other through eq . .",
    "to simulate the gain - compensated lens under more real - world conditions , it was therefore tested with several waves traversing the lens simultanously . the transmission of one wave as a function of @xmath52 , in the presence of another wave @xmath144 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t ] .",
    "the amplitudes of both waves were set to @xmath145 to keep the total field at the source equal to the case with a single wave .",
    "moreover , from a number of simulations with several waves , a useful rule of thumb was discovered : as a worst - case estimate , one can judge whether the lens operates as required by assuming that the mode with largest @xmath52 has amplitude equal to the sum of the amplitudes at the source .",
    "more preciesly , suppose a single mode @xmath52 with amplitude @xmath146 experiences a transmission greater than @xmath145 . for any superposition of modes with transversal wavenumbers less than @xmath52 and sum of amplitudes equal to unity , each mode will experience a transmission greater than @xmath145 .    for conventional lenses ,",
    "the rayleigh criterion is usually applied to quantify the distance between two point sources ( or in the one - dimensional case , line sources ) in order to resolve their images .",
    "since our lens is nonlinear , the image of two line sources can not be determined as a superposition of the fields associated with the two sources separately , or as a superposition of the fields associated with their fourier components .",
    "therefore , as in previous literature on perfect lenses , we have chosen to consider a single fourier component source , and defined the spatial resolution as @xmath147 , where @xmath52 is the half maximum wavenumber ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] ) . note that the behavior of the lens for more complex sources can be determined from the rule of thumb described above .",
    "[ fig : slits ] shows the absolute value of the transmitted magnetic field at the image plane , @xmath148 , resulting from a source consisting of two slits .",
    "the image of the slits are clearly better resolved with an increased saturation constant @xmath149 .",
    "we have developed a method for calculating the transmission , reflection , and detailed field profile of a gain - compensated perfect lens , taking into account gain saturation .",
    "the gain compensation clearly improves the resolution limit of perfect lenses .",
    "however , due to gain saturation , a number of nonideal effects arise , included limited resolution and reflections .",
    "the nonideal effects depend heavily on the saturation constant and/or the field strength of the source .",
    "if there are different waves traversing the lens at the same time , they will interact through the material .",
    "waves with a spatial frequency close to the resolution limit will have the greatest impact . as a rule of thumb ,",
    "it is enough to know the sum of amplitudes of the waves at the source , and then assume the mode with the largest spatial frequency has this amplitude . if this single wave is transmitted , in the sense of a transmission larger than @xmath145 , then so will any superposition of waves with less spatial frequencies and the same sum of amplitudes .",
    "the calculations in this work was performed for tm polarization and a one - dimensional source .",
    "for a two - dimensional source with both polarizations , both dielectric and magnetic losses should be compensated , that is , @xmath4 and @xmath5 must be reduced .",
    "although the theory in this paper can trivially be extended to this situation , there may be serious practical problems associated with the fabrication of such active media for optical frequencies .    for a noncompensated lens ,",
    "the maximum spatial frequency resolved by the lens is approximately @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "thus , for a fixed @xmath30 , an exponential decrease in the losses is necessary to increase the resolution linearly . from our numerical results ,",
    "a similar relation is approximately valid for the saturation constant of a gain compensated medium ; to achieve a linear improvement in the resolution , the saturation constant must increase exponentially .",
    "this clearly shows the difficulties of achieving very high resolution .",
