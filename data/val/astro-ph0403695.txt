    "the origin of the large - scale part of observed galactic magnetic fields , of @xmath7 g ( microgauss ) strength and apparently coherent over @xmath8 kpc scales , is unknown",
    ". they could be the consequence of nonlinear amplification of a tiny seed field by galactic dynamo processes .",
    "an alternate possibility is amplification of a weak seed field through anisotropic protogalactic collapse and subsequent further amplification via galactic differential rotation . in both cases a primordial seed field of strength exceeding @xmath9 to @xmath10 g , coherent over @xmath11 mpc scales ,",
    "is apparently needed , and it is often suggested that upto a @xmath11 ng strength seed field might be required .",
    "see kulsrud ( 1999 ) , widrow ( 2002 ) , and giovannini ( 2003 ) for reviews of the state of the art in this area . a primordial magnetic field of present strength @xmath11 ng can leave observable signatures in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy .    in standard cosmologies vorticity perturbations decay and",
    "so do not contribute to cmb temperature or polarization anisotropies .",
    "the presence of a cosmological magnetic field generated during an earlier epoch changes this situation : a primordial magnetic field induces and supports vorticity or alfvn waves ( adams et al .",
    "1996 ; durrer , kahniashvili , & yates 1998 , hereafter dky ) .",
    "these vector perturbations generate cmb anisotropies .",
    "the presence of a preferred direction due to a homogeneous magnetic field background leads to an @xmath12 dependence of @xmath13 , and induces correlations between the @xmath1 and @xmath0 multipole coefficients of the cmb temperature anisotropy field .",
    "since the cmb anisotropies are observed to be random gaussian , it is known that such a contribution can only be subdominant .",
    "we use the observed @xmath14 correlations measured by wmap to place constraints on the strength of a homogeneous primordial magnetic field .",
    "the angular brackets here denote an ensemble average , and the overbar indicates an average over @xmath12 for each @xmath15 . limited by cosmic variance uncertainties",
    ", this would be the useful measure to characterize the signature of a homogeneous primordial magnetic field .",
    "the model on which we base our analysis is introduced in  2 .",
    "our analysis of the wmap data and our results are discussed in  3 .",
    "we conclude in  4 .",
    "we assume that the homogeneous magnetic field @xmath16 is generated prior to the time of recombination .",
    "such a field could be generated during the electroweak phase transition ( see , e.g. , vachaspati 1991 ; sigl , olinto , & jedamzik 1997 ; giovaninni & shaposhnikov 1998 ) , or by an @xmath17-effect dynamo driven by collective neutrino - plasma interactions ( semikoz & sokoloff 2004 ) .",
    "the energy density of this field , @xmath18 , must be small , to prevent a violation of the cosmological principle , and so may be treated as a first order perturbation .",
    "accounting for the high conductivity of the primordial non - relativistic plasma ( with @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the velocity field of the plasma ) , we may use the infinite conductivity , frozen - in condition , @xmath21 .",
    "we also assume that charged particles are tightly coupled to the radiation .",
    "we write @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the first order vector perturbation in the magnetic field ( where @xmath24 ) , and @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the first order vector perturbation in the fluid velocity ( where @xmath27 ) .    as a consequence of magnetic flux conservation",
    "the field lines in an expanding universe are conformally diluted , @xmath28 , and the alfvn velocity in the photon - baryon plasma during the photon dominated epoch when the energy density @xmath29 until recombination , is @xmath30 , and is time independent .",
    "rescaling physical quantities according to the expansion of the universe , the mhd equations result in an equation describing alfvn wave propagation with velocity @xmath31 ( dky ) @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field and an overdot denotes a derivative with respect to conformal time @xmath34 .",
    "choosing only the sine mode , to satisfy the initial condition @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ alfven - eq ] ) we have neglected viscosity so the vorticity solution in eq .",
    "( [ 1alfven - sol ] ) is applicable only on scales bigger than the damping scale .",
    "assuming that the initial vector perturbation is generated by a random process , the two - point correlation function of the vorticity field can be written as ( pogosian et al .",
    "2002 ) @xmath37     \\delta ( { \\bf k } - { \\bf k^\\prime } ) .",
    "\\label{two - point}\\ ] ] here @xmath38 is the totally antisymmetric tensor , and the @xmath39 and @xmath40 power spectra describe the symmetric and helical parts of the two - point correlation function .",
    "we assume that the spectra @xmath39 @xmath41 and @xmath40 are given by simple power laws of the scale @xmath42 on scales larger than the perturbation damping scale @xmath43 , i.e. , for @xmath44 we take @xmath45 and @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 are dimensionless normalization constants with @xmath49 , and @xmath50 and @xmath12 are spectral indexes .",
    "the cutoff scale @xmath43 is the scale below which the magnetic field is damped away , due to the non - infinite value of the conductivity .",
    "using @xmath51 and @xmath52 cm , the comoving magnetic field damping wave number at decoupling is @xmath53 ( dky ) .",
    "the cmb fractional temperature anisotropy , in direction @xmath54 on the sky , induced by a vorticity perturbation ( ignoring a possible dipole contribution from the vector perturbation ) is ( dky ) @xmath55 decomposing the cmb fractional temperature anisotropy in a spherical harmonic expansion , @xmath56 and using the definition of the power spectrum @xmath57 , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the legendre polynomial , we obtain , in the isotropic case , @xmath60 . here",
    "the angular brackets denote a theoretical ( averaging ) expectation value over an ensemble of statistically identical universes . in fourier space",
    "this expectation value can be replaced by integration over all possible wavenumbers , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "computing @xmath62 , it can be shown that the helical part of vorticity does not contribute ( see pogosian et al .",
    "hence in what follows we consider only the symmetric part of the spectrum .",
    "detailed computation of @xmath57 s for vorticity perturbations are described in dky where it has been shown that the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field induces off - diagonal correlations in multipole space , in particular correlations between @xmath15 and @xmath63 multipole coefficients . to quantify this",
    "we introduce a second power spectrum defined by @xmath64 the two power spectra , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , depend on the spectral index @xmath50 , the normalization constant @xmath47 , the alfvn velocity @xmath67 and the perturbation damping wavenumber @xmath68 .",
    "the power spectra are defined only for @xmath69 ( the quadrupole diverges at small @xmath70 for @xmath71 ) , and for @xmath72 the results are determined by the damping wavenumber @xmath68 .",
    "the case @xmath73 corresponds to the harrison - peebles - yu - zeldovich scale - invariant spectrum ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "see dky for a more detailed discussion .",
    "the non - zero correlation of temperature for unequal @xmath15 s has a simple physical explanation : the presence of a preferred spatial direction , that of the magnetic field @xmath75 , breaks the spatial isotropy of the cmb map , leading not only to an @xmath12 dependence of the correlators , but also non - zero off - diagonal ( in @xmath15 space ) correlations .",
    "the temperature perturbation correlation between two points on the sky depends not only on the angular separation between the two points , but also on their orientation with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "using @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 ( see eq .",
    "this inequality must hold on all scales inside the hubble radius at decoupling , @xmath81 . with the @xmath39 spectrum definition in eq .",
    "( 3 ) we therefore get @xmath82 for @xmath83 , implying @xmath84 so for @xmath85 the result is independent of the damping wavenumber @xmath68 .",
    "we now estimate an upper limiting value of @xmath15 , @xmath86 , beyond which our approximation is no longer valid . just like scalar perturbations ( peebles 1980 ) ,",
    "vector perturbations are affected by collisionless damping .",
    "adding a photon drag force term on the right hand side of the vorticity equation ( [ alfven - eq ] ) , we can see that there are no oscillations in the vector perturbation case , and that damping occurs on scales slightly larger than the damping scale for scalar perturbations , when @xmath87 ( dky ) , corresponding to @xmath88 , beyond which our approximation breaks down .    inserting the limiting values given for @xmath47 in eqs .",
    "( [ lim1 ] ) and ( [ lim2 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ cbar ] ) , we find + for @xmath73 , @xmath89 and , for @xmath90 , @xmath91 in this paper , we use @xmath4 and @xmath6 as two illustrative cases .",
    "these two cases are interesting as they correspond to a harrison - peebles - yu - zeldovich scale - invariant spectrum result for the @xmath57 s and @xmath76 s , and to a possible inflation model primordial vorticity field perturbation spectrum , respectively .",
    "these two cases also span the range of constraints that can be placed on @xmath92 using this method , in the range @xmath93 , i.e. , @xmath4 gives the weakest and @xmath6 the strongest constraint on @xmath92 . with @xmath94 , from eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 11 ) @xmath92 is not meaningfully constrained for @xmath95 .",
    "we use the foreground cleaned q , v , and , w band co - added wmap data ( bennett et al .",
    "2003a ) to determine the off - diagonal correlations .",
    "the data are available in the healpix format ( gorski , hivon , & wandelt 1998b ) at resolution @xmath96 . for each value of the magnetic field amplitude @xmath92",
    "we generate 5000 simulations of the cmb sky , and each time apply the @xmath97 galactic cut mask prior to computing the model @xmath76 s .",
    "the expected value of the model @xmath76 s , obtained from the mean of these simulations , is then compared with the @xmath76 s obtained similarly from the wmap data , using the @xmath98 statistic .",
    "confidence levels on the field strength are derived from the resulting likelihood function .",
    "specifically , each simulation is a realization of the cmb with power spectrum @xmath57 given by the best fit flat-@xmath99 cdm model with power - law primordial power spectrum ( spergel et al .  2003 ) , and with @xmath76 the same as that predicted by eq .",
    "( 10 ) ( or more specifically eqs .  [ 14 ] or [ 15 ] ) for a given value of @xmath92 .",
    "in other words , we generate @xmath100 s such that they satisfy @xmath101,\\ ] ] instead of @xmath102    the @xmath100 s are generated upto an @xmath103 of 512 ( corresponding to healpix resolution @xmath104 ; since the wmap data are expected to contain useful cosmological information upto such an @xmath103 ) .",
    "these are then convolved with the beam functions of each of the q , v , and w radiometer channels ( 8 in all ) to produce 8 maps at healpix resolution @xmath96 ( because the noise maps have this resolution ) .",
    "independent gaussian noise realizations of rms @xmath105 from wmap are added to the maps , and the 8 maps are co - added weighted by @xmath106 , where the effective number of observations @xmath107 varies across the sky , and @xmath108 is different for each radiometer channel .",
    "this is how each simulation is created .",
    "hereafter the same analysis procedure that is applied to the data map is applied to each of the simulations .",
    "this consists of bringing the co - added map down to healpix resolution @xmath104 ( since we mostly use @xmath76 s only upto an @xmath103 of 300 in the subsequent analysis ) , and applying the @xmath97 sky cut prior to computing the @xmath76 s .",
    "the whole analysis can be repeated for different values of the spectral index @xmath50 that characterizes the spectrum of the magnetic field perturbations .",
    "1 shows the @xmath76 s obtained from the wmap data ( crosses ) and the median and 68% confidence range contours from simulations for two illustrative values of @xmath92 .",
    "the spread of about @xmath109 mk@xmath110 in the 68% confidence contours for @xmath111 is consistent with what is expected from cosmic variance alone .    to compare the likelihoods for different @xmath92 values",
    ", we use the diagonal @xmath98 statistic @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the wmap data value , and @xmath114 the average and @xmath115 the standard deviation of the @xmath116 , both obtained from 5000 model simulations , for each value of @xmath92 . note that we do not use the full covariance matrix for the @xmath76 s but rather just the diagonal terms .",
    "this is because 5000 simulations are not sufficient to produce a reliably converged full covariance matrix for the @xmath76 s . as also noted by eriksen et al .",
    "( 2004b ) , for example , even the above @xmath98 test can provide a just comparison between data and simulations .",
    "the likelihood is proportional to @xmath117 .",
    "we calculate the likelihood for a few different values of @xmath92 .    the likelihood function obtained for the @xmath4 case",
    "is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "after integration , we get a 3 @xmath2 confidence upper limit of @xmath3 ng . as we can see from fig .  2 ,",
    "@xmath92=0 g , which corresponds to pure gaussian primordial fluctuations , is within the 1 @xmath2 confidence range from the peak of the likelihood function ( this 1 @xmath2 range corresponds to a @xmath118 of 3.9 ng ) .",
    "the jaggedness in the likelihood function is from the fluctuation of mean @xmath76 s used in calculating @xmath98 ( see fig .  1 ) . with 5000 simulations ,",
    "the fluctuation of mean @xmath76 s should be of the order of @xmath119 .",
    "this results in a fluctuation of 0.1 in the @xmath98 values , or a 5% uncertainty in the estimated likelihood .",
    "this does not much affect the results of our analysis ( for example for the 3 @xmath2 limit on @xmath92 we look for a @xmath120 of 9 , which is not very sensitive to a 5% uncertainty in the estimated likelihoods ) .    for the @xmath90 case ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , the 3 @xmath2 confidence limit is @xmath121 ng , and again the pure gaussian primordial fluctuation case with @xmath122 g is not far from the 1 @xmath2 confidence range from the peak . in this case 1",
    "@xmath2 corresponds to a @xmath123 ng .",
    "more stringent limits are obtained in this case as expected ( eq . [ 15 ] shows that larger @xmath76 s with a stronger @xmath15-dependence are predicted by the model for @xmath6 ) .",
    "the conditions of homogeneity and unidirectionality of the primordial magnetic field may be a better approximation on some scales rather than others .",
    "in each of the above cases for @xmath50 , other ranges in @xmath15 , such as @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , or @xmath127 , did not indicate anything qualitatively different , i.e. , @xmath128 g remains a satisfactory fit .",
    "we study off - diagonal correlations of the form @xmath129 in the first year wmap cmb anisotropy data .",
    "such correlations can result from a homogeneous primordial magnetic field .",
    "we do not find significant off - diagonal correlations in the data , which appear to be satisfactorily fit by a zero primordial magnetic field hypothesis .",
    "we place 3 @xmath2 upper limits on the strength of the magnetic field of @xmath3 ng for spectral index @xmath4 and @xmath5 ng for @xmath6 .",
    "these two cases are interesting as they correspond to a harrison - peebles - yu - zeldovich scale - invariant spectrum result for the @xmath57 s and @xmath76 s , and to a possible inflation model primordial magnetic field perturbation spectrum , respectively .",
