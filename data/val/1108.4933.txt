    "the penetration depth and its temperature dependence are important characteristics of any superconductor and are considered key to determining the momentum space structure of the order parameter .",
    "@xcite the possibility of disorder in exotic superconductors is well known , but analyses performed to date have concentrated on the effect of disorder - induced scattering on the momentum space structure of the gap .",
    "@xcite this paper is motivated by the possibility that disorder may lead to nanoscale real space variation and the associated need to model the relationship between such spatial variation and properties that are measured on longer length scales .",
    "we address how inhomogeneity in the penetration depth may affect bulk measurements of the penetration depth for methods that rely on meissner screening and can be analyzed by solutions to london s equation .",
    "in particular , we show that the measured result is not simply given by the average value of the penetration depth , but is affected by the statistical structure of the spatial variations in the penetration depth .",
    "many superconductors are created by chemical doping of a non - superconducting parent compound . in these systems",
    "the inherent randomness of the doping process may give rise to an inhomogeneous superconducting state .",
    "the importance of this effect will be determined by the characteristic length over which the dopant atoms affect the superconductivity . even in the most ordered material",
    ", there will be binomial fluctuations in the total number of dopants in a given region .",
    "in general , one does not expect significant spatial variation in materials that are weakly correlated and can be described by a rigid band model .",
    "for example , disorder is largely irrelevant in classic metallic superconductors , due to their long coherence lengths and weakly correlated nature.@xcite in contrast , the cuprates are doped insulators with a coherence length on the scale of the lattice .",
    "they are known to have nanoscale disorder in their superconducting properties , as seen by scanning tunneling microscopy.@xcite similar gap maps have been observed in the iron pnictide family @xcite and in disordered titanium nitride films close to the superconductor to insulator transition .",
    "@xcite    materials with intrinsic disorder present two separate challenges . understanding how the random doping process gives rise to local superconducting properties , such as the penetration depth or local density of states , requires a microscopic model . but",
    "even with such a model , we still need to make the connection between the local superconducting properties and bulk measurements .",
    "the manner in which local superconducting properties relate to the observed properties will differ from experiment to experiment .",
    "for instance , a measurement of the heat capacity will return the total heat capacity of the macroscopic sample , so the inferred specific heat capacity will be a volume average over the sample .",
    "in contrast , we might expect the thermal conductivity response to be dominated by a percolation path connecting regions with small local gap , @xmath1 , or large local density of states .    here",
    "we focus on the penetration depth , @xmath2 , as measured by screening of the magnetic field , including both resonant cavity frequency shift measurements at radio frequencies@xcite and the local probes of magnetic force microscopy@xcite and scanning squid susceptometry.@xcite these methods measure @xmath3 by detecting the response magnetic field generated by the superconductor due to an applied field , and can be analyzed using the london equation .",
    "thus , we can model the effect of inhomogeneity by solving the london equation with @xmath0 as a random function of position @xmath4 .",
    "our goal is to find a new equation for the disorder - averaged magnetic field , as this will determine the measured response .",
    "here , we work in the limit of small fluctuations to find an approximate equation for the disorder - averaged magnetic field , as this will determine the measured response .",
    "to understand the measured penetration depth when @xmath0 is a random function of position , we calculate the disorder - averaged magnetic field response to obtain an effective penetration depth . for isotropic and local superconductors in three dimensions ,",

    "[ london_parts ] .",
    "our method of solution comes from the similarity of the helmholtz and london equations .",

    "thus our problem is related to the propagation of waves in a random medium , and we can build upon a large and multidisciplinary literature devoted to this challenge.@xcite the paper by karal and keller @xcite is particularly relevant , because it retains the vectorial nature of the problem , rather than simplifying to a scalar wave equation .",

    "how significant is the effect of disorder - induced change in the penetration depth , given that @xmath118 approaches 1 over a large segment of the @xmath103-@xmath76 plane ?",
    "modern measurements can routinely resolve sub - nanometer changes in the penetration depth ; @xcite in cuprates and pnictides the penetration depth is approximately 200 nm , and a 1-nm change in @xmath2 yields @xmath119 of 0.5%  making even small changes in @xmath118 potentially significant .",
    "two issues are worth emphasizing .",
    "first , we have made no assumption about the distribution of @xmath0 , i.e. , whether it is normally distributed or follows a different probability distribution .",
    "however , the calculation presented here only extends to second order , and any non - normality only enters at third order and above .",
    "second , @xmath68  has a complicated dependence on the correlation function @xmath51 , and we know neither its functional form nor its temperature dependence .",
    "hence we can not make any tidy prediction for the low - temperature behavior of @xmath3 ; there is no power - law to be had .    even without perfect knowledge of @xmath51 , it may be possible learn more about @xmath68  by taking advantage of the general constraints that apply to all correlation functions .",
    "@xcite in particular , the strong similarities between the two cases presented here ( figs .",
    "[ lambdaeff ] and [ lambdamatern ] ) lead us to expect qualitatively similar behavior in @xmath68  for most possible correlation functions .    to make a stronger statement about @xmath3",
    ", we need to determine the local superconducting properties of a given chemically doped and intrinsically disordered material , which naturally depends on the microscopic details of the superconducting mechanism .",
    "although it should be possible to extract a local penetration depth or superfluid density from numerical methods such as solving the bogoliubov  -  de gennes equations on a lattice , to the best of our knowledge this has never been attempted .",
    "several groups have calculated the _ disorder - averaged _ superfluid stiffness using this approach , for both s - wave@xcite and d - wave@xcite models .",
    "the full temperature dependence of the disorder - averaged superfluid density can also be calculated,@xcite but is incomplete , for we have shown that the real space inhomogeneity of the superconducting state also contributes to the temperature dependence .",
    "the larger message is that some measured properties of disordered superconductors will not be determined by their disorder averages alone ; inhomogeneities can affect the measured properties in an experiment - dependent manner .",
    "for example , the heat capacity will be given by the disorder average because it is additive , but we have seen that the penetration depth is non - trivially affected by the disorder . nonetheless , these two experiments are both traditionally interpreted as measuring the same thing  the magnitude of the single - particle gap , @xmath117 .",
    "these results give a specific example of the potential impact of spatial variation on measurements of the penetration depth . with a full consideration of the impact of spatial variation on different measured quantities , as well as a complete understanding of",
    "how random chemical doping gives rise to a non - uniform superconducting state , we will be able to integrate a complete account of the effects of disorder into our understanding of unconventional superconductivity .",
    "we thank john kirtley , steve kivelson , jim sethna , and jrg schmalian for helpful discussions .",
    "we would also like to thank john kirtley for checking some of these calculations .",
