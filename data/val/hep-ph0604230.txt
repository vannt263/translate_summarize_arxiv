    "historically there has always been feedback and interplay between the hadronic and the leptonic colliders .",
    "@xmath0 saw a handful of @xmath1s and @xmath2s , establishing the correctness of the @xmath3 model , whereas the lep / slc tested it to a one per mil precision using the millions of @xmath2s and thousands of @xmath4 .",
    "the agreement between the ` prediction ' of the top mass obtained using precision measurements from lep and the ` direct ' measurements made at the tevatron , was indeed a very important step in establishing the standard model .",
    "but since this synergy has always existed , one may well ask the question as to what is the special need now for discussing the lhc / ilc synergy .",
    "the need arises from the current state of play in high energy physics ( hep ) and the high stakes in physics studies at future colliders , both on the physics front and on the economic front ; as well as the long time scales which the planning and execution for a new collider require .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    the lhc is a hadronic collider with pp collisions at @xmath5 tev , whose strong point is the larger mass reach for direct discoveries .",
    "even though at the lhc the composite nature of colliding protons gives rise to an underlying event and the @xmath6 of the hard interaction is not fixed , one can use conservation of the transverse momentum @xmath7 and thus study interesting hard physics .",
    "being a hadronic machine all the physics studies at the lhc will have to deal with large qcd backgrounds .",
    "the ilc on the other hand is planned to be an @xmath8 collider with @xmath9 ",
    "@xmath10 tev .",
    "its strong point being the high precision physics .",
    "the precisely known initial state kinematics along with possibilities of the initial state beam polarisation , allows accurate and detailed analysis of the decays , precision determinations of masses and couplings etc .",
    "since the initial state contains ew particles the qcd backgrounds will be smaller than at the lhc .",
    "further , it will also offer possibilities of various options ; such as the @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , opening up chance to study aspects of physics of the sm as well as physics beyond the sm , that may not accessible at the lhc or in the @xmath8 option of the ilc .",
    "the lhc , however , has the greatest advantage of all , viz .",
    ", it is all geared to start action in 2007 , whereas we still are not sure if , when and where construction will happen for the ilc .",
    "it is heartening however that a clear international consensus has emerged on the ilc now and the planning is in full swing .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the expected cross - sections at the lhc and the ilc for different processes .",
    "the plots in left panel show us , for example , that in the exploration of the higgs physics which would be the focus of studies at the lhc , it is going to be a big challenge to deal with the large physics backgrounds . on the other hand",
    "we see from the expected cross - sections at the ilc for the different physics processes , that it is the ilc which will offer the possibility of high precision study of the higgs sector . therefore , as a community it is very important for us to assess the desired energy , luminosity and * the timing * of the ilc vis - a - vis the physics goals of the lhc / ilc which are set by the current stage of understanding in particle physics . in the context of the plc",
    "it really means making sure that the ilc designs keep the possibilities of the plc option open .",
    "till about 2002 or so there was not much interaction between the lhc and the lc community .",
    "lhc / ilc study group was first formed in the context of an ecfa lc group and then became a worldwide affair .",
    "it has been a collaborative effort of the hadron collider ( the lhc ) and the leptonic linear collider ( ilc ) community . at the time of the formation of the group",
    "the lhc was well on its way and the physics case of an ilc had been clearly made .",
    "( incidentally for the plc this exercise needs to be cemented beyond the studies that have already been made  @xcite . )",
    "the aim of the lhc / ilc study group was not to compare which of the two colliders can do better but rather how the two can complement each other and further whether one can identify areas where the cross - talk between the two colliders can increase the utility of _ both_.it is clear that lhc will have higher reach in energy and hence can perhaps create directly new particles expected in the extensions of the sm .",
    "the ilc on the other hand can make precision measurements and can be sensitive to the indirect effects of the same particles even if masses are much higher than the energy of the ilc .",
    "thus information from a lower energy ilc can still feedback into studies at the lhc .",
    "this is the simplest form of synergy between the two colliders .",
    "we have seen an example of this in the comparison between the mass of the top quark as estimated from the precision ew measurements and as measured directly from the tevatron data .",
    "now we see similar interplay for the prediction of the ( sm ) higgs mass , being sharpened by knowledge of the top mass from tevatron .",
    "precision measurements from the ilc may therefore sometimes be able to tell the lhc where to focus the effort .",
    "precision measurements at the lhc are difficult if not impossible , but will be possible only after a few years after the beginning of its operation .",
    "these studies can definitely benefit due to the feedback from the ilc .",
    "of course the ability of the ilc is not restricted to precision measurements alone but also to making possible discoveries which at times will be difficult or impossible at the lhc .",
    "these qualitative statements are almost obvious to practicing phenomenologists and experimentalists , but quantitative studies are necessary .",
    "various examples of such studies and possible cross - talks are present in the document  @xcite .    in the study group report",
    "@xcite possibilities were analysed assuming that the lhc will run for 20 years and that the ilc can kick off after the lhc has been running a few years .",
    "the specific questions that were addressed in this document were as follows :    * how information obtained at both the colliders can be put * together * so that the basic physics questions being asked by the hep community can be answered more * conclusively and effectively*. * can the combined studies give pointers to new bench marks for measurements at the lhc .",
    "* can the results obtained at a lower energy ilc affect the analysis at the lhc if * not * the triggering .",
    "can it affect the luminosity / detector upgrades and also provide yet more focus to the lhc studies .",
    "* what are the physics needs and advantages of concurrent running of the lhc and the ilc .",
    "* what are the physics arguments to make a strong case for keeping the door for plc open in the ilc designs under consideration .",
    "one can think of various possible scenarios for the cross - talk :    * lhc + ilc : ilc data help clear up the underlying structure of new physics of which tevatron and the lhc will give us some glimpses . * : a combined interpretation of lhc / ilc data can help use both the data more effectively to learn about the tev scale physics beyond the sm ; in particular such an analysis can reduce possible model dependencies . * : if the machines have some overlap in time , and a combined analysis of the lhc / ilc data were to be possible then the ilc results could influence the second phase of the lhc , just like some of the lep - ii results have affected the tevatron upgrades .",
    "similarly , the ilc results could provide inputs to the upgrade options for the lhc machines and detectors .",
    "a few comments are in order here : while no examples could be found such that the triggering at the lhc could be affected by what the ilc will see , a very good case could be made for aiming at a combined interpretation of the data and some time overlap so that ilc affect the upgrades at lhc .",
    "many examples for the latter were found particularly in the context of susy studies . in the context of analysis in the higgs sector",
    ", it was shown that a reduction of model dependencies may be achieved through a combined lhc / ilc analysis .",
    "we will look at one example each from the higgs and the susy sector and then go over to the case of a plc",
    ".      the lhc will be able to observe the sm higgs and afford measurements of its various properties such as width , relative couplings to some accuracy ( about 15 - 20% ) by the end of the high luminosity run  @xcite .",
    "as far as the ilc is concerned it can of course profile a higgs most accurately even in the low energy , moderate luminosity option  @xcite , except for the measurement of the @xmath14 coupling and the reconstruction of the higgs potential . at the ilc",
    ", a precision measurement of @xmath14 coupling requires @xmath15 - @xmath16 gev .",
    "the lhc measures @xmath17 b.r . into different channels .",
    "one question that can be asked is whether a cross talk between the lhc and the ilc can improve this situation ?",
    "higgs coupling determination@xcite .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    the strategy is to use the ilc precision information on the other branching ratios of the higgs and thus get information on the @xmath14 coupling in a model independent way , using both the ilc and the lhc data . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the combined use of the lhc and a 500 gev ilc with @xmath18 fb@xmath19 integrated luminosity , will allow a determination of the @xmath14 coupling to an accuracy of @xmath20@xmath21 . further , the accuracy expected taking into account the statistical errors alone is about @xmath22 which is comparable to that expected for a 800 gev ilc with @xmath16 fb @xmath19 .",
    "this clearly shows that the combined analysis of the lhc and the ilc data gives better value for money  @xcite .",
    "next to higgs searches and study of its properties , supersymmetry ( susy ) searches  @xcite will form an important part of the physics program of any collider , be it hadronic , leptonic or photonic .",
    "supersymmetry is certainly broken since we do not see the superpartners of the particles of the sm , differing in spin by @xmath23 from them and with the same mass as them . in the unconstrained minimal supersymmetry standard model , mssm ,",
    "there exist 105 new parameters in the form of the masses of the superpartners and mixing angles . normally while investigating the prospect of susy studies at the lhc , one reduces the number of these parameters by working in the framework of one of the susy breaking models .",
    "these are named after the mechanism used for susy breaking .",
    "these are : a ) gravity mediated ( msugra ) , b ) gauge mediated susy breaking , c ) anomaly mediated susy breaking etc . if tev scale susy should exist then the probability that the lhc will see some signal is very high .",
    "the current studies of the lhc potential in the context of susy not only look at the prospects of discovering it but focus also on the possible measurements of masses and mixing angles . these in turn may be used for susy parameter and consequently the susy breaking mechanism determination .",
    "so far most of the studies of the lhc potential have been model dependent , now they move to * model independent * ones . at the lhc masses will not determined with very high precision but mass differences will be .",
    "in the commonly used @xmath24parity conserving susy scenarios , all the final states corresponding to a decay chain of a given sparticle contains at least one lightest supersymmetry particle ( lsp ) which appears as missing energy .",
    "thus the sparticle mass determined is highly correlated with the mass of the lsp .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the determination of the @xmath25 mass .    ]    the dots in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] indicate the results achievable using the lhc data alone . on the other hand , at the ilc an accurate determination of @xmath26 is possible .",
    "the vertical bands in the fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the results if one were to restrict the @xmath26 to within @xmath27 with the ilc input ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "so the suggested strategy is to use the accurate mass determination of @xmath29 from the ilc and feed it in lhc sparticle mass determination .",
    "the second column in the table 1 shows that indeed the ilc input can reduce the errors in the sparticle mass determination substantially .",
    "these investigations brought out an interesting feature , that the jet measurement seems to be the limiting factor for the accuracies possible with a combined analysis of the lhc and the ilc data .",
    "_ this is an example where the study has isolated a feature of the lhc analysis which , if improved upon , can add to the accuracy of the sparticle mass determination at the lhc in a big way .",
    "_ this thus is a very good example of the lhc - ilc synergy .    .",

    "the availability of polarized photon spectra and a democratic mechanism for production of cp - even and cp - odd higgs , makes the plc an ideal tool to probe cp - violation in the higgs sector .",
    "further , the @xmath31-channel production mechanism allows for single - higgs production and hence increases the reach compared to the @xmath8 option by about a factor of @xmath32 . as a matter of fact , in the mssm for @xmath33 , @xmath34@xmath35 gev",
    ", the lhc will see only one spin 0 state and the @xmath36 are not accessible for the first generation , 500 gev , ilc .",

    "can be used too  @xcite .",
    "the plc also offers a possibility of pinning down the higgs structure of a theory in a general 2 higgd doublet model ( 2hdm ) . some aspects of this have already been discussed elsewhere in the proceedings  @xcite .",
    "krawczyk and collaborators  @xcite have discussed and example where the measurement of @xmath11 width of the higgs is essential to determine whether a higgs seen at the lhc is indeed a sm higgs .",

    "this phase carries information about the couplings of the h to the gauge bosons as well as to a @xmath46 pair .",
    "on the other hand the lhc measurements can give better information on @xmath14 coupling whereas the ilc ones on the @xmath47 couplings . hence combining the information from the plc along with the lhc and the ilc measurements , the couplings of a heavy higgs boson can be pinned down too .",

    "one sees clearly that the @xmath48 measurement possible at the plc will play an absolutely essential role in lifting the sign ambiguity which can not be resolved using the lhc and the ilc . in case of cp - violating 2hdm",
    ", the cp - violating phase will affect the phase of the amplitudes @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which can be measured via interference effects in the angular distributions of the decay @xmath51 s .",
    "the plot in the right panel of fig  [ fig6 ] shows clearly again the crucial role that the plc can play in removing the ambiguities in the determination of the mixing angle in the @xmath52@xmath53 sector .",
    "some more aspects of this synergy in the context of susy have been discussed in the proceedings elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest ways to look for new physics related to ew symmetry breaking beyond is through measurements of the anomalous couplings of the gauge bosons  @xcite , due to the contribution of the @xmath54-channel diagrams .",
    "[ fig7 ]  @xcite shows a comparison of the potential of the different colliders for measurements of these anomalous couplings for the photon .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    we see that while for the anomalous coupling @xmath55 the plc would perform better than a 500 gev ilc , for the case of @xmath56 the situation is different .",
    "this is a somewhat representative in this context .",
    "the plc has interesting possibilities for the models with extra dimensions since gravitons have large couplings to gluons and photons , the polarisation of photons can also be used for spin determination .",
    "studies in the context of a @xmath11 collider do exist  @xcite .",
    "however , to my mind much more detailed analysis needs to be done in this case .",
    "one of the examples of things that still need to be done is discussed below .",
    "for example , @xmath46 production in the process @xmath57 can be used very effectively  @xcite to probe the large extra dimensions .",
    "receives the usual qed @xmath58 channel contribution and the s - channel exchange of the tower of virtual kaluza klein particles .",
    "the add  @xcite model has two parameters : effective string scale @xmath59 and effective coupling @xmath60 upto a sign ambiguity .",
    "the reach in @xmath59 can be already quite large just using rates .",
    "for a 500 gev machine , the reach , eg . , is 1.6 tev .",
    "this can be further maximised by use of rapidity distributions and polarisation .",
    "however , this and similar other analysis are all done using the ideal backscattered laser spectrum  @xcite , which however gets modified due to multiple interaction effects which have been calculated in a monte carlo simulation  @xcite .",
    "a convenient parametrisation of the realistic spectrum is available  @xcite .",
    "the more realistic spectrum has a peak at low energies of the photon and the flux of the hard photon also gets by about a factor 2 .",
    "i present the update of the analysis  @xcite , using the more realistic spectrum  @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    thus we see that this realistic spectrum does affect the limit substantially .",
    "we can see from the right panel that the sensitivity goes down from 1.7 tev to 1.3 tev , with the realistic spectrum .",
    "it is clear from the above short discussions that there is a large potential for the lhc - ilc synergy and the study group document  @xcite has scratched only the surface so far .",
    "however , various good examples of the synergy have bee established quantitatively .",
    "there are certainly more ideas waiting to be thought about and studied .",
    "it is hard to believe , after these studies , that after ilc turn on no new questions will be asked of the lhc .",
    "it seems also clear that some overlap between lhc / ilc will therefore be necessary .",
    "more work still necessary in the context of plc , particularly the use of its unique abilities in context of extra dimensional models .",
