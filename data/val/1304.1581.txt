    "at a distance of @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 pc @xcite , the kleinmann - low nebula ( kl ) in orion is one of the nearest sites of massive star formation @xcite . the kl nebula hosts at least three , possibly more , massive protostars and the tremendous luminosity of the kl nebula ( @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xcite ) suggests that one or more of these protostars is dramatically influencing its surrounding gas and dust .",
    "owing to the extreme extinction toward this region ( @xmath10 magnitudes ; @xcite ) , the star - formation there has primarily been targeted by infrared and radio studies .",
    "the massive , luminous sources embedded in dust have elucidated the collapse phase of what will become massive stars .",
    "the kl region plays host to several heavily - reddened sources of kinematic and radiative energy that may be the powering sources of the region . among these",
    "is the becklin - neugebauer object ( bn ) , and the compact thermal radio sources ` i ' and ` n ' .",
    "the bn object , first recognized as a massive protostar by @xcite , has been classified as a b0 star @xcite .",
    "nicmos polarization studies have revealed that bn heats its surrounding disk environment but is likely not the source of heating for the nebula @xcite .",
    "several other bright , diffuse infrared sources may also contribute to the luminosity , including irc 4 @xcite ; however , no stellar point sources have been detected .",
    "radio sources ` i ' and ` n ' are thought to be associated with the formation of at least two other massive stars @xcite , and there are numerous other sources bright at near- and mid - infrared wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , source i may be the dominant source of energy in the kl region .    the nature of source i has been under debate in recent years .",
    "it is completely obscured at all infrared wavelengths out to at least 37 @xmath1 m @xcite , and is only detected as a color temperature peak in a 7.8 @xmath1m/12.4 @xmath1 m color - temperature analysis @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the radio continuum measured from source i directly coincides with the centroid of sio maser emission seen at 43.1 ghz , suggesting that source i is the source powering the maser emission .",
    "this hypothesis was further supported by 87 ghz observations of thermal sio emission @xcite , detected as a large bipolar outflow extending from the northeast to the southwest for at least eight arcseconds .",
    "the outflow has also been seen in submillimeter line emission ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the 3-mm sio maser emission occurs at the base of the outflow in an * @xmath11 * -shaped pattern @xcite .",
    "there has not been a universal consensus on the orientation of the disk and outflow @xcite , but @xcite argue rather compellingly that the semi - major axis of the disk must be oriented northwest to southeast , and this is currently the predominant paradigm .",
    "the obscuration of source i may , in large part , be due to obscuration by its own edge - on disk , centered on the radio point source . both @xcite and @xcite",
    "have imaged source i in 7-mm radio continuum , which shows that the radio extension is perpendicular to the outflow revealed by sio emission .",
    "this led @xcite and @xcite to suggest that the radio emission arises from the ionized surface of the inner disk .",
    "the detection at near- to mid - infrared wavelengths of the disk surrounding the radio point source has been elusive due to the high extinction in the region @xcite . characterizing the protostellar disk surrounding source i would allow us to paint a more complete picture of massive star formation , since very few disks around young , massive stars have been characterized satisfactorily ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the only previous high - angular resolution infrared imaging of the region around source i  the irc 2 region  was presented by @xcite ( see figure 1 for the proximity of source i to the irc 2 region ) . with an average spatial resolution of @xmath12 0.\"5 , they were able to resolve the four components of the irc 2 region ( irc 2a , 2b , 2c , and 2d ; see figure 7 in that paper ) using a deconvolution method on data taken at the 4 meter kitt peak mayall telescope .    we present @xmath3 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 imaging of the bn / kl region using laser guide star adaptive optics on the keck ii 10-m telescope , the deepest and highest - resolution near - infrared imaging of the region to date .",
    "this deep imaging allows us to construct intensity and color - temperature maps of the region that show the infrared counterpart to the disk around radio source i. we are able to achieve an average angular resolution of 0.\"09 at @xmath0 .",
    "these high angular resolution data allow us to distinctively see the extended emission and to resolve the point sources in the region .",
    "section 2 of this paper discusses the observations ; the data reduction and analysis procedures are presented in section 3 .",
    "section 4 presents our primary finding , and section 5 provides a discussion of the properties of the disk around radio source i. we summarize our conclusions and the implications for future work in section 6 .",
    "the orion bn / kl star - forming region was observed using laser guide star adaptive optics ( lgsao ; @xcite , @xcite ) on 2010 october 30 - november 1 at the w. m. keck ii 10-meter telescope with the facility near - infrared camera , nirc2 ( pi : k. matthews ) .",

    "the natural seeing was @xmath12 0.5 arcseconds during both nights .",
    "the laser guide star corrected for most of the atmospheric aberrations , but the low - order tip - tilt terms were corrected using visible light observations of parenago 1839 ( @xmath18 = 05:35:14.64 , @xmath19 = -05:22:33.7 ; @xmath20 = 13.8 ; see figure 1 for placement in our field of view ) .",
    "sky frames at @xmath0 and @xmath2 were taken interspersed with science observations in a dark region @xmath21 degrees to the east .",
    "sky observations were timed such that the field rotator mirror angle was identical to that of the science exposures .",

    "the data were run through the standard reduction pipeline that the ucla group has developed for reduction of adaptive optics data on the galactic center ( e.g. , @xcite ) , including dark and flat - field correction , sky subtraction , removal of bad pixels and cosmic rays , correction for differential atmospheric refraction , and application of the nirc2 distortion map @xcite . for each @xmath0 and @xmath2 science exposure ,",
    "a series of sky exposures was subtracted where the sky and science exposures had matching angles on the field rotator mirror , in order to properly subtract any thermal emission from dust on the mirror optics . for the @xmath3 science exposures ,",
    "the skies were combined into a single image used for background subtraction .",
    "images were registered and combined using the iraf / pyraf modules _ xregister _ and _ drizzle_. the reduced data typically had strehl ratios of @xmath12 0.25 , 0.5 , and 0.52 and fwhms of @xmath1265 , 85 , and 105 mas at @xmath3 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the individual images were combined into both the final average image as well as three subimages , each comprised of one - third of the data in order to estimate photometric and astrometric uncertainties .",
    "radio source i has never been detected in the near - infrared , so its position in the near - infrared is unknown .",
    "however , the nearby source , ",
    "n \" , is detected at both radio and infrared wavelengths and is used to astrometrically register our infrared images to the radio reference frame .    to extract precise astrometry for all sources within our infrared images , we use the idl package _ starfinder _ @xcite .",
    "_ starfinder _ iteratively extracts a point spread function ( psf ) from a set of user - selected stars and identifies point sources within the field of view .",
    "we implement a version of _ starfinder _ that has been modified to trim out sources that are likely to be artifacts of imperfect psf knowledge , as described in @xcite .",

    "these sources were selected because they were far enough away from the edge of the detector that they did not suffered minimal flux loss , and they were not immersed in extended emission .",
    "the resulting psf was used to identify candidate sources in the image that exceed a psf correlation threshold of 0.7 and 0.9 in the subimages and main map respectively .",
    "astrometry and photometry for the candidate sources are computed through psf fitting .",
    "candidate sources are declared stars if they are detected in the fully combined image and in all subimages .",
    "we positively identified seven point sources with a typical astrometric error of 1.5 mas and a photometric error of @xmath12 20% .",
    "precision astrometry from _ starfinder _ was necessary to find the sub - pixel position of source n in our near - infrared images .",
    "we used the near - infrared image position coupled with the known radio proper motion and radio position of source n ( @xcite ; see table 2 below ) to make source n the origin of our coordinate system .",
    "the radio positions in table 2 are from 13 nov 2000 @xcite ; with the proper motions given in table 2 , we translated those positions to the same 2010 epoch as the nirc2 data to find the location of source i relative to source n. prior to 2006 , source n was a double in the radio ( e.g. , @xcite ) with the lobes separated by 0.373 @xmath6 0.013 arcseconds in april 1994 @xcite , but it appeared as a point source in the near - infrared @xcite .",
    "source n became a single radio object by 2006 @xcite , so we do not need to correct for the ambiguities represented by a double source .",
    "the proper motion of radio source i has been well - studied ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in an effort to reduce the error on any astrometric measurement of source i , we compiled and combined the absolute positions from @xcite and @xcite and applied a linear least - squares fit to the right ascension and declination , weighted by the uncertainties in the positions of the source .",
    "this fit yielded proper motions of @xmath24 = 4.26 @xmath6 0.63 mas / year and @xmath25 = -5.52 @xmath6 0.68 mas / year in the absolute coordinate system ( figure 2 and table 2 ) .",

    "we present the first detection of an infrared counterpart to the disk seen in the radio continuum associated with source i in the bottom panels of figure 3 .",
    "we see a sharp intensity edge close to , and parallel with , the almost edge - on disk that is seen in the radio .",
    "this feature is most prominently seen in the color - temperature image made with the @xmath0 and @xmath2 bands ( see section 3.3 ) .",
    "the color - temperature of the surface of the counterpart visible in our nirc2 data is lower than that of the ambient medium ( see section 5.2 for discussion ) .",
    "the counterpart is not evident at @xmath3 due to high extinction ( as high as @xmath30 58 magnitudes in the nearby irc 2 region ; @xcite ) .",
    "the emission in the @xmath0 and @xmath2 intensity maps that we interpret as arising from the surface of the disk implied by the radio data , while clearly present , is somewhat confused with source irc 2a ( see below and section 5.2 ) .",
    "the semi - major axis of the disk counterpart is situated northwest to southeast , in agreement with the orientation of the circumstellar disk associated with source i inferred by @xcite .",
    "there is also a hint of infrared emission from the outflow that is nearly perpendicular to the disk and that has been inferred from thermal sio emission ( see section 5.1 ) .",
    "the region containing the infrared counterpart to the source i disk is a complex , extended source called irc 2 , in which several thermal infrared peaks have been identified ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most of the infrared radiation from irc 2 at 2.2 , 3.7 , and 4.8 @xmath1 m is extended in nature .",
    "all of the components of irc 2 are resolved in our data except irc 2c , which emits only about 10% of the total radiation from irc 2 . the nearest component to source",
    "i is irc 2a , which we resolve into two separate components , irc 2a - ne and irc 2a - sw ( see section 5 ) .",
    "we speculate that these dust blobs are interlopers that lie within , or at the boundary of , the cone of illumination above the disk of source i. indeed , irc 2a does not appear as a separate feature in the color - temperature map , suggesting that the dust within it is subject to the same radiation field as the dust in the contiguously projected flared disk of source i. we are currently investigating the relative proper motions of irc 2a and the source i disk , and will present that in a separate publication .",
    "( see figure 1 ) ; zooming into the boxed region , we see that this region is devoid of any emission at @xmath3 ( upper right frame ) . however , in @xmath0 and @xmath2 , we are able to see a peculiar morphology having a sharp lower edge .",
    "we interpret this feature and its sharp edge as the emission from the disk surface occulted by the opaque foreground portions of the disk . in the intensity maps",
    ", the disk appears to be confused by the infrared source irc 2a , which is potentially an illuminated dust blob .",
    "all yellow dots denote the position of radio source i. the white line in the color - temperature map in the lower right frame corresponds to the intensity cut shown in figure 5 .",
    "the cut is oriented 45@xmath27 east of north .",
    "the color - temperature map in this case corresponds to the blackbody - derived temperature between the @xmath0 and @xmath2 images.,width=680 ]",
    "we interpret the sharp infrared edge as being the self - occulted , illuminated surface of the disk associated with source i. this flared edge - on disk completely obscures the central protostar and inner disk , but the disk surface is illuminated in the flared outer regions and scatters starlight and emits thermally at the observed wavelengths ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "the infrared counterpart to source i manifest in the @xmath0 and @xmath2 images strongly suggests that we are seeing some combination of scattered or thermal light emanating from the disk .",
    "the outflow originating from radio source i has previously been indicated by the distribution of sio maser emission @xcite , and the disk has been seen in 7-mm radio continuum ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our detection of the upper surface of the inferred disk in both our color - temperature map and @xmath0 and @xmath2 intensity maps corresponds well with these previous radio studies .",
    "source i lies southwest of the infrared counterpart where the sharp edge in the infrared color - temperature map is at a position angle of @xmath31 and appears to be well - aligned with the projected radio disk major axis identified by @xcite and @xcite . in order to compare the observations with radio observations of the disk , we over - plot the maser spots from @xcite ( which arise from sio @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 1  0 emission ) onto the @xmath0/@xmath2 color - temperature map in figure 4 .",
    "we propose that the offset of source i from the near - infrared edge seen in the nirc2 data is caused by the obscuration of the region around the central star by the thick disk .",
    "the sio maser emission spots are consistent with being at the inward ( obscured ) extension of the conical or flared surface of the disk that we see further out in the infrared ( see middle panel of figure 4 ) .",
    "furthermore , the darkest ( coldest ) region in the color - temperature map of figure 4 lies slightly closer to the position of source i than the @xmath0 scattered light disk .",
    "this is a typical effect ascribable to the wavelength - dependent opacity of the circumstellar material lying in front of the disk itself @xcite , which suggests that the opacity of the dust in the circumstellar material between @xmath0 and @xmath2 is chromatic ( i.e. , non - grey ) .",
    "the models we present in section 5.2 fulfill this criterion .",
    "the right panel of figure 4 shows the radio extension of source i superposed on the color - temperature map of the visible portion of the disk .",
    "the contours represent 7-mm continuum intensity from the very large array @xcite after subtraction of a gaussian point source at the location of source i. the continuum is well - aligned with the inferred disk edge depicted in the color map ; the radio edge of the contours follows the darker - color region of our disk as seen in figure 4 .",
    "these 7-mm data presumably trace the dense mid - plane , whereas our near - infrared imaging traces the emission arising from the disk surface .",
    "the offset of the edge of the disk to the position of source i is reasonable , although higher than average , for an edge - on disk .",
    "the half - height of the disk is 67 @xmath6 12 au , estimated by measuring the distance between the position of source i and the lowest color temperature in the disk upper surface and assuming a nearly edge - on geometry .",
    "while there are no other known massive protostars with directly observed circumstellar disks , we can compare the source i disk to those in lower mass systems .",
    "hh 30 has a @xmath35-band separation of 70 au between the two reflection nebula @xcite ; at @xmath0 , hv tau c has a full separation of only 33 au @xcite , while hk tau b has an even smaller separation of 23 au @xcite .",
    "an example of an intermediate - mass herbig star with a known disk is pds 144 , but the distance to it is still highly uncertain so that no estimate is available for the physical separation of the two lobes of the nebula @xcite .",
    "the concave shape we observe presumably arises from the inner cavity wall being carved by the outflow .",
    "a hint of the outflow is present in the color - temperature map ( figure 4 ) , where the emission appears cooler along the outflow axis relative to its immediate surroundings ; presumably the counter jet is either not present or is obscured . a plot of surface brightness as a function of offset from source i at @xmath0 along the outflow axis at an angle of @xmath36 east of north is shown in figure 5 .",

    "figure 14 in @xcite compares the differences in these models .",
    "while both of these examples are low - mass analogues to source i , @xcite also invokes a similar geometry to describe the environment around pds 144n , an intermediate - mass system .",
    "furthermore , introducing the cavity is necessary since we see  walls \" at the disk periphery in the color - temperature maps , and it is consistent with the outflow arising from source i. the cavity is also consistent with previous simulations by @xcite , as it produces a wide - angle outflow . the flat and thick disk between 50 and 400 au acts as an opaque screen that attenuates the light from the southern - far - side nebula .",

    "the top row shows the model images without the inclusion of foreground extinction or irc 2a , while the middle row shows the same models including both foreground extinction and irc 2a .",
    "we assumed irc 2a consists of two separate point sources whose flux and position we have adjusted to roughly match observations .",
    "the bottom row shows our data from nirc2.,width=680 ]    figure 7 depicts our disk models by presenting the intensities and the intensity ratio of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 data compared to those of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 model images with @xmath48 .",
    "we are able to reconstruct the basic morphology of the inferred disk with this model that contains both an envelope and disk component , namely a flat structure , and an obscured counternebula .",
    "the images in figure 7 have been convolved with the respective psfs extracted from _ starfinder _ ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "the top row of the model images do not include any foreground extinction outside of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "a comparison with the data in figure 7 shows how the region around our inferred disk surface has a different flux ratio than those of our models , which could arise from the lack of inclusion of the foreground extinction .",
    "if present , this will further redden the appearance of source i and can account for the systematic offset in color between our observations and models .",
    "studies from spitzer @xcite show that @xmath49/@xmath50 - @xmath51/@xmath50 @xmath12 0.1 . if @xmath52 magnitudes of extinction @xcite , then @xmath53 magnitudes , implying that there will be an extra 0.6 magnitudes in the observed @xmath0 - @xmath2 colors compared to our models .",
    "the middle row of figure 7 includes this 0.6 magnitudes of foreground extinction , and includes the source irc 2a",
    ". a much better fit to the data is obtained .",
    "we still have too much scattering well above the disk , which is a consequence of using a spherically symmetric envelope instead of a rotationally - supported envelope .",
    "a rotationally - supported envelope may produce a model with a more consistent gradient than what we depict with our spherically symmetric envelope .",
    "we are seeing the disk in a combination of thermal and scattered light , along with foreground absorption from part of the envelope .",
    "the emission is mostly thermal , as scattered light from the central star only contributes @xmath12 0.5% of the total emission at @xmath0 and is relatively cool in the first place .",
    "the thermal emission favors longer wavelengths since the emitting dust is not very hot .",
    "regions with colder color - temperatures ( dark - colored in figure 7 ) arise due to the wavelength - dependence of the dust opacity . at longer wavelengths like @xmath2 ,",
    "the optical depth through the envelope is lower .",
    "that is , the emitting region is embedded in the envelope and the @xmath0 photons are less likely to reach us than @xmath2 photons .",
    "previous studies of grains in protoplanetary disks have shown evidence for grains significantly larger than those found in the interstellar medium , and several other systems show evidence for grains much larger than one micron ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these large grains scatter efficiently in the near - infrared , so the photons thermally emitted in the innermost regions of the disk can thus be scattered off the outer edge of the disk without a strong blueing effect . in fact , our models have a maximum grain size of only one micron , yet our colors are still relatively red ; our assumed dust population has an albedo @xmath54 0.5 out to @xmath12 4.8 microns .",
    "the source appears red because even grains of only 1 micron are quite effective scatterers out to @xmath12 5 microns .",
    "additionally , measuring near - infrared colors that are redder than those of the underlying star in the edge - on disk is further reinforced by the high stellar luminosity that heats the dust substantially , similarly to pds 144n @xcite , and the presence of a surrounding , quasi - optically - thick envelope .",
    "the optically thick envelope produces reddening , as any photons scattered out of the light beam must pass through the envelope and cylindrical cavity .",
    "the presumably massive star associated with radio source i has been considered to potentially be the product of a stellar merger @xcite related to the violent dynamical interaction some 500 years ago of a non - hierarchal multiple system of massive protostars . according to this hypothesis , this interaction not only gave rise to the cataclysmic event of the nw - se omc 1 explosive outflow (  the fingers of orion , \" @xcite ) , but also to the ejection and proper motion of source i and source n to the south and bn to the north @xcite .",
    "in that scenario , as @xcite describe , source i after the interaction would either be a close binary system of @xmath1210 solar mass objects with an orbital separation of the order of 1 au or a bloated 20 @xmath55 object resulting from the merger of two close binary components ( @xcite ; portegies - zwart , personal communication ) .",
    "the bloated star would relax to a smaller size and hotter temperature on a thermal kelvin - helmholtz timescale ( estimated to be @xmath1210@xmath56 years ) , but would still appear bloated now , as the suggested interaction would have taken place only 500 years ago .",
    "the proposed interaction would likely have eliminated any pre - existing disk around source i , so this model would require that the disk be reformed . a merger of the binary could provide the resulting massive star with substantial angular momentum , so an extruded , hot inner disk around the star might be expected .",
    "the _ outer _ disk and dense envelope in this scenario would be the result of bondi - hoyle accretion onto the merger product ( or tight binary ) from a medium having a significant density or velocity gradient orthogonal to the stellar motion .",
    "this new gas is presumably captured from the dense surrounding medium ( omc1 hot core , density @xmath1210@xmath57 @xmath58 ) into which it is hypothesized to be moving at a relative speed of about 10 km s@xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the model posits that source i is moving close to the plane of the sky and that the angular momentum vector of the newly accreted disk would lie in a plane orthogonal to the stellar velocity vector , so that the apparent major axis of such a disk as projected onto the plane of the sky will be aligned with the proper motion vector .",
    "thus , while the model does not dictate that this new disk of source i also be oriented edge - on , the predicted disk orientation is completely consistent with the observed 7-mm vla disk structure , and the collimated outflow associated with the thermal and maser sio emission .",
    "whether this speculative dynamical scenario is applicable and can be reconciled with our keck / nirc2 observations , which point to a more regular rather than a presumably chaotic disk / envelope structure , is an open question .",
    "time - dependent relaxation phenomena may be observable in the future to support the dynamical scenario .",
    "we have detected a near - infrared counterpart to radio source i in the bn / kl region of orion in our nirc2 @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 color - temperature maps .",
    "we interpret this counterpart as the protostellar disk around radio source i. in the intensity maps , it is confused by the infrared source irc 2a , the nearby near - infrared peak .",
    "the morphology of the extended disk emission is also prominently traced in the color - temperature map .",
    "the orientation and the nearly edge - on aspect of the infrared emission from the disk are consistent with the 7-mm continuum observations of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the morphology and flared behavior of the disk are very consistent with the geometry suggested by the sio maser emission spots from @xcite .",
    "we have modeled the near - infrared counterpart to source i with a full dust radiative transfer model that includes an envelope .",
    "our models indicate that we are seeing the disk in both thermal emission from particles heated by source i , along with scattered light from source i. the disk appears red in our ratio images because we are looking at part of the emission through the foreground screen that arises from the wall of the cylindrical cavity .",
    "light scattering through this screen causes differential extinction , as discussed in section 5.2 .",
    "our keck observations coupled with our mcfost models support the hypothesis that the morphological shape we see above source i in our color - temperature map is a consequence of disk emission .",
    "further progress in understanding the disk of source i can be made when direct measurements of line emission become possible .",
    "if the disk is ionized , as @xcite and @xcite have argued , then interferometric measurements of radio recombination lines might be valuable , and if it remains predominantly molecular , then alma should eventually reveal its constituents and dynamics .",
