    "the discovery of the cosmic background radiation ( cmb ) [ 1 ] revived the theory of the hot origin of the universe ( the big - bang model ) .",
    "the cmb was originally a prediction of the theory of gamow and his collaborators which was worked out in the late 1940 s in the context of investigating the origin of the natural abundance of elements .",
    "the most refined analysis along this line predicted a cosmic background radiation at a temperature about @xmath0 k ( for a concise recent review of the subject see ref . [ 2 ] ) .",
    "however , since the gamow model started with the universe at the times when the temperature was about @xmath1 k , the new interest in the origin of the universe sought much earlier times at much higher temperatures . in the light of the absence of a full quantum theory of gravity , the works dealing with the state of the universe at very early times had to consider the quantized matter fields in the classical background of the universe as described by the theory of general relativity .",
    "matter fields were brought into connection with spacetime curvature through the calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath2  [ 3 - 7 ] . in these works and the similar ones that followed ,",
    "quantum gravity and matter are truncated at the one loop level . for free matter fields ,",
    "there are no higher loop processes anyway .",
    "the contribution from graviton is of zeroth order in g. as the loop expansion is an expansion in _",
    "h-.2em.2em , _ the theory truncated at the _ _  _ _ one loop level contains all terms of the complete theory of order _ _",
    "h-.2em.2em__and is , in that sense , the first order quantum correction to general relativity _ _  _ _ [ 8]_. _    the motivations for studying the vacuum expectation value of the energy- momentum tensor stems from the fact that @xmath3 is a local quantity that can be defined at a specific spacetime point , contrary to the particle concept which is global .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor also acts as a source of gravity in the einstein field equations , therefore @xmath2 plays an important role in any attempt to model a self - consistent dynamics involving the classical gravitational field coupled to the quantized matter fields .",
    "so , once @xmath2 is calculated in a specified background geometry , we can substitute it on the rhs of the einstein field equations and demand self consistency , i.e. @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the ricci tensor , @xmath6 is the metric tensor , @xmath7 is the scalar curvature , and @xmath8 is the so - called cosmological constant .    the solution of ( [ q1 ] ) will determine the development of the spacetime in presence of the given matter field , for which the vacuum state @xmath9 can be unambiguously defined .",
    "this is known as the  back reaction problem  .",
    "it is interesting to perform the calculation of @xmath2 in friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) models because the real universe is , more or less , a sophisticated form of the friedman models .",
    "however the time - dependence of the spacetime metric generally creates unsolvable fundamental problems .",
    "one such a problem was the definition of vacuum in a time - dependent background [ 9 ] ; a time - dependent background is eligible for producing particles continuously , therefore , pure vacuum states in the minkowskian sense do not exist .",
    "also an investigation into the thermodynamics of a time - dependent systems lacks the proper definition of thermal equilibrium , which is a basic necessity for studying finite - temperature field theory in curved backgrounds.[10 ] .",
    "the static einstein universe stands the above two fundamental challenges .",
    "first , being static , the einstein universe leaves no ambiguity in defining the vacuum both locally and globally .",
    "the same feature also allows for thermal equilibrium to be defined unambiguously .",
    "furthermore , the einstein static metric is conformal to all robertson - walker metrics , and this property enabled kennedy [ 10 ] to show that the thermal green functions for the static einstein universe and the time - dependent robertson - walker universe are conformally related , hence deducing a ( 1 - 1 ) correspondence between the vacuum and the many particle states of both universes .",
    "so that , under the equilibrium condition , the thermodynamics of quantum fields in an einstein universe of radius @xmath10 is equivalent to that of an instantaneously static friedman - roberson - walker universe of equal radius [ 3,6 , 11 ] .",
    "this means that the results obtained in frw universe would be qualitatively the same as those obtained in an einstein universe .",
    "although not a realistic cosmological model , the einstein universe remains to be a useful theoretical tool to achieve better understanding of the interplay of spacetime curvature and of quantum field theoretic effects .",
    "the recent findings of plunien _",
    "et al_. [ 12 ] that finite temperatures can enhance the pure vacuum effect by several orders of magnitude , can be used to explain the behavior of the system during the casimir ( vacuum ) regime . since this means that the finite temperature corrections will surely enhance the positive vacuum energy density of closed system causing it to behave , thermodynamically , as being controlled by the vacuum energy .",
    "recently [ 13 ] ( hereafter will be referred to as i ) we have investigated the back reaction effects of the conformally coupled massless scalar field and the photon field at finite temperatures in the background of the einstein static universe . in each case",
    "we found a relationship between the temperature of the system and the radius of the einstein universe .",
    "this relation exhibit a minimum radius below which no self - consistent solution for the einstein field equations can be found .",
    "a maximum temperature is also spotted marking the transition from the vacuum dominated state to the radiation dominated state .",
    "motivated by the above findings , and in order to complete the picture of the back reaction of the spinor fields at finite temperatures in the einstein universe , we will investigate in this paper the case of the neutrino field and will deduce the relationship between the temperature and the radius , and will consequently find the minimum radius and the maximum temperature . upon the availability of all results",
    "we will compare the contributions of all the three fields , the scalar , neutrino and the photon fields .",
    "some interesting results will be discussed .",
    "we will also consider the variation of the cosmological constant with the temperature of the einstein universe in presence of the neutrino field , and then will compile the results for the massless scalar field , the neutrino field , and the photon field for comparison .",
    "the analysis shows that the smallness of the present value of the cosmological constant is understandable in the context of the behavior of massless quantum fields in this universe if they will play the role of energy -momentum source . also , we notice that the contribution from the scalar field is higher , by an order of magnitude , than the contributions of the other fields . throughout this paper",
    "we will use the natural units in which @xmath11h-.2em.2em _ _  _ _ @xmath12",
    "the einstein static universe is one solution of the modified einstein field equations    @xmath13    _ _  _ _ the metric of the einstein static universe is given by @xmath14 \\",

    "we consider an einstein static universe being filled with massless neutrino gas in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath19 .",
    "the total energy density of the system can be written as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the zero - temperature vacuum energy density and @xmath22is the corrections for finite temperatures , which can be calculated using the mode sum    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the eigen energies and degeneracies of the @xmath26th state , and @xmath27=@xmath28 is the volume of the spatial section of the einstein universe .",
    "the back reaction of the field on the background spacetime can be studied by substituting for @xmath29 on the rhs of the einstein field equation ( 1 ) , i.e. ,    @xmath30    all the einstein field equations for the system are satisfied due to the symmetry of the einstein universe which is topologically described by @xmath31 , and also due to the structure of @xmath32 in this geometry which is diagonal and traceless , and is given by ( see [ 8],p.186 )    @xmath33    since we are interested in the energy density , we will consider @xmath34 only . in order to eliminate @xmath8 from ( [ q5 ] )",
    "we multiply both sides with @xmath6 and sum over @xmath35 and @xmath36 , then using the fact that @xmath37 for massless fields , and for the einstein universe @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , we get    @xmath41    note that in the general case conformal anomalies do appear in the expression for @xmath42 , but because of the high symmetry enjoyed by the einstein universe these anomalies do not appear and @xmath43 is found to be traceless for massless particles .",
    "the solution of the dirac equation in an einstein universe has been considered by schrodinger [ 14 ] and more recently by unruh [ 15 ] .",
    "the eigen energies are found to be    @xmath44    with degeneracy , for the four - component neutrino    @xmath45    the zero - temperature vacuum energy density of the neutrino field in the background of an einstein universe is given by [ 3 ]    @xmath46    neutrinos obey fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "thus the total energy density of the system at finite temperature can be written , in terms of the mode - sum in eq .",
    "( [ q4 ] ) , as    @xmath47    in the low - temperature limit the result reduce to [ 15 ]    @xmath48    substituting this in eq .",
    "( [ q6 ] ) we get    @xmath49    this is the minimum radius for an einstein static universe filled with massless neutrinos at finite temperatures . note that @xmath50  here is less than one planckian length @xmath51 , this goes beyond the range of validity of the quasi - classical approximation adopted in the present work .",
    "but fortunately , the region of validity of the approach can be extended if one takes the number of fields large enough ( see for instance ref . [ 17 ] ) .    in the high temperature ( or large radius )",
    "limit the result is [ 16 ]    @xmath52    where @xmath53 .",
    "the back - reaction of the field can be studied if we substitute eq .",
    "( [ q15 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ q6 ] ) , where this time we obtain    @xmath54    the solutions for this equation are depicted in fig .",
    "1 , where we see that the behavior is qualitatively the same as that encountered in the conformally coupled scalar field case and the photon case in i. again , two regimes are recognized : one corresponding to small values of @xmath55 where the temperature rises sharply reaching a maximum at @xmath56 k at a radius @xmath57 cm . since this regime is controlled by the vacuum energy ( the casimir energy ) , therefore we prefer to call it the  casimir regime  .",
    "the second regime is what we call the  planck regime  , which correspond to large values of @xmath55 , and in which the temperature asymptotically approaches zero for very large values of @xmath10 .",
    "the background ( tolman ) temperature of the neutrino field is    @xmath58    at a radius of @xmath59 cm ( the present hubble length ) , we obtain a background temperature of @xmath60 k , and if we require the background temperature to have the same value as the average value of the neutrino background temperature of 1.94 k , the radius of the einstein universe has to be @xmath61 cm",
    ". again more than two orders of magnitude larger than the estimated value of hubble length .    comparing the temperature for neutrinos from eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) with eq .",
    "( 21 ) from i , we immediately see that the ratio of the neutrino temperature to the photon temperature is    @xmath62    this may be compared with the standard ratio of the neutrino temperature to the photon temperature , generated in excess because of the heating of the photons by the electron positron annihilation , calculated according to the standard big bang scenario ( see [ 18 ] , p.537 )    @xmath63    fig 2 .",

    "the cosmological constant was introduced by einstein in order to account for mach principle and to justify the equilibrium of a static universe against its own gravitational attraction .",
    "the possibility that the universe may be expanding led einstein to abandon the idea of a static universe and , along with it the cosmological constant .",
    "however the einstein static universe remained to be of interest to theoreticians since it provided a useful model to achieve better understanding of the interplay of spacetime curvature and of quantum field theoretic effects .",
    "recent years have witnessed a resurgence of interest in the possibility that a positive cosmological constant @xmath65 may dominate the total energy density in the universe ( for recent reviews see [ 19 ] and [ 20 ] ) .",
    "this interest stems from the recent observations of high redshift type ia supernovae , which appear to suggest that the universe is accelerating with large fraction of the cosmological density in the form of a cosmological constant @xmath8 . at a theoretical level @xmath65",
    "is predicted to arise out of the zero - point quantum vacuum fluctuations of the fundamental quantum fields . using parameters arising in the electroweak theory results in a value of the vacuum energy density @xmath66 gev@xmath67 which is almost @xmath68 times larger than the current observational upper limit on @xmath8 which is @xmath69 gev@xmath70 gm/@xmath71 . on the other hand the qcd vacuum",
    "is expected to generate a cosmological constant of the order of @xmath72 gev@xmath67 which is many orders of magnitude larger than the observed value .",
    "this is known as the old cosmological constant problem .",
    "the new cosmological constant problem is to understand why @xmath73 is not only small but also , as the current observations seem to indicate , is of the same order of magnitude as the present mass density of the universe .    in what follows we are going to investigate how the value of the cosmological constant changes in the context of the presence of the massless quantum fields in the background of an einstein universes having different temperatures ( or radii ) as a consequence of the back reaction effect .",
    "this investigation may be considered ",
    "phenomenological  , in the sense that no attempt is made to derive the model from an underlaying quantum field theory in contrast to the customary approach normally adopted for such calculations .",
    "contracting the field equations in ( [ q5 ] ) we find that    @xmath74    on the other hand the einstein field equations reduces to    @xmath75    and    @xmath76    where @xmath77 .",
    "solving the above two equations we obtain    @xmath78    using ( [ 23 ] ) and the results obtained in the previous section for the dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath10 we can solve for the dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath19 .",
    "( 3 ) depicts the relationship between the cosmological constant @xmath65 and the temperature for successive states of the einstein universe under the effect of back reaction of the neutrino field at finite temperatures .",
    "it shows that the back reaction of finite - temperature quantum fields in this model provide a large value for the cosmological constant during the casimir regime ( vacuum dominated state of the universe ) . from the point of view of inflationary models this large value of @xmath8",
    "is needed to resolve the problem of horizon and the problem of flatness , and possibly to generate seed fluctuations for galaxy formation [ 19 ] . on the other hand the value of the cosmological constant today , according to the a above analysis , should be very small .",
    "( 4 ) compiles the data for the three massless fields : the scalar , the neutrino and the photon field using the respective results for the radius temperature relationship reported in i. it is clear that the contribution of the scalar field to the cosmological constant is dominant , by an order of magnitude , over all other fields throughout the casimir regime and most of the planckian regime .",
    "however as we consider larger and larger spatial sections of the einstein universe the temperature goes asymptotically to zero and the value of the cosmological constants for all the three fields approaching one another .    by presenting these results we do not claim that the cosmological constant problem is solved , but at least it may give us a glimpse of how the problem is trivially solved within the context of an einstein static universe .",
    "obviously the real universe is time - dependent , and a series of successive instantaneously static states of the dynamical universe lacks all the geometrodynamical effects ; for example in this case particle production is one important effect that is lost .",
    "the present study exhibited some features of the thermodynamical behavior of the einstein static universe in presence of the neutrino field . in presenting the results of this investigation we stress the fact that due to the static nature of the einstein universe , the following results are specific to the case considered and",
    "should not be taken to imply an evolving cosmological state . however , although not a realistic cosmological model , the einstein universe provide a useful theoretical model to achieve better understanding of the interplay of spacetime curvature and of quantum field theoretic effects .",
    "the main findings of this work reinforces the results reported in i , with one additional point concerning the cosmological constant , these are      \\(2 ) the universe avoids the singularity at @xmath79 through quantum effects ( the casimir effect ) because of the non - zero value of @xmath21 .",
    "a non - zero expectation value of the vacuum energy density always implies a symmetry breaking event .",
    "\\(3 ) during the casimir regime the universe is totally controlled by vacuum .",
    "the energy content of the universe is a function of its radius . using the conformal relation between the static einstein universe and the closed frw universe [ 10 ] ,",
    "this result indicates that in a frw  model there would be a continuous creation of energy out of vacuum as long as the universe is expanding , a result which was confirmed by parker long ago [ 21 ] .",
    "the steep , nearly vertical line in fig .",
    "2 suggests that the real universe started violently and had to relax later .",
    "\\(4 ) throughout the casimir regime the cosmological constant @xmath8 has a large value for all three fields , and is nearly constant , but once the universe goes to planck regime the value of @xmath8 drops sharply . in the realistic models for a dynamical universe ,",
    "a large value for the cosmological constant during the very early stages of the universe is required so as to solve - via inflation- the horizon and flatness problem [ 19 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the value for the cosmological constant at present should be small in order to comply with observations .",
    "the results presented in this paper , though may not be directly related to a developing universe , provides us with the required behavior .",
