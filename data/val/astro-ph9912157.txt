    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) show different morphologies , but since the works of kwok et al .",
    "( 1978 ) and @xcite , it is possible to reproduce their observed shape basically with two types of geometry : spherico - elliptical ones and bi - polar ones ( also called butterfly ) , all of them axi - symmetrical in a first approximation .    observed morphological differences may result from ( 1 ) different orientation of the line - of - sight and of the axis of symmetry and ( 2 ) the age of the nebula .",
    "morphological sequences have been studied by balick ( 1987 ) , pascoli ( 1990 ) and zhang & kwok ( 1998 ) , among others .",
    "evolutionary theories based on the generalized interacting stellar wind model ( gisw , see franck & mellema 1994 and references therein ) seem to confirm these interpretations .",
    "information obtained from photometric imaging and intermediate resolution spectra have been complemented by narrow band images ( e.g. , sahai et al . 1997 ) and high resolution spectra ( e.g. , walton et al .",
    "1990 ) , providing information on the kinematics of the nebula .",
    "the various observations can not be correctly interpreted without detailed modeling , which must consistently reproduce all observational data .",
    "for some years , most of the data have been analysed by gisw models ( soker & livio 1989 ; mellema , eulderink & icke 1991 ; icke , balick & frank 1992 ) , which account only for the gas dynamics .",
    "a more realistic model to analyse morphologies and kinematics of pne was proposed by frank & mellema ( 1994 ) .",
    "these 2d simulations include radiation processes and ionization balance , while the gas cooling through line emission is obtained from polynomial approximations for the line emissivities ( balick et al .",
    "1993 ) .    here",
    "a new modeling tool for studying the morphology and kinematics of pne is presented . assuming a velocity field , the results of a 3d photoionization code ( gruenwald , viegas & broguire 1997 , hereinafter gvb ) are used to generate images to be directly confronted with various kinds of observations .",
    "we address general pne issues , raised by the observations , as gas distribution and morphology , brightness enhancement at the equatorial ring , the asymmetric emission line profiles ( e.g. gesicki et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the computational methods used to model planetary nebulae are presented in  2 .",
    "results for two theoretical objects are shown and discussed in  3 .",
    "the conclusions appear in  4 .",
    "the 3d photoionization code is described in gvb .",
    "the input parameters are the ionizing radiation spectrum , the gas chemical composition and the spatial density distribution .",
    "the nebula is divided in a great number of cells . inside each cell",
    "the physical conditions , which are obtained from the ionization equilibrium and thermal balance , are assumed homogeneous .",
    "for each cell , the output are the emissivity of atomic lines and the physical conditions of the gas ( electronic density , fractional abundances , electronic temperature ) .",
    "the number of cells defines the numerical accuracy .",
    "it depends on the specific object under analysis , as well as on the computer memory .",
    "the effect of the diffuse radiation can be accounted for .",
    "however , in its present version , the required computational time is too high ( few tens of the on - the - spot case ) .",
    "thus , we assume here the on - the - spot approximation , using case b parameters of pquignot et al .",
    "( 1991 ) for the hydrogen recombination coefficient .",
    "the effect is small enough and do not affect the general conclusions presented here .",
    "the h@xmath0 luminosity is underestimated by 30@xmath1 or less when the on - the - spot approximation is assumed .",
    "the percentage depends on the stellar temperature : the higher the stellar temperature the bigger the underestimation of the h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "the differences between the line intensities relative to h@xmath0 is less than 20@xmath1 , except for the weak lines ( @xmath2 0.05 h@xmath0 ) .",
    "emission line images are obtained after a line - of - sight integration .",
    "the calculations are made assuming a stationary approximation . in order to analyse the kinematics , a velocity field",
    "is assumed after obtaining the photoionization results for each cell .",
    "the data cubes , containing the results generated by the 3d code for the cells , are read by an idl ( rsi ) code which provides the tools for filtering , rotation , projection , statistics , velocity maps and echellograms , as described below .    in this paper , only axi - symmetric nebulae will be studied . in order to increase the number of cells used in the calculations ( increasing the numerical accuracy ) , 1/8 of the nebula is modeled . for the calculated 1/8 of the nebula ,",
    "the number of cells is @xmath3 . in this case",
    ", the ionizing source is placed at one of the corners of the large cube . in order to restored the whole nebula , with the ionizing source at the center , the remaining 7/8 are added up , using the calculated 1/8 after appropriate rotations .",
    "the nebula is defined in a xyz coordinate system , where x is the axis of symmetry , the origin being at the ionizing source ( center of the rebuilt cube ) .",
    "the rotations and projections operate on a data cube of @xmath4 coordinates . in the following",
    ", the line of sight used for the projections will be @xmath5 .",
    "before any rotation the origins , as well as the axes of the xyz and @xmath4 coordinate systems , are coincident .",
    "the rotations of the data cubes are performed in the @xmath4 space , plane by plane , using the two - dimensional rot function of idl , in a @xmath6 times greater cube to avoid losing information .",
    "if needed , up to three rotations around the three axes of the cube can be performed , in any order .",
    "if rotations around more than one axis are necessary , it is easier if one starts with a rotation around an axis perpendicular to both the axis of symmetry of the nebula ( @xmath7 ) and the axis along the line - of - sight ( @xmath5 ) . in order to compare the theoretical images to observations ,",
    "a second rotation of the data cube may be needed .      for each emission line",
    "the 3d code provides the luminosity in each cell .",
    "the total luminosity ( corresponding to the whole nebula ) , as well as the intensity corresponding to a given aperture , can be obtained and compared to observational data .    the projected image on the plane of the sky is obtained for a given emission line by integrating the emissivities of the cells lying along the line - of - sight which is taken perperdicular to one of the cube faces .",
    "maps of emission line intensity ratios can also be obtained , especially those used to obtain the pn physical conditions .",
    "these maps can be transformed into density or temperature maps using relationships ( e.g. , alexander & balick 1997 ) between the projected line intensity ratios and these quantities .      in order to obtain a line profile , a cube of velocities at the same resolution as the 3d code output",
    "is generated according to a predefined law . in this paper",
    "we assume a radial velocity field . since the projection is made on the @xmath5-axis direction , only the corresponding component of the velocity is retained ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "for each emission line , a velocity profile is generated , for each line - of - sight , by    @xmath9}^2}\\ ] ]    with : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the emissivity of a given line inside the @xmath4 cell , @xmath14 is the turbulent velocity and @xmath15 is the thermal velocity of the corresponding atom of mass number a. the local electronic temperature @xmath16 is consistently obtained from the 3d code .    velocity contour maps and p - v maps ( echellograms ) can be generated .",
    "after masking through an aperture and convoluting with an instrumental profile , the theoretical data can be compared to observations .      for each emission line ,",
    "average physical quantities of the region where the line is produced can be obtained .",
    "average values for the electron temperature , density , hydrogen ionization , and velocity are calculated by weighting theses quantities by the line emissivity .",
    "the general assumed formula is : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is replaced by @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "these quantities can be obtained for the whole nebula , as well as for lines - of - sight characterized by an @xmath23 position , summing on @xmath4 or @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "notice that peimbert ( 1967 ) defined some of these quantities weighting by @xmath24 instead of by the line emissivity .",
    "dimensionless temperature fluctuations ( @xmath25 ) and density fluctuations ( @xmath26 ) can also be computed : @xmath27    empirical methods for chemical abundance determination are usually based on these averaged quantities and fluctuations , defined for the whole nebula .",
    "they have been generally applied to point - to - point observations , assuming a spherical symmetry . in this case , however , the method is not always correct , even for spherically symmetric objects ( gruenwald & viegas 1992 ) . a real nebulae is not necessarily symmetric and homogeneous .",
    "therefore , only 3d models can provide tools for improving the empirical methods .",
    "two simple theoretical pne will be assumed ( a and b ) with two possible geometries ( 1 and 2 ) .",
    "models a correspond to higher black - body temperature , higher density and higher luminosity than models b ( table [ tab - spectro ] ) . on the other hand , type 1 models have a spherical cavity surrounded by a shell with a density gradient ; the density increases linearly with the angle , from the pole to the equator .",
    "type 2 models have a prolate elliptical cavity surrounded by a constant density shell .",
    "these two geometries are two simple cases which can reproduce the bipolar brigthness enhancement usually shown by pn images .",
    "surely , the geometry of real objects is determinated by hydrodynamics .",
    "thus , a further improvement , out of the scope of this paper , would be to use the 3d photoionization code adopting a geometry obtained from a hydrodynamic code .",
    "the input parameters related to the density distribution are given in table [ tab - spectro ] .",
    "the following notation is used : n@xmath28(cav ) is the cavity density ; n@xmath28(shell ) is the shell density ( type 2 models ) , or its range ( type 1 ) ; r@xmath29 is the cavity radius ( type 1 ) or the semi - axis of the elliptical cavity ( type 2 ) .",
    "models a are inspired on the canonical pn of the paris workshop ( pquignot 1986 , see also ferland et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the adopted chemical abundances are the same for the four models , and are taken from the canonical pn , i.e. , h:1.0 , he:0.1 , c:3(-4 ) , n:1(-4 ) , o:6(-4 ) , ne:1.5(-4 ) , mg:3(-5 ) , si:3(-5 ) , s:1.5(-5 ) , cl:4(-7 ) , ar:6(-6 ) , fe:1(-7 ) .    for all models ,",
    "the pn is radiation bound in all directions .",
    "results for the 3d models a1 , a2 , b1 , and b2 , corresponding to the whole nebula , are listed in table [ tab - spectro ] .",
    "only line intensities of the main emission lines , relative to h@xmath0 , are given , as some average quantities obtained from line ratios , using alexander & balick ( 1997 ) fits or the formulae given in ",
    "[ sub - stat ] ( lower part of the table ) .",
    "the differences between the results of a1 and a2 models are not significant . for both models ,",
    "the results for line intensities are within the values obtained for the canonical pn ( spherical symmetry and constant density ) with the various 1d photoionizing codes ( ferland et al .",
    "notice that our results were obtained using the on - the - spot aproximation ( see  [ sub - sec-3d ] ) .",
    "from the point of view of the emission - line spectra , as well as of the derived physical conditions , no conclusion about the nebula geometry can be drawn , since both geometries lead to similar spectroscopical results .",
    "the same is true for a planetary nebulae with a lower stellar temperature , lower luminosity and density , as seen from the similarity between the results of models b1 and b2 .    for both ( a and b ) types of nebula ,",
    "the determination of temperature and density , from the line ratios or from the formulae (  [ sub - stat ] ) , are consistent within 10@xmath1 .",
    "the electronic temperatures obtained from the [ oiii ] and [ nii ] line ratios are different because these lines come from different regions .",
    "emission line images often show a brightness enhancement which is usually interpreted as the signature of a density gradient in the equatorial belt of pne ( @xcite ; khan & west 1985 ; aaquist & kwok 1996 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the images of h@xmath0 , [ o iii]@xmath305007 , he ii@xmath304686 , and [ n ii]@xmath306583 obtained from models a and b are given , respectively , in figs .",
    "[ fig - aa ] and [ fig - bb ] .",
    "the nebulae are projected along the y axis ( no rotation ) .",
    "the top four panels correspond to type 1 models , while the botton four ones to type 2 models . notice that type 1 and 2 models have different geometries , which might reproduce the observed enhancement . in type 1 models ,",
    "the gas density increases linearly with the angle from the pole to the equator , and is distributed around an inner spherical cavity . on the other hand , in type 2 models",
    "the gas is uniformly distributed around a prolate elliptical cavity . as suggested by the figures ,",
    "the models are able to generate the brightness enhancement .",
    "notice that the line intensity enhancement is due to the higher density in the equator for type 1 models , whereas , for type 2 models , it appears because the density of the _ ionizing photons _ reaching the inner edge of the gas is higher in the direction along the minor axis .",
    "however , the real geometry can not be easily inferred from the shape suggested by the images .",
    "in fact , model a1 images show an ellipsoidal shape , while for model a2 the shape suggests a spherical distribution , which is the opposite of the adopted shapes for the inner cavities .",
    "this contrasting behavior is less pronounced in models b , with lower stellar temperature and luminosity , as well as with lower density , than models a. the image shape given by model a2 is defined by the ionizing radiation dilution , independently of the gas distribution .",
    "on the other hand , in model b2 the main factor defining the image shape is the shape of the inner cavity .    from these results , we see that narrow band imaging may not differentiate the nebular geometry as previously assumed . in the next section",
    "we discuss a possible geometry indicator .",
    "as shown above , spectroscopic results and emission line imaging do not provide enough contraints on the nebula density distribution .",
    "the density indicator generally used is the [ sii ] line intensity ratio .",
    "the density maps obtained from the [ s ii ] ratio ( see  [ sub - images ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - rsii - a ] for models b1 ( top panel ) and b2 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "as expected , the density gradient adopted for model b1 is clearly perceived .",
    "high resolution observation of pne emission lines often show double - peaked profiles , interpreted as the emission of a geometrically thin expanding shell .",
    "usually , the two peaks are not symmetric ( see gesicki et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 for seven pne , and @xcite for ngc3132 ) .",
    "if the asymmetry were due to local extinction , the blue peak should always be more intense than the red one . since this is not the case , another explanation for the asymmetry must be found .    in the following",
    ", the effect on the line profiles , due to geometry and orientation , will be discussed .",
    "we show that the asymmetry in the line profiles can be reproduced using a 3d photoionization code and the numerical tools described above (  2 ) . in order to illustrate these results ,",
    "one case is presented , using model a1 with a given velocity law .",
    "a linear law , as used by sahu & desai ( 1986 ) , is quite natural . in the following we adopted @xmath31 , with @xmath32 = 20 km / s and @xmath33 = 2.4@xmath3410@xmath35 cm ( maximum of the [ o  iii ] emissivity ) . the velocity profiles obtained after the rotation of the nebula by 50@xmath36 around the @xmath37-axis and projection along the @xmath5 axis",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - velo_a ] .",
    "each profile corresponds to a synthetic observation at a different position in the nebula .",
    "the assumed positions and aperture are shown in the upper panel , over the [ o iii ] image . a turbulent velocity of 2 km / s was taken into account .",
    "such value for the turbulent velocity is small , so that the adopted velocity field dominates the line profile .",
    "no convolution through an instrumental profile was applied .",
    "as seen in the figure , the profile changes from one region to another . depending on the position ,",
    "asymmetric profiles are obtained , including asymmetric double - peaked profiles . for positions at the right side of the nebula the double peaked profiles ,",
    "when asymmetric , show the blue peak more intense than the red one . on the other hand , due to the rotation around the @xmath37-axis , a red asymmetry ( not shown in the figure )",
    "would be obtained for positions on the left side of the image .",
    "the mean velocity ( as defined in  [ sub - stat ] ) of the [ o iii ] zone is @xmath38 = 22.1 km / s , which is comparable to what could be found from the peak separation on the profile corresponding to the synthetic observation of the central part of the nebula .    other velocity laws , suggested by hydrodynamic calculations , could be adopted when discussing observations from real objects .",
    "more accurate than line profiles observed at discrete positions , position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams ( also called echellograms ) provide an effective diagnostic for the geometry of pne . in the case of line tilts",
    "( guerrero et al . 1997 ) , pv - diagrams give constraints on the inclination of the pn ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observations and the 2d model of ngc 650 - 1 ( @xcite ) is another example of the use of pv - diagrams to deduce the geometrical properties of pne .",
    "such a model is not detailed enough to reproduce the differences between the observed emission of [ n ii]@xmath306584 and [ o iii]@xmath305007 .",
    "a 3d photoionization code is needed .",
    "pv - diagrams obtained from our model a1 rotated by 50@xmath36 around the @xmath37 axis and projected on the @xmath5 direction are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - ech_a ] .",
    "the upper - left panel shows the [ o iii]@xmath305007 image of the nebula .",
    "the upper - right and lower - left panels show pv - diagrams obtained through vertical and horizontal centered slits , respectively .",
    "the lower - right panel illustrates iso - velocity contours , for v = 9 km / s .",
    "the @xmath37-pv - diagram shows the signature of the tilt of the pn around the @xmath37-axis , while the absence of an asymmetry in the @xmath39-pv diagram indicates that the z axis of the nebula is perpendicular to the line of sight and coincides with the @xmath37-axis .",
    "such simulation is available from the 3d code for all the emission lines and is a very powerful tool to model high resolution observations like the ones from the taurus instrument ( walton et al .",
    "this paper illustrates the importance of 3d photoionization simulations when analyzing the various observational data currently obtained for pne . regarding the stellar temperature and luminosity , two different pne are simulated .",
    "for each one , two density distributions are assumed , in order to test the constraints on the nebula geometry provided by the data .",
    "for each kind of observation ( emission line spectroscopy , emission line imaging , emission line profiles ) the results obtained with the two different geometries are compared .",
    "regarding line emission from the whole nebula , the emission line ratios do not discriminate between the two possible density distributions since the two models have the same average density , giving similar [ s ii ] line intensity ratios .",
    "emission line imaging showing an ellipsoidal shape with an intensity enhancement on the minor axis is obtained with both density distributions .",
    "thus , this kind of observational data do not provide a method to distinguish between the two distributions .",
    "density maps , obtained from emission line ratios that are density indicators , can provide one of the keys to the geometry puzzle , as shown in ",
    "[ sub - dens - map ] .",
    "the other key , related to the orientation of the axis of symmetry of the nebula , comes from the emission line profiles observed in different locations of the nebula .",
    "an asymmetric double - peaked profile is usually observed in pne , but until now never theoretically reproduced by photoionization models .",
    "it can be generated assuming that the expansion velocity increases outward and that the axis of symmetry of the nebula makes an angle with the plane of the sky ( see  4 ) .",
    "the axis of symmetry tilt can also be visualized on the echelograms (  5 ) .",
    "notice that double - peaked profiles are also generated by pure hydrodynamic models ( mellema 1994 ) .    in brief , the different kinds of observations that are now available for planetary nebulae can only provide a complete insight of the object and its properties , if they are confronted with the results of photoionization simulations from a 3d code .",
