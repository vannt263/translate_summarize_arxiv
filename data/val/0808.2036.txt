    "testing for , and quantifying scaling is central to the application of statistical theories to ` real - world ' extended systems . a broad range of theoretical frameworks such as turbulence @xcite , critical phenomena @xcite and complex systems @xcite frame their predictions in terms of the statistical properties of ( arbitrarily large ) ensembles as a function of scale",
    ". under the assumption of ergodicity the statistical scaling property of an extended system",
    "is captured to some extent by a reduced ( embedded ) set of observations or measurements ; so that a 1-d cut through a @xmath0 dimensional system will be sufficient to indicate whether scaling is present , and in a quantitative way can usefully restrict the scaling exponents of the system as a whole .",
    "this approach is pragmatic  in physical systems it is generally not practicable to capture and analyze the full spatiotemporal information of all points in the system on all scales .",
    "a key observable is then the quantitative scaling properties of such a one dimensional sample or time series .",
    "an example of this is the use of the taylor hypothesis in turbulence , where the time series at a single point is used as a proxy for the statistical properties of the flow @xcite .",
    "time series are also often parsed into sub - intervals to isolate processes of interest , or to remove features which might contaminate the calculation of the quantity of interest .",
    "examples of this in the study of solar wind turbulence are the separating of fast and slow wind , and open / closed field line regions @xcite ; isolating or removing signals of interplanetary shocks , magnetosheath crossings , and coronal mass ejection remnants @xcite ; or where the interval is restricted by a secular change in parameters as the spacecraft changes location @xcite .",
    "examples in the study of the earth s geomagnetic field include isolating ` quasi - stationary ' and ` quiet ' intervals in magnetic field data @xcite ; and the effects of finite sample size in the power spectral exponent estimates in the ionosphere by ground - based measurements @xcite .",
    "` locally stationary processes ' are also discussed in speech signal analysis @xcite and physiological non - stationary signals @xcite ; and of course statistical forecasting , whether in the context of seasonal weather or the financial markets @xcite , is based on time series histories which rely on the stationarity assumption . in all of these cases , it is intuitively apparent that smaller data intervals will result in poorer statistics , which will be manifest in the variance of the observed values of the exponents .",
    "the observation of a ( non - secular ) variation in the scaling exponents therefore has two interpretations ; either it is due to intrinsic fluctuations as a result of the finite @xmath0 interval , or it is a consequence of non - time stationarity of the time series @xmath3 i.e. different scaling behaviour due to different physical phenomena .",
    "if the properties of the underlying process are not known _ a priori _ we need a method to distinguish these two interpretations in a quantitative manner ; or at best to put a degree of confidence that it is due to one and not the other .",
    "the most commonly used tool to both establish and quantify scaling in a time series @xmath3 is to test for scaling of the power spectral density @xmath4 , and obtain the exponent @xmath5 . in a physical system , such scaling can only be observed over a finite range , limited by the interval ( in time @xmath6 ) of @xmath0 observations over which the system is measured . from large - sample theory ( asymptotic limit of @xmath7 )",
    "the variance in the power spectral exponent @xmath5 computed using least squares regression from an interval of @xmath0 samples is known @xcite for finite variance processes to vary as @xmath1 as @xmath2 .",
    "one method to obtain more complete information about the scaling properties of a stochastic process @xmath3 is captured by how the statistical properties of the increments @xmath8 vary with the differencing scale @xmath9 ; the differencing being a particular type of coarse - graining operation which has been chosen due to the easy analogy with random walks , return probabilities etc .",
    "however , there exist other coarse - graining operations which although more involved , possess additional highly desirable properties when studying scaling .",
    "in particular , wavelets which ( with some wavelet functions ) when combined with their detrending capabilities have been shown to be a natural and computationally efficient way of studying scale - by - scale statistical behaviour @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will discuss the behaviour of the scaling properties of the second order moment @xmath10 .",
    "we may anticipate that the statistical properties of this scaling exponent @xmath11 follow that of @xmath5 ; indeed there exist many results for a range of different estimators of the @xmath11 @xcite that directly show the asymptotic @xmath1 behaviour discussed above . in practice ,",
    "the convergence to this @xmath1 behaviour will depend on the details of the process and the estimator and , as we shall show in this paper , is often slow .",
    "an essential tool in the analysis of ` real world ' time series in the context of scaling is then a prescription for the variance in the scaling exponents of @xmath3 as a function of the number of observations @xmath0 in the chosen interval . in this paper",
    "we make some first steps in this direction by obtaining empirical estimates from the study of a variety of stochastic processes that have been used as models for physical systems .",
    "we focus on finite size @xmath0 realizations of self - affine cases with gaussian distributed increments in the form of a standard brownian motion and fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) ; and those with heavy tails , namely @xmath12-stable lvy motion and linear fractional stable motion ( lfsm ) @xcite . a representative case for multifractal scaling",
    "is provided by the @xmath13-model , often used to characterize observations of turbulence @xcite .",
    "the fundamental property of ergodicity in systems that exhibit scaling implies time stationarity . in its strong sense time stationarity implies that the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath3 does not change with time ; this is known as strict stationarity .",
    "pragmatically , weak stationarity , that is time independence of the variance or second order moment is usually adopted  the latter convenience is usually assumed due to the special place that the central limit theorem and the gaussian distribution hold in statistics . in this paper",
    "we are concerned specifically with the behaviour of scaling exponents which are characterized through the statistical properties of the increments @xmath14 , rather than the time series @xmath3 ; hence we will use as our test time series examples that have stationarity in @xmath14 , and not in @xmath3 .",
    "we will focus on the statistics of the scaling exponent of the second order moment of the increments , as this also captures the power spectral exponent @xmath5 , and for self - affine finite - variance processes the hurst exponent @xmath15 ( see next section and also @xcite for the infinite variance case ) .",
    "we will study these processes for a range of values of @xmath0 that are feasable for realisable physical systems ; and find that in particularly for the heavy - tailed processes , the variance in the exponent with @xmath0 shows a significant departure from the @xmath16 asymptotic behaviour .",
    "nevertheless , for these heavy - tailed processes , we find empirical evidence of an intermediate range of scaling with @xmath17 .",
    "we will estimate the time series interval @xmath0 required to capture the scaling exponent to reasonable precision ; this places a lower limit on the sample size . a related study to this",
    "was conducted to investigate and compare the effects of finite sample size on different statistical estimators for the hurst exponent @xmath15 for a gaussian white noise process @xcite .",
    "stationarity also implies a particular pdf of the values of the exponent obtained from many , length @xmath0 , realisations of a given process .",
    "this is known asymptotically for @xmath7 for the processes based on gaussian increments ( generalizable to finite variance processes ) and is also known in this asymptotic sense for infinite variance processes ; both processes approaching a gaussian distribution for the scaling exponents as @xmath7 @xcite ( using least squares and maximum likelihood estimation schemes ) . for the intermediate stage of finite @xmath0",
    "we find intermediate distributions for the exponents ; resembling both the asymptotic gaussian forms and , for heavy - tailed data , gumbel max - stable ( extreme value type i ) distributions .",
    "comparing these results with that found for real - world time series may provide an additional test for stationarity in the increments . in this spirit",
    "we finally illustrate these ideas with some examples of real - world time series in the form of _ in - situ _ observations of magnetic field and velocity in the turbulent solar wind using data from spacecraft at 1au in the ecliptic ; and comment on the statistical properties of their scaling exponents in light of the representative synthetic toy models .",
    "we will focus attention on the scaling exponent @xmath11 of the second order moment of the increments also known as the second order structure function : @xmath18 where we have assumed that the increment process is at least second order stationary i.e. @xmath19 ( weak - stationarity ) .",
    "in particular , this implies that the power spectral density of a discrete time random walk @xmath3 of _ i.i.d . _ stationary increments with finite variance , scales as @xcite @xmath20 where the scaling exponent @xmath11 is related to the power spectral exponent @xmath5 of @xmath3 by @xmath21 . for self - affine process with hurst exponent @xmath15",
    "the pdf @xmath22 of the increments obeys the scaling relation ( for the case of @xmath12-stable processes with finite @xmath0 see @xcite , and the discussion to follow ) @xmath23 where the pdf @xmath24 at any scale @xmath9 can be collapsed onto a unique scaling function @xmath25 .",
    "the scaling relation ( [ eq:1 ] ) implies that the scaling of the structure functions to all orders @xmath13 @xcite is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 ; and thus we have that @xmath28 . our results concerning the statistical behaviour of @xmath11 with @xmath0 will thus also apply to the power spectral exponent @xmath5 for all the models concerned and the hurst exponent @xmath15 for the self - affine models ; both are commonly used to characterize statistical scaling .",
    "our remarks can also be generalized to the scaling exponents @xmath29 of structure functions of higher - order positive moments .",
    "these are relevant for multifractal processes where the @xmath29 are a nonlinear function of @xmath13 and so @xmath15 or @xmath5 are not sufficient to determine the complete statistical scaling of the @xmath14 .",
    "our study consists of partitioning a given time series @xmath3 into @xmath30 equal intervals of sample size @xmath0 denoted by @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "each of these intervals are then differenced on scale @xmath9 to produce a time series of the increments @xmath33 of the process @xmath31 .",
    "we will look for scaling of the second order moment ( structure function ) @xmath34 with @xmath9 such that @xmath35 .",
    "again , the index @xmath36 indicates the @xmath37 interval over which the exponents are calculated and tracks any ( real or statistical ) time variation in the value of @xmath38 . in an infinitely large interval , @xmath39 , the limits of the integral @xmath40 ; here however each @xmath37 interval of the time series will impose different finite extremal values @xmath41 . for the heavy - tailed processes in particular ,",
    "the statistics of the @xmath41 can be anticipated to have a significant effect on the statistics of the @xmath38 ; this has been discussed for the case of @xmath12- stable lvy processes in @xcite .",
    "these lvy processes , possess heavy tails in the pdfs of their increments , with tails that fall as @xmath42 power - laws .",
    "the @xmath12-stable lvy processes have divergent moments for @xmath43 and above ; for a finite sized sample the moments exist but can be dominated by the behaviour of rare outlying points in the tails which introduce a pathological bias when estimating scaling exponents from the moments @xcite ( for a wider discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "we circumvent these difficulties , at least for self - affine time series , by restricting our analysis to the scaling of the second order moment @xmath11 , and by using the iterative conditioning technique @xcite .",
    "this simple and robust technique for exponent estimation removes a small percentage of the extreme data values which are poorly sampled statistically . in some pathological cases such as the @xmath12-stable lvy distributions",
    "these rare extreme points are of the order of and sometimes larger than the whole sum @xcite . because they are so large they tend to dominate the statistics and thus the scaling of the higher order moments .",
    "this can be clearly seen if we look at the discrete definition of the moments of order @xmath13 @xmath44 the reasoning and full illustration of this iterative conditioning method to heavy - tailed non - gaussian distributions is discussed in @xcite .",
    "although not discussed in this paper , the iterative conditioning technique is also an unbiased robust technique for distinguishing self - affine ( monofractal ) from multifractal behaviour .",
    "we will focus here on parameter stationarity as opposed to trend stationarity .",
    "the former refers to the change in the intrinsic dynamics of the process of interest as characterized by its quantitative statistical properties ( the behaviour of the moments ) ; as opposed to the latter which is simply an additive trend to the signal .",
    "in particular we will focus on the stationarity of the scaling of the moments as captured by the exponents @xmath45 .",
    "if secular trends are present in the time series then the time series of increments will be approximately trend - free provided our differencing scale @xmath9 is sufficiently small @xcite .",
    "a secular trend can also be removed by detrending or by the method of studying the scaling of moments of wavelet coefficients where an appropriate wavelet is chosen with a large number of zero - moments @xcite .",
    "the more complex case of mixed dynamics i.e. two or more intrinsically different processes represented in different sections of a time series will not be considered here .",
    "we will consider synthetically generated signals that are both stationary and nonstationary with respect to their increments .",
    "the signals with stationary independent increments will consist of a standard brownian motion and standard symmetric @xmath12-stable lvy motion for four values of the exponent @xmath12 @xcite ; the latter being highly non - gaussian and heavy - tailed with very large excursions in their time series . to survey a broad range of such processes we have also included non - markovian versions of the above processes .",
    "these include a long - memory fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) , and a long - memory persistent and anti - persistent linear fractional stable motion ( lfsm ) ",
    "see @xcite for more details on these processes and in particular @xcite for the algorithm and matlab code for the lfsm .",
    "we also investigate a multifractal time series generated from a discrete multiplicative cascade process in the form of the @xmath13-model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13-model is used as a model for intermittent turbulence @xcite .",
    "the intermittency of the @xmath13-model time series leads to non - time stationary finite @xmath0 moments ; however the set of scaling exponents @xmath45 are stationary .    the nonstationary time series we will consider are a standard brownian motion with linearly varying standard deviation of its increments with time @xmath46 , and cyclically varying standard deviation ( cyclically stationary ) @xmath47 .",
    "all of the above synthetic time series were generated in matlab with appropriate random seeding and sample sizes of @xmath48 .",
    "lastly , we will consider three real - world time series which have been found to exhibit scaling @xcite .",
    "these consist of two time series of 100 second resolution magnetic field @xmath49 and speed @xmath50 from the nasa wind spacecraft at 1au in the solar minimum year 1996 ; and a 64 second resolution one year long time series of the magnetic field energy density @xmath51 from the nasa ace spacecraft in the solar maximum year 2000 .",
    "all of these time series consist of @xmath52 data samples and can be downloaded from cda web http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/.",
    "we study the variation of the scaling exponent of the second order moment @xmath38 with sample size @xmath0 .",
    "the process by which the exponent @xmath38 is estimated for @xmath30 contiguous intervals of @xmath0 points of a time series is illustrated in figure [ fig:1 ] for the @xmath13-model .",
    "we begin with the time series in figure [ fig:1](a ) which we parse into @xmath30 intervals . for each of these intervals",
    "we obtain an estimate of @xmath38 as the gradient of a linear least squares regression to a log - log plot of the second - order moment @xmath53 versus the scale or differencing parameter @xmath9 .",
    "this method of obtaining the scaling exponents is also known as the structure function technique @xcite and is closely related to variance plot , correlogram and log - periodogram techniques @xcite  in the latter reference @xcite it is identical to the variogram technique .",
    "we focus on this particular method to estimate @xmath38 as it provides a point of contact with asymptotic @xmath2 estimates of the variance of the power spectral exponent @xmath5 which are based on linear regression over a finite range power law power spectrum @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the variance in the estimated exponent will depend upon the details of the linear regression .",
    "for the second order moment these details include the range of values of @xmath9 over which @xmath53 is a power law ; the number of different @xmath9 for which we calculate @xmath53 and use in the linear regression ; and the uncertainty of each @xmath53 value . in all cases considered here",
    "we optimize these details to minimize the linear regression error but importantly use the same algorithm for all of the sample time series that we discuss .",
    "the linear fit is obtained by linear least - squares regression which also provides an estimate of the error .",
    "we augment this estimate of the error by varying the start and end points of the regression by a few points and obtaining the difference in the exponents .",
    "the linear regression was done over @xmath54 values of the scale parameter @xmath9 , where @xmath9 was increased geometrically as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 was chosen to be @xmath58 .",
    "the fit was done over this reduced set of measurements at @xmath54 values of @xmath9 so that a fair comparison can be made with the real - world data ( to be discussed later ) where only a limited power - law range is seen .",

    "series shown here , the second order moment follows the local amplitude of fluctuations in the time series itself ; comparing the ratio of the amplitude of these fluctuations to the signal amplitude is one of the classical ` first base ' techniques for establishing whether the signal is stationary ( in the weak sense)@xcite . as one would expect from ( [ eq:5pt5 ] ) , this variation of the second - order moment @xmath53 with the amplitude of the time series is emphasized as we decrease @xmath0 as any estimates of the statistics from smaller sample size will naturally mimic the more local features of the time series .",
    "this behaviour is more pronounced in very intermittent signals i.e. those with heavy - tailed fluctuation pdfs .",
    "we also plot in figures [ fig:1](c ) and ( d ) the corresponding estimates of @xmath65 for each interval .",
    "these two panels show the same data , that is , the estimates of @xmath65 plotted without ( c ) and with ( d ) error bars obtained from the linear regression and the error augmentation outlined above .",
    "as intuitively expected , if we decrease the sample size @xmath0 over which the @xmath65 are computed , the scatter increases .",
    "however unlike the moments , there is no clear trend with the amplitude of the signal , indicating stationarity of the scaling exponent @xmath65 .",
    "this latter phenomenon will also be encountered in the non - stationary brownian time series we will study .",
    "the estimates of @xmath65 can be seen to vary by up to a factor of two for @xmath66 for this realization of the @xmath13-model .",
    "this underlies the difficulty of obtaining physically meaningful estimates of scaling exponents for physically realizable @xmath0 .",
    "we can see that the error bars approximately capture the fluctuations in the estimates of @xmath65 for the case of the @xmath13-model .",
    "as we wish to include strongly non - gaussian processes in our study , we will henceforth present numerical estimates of the variance of @xmath65 obtained directly from computing many values of @xmath65 rather than the linear regression error .",

    "the essential point is that quite significant variation in the scaling exponents can arise in time stationary , but intermittent , time series ; even when these are estimated over intervals of data that might intuitively be considered to be of adequate length . in order to distinguish variation in the scaling exponents that is statistical ( finite @xmath0 effect ) as shown above , from that which",
    "reflects intrinsic non - time stationarity , some estimate of the @xmath0 dependence of the variance of @xmath11 is needed ; this will also point to an estimate of the minimum number of observations @xmath0 needed to obtain a ` reasonably accurate ' estimate of @xmath11 .",
    "we will now explore the variance of @xmath11 as a function of @xmath0 .    in the limit @xmath39 , @xmath5 , when estimated via a log - periodogram varies as @xmath68 \\sim 1/n$ ] @xcite .",
    "this limiting behaviour is also known for some other estimation schemes of the self - similarity parameter @xcite ( as we discuss later here ) .",
    "thus we would anticipate that for sufficiently large @xmath0 , @xmath69 \\sim 1/n$ ] for our moment scaling estimation also .",
    "however , we do not know the rate of convergence with @xmath0 to this limiting behaviour and can also anticipate that this will depend upon whether the pdf of the increments is heavy - tailed , and whether or not the increments are dependent  both of which introduce further difficulties in obtaining an unbiased estimator .",

    "processes that show scaling often have increments drawn from a heavy tailed pdf , these may also not intrinsically have finite variance as is the case for the @xmath12-stable lvy processes .",
    "figure [ fig:2](b ) shows the @xmath0 dependence of all the infinite variance synthetic time series that we have considered , including those with long - range memory .",
    "the curves are all generated from time series which possess heavy - tailed pdfs for their increments .",
    "these include both the ordinary and fractional lvy increments .",
    "the curves in figure [ fig:2](b ) have a range of @xmath82 values close to but also clearly distinct from @xmath83 . as will be discussed later",
    "this is due to slow convergence to the asymptotic @xmath84 behaviour ; from figure [ fig:2](b ) we can see that the lvy process which is closest to gaussian , namely with @xmath85 , has behaviour closest to @xmath71 . in a similar way to the method used above for the finite variance synthetic processes , we make empirical estimates of @xmath72 required to obtain an estimate of @xmath11 to within @xmath86 for the infinite variance processes . for",

    "the relevant property in the context of estimating the uncertainty on @xmath65 is that for realizable @xmath0 , these processes do not show an @xmath84 dependence .",
    "also , unlike the gaussian processes in figure [ fig:2](a ) which cluster around a similar @xmath81 value , the infinite variance processes have noticeably different values of @xmath81 which depends on both the the tail exponent @xmath12 and also on the degree of memory in the process given by @xmath92 @xcite .    finally , combining equations ( [ eq:8 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) we obtain @xmath93 where both @xmath81 and @xmath82 depend on the process in question ; and for finite variance processes @xmath83 .          to estimate the errors in the estimates of @xmath67 a small monte - carlo type study was performed in which different random seeds were used to generate 10 different realisations of the two archetypal processes studied here i.e. finite and infinite variance processes in the form of 10 different realisations of a standard brownian motion and a standard @xmath12-stable lvy process ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the computation of the @xmath94 vs. @xmath95 plots were then calculated for each of these realisations ; these are shown in figures [ fig:3](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we then average over these realisations to obtain an average value of @xmath67 for each @xmath0 , shown on log - log axes in figures [ fig:3](c ) and ( d ) ; the ensemble of realisations also provides an error on this value via the maximum deviation from this average .    at large @xmath0 errors",
    "are dominated by there being fewer values of computed @xmath65 and at small @xmath0 , by poor resolution of the pdf from which we ultimately compute @xmath65 . in particular , at small @xmath0",
    "we can see from the plots for the @xmath12-stable processes that there is a systematic deviation from power law behaviour in @xmath0 .",
    "this arises from a breakdown in the iterative conditioning technique @xcite at small @xmath0 .    in the next section",

    "we should mention the use of bootstrap re - sampling methods for providing distributions , confidence intervals and statistical significance for parameter estimates in situations when one is limited by a single realisation @xcite .",
    "although the convergence and consistent properties of such techniques in the case of heavy - tailed distributions @xcite and especially infinite - variance processes are still unclear we envisage the use of such methods in future research .",
    "finally , one could in principle increase the available number of values of @xmath65 by overlapping intervals of size @xmath0 within a given single realisation .",

    "the wind data illustrates the effect of large data gaps which are not present in the ace data shown ; this limits the amount of data available for certain @xmath0 which is reflected in the corresponding estimations of @xmath77 $ ] . for the ace @xmath96 data we can see a clear systematic departure from the synthetic models",
    ". we will discuss this latter data set in the next section below .",
    "the problem with a single length @xmath0 realisation is that we can not calculate the errors on @xmath77 $ ] as done in the previous section ; and thus have no way of gauging how close these graphs are to the expected asymptotic behaviour predicted by large - sample theory .",
    "however , one can still estimate an error for measurements of @xmath11 obtained from a finite data size @xmath0 , in the same way as was done in equations ( [ eq:6])-([eq:9 ] ) .",
    "for example , in the case of the ace @xmath96 data this would indicate that a @xmath97 sample size would introduce an error of @xmath98 in the estimated values of @xmath11 using the iteratively conditioned moment scaling technique .",

    "the dashed line on both of these plots indicates a negative slope of unit gradient .",
    "also included for comparison are the archetypal synthetic data sets for the finite variance and infinite variance processes . ]",
    "we plot in figure [ fig:5 ] the pdfs @xmath99 for three of the representative models we have studied along with the pdfs @xmath99 for one of the real - world data sets . for each of these time series , pdfs",

    "interested readers can find more on the mathematical details and proofs in @xcite which deal with spectral parameter estimates of strong long - range dependent gaussian stationary time series ; @xcite for a non - stationary generalization of these ; @xcite for a pseudo - variogram estimator ( similar to the method in this paper ) to long - range dependent gaussian processes with stationary increments ; and the more recent and extensive paper by stoev , pipiras and taqqu @xcite which extends the proofs and arguments of @xcite to infinite variance processes in the form of @xmath12-stable and linear fractional stable processes .",
    "this latter reference will be our main source and point of contact for what follows .",
    "a survey of many of these papers and parameter estimation techniques can be found in @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , we have chosen stoev _",
    "@xcite as a point of contact from amongst the extensive literature concerning asymptotic large sample behaviour of parameter estimates .",
    "this is primarily because this work has dealt with infinite variance processes of the type discussed here ; also our moment scaling technique is a particular form of one of the main estimators used in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we have also used stoev s matlab algorithm for generating the lfsm realisations used in this paper .",
    "similar to our study stoev _ et .",
    "_ use a least squares regression on the moments which they refer to as the ` power ' estimator .",
    "however , instead of taking moments of the increments as we do , they take the moments of coefficients for a finite impulse response transformation ( firt ) of the discrete time - series , which is characterised by a discrete filter of @xmath100 members .",
    "our increments are one of the simplest forms of these firt coefficients if we take the filter to be comprised of a set of @xmath101 members @xmath102 .",
    "however , any extra benefits of having more than one zero - moment ( moments which are equal to zero ) will be lost due to this simplicity .",
    "this also applies to the wavelet coefficients used in the study of stoev _ et .",
    "_ where our increments result from taking the mother wavelet to be the superposition of two delta functions ( one positive , one negative ) separated by a scale @xmath9  also known in the literature as the ` poor man s wavelet ' @xcite .",
    "also , an important fact to note when comparing the methods of stoev _ et .",
    "_ to ours is that we differ with the ` power ' method of these authors by using the iterative conditioning technique which by censoring and excluding the poorly sampled large extreme events , correct for the bias which is pathological in the case of heavy - tailed distributions @xcite .",
    "recall that the second order moment is scaling as @xmath103 and we will be estimating @xmath11 from the gradient of a log - log plot @xmath104 for the discrete data the gradient can be estimated via least squares linear regression , and the problem can be set out as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the vector of the observations ( or dependent variables ) ; @xmath107 contains the vector of the scales ( or independent variables ) ; @xmath108 is the vector of the parameters needed to be estimated ; and @xmath109 is the vector of estimation errors between the sample measurements and those of the true expected values ( denoted by @xmath110 ) for which the scaling relation in ( [ eq:10 ] ) actually holds .",
    "the solution to equation ( [ eq:11 ] ) is then given by the well known ordinary linear least squares estimator to the parameters as @xmath111 where superscript @xmath6 represents a matrix transpose .",
    "( [ eq:15pt5 ] ) is simply a linear combination of the dependent variable @xmath112 i.e. a sum , so that for @xmath65 one can write the ordinary least squares estimate as @xmath113 where the @xmath114 are all the elements of the appropriate vector from @xmath115 .",
    "we will return to this form of the ordinary least squares solution shortly .    adapted to the notation used in this paper , theorem 3.1 in @xcite states that if @xmath11 is the firt coefficient estimator ( using least squares regression ) for the scaling exponent and @xmath116 the true expected value ; then as @xmath117 @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a normal distribution with mean @xmath120 and variance @xmath121 . strictly speaking this theorem",
    "requires that the firt coefficients obey the following inequality between the number of zero - moments of the firt filter , the self - similarity parameter @xmath15 and the tail ( stability ) index @xmath12 @xmath122 which in the case of the ordinary brownian motion and the @xmath12-stable lvy processes , where @xmath123 , generalises to @xmath124 the moment scaling scheme based on the raw increments has only one zero moment , hence @xmath125 ; and as a result , except for the @xmath13-model for which @xmath12 and @xmath15 are unknown ( or not applicable ) , the above inequality does not hold for any of the synthetic models . however as mentioned in @xcite for gaussian processes , where in equation ( [ eq:17 ] ) @xmath126 ,",
    "the @xmath125 case is sufficient for the above theorem to hold as long as @xmath127 . for our fbm model @xmath128 and we find that the results of the theorem ( [ eq:16 ] ) still hold .",
    "thus we can conjecture that the criterion in ( [ eq:17 ] ) and ( [ eq:18 ] ) can be relaxed a little so that the inequality becomes an approximate inequality .",
    "also , stoev _ et .",
    "_ @xcite show via simulations that the estimators continue to work well even when the criterion in ( [ eq:17 ] ) and ( [ eq:18 ] ) are not satisfied .",
    "the essential reason why this criteria was initially introduced , was so that the estimator could distinguish between actual long - memory effects and trends @xcite .",
    "we now consider the exception that we have found to this behaviour  that of the infinite variance processes at finite @xmath0 .",
    "we would expect that in the @xmath2 limit the results of the above theorem will also hold for the infinite variance processes .",
    "however , we believe that in this case the convergence will be slow and will depend upon the number of scales @xmath9 that were used to conduct our linear least squares regression",
    ".    we will now go beyond the above asymptotic arguments to discuss the non - gaussian intermediate finite @xmath0 behaviour that we see here in figure [ fig:5 ] ( b - i ) and ( b - ii ) .",
    "recall the expression for @xmath53 given in equation ( [ eq:5pt5 ] ) ( for @xmath43 ) .",
    "we will discuss in detail here the case where the sum in ( [ eq:5pt5 ] ) consists of _ i.i.d .",
    "_ random variables ; this is the case for some of our synthetic time series  these arguments can be developed for other cases .",
    "the pdf of this sum will by the central limit theorem tend to a gaussian and for finite @xmath0 will probably take the form of a pearson @xmath129 type variable with @xmath130 degrees of freedom ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "however , for an infinite variance process , the sum in ( [ eq:5pt5 ] ) will be dominated by the largest extreme events , which in some cases can be of the order of the rest of the sum @xcite",
    ". this will still be the case even when we have excluded some of these extreme events due to the iterative conditioning scheme .",
    "thus the sum will be distributed as the extreme values of an @xmath12-stable lvy distribution  which is given by a max - stable frecht distribution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that this will be the case for any @xmath0 , even in the asymptotic large @xmath0 case . without too much detail",
    "the form of the pdf @xmath131 of @xmath132 will be of the type @xmath133 where any scale parameters have been absorbed into the @xmath134 .",
    "one can then convert this frecht pdf to a pdf @xmath135 corresponding to the dependent variable @xmath112 in the least squares scheme in ( [ eq:15pt75 ] ) , which under a simple conservation of probability will be given by @xmath136 which is in the form of a gumbel extreme value distribution ; this is another max - stable distribution @xcite .",
    "the gumbel max - stable pdf has a long slow exponentially decreasing right tail ; this will imply that a sum of random variables such as ( [ eq:15pt75 ] ) , each distributed with this pdf , will eventually tend to a gaussian distributed random variable , but slowly due to the heavy right tail .",
    "this then captures our result in figures [ fig:5 ] ( b - i ) and ( b - ii ) , and may also explain why we do not obtain the @xmath137 behaviour in the plots of @xmath94 vs. @xmath95 for the @xmath12-stable lvy cases .    as discussed above , for the case of the finite variance synthetic time series the @xmath138",
    "will be well described by a gaussian or ( more realistically for finite @xmath0 ) a pearson @xmath139 pdf . in the same way",
    "as was done with the infinite variance processes above , it can be shown that the pdf of @xmath140 can be written as a gumbel min - stable pdf .",
    "gumbel min - stable pdf s have long slow exponentially decreasing left tails , which in our case will be limited by the fact that @xmath141 .",
    "the right tail of gumbel min - stable pdfs is more compact with a rapidly decaying exponential tail . due to the more compact nature of the pdf",
    ", a sum of @xmath140 variables will tend to a gaussian under the central limit theorem much faster than the infinite variance processes above , hence explaining why the pdfs @xmath99 for the finite variance processes are well described by a gaussian .",
    "finally , there is the open question of the behaviour of the real - world data .",
    "the ace @xmath96 data pdfs of @xmath99 show that they can be well described by a gaussian ; however the scaling of @xmath67 with @xmath0 using our estimation shows a significant deviation from the @xmath84 behaviour implied by ( [ eq:16 ] )",
    ". this will be the topic of future work .",
    "we have investigated finite - sample size ( @xmath0 ) effects on quantifying the statistical scaling properties of time series .",
    "we focus on the scaling exponent @xmath11 of the variance or second moment which for a wide class of processes also gives the spectral exponent @xmath5 of the ( power law ) power spectrum .",
    "if too small a sample size is used then these fluctuations effectively introduce a pseudo - nonstationarity in the estimates for the scaling exponents . to achieve an error in the exponent of less than @xmath86",
    ", we find that the number of data points @xmath0 needed varies significantly with the details of the underlying process and is in the range of @xmath142 for the synthetic models used in this paper .",
    "the variance in the exponent when computed from an interval of @xmath0 samples is known to vary as @xmath1 for @xmath2 ; however , the convergence to this behaviour will also depend on the details of the process and more importantly on the parameter estimating technique used .",
    "in particular we have shown that heavy tailed processes can be far from this limiting behaviour for observationally realisable @xmath0 .",
    "we have also considered the case where the scaling exponents are time independent , but where there is a secular time dependence in other parameters such as the standard deviation . for the case of a brownian motion ,",
    "the estimate of the scaling exponent is not affected by this time dependence .",
    "it may thus be too premature to reject a time series for scaling analysis simply because of the non - stationarity of certain parameters i.e. a running mean or standard deviation .",
    "this also highlights the need to distinguish time variation in the moments from that in scaling exponents that are derived from them .",
    "we have focussed here on the moment order scaling technique to calculate the scaling exponents in order to highlight the issue of apparent non - time stationarity .",
    "although there exists extensive statistics literature on the asymptotic @xmath7 limit of various estimation techniques , further work is needed to investigate how these details pass over to the more pressing and pragmatic need for their implications on quantifying scaling in finite and realisable @xmath0-sized samples .",
