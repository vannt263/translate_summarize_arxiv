    "the theoretical discovery@xcite of 3d topological insulators ( tis ) in 2006 precipitated an avalanche of experiments aimed at detecting the signature behavior of these unconventional solids . since then",
    ", angle - resolved photoemission spectra@xcite have given evidence for the dirac - like dispersion and the momentum - dependent spin texture of ti surface states , whereas local stm probes have indicated a characteristic suppression of backscattering off surface imperfections.@xcite however , the most desired observation of a hallmark dc conduction confined to the surface layer of a 3d ti remains elusive.@xcite the main problem is conduction through the bulk : 3d tis are narrow - gap semiconductors , rich in bulk carriers that are either thermally activated and/or donated by crystalline lattice imperfections . along with attempts to reduce bulk charge carriers , experimentalists are developing techniques which allow to register a separate conduction channel on the surface of a 3d ti.@xcite chief among these are measurements of low - field magnetoresistance combined with electrostatic gating of thin - film samples.@xcite    low - field magnetoresistance measurements unveil the interference correction @xmath0 to the drude conductivity @xmath1.@xcite at low temperatures , @xmath1 is defined by independent acts of scattering of electrons off the crystal s imperfections , and is proportional to the classical diffusion constant @xmath2 . when the phase relaxation length @xmath3 is parametrically longer than the scattering mean free path , quantum interference affects the conductivity to a measurable extent .",
    "the sign of the interference correction depends on the strength of spin - orbit interactions . for weak spin - orbit interactions ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the spin - orbit scattering length )",
    ", it follows that @xmath6 .",
    "this is called weak localization ( wl ) .",
    "in contrast , strong spin - orbit interaction ( @xmath7 ) leads to suppression of backscattering and thus @xmath8 .",
    "this is called weak antilocalization ( wal ) .",
    "being interference effects , wl and wal are degraded by a magnetic field @xmath9 when @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the flux quantum .",
    "yet , @xmath1 is nearly immune to @xmath9 at such low fields . therefore , the low - field magnetoconductivity reads @xmath12 .",
    "all experiments to date report wal in 3d ti thin films,@xcite and ascribe it to the strong spin - orbit interaction in the electronic bands of these materials . for film thickness",
    "less than @xmath3 , the measured @xmath13 agrees well with the functional form provided by 2d wal theory , namely @xmath14 where @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the digamma function and a number,@xcite respectively . in a system with a single conduction channel",
    ", @xmath17 is universal and equals @xmath18 .",
    "the wal contributions add for systems which are isolated from each other .",
    "for example , having two independent parallel conduction channels yields @xmath19 , irrespective of the ratio of drude conductivities of the two subsystems .",
    "the relation between @xmath17 and the number of parallel channels is at the heart of recent magnetoresistance experiments in 3d tis.@xcite overall , the coefficient @xmath17 is found to depend on the gate voltage .",
    "for some devices,@xcite it changes from @xmath20 all the way to @xmath19 .",
    "a plausible interpretation for this variation is presented in ref .",
    "[ ] . at zero or positive bias applied to the top gate , electrons from the @xmath21-doped bulk reach the surface states easily : the entire film acts as a single electron system , and @xmath20 . at negative bias",
    ", electrons are repeled from the top surface and , for strong enough bias , a depletion layer is formed adjacent to it .",
    "this depletion region separates the film into two subsystems : bulk carriers ( combined with surface carriers from the bottom surface ) on one side , and top - surface carriers on the other side . for a wide enough depletion layer , @xmath19 .    in spite of the ongoing scrutiny on the experimental front , quantum corrections to conductivity in 3d tis",
    "have stimulated relatively little theoretical activity .",
    "even though the wal contribution from ti surface states has been calculated explicitly,@xcite there are no calculations that incorporate conducting 3d bulk states .",
    "the main reason for this omission may be the prevailing view that quantum corrections originating from bulk ti states ought to be conceptually identical to those in ordinary strongly spin - orbit coupled systems , i.e. of wal type . recently , an objection to this viewpoint has been raised,@xcite declaring that quantum well states in ultrathin ti films may contribute via wl rather than wal .",
    "although suggestive , the calculation of ref .",
    "[ ] is limited to quasi-2d films and disregards the coupling between bulk and surface states , which leaves out several experiments of interest .",
    "besides , its extrapolation to 3d bulk states has not been carried out properly .    in this paper",
    "we evaluate @xmath22 for gated 3d thin films , as a function of the bulk carrier concentration and accounting for the coupling between surface and bulk states .",
    "our calculation applies to ti films that are thicker than the bulk mean free path , thinner than @xmath3 , and not highly doped . in these films ,",
    "bulk carriers are three - dimensional and are concentrated around the @xmath23 point of the electronic band structure .",
    "the resulting approximate analytical expressions for @xmath22 ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : magres_bulk ] ) ,  ( [ eq : res_tot ] ) and ( [ eq : res_tot5 ] ) ) are aimed at improving the interpretation of magnetoresistance measurements in tis , in weyl semimetals,@xcite and in some class of topologically trivial materials .",
    "although a few of our observations resemble those developed for graphene@xcite and 2d tis,@xcite there are qualitative differences originating from the 3d dirac nature of bulk carriers in 3d tis .",
    "altogether , the results reported here paint a richer picture than previously anticipated . on one hand",
    ", we confirm the conventional crossover between @xmath20 and @xmath19 as a function of the gate voltage : the former corresponds to the case of coherently - coupled bulk and surface electron states , while the latter indicates a single decoupled dirac cone on the top surface along with generic wal from the rest of the film ( containing coupled bulk and bottom surface ) . on the other hand ,",
    "less conventional results arise when the fermi energy is close to the bulk band edge or when the fermi energy is much larger than the bulk bandgap : in the former regime the bulk exhibits wl with @xmath24 , whereas in the latter regime the bulk exhibits an anomalous wal with @xmath19 .",
    "these two `` unusual '' bulk regimes , combined with the surface contributions , may result in a range of @xmath17 including @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we evaluate quantum corrections to _ bulk _ conductivity .",
    "readers not interested in technical details should read subsection iia and quickly scan through iib and iic in order to get acquainted with the nomenclature ; the main results of the section are collected in section iid .",
    "the well - known message from iia is that at low energies bulk electrons of ti films behave as massive 3d dirac fermions with spin and valley ( or orbital ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the direction of spin is locked with that of momentum , and valleys are coupled to one another by the mass of the dirac fermions .",
    "the special case in which the dirac mass vanishes is a time- and inversion - symmetric weyl semimetal .    in section",
    "iid we identify and count the number of `` soft '' cooperon modes , which determine the magnitude and sign of @xmath22 in the bulk . each soft cooperon obeys a classical difussion equation and is thus associated with a conserved physical quantity . since charge is conserved , there is at least one soft cooperon in ( non - magnetic ) bulk tis .",
    "we find that additional soft cooperons can emerge depending on the bulk doping concentration as well as the bulk bandgap .",
    "this realization leads to the most important results in iid , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : res_bulk])-([eq : magres_bulk ] ) , which indicate that for bulk states @xmath17 may acquire three different universal values . on one hand , wl with @xmath24 is possible when the bulk fermi surface is `` small '' ( as defined in the text ) , because in this case the spin - momentum locking of bulk states becomes weak and the spin of electrons is nearly conserved .",
    "in contrast , wal with @xmath19 can arise for bulk tis with particularly small bandgaps , because in such case bulk electrons can be described by a 3d analogue of graphene with two nearly decoupled valleys , each contributing @xmath18 to @xmath17 . for a more generic case , in which neither valley nor spin are approximately conserved ,",
    "the quantum interference is similar to that of an ordinary film with strong spin - orbit coupling and therefore @xmath20 .",
    "magnetic fields perpendicular to the ti film can be used to induce crossovers between different universal regimes of @xmath17 .",
    "the accessible values of @xmath17 and the corresponding crossover fields depend on the bulk electron density .",
    "in section iii we evaluate the _ full _ @xmath22 in 3d ti thin films , which comprises coupled bulk and surface contributions .",
    "sections iiia and iiib cover preliminary material that is needed to derive the main results in iiic .",
    "section iiia reviews the well - established fact that , in absence of magnetic order , isolated ti surface states exhibit wal with @xmath20 ( in this paper we assume one dirac cone per surface ) .",
    "section iiib develops a diagrammatic framework for evaluating quantum corrections to conductivity in ordinary tunnel - coupled layers .",
    "readers who are not interested in technicalities can disregard the diagrams in the figures and concentrate on the outcome of the calculation ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : q1])-([eq : dii ] ) ) , as well as on the subsequent discussion .",
    "one qualitative point made therein is that the crossover from weak to strong coupling ( which is accompanied by a change in @xmath17 from @xmath27 to @xmath18 ) occurs when the interlayer resistance for a square of area @xmath28 becomes smaller than the sum of the classical intralayer resistances .",
    "section iiic combines results from iid , iiia and iiib in order to figure out quantum corrections to conductivity in experimentally realized ti films .",
    "the most important results in iiic are eqs .",
    "( [ eq : res_tot ] ) and  ( [ eq : res_tot5 ] ) , which describe how @xmath22 depends on the bulk doping concentration , on the phase relaxation rate , and on the bulk - surface tunneling rate .",
    "some special cases of these results are highlighted in appendix  [ sec : special ] .",
    "a salient conclusion is that the wl regime of isolated bulk states is generally eliminated when either one of the film surfaces is strongly coupled to bulk states , in which case the film displays @xmath29 .",
    "however , wl can still be present if the ti surfaces have short phase relaxation lengths .",
    "finally , section iiid characterizes the electrostatics of the depletion layer and estimates the bulk - surface tunneling rate in ti films .",
    "this estimate confirms experimental indications showing that both weak and strong bulk - surface coupling are accessible by mediation of a gate voltage .",
    "this section is devoted to evaluating @xmath0 for the bulk states of a 3d ti . as a byproduct",
    ", we derive @xmath0 for a time - reversal symmetric weyl semimetal . the contribution from ti surface states",
    "will be discarded until the next section .",
    "the bulk band structure of a 3d ti near the @xmath23 point can be approximated by the following @xmath30 hamiltonian :  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an orbital pseudospin ( @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 is the real spin ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 is the momentum measured from the @xmath23 point of the brillouin zone , @xmath37 is an @xmath38 identity matrix , @xmath39 is a 4-spinor , @xmath40 is the part of the hamiltonian that is independent of spin / pseudospin indices , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the fermi velocities , and @xmath43 is the mass term ( independent of spin ) .",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are constants .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : model_b ] ) captures the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band in the vicinity of the @xmath23 point ( @xmath47 ) , where the bandgap is smallest .",
    "it models 3d dirac fermions with a dirac mass that equals half the energy gap .",
    "for the purposes of this paper we ignore @xmath48 , and assume @xmath49 as well as spherical symmetry ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "these assumptions simplify calculations without incurring in qualitative loss of generality . for instance , the xxz anisotropy can be modeled by promoting the diffusion constant from a scalar to a matrix .",
    "also , the @xmath51 terms in @xmath52 can be incorporated into our final results by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the fermi wave vector .",

    "this @xmath17 is obviously unrelated to that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hikami ] ) ; from here on it will be clear from the context which one we are referring to . for concreteness we set the chemical potential in the bulk conduction band , although all results obtained below will be directly applicable to @xmath65-doped bulk tis as well .",

    "in addition , the @xmath72 band dispersion absent in 2d can not be neglected in our case .",
    "these two features make the calculations and results of this section quite different from those of refs .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : model_b ] ) becomes inaccurate when the chemical potential moves up in the conduction band and electron pockets away from the @xmath23 point begin to be populated .",
    "these additional pockets contribute to quantum interference , and the total @xmath0 depends on the scattering rate between different electron pockets .",
