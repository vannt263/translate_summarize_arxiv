    "herbig ae / be stars ( haebes ) are pre - main sequence ( pms ) objects of intermediate mass approximately from 2 to 8@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the range of spectral classes f2  b0 .",
    "they are surrounded by dust / gas accretion disks .",
    "remote cold dust reveals itself in the form of a far - ir excess , and numerous emission lines originate in the circumstellar ( cs ) envelope .",
    "this envelope has a complex spatial structure and contains an equatorial accretion disk and matter outflows in the form of a stellar / disk wind at higher latitudes .",
    "one of the important unresolved problems in the haebes is the character of the interaction between the accretion disk and the central star . for the lower - mass pms objects , the classical ttauri stars ( ctts ) with a similar structure of their cs envelopes and strong magnetic fields of the order of kg , the magnetospheric accretion ( ma ) model",
    "is generally recognized .",
    "according to this model , the accretion disk does not contact directly the stellar surface , but is truncated by the stellar magnetic field at some distance from the star .",
    "a part of the accreted material falls onto the star near magnetic pole regions along the closed magnetic field lines , another part outflows away along the open force lines @xcite .",
    "however , the haebes have weaker magnetic fields ( several 100 g ) .",
    "is the ma model also applicable to them ?",
    "if the magnetic axis does not coincide with the rotation axis , a rotational modulation of the line profiles has to be observed with a period @xmath7 equal to the rotational period @xmath2 of the star .",
    "we tried to find signatures of such modulation in the spectra of our program stars .",
    "hd101412 is an early ae star with an unusually large magnetic field ( @xmath8  kg ) , which is more typical for ctts than for haebes .",
    "a magnetic dipole model of the object has been suggested by @xcite .",
    "it ensures a good fitting of observational data , the @xmath9 sine - like phase dependency constructed with @xmath2 = @xmath10 is presented in fig.4 of @xcite .",
    "the second object of our program , hd104237 , is a well - known binary system ( a : pe+k ) with a ttauri star as a secondary .",
    "the orbital solution of the system has been obtained in @xcite : @xmath11 = 19.859@xmath12 , @xmath13 = 0.66 .",
    "the object is the first haebe star for which the magnetic field was measured with @xmath14 g @xcite .",
    "further observations and work by @xcite did not confirm this result , but recently @xcite testified the presence of a weak magnetic field ( @xmath15=@xmath16 g ) .",
    "we can expect that the magnetic field of the object is variable .",
    "the last program object , hd190073 , is a peculiar herbig a2  ivpe star ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "its magnetic field ( @xmath17100 g ) has been measured by various authors @xcite .",
    "there are clear indications of its variability .",
    "three instruments installed at the vlt-8 m telescopes ( eso , chile ) were used for spectroscopic observations of the program stars in the near - ir region .",
    "eight spectra of hd104237 ( march - april 2013 ) and five spectra of hd190073 ( august - september 2013 ) were acquired with isaac ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "13 spectra of hd101412 ( december 2013 - march 2014 ) , 13 spectra of hd104237 ( november 2013 - january 2014 ) and six spectra of hd190073 ( march - september 2010 ) were obtained using x - shooter ( @xmath19 ) . these spectra cover a wide spectral range from the near - uv to",
    "the near - ir and also include the hei @xmath05876 line .",
    "nine additional spectra of hd101412 ( april 2011 - march 2013 ) were acquired with crires ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the @xmath21 ratio of all spectra was between 200 and 400 .",
    "additionally , 51 spectra of hd190073 near the hei @xmath05876 line were collected from archives of several observatories ( eso , ohp , crimean ao ) , which were obtained between 1994 and 2013 @xcite .",
    "typical profiles of the two ir lines hei @xmath010830 and pa@xmath1 in the spectra of hd101412 ( crires ) and hd104237 ( isaac ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ ex - fig1 ] .",
    "the emission hei line profile of hd101412 has two redshifted absorption components .",
    "one is wide , shallow , and strongly redshifted .",
    "the second is narrow , deep and with a weak red shift .",
    "the emission profile of the pa@xmath1 line is a single one with a central absorption .",
    "the profiles of these two ir lines in the spectrum of hd104237 demonstrate quite different types .",
    "the hei line profiles are of pcyg type , which is evidence for a strong stellar wind and an intermediate orientation of the rotation axis relative to the line of sight .",
    "the pa@xmath1 line does not show signs of wind .",
    "its density is not enough to be visible in this subordinate line . as in the case of hd104237",
    ", hd190073 has similar ir line profiles : hei @xmath010830 with a pcyg structure and pa@xmath1 with a single emission profile .",
    "this object has also an intermediate orientation relative to the observer .",
    "the hei @xmath05876 line profiles appear as single emissions too .",
    "the model of the magnetic dipole - type field of hd101412 @xcite suggests that the angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight is @xmath22 , and the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes is @xmath23 .",
    "with such an orientation , the magnetic axis has to be located close to the disk plane .",
    "the ma model predicts two flows of material falling down onto each magnetic pole region . during one period , two episodes of velocity increase towards the star",
    "should be observed .",
    "[ ex - fig2 ] ( _ left _ ) illustrates the temporal behaviour of the different parameters of the hei @xmath010830 profile depending on the phase of @xmath2 = @xmath24 .",
    "this quasi - resonance line is formed in the high - temperature regions ( @xmath25k ) including the innermost disk and the two accretion flows . the velocity @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ ex - fig2 ] , _ top left _ ) characterizes the kinematics at the disk , and the velocity @xmath27 the kinematics at the flows .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ ex - fig2 ] ( _ bottom left _ ) , that @xmath27 reaches its maxima twice per period exactly at the phases where @xmath9 has the positive and negative extrema ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* fig.4 ) .",
    "these are the phases when the magnetic poles cross near the line of sight .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath26 is similar , but with a smaller amplitude : the accretion process from the innermost disk is just beginning .",
    "the pa@xmath1 line is formed over a more extended region of the disk , and the accretion flows in this line are less noticeable .",
    "the behaviour of the hei line parameters fully confirms the ma model predictions .    unlike hd101412",
    ", the line profiles of hd104237 do not show absorption related to the accretion flow ( apart from march 25 , 2013 ) , see fig .",
    "[ ex - fig1 ] ( _ right _ )",
    ". however , screening of the stellar limb by the accretion flow appears as a depression in the red wing of the emission profile : the velocity of the red wing edge @xmath27 and the equivalent width @xmath28 * * decrease .",
    "[ ex - fig2 ] ( _ right _ ) shows that variations of these parameters for both ir lines have a notable correlation . unlike @xmath27 ,",
    "the velocity of the blue wing edge @xmath29 of these lines does not correlate with @xmath28 .",
    "this confirms our assumption that the depression of the profile red wing is linked to the flow passing across the line of sight .",
    "we tried to determine the rotation period , @xmath2 , of hd104237 using a method based on fitting phase dependencies for each value of the trial period @xmath7 with a sinusoid for a wide range of @xmath2 ( 3.8  6.8 days ) with a step width of @xmath30 .",
    "the parameters of the sinusoid , such as amplitude @xmath31 , constant coefficient c , and initial phase @xmath32 were determined using a standard least - square method for each value of @xmath2 .",
    "[ ex - fig3 ] ( _ left _ ) illustrates the periodograms calculated for the parameter @xmath28 of the pa@xmath1 line , where @xmath33 is the standard deviation of values from the sine line .",
    "we calculated also the periodogram for the parameter @xmath34 which is the mean square value of the fractional remainder after dividing all time intervals between neighboring observations by a trial period @xmath2 .",
    "if the intervals are close to an integer number of @xmath2 , then @xmath34 is close to zero . in our case",
    "we have found @xmath2 = @xmath35 for the parameter @xmath28 of the pa@xmath1 line and have been convinced that this value does not correspond to a minimum of the parameter @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , our estimation of @xmath2 is not a result of the sampling dates .",
    "we plotted periodograms for parameters @xmath28 and @xmath27 for the lines hei @xmath05876 , @xmath010830 and pa@xmath1 : for isaac data ( 8 dates ) , x - shooter data ( 13 dates ) , and all of the dates together ( 21 dates ) .",
    "the total number of obtained periodograms was 14 , the parameters of the sinusoid @xmath31 and @xmath32 were determined for each case .",
    "after averaging , the results were : @xmath2 = @xmath36 , @xmath32 = @xmath37 .",
    "the phase dependencies of the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath27 for different lines in the spectrum of hd104237 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ex - fig3 ] ( _ right _ ) .",
    "using standard formulas , we derived the inclination angle @xmath38 .",
    "several estimations of the stellar radius @xmath39 were given in @xcite with a mean value of @xmath40@xmath41 .",
    "the following values of @xmath42sin@xmath38 were published in different papers : @xmath43kms@xmath44 @xcite , @xmath45kms@xmath44 @xcite , and @xmath46kms@xmath44 @xcite .",
    "adopting @xmath42sin@xmath38=@xmath47kms@xmath44 , we derived @xmath4 .    for hd190073 , we had only 11 spectra in the ir region in the period 2010  2013 , which was not enough for a detailed study .",
    "the analysis of 51 optical spectra near the hei @xmath05876 line showed the presence of a large - amplitude variability on the timescale from 1 day to several years .",
    "we separated two main types of this variability , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ex - fig4 ] ( _ left _ ) : _ a ) _ a global change of intensity of the line without variations in the shape of the profile ( type  i ) , and _",
    "b ) _ a distortion of the red wing of the emission profile , as also observed for hd104237 ( type  ii ) .",
    "[ ex - fig4 ] ( _ right _ ) shows the correlations of @xmath27 and @xmath29 with the @xmath28 of the line . in the case of the @xmath29/@xmath28 dependency ,",
    "a notable but rather weak correlation is observed ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this correlation corresponds to the type  i variability .",
    "the @xmath27/@xmath28 correlation is much stronger ( @xmath49 ) , it corresponds to both variability types  i and ii . we can see that the contribution of the type  ii variability is rather strong in the global behavior of the hei @xmath05876 line profile variations in the spectra of hd190073 .",
    "unfortunately , other attempts to exactly determine the @xmath2 of hd190073 were not successful .",
    "however , the behaviour of the @xmath27/@xmath28 parameter confirms ( as in the case of hd104237 ) our assumption of a rotating accretion flow that distorts the red wing of the emission hei @xmath05876 profile .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field configuration of hd190073 can be more complex than a simple dipole , and the whole picture of spectral variability is less simple .",
    "magnetic field measurements were done using high - resolution spectra of hd104237 and hd190073 obtained using the harps instrument in polarimetric mode , installed at the 3.6-m eso telescope ( chile ) and retrieved from the eso archive .",
    "we used the multiline singular value decomposition ( svd ) method for stokes profile reconstruction @xcite .",
    "for hd104237 , we can see polarization features corresponding to the primary component ( rather marginal ) and to the secondary component of this binary system ( fig .",
    "[ ex - fig5 ] , _ left _ ) .",
    "the latter is quite notable with @xmath50 g .",
    "this is the first discovery of the magnetic field of the secondary of hd104237 .",
    "another situation is found for hd190073 . instead of one polarization feature corresponding to the svd absorption line ,",
    "we see two features of opposite signs centered at emission wings around the central absorption ( fig .",
    "[ ex - fig5 ] , _ right _ ) .",
    "it is possible that the cs component has a significant contribution to the general configuration of the magnetic field of hd190073 .",
