    "the well - known constantly being revised unified model ( um ) have been widely accepted to explain most of the different observed phenomena between broad line active galactic nuclei ( type-1 agn ) and narrow line agn ( type-2 agn ) , due to expected different orientation angles of the central accretion disk @xcite , combining with different central activity and different properties of the inner dust torus etc . @xcite .",
    "the more recent review on the um can be found in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the um simply indicates that type-2 agn are intrinsically like type-1 agn , but their central regions including broad line regions ( blrs ) are hidden from our view by central dust torus and/or high density dust clouds , and the unobscured narrow emission lines can be well applied to trace the central region properties of type-2 agn .",
    "strong emission lines coming from nlrs can be treated as one of the fundamental characteristics of agn , and line luminosity is arguably the best available substitute for agn intrinsic luminosity which have been studied , proved and reported in @xcite , etc . , although scatters may be a bit large for the correlations between the luminosity and the continuum luminosity ( optical band , infrared radiation band or x - ray band luminosity , etc . ) .",
    "therefore , even in type-2 agn with central regions totally obscured by dust torus ( no observed optical broad emission lines in observed spectra ) , the line luminosity can be commonly applied to estimate agn luminosity .    besides the strong connection between the line luminosity and the agn continuum luminosity",
    ", we can also notice that nlrs can be directly spatially resolved in nearby agn , due to long distances of nlrs to central black holes and very extended structures of nlrs , such as the results based on high - quality images in @xcite .",
    "the distances of nlrs to central black holes ( nlrs sizes ) can be estimated by the line luminosity , leading to the result that the agn nlrs sizes ( tens of pcs to thousands of pcs ) are more longer than the agn blrs sizes ( commonly several light - days to several hundreds of light - days , such as the more recent results in @xcite ) , leading to a vast space between the nlrs and the blrs . and",
    "since the first oversimplified results on properties of the vast space in @xcite based on expected dusts in nlrs , there is so far no clear and confirmed information on materials and corresponding dynamic structures in the space between the nlrs and the blrs in agn .",
    "meanwhile , based on profile properties of emission lines , part of agn have their observed lines with much extended wings , such as the well shown results in @xcite",
    ". meanwhile , there are many studies on the shifted extended components in the emission lines .",
    "@xcite have suggested dust and gas radial flows in narrow line regions with respect to the nucleus , in order to well explain the asymmetry of line due to the extended wings . @xcite",
    "have found moderately strong correlation between stellar velocity dispersions and widths of the core components of emission lines but more weaker correlation with widths of the extended wings of emission lines . @xcite",
    "have suggested that outflowing components could lead to blue - shifted extended wings of emission lines especially in type-1 agn .",
    "@xcite have reported evidence on outflows ultimately driven by the radiative output of the quasars , based on studies of shifted extended components of emission lines . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the extended wings of emission lines ( probable from outflows ) should be a component not dominated by the bulge gravitational potential .",
    "although there is so far no clear evidence on the physical origin of the extended wings of the lines , we can expect that the extended wings of the lines should be more nearer to central regions due to their larger line widths , and perhaps properties of the extended wings could provide some information on materials in the vast space between the nlrs and the blrs .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to check properties of the extended wings of the lines , through the reported correlation between the line luminosity and the agn continuum luminosity after considerations of contributions of the extended wings . in this manuscript ,",
    "we analyze properties of the emission lines for a large sample of qsos with high quality spectra . and",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we show our main data sample . in section 3 ,",
    "we show our main results and necessary discussions .",
    "then , in section 4 , we give our final conclusions .",
    "and in this manuscript , the cosmological parameters of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 have been adopted .",
    "in this manuscript , we consider all qsos with absolute magnitudes at i band smaller than -22.0 and with at least one emission line having width larger than 1000  @xmath7 ( see more detailed techniques discussed in @xcite ) in more recent sloan digital sky survey , data release 12 ( sdss dr12 , @xcite ) by the following two criteria : redshift @xmath0 to ensure lines included in sdss spectra and mean signal - to - noise at g - band and at r - band larger than 20 to ensure high quality spectra around emission lines . here , the convenient structured query language ( sql ) queries run from sdss dr12 skyserver search tools ( skyserver.sdss.org/dr12/en/tools/search/sql.aspx ) by keywords of instrument = sdss , class = qso , z < 0.8 and zwarning=0 , snmedian_g > 20 and snmedian_r > 20 from sdss datatable of specobjall. based on the criteria , there are 2820 qsos selected from sdss dr12 .",
    "then , emission line parameters and continuum emissions for each qso can be measured from the sdss spectrum as follows . here , in this manuscript , lines are mainly focused on . for the emission lines around h@xmath8 with rest wavelength from 4300  to 5600 : broad and narrow h@xmath8 , doublet , he  ii line and probable optical fe  ii lines , the following model functions and fe",
    "ii templates are applied .",
    "three ( or more if necessary ) broad gaussian functions are applied to the broad h@xmath8 , one narrow gaussian function is applied to the narrow h@xmath8 , one broad gaussian function is applied to the probable he  ii line , two narrow gaussian functions are applied to the doublet and two another gaussian functions are applied to the probable extended components of the doublet . and",
    "the more recent discussed fe  ii template in @xcite is applied to describe the optical fe  ii lines . and a power - law function is applied to describe the agn continuum emissions underneath the emission lines .",
    "moreover , when the model functions and the fe  ii template are applied , besides limitation of the same redshift to the narrow lines , no further restrictions are applied . in other words , it is allowed to have a bit different widths of the narrow h@xmath8 and the narrow doublet . here",
    ", a broad gaussian function means the function with second moment no smaller than 800  @xmath7 .",
    "and a narrow gaussian function means the function with second moment no larger than 600  @xmath7 .",
    "the much similar emission line fitting procedure can also be found in our more recent paper in @xcite .",
    "then , through the levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization technique , emission lines can be well fitted , and basic parameters and corresponding uncertainties can be well determined .",
    "then , we check the fitted results for the emission lines of the selected 2820 qsos by eyes . and 838 objects are rejected , due to loss of lines ( many bad pixels around or no detected apparent lines ) . finally , there are 1982 qsos with blue spectra and measured line parameters at least three times larger than their corresponding uncertainties included in our final main sample . here , we do not show the best fitted results to the emission lines for all the selected qsos , but fig .",
    "[ line ] shows three examples on the best fitted results to the emission lines in sdss 1736 - 53052 - 0585 ,",
    "2517 - 54567 - 0563 and 1380 - 53084 - 0058 ( plate - mjd - fiberid ) , respectively .",
    "in sdss 1736 - 53052 - 0585 and sdss 2517 - 54567 - 0563 , one gaussian component is enough to describe the [ o  iii]@xmath15007  line , but in sdss 1380 - 53084 - 0058 , two components are necessary to well describe the [ o  iii]@xmath15007  line .    before proceeding further to check the expected correlation between the luminosity and the agn continuum luminosity , it is necessary to ensure whether our measured parameters ( especially the luminosity including contributions of the extended wings and continuum luminosity ) are reliable .",
    "we can find that among the 1982 qsos in our main sample , 810 qsos can also be found in the sample of @xcite .",
    "then , we compare our measured parameters ( the total luminosity @xmath2}$ ] and continuum luminosity @xmath9 ) with the reported values of @xmath2,~s11}$ ] and @xmath10 of the 810 qsos in @xcite . fig .",

    "similar results can be confirmed between our measured parameters and the reported values in @xcite , except about three outliers marked by solid circles in red in fig .",
    "however , we have checked our fitted results for the three outliers which have been shown in fig .",
    "[ line ] , and found our parameters should be better .",
    "we do not know the clear reasons to the different and/or continuum luminosities from them reported in @xcite for the three outliers .",
    "the main difference of the fitting procedures in @xcite and in the manuscript is the different optical fe  ii template applied .",
    "@xcite have accepted the fe  ii template discussed in @xcite . in our fitting procedure , the fe  ii template discussed in @xcite",
    "have been accepted .",
    "however , the different fe  ii templates should not lead to different continuum emissions at 5100  or different [ o  iii ] luminosity .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ comp ] indicate our measured and continuum luminosities are reliable .    finally , based on the high quality sdss spectra and the measured parameters ,",
    "there are 1982 blue qsos with the reliable line parameters of the lines and the reliable measured continuum luminosity in our final main sample . and",
    "based on the fitted results to the emission lines around h@xmath8 , there are 708 qsos with their [ o  iii]@xmath15007   described by two reliable components of one core plus one extended wing .",
    "then , we can check the contributions of the extended wings of the lines to the correlation between the luminosity and the continuum luminosity .",
    "because of the large size of the data sample on the 1982 qsos ( or even for the 708 qsos of which lines include extended wings ) , we do not list the basic parameters for all the qsos in the manuscript .",
    "but , the basic parameters saved in fit files and the best fitted results to the emission lines of the qsos saved in eps files can be downloaded from the website of http://pan.baidu.com/s/1c1nh1b6 .",
    "in order to confirm our following results on properties of different components of the emission lines , it is necessary to confirm whether are the determined extended components truly from [ o  iii ] clouds , not from the common broad emission line clouds ( such as , the extended components could be expected from broad h@xmath8 line clouds ) . here , two ways are applied to confirm the extended components are from clouds not from broad line clouds , based on the effects of the extended components on central wavelength and line width of the broad h@xmath8 . on the one hand , we show an example to clearly declare the extended components are from clouds , no from broad h@xmath8 clouds . fig .  [ line2 ] shows the emission lines and the fitted results in the object sdss 0432 - 51884 - 0246 , which has the second moment of the extended component of the [ o  iii]@xmath15007  larger than 2000  @xmath7 . then , based on the results shown in fig .",
    "[ line2 ] , we can find that if the extended components were from the broad h@xmath8 clouds , there could be much different line profiles of the broad h@xmath8 and the broad h@xmath11 : the solid line in yellow , the dotted line in red and the dashed line in red shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ line2 ] . in order to show more clearer effects of the extended components",
    ", we check central wavelengths of the broad h@xmath8 with and without contributions of the extended components . through the determined broad line profile without the contributions of the extended component ,",
    "the central wavelength of the broad h@xmath8 is about 4866 .",
    "however , with considerations of the extended components to the broad h@xmath8 , the central wavelength should be about 4887 .",
    "meanwhile , the central wavelength of the broad h@xmath11 is about 6566 , leading to the expected central wavelength of the broad h@xmath8 of about 4865 . here",
    ", the central wavelengths are calculated by the definition shown in the following equation ( 1 ) .",
    "therefore , under the accepted criterion that there are similar line profiles of the broad balmer lines , the extended components are preferred from the clouds in sdss 0432 - 51884 - 0246 .",
    "on the other hand , we check the central wavelength correlation and the broad line width correlation between the broad h@xmath8 and the broad h@xmath11 for the 205 low redshift qsos with both the broad h@xmath8 and the broad h@xmath11 included in their sdss spectra . here , rather than the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , the second moment is applied , because the extended components of the lines have more stronger effects on the second moment than on the fwhm .",
    "the second moment @xmath12 and the central wavelength @xmath13 are calculated by the line profiles through the definitions in @xcite , @xmath14 , where @xmath1 and @xmath15 represent the wavelength and the broad line profile , respectively . here",
    ", the rest wavelength ranges from 4700   to 5020  and from 6400  to 6720  are applied to calculate the @xmath12 and the @xmath13 of the broad h@xmath8 and the broad h@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "then , two kinds of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are calculated for the broad h@xmath8 , with and without contributions of the extended components of the lines .",

    "the spearman rank correlation coefficients are 0.85 and 0.85 for the central wavelength correlation and for the broad line width correlation , respectively . and based on the more recent least trimmed squares robust ( ltsr ) technique @xcite ( the lts_linefit code provided by prof .",
    "cappellari m. , see also in http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~mxc/software ) with considerations of the uncertainties in both coordinates , the strong linear broad line width correlation can be described by @xmath16 . and",
    "the central wavelengths of the broad h@xmath11 and the broad h@xmath8 are well described by the expected relationship of @xmath17 ( where 6564.61  and 4862.68  are the theoretical central wavelengths of the h@xmath11 and the h@xmath8 ) .",
    "then , bottom panels of fig .  [ width2 ] show the two loose correlations on the @xmath18 and the @xmath19 determined from the pure broad components of the h@xmath8 plus the extended components of the lines , if we assumed that the extended components were from broad h@xmath8 emission clouds .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficients are 0.22 and 0.49 for the central wavelength correlation and for the broad line width correlation , respectively .",
    "in other words , under assumptions that the extended components were from the broad h@xmath8 emission clouds , there could be much different profiles of the broad h@xmath8 and the broad h@xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the results shown in fig .  [ width2 ] strongly support that the determined extended components are true components from the clouds not from the broad line clouds .",
    "once we confirm the extended components are truly from the clouds , we can discuss our main results on the core and the extended components of the emission lines .",

    "the strong linear correlations shown in fig .  [ o32 ] strongly indicate that the extended components should be not from radial flows in the common emission line clouds .    besides , we simply discuss the probable locations of the extended components of the lines . the wider extended components ( mean second moment of about 500  @xmath7 ) can be not broadened by commonly applied broadening techniques for narrow forbidden emission lines .",
    "another technique should be considered .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the gravity influence radius of central supermassive black hole could be about @xmath27 , where @xmath28 represents stellar velocity dispersion in host galaxy .",
    "after checking of the sdss provided stellar velocity dispersions of type-2 agn in main galaxies , the common stellar velocity dispersions are about 100 - 200  @xmath7 in host galaxies of agn .",
    "therefore , the gravity of central supermassive black holes could affect emission line clouds with distance about several pcs to central black holes with bh masses of about @xmath29 . then , with consideration of virial effects of gravity of central black holes , the broader extended components could be naturally accepted , if the extended components were from regions more nearer to central black holes .",
    "moreover , the locations of the extended components nearer to central black holes can be naturally applied to explain why part of qsos without observed extended components of lines , due to more higher electron density in the clouds nearer to central regions than the critical density for forbidden line . moreover , among the 708 qsos with their [ o  iii]@xmath15007  well described by two components , 608 qsos have the blue - shifted extended components .",

    "<S> in this manuscript , we check the well - known correlation between luminosity and continuum luminosity ( ) for agn by a large sample of 1982 sdss qsos with @xmath0 and with high quality spectra . the strong correlation of can be found , similar as previous results for agn . moreover , among the 1982 qsos , there are 708 qsos with the [ o  iii]@xmath15007  described by two components : one core component plus one extended component . based on the luminosity from the core components ( @xmath2,~narrow}$ ] ) and from the extended components ( @xmath2,~ext}$ ] ) , we confirm that the correlation of @xmath3,~ext}}~-~l_{{\\rm 5100\\textsc{\\aa}}}$ ] is more stronger and tighter than the correlations on the total luminosity and on the luminosity of the core components of the lines . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the luminosity of the extended components should be better applied to trace agn intrinsic luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , we have found strong line width correlation and line luminosity correlation between the core components and the extended components , indicating the extended components of the lines should be not due to commonly considered radial flows in the common line clouds . and virial effects due to gravity of central black holes naturally lead to the wider extended components from regions more nearer to central black holes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we can say that the reported correlation of @xmath3,~narrow}}~-~l_{{\\rm 5100\\textsc{\\aa}}}$ ] on the core components of the lines should be more better to estimate agn intrinsic luminosity in type-2 narrow line agn , because of totally / partly obscured extended components .    </S>",
