    "the aim of this article is two - fold : first , to provide an analytical description of random dynamical decoupling because analytical expressions are often more manageable than combinatoric - numerical ones ; second , to use this description to propose a partial method of detecting intrinsic decoherence of quantum systems .",
    "dynamical decoupling is a method applied to stabilise states of quantum registers against undesired time - evolution . originally invented in nmr technology",
    ", it has been generalised to a wider context , in particular in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "it works by application of repeated instantaneous unitary correction pulses on the quantum register , perturbing the original time - evolution .",
    "the procedure is particularly interesting and effective when performed in a random way @xcite .    while several general estimates and specialisations of the procedure have been proposed in the past ( cf .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) , our focus here is on finding handy analytical descriptions of the time - evolution of expectation and distribution of physically interesting quantities like the density matrix process or the gate fidelity process arising from this random time - evolution .",
    "we believe that such descriptions are a valuable tool in future computations and enable predictions in experiments .",
    "we would like to provide now a rough overview of the content of this article .",
    "let @xmath0 stand for a generic finite - dimensional quantum system , with @xmath1 a finite - dimensional complex hilbert space and @xmath2 a possibly time - dependent lindblad generator ( cf .",
    "@xcite for general background information ) .",
    "we start in section [ sec : two ] by introducing dynamical decoupling and show that the decoupling condition can be satisfied only if @xmath3 $ ] for some hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "this might sound like a contradiction since dynamical decoupling aims to eliminate decoherence ( noise ) arising from open systems .",
    "it can be resolved by differentiating between _ intrinsic _ and _ extrinsic decoherence _ :",
    "the latter one is where decoherence arises from interaction with an actual quantum heat bath or environment such that the total space time - evolution is unitary , the former one is where decoherence is actually the time - evolution of a closed system @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether intrinsic decoherence may appear in nature , and it would , of course , contradict the axiom of unitary time - evolution .",
    "but in order to find out whether it may exist or whether the axiom of unitarity is always verified , one has to perform experiments and develop mathematical tools .    to this end , sections [ sec : three ] and [ sec : four ] provide a probabilistic - analytical approach to dynamical decoupling , namely : we set up a probabilistic description of a random walk in the completely positive trace - preserving ( cpt ) maps of the quantum system arising from the random correction pulses ; then we study the continuum - limit of this random walk under a suitable scaling , which becomes a gaussian ( markov ) process in the cpt maps .",
    "we use this to determine the expectation and higher moments of the density matrix process @xmath5 . in the [ sec : four]th section we then compute the expectation of the gate fidelity , which might be regarded as a mean fidelity when averaging over all states on @xmath6 in a suitable manner .",
    "we illustrate all constructions and considerations with an easy example that shall accompany us through the paper .    up to this point , things were quite general , but this is where we can turn to our second aim : distinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic decoherence ( with bounded hamiltonian dilations , cf .",
    "* app . ) ) .",
    "we therefore specialise in the final section [ sec : five ] on providing approximative bounds for the gate fidelity in these two extremal cases together with a recipe which should enable the experimenter to determine the type of decoherence present in his setting .",
    "ideally he should just know the pulse length @xmath7 , the total time @xmath8 of evolution , and the coupling strength of the undesired decoherence . in some cases unfortunately some further input is needed .",
    "however , the overall moral is roughly speaking the following : the rate of decoherence decreases to @xmath9 when @xmath10 if decoherence is extrinsic and due to bounded interaction @xcite ; it remains essentially unaffected by the decoupling procedure if decoherence is intrinsic . in other words ,",
    "if random dynamical decoupling with @xmath10 does not eliminate decoherence , then it was intrinsic or due to unbounded interaction !",
    "model studies and illustrations of this procedure can be found in the companion article @xcite .",

    "moreover , rh would like to thank gernot alber and burkhard kmmerer for guidance in his master thesis several years ago , in which a special case of section [ sec : three ] had been developed .",
    "let us start with some notation used throughout the article .",
    "we shall denote our quantum system in question by @xmath0 , with @xmath1 a finite - dimensional complex hilbert space ( of dimension @xmath11 ) and we denote the adjoint of linear maps on it by ` @xmath12 ' ; @xmath2 is the lindblad operator on @xmath6 , generating the completely positive trace - preserving ( cpt ) time evolution maps @xmath13 , @xmath14 , of the quantum system ( cf .",

    "[ ex:1 ] the standard illustrative example of a finite - dimensional quantum system to keep in mind throughout this paper is an @xmath30-qubit quantum system , so @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; there typically the decoupling set @xmath33 consists of the @xmath34 different combinations of pauli matrices @xmath35 on the tensor factors . here",
    "@xmath36 . , for all @xmath37 .",
    "given the cpt semigroup of time evolution maps @xmath38 of our system and a (  short \" ) time @xmath7 , consider the externally modified time evolution @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 forms a certain sequence in @xmath42 with @xmath43 , meaning we apply _ instantaneous decoupling _ or _",

    "our first goal is to find an analytical description of the externally modified time evolution @xmath49 . in the random",
    "setting , @xmath50 becomes a stochastic process ( a random walk with steps lasting time @xmath7 ) induced by the process @xmath51 with independent identically distributed ( iid ) and equidistributed @xcite increments in @xmath33 , and we are interested in the limit @xmath10 , which would enable nice analytical expressions .",
    "since @xmath52 , we find @xmath53 so the increment during the time interval @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 .",
    "we say that @xmath33 satisfies the _ decoupling condition _ for @xmath0",
    "if @xmath56 the idea behind this condition is that it ensures cancellation of interaction at first order in @xmath57 , i.e. ,  for short time @xmath7 , and thus higher order terms contribute .",
    "we say ( the time evolution of ) our quantum system @xmath0 is _ purely unitary _ if @xmath58 , with @xmath59 selfadjoint , because in this case @xmath13 is induced by a one - parameter family of unitary matrices ; in this case @xmath60 .",
    "the `` opposite case '' , namely where @xmath61 we call _ purely dephasing_.    [ lem : deccond - unitary ] a decoupling set for @xmath0 satisfies the decoupling condition iff @xmath0 is purely unitary .",
    "we write out the generator @xmath2 in christensen - evans form @xcite @xmath62 with a certain @xmath63 and completely positive @xmath64 which is not a multiple of @xmath65 ( w.l.o.g . , because adding @xmath66 to @xmath64 has the same result on @xmath2 as adding @xmath67 to @xmath68 ) .",
    "suppose first that @xmath69 is purely unitary ; then @xmath70 and @xmath71 . from , with @xmath42 indexing the decoupling set @xmath72 as above ,",
    "we obtain @xmath73 so @xmath33 satisfies the decoupling condition . if instead @xmath69 is not purely unitary , we have @xmath74 and hence @xmath75 is completely positive and nonzero .",
    "suppose @xmath76 equals @xmath77 then , for every rank - one projection @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 .",
    "but for every @xmath80 with @xmath81 , we have @xmath82 with each single term @xmath83 , due to the positivity of @xmath64 and the scalar product , and thus actually @xmath84 .",
    "in particular , since @xmath85 , we have @xmath86 , so @xmath87 .",
    "let us write @xmath64 in ( minimal ) kraus form with @xmath88 its kraus rank and certain @xmath89 @xcite : @xmath90 this entails then , for any two mutually orthogonal vectors @xmath91 , @xmath92 hence , for every @xmath93 , we see that @xmath94 , or in other words , @xmath95 must be an eigenvector of @xmath96 .",
    "this holds for every @xmath97 , so @xmath98 , and thus @xmath64 is a multiple of @xmath65 , which contradicts our initial assumptions .",
    "therefore , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 i.e. ,  @xmath33 on @xmath0 does not satisfy the decoupling condition .    despite this result",
    ", it will turn out in the course of this paper that dynamical decoupling is still interesting beyond the unitary case .",
    "we continue with the notation and concepts introduced in the previous section .",
    "let us , in particular , assume all increments @xmath101 , with @xmath102 , in our random walk @xmath103 of decoupling pulses to be iid and equidistributed in @xmath33 as in the preceding section .",
    "the induced random walk @xmath104 lies in the completely positive maps on @xmath21 according to and .",
    "moreover , since completely positive maps are linear maps of the hilbert space @xmath21 and since all the increments are invertible , the random walk actually lies in the group @xmath105 of invertible linear maps of @xmath21 , and @xmath106 , the lie algebra of @xmath105 .",
    "this induced random walk has again iid increments and is described by the measure @xmath107 we would like to investigate it in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "however , since @xmath7 is an actual physical quantity in our set - up , we keep it and instead consider a fictitious limit , which should be good for small @xmath7 , as explained below .",
    "considering simply @xmath108 and the limit of @xmath10 , we would obtain a drift - like expression without fluctuations , which is not a really physical result but a good first approximation , cf .   and remark [ rem : drift - limit ] .",
    "in fact , the well - known donsker invariance principle @xcite basically says that the limit of a classical random walk is described suitably well by brownian motion , i.e. ,  by scaling length increments with the square - root of time increments , supposed that the expectation of every increment is @xmath9 .",
    "the following kind of central limit theorem helps us to treat these dissipation - fluctuation terms in the present noncommutative setting , and will thus become a building stone in our construction ; it has first been stated in @xcite but can also be found in the textbook ( * ? ? ? *",

    "we would like to apply this theorem to our setting , namely where @xmath133 and @xmath134 regarded as ( real ! ) linear lie group and algebra , respectively , and subspaces of @xmath135 .",

    "the drift part should correspond to the original drift part resulting from .",
    "putting @xmath138 and @xmath139 let us define the measures @xmath140 which conceptually imitate a diffusion part for the variation around the mean @xmath141 and a drift part for the mean movement .",
    "apart from being mathematically clear and plausible from the classical donsker invariance principle , the meaningfulness of this limit shall moreover be confirmed by numerical analysis carried out partially in the final section and mainly in @xcite .",
    "let us drop a quick side remark : as a rough first approximation for @xmath137 we might also study the purely drift - like @xmath142 similar to but with scaling variable @xmath143 instead of @xmath7 as we now would like to keep @xmath7 fixed . in analogy to the law of large numbers",
    "this would lead to even nicer expressions and cpt dynamics but less faithful modelling ; sometimes we will consider it briefly for comparison reasons , cf .",
    "remark [ rem : drift - limit ] . it can be shown that all other types of scaling ( i.e. ,  others than @xmath144 or @xmath145 ) essential lead to either trivial or singular not well - defined expressions .",
    "we shall therefore stick to @xmath137 henceforth if not explicitly mentioned otherwise .",
    "moreover , it is clear that @xmath146 ( as @xmath33 is a group ) and hence @xmath147 .",
    "we have @xmath148 iff @xmath33 satisfies the decoupling condition for @xmath0 .",
