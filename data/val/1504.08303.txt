    "the vision of a quantum network integrates the concepts of classical communication with the potentialities of quantum physics , thereby opening up qualitatively new opportunities for data transmission and processing @xcite . for long - range information broadcasting in quantum networks ,",
    "the use of telecom fiber - compatible photons is highly desirable , due to the particular sensitivity of quantum information to loss . on the other hand",
    ", quantum information storage and processing makes use of optical transitions in atomic systems that often lie in the near - infrared ( nir ) region . in order to interface atom - based stationary quantum bits with flying qubits realized by telecom photons , quantum frequency conversion techniques between the respective wavelengths",
    "may be used @xcite .",
    "another attractive approach , as presented in the following , is to interface the two spectral regions by ( possibly entangled ) photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) @xcite .",
    "sources for photon pairs based on spdc are available at telecom @xcite and near infrared wavelengths @xcite , and also based on integrated optics technology @xcite .",
    "the spdc process , however , is intrinsically too broadband ( @xmath4100  ghz ) for compatibility with atomic transitions ( @xmath410  mhz ) .",
    "spectral shaping may either be achieved by external filtering @xcite , or one may use an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) approach , by embedding the spdc medium in an optical cavity .",
    "the latter was first demonstrated by ou and coworkers @xcite and also provides enhanced spdc efficiency .",
    "opo - based photon pair sources have been realized with bandwidths in the mhz range @xcite , and entangled photons compatible with atomic transitions in cs @xcite or rb @xcite and at telecom wavelengths @xcite have been generated .",
    "most of these sources generate frequency degenerate photon pairs in doubly resonant cavities ; spectral filtering of a non - degenerate opo was introduced recently to generate photon pairs compatible with quantum memories and telecom networks @xcite .    on the atomic side , trapped ca@xmath2-ions provide a paradigmatic platform for implementing fundamental components of quantum information applications @xcite . in the context of quantum networks , recent experiments showed the heralded absorption of single photons from a spdc source by a single ca@xmath2 ion @xcite , the manifestation of photonic entanglement in the absorption process @xcite , bidirectional atom - photon state conversion @xcite , and the interconnection of ions via photonic channels @xcite . here",
    "we report a photonic quantum interface based on an opo source of non - degenerate photon pairs that bridges the nir and telecom spectral regions and enables single - photon absorption in a ca@xmath2 ion heralded by a photon in the telecom range .",
    "the optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) is based on a design originally developed for experiments in quantum frequency conversion at telecom wavelengths @xcite .",
    "its heart is a 30  mm long crystal of periodically poled , mgo - doped stoichiometric lithium tantalate , whose end facets are cut under @xmath5 angle and anti - reflection coated for pump , signal , and idler wavelengths .",
    "its pump source is a frequency - doubled solid state laser system ( 532  nm , max .",
    "six equally spaced poling periods between @xmath6  @xmath7 m and @xmath8  @xmath7 m allow for opo operation anywhere between 1202  nm and 1564  nm idler wavelength and 806954  nm signal wavelength .",
    "the crystal is placed in a four - mirror bow - tie type ring cavity @xcite .",
    "three mirrors are coated for high reflectivity at 790995  nm and high transmission at the pump and idler wavelengths ; an output - coupling mirror with 97  % reflectivity at the signal wavelength allows us to operate the opo below threshold ( 2.8  w ) as a spdc - source of individual signal and idler photon pairs . for the experiments reported here we use 300  mw pump power , as a trade - off between high pair generation rate and low multi - pair probability .",
    "the opo covers the telecom o- , e- , s- and c - band and simultaneously the nir region where transitions of atoms and atom - like systems such as ca@xmath2 ( 854  nm ) , cs ( 894  nm ) , inas / gaas quantum dots ( 900 - 940  nm ) @xcite , or solid state quantum memories ( 883  nm ) @xcite are found .",
    "we expect the spectrum of the signal photons to be a convolution of the airy - function of the cavity with the phase matching function of the opo crystal .",
    "while the free spectral range of the cavity , @xmath9  ghz , is not resolved with our spectrometers , it is reflected in the temporal shape of the photon wave packet : if a photon pair is generated in the nonlinear crystal , the idler photon will leave the cavity immediately while the signal photon is likely to be reflected at the output coupling mirror . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempcoherence]a , the temporal correlation between idler and signal photon detection reveals the cavity round - trip and the cavity ring - down .",
    "an exponential fit to the envelope yields a cavity decay time of @xmath10  ns , corresponding to a linewidth of @xmath11  mhz .",
    "the well - separated peaks are spaced by the cavity round - trip time of @xmath12  ps .",
    "the width of these lines is resolution - limited due to detection jitter in the apds .",
    "[ fig : tempcoherence],scaledwidth=43.0% ]    to gain more insight into the photons spectral properties we measure the first - order coherence function of the signal field using a michelson interferometer . figure  [ fig : tempcoherence]b shows the interferogram ( visibility as a function of delay ) around zero delay . in the long - range scan ( main graph )",
    "peaks appear with a spacing of @xmath13  ps , confirming the previous result for the round trip time of the opo cavity .",
    "the inset shows a high - resolution scan ; a two - sided exponential fit yields 1.4  ps coherence time , which corresponds well to the measured spectral width of 275  ghz ( fwhm ) .",
    "this width is mainly determined by the phase matching conditions of the nonlinear process .",
    "the contrast and the comb structure visible in the temporal and coherence function are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction @xcite .    according to these results ,",
    "the width of a single mode from the comb - like spectrum is 7.2  mhz , already compatible with atomic resonances . to reduce the background from other , non - resonant modes , the resonant single line is extracted by narrowband filtering of the coincident idler photon that serves as a herald for its atom - resonant partner @xcite .",
    "as we target a transition in ca@xmath2 at 854  nm , the corresponding idler wavelength is at 1411  nm .",
    "we use a narrowband tunable filter system ( aos gmbh ) based on two cascaded fiber bragg gratings ( fbg ) .",
    "this device has a lorentzian transmission window of 1.56  ghz ( fwhm ) and a rejection band exceeding by far the phase matching spectrum .",
    "the filter system has 20  % maximum transmission , including coupling loss between the opo and a single mode fiber . as the filter width exceeds the opo free spectral range , neighbouring modes are",
    "also partially transmitted and will contribute a background of heralds that are not coincident with a resonant photon . from numerical calculations we expect a signal to background ratio around  1 .    to characterize the narrowband photon pairs",
    "we also filter the signal photons down to a single mode .",
    "the filter system is described in @xcite .",
    "it consists of two cascaded fabry - prot cavities with different free spectral ranges resulting in a transmission bandwidth of 22  mhz , tailored to match the linewidth of the d@xmath14p@xmath15 transition of the @xmath16ca@xmath17-ion at 854  nm . both filter cavities",
    "are actively stabilized to a laser which is resonant with the atomic transition .",
    "transmitted photons are detected by a si - apd .",
    "thus this filtering system serves to emulate the calcium transition of interest by detecting only photons from the resonant single mode of the opo spectrum .",
    "the result of the correlation measurement between filtered idler and signal photons is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlationfilter ] . the data is well described by a convolution of two exponential decays , as shown .",
    "the first time constant is the filter cavity decay time , 7.0  ns , while the second time constant corresponds to the width of the photon wave packet , @xmath18  ns , as determined above . since the loss factors between the opo and the two detectors",

    "a fiber beam splitter guides half of the 854  nm idler photons to the ion and the other half to the cavity filtering system described above .",
    "the detection rate behind the filter is utilized in a feedback loop to stabilize the center frequency of the opo against fluctuations and drifts due to environmental conditions .",

    "single - photon absorption is detected with about 94% efficiency , set by the branching fraction for decay of the p@xmath15 level to s@xmath19 .    in detail ,",

    "afterwards , a 2.2  @xmath7s long narrowband laser pulse at 729  nm transfers 99.2  % of the population to the @xmath21 state .",
    "three additional pulses clean out any remaining s@xmath19 population to other d@xmath14 sub - levels ; in total , preparation in d@xmath14 happens in 11  @xmath7s with 99.99  % probability .",
    "then the cooling lasers at 397  nm and 866  nm , driving the transitions s@xmath19p@xmath19 and d@xmath15p@xmath19 , respectively , are switched on , and the ion is exposed to the photons from the opo for 7  ms .",
    "ion - photon coupling is optimised by the use of a high - aperture laser objective ( halo ) .",
    "the fluorescence at 397  nm , whose onset serves as evidence for the absorption , is collected by two halos and detected by two photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) with 1.5% overall efficiency , resulting in 4.3  @xmath7s temporal resolution for the detection of a quantum jump . after the interaction time",
    "the sequence starts again .",
    "the probability for spontaneous decay from d@xmath14 to s@xmath19 during the interaction time is 0.6  % .    in parallel the telecom idler photons transmitted by the narrowband fbg filter",
