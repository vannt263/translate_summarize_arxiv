    "advancements in experimental techniques , in particular , the development of spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy ( sp - stm ) @xcite , has allowed the direct observation of magnetic structure of various nanosystems at the atomic scale .    _ ab initio _ calculations can greatly help understand the underlying physics behind observed phenomena , and can hint towards hitherto unnoticed features or direct attention to specific systems . by growing fe thin films epitaxially on various transition metal surfaces",

    "@xcite reveals that it is not a conventional spin spiral , since the spins follow a fanning path rather than a spiral along crystallographic directions .",
    "earlier theoretical investigations of the same system were based on total energy calculations , and considered only a few simple magnetic configurations @xcite .",
    "_ ab initio _",
    "methods demand huge computational effort and many aspects of noncollinear magnetism as well as finite temperature behaviour are too difficult to manage . by matching first principles calculations to classical spin models we may give a less fundamental , yet more tractable and more flexible description of magnetic systems .    in this work",
    "we investigate the fe@xmath0/rh(001 ) thin film in terms of a spin model consisting of tensorial heisenberg couplings , as well as higher order two - spin interactions , namely isotropic biquadratic terms .",
    "this research is a natural follow - up to our earlier study of the closely related fe / ir(001 ) thin films @xcite .",
    "we use the spin - cluster expansion ( sce ) combined with the relativistic disordered local moment ( rdlm ) theory @xcite to obtain model parameters .",
    "we also study the effect of layer relaxations on the magnetic interactions .",
    "the theoretical spin configuration is derived by solving the landau  lifshitz ",
    "gilbert equations at zero temperature .",
    "the highly collinear spin structure obtained due to very strong biquadratic interactions allows us to conclude that higher order multi - spin interactions are needed to describe properly the magnetism of this system .",
    "computations to obtain the magnetic structure of itinerant systems from first principles usually involve the adiabatic approximation , assuming a separation of time scales between fast ( electronic ) and slow ( spin ) degrees of freedom . in terms of the rigid spin approximation the orientational state of the spin system",
    "is specified by a set @xmath2 of unit vectors @xmath3 describing the orientation of the magnetization at site @xmath4 .",
    "we study magnetic thin film systems in terms of an extended tensorial heisenberg model of the form @xmath5 the traceless symmetric matrices @xmath6 describe the on - site anisotropy energy , whereas the exchange tensors @xmath7 can be decomposed as @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the unit matrix .",
    "these contributions can be easily interpreted , since @xmath10 is the isotropic heisenberg interaction ( note that according to a positive heisenberg coupling is ferromagnetic , i.e. , it favours parallel alignment of the interacting spins ) , the antisymmetric matrix @xmath11 corresponds to the dzyaloshinskii ",
    "moriya ( dm ) interaction @xcite , and @xmath12 describes the second order two - site anisotropy .",
    "the last term in describes the isotropic biquadratic interaction , with a positive coupling preferring collinear ( either parallel or antiparallel ) orientation .",
    "we use the spin - cluster expansion ( sce ) introduced originally by drautz and fhnle @xcite combined with the relativistic disordered local moment ( rdlm ) method @xcite implemented within the framework of the screened korringa  kohn",
    " rostoker ( skkr ) multiple scattering theory @xcite to obtain parameters for the spin model from first principles .",
    "the sce allows one to systematically expand the adiabatic magnetic energy surface of a spin system over a set of basis functions constructed from spherical harmonics , leading to a generalized spin model of the form @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 are real spherical harmonics and the summations exclude the constant spherical harmonic of composite quantum number @xmath15 .    on the one hand ,",
    "the coefficients of the sce spin model in can be related to those of the conventional spin hamiltonian in .",
    "for instance , the @xmath16 components of @xmath17 can be directly related to the @xmath7 tensor , and the isotropic biquadratic coupling can be expressed as @xcite @xmath18 on the other hand , orthonormality of the spherical harmonics implies that the function defined by can be projected to obtain the sce coefficients , e.g. @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the partial average of @xmath21 with fixed spin directions at site @xmath4 and @xmath22 .",
    "associating these averages of the spin model with the partially averaged _ ab initio _ grand potential allows us to extract interaction parameters from the electronic structure .",
    "the sce method is especially useful combined with rdlm theory , wherein partial averages of the grand potential can be directly calculated as opposed to using a huge number of individual electronic structure calculations to obtain the averages @xcite .",
    "while the method can be formulated to include multi - spin interactions with ease , the computation of such terms is currently beyond the capabilities of our computer code .",
    "once a set of model parameters is obtained , these may be used to determine the ground state magnetic configuration . to assess the magnetic ordering we use zero - temperature landau",

    "gilbert spin dynamics simulations as a means for energy minimization .",
    "the various terms of the spin model can be easily manipulated in these simulations , in particular to examine how the biquadratic couplings affect the ground state spin structure .    in our calculations",
    "the geometry consisted of a single layer of fe on a semi - infinite rh fcc-(001 ) substrate with a semi - infinite vacuum region on top , with an in - plane lattice constant of @xmath23   corresponding to the experimental value for bulk rh .",
    "layer relaxations were taken into account by varying the distance of the fe layer from the substrate . the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) of density functional theory",
    "was used according to the parametrization of vosko , wilk and nusair @xcite .",
    "the atomic sphere approximation was employed with an angular momentum cutoff of @xmath24 . for the computation of interaction parameters brillouin zone ( bz ) integrations were carried out with up to 2485 points in the irreducible wedge of the bz to ensure numerical precision . in spin",
    "dynamics simulations the initial state was random , and lattices consisting of @xmath25 sites were used with free boundary conditions , or @xmath26 in cases where the wavelength of the expected ground state ( based on the heisenberg interaction ) was comparable to the smaller system size .",
    "we performed self - consistent - field calculations for the fe monolayer on rh(001 ) for several values of the ( inward ) layer relaxation of the fe layer between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the experimental value @xcite .",
    "the fe local spin moment changes moderately from 2.93 @xmath30 to 2.84 @xmath30 in this relaxation range , with 2.87 @xmath30 for the experimental geometry .",
    "we found that in every case the on - site anisotropy is much smaller than the two - site contribution , and that the fe - fe interaction parameters show strong dependence on the layer relaxation , similar to our previous findings in fe@xmath0/ir(001 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to the smaller atomic number of rh with respect to ir , the relativistic interaction terms in the present system are smaller relative to the isotropic heisenberg couplings than in the case of ir substrate .    for a quantitative comparison of energy scales , the dominant value of each component of the heisenberg tensor is collected in table [ tab : coupling_magnitudes ] for a few fe layer relaxations . for @xmath27 , @xmath31 and @xmath29 relaxation the components of the first nearest neighbour ( nn ) , while for @xmath28 relaxation those of the second nn exchange tensor are shown , with the exception of the dm interaction magnitudes which are maximal for second nn s in every case . the isotropic heisenberg interaction clearly dominates among the bilinear terms , while by increasing the inward relaxation the dm interaction significantly increases .",
    "it should be noted , however , that while at smaller layer relaxations the isotropic terms are much larger than the dm interaction , for the experimental geometry and beyond there is only a factor of around 7 between the two contributions , implying that relativistic interactions have to be taken into account for a proper description of the system .",

    "the first nn values are furthermore only weakly sensitive to the layer relaxation , and their positive value implies that they prefer a collinear arrangement of interacting spins . for small relaxations",
    "the heisenberg terms most likely prefer fm ordering of the spins , which also complies with the weaker biquadratic terms .",
    "however , due to the comparative insensitivity of the biquadratic terms to relaxation , the bilinear and biquadratic couplings are of similar strength near the experimental relaxation .",
    "considering that the spin spiral states preferred by the frustrated heisenberg terms are incompatible with the biquadratic couplings of positive sign , we anticipate a very strong influence of biquadratic terms on the ground state spin structure due to this additional frustration , to be verified by spin dynamics simulations .",
    "for ideal geometry the ground state turned out to be indeed fm , with no frustration between the exchange interactions and the biquadratic terms .",
    "as the fe layer relaxation is increased , however , the competition between these two types of interactions and the frustration of the heisenberg couplings becomes pronounced , and the ground state is no longer fm .",
    "the change from fm ground state appears quite suddenly . at @xmath40 relaxation",
    "the ground state is still fm , while at @xmath41 the spin structure becomes a seemingly random collinear ensemble of up and down spins , indicating that the biquadratic coupling dominates the interaction landscape .",
    "figure [ fig : jiso_vs_bij ] suggests that since the magnitude of the biquadratic terms is weakly sensitive to fe layer relaxation , this rapid onset of a new type of ground state is due to the decrease of the first nn fm and the increase of second and third nn afm heisenberg couplings , leading to frustration of the exchange interactions .",
    "this qualitative picture holds true for larger relaxations including the experimental geometry .",
    "the exchange interactions by themselves would prefer some kind of spin spiral due to competing fm and afm couplings ( see figure [ fig : jiso_vs_bij ] ) .",
    "this frustration allows the comparatively strong first nn biquadratic couplings to overcome the bilinear terms , leading to the collinear spin structure shown in figure [ fig : expt - sd_sce ] for experimental geometry , as the biquadratic couplings with positive sign prefer a collinear , either parallel or antiparallel , orientation of interacting spins .    approximate ground state spin configuration simulated with spin - model parameters calculated for experimental geometry .",

    "the biquadratic terms themselves do not distinguish between parallel and antiparallel pairs of spins .",
    "omitting bilinear terms , the collinear ground state would be massively degenerate even for a given common axis of orientation , with spins pointing randomly along the common axis .",
    "even though the heisenberg terms can not destroy the collinear spin structure preferred by the biquadratic terms , they can lift the aforementioned degeneracy , appearing as a periodic modulation in the random collinear state of spins .    to trace this effect",
    "we computed the lattice fourier transform of the spin structures obtained from simulation , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of spins in the sample and @xmath45 is the unit vector describing the direction of the spin at site @xmath46 .",
    "the scalar quantity @xmath47 then plays the role of an indicator of any modulation with wave vector @xmath48 in the simulation . in figure",
    "[ fig : expt - fourier_sce ] this scalar is plotted in the entire bz for experimental geometry .",
    "while the value of @xmath49 is overall very small in the sample indicating that there are only weak correlations in the structure , there is a pattern emerging from the near - zero background in the shape of a rotated square .",
    "this is the additional modulation arising from the heisenberg interaction buried in the spin configuration .    to link the pattern seen in figure [ fig : expt - fourier_sce ] to the bilinear couplings we determined the spatial modulation preferred by them . to this end , we used a mean field estimate based on the @xmath50 paramagnetic spin susceptibility , given by @xmath51^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the temperature , @xmath53 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath54 is the lattice fourier transform of the exchange tensor @xcite .",
    "this formula implies that the highest temperature where the susceptibility is singular and , thus , a mean field estimate for the wave vector of the ordered state to which the paramagnetic state is unstable , is given by the global maximum of the eigenvalues of @xmath54 in the bz .",
    "the maximal eigenvalues , @xmath55 , of the @xmath54 matrices for experimental geometry are plotted in figure [ fig : expt - jq_sce ] .",
    "the similarity between the two quantities shown in figure [ fig : expt - four - jq ] is evident .",
    "the @xmath55 shows a shallow , nearly degenerate maximum line along a rounded circle , indicating that the ground state preferred by the heisenberg terms is somewhere along these @xmath56 points .",
    "it is clear that this maximum line fits perfectly to the fourier transform of the spin stucture in figure [ fig : expt - fourier_sce ] , verifying that the random collinear configuration forced by the biquadratic terms is further modulated by the bilinear interactions .",
    "the qualitative picture seen in figure [ fig : expt - four - jq ] is the same for every relaxation equal to or larger than @xmath41 .",
    "the sensitivity of the heisenberg terms to layer relaxation causes the @xmath55 surfaces to evolve somewhat with increasing inward relaxation , leading to a change in the weak modulation of the @xmath49 pattern .",
    "we also performed a set of spin dynamics simulations with the biquadratic terms artificially turned off .",
    "as expected , for the larger layer relaxation values the simulations evolved into clear single-@xmath56 helical spin spirals propagating along the @xmath57 direction , with wave vectors agreeing neatly with the numerical maxima of the corresponding @xmath55 surfaces , being @xmath58 for experimental geometry .",
    "the frustration arising from competing first and second nn heisenberg interactions is overall quite similar to what we found for the fe@xmath0/ir(001 ) system @xcite .",
    "in summary , we found that the ( bilinear ) exchange interactions in fe@xmath0/rh(001 ) depend strongly on the distance between the fe overlayer and the substrate , and that their competition leads to strong frustration near the experimental geometry , similarly to what was found in fe@xmath0/ir(001 ) @xcite .",
    "more importantly , we found that biquadratic couplings are comparable to the heisenberg terms , and even dominate those near the experimental geometry .",
    "consequently , for fe layer relaxations between @xmath41 and @xmath28 we obtained a complex collinear ground state spin structure from spin - dynamics simulations .",
    "the fact that the ` correction ' of the biquadratic terms to the second - order spin model drastically alters the ground state spin configuration implies that the usual anisotropic heisenberg model is insufficient to describe this system , and one should not even expect to reproduce experimental findings using this approximation .",
    "it is known that multi - spin interactions in small magnetic clusters can be at an energy scale comparable with the bilinear couplings @xcite .",
    "their inclusion into the mapping of _ ab initio _ total energy might significantly affect the computational estimates for heisenberg interactions @xcite .",
    "if strong enough , these terms can even influence the ground state spin configuration of magnetic monolayers @xcite , in extreme cases leading to the formation of exotic noncollinear spin structures such as nanoskyrmion lattices @xcite .    from the point of view of the sce , a complete second - order ( four - spin ) su(2)-invariant correction to the heisenberg model is given by a general energy term @xcite @xmath59 where the summations always run over sets of distinct sites .",
    "this would suggest that the biquadratic terms we chose to be included in are of the same importance as the three- and four - spin interactions .",
    "however , in the framework of the sce - rdlm method two - site interactions describe two electron propagations to lowest order , while three- and four - spin interactions need at least three and four propagations , respectively ( cf .  equations ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) in reference @xcite ) . due to the decay of the green s function with distance",
    ", this suggests that the biquadratic terms should , in general , be more important than multi - spin interactions , albeit the latter can easily be of the same magnitude as multiple - scattering corrections to the former .",
    "all things considered , the spin structures obtained with our simulations are still very unlikely especially with regard to experiments , suggesting that even with the inclusion of the isotropic biquadratic terms we are far from grasping the true magnetic ground state of the system . as for the spin configuration observed in the experiment , upon closer examination one may realize that the @xmath1 period in reference @xcite does not correspond to a single-@xmath56 spin spiral .",
    "a lattice fourier transform of the proposed configuration seems to show modulations corresponding to three distinct , symmetry unrelated wave vectors , namely @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this fact is in accordance with our findings , in that it seems improbable to be defined by the ground state of a simple heisenberg model .",
