    "the determination of the black hole spin is one of the most intriguing issues in astrophysics .",
    "knowledge of the spin sheds light on the evolution of x - ray binary systems ( xrbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite , and it allows to assess the role of the black hole angular momentum in the formation of relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to determine the spin of a black hole .",
    "the two most reliable methods to date are fitting the broad fe k@xmath0 line from reflected emission @xcite and fitting the continuum emission @xcite .",
    "further ways to estimate the black hole spin include x - ray timing , i.e. the modeling of high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( hfqpos ) @xcite and x - ray polarimetry of the inner disk region @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of these four methods can be found in the review by @xcite . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the problems connected to the continuum - fitting method .",
    "spin measurements for a number of ( mostly ) galactic xrb sources based on the continuum - fitting method are available in the literature , for instance for grs  1915 + 105 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and lmc  x-3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , two sources that attain very high luminosities .",
    "the method was also successfully used in the case of the weak line quasar sdss j094533.99 + 100950.1 @xcite , the radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy rx j1633 + 4718 @xcite , and several other intermediate redshift quasars @xcite .    despite the overall success of the continuum - fitting method ,",
    "one fundamental problem remains unsolved , namely the apparent dependence of the spin on the source luminosity . during an outburst , xrbs go through the high / soft state where their spectra are dominated by emission that peaks at soft x - ray energies .",
    "this peak can be modeled by a multi - color blackbody disk .",
    "thermal spectra with a disk flux contribution above @xmath1 to the total flux are suitable for the analysis .",
    "the continuum - fitting method compares the observed shape of the thermal continuum spectrum to an accretion disk model spectrum .",
    "a sequence of such thermal state spectra have been modeled , e.g. for grs  1915 + 105 @xcite . there , the fits resulted in a black hole spin that was significantly decreasing with the modeled disk luminosity above @xmath2 , where @xmath3 erg / s .",
    "a plausible explanation is that the assumptions underlying the disk model in @xcite break down at higher eddington ratios .",
    "the standard accretion model describes an optically thick and geometrically razor thin ( @xmath4 ) gas disk that reaches all the way down to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) and efficiently emits at each annulus . with increasing mass accretion rate",
    "the standard disk is unable to cool efficiently .",
    "as the disk overheats , it expands vertically to scale heights that are not consistent with the initial assumptions anymore and a significant fraction of energy is advected inward .",
    "the disk structure is then better described by the slim disk model , which has a radiative efficiency that decreases with increasing mass accretion rate .",
    "the corresponding analysis has been done , e.g. for lmc  x-3 .",
    "the estimated black hole spin , however , _ still _ decreases with luminosity also for the advective slim disk .",
    "there are two reasons which could explain this apparent decrease in the spin .",
    "the first one is the description of the disk atmosphere .",
    "radiative transfer in the disk atmosphere is usually incorporated in accretion disk spectral models via the tlusty code @xcite which locally computes absorption opacities of various chemical elements in plane - parallel layers . in the x - ray spectral fitting software xspec @xcite a well known and widely used thin disk model with full radiative",
    "transfer is bhspec @xcite , while slim disks with full radiative transfer are available as slimbh .",
    "however , the physics of the disk atmosphere is very complicated and largely unknown , with magnetic fields , turbulent stress , and dissipation taking place ( see e.g * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this manifests in the fact that both bhspec and slimbh seem to overestimate the amount of photons at the spectral peak .",
    "the second reason is mass - loss due to winds / outflows from the disk surface . in general , outflows are thought to become significant when the mass accretion rate through the disk increases as discussed in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "outflowing winds have recently been detected in several xrbs and agns via blueshifted x - ray absorption lines which are observed in high resolution spectra , for instance in grs  1915 + 105 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gro j1655@xmath540 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and pg 1211 + 143 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the present paper",
    "we perform simple estimates to check whether a wind scenario is likely to be responsible for the observed apparent spin decrease over luminosity .",
    "given the fact that spin measurements from both thin and slim disks show the same type of deviation we use the mathematically simpler standard @xcite model to describe the underlying accretion disk .",
    "we then modify the mass accretion rate to incorporate mass loss due to an unspecified wind and calculate the energy spectra of such flows . in sec .",

    "the apparent decrease of the black hole spin with increasing source luminosity reported in grs  1915 + 105 and lmc  x-3 is significant in both cases . for this reason the disk",
    "is usually assumed to be reliably optically thick and geometrically thin only for modeled disk luminosities in the range @xmath6 . in the relativistic standard model @xcite ,",
    "the apparent decline of spin with luminosity can be directly translated into a decreasing accretion efficiency , @xmath7 .",
    "we now postulate that ( i ) this decrement in spin roots in the existence of wind and that ( ii ) the amount of energy driven away by this wind corresponds to the drop in accretion efficiency .",

    "we adopt throughout the paper the above quoted dynamical parameters for lmc  x-3 and grs  1915 + 105 and the respective mean spin values which we found using the slim disk model .",
    "in this section we introduce a simple parametric description of the wind .",
    "first , we concentrate on the effect the wind has on the intrinsic shape of the thermal emission from an accretion disk .",
    "we describe the wind as a radially dependent quantity that decreases the accretion rate towards the black hole . in the following calculations we adopt the code by @xcite which is based on @xcite and neglects self - irradiation of the disk as well as comptonization in the disk atmosphere .",
    "moreover , we assume that the disk thickness is small so that the photons are emitted from the equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "therefore , the local disk emissivity is independent of any assumptions about the disk s vertical structure , including viscosity . we assume zero torque at the isco .",
    "the wind from the accretion disk surface that is required to cause the apparent change in the measured spin must have the appropriate radial distribution . since the observed x - ray emission comes predominantly from the innermost tens of gravitational radii , the type of wind that can solve the spin drop problem must be localized there .",
    "there are a number of ways to describe the mass loss due to wind .",
    "we define @xmath31 and @xmath32 as the accretion rates at the inner and outer disk radius , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the inflow at a given radius , @xmath37 , and total mass loss beyond this radius , respectively .",
    "we consider several wind models and calculate their spectra for a range of accretion rates @xmath32 and fixed spin parameter @xmath13 .",
    "then , we fit the emergent spectra using the relativistic standard model @xcite _ without _ any wind , leaving accretion rate @xmath38 and spin @xmath39 as free parameters .",

    "accretion disks that self - consistently include winds are thus much less efficient at converting mass into radiation than a standard thin disk .",
    "the spectral difference in the shape between the models with and without wind is very small , when the model parameters are appropriately adjusted . in a given observation ,",
    "the spin , accretion rate , and wind prescription are strongly degenerate .",
    "they are additionally masked by the comptonization at higher energies .",
    "a sequence of disk - dominated spectra is necessary , since then the spin should remain the same , independently from the source luminosity . models without wind and with hardening factor taken from bhspec do not provide the correct solution for such a sequence for grs  1915 + 105 and lmc  x-3 , while the wind model presented in this paper is satisfactory .",
    "the comparison of the disk wind model with the data is a first step towards the assessment of the flow geometry .",
    "however , next steps are very difficult , since the material removed from the disk flows out as a wind but also ( mostly ) flows in as a corona flow .",
    "comptonization computations should be done in 3-d , for the adopted flow pattern .",
    "the basic difficulty is that we then need to know the temperature distribution inside the hot flow which depends on the plausible local dissipation , and the global magnetic field will affect the global flow .",
    "the success of the wind model in reproducing the right trends over a range of mass accretion rates does not mean that the wind is the only solution to the spin problem .",
    "have shown that if a constant hardening factor is used instead of a variable hardening factor predicted by bhspec and slimbh , the spin problem is significantly alleviated .",
    "we find that fits with slimbh are just as good as those with diskw and , consequently , that the rxte data are not sensitive to the shape of the disk model spectrum .",
    "@xcite is a satellite that has a moderate spectral resolution ccd for the 0.7 - 10 kev band and a hard x - ray detector for the 12 - 30 kev band . @xcite",
    "used _ suzaku _ observations of lmc  x-3 to constrain the spectral shape of the intrinsic disk emission in various models .",
    "they found that bhspec which self - consistently includes radiative transfer through the vertical structure of the disk gives an excess at the absorption edge energy below 1 kev compared to the data .",
    "this may suggest the need to include more physical processes in the disk atmosphere , i.e. atomic physics and better assumptions for the disk density and emissivity profile with respect to the disk height .",
    "one way to prove the physical existence of the wind close to the black hole horizon would be to see it directly in the spectral shape of the pure disk component , due to general relativity effects .",
    "however , this would require a data set with very low systematic errors , below 0.2% .",
    "in addition , the precision in the description of the comptonization process would also matter in this case , including the 3-d distribution of the static comptonizing medium and taking into account the material motion would pose yet another challenge @xcite .",
    "outflows are expected and actually observed in accreting systems .",
    "their occurrence in the form of collimated jets is characteristic of low eddington rate sources .",
    "while jets seem to be suppressed in the high / soft state of black hole xrbs @xcite , uncollimated outflows / winds are still found in high luminosity sources @xcite . however , the presence of the specific outflow we request here to solve the problem of the apparent spin decrease is difficult to test",
    ". the outflow temperature must be at least @xmath264 k or higher and the outflow may , or may not , be located along the line of sight , depending on the collimation which is unspecified .",
    "the material is thus highly , or fully ionized leaving only a possibility of emission / absorption from highly ionized iron .",
    "there are ample observational evidences for outflows from accretion disks .",
    "outflowing winds have recently been detected in several xrbs via blueshifted x - ray absorption lines which are observed in high resolution spectra ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . with modeling the observed narrow absorption features recorded in grs  1915 + 105 by chandra hetgs ( high energy transmission grating spectra ) , the total mass outflow rate is estimated to be comparable to the mass accretion rate in the inner part of the disk @xcite .",
    "a re - analysis of the chandra hetgs spectroscopy data of grs  1915 + 105 by @xcite with improved multi - zone photoionization models and with different ionization parameters and velocities reveals that @xmath265 when the accreted gas rate @xmath266 , where the eddington accretion rate in that work is defined as : @xmath267 .",
    "these detected winds , however , clearly do not correspond to the winds requested in our paper to solve the problem of the apparent spin evolution .",
    "our winds should happen very close to the black hole , at a few gravitational radii , and with the terminal speed of the order of the local keplerian velocity at these radii , i.e. at a large fraction of the light speed .",
    "all winds discussed above show narrow absorption features with shifts corresponding to a few hundreds to a few thousands km s@xmath268 , e.g. , 4u  1630@xmath5472 : the velocity @xmath269 and the launching radius @xmath270 ;",
    "gro  j1655@xmath540 : @xmath271 and @xmath272 ; h  1743@xmath5322 : @xmath273 and @xmath274 ; grs  1915 + 105 : @xmath275 and @xmath276 ( see table 4 - 6 and 12 of * ? ? ?",
    "thus , observations usually give constraints on the partially ionized winds from the outer disk while here we deal with the highly ionized winds from the inner disk .",
    "magnetically driven outflows have been postulated and studied from a theoretical point of view ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and efficient outflow close to the inner disk radius due to the bending of the poloidal field is expected @xcite .",
    "observationally , magnetic assistance has been advocated in some outflows , like ultra - fast outflows in active galaxies .",
    "ultra - fast outflows have been detected in a number of agn through the analysis of absorptions features . for example , in pg 1211 + 143 @xcite identified highly ionized outflows which had a velocity of @xmath277 and mass flux comparable to the mass accretion rate . a more recent spectral analysis of xmm - newton / epic data of pg  1211 + 143 revealed an outflow velocity of @xmath278 , with most of the wind launched at 200 @xmath14 and an inner wind truncation radius of @xmath279 @xcite , which favors magnetic driving .",
    "the location of this wind , however , is still too far from the black hole for our purpose . in principle",
    ", the motion of the plasma is encoded in the way how a fully ionized plasma up - scatters the photons .",
    "since the terminal outflow velocities are large while the initial denser part of the wind has a lower velocity , the expected effects of the bulk comptonization are difficult to model , without assuming a specific velocity profile .",
    "the issues of bulk comptonization were occasionally discussed both in the case of an inflow ( e.g. chakrabarty & titarchuk 1995 ; liu et al .",
    "2015 ) and an outflow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "computations of the comptonization of the disk photons in the postulated winds with density / velocity / temperature gradients is beyond the scope of the present simple work .",
    "the determination of the black hole spin in xrbs using advanced fully relativistic disk models including full radiative transfer to account for comptonization in the disk atmosphere leads to a paradox : the spin decreases with increasing source luminosity . here",
    ", we analyze whether this effect might be explained by the presence of the winds from the innermost part of the accretion disk .",
    "we find that relatively smooth radial winds without explicit dependence on mass accretion rate ( models ( 1)-(3 ) in sec .",
    "[ sec : flow ] ) do not provide the solution for this effect .",
    "however , if we assume in model @xmath280 that parameter @xmath54 depends on @xmath32 ( the mass accretion rate at the outer disk radius ) the apparent spin decrease can be reproduced ( green stars in fig .",
    "[ fig:1915 ] ) .",
    "we can recover the observed trend also in model  ( 4 ) where the truncated inner disk radius depends linearly on @xmath32 .",
    "the physical interpretation of such a model is that either most of the material , or at least most of the energy and angular momentum , has to be removed from the disk in a form of a wind or an uncollimated jet , leaving behind a cold non - radiating flow close to the black hole horizon .    in all these scenarios",
    "the shape of the thermal disk component is modified , leaving a trace of the process in the spectral shape .",
    "we show that the spectra for the two cases of outflow discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : comp ] , namely the hot optically thin and the cold optically thick wind , are in comparison to a spectrum without comptonization either visibly harder or softer , respectively . however , if the comptonizing medium is chosen independently from the predicted outflow , the difference between the model with , and without outflow is very small , @xmath281 at the energy where the disk flux before comptonization drops by a factor of two below the peak flux ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spectra2 ] ) .",
    "we test in more detail the disk - wind scenario against the data for two bright xrbs , lmc  x-3 and grs  1915 + 105 , using the model @xmath280 and assuming a comptonizing medium surrounding the disk . for each source",
    "we fit several hundreds of high / soft spectra assuming an intrinsically constant black hole spin and the presence of the wind that correlates with mass accretion rate .",
    "we obtain good fit statistics as demonstrated for four representative spectra for each source ( figures  [ fig : lmcx3_fit ] , [ fig : grs1915_fit ] and tables  [ tab : lmcx3_result ] , [ tab : grs1915_result ] ) .",
    "the apparent decrease of the black hole spin over a range of mass accretion rates in lmc  x-3 and grs  1915 + 105 could originate from the presence of wind or be a consequence of an incomplete description of the disk atmosphere .",
    "the latter issue will be addressed in a forthcoming paper . here",
    ", we show that the wind model with a fixed spin can fit the data .",
    "however , the implied properties of the comptonizing medium do not correlate with the required wind , as the wind intensity rises sharply with the luminosity while the comptonizing medium properties remain almost unchanged .",
    "this implies the presence of a separate comptonizing medium , likely in the form of an x - ray source located on the symmetry axis , while the material removed from the disk , albeit in large amount , can escape detection if it flows predominantly inward as a corona flow .",
    "thus we have no direct observational evidence of the requested wind from the inner few gravitational radii .",
