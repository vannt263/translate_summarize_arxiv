    "white dwarf ( wd ) cosmochronology provides an independent and accurate age dating method for different galactic populations @xcite . using 43 cool wds in the solar neighborhood , @xcite derived a disk age of 8 @xmath7 1.5 gyr .",
    "@xcite and @xcite significantly improved the field wd sample by using sdss and usno - b astrometry to select high proper motion candidates .",
    "however , their survey suffered from the magnitude limit of the palomar observatory sky survey plates and they were unable to find many thick disk or halo wd candidates .",
    "substantial investment of the @xmath8 time on two globular clusters , m4 and ngc 6397 , revealed clean wd cooling sequences . @xcite and",
    "@xcite use these data to derive cooling ages of @xmath9 gyr for the two clusters .",
    "the coolest wds in these clusters are about 650 @xmath7 230 k cooler than the coolest wds in the disk @xcite .",
    "these studies demonstrate that the galactic halo is older than the disk by @xmath10 gyr @xcite .",
    "even though the wds in globular clusters provide reliable age estimates , these clusters may not represent the full age range of the galactic halo . the required exposure times to reach the wd terminus in globular clusters limit these studies to the nearest few clusters .",
    "in addition , only two - filter ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) photometry is used to model the absolute magnitude and color distribution of the oldest wds to derive ages .",
    "the far closer and brighter wds of the local halo field are an enticing alternative as well as complementary targets , with the additional potential to constrain the age range of the galactic halo .",
    "accurate ages for field wds can be obtained through optical and near - infrared photometry and trigonometric parallax measurements .",
    "nearby wds can also be used to understand the model uncertainties and put the globular cluster ages on a more secure footing .",
    "the quest for field halo wds has been hampered by the lack of proper motion surveys that go deep enough to find the cool halo wds .",
    "the initial claims for a significant population of halo wds in the field @xcite and in the hubble deep field @xcite were later rejected by detailed model atmosphere analysis ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and additional proper motion measurements @xcite . to date , the coolest known probable halo wds are wd 0346 + 246 @xcite and sdss j1102 + 4113 , with @xmath13 k @xcite .",
    "there are also about a dozen ultracool wds detected in the sdss @xcite that may be thick disk or halo wds , but current wd atmosphere models have problems in reproducing their intriguing spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "therefore , their temperatures and ages remain uncertain .    here",
    "we report the identification of three old halo wd candidates discovered as part of our bok and usno proper motion survey .",
    "the details of this survey and our follow - up observations are discussed in section 2 , whereas our model fits and analysis are discussed in section 3 .",
    "in january 2006 , we started an @xmath14band second - epoch astrometry survey with the steward observatory bok 90-inch telescope with its 90prime camera @xcite .",
    "the 90prime provides a field of view of 1.0 square degree with 0.45@xmath15 pixel@xmath1 resolution .",
    "since 2009 additional observations have been obtained with the u.s .",
    "naval observatory flagstaff station 1.3 m telescope using the ccd mosaic camera ( 1.4 square degree field of view with 0.6@xmath15 pixel@xmath1 resolution ) .",
    "we limited our program to the sdss data release 3 footprint in order to have a relatively long time - baseline between our program and the sdss observations .",
    "we obtain proper motion errors of roughly 20 mas yr@xmath1 at @xmath16 mag ( @xmath17 mag for cool wds ) .",
    "we select candidates for follow - up spectroscopy based on our proper motion measurements and the photometric colors .",
    "we further limit our sample to objects with high proper motion and relatively red colors in order to find the elusive thick disk and halo wds .",
    "we started the follow - up optical spectroscopy of candidate halo wds at the 6.5 m mmt equipped with the blue channel spectrograph in june 2009 . here",
    "we present low resolution spectroscopy of three halo wd candidates with @xmath18 mag .",
    "these observations were performed on ut 2009 june 19 - 21 .",
    "our targets are sdss j213730.87 + 105041.6 , j214538.16 + 110626.6 , and j214538.60 + 110619.0 ( hereafter j2137 + 1050 , j2145 + 1106n , and j2145 + 1106s , respectively ) .",
    "we used a 1.25@xmath15 slit and the 500 line mm@xmath1 grating in first order to obtain spectra with wavelength coverage @xmath19   and a resolving power of @xmath20 1200 .",
    "the @xmath21band magnitudes of our targets range from 21.0 to 21.8 mag , and the exposure times range from 60 to 100 min .",
    "we obtained all spectra at the parallactic angle and acquired he ",
    "ar  ne comparison lamp exposures for wavelength calibration .",
    "we use the observations of the spectrophotometric standard star g24 - 9 , which is also a cool wd , for flux calibration .",
    "in addition , we obtained @xmath22 and @xmath23band imaging observations of our targets using the mmt and magellan infrared spectrograph ( mmirs ; * ? ? ? * ) on the mmt on ut 2009 sep 2 and 4 .",
    "the fwhm of the images range from 0.8@xmath15 to 1.3@xmath15 .",
    "we use a 1.0@xmath15 or 1.4@xmath15 aperture for photometry .",
    "the @xmath24 field of view of mmirs enables us to use 20 - 50 nearby 2mass stars to calibrate the photometry .",

    "we use the corrections given in @xcite to convert the sdss photometry to the ab system .",
    "two of our targets , j2145 + 1106n and s ( n - for north and s - for south ) , are separated by 10@xmath15 and they have proper motions consistent within the errors .",

    "however , hydrogen can still show its presence through the red wing of ly @xmath43 absorption @xcite in the blue and through collision - induced absorption due to molecular hydrogen in the infrared @xcite .",
    "cool helium atmosphere wds do not suffer from these opacities , and they are expected to show seds similar to blackbodies @xcite . therefore , ultraviolet and near - infrared data are crucial for determining the atmospheric composition of cool wds",

    "since parallax measurements are unavailable , we assume a surface gravity of @xmath45 g = 8 ( @xmath46 ) . we discuss the implications of this mass assumption in section 4.2 .    we find that the observed seds of our targets are best matched by pure hydrogen atmosphere models .",
    "figure 1 presents the observed and best - fit seds for our targets assuming a pure hydrogen atmosphere composition .",
    "the temperatures for these models range from 3730 to 4110 k. the seds peak around 1 @xmath47 m . even though the optical portion of the seds may be explained by simple blackbodies ,",

    "the pure hydrogen atmosphere models match the ultraviolet , optical , and near - infrared seds of our targets fairly well .",
    "the fits for j2137 + 1050 and j2145 + 1106n are similar to the fits obtained for the halo wd candidate sdss j1102 + 4113 @xcite .",
    "there are slight differences between the observations and these models .",
    "the synthetic @xmath48band fluxes seem lower than observed and there are related problems with matching the @xmath49 and @xmath22 band fluxes .",
    "systematic problems most likely exist for models below 4000 k. the models for the two coolest stars predict absorption bumps around 1 @xmath47 m .",
    "these bumps have never been observed in the spectra of real wds , indicating that the current collision - induced opacity calculations may be problematic for high - density atmospheres of cool wds ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nevertheless , the overall seds of our targets agree with model predictions over the entire @xmath50 m range .",
    "addition of helium can improve the model fits slightly .",
    "figure 2 shows the best - fit models assuming pure h , pure he , and mixed h / he composition . since mixed h / he atmospheres have higher pressure than pure h atmospheres at the same temperature , the collision - induced absorption is expected to be stronger .",
    "addition of 4 - 16% helium ( relative to hydrogen ) into the atmosphere helps with fitting the infrared portion of the seds .",
    "however , these fits are marginally better than the pure hydrogen atmosphere model fits , and they are not statistically significant .",
    "the best - fit temperature values are also similar to the pure hydrogen atmosphere solutions .",
    "hence , the choice of a pure hydrogen or mixed h / he composition with small amounts of helium does not significantly change our results . in any case , the good match between the optical spectrum and the models including ly @xmath43 absorption indicates that these wds have hydrogen - dominated atmospheres ; helium - dominated or highly helium - enriched atmospheres are ruled out ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the temperature , wd cooling age , and distance estimates for our targets based on pure hydrogen atmosphere models with @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) and the cooling models by @xcite are given in table 1 .",
    "this mass assumption implies that our targets are located at 70 - 80 pc away from the sun , and the wd cooling ages are 8.7 gyr or longer .",
    "our model fits to the individual seds give cooling ages of 8.7 - 9.7 gyr and distances of 69 and 70 pc for the members of the j2145 + 1106 common proper motion system .",
    "the difference in cooling ages can be explained by a small mass difference between the two stars .",
    "these results suggest that j2145 + 1106 system is a physical binary and that our model fits are reliable .",
    "based on our proper motion measurements and assuming zero radial velocity , we also estimate the tangential velocity and galactic @xmath6 velocities for our targets .",
    "these wds display tangential velocities of 140 - 200 km s@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite emphasize the importance of determining total stellar ages in order to associate any wd with thick disk or halo .",
    "modelling the optical and near - ir seds of the @xcite wd sample , @xcite find that many of the wds in that sample are fairly warm and too young to be halo wds unless they all have masses near 0.5 @xmath53 .",
    "they find that , with estimated temperatures of 3950 - 4100 k and ages of 8.8 - 9.1 gyr , f351@xmath2850 and wd 0351@xmath28564 are the two most likely halo candidates in the @xcite sample .    for an average mass of 0.58 @xmath53 , our temperature estimates corresponds to wd cooling ages of 9.6 - 9.7 gyr for j2137 + 1050 and j2145 + 1106n .",
    "these two stars are the coolest field wds currently known .",
    "although the ultracool wds discovered by @xcite and @xcite are possibly cooler than our targets , current models have problems explaining the observed seds of these wds @xcite . using the initial - final mass relations of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , we estimate that a 0.58 @xmath53 wd would be the descendant of a @xmath54 star .",
    "such a progenitor halo star has a main - sequence lifetime of 1.0 - 1.3 gyr @xcite .",
    "therefore , the total ages of our 3 targets range from 9.7 to 11.0 gyr ; they most likely belong to the halo or thick disk .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of three nearby old halo white dwarf candidates in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , including two stars in a common proper motion binary system . </S>",
    "<S> these candidates are selected from our 2800 square degree proper motion survey on the bok and u.s . naval observatory flagstaff station 1.3 m telescopes , and they display proper motions of @xmath0 yr@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> follow - up mmt spectroscopy and near - infrared photometry demonstrate that all three objects are hydrogen - dominated atmosphere white dwarfs with @xmath2 k. for average mass white dwarfs , these temperature estimates correspond to cooling ages of @xmath3 gyr , distances of @xmath4 pc , and tangential velocities of @xmath5 km s@xmath1 . based on the @xmath6 space velocities , we conclude that they most likely belong to the halo . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the combined main - sequence and white dwarf cooling ages are 10 - 11 gyr . along with sdss j1102 + 4113 , they are the oldest field white dwarfs currently known . </S>",
    "<S> these three stars represent only a small fraction of the halo white dwarf candidates in our proper motion survey , and they demonstrate that deep imaging surveys like the pan - starrs and large synoptic survey telescope should find many old thick disk and halo white dwarfs that can be used to constrain the age of the galactic thick disk and halo . </S>"
