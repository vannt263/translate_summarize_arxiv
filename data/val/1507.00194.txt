    "in the jaynes - cummings model , a single atomic dipole interacting with a single photon of an electromagnetic field mode in a cavity periodically exchanges the excitation between the electronic and photonic degree of freedom . in this letter",
    "we ask ourselves : how does this behavior change , when the cavity s mirrors are not fixed , but can move in time as an additional quantum dynamical degree of freedom ? how does the quantumness of the mirror motion manifest itself in the dynamics ? and , what happens if several photons are present in the cavity field ?    the recent experimental success in cavity optomechanics  @xcite , notably the demonstration of laser cooling of the cavity s mirror motion towards the ground state of the confining harmonic potential , pioneers near - future experiments with extended , hybrid systems .",
    "an obvious extension of the paradigmatic optomechanical system , i.e an optical cavity coupled to a mechanical element by radiation forces whose motion changes the cavity s boundaries , can be achieved by adding a single two - level system which couples to the cavity light field by dipole interaction , thereby combining cavity optomechanics with cavity quantum electrodynamics . besides conventional quantum electrodynamics experiments with macroscopic cavities investigations of such systems are of particular importance for solid - state systems , such as two - level systems in optomechanical crystals  @xcite . in circuit",
    "electromechanical setups the coupling to two - level systems has already been demonstrated  @xcite .    especially solid - state systems ( leaving aside the two - level system in contemporary realizations ) are candidates for reaching the so - called single - photon strong coupling regime  @xcite , where the radiation force of a single photon is strong enough to displace the harmonically oscillating mechanical element by more than the extension of its ground state wave packet .",
    "this regime is entered , when the mechanical frequency becomes much smaller than the optomechanical coupling .",
    "then , the non - linearity of the radiation force becomes clearly apparent and manifests itself in phenomena like the photon blockade effect  @xcite , which is caused by an effective photon - photon interaction mediated by the mechanical degree of freedom .",
    "when adding a single atom to the optomechanical cavity , the resulting hybrid system does not only reflect the radiation forces of the cavity - mirror interaction , but also includes the dipole interaction between a near - resonant atomic transition and the cavity field , drastically altering the dynamics as a whole .",
    "the richness in the dynamics of such a highly non - linear system has been started to be explored in several general investigations of its coherent motion  @xcite and can be exploited to prepare non - classical states , similar as in nonlinear optical setups  @xcite . in this letter",
    "we focus on the possibility to dynamically suppress the rabi oscillation of the atomic population due to the mirror motion .",
    "the idea behind can best be illustrated having a classical picture in mind , i.e. when the mirror is moving parametrically along a given trajectory .",
    "then , an initially tuned atom - cavity interaction becomes disturbed by the mirror motion due to the change of the cavity s resonance frequency being a function of the cavity length .",
    "if the mirror elongation is large enough , the modified atom - cavity detuning can lead to reduced rabi oscillations of the quantum electrodynamic subsystem .",
    "we will develop this simple classical picture beyond the trivial parametric motion towards a fully dynamical one in the quantum regime .",
    "the wigner function will be used to represent the dynamics of the mechanical degree of freedom , which can exhibit strong non - classical characteristics deep in the non - linear parameter regime .",
    "even when dissipation and variation of the initial state is included , characteristic features of the suppression can be distinguished .",
    "we consider an optomechanical resonator with a two - level atom placed at a fixed position within the resonator .",
    "the transition frequency between the ground state @xmath0 and the excited state @xmath1 is assumed to be resonant with the frequency @xmath2 of the cavity when its end mirror is in its equilibrium position .",
