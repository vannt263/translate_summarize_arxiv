    "coherent manipulation of quantum states is a critical step toward many novel technological applications ranging from manipulation of qubits in quantum logic gates@xcite to controlling the reaction pathways of molecules . in the field of the quantum state control by optical means ,",
    "both rabi oscillation and quantum interference play the central roles .",
    "the exciton rabi splitting was observed in the luminescence spectrum of a single ingaas quantum dot and the exciton rabi oscillation was also observed in the spectroscopy of a single gaas or ingaas quantum dot @xcite .",
    "the two - qubit crot ( controlled rotation ) gate operation was demonstrated using two orthogonally polarized exciton states and a biexciton state in a gaas quantum dot@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , the decoherence / dephasing times of excitons and biexcitons in these quantum dots are limited by the radiative lifetimes(@xmath0 1 ns ) even at low temperatures .",
    "thus a qubit with a longer decoherence time is desirable for the application to the quantum information processing .",
    "electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) are considered as one of the most promising candidates of the building blocks for quantum information processing@xcite due to their robustness against decoherence effects@xcite . in double qd systems , initialization and coherent manipulation of the electron spin",
    "have been realized , with coherence times extending to @xmath1s@xcite .",
    "recently , a quantum media converter from a photon qubit to an electron spin qubit was proposed for quantum repeaters@xcite .",
    "quantum information can take several different forms and it is preferable to be able to convert among different forms .",
    "one form is the photon polarization and another is the electron spin polarization .",
    "photons are the most convenient medium for sharing quantum information between distant locations .",
    "however , it is necessary to realize a quantum repeater in order to send the information securely over a very long distance overcoming the photon loss .",
    "a quantum repeater requires two essential ingredients , namely , the quantum state transfer between a photon and an electron spin and the correlation ( bell ) measurement between two electrons created by the quantum state transfer from two different photons .",
    "additionally it is desirable to have a long - lived quantum memory based on the nuclear spins . for the quantum state transfer , a strained ingaas /",
    "inp quantum dot was proposed as a preferable device based on the @xmath2-factor engineering@xcite . in the actual operation ,",
    "the photoexcited holes are to be quickly swept out of the quantum dot to project the photon polarization onto the electron spin polarization , preserving the quantum coherence .",
    "we have analyzed the performance of this operation and clarified the conditions to be satisfied to achieve a high value of the purity of the transferred quantum state or the fidelity of the quantum state transfer .",
    "another fundamental element for realizing the quantum repeater is the bell ( quantum correlation ) measurement for the entanglement swapping . in our case",
    "this measurement is carried out for two electrons which are created by the quantum state transfer from two separate photons . here",
    "we propose an optical method to do this bell measurement based on the faraday ( in the transmission geometry ) or kerr ( in the reflection geometry ) rotation and estimate the feasibility .",
    "the electron spin decoherence time reported so far for low temperatures is about a few microsecond and is not sufficiently long for the secure quantum information processing . thus the nuclear spin quantum memory will be eventually required and the robust quantum state transfer should be realized between the electron spin and the nuclear spins in order to store and retrieve the quantum information . for that purpose , the fundamental features of dynamics in the electron - nuclei coupled system should be investigated . here",
    "we reveal a sequence of back - actions between the electron spin and the nuclear spins through the quantum state measurements and predict a couple of new phenomena .",
    "these findings will open the way to realize the quantum state purification of nuclear spins , elongation of the electron spin decoherence time and the nuclear spin quantum memory .",
    "in the quantum state transfer between the photon qubit and the electron qubit , the one - to - one correspondence should be established between the photon polarization and the electron spin polarization . in other words , the one - to - one correspondence between the poincare sphere for a photon and the bloch sphere for an electron spin",
    "should be realized as perfectly as possible .",
    "since the photon energy is independent of the polarization direction , the electron energy should also be independent of the spin direction .",
    "this can be realized by the @xmath2-factor engineering@xcite .",
    "the light - hole exciton is preferable than the heavy - hole exciton because of the characteristic optical selection rule and the possible zeeman splitting in the in - plane magnetic field . in order to have the light - hole states as the ground hole states ,",
    "the strained quantum well ( qw ) structure is necessary and can be realized in ingaas / inp qw structures . in these strained qw structures",

    "it is beyond the scope of this article to discuss fully the exciton effect in the quantum state transfer .",
    "now we study influences of relaxation processes of the electron and the hole on the quantum state transfer . in the case of a gate - controlled quantum dot ,",
    "the electron is three - dimensionally confined , whereas the hole is not confined and is absorbed into the negatively biased gate , leaving behind only the photoexcited electron .",
    "thus the important issue is the quantum nature of the electron state after extraction of the hole : how much is the electron spin coherence retained after the process ? to answer this question , we will analyze the time evolution of the whole system based on the density matrix formalism . just after the photoexcitation given by eq .",
    "( [ eqq1 ] ) , the density matrix of the electron - hole system is supposed to be given by @xmath24 then the hole is extracted into the negatively biased gate electrode . in order to simulate this process , we introduce a model consisting of three hole states as depicted in fig . 2 ; one of them is the hole state @xmath25 created in a quantum dot by the photoexcitation , the second one is an intermediate hole state @xmath26 representing a delocalized state around the gate electrode and the third one is the swept - out state in the gate . the most important mechanism degrading the electron spin coherence is the electron - hole exchange interaction which induces the spin state mixing . during the hole extraction to the negatively biased electrode",

    "the short - range electron - hole exchange interaction is small since the spatial overlap between the @xmath38 state and other states is negligible and the long - range electron - hole exchange interaction due to the dipole - dipole interaction may also be small .",

    "in the favorable case , the magnitude of the electron - hole exchange interaction denoted by @xmath41 is taken to be 3 @xmath42ev and the hole transfer ( tunneling ) time ( @xmath431 ps ) is short enough to suppress the spin state mixing by the electron - hole exchange interaction .",

    "the purity decreases rapidly within several tens of picoseconds after photoexcitation due to the electron - hole exchange interaction .",
    "the characteristic time scale is given by @xmath48 and is 33 ps .",
    "then the purity is decreasing slowly due to the electron spin decoherence itself ( @xmath49s ) .",

    ", we can conclude that for the secure quantum state transfer we have to extract the photoexcited hole quickly before the spin state mixing sets in due to the electron - hole exchange interaction .",
    "the model used here has an empirical character and a more quantitative analysis would be necessary for the definite design of experiments of quantum state transfer@xcite .",
    "in the scheme of quantum repeater , the primary elements are the quantum state transfer between a photon and an electron and the entanglement swapping through the bell ( correlation ) measurement between two electrons which are created through the quantum state transfer from two photons .",
    "it is preferable to do the bell measurement between electrons instead of photons because the mismatch between the photon arrival times can be compensated by the rather long coherence time of electrons , whereas the storage of photons is rather difficult although the techniques for the photon storage are progressing steadily .",
    "thus we start the discussion assuming that two electrons are prepared in a semiconductor nanostructure , e.g. , a quantum dot .",
    "we propose an optical method to measure the spin state of two electrons based on the faraday or kerr rotation . here",
