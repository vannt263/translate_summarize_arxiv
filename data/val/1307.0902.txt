    "@xcite    the cue@xcite is designed in a pre / post format .",
    "the optional 20-minute pre - test contains 7 out of the 17 post cue questions which junior - level students might reasonably be expected to be able to solve based on their introductory course experience .",
    "the post - test is designed to be given at the end of the first upper - division semester in a single 50-minute lecture .",
    "the cue contains open - ended questions where students do not actually solve the given problems . instead , the instructions for the first half of the post - test are as follows :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ for each of the following , give a brief outline of the easiest method that you would use to solve the problem .",

    "reproduced from the cue assessment grading rubric.@xcite [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     the first thing to note is that of the relevant responses , only 3% of cu students used a potential approach ( 9% of correct answers ) , in contrast to 11% of osu students ( 33% of correct answers ) .",
    "even more striking is the difference in the explicit use of the word `` superposition . ''",
    "of all relevant answers ( combining a , b , c , d ) , @xmath0 of cu students explicitly used the term `` superposition , '' compared to the same percentage of osu students who did * not * use this term .",
    "this pattern is also evident in the correct responses ( a and b only ) . of all correct answers",
    "( combining a and b ) , @xmath1 of osu students * did not * explicitly use the term `` superposition , '' compared to 82% of cu students who * did * use this term .    in order to look more closely at the issue of",
    "_ what _ is being superposed , we also did a comparison without considering the use of the word `` superposition '' or distinguishing between electric field and potential approaches .",
    "these results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : q5data - all ] , which groups all correct categories ( a and b ) and all incorrect or ambiguous categories ( c and d ) .",
    "the overall results are comparable for both universities .",
    "it was surprising to us that in both schools only @xmath2 of all students took a clearly correct ( electric or potential field ) approach to this problem ( @xmath3 of relevant responses ) .",
    "if we look only at relevant answers , in almost @xmath4 of cases students were either unclear about what they wanted to add / superimpose or were clearly talking about adding charges .",
    "in most e&m i courses , students begin with the electric field approach , and only after they master this concept do they move on to the potential approach . as a consequence ,",
    "the electric field approach is an intuitive and natural way for those students to tackle problems .",
    "this might explain why so few cu students tried to solve this problem using potentials , compared to osu students , who are introduced to potential before electric field .",
    "this is a question we are currently exploring.@xcite    regarding the difference in explicit use of the word `` superposition '' , the cu course materials,@xcite which include lecture notes , clicker questions , tutorials , _ etc .",
    "_ , seem to strongly emphasize the term `` superposition . ''",
    "for example , in both the instructor and student manuals for the first tutorial , one can find the following note :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a common hw and exam problem asks for the e - field caused by a charged disc .",
    "hint : a disc is the sum of many rings . did someone say `` superposition '' ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this emphasis is not similarly apparent in the paradigms materials.@xcite    additionally , as one might expect at the institution that developed the cue , one can see the impact of this test in the reformed course materials , such as clicker questions that are similar to questions on the cue , in whole or in part .",
    "this interaction between the development of the course materials and the development of the assessment is not unexpected , but it is important to consider when extending the assessment beyond the original institution .",
    "two of the stated goals of the cue are to `` serve as a comparative instrument to assess upper - division e&m courses '' and to help `` education researchers to learn more about specific areas where upper - level students are struggling.''@xcite using the question on the superposition principle as an example , we identify two ways in which the cue is not fulfilling these goals as well as it could using the current rubric .",
    "the emphasis in the rubric on the terminology of `` superposition '' and lack of inclusion of a potential approach represent a potential bias toward the traditional subject order and emphasis that obscures interesting differences between approaches .",
    "even more striking is the lack of information the current rubric provides about an important area where students seem to be struggling , independent of approach .",
    "both osu and cu have made major reforms designed to help students understand superposition , though in different ways . yet , despite these reforms , more than 40% at each school do not recognize the need for superposition on this problem and of those that do , almost 70% do not clearly identify what they are superposing .",
    "the categorization we propose here allows one to identify how a teaching scheme may impact responses and even more importantly , illuminates an important issue about student understanding of superposition that is obscured in the original rubric .",
    "we suggest that a similar reexamination of the rest of the cue might provide additional examples where insight on student understanding would broaden the impact of the cue as a tool for assessing upper - division e&m courses .",
    "the university of colorado is currently working on a multiple - choice version of the cue .",
    "this provides an excellent opportunity for just such a re - analysis .",
    "a recent interview with two osu undergraduates suggests that the issues raised in this paper are still of concern with the multiple - choice version of the cue .",
    "supported in part by nsf due 1023120 .",
    "we would like to thank steve pollock , rachel pepper and bethany wilcox for conversations about the design and grading of the cue and for sharing some of the cu test data ."
