    "the ligo interferometers @xcite are part of a world - wide network of gravitational wave detectors constructed to detect waves from astrophysical sources such as spinning neutron stars , coalescing binary black holes and neutron stars , and supernovae .",
    "each of the two arms of the ligo interferometers forms a resonant fabry - perot cavity .",
    "this increases the effective arm - length and thus the sensitivity of the instruments .",
    "gravitational waves ( along with seismic and other noise ) change the relative length of the optical cavities and produce an external strain , h(t)= [ ht0 ] that is incident on the interferometer . here ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 are the effective lengths of the @xmath2 and @xmath3-arms , respectively and @xmath4 the effective length of the cavities in the absence of an external strain .    the output of the interferometers , however , is not @xmath5 .",
    "rather , the output is derived from light that escapes the anti - symmetric ( `` dark '' ) port and provides the gravitational wave read - out .",
    "it is often called the error signal or `` gravitational wave channel '' . here",
    "we will refer to it as @xmath6 .",
    "the re - construction of the gravitational wave strain @xmath5 from the error signal @xmath6 is an essential part of the data analysis .",
    "since the ligo instruments are linear the gravitational wave strain incident on the interferometer is a a linear functional of @xmath6 , namely , h(t)=r(t - t)q(t)dt , where @xmath7 is a suitable convolution kernel .",
    "convolution in the time domain is simple multiplication in the frequency domain so that h(f)=r(f)q(f ) , [ eq2 ] where @xmath8 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath9 .",
    "the ratio of the gravitational wave strain to the error signal is called the response function @xmath10 .",
    "finding the response function , or alternatively the kernel @xmath7 , is the procedure referred to as the calibration .",
    "so far ligo has used a calibration implemented entirely in the frequency domain @xcite , i.e. using eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the british - german interferometric detector geo600 @xcite has always produced a real - time calibrated @xmath5 using time - domain filters @xcite .",
    "some progress toward the production of @xmath5 for the ligo interferometers has already taken place @xcite . in this work",
    "we adapt the geo time - domain calibration method to the case of the ligo interferometers .",
    "in section  [ simple ] we provide a simple description of the length sensing and control system of the ligo interferometers , review the frequency domain calibration procedure and formally show how the strain can be reconstructed from the error signal of the interferometer in the time domain . in section  [ match ] we describe a method to track changes in the response using sinusoidal excitations injected into the instrument . in section  [ pipe ] we explain how the digital filters used to reproduce and invert the responses of various parts of the length control system are created and show their performance in the case of the hanford 4 km interferometer during the second science run ( s2 ) . we also describe our signal processing pipeline .",
    "we conclude in section  [ concl ] .    , which converts the residual strain @xmath11 into the error signal @xmath12 , the feedback filter @xmath13 , which converts the error signal into the digital control signal @xmath14 , and the actuation @xmath15 which converts the digital control signal into the control strain @xmath16 that is subtracted from the external strain @xmath17 .",
    "the digital signals @xmath6 and @xmath18 are recorded by the data acquisition system at @xmath19 . ,",
    "at low frequencies the external strain @xmath17 is dominated by seismic noise and a control strain , @xmath16 , is subtracted from it ( see figure  [ simpleservo ] ) by physically moving the mirrors in the fabry - perot cavity to compensate for the seismic noise .",
    "this ensures that the residual strain that enters the optical cavity , @xmath11 , remains small at low frequencies and keeps the optical cavities in resonance .",
    "the optical cavity of the feedback loop is represented by the so - called sensing function , @xmath20 .",
    "it converts the residual strain @xmath11 into the digital error signal @xmath12 , also called the gravitational wave channel , which is sampled at @xmath19 and recorded by the data acquisition system .",
    "the error signal is measured in arbitrary units called counts . here",
    ", @xmath21 is a reference sensing function that is measured at some time and @xmath22 is an overall ( real ) gain that depends on the light power stored in the fabry - perot cavity which changes with the alignment of the mirrors .",
    "it is important to keep track of this gain and the method we use is explained in section  [ match ] .",
    "the frequency dependence of the sensing function is determined primarily by the fabry - perot cavity in each arm and corresponds to a real pole at around @xmath23 .    a digital feedback filter , @xmath24 ,",
    "is applied to the error signal @xmath12 which produces a digital control signal @xmath14 .",
    "the digital control signal , like the residual signal , is measured in units of counts .",
    "it is recorded by the data acquisition system at @xmath25 . here , @xmath26 is the feedback filter at some reference time and @xmath27 is a real overall gain .",
    "the gain @xmath27 is also recorded by the data acquisition system and may vary in time .",
    "for the first and second science runs ( s1 and s2 ) , however , it was kept fixed . the filter @xmath26 consists of a double pole at dc and various low pass filters as well as additional filters that keep the optics aligned and the fabry - perot cavity in resonance .",
    "the control signal @xmath14 is converted to strain and used to adjust the length of the cavities via the actuation function @xmath15 .",
    "this is achieved by converting the digital signal @xmath14 into currents that run through coils placed near magnets glued on the back of the mirrors in the fabry - perot cavity .",
    "the frequency response of the actuation function is largely determined by the pendulum suspension of the mirrors and thus consists of a pair of complex poles at the pendulum frequency @xmath28 .",
    "the re - construction of the external strain from the output of the interferometer feedback loop is referred to as the calibration .",
    "calibration of ligo data has thus far been performed in the frequency domain by constructing a response function @xmath10 that acts on the error signal @xmath29 of the feedback loop , namely , h(f)=r(f)q(f ) .",
    "[ hf ] the response function can be derived from the feedback loop equations @xmath30 from these equations it is easy to show that @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ hf ] ) is given by r(f)= , [ respf ] where @xmath31 is the reference open loop gain .",
    "the optical gain @xmath22 typically varies on a time - scale of seconds .",
    "the digital gain @xmath27 may also vary but was kept fixed during s1 and s2 . hence eqs .",
    "( [ fback1]-[fback4 ] ) apply for frequencies above a few tens of hz .",
    "we would like to perform this procedure entirely in the time domain . to do this we reconstruct the strain time - series @xmath5 from the residual and control strains @xmath32 and @xmath33 as follows .",
    "the residual strain @xmath11 is given by x_r(t)=h(t)-x_c(t ) , [ xr1 ] so that [ ht1 ] h(t)=x_c(t)+x_r(t ) . the low frequency part of the external strain is dominated by the control strain @xmath33 and the high frequency part is dominated by the residual strain @xmath32 .",
    "the optical gain of the sensing function @xmath22 typically varies on much longer time - scales than the decay time of the impulse response of the inverse of the sensing function .",
    "thus , the residual strain can be formally re - constructed according to x_r(t)t_c_0 ^ -1[q(t ) ] , [ xr2 ] where @xmath34 is a linear time - invariant filter operator for the inverse of the sensing function @xmath21 .",
    "similarly the control strain @xmath33 can be constructed from @xmath18 by filtering it through the actuation function x_c(t)=t_a[d(t ) ] .",
    "[ xc1 ] therefore we can write the time series for the external strain in terms of the error and digital control signals , @xmath6 and @xmath18 respectively , as [ ht2 ] h(t)t_c_0 ^ -1[q(t)]+t_a[d(t ) ] .",
    "although @xmath18 is an output of the interferometer servo loop recorded by the data acquisition system it can be computed from the error signal @xmath6 again assuming that @xmath27 varies in time much more slowly than the decay time of the impulse response function of the feedback filter as it is currently defined this condition is never satisfied : the double pole at dc results in an ill - behaved digital filter that does not have a well - defined impulse response time .",
    "later we show how to construct a modified digital filter @xmath35 which does satisfy this condition . ] . in particular ,",
    "d(t)(t ) t_d_0[q(t ) ] .",
    "[ xc2 ] so in terms of just the error signal @xmath6 the external strain can also be written as [ ht3 ] h(t)t_c_0 ^ -1 + t_a .",
    "note that , because @xmath27 is constant we could have factored it out of the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ht3 ] ) .",
    "thus , in order to produce the time - series for the external strain we need 1 ) to track changes in the optical gain of the cavity , and 2 ) construct time - domain digital filters for the inverse of the sensing function , the actuation function and the feedback filter .",
    "these problems are dealt with in the next two sections .",
    "in order to track changes in the optical gain of the cavity , calibration lines are injected into the instrument by adding sinusoidal excitations to the control signal .",
    "this is a standard technique used in gravitational wave detectors . in the ligo",
    "interferometers three calibration lines are injected ; one at around @xmath36 , another one around @xmath37 near the unity gain frequency of the open loop transfer function , and a third one at a few tens of hz .",
    "the excitations may be added directly to the digital control signal @xmath14 .",
    "alternatively they may injected into one of the two arms , as shown in figure  [ actuation ] . during",
    "s2 they were injected into the @xmath2-arm of the interferometers and for the purposes of the following calculation we will assume this to be the case .",
    "generalisations to injections into the @xmath3-arm or to the case where they are directly added to the digital control signal @xmath14 are trivial .",
    "figure  [ actuation ] depicts a more detailed model of the actuation function @xmath15 that shows the injection point .",
    "the actuation function @xmath15 is given by [ actua ] a= k_y g_y a_y- k_x g_x a_x , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are analog gains measured at dc that depend on the configuration of each of the arms and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are digital gains that are mainly used to compensate for differences in the analog gains .",
    "the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the same for both arms except for digital notch filters that take out frequency components of the signal at the violin mode frequencies of the mirror suspensions .",
    "since the calibration lines are not injected at those frequencies , for our purposes the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 are identical along both arms and we can write a_x = a_y a_*. [ actxyeq ]     in figure  [ simpleservo ] . , width=9 ]    the excitation @xmath44 is added to the @xmath2-arm signal after the digital gain @xmath40 is applied to the digital control signal . therefore rather than eq .",
    "( [ fback3 ] ) , the feedback equation for the control signal at the frequency of a calibration line @xmath45 reads [ xc_line1 ] x_c(f_c)=a(f_c)d(f_c)-g_xa_*(f_c)l(f_c ) . using eqs .",
    "( [ actua ] ) and ( [ actxyeq ] ) we can write this as [ xc_line2 ] x_c(f_c)=a(f_c)[d(f_c)-l(f_c ) ] . with @xmath46 . since the calibration line is injected with an amplitude that is large compared to the external strain , the residual strain is dominated by the control signal at the frequency of the calibration line .",
    "so to a good approximation we can write the feedback equation for the control signal , eq .  ( [ fback1 ] ) , as [ xr_line1 ] x_r(f_c)-x_c(f_c ) . combining eqs .",
    "( [ xc_line2 ] ) and ( [ xr_line1 ] ) with the feedback loop equations , ( [ fback2 ] ) and ( [ fback4 ] ) which remain un - changed , we arrive at two independent expressions ; one for the product of @xmath22 and @xmath27 [ alphabeta ] ( t)(t ) where @xmath47 , and another for @xmath22 , [ alpha ] ( t ) where @xmath48 .    thus , the sensing function gain @xmath22 as well as its product with the feedback filter @xmath27 are given by expressions involving the complex functions @xmath15 , @xmath21 and @xmath49 as well as complex ratios of the error and digital control signals to the injected excitation .    the digital feedback filter gain @xmath27 is recorded by the data acquisition system and so eqs .  ( [ alphabeta ] ) and ( [ alpha ] )",
    "should be regarded as two independent ways of calculating the optical gain @xmath22 .",
    "the ratios of the error and digital control signals to the injected excitation are computed as follows .",
    "we take a fixed amount of time for each of the three time - series @xmath6 , @xmath18 and @xmath50 , and apply a hann window .",
    "we then perform a complex heterodyne at the frequency of the calibration line @xmath45 and finally integrate over time .",

    "( [ xr_line1 ] ) is a good approximation .",
    "it should be noted however that eq .",
    "( [ xr_line1 ] ) can be made arbitrarily accurate by either making the amplitude of the injected line arbitrarily large or , since the external strain has no component that is correlated with the calibration lines , by integrating for an arbitrarily long amount of time .",
    "the optical gain @xmath22 is typically calculated on time - scales of a few tens of seconds which , given the typical injected amplitudes of the calibration lines , is sufficient to reduce measurement noise errors to an acceptable few percent .",
    "the three filters of the feedback loop can be described in terms of analog zero and pole models .",

    "unfortunately , digitisation of a zero does not lead to a well behaved digital filter . in order to resolve this problem",
    "we introduce a pole at high frequencies in the inverted sensing function @xmath57 prior to digitisation . to ensure the magnitude and phase response of the filter do not change in the frequency range of interest to @xmath58 .",
    "this range covers the frequency bands used in gravitational wave data analyses performed by the ligo scientific collaboration so far . ] the additional pole is placed at a sufficiently large value of the frequency .",
    "we then digitise the analog filter using a bi - linear transform at a sample rate consistent with the presence of the additional pole .",

    "this filter introduces frequency dependent phase shifts in the data that need to be accounted for .",
    "the anti - aliasing filter contains a series of zeros on the imaginary axis , which in the inverted filter turn into poles . to ensure that we obtain a well - behaved inverse digital filter the zeros need to be moved away from the imaginary axis prior to digitisation .    for the hanford 4 km interferometer in the s2 run we generated a modified digital filter @xmath61 with a bi - linear transform at a sample rate @xmath62 times greater than the sample rate the of the time series @xmath6 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath63 . the zeros of the elliptic filter were moved away from the imaginary axis by approximately @xmath64 and a single real pole was added at @xmath65 .",

    "the errors between @xmath67 and @xmath68 are less than about @xmath69 in magnitude and @xmath70 in phase .    the ligo digital feedback filters @xmath26 are constructed from bi - linear transformations at @xmath19 of a series of analog filters .",

    "additionally , the actuation function contains an anti - imaging @xmath75 order elliptic filter at @xmath60 , a snubber used to suppress resonances in the electronics and a measured @xmath76 time - delay modeled using a @xmath75 order pade filter .",
    "the actuator also contains a series of digital notch filters that remove components of the digital control signal at the violin mode frequencies of the mirror suspensions .",

    "the errors in the magnitude and phase are less than about @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively at frequencies up to a few hundred hz . at higher frequencies the errors in the phase become larger but this is un - important : the contribution to the external strain @xmath5 from the control signal @xmath33 is negligible above a few hundred hz .",
    "ligo data is available in so - called `` science segments '' . at these times",
    "the cavities are in resonance and the instrument is sufficiently stable to produce data of scientific quality .",
    "the length of science segments depends mostly on the level of seismic activity at the location of each of the sites and can last anywhere between a few tens of seconds to tens of thousands of seconds .    science runs typically consist of a few hundred science segments .",
    "this lends the calculation of the external strain for an entire science run amenable to a cost - effective beowulf cluster , which is an ensemble of loosely coupled processors with a simple network architecture . in our implementation",
    "each processor computes the external strain for a science segment .",
    "the few hundred processes required can be scheduled to run on the cluster with a batch system such as condor @xcite .",
    "indeed , the pipeline described below was used to compute the external strain for the entire s2 run for all three ligo interferometers using condor on the 300-node medusa cluster @xcite at uwm .     and",

    "s2 we chose to compute the optical gain every 60s .",
    "science segments can be up to a few tens of thousands of seconds long .",
    "therefore we can not keep all the data for a science segment in the memory of a single node . as a result , in our signal processing pipeline",
    ", each science segment must be divided into a number of shorter parts . in the current implementation of the pipeline",

    "( [ ht3 ] ) .",
    "the top and bottom branches show the computations of the residual and control strains respectively .    to avoid problems involving the dynamic range of double precision floating point numbers , we first high - pass filter 16s of the error signal @xmath6 .",
    "for the hanford 4 km interferometer during s2 we implemented the high - pass filter using a @xmath78 order butterworth filter at @xmath79 . this is a conservative choice and the specific frequency and order of the filter that is necessary depends on the low frequency character of the data .",
    "generally , we expect these choices to depend on the specific science run and interferometer . for numerical stability",
    "the high - pass filter is divided into second order sections .",
    "furthermore , to ensure the phase of the signal is not adversely affected by the filtering procedure , the high - pass butterworth filter is applied to each segment of the data once forward and once in reverse .",
    "it should be noted that this procedure is acausal but since we are not attempting to simulate a physical process this is unimportant .",
    "since the data is being calibrated in segments care must be taken at the boundaries between consecutive segments .",
    "the finite impulse response time of the butterworth filter produces a discontinuity at the beginning and also at the end of each segment ( because the high - pass filter is applied forward as well as in reverse ) . to ensure continuity across contiguous segments",

    "s2 we have chosen a @xmath82 order butterworth filter at @xmath83 which is applied to each data segment once forward and once in reverse in second order sections . to ensure continuity across contiguous segments we apply a procedure along the lines described above and in figure [ segments ] adding an extra second of data at the end of each 16s segment",
