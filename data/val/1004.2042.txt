    "the afterglows of several short gamma ray bursts ( sgrbs ) have recently been localized on the sky with swift ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) , allowing for a determination of their redshift and host galaxy ( see e.g. berger 2009 ; fong , berger & fox 2010 ) .",
    "sgrbs are been observed in all kinds of galaxies ( from star - bursts to ellipticals and also associated with galaxy clusters ) with a wide range of offsets .",
    "sgrbs are currently believed to result from the coalescence of a compact binary , either a double neutron star or a neutron star ( ns ) and a black hole ( bh ) binary ( nakar 2007 ) .",
    "compact binaries are known to form in different environments along two main channels : ( i ) from the evolution of massive stars in primordial binaries rising in the galactic field ( narayan , paczynski & piran 1992 ) , and ( ii ) through three ( or a few)-body dynamical interactions among stars and compact remnants in globular clusters ( gcs ) ( grindlay , portegies zwart & mcmillan 2006 ) .",
    "salvaterra et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have shown that both formation channels are needed in order to reproduce the _ swift _ redshift distribution of sgrbs , with the dynamical channel in gcs contributing mainly at @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the nature of the observed offsets in relation to the galaxy type and burst environment in order to discriminate between the two channels and highlight the origin of sgrbs .",
    "a wide range of offsets is expected in both channels . in the primordial scenario ,",
    "a large separation from the host galaxy can originate from the natal kick rising at the time of formation of the compact object ( belczynski et al .",
    "this mechanism is not present in case of dynamical origin : few body interactions that are at the origin of dynamical double neutron stars do not release binaries with large recoil velocities ( devecchi et al . in preparation ) .",
    "so , the offset in this latter case has to be ascribed to the underlying gc spatial distribution . for isolated galaxies",
    "this reflects the gc distribution that is known to decline more gently compared to stars ( see brodie & strader 2006 and references therein ) . in galaxy clusters , gcs may have a wider spread , since there are hints ( both theoretical and observational ) that a population of intra - cluster gcs ( icgcs ) can exist .",
    "sgrbs inside icgcs can explain large potential offsets in galaxy groups and clusters , besides natal kicks .",
    "we outline here three different cases for the origin of the offsets : ( i ) primordial sgrb kicked from a galaxy , isolated ( belczynski et al .",
    "2006 ) or in a cluster ( niino & totani 2008 ) , by a natal kick ; ( ii ) dynamical sgrb in a gc bound to an isolated or cluster galaxy , and ( iii ) dynamical sgrb in a icgc .",
    "the theoretical spatial distribution of primordial sgrbs has been computed for isolated galaxies of different types and sizes and @xmath1 , respectively . ] using population synthesis models by belczynski et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . the offset results from the combination of the natal kick velocity with the time that elapses from the formation of the compact binary and its gravitational wave driven coalescence time .",
    "we select two windows for the offset : the first between 010 kpc and the second between 10100 kpc .",
    "we note that with our definition of the offset we include also sgrbs located well inside the host galaxy . from figure  3 of belczynski et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we infer that the bulk of sgrb events happens within the 10 kpc scale for star - bursts and spirals , whereas for ellipticals this is true only for large hosts . for small ellipticals",
    "only @xmath2% shows this kind of offsets .",
    "the relative fraction of sgrbs with small offset increases from early to late host galaxies , and from small to large hosts .",
    "instead , we find that the 10100 kpc window is always poorly populated by primordial sgrbs regardless the type and size of the host galaxy , being the fraction of merging double neutron stars ( dns ) around @xmath3% . finally , only for small ellipticals , we have a good probability ( @xmath4% ) to find sgrbs with very large offset ( i.e. @xmath5 kpc ) , whereas in other host types this fraction is only @xmath6% .",
    "this finding may not hold true if the host is member of a galaxy cluster . as shown by niino & totani ( 2008 ) , the fraction of sgrb events occurring at very large offset may be as large as @xmath7% if the potential well of each member galaxy is determined by stars instead of dark matter due to dilution in the clustering process . if , instead , the dark matter sub - halos are associated to member galaxies as for field galaxies , the escape fraction is only 20% .",

    "the optical afterglow is in this case quite faint ( magnitude r@xmath64 for a burst exploding at @xmath58 and observed at @xmath65 s ) requiring 8-m telescope follow - up observations .",
    "we note that sgrbs in icgcs should be brighter as they blow inside the denser medium of the gc , so that a possible discriminant could be the detection of a relative bright optical afterglow .",
    "in this paper , we showed how the combination of the observed spatial offset , host type / mass and afterglow brightness can shed light on the pathway of formation of sgrb binary progenitors , resulting either from primordial stellar binaries , or from dynamical interactions in gcs .",
    "the main results of our study are summarized in fig .",
    "key results of our analysis are :    * if a sgrb is observed with a large separation from a massive , isolated galaxy we expect that it belongs to the dynamical channel and , residing in a globular cluster , it may show an observable x - ray and optical afterglow ; * a sgrb exploding with a large offset from a small , isolated host galaxy is likely to ensue from the primordial channel . in this case the progenitor binary is ejected in the intergalactic medium following a large natal kick . nor or weak afterglow is expected given the very low density of the medium ; * a sgrb observed within 10 kpc from the center of a massive galaxy ( either isolated or in a cluster ) should arise from the primordial channel with a detectable afterglow ; * a sgrb associated to a galaxy cluster but not to any of its specific members may result from both formation scenarios .",
    "a possible discriminant could be the detection of an optical afterglow that is expected to be brighter in the case of the denser intra - cluster globular cluster natal environment ; * a sgrb with an offset of 10 - 100 kpc from a small , isolated galaxy is more probably originated from the dynamical channel and this may be confirmed from the identification of the afterglow .",
    "we now apply our results to a few observed sgrbs .",
    "troja et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggested that sgrbs showing an extended - duration soft emission component in their prompt emission preferentially have small projected physical offsets .",
    "recent _ hst _ observations of a sample of sgrb host galaxies show that the distribution of offsets has a median of @xmath30 kpc , about 5 times larger than for long grbs , with no evidence of differences between sgrbs with and without extended emission ( fong et al .",
    "2010 ) . in the case of a host galaxy at low redshift ,",
    "deep optical / nir imaging can allow to resolve the galaxy surface brightness profile ; the detection of an optical afterglow can then clearly pinpoint the sgrb position with respect to the host galaxy .",
    "this is the case of grb071227 ( @xmath66 ) and grb060505 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "grb071227 was firmly classified as a sgrb ( sato et al .",
    "2007 , golenetskii et al . 2007",
    "; onda et al .",
    "2008 ) and occurred on the plane of a large ( @xmath68 kpc ) spiral galaxy at a relatively large offset ( @xmath2 kpc ; davanzo et al 2009 ; fong et al 2010 ) .",
    "this could equally favor both the primordial or dynamical formation channel for its progenitor ( fig .",
    "we note however that its location on the galactic plane and within the light of the host likely favors a primordial origin .",
    "the case of grb060505 is even more interesting , given that the classification of this grb is still debated .",
    "the duration ( @xmath69 s ) and the spectral lag point towards a long grb classification ( mcbreen et al .",
    "2008 ; xu et al 2009 ) , the non - detection of an associated supernova down to deep limits favors for a sgrb ( ofek et al .",
    "2007 ) , while detailed study of its host galaxy led to different interpretations of its progenitor ( levesque & kewley 2007 ; thoene et al . 2008 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we note that grb060505 is an outlier of the @xmath70 correlation like all sgrbs of known redshift and peak energy @xmath71 ( amati et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the scenario of a double compact object merger progenitor for grb060505 , the position of the afterglow at an offset of 6.5 kpc from a large spiral galaxy ( levesque & kewley 2007 ; thoene et al . 2008 ) , makes a primordial origin highly probable ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "a primordial origin is also a valuable hypothesis for the progenitor of the farthest short - duration ( @xmath72 s ) grb , occurred at @xmath73 ( grb090426 ; levesque et al . 2010 ; antonelli et al .",
    "the position of the optical afterglow inside the host galaxy , the intrinsic absorption measured in the x - ray spectrum , and the redshift could be indicative of a `` primordial '' binary system that merged in a relatively short time ( @xmath74 yr ) . on the other hand , a core - collapse origin for this burst can not be excluded in light of its consistency with the @xmath70 correlation that holds for long grbs ( antonelli et al . 2009 ) , making the classification of grb090426 not straightforward .    as discussed above ,",
    "the measure of the redshift of a sgrb is a key issue to accurately evaluate its offset and to relate it with the size of its host galaxy .",
    "however , some conclusions can also be drawn for those sgrbs with no measured redshift .",
    "the detection of an optical afterglow with sub - arsec precision coincident with the profile of a galaxy ( see , e.g. grb070707 and grb051227 ; piranomonte et al .",
    "2008 , davanzo et al .",
    "2009 ) strongly hints for an association between the two objects . for these bursts , offsets are consistent with zero , and the sgrb positions follow the host light . from a statistical point of view",
    "the majority of these systems probably originate from the primordial channel as a population of sgrbs exploding inside gcs should result in larger offsets .",
    "a few interesting counter examples do exist .",
    "grb  061201 and grb  070809 are two sgrbs for which the detection of an optical afterglow has allowed to determine their position with high accuracy .",
    "deep , follow - up observations fail to find a host galaxy coincident with the optical afterglow .",
    "the field of grb  061201 has been studied by stratta et al .",
    "( 2007 ) with vlt and fong et al .",
    "( 2010 ) with hst .",
    "no host is revealed down to r(ab)@xmath75 ( stratta et al . 2007 ) .",
    "two galaxies are in the field of grb  061201 : a spiral galaxy at @xmath76 ( stratta et al .",
    "2007 ) at a projected distance of @xmath77 kpc and a fainter object with undetermined redshift at 1.8@xmath78 ( fong et al . 2010 ) .",
    "although the ejection hypothesis from one of these host candidates can not be excluded , we note that the burst should have likely exploded in a gas poor environment far away from the host .",
    "this is in contrast with the relative bright afterglow observed .",
    "grb  061201 is also know to be 0.9 mpc away from the galaxy cluster aco s 995 at @xmath79 .",
    "while the ejection hypothesis from the cluster center appears unlikely due to the high kick velocity required , we note that a sizable fraction ( @xmath29% , see fig .",
    "2 ) of the icgc population is still present at @xmath80 mpc .",
    "we suggest that grb  061201 originates from the dynamical channel inside a icgc of aco s 995 .",
    "the denser environment inside the host gc may be responsible for the brightness of its optical afterglow .",
    "a second interesting case is grb  070809 that is likely a sgrb ( see barthelmy et al .",
    "similar to grb  061201 , this burst shows an optical afterglow but no underlying host galaxy to g(ab)=26.3 ( perley et al .",
    "a possible host candidate has been identified in a small spiral galaxy ( @xmath81 ) at @xmath82 ( perley et al .",
    "2008 ) away from the optical afterglow position ( perley et al .",
    "2008 ) . ] . at this redshift ,",
    "the projected distance is @xmath83 kpc . accordingly to fig .",
    "3 the probability of detecting a sgrb with this offset from a small galaxy is rather low ( @xmath84% ) for the primordial channel . a dynamical origin is preferred in this case . as for grb  061201",
    ", the optical detection of the afterglow supports this interpretation .",
    "we also notice that the dynamical channel is expected to contribute most to the sgrb population at the redshift of the putative host of grb  070809 ( salvaterra et al .",
