    "the term `` electron temperature '' in an hii  region usually refers to the apparent [ o  iii ] electron temperature , t@xmath1 , derived from the [ o  iii ] optical spectra of the nebula , using a simple method based on the relative collisional excitation rates of the @xmath2d@xmath3 and @xmath2s@xmath4 levels of o@xmath5 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this ( with similar measurements for o@xmath6 ) is used as the basis for calculating the total oxygen abundance , when the electron temperatures are available .",
    "spectra arising from collisional excitation in a particular region in the nebula will exhibit the characteristics of the local electron temperature ( or electron energy distribution ) and radiative environment of that region , but observed electron temperatures are only mean electron temperatures , as they are calculated from emission lines averaged over a range of zones in the nebula , and with a range of physical temperatures . the abundance of oxygen",
    "is then determined from the integrated fluxes of [ o  iii ] and [ o  ii ] , using the derived [ o  iii ] and [ o  ii ] electron temperatures .",
    "the apparent abundance is , therefore , only approximately related to the true oxygen abundance .",
    "the matter is complicated further if there are non - equilibrium electron energy distributions , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .    due to the highly non - uniform physical structures in real hii  regions , no general photoionization model is yet capable of precisely reproducing the observed spectral emissions .",
    "the simplest approximation to an hii  region , is the uniform `` single slab '' model .",
    "this is a poor approximation to the behavior of a real hii  region , as it assumes all the ionic species are uniformly distributed and at the same physical temperature , and needs to be corrected to reflect the true distribution of ions and temperatures .",
    "for example , the [ o  ii ] emission arises predominantly from the cooler ( usually outer ) regions of the nebula whereas the [ o  iii ] emission is more uniformly distributed . assuming that the two ions are emitting at the same temperature will overestimate the [ o  ii ] flux ( per atom ) and thus underestimate the [ o  ii ] abundance in a real nebula",
    ". empirical or theory - based correction factors are often applied @xcite .",
    "other ionization states , for example , o@xmath7 and o , occur in the highest and lowest excitation ( usually innermost and outmost ) regions of the nebula , respectively .",
    "unobserved species such as o@xmath7 which affect the populations of observed species are accounted for the so - called `` ionization correction factors '' , discussed by many authors .",
    "taking into account this three - dimensional structure , a more realistic model is the three dimensional `` strmgren sphere '' , with a stellar or star cluster excitation source at the centre , a stellar - wind - evacuated central region , and radial zones of ionized gas at different physical temperatures .",
    "these give rise to differing amounts of spectral emission from different ionic species , the observed results of which are the integrated spectral emissions from all the radial zones for each ionic species .",
    "the models can then be compared with the spectra observed in real hii  regions .",
    "current photoionization models such as mappings iv @xcite are based on this physical structure .",
    "a still better approximation to real nebulae is to assume a spatially inhomogeneous turbulent structure for the nebula ( sutherland et al .",
    ", in progress , and earlier work , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but modeling this is significantly more computationally demanding . indeed , one look at the complexities of the orion , m17 and 30-doradus nebulae shows such variation in form as to defy accurate modeling .",
    "while extra - galactic hii  regions appear unresolved in more distant galaxies , they are very likely structurally as complex as the nearby nebulae , and at best , even inhomogeneous and fractal models are only approximations to reality . nonetheless , spherical models are very useful in exploring the effects of different physical parameters on the observed spectra .    in this work we use the strmgren sphere model , using the mappings iv photoionization code ( see appendix for the details of changes in the current version of the code since that described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to obtain information on the oxygen abundance of an observed but spatially unresolved hii  region , we need to identify the key physical parameters affecting the apparent electron temperature , and use these in the models to compare with observations",
    ". from these",
    "we derive a relation between the intrinsic nebular oxygen abundance and the apparent ( i.e. , volume and luminosity averaged ) [ o  iii ] mean electron temperature .",
    "the models are then used to generate relationships between electron temperature , t@xmath1 , and oxygen abundance , @xmath8 , for the model hii  region , to which the observed apparent electron temperature of a real object may compared .",
    "the electron temperatures that our models generate within an hii  region vary between @xmath930,000k and @xmath9100k , with 10,000k being typical . the inner zones ( at higher temperatures )",
    "have smaller volumes , per unit thickness , than the outer zones .",
    "measurements of the [ o  iii ] and [ o  ii ] apparent electron temperatures from spectra reflect the average conditions in core and outer regions of the nebula , respectively .",
    "the [ o  iii ] temperature provides an average over the bulk of the internal regions of an hii  region , and is the most useful ( and most widely used ) single measurement of the conditions in the nebula . however , it is important to recognize that this single value does not characterize the entire hii  region .",
    "this work continues on from our previous paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter  paper 1  ) . the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we discuss the measurement of electron temperatures and the calculation of oxygen abundances , relating the outputs from the mappings photoionization model code to data from the sigrid sample @xcite and , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data from ( data release 3 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , low metallicity emission line galaxy data from , and data for wolf - rayet galaxies from .",
    "these observations span a range of nebular metallicities between 1/50 and 1 solar .",

    "we consider the electron temperature  chemical abundance relation . in section 4",
    "we examine the effect of optical depth at the lyman edge of hydrogen at 912 . in section 5",
    "we consider the effect of the fuv spectral energy distribution of the central star cluster . in section 6",
    "we investigate the effects of pressure in hii  regions . in section 7",
    "we explore the role of the ionization parameter . in section 8",
    "we look at the effects dust . in section 9",
    "we explore the consequences of @xmath0 non - equilibrium electron energy distributions . in section 10",
    "we summarize the effects of these parameters . in section 11",
    "we look at the use of diagnostic line ratio grids from @xcite , and in section 12 we extend this to examine the extra information yielded by using three - dimensional grids . in section 13 we discuss our findings , and in section 14 we present our conclusions .",
    "determining the electron temperature from [ o  iii ] spectra from an hii  region has been discussed many times in the literature .",
    "the simplest technique is to use a graph of the 4363  and 5007 + 4959   [ o  iii ] lines , as shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 5.1 ) .",
    "other techniques have been proposed , such as the iterative method in , which has its origin in work by @xcite . here",
    "we have used the formulae derived from our mappings photoionization models , presented in @xcite , using the o@xmath5 collision strength data from @xcite ( see equation [ eq2 ] , below ) .",
    "all methods are based on the change of the relative populations of the @xmath2d@xmath3 and @xmath2s@xmath4 energy levels of o@xmath5 with temperature .",
    "when using the same o@xmath5 collision strength data , the methods give very similar results .",
    "the choice of collision strength data is important , as different data can lead to electron temperatures differing by as much as 5% at an electron temperature of 15,000k ( see figure 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "the palay data tend to give lower [ o  iii ] electron temperatures than older data sets .",
    "the recent collision strength calculations by @xcite tend to give higher electron temperatures , similar to those from .",
    "we have not been able to use these recent data in the mappings photoionization models as calculations for the upper level data needed by mappings do not converge ( storey , p , pers . comm . ) . for a detailed discussion of the effects of different collision strength data , see @xcite .",
    "there is an important limitation in the methods used to measure the [ o  iii ] electron temperature , for very low metallicity hii  regions . for the observational data considered in this paper , we have used the equations presented in @xcite .",
    "these are derived from the mappings models in @xcite , and apply for metallicities between 1/20 and 1 solar .",
    "alternative methods used by have a longer history , and are based on the original work of @xcite , for which fit parameters were only calculated for electron temperatures between 5,000 and 20,000k .",
    "the range restrictions in these methods limit the temperature ranges that can be calculated reliably .",
    "although both methods can generate values for the electron temperature @xmath10 20,000k , such values are the result of extrapolation outside the range of application , and are therefore not reliably based in physics . at higher temperatures the physics coming into play",
    "involves processes that do not affect the results at lower temperatures .",
    "models that do not allow for the increasing importance of the higher temperature processes will necessarily be unreliable .",
    "any significant , unaccounted for , change in behavior outside the specified ranges will lead to erroneous calculated temperatures .",
    "consequently , extrapolation is problematic , and values of t@xmath1 @xmath11 20,000k can not be considered reliable , if calculated using the methods discussed here .",
    "oxygen abundance is used as a proxy for total metallicity as it is the dominant heavy element species observable in the optical spectrum , its spectral lines are present throughout hii  regions , and it is produced in stellar nuclear reactions that give rise to the other major heavy element components ( e.g. , c and n ) .",
    "it is present in hii  regions in five forms : o@xmath7 , o@xmath5 , o@xmath12 , o@xmath13 and in dust .",
    "o@xmath7 is present only in the highest ionization zones closest to the stellar excitation source in hii  regions , and does not contribute significantly to total oxygen .",
    "o@xmath5 is the dominant form of oxygen in many low metallicity hii  regions where it occupies much of the body of the hii  region .",
    "o@xmath12 is excited in the outer zones , or regions where the higher energy photons have been depleted , and o@xmath13 is present only at the low - ionization outer edges .",
    "however , some hii  regions have dominant o@xmath12 excitation . in the models presented here ,",
    "we consider only a simple spherically symmetric model with a central strongly ionizing star cluster .",
    "figure [ fraco ] illustrates these points , showing the ionic fractions for the gaseous oxygen species calculated using the mappings iv photoionization code , as a function of radius for a spherical hii  region , from the minimum radius , r@xmath14 , at which the strmgren sphere is gas - filled , to the maximum , r@xmath15 , defined as the radius at which the atomic hydrogen is 99% neutral .",
    "the parameters for this calculation are @xmath16=7.5 , 12+log(o / h)@xmath17=0.1solar , optically thick , equilibrium electron energies , isobaric with @xmath18 = 5 , and using the starburst99 excitation model as described in section 3 , below .",
    "it is clear that o@xmath5 is the dominant ionic fraction over most of the volume of the nebula , o@xmath6 contributes mainly in the outer regions , and o@xmath13 only at the outer edge or lowest excitation regions .",
    "the ionization paramater , and the metallicity and oxygen abundance were defined in , but it is useful to repeat these definitions here . the ionization parameter @xmath19 ( sometimes expressed as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the speed of light ) is the ratio of the number of ionizing source photons passing through a unit volume to the neutral hydrogen density . the photon flux matches the number of new ions it produces , and as @xmath19 has the dimensions of velocity , it can be understood as the maximum speed at which the boundary of the ionized region can move outwards @xcite .",
    "@xmath19 is at its maximum at the inner edge of the ionized region of an hii  region , and falls to zero at the outer edge of the ionized nebula , where ( if ) the ionizing flux is fully depleted .",
    "a value of @xmath16 = 8.5 ( corresponding to @xmath22 = -1.98 ) is at the high end of values likely to be found in an hii  region ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "a more typical value for hii  regions is @xmath16 = 7.5 , and we use these values as reference levels in this paper . in these models ,",
    "the density is set by the pressure and temperature , through the parameter @xmath18 , discussed in detail in section 6 , below . as a standard , we use @xmath18 = 5.0 .",
    "the local value of the electron density set in this way depends on both the @xmath18 value and the local electron temperature : the actual electron density is @xmath23 5 @xmath24 .",
    "the metallicity is usually expressed in terms of the total oxygen abundance , as oxygen is the most prominent heavy element measurable in the optical spectrum , and is the most numerous species in hii  regions after hydrogen and helium .",
    "it is defined in terms of numerical values as 12+log(o / h ) .",
    "an alternative method is to define metallicity in terms of solar abundances . here",
    "( and in the mappings models ) we use the solar data from .",
    "metallicity is also sometimes described using the parameter z , but this is also used as an abundance by mass , so we have not used it in this paper . a further point to note",
    "is that the oxygen abundance measured from optical spectra is the gas - phase abundance , and does not account for oxygen locked up in dust . in our models",
    ", we have assumed solar depletion levels in dust , resulting in a difference of 0.07 dex between total oxygen abundance and gas - phase abundance .",
    "see the detailed discussion in section 8 , below .",
    "it is conventional to measure the apparent electron temperatures for o  iii from the 4363 , 4958 and 5007   lines , and for and o  ii using the 3726/9 and 7320   region lines . in the observations reported in , however , we did not measure the nir [ o  ii ] lines , nor the upper state [ n  ii ] lines which provide an alternative measure , so we have calculated t@xmath1(o  ii ) iteratively instead .",
    "a similar approach was taken by for some of their data , and by @xcite .    as we showed in",

    "@xmath32 where @xmath33 is the apparent electron temperature derived from the o  iii line ratio , for which there is a simple expression from @xcite , @xmath34 where the flux ratio for [ o  iii ] is , @xmath35 and a= 13205 , b= 0.92506 , and c=0.98062 .",
    "these parameters have been revised slightly from the earlier version , based on the latest outputs from the mappings iv photoionization code ( version 4.12 ) , but the electron temperatures are close to the earlier values .",
    "a similar equation accommodates the effects of the electron density ( equation 35 , * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , from , the abundance of o@xmath6 can be expressed in terms of the observed fluxes from the [ o  ii ] @xmath363726 and @xmath363729 lines , @xmath37 where , in this case , @xmath33 is the apparent electron temperature derived from the [ o  ii ] ratio ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the ratio of the 7320 - 30    lines to the 3726/9   lines . when the nir lines are not available , it is possible to derive an expression for the [ o  ii ] electron temperature from the mappings photoionization models as a polynomial in terms of _ total _ oxygen gas - phase abundance , @xmath38 where @xmath39=12+log(o / h ) . for the oxygen numerical abundance measured from spectra , to distinguish it from z ,",
    "the oxygen abundance by mass ] this equation is used iteratively , as discussed in , starting by using the o@xmath5 abundance as the total oxygen abundance .",
    "this process converges rapidly in 5 iterations or less .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have used a simpler approach , expressing the low ionization zone temperature ( effectively the [ o  ii ] temperature ) in terms of the [ o  iii ] temperature , which does not require iteration .",
    "equation [ eq5a ] shows the expression used by @xcite : @xmath40\\ ] ] equation [ eq5a ] gives total oxygen abundance values close to those from iterating equation [ eq5 ] .",
    "values determined for oxygen abundances are not exact , because of the nature of the approximations used , the calculated values for oxygen abundances depend on the photoionization models used to build the models , and the use of a model derived from a single value of the ionization parameter , @xmath19 .",
    "we tested the two methods ( equations [ eq5 ] and [ eq5a ] ) against artificial data from mappings , and find that they generate total oxygen abundances within 1% of the input values .",
    "the iterative approach ( equation [ eq5 ] ) is marginally the more consistent of the two over a range of ionization parameter values . using the polynomial and exponential fits to the parameters in these equations from ( equations",
    "6 - 9 ) , we can calculate the total gas - phase oxygen abundance from the observed nuv [ o  ii ] and optical [ o  iii ] lines .",
    "there are at least four sources of uncertainty in determining [ o  ii ] electron temperatures , and in general these are significantly less accurately measured than the [ o  iii ] electron temperatures .",
    "first , directly estimating the electron temperature requires measurements of the 3726,9   and 7320,30   lines in the ultraviolet and infrared , which are not always available in any given set of observations  the sdss , for example , does not measure the uv lines unless they are red - shifted into the spectroscopic passband .",
    "second , both sets of lines are usually subject to signal - to - noise problems .",
    "third , both equations [ eq5 ] and [ eq5a ] depend on the model parameters used .",
    "the models themselves depend on the computed collision strengths .",
    "in the case of o  ii , there are several collision strength data sets @xcite which are not in full agreement , resulting in slightly different calculated electron temperatures .",
    "these propagate into the estimation of o  ii abundance values , and thus into the total oxygen abundance .",
    "finally , the electron temperature formula determined from single slab models varies with the ionization parameter , @xmath16 , which differs for each observed object .",
    "the observational problems for [ o  ii ] temperatures were also discussed by @xcite .    in this work",
    "we have used the following sources : in mappings iv we use the tayal 2007 collision strengths ; the generic [ o  ii ] electron temperature formula derived from single slab mappings iv models used in @xcite ; and the iterative method to calculate total oxygen abundance ( equation [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "uncertainties arising from the flux measurements remain the largest source of error .      table [ t1 ] shows the data from for 16 objects from the sigrid sample for which oxygen abundances are available from both the direct t@xmath1 method ( equations [ eq1 ] , [ eq4 ] above ) and the strong line methods using the diagnostic grids from @xcite .",
    "we have used the diagnostic grids for log(nii / sii ) versus log(oiii / sii ) and log(nii / sii ) versus log(oiii / h@xmath31 ) as they provide the most consistent results , as noted in .",
    "column 5 in table [ t1 ] shows the difference between the direct and strong line methods . in general the strong line methods",
    "give higher oxygen abundances , with a mean excess of 0.149 dex .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "the primary source of this difference is that the diagnostic grids we use here include the total oxygen content , that is , the gas - phase oxygen plus the oxygen incorporated in dust grains , whereas the direct method yields only the gas - phase oxygen .",
    "this contributes a difference of 0.07 dex , or half the observed amount .",
    "as we will show below , there are other sources contributing to the observed differences .",
    "figure [ teza ] is a plot of of the theoretical [ o  iii ] electron temperature versus oxygen abundance for mappings isobaric model curves for @xmath16=8.50 , @xmath41 , for optically thick nebulae , and an electron density of @xmath97.5 @xmath24 ( @xmath18=5 ) .",

    "this can be understood by considering the physical processes occurring in spherically symmetric `` strmgren sphere '' hii  regions . in the ( innermost ) region of highest excitation ,",
    "the temperature is highest , but the volume is relatively small compared to cooler regions further from the excitation source .",
    "the observed fluxes are the volume weighted averages .",
    "the larger volumes of cooler lower ionization ( outer ) regions dilute the effect of the hotter inner regions .",
    "the net result is that for any particular excitation source , there is a limit to the observed apparent electron temperature that can be reached in a spherical model , no matter how low the oxygen abundance , and this is lower than the temperature of the innermost ionized region . as a result",

    "thus , for isobaric models , the product of the total number density and the electron temperature is constant . while the electron densities _ per se _  are not constant in these models , the @xmath18 values , together with the electron temperatures , set the electron densities : e.g. , if the electron temperature is 10,000k and @xmath18=6 , the electron density is @xmath948.4 @xmath24 .",
    "fixed pressure models are more physically realistic than fixed density ( isochoric ) models , in part because they allow the density to increase near the ionization front . at typical temperatures and densities ,",
    "the sound crossing time for an hii  region is of the same order as the lifetime of the region , so , in general , pressures will equilibrate . in the mappings code , for constant - pressure models , the density is a dependent parameter , set by @xmath60 and @xmath33 .",
    "the density structure emerges from the models , and the densities vary with the model . for low metallicity ( 1/20 solar ) and @xmath18=5 , model hydrogen ( ionized and neutral ) number densities vary typically from 1.5 to 20 @xmath24 at inner and outer zones . for higher metallicities ( 1 solar ) ,",

    "supernova explosions contribute further to the internal pressure of the bubble .",

    "if this departure is caused , or contributed to in significant part , by extreme @xmath0 distributions , there are evidently physical phenomena affecting the generation of @xmath0 distributions that come into play at lower metallicities that are less important at higher metallicities .",
    "one may speculate on two possible causes .",
    "the first is some form of `` quenching '' of kappa distributions at higher metallicities .",

    "using the mappings photoionization code and a three - dimensional strmgren sphere model , we find that the ` standard ' equilibrium model ( @xmath67 , @xmath62 , @xmath41 , figure [ teza ] and equation [ eq7 ] ) does a good job of fitting the majority of the observational data points for oxygen abundances @xmath10 1/5 solar . there are a number of parameters that can be used to explain divergences in temperature from the equilibrium model for lower metallicities .",

    "in addition to this averaging process , other parameters impact on the measured spectra .",

    "increasing attention has been paid in recent years to the possibility of optically thin nebulae ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",

    "it is to be expected that some of the observations considered here exhibit characteristics readily explained by low values of the optical depth , @xmath47 .",
    "as we note , the radiation emitted from our optically thick model nebulae is brighter than from otherwise similar optically thin nebulae . for a distant hii  region , given the likelihood that some of a nebula will be optically thick and other parts optically thin , these regions will not be resolved , and the resultant spectrum is a weighted mean of the two . the summed or ` hybrid '",
    "result is skewed in favor of the brighter , optically thick contribution .",
    "thus any suggestion of optical thinness in the integrated spectra indicates a substantial fraction of the nebula is optically thin . the effect on apparent electron temperatures of these hybrid spectra",

    "the next most important parameter affecting how well the model t@xmath1 versus @xmath8 curves fit the observations is @xmath18 .",
    "the sigrid observations for objects whose electron densities , determined from the s  ii line ratios , are @xmath1020 @xmath24 lie consistently above the standard model ( @xmath16 = 8.5 , @xmath62 , @xmath41 , @xmath18 = 5 ) , and their positions on the plot are therefore readily explained by higher pressure and consequent higher electron densities ( figure [ tezpk ] ) .",
    "the nature of the uv spectral energy distribution of the ionizing star cluster is also of critical importance to the resulting nebular spectra , but it is one where the modeling process is probably least well developed .",
    "the photoionization models depend on there being reliable stellar spectral energy distribution models , and at low metallicities extensive stellar models are lacking .",
    "we use the starburst99 models that give reasonable high energy photon fluxes , but we are limited to a minimum oxygen abundance of 0.05 solar .",
    "this is an area where further work is important , to understand the behavior of low metallicity hii  regions affected by strong starburst events .",
    "the data considered here are consistent with the findings of @xcite that the ionization parameter decreases with increasing metallicity .",
    "finally , our models suggest that @xmath0 non - equilibrium electron energy distributions can generate high apparent electron temperatures , but if this is correct , it is not clear why their effect only becomes apparent at low metallicity .",
    "the three - dimensional diagnostic grid plots suggest that @xmath0 is a less satisfactory explanation for these high electron temperatures than a combination of low optical depth and higher pressure .",
    "in this paper we have explored the various parameters affecting the measurement of apparent electron temperatures in hii  regions .",
    "we have used the data for the sigrid observations from , the sdss data from , low metallicity emission line galaxy data from and for wolf - rayet galaxies from to demonstrate these effects .",
    "the standard equilibrium , optically thick model with @xmath16=8.5 fits the observations remarkably well .",
    "the deviations from the fit are slight for metallicities above 1/5 solar , and can be explained by other physical parameters coming into play . for the low metallicity objects considered here , the important parameters are the ionization parameter , @xmath16 , the optical thickness , @xmath47 , @xmath0 electron energies , and the pressure / density , specified by @xmath18 .",
    "the nature of the central ionization star cluster source is also important , but the models available for spectral energy distributions at low metallicity limit our exploration here .",
    "this is an important area for further investigation .",
    "we have developed diagnostic plots to identify objects that are not optically thick , and it is clear that some of the observations can be readily explained by this effect .",
    "other objects show clear evidence of the effects of higher electron densities .",
    "together , these two factors offer a plausible explanation of the observed data .",
    "while non - equilibrium @xmath0 electron energy distributions may affect the observations , they require very low values of @xmath0 in some cases , and an explanation for their disappearance at higher abundances .",
    "we have used modeling of three - dimensional grids to augment the standard two - dimensional diagnostics , and suggest that this is an area with considerable potential , given the right manipulative tools .",
    "we conclude that the highest measured electron temperatures that fall within the bounds of the fitting approximations can be satisfactorily explained by a combination of pressure ( @xmath74 6 ) and optically thin nebulae ( 8 @xmath75 ) .",
