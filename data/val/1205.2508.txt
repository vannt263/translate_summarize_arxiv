    "polynomial - in - time regression is one of the longest - established tools of time series analysis ( see jones  @xcite ) . in much empirical work ,",
    "especially when stochastic trends , such as unit roots , are also involved , only a linear trend is countenanced , or merely a constant intercept . on the other hand ,",
    "classical methods can test polynomial order when observations are equally spaced in time . with independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "normal errors , a particularly elegant way of achieving this , with finite sample validity , results from an orthogonal polynomial representation   the covariance matrix of the least - squares estimate ( lse ) is diagonalized , and contributions to the  @xmath0 statistic from individual regressors are i.i.d . ( see section  3.2.2 of anderson @xcite ) .",
    "asymptotic theory is valid under much wider conditions on the errors ; indeed from section  7.4 of grenander and rosenblatt @xcite , the lse is asymptotically efficient ( in the gauss  markov sense ) when the ( possibly non - gaussian ) errors are covariance stationary with spectral density bounded and bounded away from zero at zero frequency , as with short memory processes .",
    "polynomial models have also been extended to spatial lattice data ( see section  3.4 of cressie @xcite ) .",
    "polynomials are nevertheless restrictive .",
    "the weierstrass theorem justifies their uniform approximation of any continuous function over a compact interval , but seems less practically relevant the longer the data set .",
    "nonparametric smoothing may be unreliable in a series of moderate length , when instead richer parametric models than polynomials might be considered .",
    "one class that advantageously nests polynomials , which has received little theoretical attention , consists of `` generalized polynomial '' or `` power law '' models .",
    "with equally spaced time series observations @xmath1 , @xmath2 , consider @xmath3 where the @xmath4 and @xmath5 are real valued and all can be unknown , @xmath6 for all @xmath7 , and the zero - mean unobservable process @xmath8 is covariance stationary with short memory . for @xmath9 , @xmath5 would not be estimable ( whether @xmath4 were known or unknown ) because the corresponding signal is drowned by the noise . for @xmath10",
    ", @xmath5 is estimable but we omit this possibility because our central limit theorem requires @xmath4 to lie in the interior of a  compact set .",
    "polynomials , such as when @xmath11 for all @xmath7 , are nested ; indeed this is a  hypothesis that might be tested within  ( [ eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "we consider the nonlinear least - squares estimate ( nlse ) of the @xmath12 in ( [ eq1.1 ] ) and , more generally , of exponents and coefficients in an extended model defined on a lattice , applying to spatial and spatio - temporal data , where our provision , for example , for weaker trends than linear ones and for decaying trends seems practically useful . unlike the lse when exponents are known",
    ", the nlse can not be expressed in closed form and requires numerical optimization .",
    "correspondingly , asymptotic theory , with sample size  @xmath13 increasing , is needed to justify rules of statistical inference even when errors are gaussian .",
    "we establish consistency and asymptotic normality for the nlse of exponent and coefficient estimates , achieving also an analogous efficiency bound to that described above . as with other implicitly defined estimates",
    ", asymptotic distribution theory makes use ( in application of the mean value theorem ) of an initial consistency proof .",
    "many such proofs ( see jennrich  @xcite , malinvaud @xcite ) require regressors to be non - trending , whence under suitable additional conditions all parameter estimates are @xmath14-consistent . for the nlse of ( [ eq1.1 ] ) , wu @xcite significantly relaxed this requirement but nevertheless appears to heavily restrict the diversity of trends .",
    "the discussion after assumptions a and  a@xmath15 of wu @xcite indicates that they reduce in ( [ eq1.1 ] ) with known @xmath4 to the assumption @xmath16 , and no weaker requirement suffices in the case of unknown  @xmath4 .",
    "example 4 of wu @xcite addressed the latter case but with @xmath17 only ( and for @xmath18 $ ] ) when the inequality is trivially satisfied .",
    "in general , more elaborate techniques seem required to establish consistency in ( [ eq1.1 ] ) . moreover , wu @xcite established consistency with no rate , whereas we find that a slow rate of convergence in the @xmath4 estimates is required before asymptotic normality is established .",
    "wu @xcite also established asymptotic normality of the nlse in a quite general setting , but under the assumption that all parameter estimates converge at the same rate .",
    "this is not the case with ( [ eq1.1 ] ) ; indeed all rates of @xmath19 estimates turn out to differ .",
    "for implicitly defined extremum estimates such variation is typically associated with difficulty in the initial consistency proof due to the objective function not converging uniformly to a function that is uniquely optimized over the whole parameter space .",
    "consistency proofs here have tended to be geared to the case at hand ( see e.g. giraitis , hidalgo and robinson @xcite , nagaraj and fuller @xcite , nielsen @xcite , robinson @xcite , sun and phillips  @xcite ) .",
    "our consistency proof employs a generic result ( presented and proved in appendix to avoid interrupting the flow ) that seems likely to apply to a quite general class of estimates ( not just the nlse ) of a variety of models . our asymptotic distribution theory of estimates for ( [ eq1.1 ] ) and its extension presents some other unusual features .",
    "the following section presents the model , regularity conditions and three theorems describing asymptotic statistical properties .",
    "the main details of their proofs appear in appendix .",
    "these use a series of propositions , stated and proved in appendix , and relying in turn also on a series of lemmas , in appendix .",
