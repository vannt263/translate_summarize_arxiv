    "thousands of microlensing events in our galaxy have so far been discovered by ogle ( e.g. @xcite ) , macho ( e.g. @xcite ) , moa ( e.g. @xcite ) and eros ( e.g. @xcite ) , with many more detected every yearogle / ogle3/ews / ews.html ] .",
    "one of the most important measurements that can be made from these observations is of the optical depth , @xmath0  the probability of seeing a microlensing event .",
    "however , the measured value appears to depend strongly on the method used to obtain it .",
    "@xcite reported @xmath5 at @xmath6 , and more recently from the ogle - ii survey , @xcite found @xmath7 at @xmath8 .",
    "the macho value was based on the lensing of 42 red clump giants ( rcgs ) , and used standard photometric fitting .",
    "the ogle analysis instead used difference image analysis ( dia ) , but was similarly based on the lensing of 32 red giants , red super giants and rcgs , and obtained an optical depth consistent with the previous macho result .",
    "however , both these values are significantly lower than two other recent measurements , which were based on the lensing of all stars . using 28 dia events",

    "@xcite had previously found @xmath12 $ ] at @xmath13 , from 99 macho dia events .",
    "the latest measurement comes from the eros-2 survey of bulge rcgs , which yielded 120 events : @xcite give the trend @xmath14 \\times 10^{-6}$ ] , where @xmath15 , in the latitude range @xmath16 .",
    "this agrees well with previous eros values , and with the recent macho and ogle - ii measurements .",
    "the question naturally arises as to why the rcg - based optical depths appear to be lower than those from all stars .",
    "one possibility is a dependence on the flux limits of the two methods .",
    "rcgs are bright ; the latter method will include much fainter stars , and so probe sources at greater distances , which will have a higher optical depth ( @xcite ) .",
    "this potential explanation of the discrepancy is investigated using monte carlo simulations of galactic microlensing , and the optical depth as a function of source apparent magnitude is then predicted .",
    "the model galaxy is barred , and in light of observations by the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "( _ sst _ ) , that support a bar inclination angle much larger than suggested by previous studies ( see  [ sec : models ] ) , the effect on the expected @xmath0 of changing the bar angle is determined .",
    "combining these results with the observed optical depths , upper limits are placed on the bar angle .",
    " [ sec : model ] describes the model .",
    "the results and discussion are presented in ",
    "[ sec : results ] : the model results are given in  [ sec : results_model ] , and comparisons are made with the latest eros-2 data in  [ sec : results_eros ] . a summary and conclusions follow in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the mass models and parameters of the galactic bulge ( bar ) and disc are as described in @xcite .",
    "they are based on those of @xcite , who empirically normalised the g2 bulge model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) with _ hubble space telescope _ star counts , and extended the local disc model of @xcite to the whole disc .",
    "@xcite tested a series of models against images of the galactic bulge from the _ cosmic background explorer _ ( _ cobe _ ) satellite , and found their g2 model to provide one of the best fits .",
    "this model bar extends from 313 kpc and is inclined to the galactic centre line of sight ( los ) at an angle of @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite states that physical models can be found for the _ cobe _ bar with angles in the range @xmath18 , and many studies assume @xmath19 .",
    "however , more recent data from glimpse ( galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ) , using the _ sst _ , support a much larger value of @xmath20 ( @xcite ) , while from eros-2 , @xcite report @xmath21 , which is consistent with original ogle - i results ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , predictions are also made here for @xcite s e2 model , which has the largest bar angle of their models : @xmath22 .",
    "the expected @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are to be calculated .",
    "therefore for each los , the apparent magnitude distribution of the model sources must match the observed distribution .",
    "@xcite fitted the @xmath26-band stellar distributions in 48 ogle - ii galactic bulge fields with the power - law plus gaussian luminosity function @xmath27 , \\label{eq : powgauss}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are free parameters , and @xmath32 is measured as described in his paper .",
    "the power - law part contains red giants and bright main - sequence stars , which lie throughout the bar .",
    "the gaussian component consists of rcgs , which in the model here are more concentrated in the central part of the bulge , occupying the region 610 kpc .",
    "( this concentration is found to improve the match to the observed magnitude distributions , and is not unreasonable , as rcgs are older , evolved stars , and hence more likely to exist only in more densely populated regions ) .",
    "@xcite thus provides , for each of these fields , an observed distribution of apparent magnitude .",
    "the positions of these fields are listed in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "the fields closest to the ogle , macho ( rcg ) and moa lines of sight are selected , as shown in table [ tab : coords ] .",
    "the macho ( dia ) los is not considered , as explained below .",
    "lccc    & @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) & @xmath35 ( @xmath34 ) & angular separation ( @xmath34 ) +    ogle & 1.16 & @xmath36 & + field 34 & 1.35 & @xmath37 & 0.40 +   + macho & 1.50 & @xmath38 & + field 20 & 1.68 & @xmath39 & 0.28 +   + moa & 3.0 & @xmath40 & + field 36 & 3.16 & @xmath41 & 0.6 +    as described in ",
    "[ sec : opdepth ] , the apparent magnitude of each source is calculated by first assigning it an absolute magnitude , and then correcting for its distance .",
    "hence for each los a separate model distribution of absolute magnitude is required that will , with distance corrections , reproduce the observed distribution of apparent magnitude .",
    "of course in reality the absolute magnitude distribution should be virtually the same for each direction in table [ tab : coords ] , since over these small angular separations the mass function is expected to vary little . here",
    ", the artificial absolute magnitude distributions are only used as a means to ensure the model distributions of apparent magnitude match those observed for each direction .",
    "it is assumed that the forms of the two distributions are the same , i.e. a power - law plus gaussian .",
    "for each of the three ogle - ii fields listed in table [ tab : coords ] , an appropriate absolute magnitude distribution can easily be generated , by suitably adjusting the ( extinction - corrected ) fitted parameters of the apparent magnitude distribution found by @xcite .",
    "( these parameters are not given in @xcite , and are provided by t. sumi , private communication ) .",
    "* table 5 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 4 ) list the extinction - corrected @xmath26-band apparent magnitudes of all the moa and ogle sources used in their respective measurements of @xmath0 .",
    "the minimum and maximum magnitudes given in each case are taken to define ranges of detectable apparent magnitudes .",
    "@xcite , in their table 2 , provide uncorrected @xmath42-band apparent magnitudes .",
    "since these macho sources are all rcgs , their apparent magnitudes are converted to @xmath26-band using the following relation for rcgs from @xcite : @xmath43 macho source extinction is then accounted for by simply shifting the minimum and maximum macho magnitudes by the mean @xmath44 for the corresponding ogle - ii field , as given in table 3 of @xcite : for field 20 , @xmath44 = 0.951 .",
    "( strictly speaking the extinction should instead be calculated for each source individually , but this is neglected as in the region occupied by the model rcgs , @xmath44 varies from the mean value by @xmath45 0.05 mag  a negligible amount ) .",
    "although @xcite also list the apparent magnitudes of the macho sources used in their dia measurement , these are in @xmath42-band and do not consist of only rcgs",
    ". therefore an @xmath26-band magnitude range can not be reliably defined for the model .",
    "the defined ranges of detectable , extinction - corrected apparent magnitudes @xmath46 for ogle , macho and moa are given in table [ tab : mag_ranges ] .",
    ".defined ranges of detectable , extinction - corrected apparent magnitudes for ogle , macho and moa .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , there is another , simpler way to look for signs of the predicted @xmath0 oscillation in the survey data .",
    "if @xmath0 is indeed higher on the faint side of the clump centres , then more of the observed events should also be on the faint side : a plot of event counts , as a function of @xmath47 , should be noticeably skewed towards the faint side .",
    "[ fig : eros_skew ] shows that this is so .",
    "the ratio of events with @xmath47 fainter than zero to those brighter than zero ( hereafter the _ skewness ratio _ ) is 1.14 .",
    "the significance of this skew is tested as follows .",
    "the plot of event counts is fitted with a gaussian , as shown .",
    "this is of course an imperfect fit , but gives an approximate measure of the dispersion .",
    "then 120 points ( for the 120 eros events ) are randomly distributed on the magnitude axis , according to a gaussian with the fitted dispersion , and the skewness ratio is calculated . for one million such monte carlo cases ,",
    "only 21 per cent have a skewness ratio greater than the observed value .",
    "thus the observed skew is suggestive , but not highly significant .",
    "it does not appear that the discrepancy in optical depth measurements between the rcg and all - star analyses can be explained by a dependence of the lensing surveys on their flux limits .",
    "the model reproduces the ogle and macho values based on rcgs , but underpredicts moa s all - star value by @xmath48@xmath49 .",
    "another potential explanation for the discrepancy is blending . @xcite found @xmath4838 per cent of ogle - ii events with apparent rcg sources were really due to faint stars blended with a bright companion .",
    "however , they also showed that blending has little effect on estimates of @xmath0 due to partial cancellation of its different effects , a point also made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite also state that the dia method is less sensitive to the systematics of blending in crowded fields . though it is of course possible that moa s value may yet be lowered with more data , it is supported by macho s earlier dia value .",
    "@xmath0 is expected to be generally constant as a function of source apparent magnitude for @xmath50 , except in the range @xmath2 , where many rcgs are detected .",
    "these stars dominate the source counts at such magnitudes , and show a strong correlation between distance and apparent magnitude , causing a significant oscillation in @xmath0 .",
    "the amplitude of this oscillation is found to decrease with increasing bar angle , providing a potential constraint on @xmath3 .",
    "a further constraint comes from a similar dependance of @xmath0 with @xmath3 : combining the predicted trends with the measured values provides @xmath4 upper limits , which exclude the large bar angles reported by glimpse and eros .    from the eros-2 survey",
    ", @xmath51 has been found as a function of source apparent magnitude .",
    "the predicted oscillation is not only consistent with the observed trend , but provides a better @xmath52 fit than a constant optical depth , though the significance of this preference is low due to insufficient data .",
    "however , a further sign comes from eros event counts , which show a clear skew towards fainter magnitudes . with ongoing surveys detecting increasing numbers of rcg events ( and @xmath48@xmath53 of all kinds )",
    ", it should soon be possible to make a more useful and definite comparison .",
