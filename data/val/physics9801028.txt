    "fluid flow in porous media such as sand , soil and fractured rock is an important process in nature and has a huge number of practical applications in engineering .",
    "most often mentioned is oil recovery and hydrology .",
    "fluid flow in porous media has also been of great interest in modern physics . in particular , the different structures of the interface between the fluids in two - phase displacements have been extensively studied . despite this attention there are still many open questions concerning fluid flow in porous media .",
    "in this paper we report on simulations of the temporal evolution of pressure during two - phase drainage in a model porous medium , consisting of a two - dimensional lattice of tubes .",
    "the network model has been developed to measure the time dependence of different physical properties and to study the dynamics of the fluid movements .",
    "especially , we focus on the dynamics of the temporal evolution of the pressure due to capillary and viscous forces and the time dependence of the front between the two liquids . the discussion is restricted to drainage displacement , i.e.  the process where a non - wetting fluid displaces a wetting fluid in a porous medium .    during the last two decades an interplay between experimental results and numerical simulations",
    "has improved the understanding of the displacement process .",
    "it has been shown that the different structures observed when changing the physical parameters of the fluids like viscosity contrast , wettability , interfacial tension and displacement rate  @xcite divide into three flow regimes .",
    "these three major regimes are referred to as viscous fingering  @xcite stable displacement  @xcite and capillary fingering  @xcite .",
    "there exist statistical models such as dla  @xcite , anti - dla  @xcite and invasion percolation  @xcite that reproduce the basic domains in viscous fingering , stable displacement and capillary fingering respectively .",
    "however , these models do not contain any physical time for the front evolution and they can not describe the crossover between the different flow regimes .",
    "much effort has gone into making better models whose properties are closer to that of real porous media . this has resulted in several network simulators , modeling fluid flow on a lattice of pores and throats  @xcite .",
    "most of the network models have been used to obtain new information on the different flow regimes and to study the statistical properties of the displacement structures .",
    "some others , have been used to calculate macroscopic properties like fluid saturations and relative permeabilities and compare them with corresponding experimental data . however , to our knowledge no network model has been capable of simulating the dynamics of the fluid pressures during the displacement process . this is the goal of the present work .",
    "we have simulated the temporal evolution of the pressure in all the three regimes of interest : viscous fingering , stable displacement and capillary fingering .",
    "the injection rate in the displacements has been systematically varied and we have analyzed the behavior of the pressure in the crossover between the three regimes .",
    "moreover , we discuss what effect trapped clusters have on the evolution of the pressure in the system and we relate the data to macroscopic flow equations .",
    "we find that capillary forces play an important role in two - phase flow at both high and low injection rates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we present the network model , in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] we show the simulation results and in sec .  [ sec : discuss ] we present our conclusions and related the findings to macroscopic quantities .",
    "the network model has been presented in  @xcite and we will restrict ourself to a short sketch here .",
    "the porous medium is represented by a square lattice tubes connected at the nodes . at each node",
    "four tubes meet and there is no volume assigned to the nodes : the tubes represent the volume of both pores and throats .",
    "the tubes are cylindrical with length @xmath0 .",
    "each tube is assigned an average radius @xmath1 which is chosen at random in the interval , where @xmath2 .",
    "the randomness of the radii represents the disorder in the model .    the liquids flow from the bottom to the top of the lattice and we implement periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction .",
    "the pressure difference between the bottom row and the top row defines the pressure across the lattice .",
    "gravity effects are neglected , and consequently we consider horizontal flow in a two - dimensional network of tubes .",
    "initially , the system is filled with a defending fluid with viscosity @xmath3 .",
    "the invading fluid with viscosity @xmath4 is injected along the bottom row with a constant injection rate .",
    "we model drainage , i.e.  the invading fluid is non - wetting and the defending fluid is wetting .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the fluids are incompressible and immiscible .",
    "consequently , the volume flux is conserved everywhere in the lattice and a well defined interface develops between the two phases .",
    "the capillary pressure @xmath5 due to the interface between the non - wetting and wetting fluid inside a tube ( a meniscus ) is given by the young - laplace law @xmath6 here @xmath1 is the radius of the tube , @xmath7 is the interfacial tension and @xmath8 denotes the wetting angle between the non - wetting and wetting phases .",
    "@xmath8 is in the interval @xmath9 for drainage displacements .",
    "we assume that the tubes are hour glass shaped where the effective radii of the tubes follow a smooth function .",
    "thus , the capillary pressure becomes a function of the position of the meniscus in the tube and we assume that the young - laplace law  ( [ eq : pc ] ) takes the form @xmath10\\ .",

    "the set of equations is solved by using the conjugate gradient method  @xcite .",
    "we want to study the dynamics of the pressure fluctuations at constant displacement rate .",
    "therefore , we need to find the pressure across the lattice for a desired injection rate and then use that pressure to solve fluid flow through the network . for two - phase displacement the pressure across the lattice @xmath32",
    "is related to the injection rate @xmath33 through the equation @xmath34 here @xmath35 and @xmath36 are parameters depending on the geometry of the medium and the current configuration of the liquids .",
    "the first part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qdarcy ] ) is simply darcy s law for one phase flow , while the last part @xmath36 results from the capillary pressure between the two phases .",
    "as long as the menisci do not move @xmath36 is constant .",
    "the pressure @xmath37 across each tube can be related to the pressure across the lattice @xmath32 .",

    "a consequence @xmath37 becomes a function of @xmath32 , @xmath39 @xmath40 is a dimensionless quantity depending on the mobilities ( @xmath41 ) of the tubes and @xmath42 is a function of the capillary pressures of the menisci inside the tubes . if no menisci are present @xmath42 is zero .",

    "a time step @xmath54 is chosen such that every meniscus is allowed to travel at most a maximum step length @xmath55 during that time step . in each time step",
    "we check whether or not a meniscus crosses a node .",
    "if this happens , the time step is redefined such that this meniscus stops at the end of the tube .",
    "a meniscus reaching the end of a tube is moved into the neighbor tubes according to some defined rules .",
    "these rules take care of the different fluid arrangements that can appear around the node .",

    "the small distance @xmath56 avoids that the created menisci at position 2 immediately disappear and move back to the initial position 1 in tubes where the flow direction is opposite to the direction of the invading fluid .",

    "the total time lapse is recorded before the whole procedure is repeated for the new fluid configuration .",
    "in two - phase fluid displacement there are mainly three types of forces : viscous forces in the invading fluid , viscous forces in the defending fluid and capillary forces due to the interface between them .",

    "this is often referred to as capillary equilibrium leading to @xmath97 . however , in fast displacement the local capillary pressures are generally different .",
    "thus , for a large system with many menisci the average capillary pressure of the front will approach the average threshold pressure of the tubes .",
    "due to the less viscous defending fluid the pressure gradient at high injection rate is largest at the finger tip closest to the upper boundary of the lattice .",
    "the meniscus in the uppermost finger tip will therefor more likely continue and invade the next tube compared to the menisci lying behind it .",
    "thus , the menisci lying behind will get stuck and the fluctuations in the global capillary pressure can only be caused by the moving finger tip .",

    "we reach the regime of capillary fingering and similar to viscous fingering the pressures reduce to that describing the capillary fluctuations along the front .    to explain the rather unexpected behavior at high injection rates we have to discuss the effect of the trapped cluster of the defending fluid left behind the front . in stable displacement",
    "the driving pressure gradient lies between the inlet and the front causing a pressure drop between the top and the bottom of the trapped clusters . at moderate injection rates where the clusters stay in place and keep their shapes ,",
    "the forces due to the pressure drop must be canceled by capillary forces acting on the cluster menisci .",

    "fingering at high capillary numbers there are few clusters .",
    "thus , the extra contribution to @xmath71 from the cluster menisci becomes negligible . when the injection rate is reduced clusters develop , but now the pressure gradient across the clusters is small because of the low injection rate .",

    "[ fig : press - sd1 ] and  [ fig : press - sd2 ] @xmath106 is indicated by a vertical dashed line .",
    "if we neglect the fluctuations , @xmath32 and @xmath71 are approximately linear functions of time for @xmath107 .",
    "the linearity in @xmath71 is explained by looking at the generation of the clusters in the system .",
    "we notice that for large times ( @xmath107 ) , when the front has saturated with fully developed clusters behind it , the average front position @xmath108 can only depend on the injection rate and the viscosity ratio .",
    "both properties are constant through each simulation , resulting in @xmath108 being linear in time . a plot showing the average front position as a function of time at @xmath109 for the lattice with @xmath100 nodes is shown in fig .",
