    "_ oskar s maze _ , named after the dutch puzzle designer oskar van deventer , who invented it in 1983 , is a mechanical puzzle consisting of a hollow cube and three mutually orthogonal rods joined at their centers ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "each face of the cube has slits forming a maze , and the mazes on opposite faces are identical .",
    "each rod is orthogonal to a pair of opposite faces , and it is able to slide in the slits , tracing out the maze .",
    "hence , in order to move the rods around , one has to solve three mazes simultaneously .        in 1994 , hendrik w.  lenstra asked if the mazes could be chosen so that the common point of the three rods could trace a simple closed curve .",
    "observe that none of the mazes may contain any cycles , or some pieces of the cube would fall out of the puzzle .",
    "so , what lenstra was really asking for is a simple closed curve whose projections onto three pairwise orthogonal planes contain no cycles .",
    "in other words , he wanted the three shadows of a simple closed 3d curve to all be trees .",
    "as peter winkler reported in his book _ mathematical mind - benders _",
    "@xcite , a solution had already been found some years before by john r.  rickard , who discovered the curve illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] , also appearing on the front cover of winkler s book .",
    "several other , more complex solutions to lenstra s problem are known .",
    "notably , in 2012 adam p.  goucher constructed a simple closed curve having shadows that are all trees , which also happens to be a trefoil knot  @xcite .",
    "the curve was therefore named _",
    "treefoil_. goucher also constructed a pair of linked cycles whose union has shadows that are all trees .",
    "our research is motivated by the following two questions .",
    "is it possible for the three shadows of a simple closed curve to be paths , i.e. , have neither cycles nor branch points ? can the three shadows of a simple open curve be simple closed curves ?",
    "both these questions are related to lenstra s question , whose history is outlined in  @xcite .",
    "these questions have also been posed independently ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "[ [ our - contribution . ] ] our contribution .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in section  [ s : paths ] we answer the first question in the negative : the three shadows of a simple closed curve in @xmath1 can not all be paths .    in section  [ s :",
    "open ] we answer the second question in the affirmative : there exist simple open curves in @xmath1 whose three shadows are simple closed curves , although the shadows can not all be convex .",
    "furthermore , we exhibit a polygonal chain with this property having only six vertices , and we prove that six is the minimum .    in section  [ s : higher ]",
    "we extend rickard s curve to higher dimensions , giving an inductive construction of a @xmath3-sphere embedded in @xmath4 , for every @xmath2 , whose @xmath5 shadows are all contractible .",
    "( a contractible set is one that can be continuously shrunk to a point , and hence it has no holes . )    section  [ s : conclusions ] concludes the paper with some remarks and suggestions for further work .",
    "this research has obvious applications in computer vision and 3d object reconstruction , where the goal is to deduce properties of an unknown 3-dimensional object given its three projections .",
    "specifically , we may want to study the topology of an object that projects to three given paths .",
    "it is easy to see that such an object may not be unique , and hence it makes sense to study the set of 3-dimensional objects that are _ compatible _ with three given projections .",
    "observe that any such set is closed under taking unions , and therefore it has a unique `` largest '' object , which is the union of all the objects in the set .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are triplets of paths that are not compatible with any connected set , such as the one in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "this means that an oskars - maze - like puzzle could be `` unsolvable '' even if it had no crossroads on any face . by `` unsolvable '' we mean that the set of locations that are reachable by the central point of the three rods depends on where the rods are located .",
    "therefore , if we assign two points in the 3-dimensional maze determined by the three 2-dimensional mazes , it may be impossible to go from one to the other by moving the rods around .",
    "in this section we prove that the shadows of a simple closed curve in @xmath1 can not all be simple open curves .",
