    "xtej1118 + 480 is one of the most interesting soft x - ray transients ( sxt ) extensively studied over whole spectral range ( e.g. mcclinctock et al . 2001 ; wagner et al . 2001 ; frontera et al . 2001 ) .",
    "it is the first black hole binary detected in the galactic halo ( e.g. mirabel et al .",
    "it has one of the highest mass functions , @xmath1 ( mcclinctock et al .",
    "2001 ; wagner et al .",
    "2001 ) , and one of the lowest mass ratios , @xmath2 ( orosz 2001 ) .",
    "the optical counterpart of xtej1118 + 480 , kvuma has been classified as k5/7v star based on the optical / red spectroscopy ( e.g. mcclintock et al .",
    "2003 ; torres et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in the beginning of 2000",
    ", the binary underwent a bright outburst lasting several months , and another outburst has started in 2005 january ( e.g. zurita et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the optical light curves obtained during the 2000 outburst revealed the superhump periodicity of @xmath3 d , caused by precession of an eccentric accretion disk . on the other hand , photometry during late decline and near quiescence revealed characteristic ellipsoidal light variations of the secondary with the orbital period of @xmath4 d distorted by an additional modulation interpreted as due to the superhump having a period 0.3 per cent longer than the orbital one ( zurita et al .",

    "we report the first detection of the optical companion of xtej1118 + 480 in the near  infrared , when the system was in the quiescent state between the 2000 and 2005 outbursts .",
    "xtej1118 + 480 was observed on 2003 april 1 and 2 , and 2004 march 1518 with the cain ii infrared camera on the 1.54 m carlos sanchez telescope ( tcs ) at the observatorio del teide on tenerife .",
    "observations were made primarily through the @xmath5 filter , with an affective wavelength of 1.28 @xmath6 , as well as a small number with the @xmath7 ( short @xmath8 ) filter ( on 2004 march 17 and 18 ) , with an effective wavelength of 2.2 @xmath6 ( alonso , arribas & martinez - roger 1994 ) .",
    "typical integration times were 60s in 2003 , and 90s in 2004 , respectively .",
    "the individual images were reduced in the standard way , with the data reduction performed within iraf .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were obtained using aperture photometry with the iraf routine apphot . for calibration we used stars in the field of xtej1118 + 480 ( fig .  [ field ] ) selected from the 2mass catalogue , and the adopted magnitudes",

    "[ lcmar04 ] . whereas in the @xmath5",
    "filter the source was detected on a few @xmath17 level even on a single frame , a detection in @xmath8 filter was possible only after addition of all the frames , and the resulting magnitude was @xmath18 .",
    "the average @xmath19 is consistent with an m  type secondary although it is redder than expected for a late k or early m ",
    "type main sequence star ( leggeit 1992 ; straizys 1992 , and references therein ) , which may indicate the presence of an evolved secondary .",
    "similarly , our near ",
    "ir magnitudes combined with the quiescent optical magnitudes of the secondary , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( wagner et al . 2001 ) , are consistent with a k / m secondary .",
    "in particular , @xmath22 and @xmath23 indicate an old disc or halo m0/1 and m1v star , respectively , whereas @xmath24 and @xmath25 are consistent with a k7v and m0v star , respectively ( leggeit 1992 ) .",
    "all this suggests that the near  ir magnitudes are dominated by the secondary s light .",
    "the spectral type later than that derived from the optical / red spectra may be due to either the relative weakness of the absorption features in kvuma as compared with the k - m dwarf templates owing to very low metallicity ( e.g. frontera et al .",
    "2001 ) and/or due to an overestimated contribution of the accretion disc light .",
    "in fact , recent estimates of the quiescent average optical magnitudes , @xmath26 and @xmath27 orosz ( 2005 ) , as well as @xmath28 ( zurita et al .",
    "2002b ) , assuming the relative contribution of the secondary @xmath29 the @xmath30 ( mc clintock et al .",
    "2003 ) and @xmath31 to @xmath32 light ( torres et al .",
    "2004 ) give the secondary magnitudes , @xmath33 and @xmath34@xmath35 , and optical / near  ir colours consistent with an old disc / halo k7/m0v star ( leggeit 1992 ) .",
    "all our @xmath5 light curves ( fig .",
    "[ lcmar04 ] ) show modulation with a period of @xmath3 d , with minima roughly coinciding with the spectroscopic conjunctions of the secondary according to the ephemeris given by torres et al .",
    "the combined light curve folded on this orbital ephemeris and composed from all our data ( fig .",
    "[ lcfaz ] ) , however , does not reveal a simple ellipsoidal modulation expected for the roche  lobe filling star . instead , both its shape and apparent asymmetries are almost identical with those shown by the superhump modulation found by zurita et al .",
    "( 2002a ) in the optical light curves obtained during decline to quiescence , and shown in the bottom panel of their figure 3 .",
    "this result is very surprising because if the near  ir light curves are dominated by the superhump modulation , it is implausible that the light curves separated in time by @xmath36 year would be in the same phase of the orbital period , with the minima occuring at the time of spectroscopic conjunctions .",
    "moreover , the quiescent near  ir luminosity of xte 1118 + 480 is much higher than the quiescent optical and uv luminosity ( mcclintock et al .",
    "2004 ) which is inconsistent with the expected spectrum of an accretion disk emission .",
    "thus , most of the observed modulation presumably originates in the tidaly distorted secondary , although some contamination by the superhump modulation may also be present .",
    "the light curves will be analysed in detail and possible interpretations of their complex shape will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the presence of a roche - lobe filling secondary provides an excellent opportunity to accurately estimate the distance @xmath37 to xtej1118 + 480 for a roche - lobe filling secondary , we have ( eggleton 1983 ) : @xmath38 adopting the mass ratio @xmath39 ( orosz 2001 ) and the secondary s radial velocity amplitude @xmath40 km / s ( torres et al .",
    "2004 ) we estimate the system separation @xmath41 , the volume radius of the secondary @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "using the barnes - evans relation ( cahn @xcite ) , @xmath44 with the @xmath8 surface brightness , @xmath45 ( for @xmath46 and [ m / h]=0.5 ; beuermann et al .",
    "1999 ) , and @xmath47 ( average value ) , we estimate the secondary s angular diameter , @xmath48 , and the distance @xmath49 . the surface brightness is a function of metallicity , lower metallicity will push the distance to lower values ,",
    "the effect will , however , not exceed a few per cents .",
    "in particular , @xmath50 for [ m / h ] @xmath51 ( frontera et al . 2001 ) and @xmath52 kpc for [ m / h ] = 0 ( solar ) .",
    "the system is not eclipsing , so the inclination is @xmath53 .",
    "zurita et al .",
    "( 2002a ) estimate that @xmath54 lies in the range 7182@xmath55 based on analysis of the ellipsoidal light curve in the optical ( @xmath32 ) range .",
    "the presence of a strong orbital modulation in our @xmath5 light curves also indicates high @xmath56 .",
    "so , most likely @xmath57 , and @xmath58 kpc .",
    "this estimate assumes that there is no accretion disc contribution to the near  ir magnitudes .",
    "torres et al .",
    "( 2004 ; see also zurita et al .",
    "2002a ) found a constant @xmath59 contribution of light from the accretion disc to the quiescent optical red emission . adopting the quiescent magnitude @xmath6019 ( orosz 2005 ; zurita et al .",
    "2002b ) and assuming the frequency dependence of the disc emission , @xmath61 , we estimated the upper limit of such a contribution to the near  ir light of about 33% at @xmath5 and 25% at @xmath8 .",
    "this will set the upper limit for the distance to xtej1118 + 480 of @xmath62 kpc .",
    "the present estimate is not in conflict with the previous less accurate estimates of @xmath63 kpc ( mcclintock et al .",
    "2001 ) , and @xmath64 ( wagner et al . 2001 ) , respectively , based on optical spectral classification of the secondary .",
    "the major results and conclusions of this paper can be summarised as follows :        \\(iii ) the @xmath5 light show strong modulation with the orbital ephemeris of torres et al .",
    "the light curves , however , show significant departures from a simple ellipsoidal modulation .",
    "the nature of the complex form of the @xmath5 curve is not clear and needs further studies .",
