    "although defects below a metal surface can be visible in stm data for up to ten interatomic distances @xcite , the amplitude of the quantum oscillations in the conductance become very small with increasing defect depth .",
    "an effective way to enhance the stm sensitivity to such oscillation effects is to use a superconducting tip @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite using a low - temperature stm with normal metal tungsten tips and superconducting niobium tips , the formation of electron standing waves near surface defects and step edges on a au ( 111 ) surface have been observed .",
    "it was demonstrated that the amplitude of conductance oscillations is significantly enhanced when a superconducting tip is used , and when the applied bias @xmath4 is close to the gap energy @xmath5 of the superconductor .",
    "the investigation of various defects in superconductors with stm is of interest by itself .",

    "are used ( for a review , see @xcite ) , where it is assumed that the conductance of the small tunnel contact is proportional to the local density of electron states .",
    "while for subsurface defects this assumption remains qualitatively valid , it does not permit a correct description of the details of the conductance oscillations because the bulk electron density of states around the defect is modified by reflection from the interface , @xmath17 , and in the limit of zero tunnelling probability we have @xmath18 in this case , the problem of electron transmission through the small ns tunnel junction in the presence of the defect should be considered .    in this paper",
