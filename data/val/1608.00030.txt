    "multiferroic ( mf ) materials and composites possess simultaneously a multiple of primary ferroic orderings that are possibly coupled .",
    "the intense research interest in these materials is fueled by a multitude of potential applications as well as by the possibility of employing them as a testing ground for fundamental questions concerning the interplay between magnetism , electricity , electronic correlations , and symmetries .",
    "for example mf magnetoelectrics allow the control of the magnetic order by an external electric field ( in addition to a magnetic field ) by virtue of the magnetoelectric ( me ) coupling which renders new concept for data storage and read / write schemes , potentially at low - energy consumption .",
    "mf have a long history @xcite .",
    "their utilization were however hampered by the notoriously weak mf coupling .",
    "novel nano fabrication and characterization techniques , especially for heterostructures with stronger and controlled mf coupling gave a new impetus to the field with numerous findings and applications ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "[ ] and references therein ) .",
    "the underlying mechanisms for mf coupling are diverse .",
    "of special interest here is the ( spin - dependent ) charge driven me coupling in non - collinear magnetic compounds ( cf . ref .",
    "[ ] and references therein ) . for example , the perovskite type manganites rmno@xmath1 ( r = tb , dy , eu@xmath2y@xmath3 ) show in a certain temperature range a transversal helical ( cycloidal ) spin order and may exhibit a ferroelectric polarization which is determined by the topology of the spins @xcite .",
    "we will explore a particular issue , namely the functionalization of these mf materials and their special me coupling to time - dependent quantum information processing via electric thz pluses . in this context",
    ", we mention previous studies @xcite employing a _ static _ external electric field that were shown to enhance the quantum state transfer fidelity @xcite or / and the increase in efficiency of quantum heat engines @xcite based on spiral multiferroic working substance .",
    "the quantum dynamical response of these materials and a possible coherent control of the response , e.g. with e - field pulses , was not studied to our knowledge and is the topic of this study . in particular",
    "we are interested in the possibility of triggering dynamical quantum transition via external fields . in the vicinity of a dynamical quantum phase transition",
    "a system with an hamiltonian for which the eigenvalues depend analytically on the parameters may exhibit a non - analytic behavior when approaching the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a relevant experimental setup is a quantum quench , i.e. a sudden change of the driving parameter in the hamiltonian , or an electromagnetic pulse ( see below ) .",
    "recently the connection between the singularities in the nonequilibrium dynamics of a quantum system and the theory of equilibrium phase transitions was discussed @xcite .",
    "relevant issue is the well - established theorem of lee and yang @xcite concerning the connection of the zeros of the equilibrium partition function when continued to complex conjugate fields or to the complex temperature plane .",
    "we refer also to the pioneering works of s.  grossmann , w.  rosenhauer and m.  e.  fisher @xcite .",
    "experimental observations of the lee - yang zeros was reported in ref .",
    "[ ] . in the context of this work we refer to refs.@xcite where it has been argued that the dynamical quantum phase transitions are indicated by changes in the zeros of rate function of the return probability of the loschmidt echo .    in order to identify true quantum phase transitions and separate them from resonance related phenomena the robustness of the transition with respect to the system s size should be checked .",
    "furthermore , also in the equilibrium case , the term `` phase transition '' in a finite system refers to precursors of a real phase transitions occurring in the thermodynamic limit . yet",
    ", this criterion is not universal as it applies only to cases where such a thermodynamic limit really exists . in some cases achieving the thermodynamic limit is not possible at all . a typical example",
    "are sodium clusters @xcite or ferrofluid clusters @xcite .",
    "the same behavior occurs in other complex finite systems as well , for example for atomic nuclei @xcite . in these materials",
    "the nature of phase transitions changes with increasing the system s size .",
    "therefore , achieving the thermodynamic limit for certain systems which do not have universal scaling properties is questionable .",
    "phase transitions in finite systems have been the subject of numerous recent works , e.g. refs .",
    "dynamical phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit can be detected using transfer matrix approach @xcite .",
    "a combination of the above aspects will be relevant for the present project , as we will be interested in quantum transitions in a field driven , chiral mf system . the so - called quench dynamic , i.e. a sudden change in the hamiltonian governing the system has been recently in the focus of research @xcite .",
    "the present work shows that exposing the system to short thz pulses , that are already feasible , result in similar collective transition phenomena .",
    "the pulses offer in addition the possibility to coherently control the pathways for these transitions .",
    "special attention is devoted to a specific chiral spin order formation and its dependence on the external field .",
    "the competition between the spin exchange and the spin - orbital coupling ( dzyloshinski - moriya interactions ) that is naturally rooted in these compounds is the source for the formation of the chiral ground state .",
    "the emergent electric polarization @xmath4 is akin to the non - collinear spin order as it is proportional to @xmath5 , and hence @xmath4 disappears in the collinear case of a fully aligned ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "here @xmath6 is the unit vector connecting neighboring spins .",
    "the vector spin chirality @xmath7 is a quantitative characteristic measure of the chiral state .",
    "if the chirality is zero , @xmath8 , the system turns insensitive to an electric field .",
    "switching of a magnetic order by an optical pulse reduces significantly the time scale required for a quantum information processing .",
    "on the other hand an optical pulse may lead to a strong structural change in the mf ground state and eventually to a lose of quantum coherence , which is a vital ingredient for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the robustness of the ground state upon the application of an optical pulse is another issue of concern .",
    "e.g. , in the experiments of refs .",
    "[ ] the nonequilibrium increase in magnetic disorder were induced by femtosecond laser pulse . after applying a pulse in the range of @xmath9  femtoseconds ( fs ) to @xmath10  picoseconds ( ps ) a transition from the commensurate phase to a spiral incommensurate phase",
    "was observed @xcite . by commensurate / incommensurate transition we refer to not only the geometry of the non - collinear spin configuration formed after a quench ( pulse ) , but as well to the characteristic frequencies of the states @xmath11 involved in the dynamics ( @xmath12 is the ground state ) .",
    "we are particularly interested in the latter aspect of the commensurability of the characteristic frequencies .",
    "we note in this context that in a finite quantum system , quantum revivals are closely related to the commensurability between different characteristic frequencies of the system @xcite .",
    "if the system after the pulse ( quench ) turns into an incommensurate frequency phase a periodic or a quasi - periodic quantum revival in chirality are not expected .",
    "chirality and entanglement are interrelated and chirality can be considered as a witness of quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "the model under study fulfills both requirements : the system can be manipulated by optical pulse and by a sudden quench .",
    "we will inspect the chiral state formed in the system after the action of pulse excitations or a sudden quench by studying a periodic in time quantum revivals in the chirality and entanglement .",
    "our model is relevant for the one phase chiral mf , e.g. , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "depending on the system size we were able to perform full analytical calculations for the time propagation and extract some trends for the entanglement and chirality evolution and to relate that to the underlying physics . for larger systems we resort to full numerical exact diagonalization methods .",
    "for more insight we will inspect equal - time spin - spin and chirality - chirality correlation functions .",
    "in particular our interest concerns chirality , a quantity which is an order parameter for one phase mf system and is related to the ferroelectric polarization of the mf systems .",
    "any remarkable change in chirality that might occur during the dynamical phase transition is of high experimental relevance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : model ] introduces the model and basic notation , section  [ sec : numsim ] presents results of the numerical calculations for several entanglement witnesses such as : concurrence , von  neumann entropy , one and two tangle . in section  [ sec : dynamicalpt ] we study the dynamical quantum transitions . using weierstrass factorization technique we will study the zeros of the rate function of the loschmidt echo .",
    "we also inspect the vector chiral and nematic phases of the system and the spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional quantum spin chain along the @xmath16 axis with a charge - driven multiferroicity .",
    "the chain is subjected to pulses of an electric field @xmath17 that is linearly polarized along the @xmath18 axis .",
    "additionally , an external magnetic field @xmath19 is applied along the @xmath20 axis .",
    "this coordinate system applies both to the spin and charge dynamics .",
    "a hamiltonian capturing this situation reads @xmath21 the nearest neighbor exchange coupling of a spin @xmath22 ( denoted @xmath23 ) localized at site @xmath24 is ferromagnetic @xmath25 , while next - nearest neighbor interaction is antiferromagnetic @xmath26 .",
    "we consider periodic boundary conditions such that @xmath27 . the time dependent electric field @xmath17 couples to the electric polarization as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the magnetoelectric coupling strength .",
    "the quantity @xmath30 is the @xmath20 ( longitudinal ) component of the vector chirality ( vc ) . in absences of frustration ( @xmath31 ) ,",
    "i.e. for co - linear spin order , @xmath32 and @xmath33 vanish , and the chain does not react to @xmath34 .",
    "the ground - state and the dynamical properties of the parent hamiltonian systems ( @xmath35 ) , the so called frustrated ferromagnetic spin @xmath36 heisenberg chains , have been widely discussed in the literature @xcite . the phase diagram for a wide range of parameters and net magnetization",
    "have been studied @xcite , and was found to exhibit a rich variety of phases , including vector chiral phase , the nematic phase , and other multipolar phases . here we will focus on the _ time - dependent dynamics _ of the system with the spin - orbital coupling ( @xmath37 ) in the vicinity of the saturated magnetization for the fixed ratio of the spin - exchange couplings .",
    "each term of the hamiltonian @xmath38 ( eq .  ) commutes with the total @xmath20-component of the spin , @xmath39 .",
    "hence @xmath40 is a good quantum number and any eigenstate of the system can be characterized by the total number of ` down ' ( or ` up ' ) spins in the studied system . in this manuscript",
    "we adopt the term `` @xmath41-excitations '' in order to denote the number of @xmath41 ` down ' spins .",
    "for instance @xmath41-excitations spin state means @xmath42 ( in units of @xmath43 ) , where @xmath44 . in the case of only ferromagnetic interaction",
    ", zero excitation spin state corresponds to a fully aligned ( saturated ) ferromagnetic ground state of the system .",
    "the effective model hamiltonian ( eq .  ) is relevant for 1d spin frustrated mf oxides , e.g. licu@xmath45o@xmath46 .",
    "typical values of the relevant parameters are @xmath47 ; e.g. for licu@xmath45o@xmath46 one finds @xcite @xmath48 mev and @xmath49 mev . for clarity",
    "we adopt dimensionless units and measure energies in units of @xmath50 . the time is measured in units of @xmath51 which typically in the range of @xmath52[ps ] .    for coherent control of the system on a ps time scale , we apply terahertz ( thz ) electric field pulses with a dc component , i.e. we use an electric field @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are respectively static and time - dependent electric fields , both linearly polarized along the @xmath18 axis .",
    "the hamiltonian of the driven system can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the unperturbed hamiltonian with the static electric field @xmath54 @xmath58 and @xmath59 the system is subjected at @xmath60 to a pulse of a rectangular shape , i.e. @xmath61 the width of the applied pulse is @xmath62 which translates in si units to @xmath63[ps ] .    for small @xmath64 ,",
    "it is reminiscent to a @xmath65-kick with the strength @xmath66 .",
    "small @xmath64 means here that the pulse is shorter than the transition times between those states of the spectrum that are involved in the dynamics .",
    "hence , we can assess this condition a posterior , i.e. after having diagonalized the hamiltonian and figured out the highest pulse excited levels .",
    "it is worth noting that such pulses can be realized as a sequence of highly asymmetric ( in time ) propagating single cycle thz pulses .",
    "the one strong and short half cycle acts as the  pulse \" in eq .",
    "and the second long and flat half cycle serves as the dc field ( cf .",

    "after rescaling the time @xmath73 , ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ; @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) and within the short - pulse assumption , as explained above , we find the state of the system right after the pulse to be governed by the magnus - type propagation @xcite @xmath78 where the operator @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 we note , that expression ( 7 ) includes all non - linear terms in the electric fields strength ( as long as the short - pulse approximation is viable @xcite ) and can deal thus with intense - field dynamics .",
    "after the pulse the system evolves in time under the action of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the state at any arbitrary time @xmath81 after the pulse can be written as @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the eigenstates and corresponding eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath85 ( eq .",

    "@xmath88 will replace @xmath86 in eq .  .",
    "the propagation scheme does not allow for any insight in what happens during the pulse .",
    "alternatively we also consider scenario when we suddenly quench the electric field . here",
    "we again consider the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian2 ] ) , but the protocol of the time evolution is as follows : for @xmath89 the system is given by @xmath90 and at @xmath87 it is suddenly quenched to @xmath91 .",

    "also the even(odd)-excitations initial states follow a similar pattern of oscillations which differs from odd(even)-excitations initial state case .    to quantify the entanglement we use one- and two - tangle as a measure of non - local and local correlations in the system@xcite .",
    "one - tangle is given by @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the reduced density matrix for a single spin after tracing out the rest , and two - tangle reads @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the number of spins , @xmath107 is the pair concurrence between spins @xmath41 and @xmath108 in the system , defined as @xmath109 @xmath110 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath111 and @xmath112 is the reduced density matrix of the system obtained from the density matrix @xmath113 after retaining spins at @xmath41 and @xmath108 positions and tracing out the rest . for the four spin system with ground states @xmath114 or @xmath115",

    "the chirality shows a more elaborate time evolution as compared to @xmath99 .",

    "for @xmath123 the two - tangle almost disappears during the pulse - free time evolution .",
    "thus local entanglement is less robust and does not survive after significant pulse induced changes in the system .",

    "<S> quantum dynamics of magnetic order in a chiral multiferroic chain is studied . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two different scenarios : ultrashort terahertz ( thz ) excitations or a sudden electric field quench . performing analytical and numerical exact diagonalization calculations we trace the pulse induced spin dynamics and extract quantities that are relevant to quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we analyze the dynamics of the system chirality , the von  neumann entropy , the pairwise and the many body entanglement . if the characteristic frequencies of the generated states are non - commensurate then a partial loss of pair concurrence occurs . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the system size this effect becomes even more pronounced . </S>",
    "<S> many particle entanglement and chirality are robust and persist in the incommensurate phase . to analyze the dynamical quantum transitions for the quenched and pulsed dynamics we combined the weierstrass factorization technique for entire functions and lanczos exact diagonalization method . for a small system we obtained analytical results including the rate function of loschmidt echo . </S>",
    "<S> exact numerical calculations for a system up to @xmath0 spins confirm phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> quench - induced dynamical transitions have been extensively studied recently . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that related dynamical transitions can be achieved and controlled by appropriate electric field pulses . </S>"
