    "these results suggest that a thorough comparison of the predictions offered by the exact pairing solutions averaged within three principal thermodynamic ensembles , and those given by the recent microscopic approaches , which include fluctuations around the thermal pairing mean field in nuclei , might be timely and useful .",
