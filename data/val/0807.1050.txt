    "oscillators directly generating femtosecond pulses with energy exceeding 100 nj are of interest for numerous applications including frequency conversion , metrology , micro - machining , etc . nowadays",
    "oscillators operating at mhz - repetition rates have reached the micro - joule pulse energy frontier without an extra - resonator amplification .",
    "an ingenious idea allowing such an advance is the pulse stretching , that suppresses the instabilities inherent to the high - peak - power oscillators @xcite .",
    "since the pulse is soliton in the negative group - delay - dispersion ( gdd ) regime , its stretching is linearly irreversible .",
    "the issue of pulse compressibility can be solved by a chirped - pulse oscillator ( cpo ) providing : i ) sufficient pulse stretching ( few picoseconds ) , ii ) broad spectrum ( more than 100 nm ) , and iii ) pulse compressibility down to few tens of femtoseconds @xcite .",
    "the remaining issue is that a high - energy oscillator ( including cpo ) is stable only within a confined region of gdd and pulse energy .",
    "the existing theory @xcite predicts that some minimum positive gdd is required for the cpo stabilization against the cw - amplification and this `` threshold '' gdd increases with the energy .",
    "it was found , that the gain saturation is a key factor determining the oscillator stability .",
    "however , the existing models do not take into account the gain dynamics and , thereby , some substantial features of the regime remain unexplored .",
    "for instance , it is unclear why the region of gdd and energy , where a single stable pulse exists , is confined @xcite .    here , for the first time to our knowledge ,",
    "the theory of cpo taking into account the gain dynamics will be presented .",
    "as it will be shown , the gain dynamics provides an explanation for the confinement of the pulse stability region .",
    "the model demonstrates an existence of two main mechanisms of pulse destabilization : the satellite rise in front of the pulse and the cw - amplification .",
    "the cpo conception is based on the pulse energy ( @xmath0 ) scaling with the scaling of resonator period ( @xmath1 ) : @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the averaged power ) .",
    "since the pulse peak power ( @xmath4 ) scales with the energy : @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the pulse width ) , one has to stretch the pulse ( i.e. , to increase @xmath6 ) in order to reduce @xmath4 and , thereby , suppress the instabilities causing by the nonlinear effects inside a resonator ( e.g. , the self - focusing inside an active medium ) .",
    "however , in the solitonic regime ( i.e. , when the gdd is negative ) , such a stretching is linearly irreversible .",
    "this means that the femtosecond high - energy pulse can be produced by only nonlinear compression , which worsens its characteristics ( e.g. , enhances the noise ) . in the cpo",
    ", the picosecond pulse has an extremely wide spectrum due to large chirp . as a result ,",
    "the pulse is linearly compressible down to @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the pulse spectrum width ) .",
    "the experiments demonstrate that such a regime is very stable and reproducible @xcite .",
    "the pulse stability in the cpo can be explained by the combined action of two mechanisms : a pure phase mechanism and a frequency - dissipative one .",
    "the first mechanism is the balance of phase contributions from the pulse envelope @xmath9 : @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the gdd coefficient , @xmath12 is the local time ranging from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ) and the time - dependent phase @xmath15 : @xmath16 ^ 2 $ ] @xcite . such a balance is possible if the pulse is chirped . however , a pure phase balance is not sufficient for pulse stabilization as the pulse spreads , i.e. some dissipative effects are required to form a quasi - soliton .",
    "the pulse lengthening due to gdd can be compensated by its shortening owing to frequency filtering if the pulse is chirped @xcite .",
    "the chirp results in frequency deviation at the pulse front and tail , and the filter cuts off the high- and low - frequency wings of the pulse , thus the pulse shortens .    the cpo can be described on the basis of the distributed generalized complex cubic - quintic nonlinear ginzburg - landau model @xcite :    @xmath17 + \\left [ { \\left ( { \\kappa   - i\\gamma } \\right)p(z , t ) - \\kappa \\zeta p(z , t)^2 } \\right]a(z , t).\\ ] ]    here @xmath18 is the propagation distance normalized to the cavity length ( i.e. , the cavity round - trip number , in fact ) .",
    "@xmath19 is the instant power , @xmath20 is the square of the inverse spectral filter bandwidth .",
    "the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the self - phase and self - amplitude modulation coefficients , respectively .",
    "parameter @xmath23 describes saturation of the self - amplitude modulation . in a broadband solid - state oscillator , for example",
    ", parameter @xmath20 is the square of the inverse gain band width multiplied by the saturated gain coefficient .",
    "parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are defined by the kerr - lens mode locking mechanism @xcite .    the @xmath24-parameter is the spectrally independent saturable net - loss coefficient , which depends on the instant pulse energy @xmath25 .",
    "below , such a dependence will be referred as the dynamic gain saturation .",
    "it was found @xcite , that a heavily - chirped pulse in cpo can be described as the soliton - like solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) in the limit of time - independent @xmath24 . in this case , the simplest energy - dependence of the @xmath24-parameter is @xmath26    where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the spectrum of the chirped soliton - like pulse has a lorentz profile truncated at some frequency @xmath30 , where the central frequency @xmath310 corresponds to the cpo carrier frequency @xcite .",
    "the chirped soliton - like pulse is stable within the region of its existence , i.e. within the region of @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "positivity of @xmath24 , i.e. stability against the cw - amplification ( vacuum stability ) , can be provided by a certain minimum positive gdd growing with energy .",
    "nevertheless , the existing theory does not take into account the time dependence of @xmath24 provided by the dynamic gain saturation .",
    "let us consider some numerical estimations .",
    "the gain saturation fluency for a ti : sapphire oscillator is @xmath330.8 j/@xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the emission cross - section , @xmath36 is the emission frequency , @xmath37 is the planck s constant ) .",
    "then , the gain variation due to gain saturation per one resonator round - trip is @xmath380.2 ( @xmath391 ps , the mode area @xmath40 equals to 130 @xmath41m@xmath42 , @xmath43200 nj ; and the peak power is close to the stability limit , which is defined by the self - phase modulation coefficient @xmath444.5 mw@xmath45 ) . that is the gain variation per one cavity round - trip",
    "is not negligible unlike that in a low - energy femtosecond oscillator operating in the solitonic regime .",
    "below , the extended theory of cpo taking into account the dynamic gain saturation will be considered .",
    "the cubic nonlinear limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) admits the chirped soliton - like solution @xcite : @xmath46^{1 + i\\psi } \\exp \\left [ { i\\omega \\left ( { t - \\upsilon z } \\right ) } + i\\phi z   \\right],\\ ] ] which is frequency ( @xmath47)- and phase ( @xmath48)-shifted and time - delayed ( @xmath49 ) in the presence of the dynamic gain saturation ( @xmath50 is the dimensionless chirp ) :    @xmath51    the pulse parameters are :    @xmath52    in eq . ( [ eq4 ] )",
    "@xmath53 is the net - loss coefficient , @xmath54 is the gain at the pulse peak taking into account its time - delay with propagation , @xmath55 .",
    "one can see a clear manifestation of the dynamic gain saturation : the time - delay and the frequency shift appear .",
    "[ f1 ] shows the gdd - dependence of the chirp parameter @xmath50 for two fixed @xmath22 .",
    "one can see , that the chirp ( @xmath56 ) increases with gdd and its value is sufficiently large to provide an efficient compression ( the pulse width after compression is @xmath57 ) .",
    "growth of the self - amplitude modulation decreases @xmath56 due to reduction of the relative contribution of the self - phase modulation in comparison with the self - amplitude modulation .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     on the other hand , both gdd and pump decrease destabilizes the pulse , as well ( @xmath58 in figs .",
    "[ f3],[f4],[f6 ] ) .",
    "the destabilizing mechanism is an appearance of satellite in front of the pulse ( dashed curve in figs .",
    "[ f3 ] ) . as a result of the dynamic gain saturation , the energy transfer from the pulse to satellite destabilizes the cpo .",
    "to determine the operational range of cpo in terms of dispersion and energy variations , an effect of the dynamic gain saturation on the cpo stability has been studied numerically for the first time to our knowledge .",
    "it has been found , that the dynamic gain saturation has a strong impact on a cpo dynamics in contrast to a low - energy (  10 nj ) mode - locked solid - state oscillator .",
    "first , there is some minimum positive net - gdd providing the oscillator stabilization . below this value",
    "the pulse is destroyed by excitation of the satellite before the pulse .",
    "such a satellite is clearly visible in the experiment and can co - exist stably with the pulse within some narrow gdd - range .",
    "second , there is some maximum gdd and its excess fragments the pulse front owing to the cw - amplification .",
    "third , the highest pulse energy at a given repetition rate is limited because the maximum and minimum gdds stabilizing the pulse merge .",
