    "an elastic interface driven through a disordered energy landscape is a generic model for many different physical systems , as domain walls in ferromagnetic materials @xcite , wetting fronts on a rough substrate @xcite , and seismic fault dynamics @xcite .",
    "the characteristic feature of the dynamics of slowly driven elastic interfaces is its evolution through a sequence of abrupt events , called avalanches . in the presence of viscoelastic effects , interface depinning has additional interesting physical properties @xcite , one of them being the existence of aftershocks , namely secondary avalanches originated in the internal viscoelastic dynamics , that are not directly related to the external driving .",
    "the prominent example of a physical system in which aftershocks show up is the seismic phenomenon@xcite .",
    "there , aftershocks are so abundant ( they may even represent the numerical majority of the events ) that strong statistical regularities are well established for them since many years ago .",
    "the most famous of these empirical observations is the omori ( or omori - utsu ) law @xcite , stating that the aftershock rate ( the number of aftershocks per unit of time ) @xmath0 after a main shock decays as    @xmath1    here time is measured from the time of the main shock , and @xmath2 , @xmath3 are phenomenological parameters .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is typically in the range of minutes .",
    "the most interesting physical information contained in the omori law is the fact that for @xmath4 , @xmath0 decays as a power law with an exponent @xmath2 . experimentally , although typically a value of @xmath2 around 1 is referred to , a much wider range of values ( between 0.9 and 1.5 according to @xcite ) has been observed .",
    "also it has to be taken into account that the fitting of experimental data with the power law ( [ omori ] ) has usually important deviations . in spite of this",
    ", the fact that the aftershock rate is roughly a power law with time is well established .",
    "there have been different proposals for the physical origin of aftershocks .",
    "some studies @xcite have claimed that they are related to aseismic afterslip occurring after large quakes .",
    "evidence for this mechanism is not compelling . in any case",
    ", the model we will study does not include the possibility of afterslip , meaning that the aftershocks we will observe are not related to this physical mechanism .",
    "the most accepted theory of aftershock production follows the analysis in @xcite . after a main shock",
    ", some parts of the fault close to the ruptured region are suddenly loaded to higher values of stress .",
    "this can produce the failure of these regions in a finite time , according to the mechanisms of static fatigue rupture . within this framework ,",
    "the omori law has been derived by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "note that according to this mechanism , aftershocks should mostly appear outside and nearby the region affected by the main shock .    in the last years",
    ", it has been shown that the statistical properties of earthquakes in single fault systems can be well described by the avalanches observed in viscoelastic models of interface depinning @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that these kind of models are able to reproduce many statistical properties of earthquakes , like the gutenberg - richter law with a realistic @xmath5 exponent , and also friction properties of the system compatible with experimental observations and with the predictions of the phenomenological rate - and - state equations@xcite .",
    "in addition , these models display aftershocks that qualitatively resemble real ones .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to study in detail the aftershock rate in these kind of models , and see whether this rate is compatible with the omori law or not .",
    "the models we study here are based on the standard quenched edwards - wilkinson ( qew ) model that describes the dynamics of a purely elastic interface on a disordered substrate @xcite . a schematic pictorial view of this model is presented in fig .",
    "[ f1](a ) . for simplicity",
    "the sketch is made for the one - dimensional case , but we will discuss the two - dimensional case throughout the paper , which is the appropriate case for the seismic context .",
    "the dynamical state of the model is described by the coordinates @xmath6 at every spatial position @xmath7 .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath8 as the total elastic force exerted over the site @xmath7 , except the force exerted by the @xmath9 springs . in the present case",
    "this is given by @xmath10 here , @xmath11",
    "( @xmath12 being the neighbor sites to @xmath7 ) is the discrete laplacian operator .",
    "the driving velocity @xmath13 is supposed to be vanishingly small compared with the dynamics of the @xmath6 variables .",
    "this means that avalanches are instantaneous in the time scale of driving , a condition that is quite well satisfied in actual seismicity . for numerical convenience",
    "we consider a case in which the substrate potential is a collection of discrete narrow wells at which the interface ( through the variables @xmath6 ) can be trapped .",
    "each well is characterized by the maximum force @xmath14 that it can apply on the surface .",
    "the actual pinning force @xmath15 can not overpass this maximum value . in mechanical equilibrium ,",
    "the force on each @xmath6 must balance , and in our narrow well limit this means @xmath16        the dynamics of the model in the narrow well approximation can be stated as a set of rules for the evolution of the forces @xmath8 acting on each site @xmath7 @xcite . on a stationary configuration satisfying ( [ equi ] ) ,",
    "time increases until @xmath17 for some @xmath7 . at this stage",
    "the corresponding @xmath6 jumps to the next potential well located at @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is taken from a random distribution , defined in the appendix ) . due to this rearrangement , and according to ( [ fi ] ) , the forces @xmath20 are modified as @xmath21 where @xmath12 are the four sites ( in two dimensions ) neighbor to @xmath7 .",
    "this can generate a cascade of rearrangements that represents an earthquake in the model .",
    "the avalanche finishes when the stability condition ( [ equi ] ) holds again at every site .    in general terms ,",
    "viscoelastic relaxation is a mechanism by which the mechanical energy of the system tends to be reduced in time , taking the system to more relaxed configurations .",
    "the existence of these mechanisms is well documented in the earthquake context , and have manifestations at the laboratory scale , where for instance they are responsible for the slow increase in time of the real contact area between two solid bodies at rest@xcite . within the context of our numerical models , these mechanisms",
    "can be conveniently represented by additional terms in the time evolution equation of the model . in some cases",
    ", they can be graphically represented by means of linear viscoelastic elements .",
    "it is not obvious _ a priori _ what is the exact form of the viscoelastic terms that must be used to model seismic processes in the most accurate way .",
    "it is for this reason that we consider two different forms of the relaxation mechanism that display different properties for the aftershock activity .",
    "they are graphically represented in fig .",
    "[ f1](b - c ) .",
    "the viscous elements are all identical and characterized by a viscosity coefficient @xmath22 .",
    "the main difference between the two models is that the one in fig .",
    "[ f1](b ) has a single time constant for relaxation , whereas that in fig .",
    "[ f1](c ) has a distribution of relaxation times depending on wave length .",
    "similarly to the case of the qew model , we define @xmath8 as the total ( visco-)elastic force exerted on the site @xmath7 , except the force applied by @xmath9 springs , so that eq .",
    "( [ equi ] ) is the stability condition for the viscoelastic versions also .",
    "however , even if the values of @xmath6 remain fix ( i.e. , as long as @xmath23 for all @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 s are no longer constant , but evolve in time according to@xcite    @xmath24    as in the qew model , an avalanche occurs each time @xmath17 for some @xmath7 .",
    "the time scale of relaxation @xmath25 is supposed to be very large compared with the time scale of the individual avalanches , namely we continue to consider avalanches as instantaneous .",
    "therefore , equations ( [ avalanche1 ] ) continue to be valid in the viscoelastic case , as dashpots are rigid during the avalanche development .    since @xmath8",
    "depend on time even if @xmath6 are constant , the triggering of an avalanche is now a combined effect of the driving and the viscoelastic dynamics of the system , respectively represented by the two terms on the l.h.s . of ( [ equi ] ) . only in the case",
    "in which @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is the average separation between potential wells ) we have a complete separation of time scales , and we can tell which term is the immediate responsible for each triggered event .",
    "we will consider this limiting case from now on . in these conditions ,",
    "the avalanches are clustered in time . each cluster",
    "is initiated by the driving term .",
    "all the remaining events within the cluster are aftershocks , that are triggered by the relaxation term .",
    "note that the first event is not necessarily the largest one in the cluster .",
    "an example of a time sequence of events obtained by numerical simulations of model a is shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . in real seismicity",
    "the time scales of driving and relaxation are not totally separated , and a clear cut identification of aftershocks is not possible . although it is not our main concern here , it is necessary to mention that both models a and b produce a gutenberg - richter distribution of number of earthquakes as a function of size , with a realistic value of the @xmath5 exponent .     of the avalanches ( see definition in appendix ) as a function of time , for the case of model a ( fig . [ f1](b ) ) .",
    "the time axis is scaled by the driving velocity @xmath13 , so all aftershocks appear on the same vertical line . in ( b ) and ( c ) , we take particular clusters of events in ( a ) and plot them as a function of the time , in units of the relaxation time constant @xmath25 .",
    "we see here the decay of the aftershock rate with time .",

    "this produces rearrangements in the values of @xmath8 due to the avalanche dynamics ( eqs .",

    "[ f2](b ) , this relaxation can eventually produce aftershocks at some nearby position .",
    "this means that the number of aftershocks per unit of time are the number of sites at which @xmath8 becomes larger than @xmath29 due to the relaxation .",
    "however , the calculation of this number is difficult because @xmath8 themselves are changed after each aftershock . in order to get a rough estimation",
    ", we consider a typical distribution @xmath30 of the forces after some initial shock , and consider its evolution through relaxation , disregarding the changes of @xmath8 when aftershocks actually occur . assuming that the possible values of @xmath29 are uniformly distributed , the probability to trigger an aftershock at site @xmath7 , will be proportional to the increase of @xmath8 above all previous values it has taken before .",
    "then , defining @xmath31 as the maximum value of @xmath8 for all times smaller than @xmath32 ( namely @xmath33 ) we will estimate @xmath34 the effect of aftershock interaction , that we neglected in this estimation will be reconsidered later on . by",

    "the existence of aftershocks depends crucially on this assumption , and the aftershocks always occur within the region affected by previous shocks in the same cluster . on the other hand , we do not need to assume the validity of the rate - and - state description of the sliding process .",
    "a phenomenology compatible with rate - and - state friction emerges naturally from the microscopic relaxation mechanisms introduced @xcite .",

    "we expect that realistic long range interaction will have an effect in the aftershock rate , as in particular , long range elastic interactions modify the typical roughness of qew interfaces . also , in the presence of long range interactions , a fraction of the aftershocks can nucleate outside the region affected by previous shocks , giving rise to a more realistic situation .",
    "unfortunately , the precise assessment of the effects caused by the consideration of long range elastic interactions in models with viscoelastic relaxation can only be addressed by costly numerical simulations that are out of our present possibilities .",

    "the results are independent of this particular choice .",

    "the location of the new narrow well is obtained by adding to the previous position a quantity @xmath19 , that is exponentially distributed , with mean value @xmath27 .",
    "this generates a random uncorrelated distribution for the location of the wells .",
    "the value of the threshold forces @xmath86 at each pinning center is taken from a gaussian distribution with mean value 1 and standard deviation 1 .",
    "negative values are discarded . as these values are uncorrelated for different pinning centers , each time the interface jumps to a new position , the value of @xmath86 is chosen anew .",
    "the size @xmath89 of an avalanche is defined as the sum of all displacements at every point on the interface , namely @xmath90 , where before and after refer to the values of @xmath6 before the beginning and after the end of the avalanche .    throughout the paper , the value of @xmath83",
