    "despite steady successes in fabrication and measurement techniques , the experimental characterization of multi - qubit systems @xcite remains a challenge due to their complicated level structure .",
    "our goal here is to determine the system s _ parameters _ , as distinct from the more difficult problem of determining its _ state _ , which has to be tackled using quantum state tomography @xcite .",
    "for example , neither the strength nor the sign of the qubit - qubit coupling are known a priori .",
    "one of several standard approaches studies the resonant response of quantum macroscopic systems to an external coherent signal ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , allowing to determine the qubit parameters by scanning the frequency range of the external signal .",
    "the difficulty in the straightforward application of this approach , due to the fact that only few qubits can be actually accessed , and the relation of this problem to the general field of inverse problems , were addressed in @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to the standard spectroscopic methods of characterization would use as a drive a broad - band noise .",
    "we call it _ active noise spectroscopy _ , as distinct from the  passive \" noise spectroscopy of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the response of the noise spectrum to a _ coherent monochromatic _ drive was measured .",
    "recently , we have shown @xcite that classical noise applied to a qubit produces persistent oscillations of the off - diagonal density matrix elements (  coherences \" ) despite finite dephasing and relaxation times .",
    "in other words , a moderate amount of external noise _ enhances _ quantum coherence , which manifests in oscillations with a frequency corresponding to quantum transitions between the ground and first excited states .",
    "there exists an optimal noise amplitude : at lower noise level , oscillations are suppressed , while as the noise is increased , the oscillations become random and the corresponding spectroscopic peak is eventually smeared away . indeed , for zero noise , the oscillations of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix decay on the time scale of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the dephasing rate .",
    "moderate phase - insensitive noise excites the system from time to time , allowing the qubit to evolve with its own frequency between the relatively rare noise spikes , thus , uncovering quantum dynamics .",
    "strong noise produces strong spikes very often , thus leaving no time for the coherent evolution .",
    "this phenomenon is related to both classical and quantum stochastic resonances , which manifest in various physical systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate how these effects of classical noise can help determine the parameters of a multiqubit system .",
    "specifically , we consider two coupled qubits and analyze the spectrum of the density matrix excited by white gaussian classical noise .",
    "we numerically show that the resulting noise spectra contain four peaks , which correspond to the interlevel transitions in the system . from these , the energy spectrum and all the model parameters of the qubits are readily obtained .",
    "in addition , the correlations in the matrix elements corresponding to different qubits can be used to conclude whether the qubits are coupled ferro- or antiferromagnetically .",
    "two coupled qubits can be described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath2 + g \\sigma^1_x\\sigma^2_x      \\label{eq - ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are pauli matrices corresponding to either the first ( @xmath5 ) or the second ( @xmath6 ) qubits , and the eigenstates of @xmath3 are the basis states in the localized representation of the @xmath7th qubit at zero coupling .",
    "note that the results obtained below do not qualitatively depend on the type of coupling ( e.g. , @xmath8 versus @xmath9 ) : in any case the noise will allow to determine the parameters of the two - qubit hamiltonian .",
    "for this reason , and for demonstrating the physical principles of noise - induced spectroscopy , we consider two identical qubits .",
    "the tunneling splitting energies @xmath10 ( in case of the identical qubits we will be investigating here : @xmath11 ) are determined by the design and fabrication details of the device , while the bias energies @xmath12 can be controlled externally and , in our case , are only driven by the noise , @xmath13 the gaussian white noise considered here is zero - averaged and delta - correlated : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the noise intensity , which should be defined for each particular system ( see , e.g. , the example of two flux qubits described below ) .",
    "the uncorrelated noise sources affecting the qubits ( `` local '' noise ) tend to be more detrimental to their quantum coherence than the correlated ones @xcite , which makes eq .",
    "( [ noise ] ) the `` worst case scenario '' .      by writing the qubit density matrix @xmath16 as @xmath17 we can rewrite the master equation @xmath18+\\hat{\\gamma}\\hat{\\rho}\\ ] ] in the form",
    "@xmath19 here we used the standard approximation for the dissipation operator @xmath20 via the dephasing and relaxation rates to characterize the intrinsic noise in the system .",
    "also , hereafter we assume for simplicity that relaxation rates are the same for both identical qubits , i.e. , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and that the temperature is low enough , resulting in the equilibrium values of the diagonal elements of the qubit density matrices being @xmath23 . all the simplifying assumptions ( e.g. , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 etc . )",
    "do not qualitatively affect our results reported below .",
    "for instance , if @xmath27 , the spectrum in fig . 2 will have more peaks , corresponding to larger numbers of levels due to the lifting of the artificial degeneracy .    in the limit of zero coupling @xmath28 , there exists a solution of eqs .",
    "( [ poxy ] ) with no entanglement between qubits .",
    "this solution can be written as a direct product of two single - qubit density matrices written through the corresponding bloch vectors : @xmath29 .",
    "the components of what can be called the bloch tensor @xmath30 are then all zero except for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "if the interaction is not zero , the entanglement between these qubits generates all the components of the bloch tensor to be non - zero @xcite and such an entangled state persists on the time scale @xmath33 after the interaction is later switched off [ @xmath34 .",
    "this reflects the fact that , in the presence of interactions , the eigenstates of the system are entangled @xcite , and the noise terms in the eigenbasis will thus maintain the off - diagonal terms in the density matrix of the two - qubit system .      as a specific example of our approach , which can be experimentally implemented",
    ", we propose to measure two ( almost ) identical superconducting flux qubits consisting of a superconducting loop interrupted by four josephson junctions and coupled via a coupler loop @xcite ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the state of each qubit is controlled by the applied magnetic flux @xmath35 through the loop , where @xmath36 is the flux quantum . in the vicinity of @xmath37 , the ground state of the system",
    "is a symmetric superposition of the states @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with a clock- and counterclockwise circulating superconducting current @xmath40 , respectively . in the basis",
    "@xmath41 the two - qubit system can be described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq - ham ] ) with @xmath42 with classical flux bias fluctuations @xmath43 in the qubit loops around 1/2 , while the tunneling amplitude @xmath44 is determined by the fabrication of the loop and the junctions .",
    "note that the components of the density matrix can be measured _ directly",
    "_ , e.g. , by monitoring the current fluctuations in the flux qubits : @xmath45 .",
    "the direct relation of this spectrum to the current / voltage noise spectrum in the resonant tank @xmath46 circuit coupled to the qubit was used in ref .  .",
    "using the dimensionless time @xmath47 , we numerically solved the system ( [ poxy ] ) by the ito method for two coupled qubits driven only by white classical noise , choosing parameters for damping @xmath48 close to the ones experimentally found in flux qubits .",
    "the spectra of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , for @xmath51 , are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "since this two - qubit system is only driven by noise , the spectrum of both @xmath52 and @xmath53 is enhanced by increasing the noise , and peaks become more distinguished if noise is not too high .",
    "these spectra exhibit four maxima , whose positions nicely agree with the frequencies of the interlevel transitions ( in units of @xmath44 ) : @xmath54 which have values @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "two peaks out of these four frequencies are clearly seen on the @xmath57 spectra in fig .  2 ,",
    "while the other two peaks are better seen on the @xmath58 spectra .",
    "either of these two spectra is sufficient to _ measure both the coupling constant @xmath59 and the tunneling splitting energy @xmath44 _ , while the remaining spectrum can be used for control .",
    "note here that , unlike the single - qubit case @xcite , there are peaks on both @xmath57 and @xmath58 even for small values of the coupling strength @xmath59 , which illustrates our earlier remark on the entangled nature of the eigenstates revealed by classical noise .    to determine whether the coupling is  ferro- \" or ",
    "antiferromagnetic \" , that is , the sign of the coupling constant @xmath59 , we study the time correlations in the density matrix elements @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for @xmath62 and @xmath63 . numerically solving equations ( [ poxy ] )",
    "we obtained the time sequences @xmath64 shown in fig .",
    "3 , where @xmath65 is the discretized time of the simulation . correlations and anticorrelations are clearly seen for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupled qubits , while almost no correlations are seen for the decoupled ones . a qualitative physical picture of these correlations in the time domain",
    "is readily understood .",
    "for instance , for ferromagnetic coupling , the bloch vectors of the two qubits tend to allign for weak enough noise .",
    "a stronger noise excites partially - coherent oscillations in the intervals between two sequential noise spikes , but the qubit - qubit oscillations still tend to preserve the ferromagnetic ordering ( which results in the correlations seen in fig .",
    "3 ) even for the dynamicaly evolving qubits . similarly , the antiferromagnetic coupling tends to produce _",
    "anti_-correlations in the qubit dynamics , as seen in fig .  3 .",
    "to quantitatively describe these correlations we plot the sample pearson correlation coefficient @xmath66 as a function of the coupling constant @xmath59 ( bottom panel of fig .  3 ) . here",
    "@xmath67 is the total number of simulation time steps .",
    "the module of the correlation coefficient @xmath68 exhibits a maximum at @xmath69 . at larger @xmath70",
    "the oscillations become weaker , since the uncorrelated external noises in two qubits suppress each other via their coupling , so that the noise - induced oscillations weaken .",
    "the sign of @xmath68 coincides with the sign of the coupling @xmath59 , which allows to easily distinguish between ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings .",
    "we have demonstrated that quantum correlations in a two - qubit system can be highlighted by the presence of classical noise . as an application of this effect , we suggest the use of noise spectroscopy .",
    "namely , the measurement of the fluctuation spectra of the system , as a means to determine the relevant parameters of the multiqubit system .",
