    "in the merger remnant system ngc  7252 maraston et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found the most luminous star cluster known to date , w3 .",
    "they determined its mass via two independent ways .",
    "first they used the total luminosity of @xmath8 and a stellar @xmath9 derived from a single stellar population model to estimate its mass to be @xmath10  m@xmath2 . as an independent approach they calculated the dynamical mass by measuring the velocity dispersion , which turned out to be quite high , @xmath11  kms@xmath5 , and the effective radius of w3 @xmath12  pc .",
    "this translates to a mass of w3 of @xmath13  m@xmath2 assuming dynamical equilibrium of a spherical object with isotropic velocity distribution .",
    "the age of this object is about @xmath14@xmath15  myr ( maraston et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) , which indicates that it probably formed during the merger event of the host system .",
    "the projected distance of w3 to the centre of ngc  7252 is about @xmath16  kpc and w3 appears to lie within the optical radius of the galaxy .",
    "the size and mass of this object leads to the suggestion that it may be one of the recently discovered ultra compact dwarf galaxies ( ucd ) found in the fornax cluster ( hilker et al .",
    "1999 ; phillipps et al .",
    "2000 ) , rather than an ordinary globular cluster .",
    "the ucd galaxies have been suggested to be the cores of stripped nucleated dwarf galaxies ( bekki et al .",
    "2003 , mieske et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we propose instead a formation scenario which is closely related to the massive star - bursts caused by the interaction of two gas - rich disc galaxies . in interacting systems like the antennae ( ngc  4038/39 ; whitmore et al .  1999 ,",
    "zhang & fall 1999 ) regions of very intense star - formation arise as a result of the tightly compressed interstellar media .",
    "dozens and up to hundreds of young massive star clusters are observed to form in star cluster complexes ( or _ super - clusters _ ) spanning up to a few hundred pc in diameter .",
    "kroupa ( 1998 ) argues that these super - clusters have to be bound objects because their age ( @xmath17  myr ) indicates that they should be already dispersed . simulating super - clusters , by means of stellar dynamical @xmath18-body simulations , fellhauer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that the star clusters within these super - clusters merge on very short time - scales ( a few dozens to a few hundred myr ) , namely a few crossing - times of the super - cluster .",
    "the age - estimate of w3 points to the possibility that it may have formed during the merger event of the host - galaxy ( i.e.  out of merging star clusters ) rather than it being the stripped core of a dwarf galaxy , which should be very old .",
    "in this project we perform stellar dynamical n - body simulations to show that the merging of star clusters in dense star cluster complexes is able to form massive objects like w3 in ngc  7252 .",
    "the simulations are carried out with the particle - mesh code superbox with high - resolution sub - grids which stay focussed on the simulated objects ( fellhauer et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in our models the super - cluster",
    "is initially represented by a plummer sphere with a plummer radius of @xmath19  pc and a cut - off radius of @xmath15  pc .",
    "the clusters inside this super - cluster have a total mass of @xmath20  m@xmath2 , which leads to a crossing time of the super - cluster of @xmath21  myr . inside the plummer sphere of the super - cluster ,",
    "the particles have positions and velocities according to the plummer distribution function .",
    "the particles themselves are plummer spheres representing the star clusters with , respectively , plummer radii of @xmath22 or @xmath16  pc , masses of @xmath23 and @xmath24  m@xmath2 and crossing times of @xmath25 and @xmath26  myr , being represented by @xmath27 and @xmath28  particles . altogether the super - cluster is filled with @xmath29 star clusters , from which @xmath30 are light ones and @xmath31 are of the heavy type to mimic a mass spectrum similar to the one found in the young massive star clusters in the antennae ( zhang & fall 1999 ) .    this super - cluster",
    "is now placed into an analytical galactic potential consisting of a logarithmic potential for the underlying halo , a plummer - kuzmin disc and a hernquist bulge , which add up to an almost flat rotation curve of @xmath32  kms@xmath5 .",
    "the super - cluster is placed at a distance of @xmath33  kpc initially ( apogalacticon ) on an eccentric orbit with perigalacticon of @xmath16  kpc .",
    "= 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm    in contrast to our previous models ( fellhauer & kroupa 2002a , b ) where the merger objects were smaller and not that heavy , the merging process here takes more time . after the first clusters have merged and build up a massive and extended object with the remaining clusters within , it is not encounters between clusters and the merger object which govern the merging process ( the clusters are already within the object ) but dynamical friction acting on the remaining clusters .",
    "nevertheless a massive merger object is present from an early stage on .",
    "the top row of figure  [ fig : t300 ] shows the contour plot of the merger object ( left at @xmath34 and right at @xmath35  myr comprising the suggested age - range of w3 ) .",
    "the contours are spaced in magnitude intervals and masses are converted to luminosities taking a mass - to - light ratio of 0.15 . according to a single stellar population model run with starburst99 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) a stellar population of this age has a @xmath36@xmath37 . in our model these two time - slices mark the transition between the time , when still many star clusters are visible as separate entities and the time when most of the star clusters have already merged or are dissolved within the merger object .",
    "another interesting feature of our model is that the merger object shows a cuspy structure with a dynamically cold core .",
    "the surface - density profile can be fitted by either two king profiles or two exponentials ( fig .  [",
    "fig : t300 ] , middle row ) and the velocity dispersion is rising in the innermost part and reaches its maximum beyond the transition between the core and the envelope ( fig .  [",
    "fig : t300 ] , bottom row ) .",
    "the outer part of the velocity dispersion , reaching from the maximum value to the tidal radius , can be fitted with an exponential profile with an exponential scale length of the order of the tidal radius of the object . beyond the tidal radius the velocity dispersion is rising again due to the large velocities of the extra tidal stars .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] we show the evolution of the total mass , of the effective radius and of the velocity dispersion of our model , whose dynamical evolution was followed for @xmath38  gyr . shown in the right panel of the figure",
    "are the central values of the dynamically cold core as well as the maximum values of the velocity dispersion .",
    "the boxes show the values measured for w3 .",
    "the total mass as well as the maximum velocity dispersion of our model is in reasonable agreement with the data of w3 .",
    "only the effective radius of our model is too small compared with w3 .",
    "it starts off at a value of about @xmath16  pc and it increases slightly until the majority of the star clusters have merged , deforming the core progressively .",
    "after the merging process has ceased the core of the merger object stabilises and the effective radius drops to about @xmath38  pc . but note the extremely large value at @xmath39  myr . at exactly that time a late merger event of one of the remaining star clusters happened .",
    "if our formation scenario is correct then this points to the possibility that we might be observing w3 at the time when a star cluster merges with the core of the object mimicking a large effective radius .",
    "= 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm    the further dynamical evolution is mainly governed by the tidal shaping of the object due to its eccentric orbit .",
    "it leads to a successive mass loss and an increase in the effective radius as well as a decrease in the maximum velocity dispersion , while the central value increases slightly .",
    "looking at the merger object after @xmath38  gyr of its dynamical evolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t300 ] ) shows that this object is very stable against tidal disruption .",
    "also the dynamically cold core is not a transient feature but survives the evolution .",
    "the total mass of the object is still of the order of @xmath40  m@xmath2 which is an order of magnitude more than the most massive globular cluster ( @xmath41  cen ) of the milky way .",
    "the relaxation time - scale of this object , adopting the formula from spitzer & hart ( 1971 ) , is @xmath42  gyr .",
    "this shows that this object might to be thought of as a dwarf galaxy rather than a globular cluster , since @xmath43 is much longer than a hubble time .",
    "with our numerical model we introduce a formation scenario for the ultra - massive star cluster w3 found in ngc  7252 . we propose that this object may not have formed as one star cluster , but rather as a star cluster complex .",
    "the star clusters in this complex have merged and formed w3 .",
    "these star cluster complexes ( super - clusters ) are a common feature in interacting late - type galaxies .",
    "we predict how w3 should look like if it would be possible to resolve it .",
    "its age places it at about the transition time between having many remaining star clusters visible inside and the time when all star clusters have already merged .",
    "one should see the last surviving star clusters in the stage of merging .",
    "furthermore a merger object as massive as w3 should show a distinct core ",
    "envelope structure .",
    "the merger object in our calculation had a dense , dynamically cold core and an extended envelope .",
    "this core ",
    "envelope structure is not a transient feature but a stable configuration .",
    "we followed the evolution of our merger object for @xmath38  gyr and this structure remained .",
    "the core is formed out of the merged star clusters .",
    "the envelope consists out of the stripped stars , lost by the star clusters during the initial violent merger process . in our previous models the merger objects are not massive enough to keep stripped stars bound and they are lost . in the case of the w3 model",
    "the core object is massive enough to retain the stripped stars bound , forming the envelope structure of our model .",
    "w3 is said to be one of the newly discovered ultra - compact dwarf ( ucd ) galaxies and also one of the most massive ones ( maraston et al.2004 ) .",
    "other ucds are found and studied around the central galaxy in the fornax cluster ( ngc  1399 ) by hilker et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , phillipps et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and mieske et al .",
    "there these objects are quite old .",
    "there are two competing formation scenarios for ucds . while bekki et al .",
    "( 2003 ) propose that these objects are the remaining cores of stripped nucleated dwarf galaxies , fellhauer & kroupa ( 2002a ) proposed the merging scenario from star cluster complexes as a possible formation process , resulting naturally from the merging of gas - rich galaxies in groups as the groups merge with a galaxy cluster .",
    "a possible way to distinguish between the two scenarios would be an analysis of the stellar populations in these objects .",
    "while the merging star cluster scenario implies that the stars of the ucds have more or less the same metallicity and age ( this holds at least for the most prominent population formed in the starburst ) , cores of dwarf galaxies should show a more complex metallicity and age distribution . and",
    "as dwarf galaxies are believed to be the oldest building blocks in the universe , the cores should show a prominent very old population .    in the case of",
    "w3 the stripping scenario can be completely ruled out .",
    "age estimates of this object range from @xmath14 to @xmath15  myr , which is also the age of the interaction ( ngc  7252 is a merger remnant of two gas - rich disc galaxies ) .",
    "this time is much too short for a nucleus to be stripped of its surrounding dwarf galaxy .",
    "if this implies that all ucds must have formed in the same way or if both scenarios are possible and are realized by nature can not yet be asserted ."
