    "quantum entanglement is certainly one of the most fascinating concepts arising in quantum mechanics , essentially because it appears as a contradiction to reductionism , _",
    "i.e. _ , the principle by which understanding a complex system reduces to the description of each of its individual constituents @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", a quantum composite system can possibly be in a state such that its parts are more disordered  have a higher entropy  than the whole system .",
    "this peculiar property , known as the non - monotonicity of the von neumann entropy @xcite , is tightly linked to the notion of _ bipartite entanglement_. a pure bipartite entangled state , for example , admits a zero entropy , which translates the fact that one has complete knowledge about the joint system via its wavefunction .",
    "its two parts , however , are mixed , so that they exhibit a nonzero entropy .",
    "in other words , one knows less about the parts than about the system taken as a whole , a property which can not be conceived in classical terms .",
    "the essence of bipartite entanglement is thus that the information about a quantum bipartite system is not only encoded in its parts , but also in the correlations between them .",
    "remarkably , when a bipartite quantum system is _ maximally entangled _ , the information appears to be fully encoded in these correlations and no longer in the system s constituents .",
    "mathematically speaking , while the whole system is described as a pure state , its parts are individually described as maximally mixed states ( with a density matrix proportional to the identity ) .",
    "a paradigmatic example of such a situation is the einstein - poldolsky - rosen ( epr ) state of two qubits @xcite , which is a pure bipartite state whose parts are maximally mixed : each qubit has an entropy of 1 bit , so its state is completely unknown , while the 2-qubit joint state is perfectly determined .",
    "equivalently , one observes that the entropy of one part conditionally on the other is negative ( it is @xmath9 bit ) , which is a sufficient condition for bipartite entanglement and can be associated with a flow of ( virtual ) information backwards in time @xcite .",
    "a very intriguing question is of course whether similar situations may exist if the system is made out of more than two parts .",
    "the underlying concept of _ multipartite entanglement _ becomes naturally much richer than bipartite entanglement , but also generally much more difficult to understand ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review on entanglement ) .",
    "it leads to stronger contradictions with local realism than bipartite entanglement@xcite , as well as to the existence of several inequivalent classes of entangled states even in the simplest case of three qubits @xcite .",
    "multipartite entanglement is also crucial to applications , such as one - way quantum computing @xcite , and its dynamics when exposed to a dissipative environment has revealed a surprisingly large variety of flavors @xcite .    among the possible approaches to multipartite entanglement ,",
    "one of them consists of probing the presence of bipartite entanglement over all inequivalent _ bipartitions _ of all sizes @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", the idea is to measure how much each subset of @xmath1 out of @xmath0 constituents ( with @xmath10 ) can be bipartite entangled with its @xmath2 complementary constituents , knowing that there is a subtle balance with the bipartite entanglement exhibited by all other possible subsets with respect to their complements .",
    "this leads to the concept of a _ genuine _ multipartite entangled state , that is , a @xmath0-partite pure state such that none of its @xmath1-partite subsets can be represented by a pure state ( all subsets are mixed , hence bipartite entangled with their complements ) .",
    "one may even be more specific and seek for a _ strong form _ of a genuine multipartite entangled state .",
    "this would be a composite system in a pure state such that all of its individual constituents are _ maximally _ mixed , all pairs of its constituents are _ maximally _ mixed , all triplets of its constituents are _ maximally _ mixed , and so on up to all @xmath1-tuples of its constituents .",
    "this property , namely the fact of admitting _ maximally mixed reductions _ , is an ideal case of genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "we expect that the constraint of having an overall pure state will set a limit on the possibility of having maximally mixed @xmath1-tuples for large @xmath1 .",
    "consider , for example , a system of @xmath0 qubits in an overall pure state .",
    "it is tempting to search for @xmath0-qubit pure states having the property that all subsets of @xmath1 qubits are maximally mixed up to size @xmath11 .",
    "it has long been known , however , that except for a very few low - dimensional cases , such as the epr state for @xmath12 , it is impossible to find a @xmath0-qubit pure state exhibiting this strong form of genuine multipartite entanglement @xcite .    in this paper , we examine this fundamental question and investigate multipartite entanglement under two perspectives .",
    "first , we focus on the possible existence of @xmath0-qubit states that satisfy this property of admitting maximally - mixed @xmath1-partite reductions for arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we give examples of known states exhibiting this property , then provide a set of conditions that such states must satisfy as well as asymptotic existence bounds .",
    "the second part is centered on a weaker version of this maximally - mixed reduction property , which is motivated by recent results on _ symmetric states _ , a special class of states that are known to exhibit a high multipartite entanglement as measured in terms of their geometric entanglement @xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we expose the representation of @xmath0-qubit pure states in terms of a generalized bloch vector , which is very convenient in order to express the conditions that all @xmath1-partite reductions are maximally mixed .",
    "this leads us to consider , in sec .",
    "iii , a class of @xmath0-partite pure states that we name  balanced \" . in the bloch representation , they correspond to a bloch vector with all components equal to a same value for indices belonging to some subset of the pauli group ( the other components being all taken equal to zero ) .",
    "this makes a connection with the theory of quantum error correction , from which we obtain lower and upper bounds on the highest allowed value of @xmath1 for a given value of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we show that there exist @xmath0-qubit states admitting all maximally - mixed @xmath1-partite reductions with at least @xmath6 when @xmath7 .    in section iv",
    ", we then consider another natural class of states , namely symmetric states , among which it is known that some states with genuine multipartite entanglement can be found .",
    "we prove that , surprisingly , the symmetric states can not have maximally - mixed reductions of size @xmath1 that exceed 1 , regardless of @xmath0 . in that sense",
    ", they are very far from the _ strong _ form of genuine multipartite entanglement that we seek . on the other hand",
    ", we show that the permutation symmetry underlying symmetric states only puts constraints on the components of the bloch vector with an even index , so that the components with an odd index may possibly be taken equal to zero .",
    "this brings us to investigate @xmath0-partite symmetric pure states whose bloch vector has many vanishing odd - index components .",
    "this investigation is carried out numerically , focusing on some symmetric states that maximize geometric entanglement as found in @xcite .",
    "we show that some of these states are close to having maximally - mixed @xmath1-partite reductions for large values of @xmath1 ( although , strictly speaking , @xmath13 ) , so that they approach the _ strong form _ of genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn in sec . v.",
    "the property of admitting maximally - mixed reductions is encapsulated by the following definition :    an @xmath0-qubit pure state @xmath14 is a @xmath1-mm state if all its reductions of size @xmath1 are maximally mixed .",
    "here and in what follows , mm stands for maximally mixed .    note",
    "that according to the definition , a @xmath1-mm state is also a @xmath15-mm state for @xmath16 , and , in particular , every pure state is a @xmath17-mm state .",
    "a natural question which arises here is whether a @xmath1-mm state exists for a given couple @xmath18 .",
    "note that no more than half of the qubits can be in a maximal mixed state , as a consequence of the hilbert - schmidt decomposition of the overall pure state .",
    "so , it is clear that @xmath1-mm states can not exist when @xmath19 . here , we list the known facts about the existence of @xmath1-mm states for small values of @xmath0 :      * for @xmath12 , it is easy to check that the four bell states @xmath20 are 1-mm states . * for @xmath21 , the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz",
    ") state is a 1-mm state , while w state @xcite is not . in general , for any size @xmath0 , the generalized ghz state @xmath22 is a 1-mm state . * for @xmath23",
    ", there exists no 2-mm state . to see this ,",
    "consider the following 4-qubit states : @xmath24 all of their 1-qubit reductions are maximally mixed , so they are 1-mm state , but this is not true for their 2-qubit reductions .",
    "@xmath25 was introduced in @xcite and conjectured to be the 4-qubit maximally entangled state .",
    "then , it was shown to be a local maximum of the averaged 2-qubit von neumann entropy in @xcite .",
    "finally , in @xcite , it was shown that the global maximum for all averaged 2-qubit tsallis and rnyi entropies is reached by @xmath25 for @xmath26 , and by the states @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that no 4-qubit state can have all of its 2-qubit reductions maximally mixed , so indeed no 2-mm state of 4 qubits exists . * for @xmath29 ,",
    "the two logical states @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the 5-qubit code introduced in @xcite are both 2-mm state .",
    "it is easy to check that every qubits ( or every pair of qubits ) is found in a maximally - mixed state after tracing over the remaining qubits . * for @xmath32 , the four 6-qubit states constructed as logical bell state using the previous 5-qubit code states",
    ", @xmath33 are 3-mm states . * for @xmath34",
    ", it is shown in @xcite that no state can have all of its @xmath35 reduction maximally mixed .",
    "note that the case @xmath36 is not solved yet .",
    "we see that the 2-qubit 1-mm state and 6-qubit 3-mm state appear to be very special cases , with maximally mixed reductions up to precisely half the number of qubits ( the trivial upper bound on @xmath1 set by the hilbert - schmidt decomposition ) .",
    "in general , for an arbitrary number @xmath0 of qubits , we can expect that it will be possible to find a @xmath1-mm state up to some threshold value @xmath37 , which only depends on @xmath0 .      to analyze this question",
    ", we need first to introduce the generalized pauli matrices , which are the set of matrices constructed in terms of all @xmath0-fold tensor products of the form @xmath38 where each @xmath39 represents respectively the @xmath40 identity matrix or one of the usual pauli matrices , depending on the index @xmath41 .",
    "the bold index @xmath42 refers to a vector index containing the @xmath0 indices @xmath43 .",
    "there exist @xmath44 such matrices , all being traceless except for @xmath45 which corresponds to the @xmath46 identity matrix and admits a trace @xmath47 . using this set of generalized pauli matrices @xmath48",
    ", it is also possible to construct the bigger set of the form @xmath49 .",
    "this set of @xmath50 elements becomes closed under matrix multiplication and forms the so - called pauli group @xmath3 .",
    "the set @xmath48 also forms a basis of a complex schmidt - hilbert space of dimension @xmath44 , so that every complex square @xmath51 matrix can be seen as a vector @xmath52 in this space .",
    "for instance , a matrix @xmath53 reads @xmath54 while the components @xmath55 are given by the inverse formula @xmath56 which , for a pure state , becomes simply @xmath57 if @xmath53 is a quantum state , then hermiticity ( @xmath58 ) , positivity ( @xmath59 ) , and normalization ( @xmath60 ) give the three following constraints on the components @xmath55 @xcite :    @xmath61    these three relations mean that , after translation by @xmath62 in the zeroth direction , a quantum state is completely represented by the vector @xmath52 , which lives in the positive cone contained in a real subspace of a schmidt - hilbert space , the so - called _ generalized bloch vector _ of dimension @xmath63 .",
    "note that the concept of a positive cone embraces the idea that every convex combination of positive operators is also a positive operator .",
    "pure states , _",
    "i.e. _ , rank - one projectors that satisfy @xmath64 , appear in this representation as vectors @xmath52 that are constrained by @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the structure constants of @xmath67 defined as @xmath68 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "also automatically implies positivity .",
    "it can be decomposed in two independent relations     ( ) _ i_jkg_i(jk)r_jr_k = r_i,[orientation ]    where latin indices correspond to vector indices excluding the zeroth component ( @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 is by definition the generalization of the cross product , and parentheses stand for symmetrization , @xmath71 .",
    "relations and express respectively that for a state being pure , its bloch vector @xmath52 should live on a sphere of radius @xmath72 ( which is actually the boundary of the positive cone ) and should have a specific orientation . for more details on the generalized bloch representation , see @xcite .",
    "the generalized bloch representation is a very useful tool in order to address the maximally - mixed reduction property .",
    "let @xmath53 be the density matrix of an @xmath0-qubit pure state @xmath14 living in the tensor product space @xmath73 , and consider the bipartition @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are defined as the sets of the first @xmath1 qubits and last @xmath2 qubits , respectively . in the generalized bloch representation ,",
    "the @xmath1-qubit reduced density matrix @xmath77 resulting from tracing out the qubits of b is given by @xmath78 where the index @xmath42 has been decomposed according to the bipartion @xmath79 . by using the fact that the matrices @xmath80 are all traceless excepted for the one corresponding to the identity on @xmath81 , noted @xmath82 , we get @xmath83 where @xmath84 with @xmath2 zeros in the vector index at the positions corresponding to @xmath76 .",
    "if we now consider an arbitrary bipartition @xmath85 , we obtain an expression similar to where in the vector index of @xmath86 , the zeros are located at the positions of the traced out qubits .",
    "for instance , for a 6-qubit state , if the first , third , and last qubits are traced out , the component @xmath86 corresponds to @xmath87 .",
    "equation gives a very nice operational procedure for performing the partial trace .",
    "usually , when expressing the density matrix in the computational basis , the entropy resulting from tracing out a part of the system manifests itself both as a loss of some components and as the mixing of some other components of the original density matrix . in the generalized bloch representation , the partial trace appears just as the loss of some components ( see fig .  [ trace ] ) .",
    "for instance , with the bloch representation , the linear entropy of the reduced state simply reads @xmath88    our concern now is the special case where all reduced density matrices @xmath89 for a given size @xmath90 are proportional to the identity on @xmath91 , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the original state is a @xmath1-mm state .",
    "in view of eq .  , this is the case if all components @xmath92 with a vector index @xmath42 containing at least @xmath2 zeros vanish , except for the @xmath93 component which is always equal to @xmath94 . by enumerating all these indices",
    ", we see that there are @xmath95 such components that must vanish .",
    "let us define the _ weight _ @xmath96 of an index @xmath42 ( or by extension of a component @xmath55 or of a generalized pauli matrix @xmath97 ) by its number of non - zero subindices .",
    "then , we can establish the following proposition :    [ propkmm ] the @xmath0-qubit state @xmath53 is a @xmath1-mm state if and only if its corresponding bloch vectors @xmath52 does not have any component @xmath98 with an index weight in the range @xmath99 .",
    "this means that the vector @xmath52 ( after translation by @xmath62 in the zeroth direction ) does not have any non - zero component in the subspace spanned by the basis vectors @xmath97 with index weight lower than or equal to @xmath1 .",
    "if denote this subspace @xmath100 ( of dimension @xmath101 ) and @xmath102 its orthogonal - complementary subspace , we can establish the equivalent proposition :    propkmm the @xmath0-qubit state @xmath53 is a @xmath1-mm state if and only if its corresponding bloch vectors @xmath52 has zero components in @xmath100 , so that its support belongs to @xmath102 .    the existence of a @xmath1-mm state results from the compatibility between having a pure state satisfying eq .   and prop .",
    "[ propkmm ] at the same time .",
    "such a compatibility is not easy to study for an arbitrary couple ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) without more information about the state .",
    "for this reason , we focus in the next section on a class of balanced states that is suitable for analyzing this question and obtaining existence bounds .",
    "in the bloch representation , constructing a pure state directly in terms of the components of its bloch vector involves the orientation relation , which is difficult to manipulate in general . even checking the purity of a given state numerically implies @xmath103 operations , and beyond 10 qubits",
    "the computation time becomes unreasonable on a standard desktop computer .",
    "instead , we will focus on a restricted class of states , which we call _ balanced states_.      balanced state are defined in the bloch representation as states whose non - zero components @xmath55 have all the same value , namely the same value as the identity component @xmath93 .    a @xmath0-qubit balanced state is expressed as @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a subset of the pauli group @xmath3 , which entirely defines the state .",
    "note that in this definition , the hermiticity of @xmath106 implies that @xmath105 does not contain _ complex _ elements of the pauli group of the form @xmath107 .",
    "we can now express the following theorem about the purity of such balanced states :    [ theo - balanced ] the @xmath0-qubit balanced state @xmath106 defined from the set @xmath105 is pure if and only if @xmath105 forms a group under matrix multiplication that is isomorphic to @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath106 is a pure state ( @xmath108 ) then we have @xmath109 the uniqueness of the expansion implies that is satisfied only when @xmath105 is closed under matrix multiplication , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath105 is a subgroup of @xmath3 .",
    "it follows that @xmath110 which implies that for @xmath106 being pure , the order of @xmath105 should be @xmath111 . in summary",
    ", @xmath105 must fulfill the three following properties :    * @xmath105 has a finite order equal to @xmath111 ; * @xmath105 is abelian because normalization and hermiticity of @xmath106 imply @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively ; * all the elements of @xmath105 have order 2 , _",
    "i.e. _ , they are such that @xmath114 , since @xmath113 .    according to the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups",
    "@xcite , this implies that @xmath115 .",
    "a simple example of such a pure balanced state is the state @xmath116 .",
    "its components in the bloch representation are given by eq .",
    "as @xmath117 which are non - zero if and only if @xmath97 is a tensor product of identity and @xmath118 matrices .",
    "there are @xmath111 such matrices @xmath97 , which form the set @xmath105 , and thus the state can be written explicitly as @xmath119 where it is clear that @xmath120 just by relabelling the identity matrix @xmath121 as `` 0 '' and the pauli matrix @xmath122 as `` 1 '' , for instance @xmath123 .",
    "according to prop .  1",
    ", a pure balanced state will be a @xmath1-mm state if its group @xmath105 does not contain elements with an index weight lower than or equal to @xmath1 ( except for weight zero ) .",
    "this problem is fully equivalent to finding an additive self - orthogonal quantum error - correcting code over gf(4 ) @xcite .",
    "more generally , the connection between entanglement and quantum error correcting codes ( qecc ) was noted by several authors , and it was proven for example in @xcite that a qecc that can detect @xmath1 errors is also a @xmath1-mm state .",
    "the reciprocal of this statement can easily be understood by interpreting each pauli matrix as an error operation . indeed , for every tensor product of pauli matrices with index weight @xmath99 , eq .",
    "gives @xmath124 for a @xmath1-mm state @xmath14 , which means that each error @xmath97 is detectable because it rotates the state in an orthogonal subspace .      by exploiting this relationship ,",
    "known bounds in the context of qecc can be mapped onto existence bounds for @xmath1-mm states .",
    "the quantum gilbert - varshamov ( gv ) and quantum hamming ( h ) bounds introduced in @xcite give , respectively , lower and upper bounds on the number of errors that a quantum code can detect , for a given number of qubits .",
    "they can be directly translated in our context and give @xmath125 in terms of the subspace dimension @xmath101 .",
    "asymptotically , these bounds can be written as @xcite @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a decreasing function which has a root in @xmath128 .",
    "physically , this means that it is always possible to find a @xmath0-qubit @xmath1-mm state ( @xmath129 ) that is such that , by keeping less than 19% or more than 81% of its qubits , we completely lose the information on the initial pure state . on the other hand , it is impossible to find such a state if we keep between 38% and 62% of its qubits .",
    "the situation in the region between 19% and 38% ( or between 62% and 81% ) is unknown , see fig .",
    "an intriguing physical implication of these bounds is that the entropy behaves as an extensive quantity ( it is proportional to the number of qubits ) in any subsystem as long as it has a size lower than 19% of the total system .",
    "it is only beyond this bound that , at some point , we observe a defect of extensitivity which originates from the purity of the state of the total system .",
    "note that there exist more accurate bounds on qecc ( see for instance @xcite ) , but these are useless in our case .",
    "indeed , finding a @xmath1-mm state is equivalent to finding a one - codeword s code , and typically these other bounds become stronger only when the number of codewords exceeds 1 . in our case , there are no known better bounds than the quantum hamming and quantum gilbert - varshamov bounds .",
    "constructive upper and lower bounds can also be obtained numerically .",
    "for instance , the search of additive self - orthogonal quantum codes over gf(4 ) based on linear programing has been performed up to around 100 qubits .",
    "such results are plotted in fig .  2 , based on markus grassl s database @xcite .",
    "-mm states based on markus grassl s database @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic limits on the domain of existence are also shown , namely the quantum hamming bound ( thin red line ) and quantum gilbert - varshamov bound ( thin green line).,width=302 ]",
    "in @xcite , it is conjectured that any @xmath0-qubit state of maximal multipartite entanglement should be a @xmath130-mm state , when the entanglement is measured through ( the sum of ) the negativity over all inequivalent bipartitions .",
    "we may naively extend this conjecture by saying that any @xmath0-qubit state of maximal multipartite entanglement should be a @xmath1-mm state , with @xmath1 being the maximum allowed value as analyzed in the previous section . while this is very well possible",
    ", we will see that the _ symmetric states _",
    ", as defined below , are not the good candidates to test this conjecture . to understand why , we first recall that a symmetric state is a @xmath0-qubit pure state that is invariant under any permutations of its qubits , that is @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the unitary transformation that effects the permutation @xmath133 over the set of qubits and @xmath134 is the symmetric group of @xmath0 objects .",
    "these symmetric states form a @xmath135-dimensional symmetric subspace of @xmath136 , which is often considered as a good subspace to look for genuine multipartite entangled states , particularly in terms of their geometric entanglement @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , we observe that they satisfy the following theorem :    [ theo - symmetric ] symmetric @xmath0-qubit states are at most @xmath130-mm states .",
    "we first express the unitary transformation that effects the transposition between qubits @xmath137 and @xmath138 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the _ swap _ operator . in terms of generalized pauli matrices",
    ", this operator reads @xmath139 in this expression we use the more usual notation for generalized pauli matrices , _",
    "i.e. _ the positions of non - identity matrices are indicated as superscripts while the positions of identity matrices are implicit , and the global identity is still written @xmath45 .",
    "for instance , @xmath140 corresponds to the action of @xmath141 on the first and second qubits .",
    "now , we can write its expectation value in a given pure state @xmath14 as @xmath142 because the symmetric group @xmath134 can be generated by the set of all transpositions of two elements , the set of relations is fully equivalent to the set of relations @xmath143,\\label{cont1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which provide conditions on some components of the generalized bloch vector @xmath52 of a symmetric state @xmath14 . at the same time",
    ", a @xmath1-mm state with @xmath8 should have all components @xmath144 with @xmath145 , according to prop .  1 , which necessarily contradicts some of the relations .    note that in the context of qecc , theorem  [ theo - symmetric ] means that it is not possible to find a code in the symmetric subspace detecting more than one error ( or correcting any error ) .",
    "more physically , we see that the permutation symmetry creates some frustration , which prevents the subsets of 2 qubits ( or more ) to be all maximally mixed .",
    "a natural question is of course whether permutation symmetry also manifests itself by constraining _",
    "higher _ index weight terms to be non - zero . to answer this question ,",
    "let us define the concept of _ parity _ of an index @xmath42 ( and by extension of a matrix @xmath146 or of a component @xmath98 ) :    [ even - odd ] let index @xmath42 contain @xmath147 subindices 1 , @xmath148 subindices 2 , and @xmath149 subindices 3 . the parity of @xmath42 is defined as even if the @xmath150 s are all even .",
    "otherwise , it is defined as odd .",
    "for instance the indices @xmath151 and @xmath152 are even , but @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 are odd . note that any component @xmath55 with an odd index weight @xmath96 is necessarily an odd component .",
    "we can now state that    [ theo - pair ] for a symmetric state , the even components @xmath98 of a given index weight @xmath156 can not all vanish .",
    "let us consider the expectation value of @xmath157 transpositions acting on disjoined supports ( @xmath158 ) : @xmath159 where , in this expression , there are @xmath160 terms of the form @xmath161 which correspond to all the combinations of @xmath162 transpositions chosen among the @xmath157 transpositions . by induction , starting from the case @xmath163 corresponding to eq .",
    ", we conclude that all terms labeled by even indices should be equal to one , leading to the constraints @xmath164 for @xmath165 .",
    "thus for symmetric states , _ even _ components @xmath98 of weight @xmath166 can not all vanish .",
    "note that _ a priori _ the odd components are not constrained explicitly by the permutation symmetry . to see this , a reasoning similar to the above proof can be done by considering the expectation values of a 3-cycle acting on qubits @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "we have @xmath170 where @xmath171 stands for the completely antisymmetric symbol . since we must have @xmath172 and since eq .",
    "is satisfied , it follows @xmath173 since @xmath174 is completely symmetric in its lower indices for a symmetric state , eq .",
    "( [ odd ] ) is necessarily satisfied .",
    "then , we can generalize the last procedure by averaging the product of disjoined transpositions and a 3-cycle ( acting on a disjoined support ) .",
    "proceeding by induction in analogy to the reasoning leading to eq .",
    ", we obtain again a set of relations @xmath175 which are necessarily satisfied .",
    "thus , in contrast with the _ even _ components which can not all vanish in a symmetric state , the _ odd _ components are not constrained by permutation symmetry .",
    "it must be stressed that the odd components may , however , be possibly constrained for another reason , in particular as a result of the purity constraint .",
    "it is nevertheless natural to seek for symmetric states such that a large number of their odd components would vanish , which would correspond to high multipartite entanglement . in order to test this possibility",
    ", we now investigate specific states defined in @xcite , known to exhibit high geometric entanglement .      in @xcite ,",
    "some symmetric states with high geometric entanglement have been found . in particular , in @xcite , an optimization procedure was performed up to @xmath176 in order to find the states that maximize their geometric entanglement .",
    "those states are good candidate to test whether odd component @xmath55 indeed vanish .",
    "of course , a direct calculation of these components by using expression in the full @xmath111-dimensional space is not realistic if @xmath0 is not very small .",
    "fortunately , by exploiting permutation symmetry , we obtain the following simplifications enabling an efficient calculation .    the first simplification comes from counting the number of distinct components that we need to calculate for a symmetric state .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath177 implies @xmath178 for any permutation @xmath179 .",
    "thus , it is more convenient to label each component @xmath55 by a 4-component vector @xmath180 $ ] which enumerates the numbers of subindices 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 in the index @xmath42 .",
    "for instance , we have @xmath181}$ ] . for a given @xmath182 ,",
    "the number of equal components @xmath98 corresponding to the same @xmath183 is given by the multinomial coefficient @xmath184 .",
    "thus , instead of having to calculate @xmath44 components , only @xmath185 distinct components are needed , corresponding to the number of distinct multinomial coefficients .",
    "note that permutation symmetry also implies that @xmath186 for any permutations @xmath187 , which leads to other constraints on the components @xmath55 .",
    "the second simplification comes from calculating in the so - called _ dicke basis _ , which is a natural basis of the @xmath135-dimensional symmetric subspace and",
    "allow us to use the states as expressed in this basis in @xcite .",
    "any symmetric state can be decomposed as @xmath188 where @xmath189 are the dicke states , @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "the dicke states are written in the computational basis as @xmath192 where @xmath193 is a binary vector of size @xmath0 such that @xmath194 .",
    "symmetric states can also be defined in terms of the majorana representation @xcite . in this representation , every symmetric state @xmath14",
    "is characterized by a collection of @xmath0 one - qubit states @xmath195 which can be viewed as @xmath0 points in the surface of the bloch sphere , according to the expression @xmath196 for some phase @xmath197 and some normalization factor @xmath198 .",
    "we can move from the majorana representation to the dicke basis thanks to the relation @xcite @xmath199 but this is really inefficient as it involves a sum over all permutations .",
    "instead , we use the fact , also noted in @xcite , that the majorana parameters @xmath200 are the roots of the polynomial @xmath201 thus , knowing the majorana parameters @xmath202 , the dicke components @xmath203 can be calculated in about @xmath204 operations by solving the set of linear equations @xmath205 , with @xmath75 being a matrix of entries @xmath206 .",
    "the last simplification concerns the expression of the generalized pauli matrices themselves .",
    "indeed , in order to compute the components @xmath183 of a symmetric state of known components @xmath203 in the dicke basis , we only need the _ symmetric _ part of the generalized pauli matrices @xmath146 , that is , their projection into the symmetric subspace .",
    "these symmetric matrices are @xmath207 matrices in the dicke basis , which we note as @xmath208 .",
    "just as for the components @xmath98 of a symmetric state , there are @xmath209 generalized pauli matrices @xmath146 which are all projected onto the same symmetric matrix @xmath208 , labeled by the index @xmath182 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath208 in the dicke basis are @xmath210 where we have taken an arbitrary order for the individual pauli matrices in @xmath146 .",
    "then , the vectors @xmath193 and @xmath211 can be cut in four pieces @xmath212 and @xmath213 of size @xmath214 ( @xmath215 $ ] ) . to simplify the notation , we note as @xmath216 the domain satisfying the set of constraints on vectors @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "it follows @xmath217 by using the definition of the usual @xmath40 pauli matrices , we can write each factor as @xmath218 where _ barred _ vectors stand for the complementary vectors , for instance @xmath219 .",
    "these equations can be rewritten in terms of the new indices @xmath220 and @xmath221 as @xmath222 and the sum over each @xmath212 can be replaced by a sum over each @xmath223 weighted by a factor @xmath224 .",
    "eventually , the matrix elements @xmath208 can be reexpressed as @xmath225 where the sum is taken over the four indices @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 which can take values between 0 and @xmath230 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively , with the two constraints @xmath231 note that in the worst case where each @xmath232 , this calculation implies to calculate about @xmath233 terms . as an example for two qubits ( @xmath12 ) , the symmetric part of the generalized pauli matrices @xmath234 and @xmath235 corresponds to @xmath236}=\\left ( \\begin{array}{ccc }   0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } & 0 \\\\   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } & 0 & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\\\   0 & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } & 0 \\end{array } \\right).\\ ] ]    by using explicit expressions of symmetric states with maximum geometric entanglement taken from @xcite or 3d coordinates available in the sloane database @xcite , these simplifications allow us to calculate efficiently the distinct components in the dicke basis as @xmath237 for @xmath23-@xmath238 ( and also for @xmath239 ) , the ratios between the number of zero odd components and the total number of odd components are gathered in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".[table1]proportion of vanishing odd components in symmetric states that maximize geometric entanglement ( from @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xmath240 is not the maximum but only a state really close to it which allows an explicit writing . [ cols=\"^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we observe that a large proportion of odd components vanish for these states . in the special cases @xmath32 and @xmath241 , really all odd components vanish .",
    "for the case @xmath23 and @xmath176 , the states constructed thanks to the 3d coordinates available in @xcite give better results , namely the ratio @xmath242 for @xmath23 and @xmath243 for @xmath176 , even though these states are equivalent to those of @xcite ( _ i.e. _ related by symmetric unitary transformation @xmath244 ) .",
    "this is the case because the proportion of vanishing odd components is _ basis - dependent _ , in the sense that two equivalent symmetric states will have in general a different structure in the vector @xmath183 even if they have the same entanglement content .    finally , we observe that the structure of the vector @xmath183 often takes a particularly simple form , especially for these states with a large proportion of vanishing odd components . for @xmath23 and @xmath32 ,",

    "note that the presence of the minus sign can be see as a consequence of the purity constraint . for @xmath241 and @xmath176 ,",
    "the structure is similar even if a little bit more complex because it involves one or two different values per permutation of the @xmath182 index . in particular , for @xmath176 , the structure is similar to that of @xmath23 or 6 in the sense that we have the non - zero components : @xmath247}\\\\ r_{\\pi[10,2,0,0]}\\\\ r_{\\pi[8,4,0,0]}\\\\ r_{\\pi[8,2,2,0]}\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}=\\frac{1}{2^n } \\begin{pmatrix } 1\\\\ \\pm 1/3\\\\ 2/10\\\\ \\pm 1/15\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}.\\label{r12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we believe that a possible new approach to analyzing maximum entangled states in the symmetric subspace for higher values of @xmath0 should be inspired by these nice structures , and take the vector @xmath183 as a starting point .",
