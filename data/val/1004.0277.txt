    "the mixing of two or more types of polymers is of great scientific and technological interest , as it opens up the possibility of creating new materials emerging with specific physical and chemical properties.@xcite however , although polymer blends have been very much a part of everyday life , these continue to be a source of extensive scientific inquiry . the rich physics in polymer mixtures stems in part from the fact that their structure and dynamics change as thermodynamic conditions that cause phase separation ( i.e.  spinodal decomposition ) are approached .",
    "mixture stability is not only driven by temperature and composition , but also by differences in chain length and monomer architecture that may contribute substantial entropic effects . from physical and engineering standpoints , a goal is to understand and predict changes that a polymer will undergo when mixed with another polymer system @xcite .",
    "theoretical efforts have focused on this area , resulting in the development of several approaches connecting monomeric structure to static and dynamic properties as a function of thermodynamic parameters @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) studies have aided our understanding of the correlation between local ( intra- and intermolecular ) structure and global fluid properties that govern polymer mixtures @xcite .",
    "however , these computational approaches have been limited to relatively small length and time scales because present - day computing power limits the attainment of extended scales.@xcite . for polymer blends , this is particularly problematic because as the spinodal decomposition is approached , a divergent length scale in concentration fluctuations develops , thereby readily exceeding box sizes commonly used to model polymeric ensembles . in this manner",
    ", the determination of large - scale properties for polymer mixtures with atomic resolution requires increasingly larger simulation boxes , and becomes rapidly unfeasable .    one way to circumvent",
    "this difficulty is to introduce a coarse - grained description of the polymer mixture , where small - scale atomistic details are statistically averaged out .",
    "the resulting structure allows for computer simulations of large systems , including a high number of polymers , chains with large molecular weights , and for a long timescale .",
    "recent mesoscopic descriptions based on various coarse - grained approaches have been presented in the literature and effectively utilized to investigate the demixing of polymer solutions@xcite , immiscible polymer blends@xcite , and star - linear polymer mixtures.@xcite by combining information obtained from simulations of the coarse - grained system with information obtained at smaller lengthscales and shorter times , in the context of a multiscale procedure , it is possible to obtain a complete and exhaustive description of the polymer mixture at all lengthscales of interest.@xcite we have previously shown that a procedure , which combines information at the two length scales of the effective segment length and the radius of gyration , accurately determines the structural properties of homopolymer melts.@xcite this multiscale modeling procedure has been recently extended to treat polymer mixtures.@xcite    in this publication , we focus on performing simulations of polymer mixtures where the ensemble of polymers is mapped onto a system of interacting soft , colloidal particles . at this level of coarse - graining",
    "each polymer is represented as one soft colloidal particle centered at the polymer center - of - mass .",
    "the concept of modeling flexible polymer chains as soft spheres was originally proposed by flory and krigbaum@xcite for dilute polymer solutions ; however , the resulting effective potential exhibited an incorrect trend in repulsive interactions with increasing chain length or polymer density .",
    "for dilute to semidilute solutions , louis and co - workers were able to obtain correct scaling behavior for polymer chains mapped onto soft spheres using liquid state theory in conjunction with monte carlo simulations.@xcite this approach was later extended to poor solvent conditions where coils contract to avoid contact with the solvent.@xcite importantly , this work shows that for a given set of state conditions , a simple effective pair potential , @xmath0 , is capable of reproducing the radial distribution function , @xmath1 , which depends on many body interactions . due to this reduction in interactions that need to be calculated at each computational step ,",
    "mesoscale simulations of polymers represented as soft colloids , are useful in determining many structural as well as dynamical properties of polymer blends , including how morphologies develop depending on the thermodynamic parameters of the system@xcite .",
    "the advantage of this extreme coarse - graining of the polymer is that it is possible to simulate very large ensembles of particles , i.e. adopt large simulation boxes , with a modest increase in the computational time .",
    "such an extreme level of coarse - graining becomes important for simulations of systems where the relevant range of length scales is particularly large , for example in micellar aggregates of ionic surfactants.@xcite    the implementation of mesoscale simulations requires attaining the effective `` bare '' potential , @xmath2 , that characterizes pairwise decomposable interactions between molecular center - of - mass ( com ) sites . since @xmath2 corresponds to a free energy obtained from the monomer frame of reference , it depends on the thermodynamic state of the system , as specified by the density , temperature , polymer molecular weight , and composition of the mixture .",
    "the determination of a reliable , fully transferable , coarse - grained potential is a highly desirable goal.@xcite while phenomenological as well as rigorously numerical approaches have been described in the literature @xcite to determine effective coarse - grained pair potentials for polymer systems , their reliance on acquired microscopic simulation data partially defeats the gain in computational time that is possible with a coarse - graining procedure . typically , mesoscopic potentials are optimized to full atomistic simuluations under a given set of thermodynamic conditions , limiting their transferability .",
    "moreover , the optimization procedure generally starts from the mean - force potential , which is the effective potential between two particles _ in the field _ of the surrounding particles , and is conceptually different from the bare potential , @xmath2 .",
    "we have developed an analytical formalism to calculate the effective potential , @xmath2 , starting from liquid state theory and solving the ornstein - zernike equation.@xcite the potential obtained in such a manner is explicitly related to the structural parameters of the polymer , making it specific to any system we desire to simulate , but also fully transferable to systems with different molecular structure and thermodynamic conditions .",
    "more specifically , our non - phenomenological expressions for the com - com total pair intermolecular correlation functions , @xmath3 , between self @xmath4 and cross @xmath5 interactions , are obtained from a generalized ornstein - zernike integral equation for binary polymer mixtures where atomistic sites are accounted for as real sites , while coarse - grained sites are treated as auxiliary sites .",
    "the equation formally bridges information from the microscopic ( monomer ) domain to mesoscopic ( molecular ) scales .",
    "the derived equations for @xmath3 reproduce well and with no fitting parameters united atom ( ua ) molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation data in both real and reciprocal spaces .",
    "our renormalized description,@xcite correctly recovers the known analytical expressions for density and concentration fluctuations of mixtures of colloidal liquids , by kirkwood and buff,@xcite and bhatia and thornton , @xcite slightly modified as our expressions account for soft potentials instead of hard - core ones .",
    "together , these tests provide a benchmark which supports the foundation of our renormalization procedure .    in the current publication",
    "we extend our previous work to demonstrate that the derived coarse - grained effective potential , when input to mesoscale md simulations of binary polymer blends , is capable of reproducing the large scale structure of the polymer , which depends on many body interactions at the monomer level .",
    "we demonstrate that our approach is useful to produce mesoscale simulations of binary homopolymer mixtures at various temperatures and concentrations approaching the spinodal . in this way",
    ", we are able to test the derived potential in terms of how well it reproduces the mesoscopic structure of the mixture over different regions of the phase diagram , where atomistic level simulations are computationally exhaustive .",
    "we make use of the hypernetted - chain ( hnc ) closure to calculate the effective potential , @xmath6 , as a function of the total correlation function , @xmath3 . in turn , the pair potentials , @xmath6 , are used as an input to a coarse - grained simulation , where polymers interact as soft colloidal particles .",
    "systems investigated are blends of polyethylene , polyisobutylene , as well as polypropylenes in their head - to - head , istotactic , as well as syndiotactic forms . we show that our method is robust and allows for the equilibrium structural properties of the fluid mixture to be readily calculated under any thermodynamic parameters of interest .",
    "while the focus here is on static properties , the derived potential is widely applicable to non - equillibrium systems , and may be useful in other methods commonly employed , such as dissipative particle dynamics@xcite , which currently rely on numerical potentials .    to demonstrate the reliability of our mesoscale simulations , we first consider systems which are far from the spinodal temperature , for which the liquid is well - mixed , and",
    "show that in this regime , our @xmath6 reproduces quantitatively the liquid structure at the level of com obtained from ua md simulations@xcite , establishing consistency between the different levels of description .",
    "we then extend our analysis to different thermodynamic conditions for which no ua data is available , focusing on mixtures of head - to - head polypropylene and polyethylene ( hhpp / pe ) in the miscible region of the phase diagram .",
    "the temperature dependence is expressed in terms of a single interaction parameter that enters our simulation through the analytical form of the potential and depends on the local interactions between monomers . from the simulation trajectories ,",
    "we calculate pair distribution functions which depend on the parameters of the system and manifest the trends for demixing of the coarse - grained mixture . from this treatment , and from the fact that our expressions recover known expressions for colloidal liquids , we calculate the concentration fluctuation contribution to the scattering function , @xmath7 , which is related to the scattered light intensity measured in experimental studies of critical binary polymer mixtures . in this way",
    ", we are able to test the derived potential in terms of how well it reproduces the mesoscopic structure of the mixture over different regions of the phase diagram .",
    "results show that the effective potential between center of masses of polymers in a mixture can be used to produce mesoscopic simulations under a variety of thermodynamic conditions , making the procedure useful to a number of application in polymer physics . to test the versatility of our approach",
    "we show how the proposed theory may be applied to blends that present a lower critical solution temperature ( lcst ) .",
    "we study the hhpp / pib mixture using the temperature dependence of the @xmath8 parameter from the literature and run mesoscale simulations at various temperatures .",
    "the concentration fluctuation structure factor shows that fluctuations in concentration become smaller as the temperatures decreases , as it is expected .",
    "the current publication is organized as follows . in section [ sx :",
    "hofr ] , a review of our derivation for @xmath3 is provided .",

    "finally , in section [ sx : lcst ] we show how our approach is effective in predicting high temperature demixing for the lcst blend hhpp / pib .",
    "pair correlation functions ( pcfs ) comprise a standard approach in liquid - state theory to describe the structure of liquids . since it is generally sufficient to account for two - body correlations",
    ", pcfs can be employed to determine all structural and thermodynamic properties of a system @xcite . moreover , these are input to the equation of motion describing cooperative dynamics , where the effect of the surrounding medium on single - chain dynamics is taken into account @xcite . in the context of our coarse - graining procedure , pcfs provide a convenient manner of calculating , with the aid of an appropriate closure , the bare pair potential needed to perform mesoscopic simulations . in this section ,",

    "<S> mesoscopic molecular dynamics simulations are used to determine the large scale structure of several binary polymer mixtures of various chemical architecture , concentration , and thermodynamic conditions . by implementing an analytical formalism , which is based on the solution to the ornstein - zernike equation </S>",
    "<S> , each polymer chain is mapped onto the level of a single soft colloid . from the appropriate closure relation , the effective , soft - core potential between coarse - grained units is obtained and used as input to our mesoscale simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the potential derived in this manner is analytical and explicitly parameter dependent , making it general and transferable to numerous systems of interest . from computer simulations performed under various thermodynamic conditions the structure of the polymer mixture , through pair correlation functions , </S>",
    "<S> is determined over the entire miscible region of the phase diagram . in the athermal regime mesoscale simulations exhibit </S>",
    "<S> quantitative agreement with united atom simulations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , they also provide information at larger scales than can be attained by united atom simulations and in the thermal regime approaching the phase transition . </S>",
