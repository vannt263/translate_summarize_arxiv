    "the problem of self - avoiding walks ( saws ) on lattices provides perhaps the simplest geometrical model of equilibrium critical phenomena ( i.e. , non - trivial power - laws in the behavior of different quantities in a system in thermal equilibrium ) .",
    "the two other familiar examples of geometrical models showing phase transitions , the percolation problem and a system of hard particles ( spheres or rods ) , both involve more complex geometrical structures .",
    "the model of saws captures the important macroscopic features of polymers in solution , and is closely related to other models of phase - transitions in statistical physics like the ising model @xcite , and can also be seen as the @xmath2 limit of the @xmath0-vector model @xcite .",
    "given the many technological applications of polymers , and the importance of saws as a model of critical phenomena , it is not surprizing that the model has attracted a lot of attention in the last sixty years .",
    "several good reviews are available summarizing our current understanding of this problem @xcite .",
    "the saw problem is clearly trivial in one dimension . in spite of the large number of papers related to this problem , an exact solution of the problem has not been possible so far , for any non - trivial case . in two dimensions , the exact value of the growth constant is known for the hexagonal lattice @xcite , and has been conjectured for the square lattice from large - order exact series expansions @xcite .",
    "the exact value of the critical exponents in two dimensions is known from conformal field theory @xcite . even for dimensions",
    "@xmath3 , where the critical exponents are known to take mean - field values @xcite , a full solution has not been possible .    given the paucity of exact solutions in this area , it seems reasonable to look for some artificially constructed graphs , e.g. fractals , for which an exact solution can be found .",
    "this solution then , can be considered as an approximation to the original problem .",
    "the advantage of this approach , over other ad - hoc approximations like the flory approximation , is that one is assured of well - behavior requirements like the convexity of the free energy , and avoids problems like getting two different values for a quantity ( e.g. the pressure for hard - sphere systems ) , if one calculates it in two different ways within the same approximation .",
    "another motivation for the study of saws on fractals comes from the need to understand how the critical exponents depend on the dimension and the topological structure of underlying space . in the formal techniques like @xmath4-expansions ,",
    "one treats the dimension of space @xmath5 as a parameter that can be varied continuously , but such techniques involve a formal analytical continuation of various perturbative field theory integrals of the type @xmath6 to all real values of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , this formal approach does not give any simple answer to the question ,  what is the ising model in 3.99 dimensions ? \" .",
    "on the other hand , fractals are explicitly constructed spaces of non - integer dimension , and one can construct fractals with dimension close to any given real number @xmath5 .",
    "one can thus study how critical exponents change by changing the geometry of the underlying space .",
    "interestingly , the results from the formal @xmath4-expansion techniques do not match with those from explicitly constructed fractals .",
    "the main reason seems to be the assumption of translational invariance in the former , while the explicitly constructed fractals do not have this property .",
    "in fact , this assumption seems to be problematic for spaces with non - integer dimensions , and leads to pathologies such as non - positive measure @xcite . for a longer discussion of these issues , see @xcite .",
    "a third reason for the study of saws on fractals is that these provide excellent pedagogical examples of application of renormalization group techniques to the determination of critical exponents .",
    "if one tries to implement the renormalization transformation to some system like the ising model in two dimensions , one eventually generates an infinity of additional multi - spin or longer range couplings , which are presumably irrelevant , and are neglected to get renormalization equations in terms of a finite number of variables .",
    "the justification given for doing this usually involves too much ` handwaving ' for a discerning student . in case of fractals ,",
    "one gets exact renormalization equations in terms of a finite number of coupling constants .",
    "one can then study these in detail , and explicitly work out their trivial and non - trivial fixed points , stable and unstable directions , basins of attractions of fixed points , critical exponents in terms of eigenvalues of the linearized transformation etc .",
    ", and learn the use of renormalization group techniques for determining critical properties .",
    "finally , one can treat the fractal lattice as a simple model for a disordered substrate on which the polymer is adsorbed , and use the exact results found for polymers on fractals to develop some understanding about real experimental systems .",
    "but for this , this article would not have been included in this volume .",
    "the simplest of graphs for which the saw problem is analytically tractable is the bethe lattice , for which the exact solution is trivial , as the graph has no loops .",
    "only slightly more complicated is the case of husimi cactus graphs , which are like the bethe lattice on the large scale , but have small loops [ fig .",
    "[ husimi ] ] .",
    "these do change some properties like the connectivity constant for the walks , but the large - scale properties of walks on such lattices are the same as on the bethe lattice . in this chapter , we will discuss fractal graphs which have loops of arbitrarily large size , and for which the critical exponents are different from the mean - field values .    .",
    "( b ) a husimi cactus made up of triangles . , width=377 ]    this chapter is organized as follows : in section 2 , we start with the precise definitions of the fractals we study .",
    "we also define the saw generating functions , their annealed and quenched averages and the critical exponents of self - avoiding walks . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the renormalization group treatment of the saws on the 3-simplex lattice in detail .",
    "we explicitly construct the recursion equations , and show how the critical exponents of saws can be determined from an analysis of the linearized renormalization group transformation near the fixed point .",
    "the dense phase of the polymer , and the fluctuations of the number of rooted walks are also discussed briefly . in section 4 ,",
    "we show how this treatment is generalized to other fractals where one has more complicated recursion equations than the simplest case of @xmath7-simplex lattice .. we also discuss the behavior of critical exponents on the @xmath0-simplex in the limit of large @xmath0 . in section 5",
    ", we discuss the saws on the given - mandelbrot family of fractals , and study the behavior of critical exponents of walks when the fractal dimension of the lattice tends to 2 from below .",
    "we use finite - size scaling theory to determine how the structure of the renormalization equations depends on the parameter @xmath8 defining the fractals .",
    "we develop a perturbative expansion for the critical exponents valid for large @xmath8 when the fractal dimension of the lattice is just below @xmath1 . in section 6",
    ", we discuss the collapse transition of linear polymers with attractive self - interaction , and the tricritical @xmath9-point .",
    "we also discuss other intermediate ` semi - compact ' phases that is seen on some fractals . in section 7 , we show that much of our treatment of linear polymers can be extended to branched polymers .",
    "one can determine the critical exponents @xmath9 for average number of branched polymer configurations per site , and @xmath10 for the mean polymer size using the rsrg techniques .",
    "interestingly , one finds that for @xmath11 fractals with @xmath12 , the average number of branched polymers per site increases as @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , and the leading form of correction to the exponential growth is not a power - law correction .",
    "this stretched exponential form arises from the presence of favorable and unfavorable regions on the fractal lattice . in section 8",
    ", we discuss a polymer with self - attraction near an attractive surface . in this case",
    ", there is a competition between the collapse transition in the bulk of the fractal , and the tendency of the polymer to stick to the surface .",
    "we discuss the qualitative features of the phase - diagram , and critical exponents .",
    "the phase - diagram is somewhat complicated when the next layer interaction is included , and provides a good pedagogical example for the study of higher order multi - critical points .",
    "one can study even more complicated systems .",
    "section 9 contains a discussion of two mutually interacting linear chains , as a model of the zipping -unzipping transition in the double - stranded dna molecules .",
    "section 10 contains some concluding remarks , and we mention some open problems which deserve further study .",

    "we note that the collapse transition on fractal lattices corresponds to a new fixed point , intermediate between swollen ( saw ) phase and the collapsed phase and can not be viewed as a perturbation of the gaussian fixed point describing random walks .",
    "the nature of possible collapsed phases of linear polymers on fractals with a finite ramification number depends strongly on the geometrical constraints imposed by the connectivity properties of the the fractal , much more so than in the extended phase .",
    "as we already noted , for the @xmath0-simplex lattice with @xmath0 odd , a collapsed phase with a finite density of the polymer is not found .",
    "for the modified rectangular lattice , the behavior of linear polymer with self - attraction was studied in @xcite . here",
    "the number of variables needed to describe the polymer with self - attraction becomes rather large .",

    "to describe open chains , we would need 17 additional variables , making a total of 28 variables- a rather formidable number .",

    "equivalently , we study collapse when the attractive interaction is restricted to the first order rectangles .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to the analysis of closed polygons , we require only the five variables defined earlier in section 4.3 .",

    "the reason why the rod - like phase is found in this case is not clear : obviously the anisotropy of the lattice is responsible for it , but it does not matter so much in other ( swollen or collapsed ) phases , where the anisotropy is of the usual type ( the ratio of average diameter of an @xmath54-stepped walks in the @xmath63- and @xmath452- directions is a finite number ) .",
    "another different type of phase , labelled ` semi - compact ' phase was found by knezevic and vannimenus in their analysis of the collapse transition on the @xmath45 fractal @xcite . in this case , the connectivity of the graph is such that a linear polymer can not fill the available space with a finite density . for large value of the attraction strength @xmath383 the polymer shrinks into a `` semicompact '' state .",
    "in this phase , the average monomer density tends to zero for large polymers .",

    "<S> we study self - avoiding walks when the fractal dimension of the underlying lattice is just below @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider the case of linear polymers with attractive interactions , which on some fractals leads to a collapse transition . </S>",
    "<S> the fractals also provide a setting where the adsorption of a linear chain near on attractive substrate surface and the zipping - unzipping transition of two mutually interacting chains can be studied analytically . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss briefly the critical properties of branched polymers on fractals . </S>"
