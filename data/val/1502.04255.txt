    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are widely believed to result from the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( wd ) that is destabilized by mass transfer in a binary system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . even though their use as distance indicators in cosmology has sparked considerable interest in sne ia ( e.g. , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , many fundamental aspects of these explosions remain obscure .",
    "two major channels are thought to lead to sn ia explosions : the single degenerate ( sd ) scenario @xcite where a wd accretes matter from a non - degenerate companion and explodes when its mass grows close to the chandrasekhar limit ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) , and the double degenerate ( dd ) scenario @xcite where the explosion is triggered by the dynamical merger of two wds .",
    "unfortunately , the remarkable uniformity in sn ia light curves and spectra makes it difficult to infer the properties of the progenitors from the explosions themselves . because of this , most observational efforts to distinguish between progenitor scenarios for individual sne ia have focused on searches for circumstellar material @xcite or pre - existing / surviving stellar companions @xcite .    from the point of view of the sn nucleosynthesis ,",
    "the main difference between sd and dd systems is the central density of the wd at the onset of the thermonuclear runaway @xcite . in sd progenitors ,",
    "the exploding wd should always be close to @xmath2 , and have a dense ( @xmath3g@xmath4 ) core where electron captures can take place efficiently , leading to significant production of neutronized species like @xmath5ni and @xmath6mn @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the dd explosion scenarios that can best reproduce the observed properties of sne ia require lower masses and central densities for the primary wd , and therefore predict lower yields of these species @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the yield of @xmath5ni , @xmath6mn , and other neutronized species has been identified as a powerful diagnostic for sn ia progenitors @xcite . however",
    ", a combination of long half - lives and complex ionization issues at play in nebular spectra @xcite makes it extremely difficult to quantify these yields for individual objects during the optical sn phase @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations of evolved supernova remnants ( snrs ) offer an excellent opportunity to make robust measurements of the yields of neutronized species , as the innermost ejecta must have been thermalized by the reverse shock in the snrs , and will therefore be visible in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "3c397 ( g41.10.3 ) is an ideal target in this sense , since it is dynamically more evolved than other well - known type ia snrs ( i.e. , kepler , tycho , sn1006 ) .",
    "although 3c397 has sometimes been classified as a core - collapse snr due to its proximity to molecular clouds @xcite , most studies , including our own systematic analysis of fe k - shell emission in young and middle - aged snrs , agree on a type ia origin ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we present strong evidence for the presence of electron capture products in the x - ray spectrum of 3c397 , after proving that the snr is indeed evolved . in our analysis",
    ", we assume the distance to the snr to be 10kpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , but our main results and conclusions are not affected by the uncertainty in the distance estimate .    the errors quoted in the text and table , and the error bars in the figures are at the 1@xmath7 confidence level , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we analyzed archival _",
    "spitzer _ infrared ( ir ) and _ suzaku _ x - ray data from 3c397 .",
    "the ir observations were performed using the multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) and the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) during april 2005 .",
    "the x - ray observation was performed in october 2010 with a total effective exposure of 69ks for the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) .",
    "we followed the standard procedures for data reduction .",

    "therefore , ir spectra can constrain the density and mass of the swept - up ambient medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure[fig : spec]a shows the background - subtracted _ spitzer _ irs spectra from the two regions indicated in figure[fig : image ] . using the dust emission models and analysis procedures described in @xcite and @xcite , we fitted the 2133@xmath8 m continuum and derived post - shock proton number densities of @xmath10@xmath4 and @xmath11@xmath4 for the ne and sw rims , respectively .",
    "the average pre - shock density is therefore @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14g@xmath4 , where @xmath15 = @xmath16 g is the mean mass per hydrogen nucleus for solar abundances @xcite .",
    "the spatially - integrated ir flux from the snr is @xmath1720jy , which requires a swept - up dust mass of @xmath170.2@xmath18 .",
    "this estimate accounts for the fact that the mid - ir observations usually capture only @xmath1720% of the flux in this band , because the rest of the dust is colder and emits at longer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "taking the standard dust - to - gas ratio in the milky way @xcite , the estimated dust mass leads to a swept - up gas mass of @xmath1725@xmath18 .",
    "the snr shape can be well approximated by a @xmath19 ellipsoid , corresponding to a volume of @xmath20@xmath21 .",
    "the average ambient density that the snr blast wave has experienced is therefore estimated to be @xmath22g@xmath4 , consistent with ( and independent from ) the measurement from the ir spectra at the nominal distance to the snr . because the total swept - up mass ( @xmath1725@xmath1 ) is much larger than the typical sn ia ejecta mass ,",
    "we conclude that the reverse shock must have thermalized the innermost ejecta ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".      given the ism origin of the ir emission , the clear anticorrelation between the ir and x - ray morphologies ( fig.[fig : image ] ) suggests that the hard x - rays predominantly originate from the ejecta .",
    "the spectrum of the _ suzaku _ xis in the 59kev band extracted from the entire snr is shown in fig.[fig : spec]b .",
    "the data from the two active front - illuminated ccds ( xis0 and 3 ) were merged after background subtraction .",
    "the k@xmath23 atomic lines from four fe - peak elements ( cr , mn , fe , and ni ) are clearly resolved and detected at high significance .",
    "we measured their centroids and fluxes using gaussian models , and obtained the results given in table[tab : best ] . since the observed spectrum is dominated by metal - rich ejecta , we modeled the continuum with a bremsstrahlung representing emission from collisions between hot free electrons and highly - ionized heavy elements by using the gaunt factor calculation method described in @xcite .",

    "in fact , we found no evidence for a synchrotron x - ray filament , such as observed in young snrs ( e.g. , tycho , sn1006 ) , in the higher - resolution _ chandra _ image of 3c397 at the line - free energies of 4.15.3kev . during the spectral analysis",

    "the ni / fe mass ratio given in table1 was derived taking this contribution from the fe k@xmath30 lines into consideration .",
    "the classification of snrs as type ia or core collapse can sometimes be controversial , but the observational evidence for 3c397 strongly favors a sn ia origin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "although @xcite did propose a core - collapse origin for this snr , their classification was based on the high ambient density ( @xmath35g@xmath4 ) estimated from the soft x - ray spectrum in _ asca _ data .",
    "this technique can yield highly uncertain results in heavily absorbed objects like 3c397 .",
    "in fact , our ir observations indicate that the ambient density is much lower (  2.1 ) , more in line with other known type ia objects @xcite .",

    "( b ) same as panel ( a ) , but the values predicted for the innermost 0.2@xmath1   that is dominated by the n - nse regime ( blue ) and the other regions ( red ) from the @xmath2 models are separately shown .",
    "the observed mass ratios for 3c397 can be well explained by the nucleosynthesis that occurs in the n - nse regions of standard metallicity models .",
    "[ fig : abundance ] , width=272 ]    in sne ia , fe - peak nuclei are synthesized in three different burning regimes : incomplete si burning , nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) , and neutron - rich nse ( n - nse ) . in the incomplete si burning and nse regimes ,",
    "the yield of neutronized species ( mainly stable @xmath5ni and @xmath6mn after the radioactive decays of @xmath6co@xmath39@xmath6fe@xmath39@xmath6mn ) is controlled by the pre - explosion neutron excess carried by @xmath40ne in the wd , which in turn is set mainly by the metallicity of the wd progenitor @xcite . only in the case of near-@xmath2 wds , the innermost @xmath170.2@xmath41 ,",
    "is consumed in the n - nse regime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where density - driven electron captures generate a neutron excess independently of progenitor metallicity .",
    "the ni / fe mass ratio found in 3c397 ( 0.110.24 , which is independent from the distance to the snr ) is , to our knowledge , the highest reported in any sn ia observation , and it can be produced only in the n - nse regime ( and thus only in the near-@xmath2 wd ) at near - solar metallicities ( fig.2b of park et al .",
    "2013 ) .    to explore the relationship between the progenitor properties and the yields of the fe - peak elements in more detail , we calculated a grid of sn ia explosion models with a variety of progenitor wd masses ( @xmath42 = 0.88@xmath1 , 0.97@xmath1 , 1.06@xmath1 , 1.15@xmath1 , and @xmath2 @xmath13 1.37@xmath1 ) and metallicities reasonable for milky way stars @xcite ( @xmath43 = 0.18@xmath44 , 0.72@xmath44 , 1.8@xmath44 , and 5.4@xmath44 , where the updated value of @xcite is used for @xmath44 ) .",
    "the models were calculated with a version of the one - dimensional code described in @xcite , updated to include a more accurate treatment of the coupling between hydrodynamics and nuclear reactions ( e.  bravo et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . for the @xmath2 cases",
    ", delayed - detonation models @xcite with various deflagration - to - detonation transition densities ( @xmath45 ) were used .",
    "the sub-@xmath2 explosions were initiated as detonations at the wd center @xcite , which is a good approximation for a sn ia explosion initiated by the violent merging of binary wds @xcite .",
    "the mass of @xmath46ni synthesized in the different models is between 0.17m@xmath47 and 0.95m@xmath47 , in agreement with the range found in normal sn ia @xcite .",
    "as expected , the highest level of neutronization in the @xmath2 models is achieved in the n - nse regime .",
    "we note that this result is mainly driven by the core density of the wd , and hence one - dimensional sn ia models should capture the fundamental trends in the synthesis of neutronized species .    in figure[fig",
    ": abundance]a , the ni / fe and mn / fe mass ratios predicted by these explosion models are compared with the observed values .",
    "all the sub-@xmath2 models , regardless of progenitor mass or metallicity , fail to reproduce the high levels of neutronization found in 3c397 .",
    "we find that the @xmath2 models can match the observed mass ratios of both ni / fe and mn / fe , but they also require relatively high metallicities .",
    "a possible interpretation for this fact is that the hot plasma component responsible for the observed k - shell emission is dominated by the n - nse products , whereas the majority of the nse and si - burning products composes a lower - temperature component that is visible in the soft x - ray band ( i.e. , l - shell emission ) .",
    "an alternative is that the emission from the n - nse region is enhanced due to density inhomogeneities in the ejecta .",
    "otherwise , the metallicity should be indeed high .",
    "figure[fig : abundance]b shows the mass ratios for the same @xmath2 models where the values predicted for the n - nse region ( the innermost 0.2@xmath41 in our one - dimensional models ) and the other regions are split . the mass ratios determined from the k - shell spectra can be well explained by the n - nse components even with the relatively low metallicities , either alone or partially mixed with the rest of nse matter . since the n - nse regime is not expected in sub-@xmath2 wds , we can conclude that the progenitor of 3c397 must have had a mass very close to @xmath2 .",
    "a @xmath2 progenitor is naturally explained by the evolution of a wd slowly accreting mass from a non - degenerate companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , our results strongly suggest the sd scenario as the origin of this particular sn ia . in principle ,",
    "@xmath2 or even super-@xmath2 wds could arise in the dd scenario @xcite , but the properties of the galactic population of wd binaries make this a remote possibility at best @xcite .",
    "the large amount of neutronized material revealed by the x - ray spectrum of 3c397 might seem exceptional in comparison to other sn ia remnants like kepler @xcite or tycho @xcite ( see figure[fig : abundance ] ) , but it is important to emphasize that 3c397 is the only evolved type ia snr that has been observed to such depth by _",
    "suzaku_. this implies that sd progenitors might be common in the milky way , which is also suggested from the presence of circumstellar material confirmed in some young sn ia remnants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since the evidence in favor of dd progenitors is strong for other",
    "snrs @xcite , it appears that both progenitor channels must contribute significantly to the sn ia rate in star - forming galaxies .",
    "we have shown that the sn ia progenitor of 3c397 likely contained a wd with a mass very close to @xmath2 .",
    "this result is anchored by the strong k - shell emission from ni and mn in this snr , and is robust to the details of the data analysis and the sn nucleosynthesis calculations used to interpret the data .",
    "other work has claimed evidence for @xmath2 sn ia progenitors by modeling galactic chemical evolution @xcite , or by applying phenomenological radiative transfer relations to large samples of sn ia lightcurves @xcite , but these studies make strong assumptions about complex and highly uncertain processes .",
    "the analysis of the hard x - ray spectrum of 3c397 presented here might be the cleanest , most robust determination of the mass of a single sn ia progenitor to date , and strongly suggests an sd progenitor for this particular remnant .",
    "future deep observations with higher angular / spectral resolution including the soft x - ray band will allow us to investigate the spatial distribution of the elemental mass ratios and plasma properties ( i.e. , electron temperature and density ) . this will help understand why the nse and si - burning products are little visible in the hard x - ray band ( see  3 ) , and constrain the detailed explosion mechanism of @xmath2 sne ia as well as the dynamical evolution of their remnants .",
