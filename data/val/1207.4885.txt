    "high transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) processes in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) have been suggested as a probe to investigate the physics of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion ( a - a ) collisions more than a decade ago and have become a cornerstone of the experimental heavy - ion program both at rhic and lhc . yet , compared with for instance the modelling of the bulk medium evolution using hydrodynamics where an era of precision fits to differential data has begun ( see e.g. @xcite ) , theoretical progress in the physics of hard probes is slow .    partially , this can be attributed to the structure of the problem : hard probes are at the same time sensitive to the microscopical degrees of freedom of the medium and the macroscopical medium density distribution and evolution .",
    "thus high @xmath0 observables have the capability to potentially do both tomography and transport coefficient measurements in the medium , i.e. to constrain its microscopical and macroscopical dynamics .",
    "while the microscopical physics of the medium and hence the basic structure of the parton - medium interaction is currently in detail unknown , the density evolution ( in terms of fluid - dynamical modelling ) is constrained by bulk data , but not unambiguously determined . as a result , the description of any single observable in terms of a parton - medium interaction scenario and a medium evolution model is usually far from unique and does not allow a firm conclusion with regard to either question .",
    "however , systematic multi - observable studies of a matrix of parton - medium interaction and medium evolution models can reduce the allowed model space significantly , resulting in a class of models which shows good consistency across rhic and lhc observables .",
    "in vacuum , at the core of the computation of hard processes in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is the factorization of the hard , short - distance interaction part and the long - distance physics of initial state parton distributions and final state parton showers . in a medium ,",
    "qcd factorization is not strictly proven , but remains a plausible working assumption .",
    "a sufficiently large separation of hard and thermal momentum scale then ensures that the hard process itself receives no medium corrections and can serve as a standard - candle , producing high @xmath1 partons at a known and calculable rate .",
    "the partons emerging from the hard process are typically characterized by a large virtuality scale @xmath2 .",
    "if one takes the uncertainty relation to estimate the timescale at which intermediate shower states at lower virtuality can be formed , one finds @xmath3 with @xmath4 the virtual parton energy . comparing this scale with typical medium lifetimes @xmath5 fm",
    ", one finds that for typical rhic and lhc kinematics a significant part of the partonic shower evolution ( i.e. with @xmath6 ) takes place in the medium , with the shower being gradually boosted out of the medium at top lhc energies and on the other hand hadrons with large mass @xmath7 being produced in the medium .",
    "however , over a large kinematical range and for sufficiently light hadrons it can reasonably be assumed that the medium modification largely concerns the evolution of a parton shower with subsequent hadronization as in vacuum .    as a baseline example for in - medium shower modelling , consider a virtuality - ordered parton shower such as implemented in the pyshow algorithm @xcite",
    "this is treated as an interated series of splittings of a parent into two daughter partons @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 and where the virtuality of partons in terms of @xmath11 decreases in each branching .",
    "the splitting probability is given by        where @xmath13 are perturbatively calculable objects , the so - called splitting kernels .",
    "the splittings cease when the parton virtuality reaches a non - perturbative lower scale @xmath14 gev at which point a hadronization model needs to be used . in this way",
    ", the original high virtuality of the shower initiator is converted into the transverse momentum distribution of the final shower partons ( and the initial virtuality sets a kinematic bound for observables like jet shapes ) .",
    "an important thing to note is that the splitting kernels @xmath13 are scale invariant , i.e. they do not depend on an absolute momentum scale . as a result ,",
    "the fragmentation functions generated by a series of splittings is self - similar ( the momentum distribution of hadrons in a subjet looks almost the same as the distribution in the whole jet when plotted as a function of @xmath15 ) and up to logarithmic corrections has no strong energy dependence .    estimating the timescale associated with the initial , hard branchings which largely determine jet shape and subjet structure , one finds @xmath16 fm , i.e. well before any medium can be formed .",
    "this gives rise to the expectation that subject structure and jet shape at high @xmath0 should not be very sensitive to medium modifications .",
    "there are two main processes by which this pattern can be modified in a medium : 1 ) direct loss of energy ( by elastic collisions , drag ,  ) into the medium as parametrized by a transport coefficient @xmath17 and 2 ) enhanced soft gluon radiation by medium - induced virtuality as parametrized by a transport coefficient @xmath18 .",
    "the first mechanism is in general incoherent and the energy is lost into the medium , the second mechanism involves a de - coherence time for the radiated gluon and transfers energy from the leading parton into an increased number of subleading shower partons .",
    "note that this distinction can be made on average on the basis of transport coefficients , but not for a single interaction graph with the medium which may involve both direct and radiative energy loss .",
    "a recently suggested additional mechanism is the modification of color flow by the medium , leading to a modification of the hadronic shower evolution @xcite .",
    "models may now be classified based on what part of the dynamics they include , how they treat the medium and how they solve the shower evolution equations .",
    "the most complete approach are models which simulate the whole in - medium shower evolution such as jewel @xcite , yajem @xcite , q - pythia @xcite or resummed higher twist ( ht ) @xcite . however , if one is only interested in observables which probe the leading shower fragments , such as single inclusive high @xmath0 hadron suppression , which probe dominantly showers in which a large fraction of the energy flows through a single parton , then leading parton energy loss modelling in which the medium evolution is cast into an energy loss probability @xmath19 before vacuum fragmentation is applied is sufficient .",
    "models of this type include the asw @xcite , amy @xcite or whdg @xcite frameworks .",
    "finally , in hybrid approaches a vacuum shower is computed down to some scale , then the produced partons are put on - shell and each propagated through the medium using a leading - parton energy loss model .",
    "an example for hybrid modelling is martini @xcite .    of considerable interest",
    "is how the medium is included into the modelling process .",
    "a number of models come with an explicit treatment of medium partons and their interaction with shower partons , typically as a thermal gas of quark and gluon quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "such a description requires that the medium is , at least to some degree , perturbatively tractable , which is not in line with the basic assumption underlying almost ideal hydrodynamical modelling which assumes that the medium is strongly coupled and the mean free path essentially vanishes .",
    "usually an explicit treatment of interactions with medium partons breaks the scale invariance of the fragmentation function around the momentum scale of the medium partons and below , while it largely remains intact above .",
    "in addition , the medium provides additional kinematic phase space for transverse shower broadening .",
    "a different approximation is to cast all medium effects into a modification of the splitting probability , in essence replacing @xmath20 with the detailed form of @xmath21 motivated by a specific physics scenario as done e.g. in q - pythia @xcite .",
    "such a prescription explicitly conserves energy and momentum inside the shower , i.e. there is no additional phase space for transverse broadening .",
    "it also perserves scale invariance of the fragmentation function , but it alters its shape to a different functional form .    finally , the medium can be ( without any explicit reference to its degrees of freedom ) appear via transport coefficients such as @xmath22 and alter the kinematics of propagating partons as implemented in yajem @xcite .",
    "this again breaks scale invariance of the fragmentation function around the medium momentum scale and below and leads to additional phase space for transverse broadening .",
    "there are two main strategies to solve the shower evolution equations  analytical and mote - carlo ( mc ) techniques . in general , analytical techniques",
    "get exact treatment of quantum interference effects while they often rely on kinematic approximations such as eikonal propagation or infinite parent parton energy which violate energy - momentum conservation .",
    "in contrast , mc frameworks usually have exact kinematics , but have to resort to phenomenological prescriptions for interference effects .",
    "it is immediately evident that the combination of all observables cuts the available model space down much more than any single observable .",
    "most of the constraints are provided by the combination of the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath23 at lhc which probes the dynamics of leading partons in combination with a dihadron correlation @xmath24 which is a probe of subleading fragment dynamics .",
    "current jet measurements do not have strong constraining power beyond this , however they do highlight the need to go beyond a purely probabilistic implementation of medium modification and also provide constraints for transverse dynamics of showers .",
    "a number of conclusions with regard to the nature of jet - medium interaction can be drawn from this :    * the combined data is compatible with a fairly standard pqcd picture of medium - induced radiation and a subleading component of elastic interactions leading to energy transfer into the medium * there is no evidence for exotic scenarios , the data neither indicate an @xmath25 dependence of energy loss as suggested by some variants of ads / cft inspired models nor a modification of the hadronization stage . *",
    "data from rhic and lhc consistently indicate that some moderate amount of energy is transferred from the hard parton directly into the non - perturbative medium rather than into subleading jet fragments .",
    "however , the amount of direct energy transfer is constrained by pathlength - dependent observables and found to be significantly smaller than if the medium can be described as a near - ideal quark - gluon gas .",
    "this may imply that the observed degrees of freedom in the medium are massive or correlated quasiparticles .    to make these conclusions more quantitative ,",
    "further high - statistics multi - differential measurements are needed from the experimental side , followed by systematic multi - observable studies from theory .",
    "in particular , the systematics of h - h , jet - h and @xmath26-h correlations ( with decreasing geometry bias ) as a function of the reaction plane angle for various system centralities is expected to be a sensitive probe of both the parton - medium interaction mechanism and the medium density evolution .",
    "once these questions are reliably addressed , the precise nature of the mechanism by which the energy deposited from hard partons is carried by the medium presents itself as the next goal ."
