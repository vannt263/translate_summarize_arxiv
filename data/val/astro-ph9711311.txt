    "inferring the true radial dependence of supernova ( sn ) properties in their parent galaxies from observations of projected radial distributions is a tricky business . for example ,",
    "bartunov , makarova , and tsvetkov ( 1992 ) could find no significant difference between the radial distributions of sne of type ia ( sne  ia ) and type ii ( sne  ii ) in disk galaxies , while van den bergh ( 1997 ) and wang , hflich , & wheeler ( 1997 ) reach opposite conclusions as to whether sne  ia or sne  ii are more centrally concentrated .",
    "wang et  al also conclude that sne  ia farther than 7.5 kpc from the centers of their parent galaxies are more homogeneous in absolute magnitude and @xmath0 color than those that are closer to the centers .",
    "an obvious and generally recognized difficulty in this kind of work is that only the projected distance of an sn from the center of its galaxy , not the true distance , is observed .",
    "another difficulty , that to our knowledge has not previously been explored , is that extinction of sne by dust in their parent galaxies can affect the observed radial dependence of sn properties .    to make a first exploration of the effects of extinction on the radial dependence of sn properties , we have used a monte carlo technique together with assumed spatial distributions of dust and sn progenitors in a simple model of a characteristic sn  producing disk galaxy .",
    "the model is described in section 2 , and the extinction distributions and projected radial distributions that it predicts for the various sn types are presented .",
    "model predictions of how the brightness distributions of the various sn types depend on projected radius are presented and compared with observation in section 3 .",
    "section  4 presents a brief discussion .",
    "our monte carlo technique for studying the visibility of sne and novae ( hatano et  al .",
    "1997a , b , c ) was inspired by a study of the visibility of galactic sne by dawson and johnson ( 1994 ) . in their model and in hatano",
    "( 1997a , b ) , which were concerned with sne and novae in the galaxy , a double exponential distribution of dust was used , with a radial scale length of five kpc and a vertical scale height of 0.1 kpc .",
    "core  collapse events ( sne  ii and ibc ) were distributed like the dust except that they were not allowed to occur within three kpc of the center in view of the lack of evidence for much recent star formation in the central regions of our galaxy .",
    "sne  ia consisted of two spatially interpenetrating components : disk sne  ia had a double exponential distribution with a scale length of five kpc and a vertical scale height of 0.35 kpc and they were not truncated at three kpc .",
    "bulge sne  ia were spherically distributed ( in kpc ) as @xmath1 .",
    "disk sne  ia outnumbered bulge sne  ia by a factor of seven , consistent with the estimated galactic disk  to  bulge mass ratio ( van der kruit 1990 ) .",
    "the bulge was truncated at three kpc and the disk at 20 kpc . for more detailed descriptions of the model ,",
    "see dawson and johnson ( 1994 ) and hatano et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "hatano et al . (",
    "1997c ) was concerned with novae in m31 .",
    "because the dust density in m31 is known to peak not at the center , but well out in the disk where most of the current star formation is taking place , the model dust distribution was modified accordingly .",
    "recently sodroski et al . (",
    "1997 ) have found that in the galaxy , too , the dust density peaks off center , at a radius of about 5 kpc , where the total face  on extinction through the disk is @xmath2 . for the present study we have made a simple parameterization of the radial dependence of the total face  on extinction through the disk , after figure 9 of sodrowski et  al .",
    "this radial dependence of the dust , together with a retained vertical scale height of 0.1 kpc , leads to the following expression for the @xmath3band extinction per kpc , @xmath4 , in the plane of the disk :    @xmath5 @xmath6    thus the dust density rises from zero at the center of the model to a maximum value at 5 kpc and then falls to zero at 17.5 kpc .",
    "this particular parameterization gives a rather high value of 3.8 mag kpc@xmath7 in the plane of the disk at @xmath8 kpc , i.e. , at the radial distance of the sun in the galaxy , but considering that large galaxies produce more sne and tend to be more dusty than small ones ( van den bergh & pierce 1990 ) , it probably is not unreasonable for this initial exploration of the effects of extinction .",
    "figure  1 shows the model extinction distributions for bulge sne  ia , disk sne  ia , and core ",
    "collapse sne , each for five different galaxy inclinations as well as for a random distribution of inclinations .",
    "note that for any inclination , even edge  on , the distributions for bulge and disk sne  ia are strongly peaked at small values of @xmath9 .",
    "( for the adopted disk  to  bulge sn  ia ratio of seven , the total distribution for sne  ia is much like the distribution for disk sne  ia . )",
    "core  collapse sne tend to be more extinguished than sne  ia owing to their smaller vertical scale height .",
    "table 1 quantifies the model extinction distributions .",
    "column ( 1 ) gives the cosine of the inclination of the model , where @xmath10 refers to the face  on case .",
    "columns ( 2)(4 ) refer to bulge sne  ia ( ia  b ) and list the mean extinction @xmath11 , the mean extinction of an `` extinction  limited subset '' of bulge sne  ia that have @xmath12 , and the fraction of the events in that subset .",
    "columns ( 5)(7 ) give the same information for disk sne  ia ( ia  d ) and columns ( 8)(10 ) are for core  collapse sne ( cc ) . in the edge  on case the mean extinction of all sn types becomes high , but of course there would be a strong observational selection acting against the discovery of severely extinguished events .",
    "it is interesting that the mean extinction of the extinction  limited subsets",
    "_ decreases _ as inclination increases , i.e. , when the model is highly inclined the extinction tends to be all or nothing .",
    "note that even in the edge  on case substantial fractions of bulge and disk sne  ia make it into the extinction  limited subsets , while only a small fraction of the core  collapse sne do .",
    "column ( 10 ) shows that , to the extent that an extinction of 0.6 mag is sufficient to significantly reduce the probability that a sn is discovered , this particular model is dusty enough to support an inclination  dependent observational discrimination against the discovery of core ",
    "collapse sne ( cf .",
    "van den bergh 1993 ; tammann 1994 ; cappellaro & turatto 1997 ) .",
    "our technique allows us to plot model projected radial distributions of sne for comparison with observed distributions .",
    "the model distributions presented here have been calculated with a disk truncation radius of 30 rather than 20 kpc because some sne have been observed beyond 20 kpc .",
    "figure  2 shows normalized projected radial distributions for disk sne  ia and core ",
    "collapse sne , for five inclinations and a random distribution of inclinations . as the inclination increases , the projected distributions shift toward the central regions .",
    "the behavior of the core ",
    "collapse sne is especially interesting : in the face  on case , by construction , there are no core  collapse events within three kpc , but in the edge  on case plenty are projected into the innermost regions because of the small vertical scale height .",
    "this illustrates that the observational presence of core  collapse events projected near the center does not guarantee the actual existence of core  collapse events near the center .",
    "more generally , figure  2 illustrates the difficulty of inferring details about the relative radial distributions of sn types from observations of their projected radial distributions in samples that include highly inclined galaxies , especially if the sn types have different vertical scale heights .",
    "van den bergh ( 1997 ) studied projected sn radial distributions in a sample of disk galaxies restricted to those having @xmath13 , to minimize extinction and projection effects , and he tentatively concluded that sne  ia are more centrally concentrated than sne  ii .",
    "wang et  al ( 1997 ) presented calculated projected radial distributions , analagous to our figure  3 but with very different model parameters .",
    "they compared to observed distributions and tentatively concluded the opposite  that sne  ii are more centrally condensed than sne  ia . because wang et  al . did not use a smaller vertical scale height for sne  ii than for sne  ia , they probably overestimated the true central concentration of sne  ii relative to that of sne  ia ; thus it appears to us that van den bergh s conclusion is more likely to be correct .",
    "at this point we have to specify the sn luminosity functions . after hatano et  al ( 1997a ) we adopt gaussian distributions of the intrinsic absolute magnitudes of sne  ia , ibc , and ii , with mean absolute magnitudes of -19.5 , -18.0 , and -17.0 , and dispersions of 0.2 , 0.3 , and 1.2 , respectively .",
    "the top panel of figure  3 shows the model distribution of absolute magnitude as viewed by the external observer who has not corrected for parent  galaxy extinction ( i.e. , the quantity @xmath14 ) for sne  ia .",
    "those at large projected radial distances are practically unextinguished , while some of those at smaller projected distances are severely extinguished .",
    "the lower panel of figure  3 shows a corresponding observational plot , constructed from data in the june 6 , 1997 version of the asiago supernova catalogue with distances based on parent  galaxy radial velocity and @xmath15 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "apparent magnitudes have been corrected for foreground extinction in the galaxy but not for extinction in the parent galaxies .",
    "considering the simplicity of our model , and that the lower panel is affected by strong observational bias against the discovery of severely extinguished events , the general resemblance of the two panels of figure  3 is satisfactory .",
    "figure  3 strongly suggests that the effects of parent  galaxy extinction are likely to be the cause of much of the observed difference in absolute  magnitude dispersion between sne  ia within and beyond 7.5 kpc , a difference first pointed out by wang et  al .",
    ". it should be noted , however , that for a small sample of sne  ia having high  quality data , wang et  al . also found an excess of _ overluminous _ sne  ia within 7.5 kpc , which of course can not be explained in terms of extinction .",
    "wang et  al also called attention to an apparent observational deficit of sne  ia in the innermost one kpc of their parent galaxies .",
    "the upper panel of figure  3 shows that our model predicts the presence of observationally bright sne  ia ( mostly bulge sne  ia ) projected into the central kpc , while none appear in the observational plot ( lower panel of figure  3 ) .",
    "this supports the suggestion by wang et  al .",
    "that bulge populations may be poor producers of sne  ia .",
    "( the conclusion of wang et  al that sne  ia therefore do not come from novae does not follow for us , because we [ hatano et  al .",
    "1997b , c ] have argued that galactic and even m31 novae do not come primarily from the bulge populations as is usually assumed . )",
    "figure 4 is like figure  3 , but for sne  ii .",
    "although the effects of the broad adopted luminosity function for sne  ii are apparent , the upper panel of figure 4 shows the same general tendency as figure  3 for many severely extinguished model sne to appear at relatively small projected distances from the center .",
    "( some are extinguished right off the top of figure  4 . )",
    "the large triangle in the upper panel serves to call attention to predicted deficit of bright sne  ii in the central regions . in the model",
    "the deficit reflects the tendency of sne  ii that are projected into the central regions to be substantially extinguished .",
    "although more data are needed to reach a final conclusion , this deficit does appear to be present in the observations ( lower panel ) .",
    "in the same way the model predicts a deficit of bright sne  ibc in the central regions , and the inset to the lower panel shows that although the numbers are still smaller , observations of sne  ibc are at least consistent with the presence of the deficit .",
    "we have explored the consequences for the core ",
    "collapse deficit of altering the dustiness of the model . halving the dustiness makes the model deficit less pronounced than the observational one , while doubling the dustiness extinguishes nearly all centrally projected core ",
    "collapse sne beyond detectability . measuring",
    "the radial dependence of controlled samples of sne in galaxies appears to be a promising way to constrain the amount and the distribution of dust in galaxies , which is a controversial issue ( valentijn 1990 ; burstein , haynes , & faber 1991 ) .",
    "the results shown in figure 4 lead us to suggest an alternative to the classical explanation of the selection effect discussed by shaw ( 1979 )  the observational deficit of sne in the central regions of remote galaxies relative to nearer galaxies .",
    "( see van den bergh ( 1997 ) and wang et  al ( 1997 ) for plots that illustrate the shaw effect with present data . )",
    "shaw s interpretation , which has been generally accepted , was that the effect is caused by the increasing difficulty , with distance , of discovering sne against the bright central regions of galaxies .",
    "but if this is the primary cause of the shaw effect then in figure  4 we would expect to see a deficit of observationally _ dim _ sne in the central regions , because they would be more readily lost than bright ones .",
    "then the large triangle in the lower panel of figure  4 should be upside down .",
    "instead , the lower panel of figure 4 shows a deficit of observationally _ bright _ sne  ii in the central regions , as predicted by our model .",
    "therefore we suggest that the shaw effect for sne  ii ( and sne  ibc ) comes about at least in part because core ",
    "collapse sne projected into the central regions of galaxies tend to be observationally dim , and the difficulty of discovering dim sne increases with distance .",
    "our model does not predict such a deficit for sne  ia , but it is not so clear that there really is an observational shaw effect for sne  ia ( see figure  3 of van den bergh [ 1997 ] and figure  1 of wang et  al [ 1997 ] ) .",
    "our simple model of the spatial distributions of dust and sn progenitors in a characteristic sn  producing disk galaxy predicts that owing to extinction , sne projected into the inner regions of their parent galaxies tend to be observationally dimmer and to have a much larger magnitude dispersion than sne in the outer regions . as wang et  al ( 1997 ) first showed , such is the case for sne  ia . in our model",
    "the effect is severe enough , for core ",
    "collapse sne , to produce a deficit of observationally bright events projected into the central regions . for core ",
    "collapse sne , such a deficit does appear to be present in the observational data . although the need for improving on the assumption of a single characteristic sn  producing disk galaxy in future work is obvious , this effect of extinction is likely to be real .",
    "it has obvious implications for such things as using high  redshift sne  ia to determine the cosmic deceleration ( avoid extinction by using events in the outer regions of their parent galaxies ) ; for determining the true relative radial distributions of sn types ( extinction can cause confusion , especially when comparing sn types that have different vertical scale heights ) , and for determining sn rates ( substantial corrections for incompleteness that depend on parent  galaxy dustiness are required ) .",
    "adam fisher wrote the original version of our monte carlo code .",
