    "the addition or removal of neutrons from stable isotopes has been shown in many cases to drastically alter the structure of the nucleus  @xcite . in moving towards the neutron",
    "dripline the typical shell gaps observed in stable nuclei have been shown to disappear and new magic numbers are observed .",
    "for example , in the dripline nucleus @xmath5o a large energy difference was measured between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 orbitals indicating a new magic number at @xmath9 = 16  @xcite . determining how the shell structure changes for nuclei with extreme neutron - to - proton ratios is critical for providing stringent constraints on theoretical calculations .",
    "such measurements have already been used to demonstrate the importance of three - nucleon forces in describing the properties of very neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite .",
    "radioactive - ion beam facilities have made it possible to produce and study nuclei at and beyond the neutron dripline .",
    "the neutron dripline is defined experimentally only up to the oxygen isotopes , where @xmath5o is known to be the last bound isotope  @xcite .",
    "the fluorine dripline is known to extend at least to @xmath10f but heavier isotopes have not been confirmed bound or unbound .",
    "a striking difference is observed in comparing the location of the neutron dripline for the oxygen and fluorine isotopes . while the 8 protons in oxygen are able to bind up to 16 neutrons , the addition of a single proton enables at least 22 neutrons to be bound .",
    "no published theoretical calculation has been able to simultaneously reproduce both the oxygen and fluorine driplines .",
    "thus , measuring the properties of the unbound oxygen isotopes can constrain the theoretical calculations and help offer insight into the structure of the neutron dripline .",
    "predictions of the two - neutron separation energy for @xmath0o have shown large variations  @xcite .",
    "an experimental measurement of the two - neutron separation energy would constrain the theoretical calculations and , thus , provide new insights into the changing structure of the neutron dripline .    these exotic dripline nuclei can also exhibit unique types of decay which can provide additional insight into the structure of the nucleus .",
    "goldanksy was the first to propose that the simultaneous emission of two protons could be observed given a scenario in which the intermediate state was positioned above the initial state  @xcite .",
    "similarly , if the same conditions are found at the neutron dripline the direct emission of two neutrons would be expected .",
    "this scenario exists for the two - neutron unbound @xmath1be , which should decay through the direct emission of two neutrons to @xmath6be .",
    "the limiting cases for the simultaneous two - neutron emission would be a phase - space decay where the neutrons exhibit no correlation or the emission of a dineutron cluster .",
    "the more exotic dineutron decay is of great interest as multiple studies have shown indirect evidence for the presence of a dineutron in neutron - rich halo nuclei , such as @xmath11he and @xmath12li  @xcite .",
    "however , a direct measurement of a dineutron - like emission has not yet been observed .",
    "two - neutron unbound nuclei provide an excellent opportunity to observe a dineutron type decay since the emission occurs directly from the ground state in comparison to measurements of the two - neutron decay from bound nuclei where the system must be excited to overcome the two - neutron separation energy and , thus , the correlations may be altered relative to the ground state .    in the following ,",
    "we report on the first observations of the ground state resonances of @xmath0o and @xmath1be .",
    "these results were first reported in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite for @xmath0o and @xmath1be , respectively .",
    "the radioactive @xmath2f and @xmath3b beams were produced at the coupled cyclotron facility at the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory at michigan state university .",
    "two separate experiments were completed to measure the ground state resonances . in each case , a stable primary beam was fragmented on a thick be production target producing a wide variety of isotopes .",
    "the a1900 fragment separator was used to select the desired secondary beam through the removal of the other reaction products and primary beam .",
    "the relevant information about each experiment is presented in table  [ t : exp ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t : exp ]    measurement of the three - body decay ( frag + n + n ) required coincident detection of both neutrons and the residual fragment , which was accomplished using the modular neutron array ( mona )  @xcite and the large gap 4  tm sweeper magnet  @xcite . the large area neutron detector , mona , is composed of 144 plastic scintillator bars . light guides and photomultiplier tubes",
    "are attached to the ends of each bar for detection of the light produced from the interaction of the neutron(s ) .",
    "each bar is 200 cm @xmath13 10 cm @xmath13 10 cm and are typically configured into 9 walls , each 16 bars high .",
    "the time - of - flight ( tof ) of the neutrons to mona is measured with respect to a scintillator placed in front of the target . the angle and energy of a neutron can be determined from the interaction point in the scintillator bar and the tof , respectively .",
    "the sweeper magnet bends the charged particles @xmath1443@xmath15 into a suite of position sensitive charged - particle detectors .",
    "both the particle identification and kinematical properties of the charged fragments can be determined from the sweeper magnet detectors ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .    from the measured energy and angle of the neutrons and",
    "charged particle , the invariant mass of @xmath0o ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath1be ( @xmath17 ) could be calculated .",
    "the 3-body decay energy could then be calculated as @xmath18 in the @xmath0o case , where @xmath19 is the rest mass of @xmath5o and @xmath20 is the neutron mass . in the two - neutron decays ,",
    "the 2-body decay energy can also be examined and is calculated , for the @xmath0o example , as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the invariant mass calculated from the charged particle and the first detected neutron in mona .",
    "a detailed monte carlo simulation has been developed to simulate the production and decay of the unbound nuclei . while a general discussion of the monte carlo simulation is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , the simulation of the neutron interactions in mona is of particular importance . in measuring the two - neutron decays , it is imperative that the simulation be able to accurately reproduce the multiple scattering of neutrons within the array .",
    "a single neutron can scatter twice producing a false 2n signal in comparison to two neutrons each interacting within the array providing a true 2n signal .",
    "the simulation must be able to correctly reproduce the ratio of false to true 2n events in order to allow for the resonance parameters of the experimental data to be extracted .",
    "the mona simulation is built upon the ` geant4 ` framework  @xcite , which allows for the tracking of each neutron interaction throughout the array . in order to validate the accuracy of the monte carlo simulation , a `` clean '' experimental data set",
    "is required for comparison .",
    "ideally this would be a case where only a single neutron is impinging on mona .",
    "the measurement of the ground state of @xmath1b by spyrou _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite was chosen for this reason .",
    "a one - proton knockout from @xmath3c produced the unbound @xmath1b , which immediately decayed into @xmath23b + n. for each detected @xmath23b fragment there should only be a single neutron in coincidence .",
    "therefore , any multiple interaction events observed in mona must correspond to the multiple scattering of the single neutron and should allow for a detailed comparison with the simulation .    in fig .",
    "[ f : menate ] the multiplicity and energy deposited distributions from hits in coincidence with @xmath23b are shown from the experiment in comparison to the ` geant4 ` simulation .",
    "the standard physics classes , referred to as g4-physics , included in the ` geant4 ` package are unable to reproduce either of the distributions .",
    "this was found to be related to the treatment of the inelastic neutron - carbon reaction channels  @xcite . in the g4-physics simulation ,",
    "the ` geant4 ` cascade model is used to determine how the different possible inelastic channels are partitioned  @xcite . in comparison to the g4-physics , a custom neutron interaction model , referred to as menate_r  @xcite ,",
    "was incorporated into the ` geant4 ` framework .",
    "while the neutron(s ) was still transported using the typical ` geant4 ` methods , the menate_r class determined how each interaction was treated .",
    "the menate_r code determines the partitioning of each of the different inelastic neutron - carbon reaction channels based on a compilation of experimental cross sections .",
    "thus , the relative rates for each reaction channel should be accurately reproduced .",

    "were used to remove false 2n events . in fig .",
    "[ f : cuts ] the relative distance ( @xmath24 ) , angle ( @xmath25 ) , and velocity ( @xmath26 ) are shown from the experimental @xmath1b decay data  @xcite and the simulation using menate_r . since each event in the experiment should only have one neutron in coincidence , the distributions , which require two hits in mona , are representative of multiple scattering or false 2n events .",
    "it is clear that false 2n signals are largely correlated with a small @xmath24 , roughly less than 30  cm , and a @xmath26 less than about 10  cm / ns ( which is equivalent to the beam velocity ) .",
    "this demonstrates the basis for the applied 2n casuality cuts used in the analysis of the @xmath0o and @xmath1be .",
    "the most important aspect is the excellent agreement shown between the experimental data and the monte carlo simulation .",
    "this indicates that the simulation is able to accurately reproduce the multiple scatterings of the neutrons within mona and should , therefore , be able to reproduce the effects of applying the 2n causality cuts .",
    "as mentioned above , the unbound ground state of @xmath0o was searched for using a one - proton knockout from a @xmath2f beam and measuring the triple coincidence of the charged particle and two neutrons . while theoretical predictions have varied significantly on the prediction of the ground state position",
