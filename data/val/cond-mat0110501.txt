    "the simulation of the dynamics of colloidal suspensions is a challenging task .",
    "the reason is that the movement of the colloidal particles can be on a time scale which is orders of magnitudes slower than that of the solvent particles ( e.g.  seconds versus picoseconds )",
    ". therefore , simulation methods such as molecular dynamics , that account for the fluid particles explicitly , are not well suited to study the dynamics of colloidal suspensions because one would spend most of the simulation time solving the equations of motion of the fluid particles .",
    "the situation for charged colloids is even worse because one has to take into account the long  ranged coulomb interactions which are already very time consuming in simple ionic liquids .",
    "one possibility to circumvent these problems is to avoid explicit simulation of the solvent particles and describing the interaction between the colloidal particles by means of an effective potential . in the case of charged colloidal systems",
    "this is usually a yukawa  like potential which gives in many cases quite an accurate description of interaction  dependent properties  @xcite .",
    "but the approach with effective interactions neglects completely the hydrodynamic interactions between the colloidal particles which stem from the momentum transport through the solvent . in order to take this into account one",
    "has to treat the hydrodynamics of the solvent at least on a coarse  grained level .",
    "an effective scheme , that was developed to solve efficiently the navier ",
    "stokes equations , is the so  called lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) .",
    "the lbm is a pre  averaged version of a lattice gas , i.e. , a boltzmann equation is solved on a lattice such that the navier ",
    "stokes equations are recovered ( reviews of the method are the refs .",
    "recently , the lbm was applied to simulate the dynamics of colloidal systems , such as the rotational and translational short  time dynamics of colloids @xcite , the diffusion of colloidal particles in confined geometry  @xcite , and the dynamics in porous media  @xcite .",
    "also other complex systems like polymer solutions @xcite have been investigated by lbm .",
    "several attempts to apply the lbm to charged systems have been reported in the literature .",
    "he and li  @xcite proposed a scheme which is appropriate to study electrochemical processes in an electrolyte .",
    "however , in this method it is assumed that the fluid is _ locally _ electrically neutral which can not be true for the part of an electrolyte forming the electrical double layer around a macroion .",
    "thus , the lbm of he and li can not be used to describe the dynamics of suspensions of charged colloids .",
    "a different lbm for charged systems was suggested by warren  @xcite .",
    "the central idea of this method is the introduction of external charge densities @xmath1 for the ionic species of type @xmath2 which are propagated with the one particle distribution function of the lb equation by means of the so  called moment propagation method  @xcite .",
    "these ionic densities are coupled back to the mass current of the lb equation via a chemical potential which consists of a term @xmath3 and a term proportional to the electrostatic potential such that it only gives a contribution if the ion densities are not distributed as expected in equilibrium by a boltzmann distribution ( e.g.  because of an external electrical field ) .",
    "finally , the electrostatic potential is determined from the charge densities by means of a poisson equation solver",
    ". the main drawback of warren s method is that the charge densities are introduced as additional physical quantities which are independent from the mass density in the lb equation , and thus , this method is not self  consistent and the correctness of coupling of the charge density to the mass current is not obvious .",
    "our lbm for charged colloidal suspensions is inspired by warren s approach , but it does not introduce ionic species as additional quantities .",
    "the details of our method can be found in the following sections",
    ". we apply it to the determination of the sedimentation velocity of an array of charged spheres in an electrolyte .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we give a brief introduction into the electrokinetic equations of motion with which we model the dynamics of the fluid . in sec .",
    "iii the lbm is presented which solves the latter equations of motion on a lattice .",

    "and in sec .",

    "the discrete space of velocities @xmath48 is chosen such that no artificial anisotropic terms appear in the corresponding equations in the continuous limit . in our case",
    "the velocity space consists of 18 vectors of which from a given lattice node 6 point to the nearest and 12 to next  nearest neighbors on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "this velocity space can be constructed by projecting the unit vectors of a four dimensional fchc lattice onto three dimensions .",
    "it is one possible choice of a velocity space which exhibits the required isotropy .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath44 consists of two steps , a collision and a propagation step . in the collision",

    "the density @xmath52 and the mass current @xmath53 are given by the zeroth and first moment of @xmath54 , respectively , @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "in the case of the charged system a one  particle distribution function for each ion species and a neutral part is required .",
    "the purpose of the neutral part is to keep the viscosity essentially constant through the fluid .",
    "thus , it is chosen such that its value at a given lattice point is much higher than that of the ionic densities .",

    "in this section we present the results for the sedimentation velocity of an array of charged spheres in an electrolyte solution .",

    "finally we address the question whether our results are in agreement with a dynamic light scattering experiment by schumacher and van de ven  @xcite .",
    "they measured the diffusion constant @xmath182 for a system of gold particles in distilled water .",
    "note that @xmath183 is equal to @xmath0 .",
    "the radius of the gold particles was around 20  nm and their volume fraction @xmath184  % .",
    "different data sets were determined by changing the value of @xmath142 with different salts .",
    "we consider here the experimental data points measured with sodium chloride which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] in comparison to our simulation data at @xmath185 and at @xmath175 for @xmath123 .",
    "it is interesting that the experimental data can be very well described by the simulation curve for @xmath185 although the experiment was done at a very small volume fraction of gold particles and the curve for @xmath175 deviates strongly from the experimental data .",
    "more systematic experiments , e.g.  for different volume fractions , would be necessary to clarify this discrepancy .",
    "we have developed a lbm for the simulation of the dynamics of suspensions of charged colloidal particles . in this method",
    "a set of non  linear , coupled electrokinetic equations is solved which consists of convective diffusion equations for the ion densities @xmath1 ( @xmath58 ) , the linearized navier  stokes equations for the mass current @xmath73 , and the poisson equation for the electrostatic potential @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , a neutral fluid characterized by the density @xmath35 can be introduced in order to keep the viscosity in the fluid essentially constant .",
    "the propagation of @xmath1 and @xmath73 is computed by means of one  particle distribution functions @xmath72 for each species @xmath2 .",
    "but in contrast to the normal lbm @xmath1 and @xmath73 are not simply given as zeroth and first moments of the @xmath72 s , respectively .",
    "this is due to the coupling of the ionic part of the fluid to the gradient of @xmath18 which leads to an additional diffusive term in the propagation of the ion densities and a body force term in the propagation of the mass current @xmath73 .",
    "the electrostatic potential is determined from the ion densities by means of a poisson equation solver for which we use a successive overrelaxation scheme .",
    "our method is fast , stable and easy to implement .",
    "we have verified our numerical scheme by means of a chapman  enskog expansion .    as an application we applied our method to determine the reduced sedimentation velocity @xmath0 for an array of charged spheres on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "we determined @xmath0 as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath142 for different volume fractions of macroions @xmath166 .",
    "we compared our results with an analytical formula first derived by booth which is valid in the limit of a weakly charged , isolated macroion in an unbounded electrolyte .",
    "booth s theory starts with an expansion of @xmath0 in powers of the macroion charge @xmath28 of which the lowest non  vanishing order , @xmath186 is taken into account .",
    "we gave evidence that we recover booth s result in the limit @xmath167 .",
    "for about @xmath181 corrections to the booth theory become important . up to @xmath176 our simulation data can be well described by an expansion up to order @xmath187 .",
    "these numerical data could be used to test theories that go beyond the booth level .",
    "we mention that very recently also a mode coupling theory with hydrodynamic interactions was shown to be in agreement with booth s theory @xcite .",
    "this theory is also able to consider colloidal systems at finite volume fractions .",
    "our lbm for charged colloids is well suited to study their short  time dynamics and the flow around macroions .",
    "it is not restricted to steady state problems but one can also determine time dependent quantities like the velocity autocorrelation function of a tagged macroion in a colloidal suspension . also particle shapes which are different from a spherical one can be easily introduced in our lbm . moreover ,",
    "the introduction of walls is rather simple which makes it possible to study charged colloidal particles in confined geometries .",
