    "majorana fermions ( mfs ) have been intensively studied in different condensed matter systems during the last decade @xcite . in partial , these states are interesting due to their exotic properties such as non - abelian statistics , which open the perspective of using them for quantum computing @xcite .",
    "experimental evidences of such states have been reported in semiconducting nanowires with strong rashba spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) brought in the proximity to an @xmath0-wave superconductor ( sc ) @xcite and in magnetic atomic chains on sc substrates @xcite .",
    "in contrast to transport experiments @xcite , where one can only confirm the presence of zero - energy states but not its localized character in real space , the more recent scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments accessed the mf wavefunction showing that the observed zero - energy states are localized at the chain ends @xcite .",
    "however , a systematic numerical study of the full tomography of the mf wavefunction using stm techniques is still missing . in this paper",
    "we focus on the tomography of the mf wave function by modeling stm tips made either of normal or superconducting materials and compare both approaches .",
    "we find that the differential conductance is always position - dependent .",
    "generally , in the weak coupling regime , maximums ( minimums ) in the conductance correspond to maximums ( minimums ) in the local density - of - states ( ldos ) , which allows us to access the mf wavefunction properties such as the localization length and the spatial oscillation period . in the strong coupling regime , the differential conductance saturates and never exceeds the quantized values @xmath1 [ @xmath2 for the superconducting ( normal ) tip at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "if temperature is high , the thermal broadening becomes important , and the maximum conductance is much lower than @xmath3 or @xmath4 as well as in the case when the coupling between the stm tip and the substrate is weak .",
    "we also find two important advantages in using a superconducting over a normal tip .",
    "first , the tunneling rate necessary to get the information on the wave function has to be smaller than for a normal stm tip .",
    "second , the temperature broadening is strongly suppressed .",
    "we finally discuss several effects such as the resolution of the tip compared to the period of the oscillations , and also various model regimes allowing us to control and detect the properties of mf wave functions in the most optimal regime .",
    "our calculations are based on the non - equilibrium green function technique involving the keldysh formalism .",
    "we calculate the bare green function of our substrate which is dressed by the self energy of the tip via a non - perturbative tunneling term @xcite .",
    "next we get the full green function of the system which allows us to derive a general formula for the current and the higher cumulants .",

    ", width=302 ]",
    "first , we explore how the spatial profile of the differential conductance at zero bias depends on the tunneling rate @xmath7 in the case of a normal metallic stm probe , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "importantly , the general feature of the majorana wave function is clearly captured for all values of @xmath7 .",
    "generally , the stronger @xmath7 , the larger is the conductance , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . at lower temperatures ,",
    "the maximum of conductance comes close to @xmath50 @xcite if the tip is connected at the end of the wire where the amplitude of the wave function is maximal and , thus , the coupling between the mf and the tip is the strongest .",
    "however , we note that the value @xmath50 , predicted for transport via mfs is never reached even if we work with wires that are much longer than the mf localization length such that the mfs do not hybridize @xcite . to observe the quantized values , the tunneling should be of the order of the superconducting gap , which is not the regime of a stm spectroscopy experiment , where the tip should not perturb the system to be measured .",
    "the differential conductance also crucially depends on the temperature @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath7 is small compared to @xmath52 , there is a strong effect due to temperature broadening . by decreasing @xmath52",
    ", we get exponentially close to the value @xmath50 for the same set of parameters , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "generally , the smaller the tunneling rate @xmath7 is , the higher is the saturation temperature , see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "it is also more difficult to reach @xmath50 if the tip probes one of the next maximums , where the weight of the mf is smaller . along the same lines ,",
    "the saturation is achieved faster when the wave function is more localized and each of the maximums has more weight .    for small values of @xmath7",
    ", the conductance maps could be used to extract the localization lengths by direct fitting @xcite ( see appendix [ matching ] ) .",
    "in contrast to that , in the strong coupling regime , @xmath53 saturates at the quantized value @xmath50 and the conductance profile does not replicate the ldos profile anymore .",
    "for example , the decay is no longer purely exponential .",
    "however , the main features are still well captured .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , there is a characteristic feature at the site @xmath54 resulting from the interplay of two exponential decays , which can be identified both in the ldos and in the differential conductance maps . at the same time , the period of the mf wave function oscillations , determined by the fermi wavelength , is perfectly captured at all @xmath7 values and in excellent agreement with the period extracted from the ldos .",
    "next , we look at the differential conductance maps obtained with the superconducting tips .",
    "our formalism is valid only around and above @xmath55 and not in the middle of the gap where the andreev reflection plays an important role . in what follows , for numerical convenience",
    ", we put @xmath56 , however , we checked that using larger values of @xmath55 does not affect the results discussed below .     only for the superconducting tip and at a bias @xmath57 .",

    "in contrast to the normal tip data , for large values of @xmath7 , the signal flattens at the wire ends . , width=302 ]     for the first three maximums obtained at @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "in contrast to the normal tip , the quantized value is reached for smaller @xmath7 , compare with fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "again , the saturation level is reached faster at the first maximum . as shown in the inset , where we plot differential conductance for the tip connected to the first site",
    ", the quantized conductance could be reached only at much lower temperatures .",
    "the substrate is in the same configuration as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2].,width=302 ]    similarly to the normal tip , the superconducting tip measurements ( at @xmath57 ) give access to the localization length of mfs and the period of their oscillations in the weak tunneling regime ( small @xmath7 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "however , if @xmath7 is increased the amplitudes of oscillations tend to be smoothened and the maximum of conductance @xmath59 is about to be reached @xcite . in other words , a spatial profile of the differential conductance",
    ", corresponding to the mf wave function , first stays almost constant and then drops abruptly .",
    "we note that even if the tip is connected to the first site , the conductance is only slightly smaller than @xmath3 , for the same reasons as was discussed for the normal lead ( _ i.e. _ finite - size effects , finite temperature , and large tunneling rate ) .",
    "generally , the differential conductance is still position - dependent with the largest signal detected at the mf wave function maximums , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "importantly , the quantized value for the superconducting tip is reached at much smaller values of @xmath7 as it was the case for normal tips .",
    "for example , if the tip is placed above the first maximum , one needs a coupling strength of the order of @xmath60 of the gap size instead of the @xmath61 of the normal metal tip .",
    "as the tunneling strength is increased further , the differential conductance maps start to develop the plateau in the signal at the wire end , so it gets more difficult to read out the oscillation period , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "obviously , the competition between the period of the oscillations and the tip resolution plays an important role here .",
    "indeed , we would still observe the oscillations if their period is larger than the tip size ( one atom in our case ) .",
    "for example , a differential conductance could approach @xmath3 for all the maximums but still be zero in - between , which was never the case for a normal probe , see the appendix [ period_effect ] .",
    "the mf localization length and period of oscillations depend on system parameters and can be tuned by changing , for example , magnetic field or chemical potential .",
    "we also note that the quantized values @xmath3 is reached only at low temperatures , see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] . at higher temperature , the conductance also saturates at some value which depends on @xmath52 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "importantly , we find that the differential conductance always gets exponentially close to this value and this behaviour is independent of the transmission coefficient",
    ". it can be explained by the fact that the temperature broadening is suppressed in a superconducting stm tip in stark contrast to the normal stm tip , where the signal was always strongly affected by temperature effects . here",
    "this is no longer the case , a quantized peak develops even in a weak tunneling regime .     as a function of temperature @xmath52 . the smaller @xmath7 is , the smaller is the achieved saturation value .",
    "all parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4].,width=302 ]    in addition , unlike the detection with a normal tip where the mf is detected symmetrically around zero bias with a certain width depending on parameters of the system such as the tunneling or disorder for instance , the detection with a superconducting tip occurs at @xmath57 as mentioned previously , but the shape of the peaks is no longer symmetric . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] , if the voltage is below @xmath55 there is no current .",
    "when the bias reaches @xmath55 , a current starts to flow between the substrate and the tip resulting in a peak .",
    "if @xmath62 is increased further , the differential conductance decreases smoothly until it reaches small negatives value @xcite .",
    "for further comparison between the two kinds of detection we refer to the appendix [ 3dplots ] .     for the superconducting tip probing at the end of the nanowire .",
    "the maximum of the differential conductance at the bias equal to @xmath55 is close to @xmath3 @xcite.,width=302 ]",
    "we note that our model based on rashba soi and uniform magnetic field is equivalent to the model without any soi but with a spatially rotating magnetic field @xcite produced either externally by local nanomagnets or intrinsically due to rkky interaction between localized magnetic moments@xcite .",
    "thus , our results can be directly applied to the latter systems , for example , to magnetic atom chains on superconducting surfaces @xcite .",
    "we have checked numerically that using such a model does not change any of the results for the differential conductance discussed above . in appendix [ experiments_parameters ] ,",
    "we provide additional simulations of strong and weak soi regimes .",
    "we also note that the stm tips can be also used in a similar way to extract the information about the spatial profile of other than mfs types of bound states , such as fractional fermion states or andreev bound states . @xcite",
    "it is important to point out that the ldos of the substrate is generally affected by the tip . in the case of the normal stm tip and weak tunneling limit",
    ", the ldos is unchanged but the amplitude of the mf wave function gets slightly suppressed as the mf tends to leak out into the normal metal @xcite . for large value of the tunneling amplitude , the tip becomes a part of the substrate . as a result , one mf effectively disappears by extending into the tip but the mf at the opposite end remains unchanged . in the case of superconducting probe ,",
    "the behaviour is essentially the same if the bias between the tip and the substrate is equal or larger than @xmath55 .",
    "we acknowledge helpful discussions with daniel loss .",
    "this work was support by the swiss nsf and nccr qsit .",
    "in fig . [ fig : figa1 ] , we have summarized the main results of our paper where we plot ( a ) the ldos as a function of energy and position as well as the differential conductance as a function of the bias voltage and the position obtained with ( b ) the normal stm tip and ( c ) the superconducting stm tip .",
    "both measurements can be used to reconstruct the mf wave function .",
    "the important difference concerns the heights of the peak in the differential conductance , which are generally more pronounced in the case of the superconducting case for several reasons , as was discussed in the main text .    .",

    "c ) corresponding differential conductance obtained with the superconducting stm tip as a function of bias voltage and position for @xmath63 and @xmath58.,width=188 ]",
    "in this appendix , we calculate the current flowing between the tip and the substrate using the keldysh formalism .",
    "to do so , we need to write down all components of the total green function of the system and the self energy of the tip in the keldysh space . in order to obtain the keldysh components of the self - energy , we need to know all the components of the tip green function in this space .",
    "the retarded green function of the tip is already well known in the literature @xcite .",
    "then , it is pretty straightforward to get the advanced one @xmath64 and the keldysh one @xmath65 using the following expressions @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the standard fermi - dirac distribution function ( note that the temperature dependence enters only here ) . using the expression of the self energy of the main text combined with eqs .",
    "( [ tip_green_1 ] ) and ( [ tip_green_2 ] ) , we are able to get all the components of the self - energy tip in the keldysh space in the case of normal metal @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the unity matrix in the spin space .",
    "the case of superconducting tip is a bit more tricky because of the off - diagonal terms .",
    "however , we are not interested in the andreev reflection processes which can occur inside the gap of the tip but more specifically on what happens close to the gap when @xmath70 .",
    "we can thus set these off - diagonal terms corresponding to the andreev processes to zero @xcite .",
    "hence , we can write down the keldysh components of the superconducting self energy @xmath71 with @xmath72     and @xmath58 .",
    "the substrate is in the following configuration : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath45.,width=302 ]    finally , we can get the components of the total green function using the following expressions @xmath73 where @xmath74 because of the properties of the rotated keldysh basis .",
