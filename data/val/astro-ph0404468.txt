    "revealing the true nature of dark energy ( de ) has become one of the most important tasks in cosmology .",
    "considering the plethora of de models proposed in the literature , a model independent reconstruction of de would be an appealing alternative to testing all models separately .",
    "in two recent papers  @xcite attempts were made by alam to reconstruct the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath0 in a model independent manner , using the latest supernova data  @xcite . in these two papers",
    "a truncated taylor series was used to model the dark energy density @xmath3 .",
    "the results indicate an evolution of @xmath0 , a behaviour they call metamorphosis . from the reported analysis",
    ", it would seem that this is a significant effect prompting for `` exotic '' models for the de .    since other parameterizations  @xcite suggest that the type ia supernova data collected so far are consistent with the simplest de model of all , that of a cosmological constant @xmath1 ( @xmath2 )",
    ", it is important to investigate how such different conclusions can be reached starting from the same sets of data . in this paper",
    "we argue that the method of model independent reconstruction proposed by alam suffers from a number of serious shortcomings . for alternative methods of de reconstruction",
    "see e.g. references  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental requirement on a model independent reconstruction of @xmath0 must be that all de alternatives are treated on an equal footing .",
    "although the method of alam at first sight seems to be capable of an exact reproduction of the equation of state parameter of the cosmological constant , it actually favours evolving @xmath0 .",
    "the confidence contours , describing the level to which the reconstructed @xmath0 is known , exhibit two related problems .",
    "first , contours enclosing regions of high confidence level ( cl ) and high redshift tend to diverge .",
    "second , by construction , the low level cl regions shrink for high redshifts .",
    "in this section we present the basic formulae needed for confronting the model of alam with supernova data .",
    "the ansatz for the dark energy density proposed by alam is a truncated taylor series @xmath4 where @xmath5 . in the following",
    ", we will assume that the universe is flat and dominated by matter and de .",
    "the hubble parameter in such a universe , with the de parametrized as in equation  ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) , is hence given by @xmath6 if the matter density is assumed to be known , only two of the parameters describing the de are independent , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the third parameter is given by the normalization condition , @xmath9 .",
    "the equation of state parameter @xmath10 relates the pressure to the energy density and can be used to characterize an energy species .",
    "the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath0 can be calculated given the hubble parameter and the matter density  @xcite @xmath11 by using the parametrization in equation  ( [ eq : hubble ] ) , @xmath12 can be expressed in terms of the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath14 using the derivative of equation  ( [ eq : hubble ] ) in the derivation of equation  ( [ eq : de_eos ] ) , is however a questionable step . if the parametrization of @xmath15 is incorrect , @xmath16 is likely to be even more erroneous .",
    "the parametrization  ( [ eq : de_eos ] ) is capable of reproducing the equation of state parameter for the cosmological constant ( @xmath2 , @xmath17 ) , and topological defects in the form of cosmic strings ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) and domain walls ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "models of de are tested against observations by deriving distances to type ia supernovae through their measured brightness .",
    "cosmic distances are related through the @xmath22independent luminosity distance @xmath23 to the brightness of a supernova measured in magnitudes @xmath24 where @xmath25 will be treated as a `` nuisance '' parameter in the fitting procedure and the absolute magnitude of a supernova is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "the expression for the @xmath22independent luminosity distance in a flat universe is @xmath27 observed and theoretically predicted magnitudes can thus be compared by means of the equations ( [ eq : mag ] ) and ( [ eq : dl ] ) and the model of the de enters via equation ( [ eq : hubble ] ) .",
    "however , since the integrand in  ( [ eq : dl ] ) has to be real , i.e. @xmath28 , only a part of the @xmath29 parameter plane is allowed .",
    "as long as this condition is fulfilled , the dark energy density can be negative .",
    "in this section we reconstruct the dark energy equation of state parameter by the method proposed by alam .",
    "we have used two sets of supernova data , which will be referred to as the _ small _ and the _ large _ data set .",
    "the _ small _ data set is a combination of supernovae from tonry  @xcite and barris  @xcite , and it is the same set as alam used in reference  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 supernovae in the _ small _ set have low extinction @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "large _ data set is an extension of the _ small _ set with @xmath33 additional high redshift supernovae from riess  @xcite .",
    "a maximum likelihood analysis of the data sets was used to estimate the best fit parameters of the dark energy model . the following negative log ",
    "likelihood function was used @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are observed magnitude and magnitude error of a supernova at redshift @xmath37 .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 , related to the hubble constant and the absolute supernova magnitude , was treated as a `` nuisance '' parameter in the fitting procedure described below .",
    "first , the negative log  likelihood function in equation ( [ eq : l ] ) was computed on a cubic lattice in the parameter space spanned by @xmath39 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "thereafter a gaussian prior @xmath40 , containing information on the matter density , was applied to @xmath41 is not critical for our argument . ] .",
    "the @xmath29 plane containing the minimum of the negative log ",
    "likelihood function was then identified . finally ,",
    "the best fit values and the cl contours in this plane were translated into @xmath0 through equation ( [ eq : de_para ] ) .    the best fit parameters to the _ small _ data set ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) and the @xmath44 and 1@xmath45 cl contours in the parameter plane are shown in panel ( a ) in figure  [ fig : hzt_w ] .",
    "the 1@xmath45 cl contour is drawn in order to facilitate comparison with reference  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "note that alam _",
    "et al _ report their confidence regions as 1@xmath45 levels , i.e. as @xmath46 in their maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "as two parameters are jointly fitted this corresponds only to a @xmath47 cl .",
    "the reconstructed history of the dark energy equation of state parameter , shown in panel ( b ) in figure  [ fig : hzt_w ] , is clearly consistent with a cosmological constant at the @xmath48 , but not at the @xmath49 cl .",
    "there are however some peculiarities of the reconstructed @xmath0 that should be noted .",
    "the @xmath48 and @xmath44 confidence regions drawn in figure  [ fig : hzt_w ] diverge at large redshifts .",
    "this corresponds to the contour regions crossing the dark shaded region in the @xmath29 plane , where @xmath0 grows very rapidly .",
    "the @xmath49 and 1@xmath45 confidence regions , on the other hand , converge at large redshift .",
    "moreover , there is a waist at @xmath50 where all contours are squeezed together .",
    "these peculiarities indicate that this reconstruction is in fact not model independent , as will be further explained in the next section .",
    "figure  [ fig : hzt_16hz ] shows @xmath0 obtained from the _ large _ data set with @xmath33 additional supernovae .",
    "this equation of state parameter is consistent with the cosmological constant even at the @xmath49 cl .",
    "however , the confidence regions still exhibit the same behaviour as the ones obtained for the _ small _ data set .",
    "the unusual behaviour of the results in figure  [ fig : hzt_w ] and  [ fig : hzt_16hz ] appear since the dark energy equation of state parametrization  ( [ eq : de_eos ] ) has a few peculiarities , which we discuss in this section .",
    "the dark energy equation of state parameter will obviously diverge whenever the denominator in equation  ( [ eq : de_eos ] ) vanishes .",
    "regions in the parameter plane where @xmath0 blows up ( @xmath51 ) or diverges somewhere in the redshift interval @xmath52 are shown in dark gray in e.g. panel ( a ) in figure  [ fig : hzt_w ] .",
    "the point @xmath17 , corresponding to the cosmological constant , lies very close to this region .",
    "if the best fit to data is near this point , the error in @xmath0 will blow up .",
    "diverging equation of state parameter is the reason why the @xmath48 confidence region in e.g. figure  [ fig : hzt_w](b ) blows up .",
    "from equation  ( [ eq : de_eos ] ) one can easily see that the parametrized equation of state depends on the order of the taylor expansion at the high redshift limit .",
    "if , for instance , only the first order is considered , @xmath53 for high redshifts , while for the second order @xmath54 . since the proposed ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) is a truncated taylor series we can not expect equation  ( [ eq : de_eos ] ) to be valid at very high redshifts",
    ". however , the effects of these high redshift limits are noticeable already at the moderate redshifts where we try to model de .",
    "these limits are responsible for the shrinkage of the non  diverging confidence regions at high redshift ( e.g. , see the @xmath49 confidence region in figure  [ fig : hzt_w](b ) ) .",
    "the dark energy equation of state parameter described by equation  ( [ eq : de_eos ] ) can be thought of as a family of curves , where each curve is parametrized by @xmath39 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in this section",
    "we study the stability of these curves to perturbations in the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , we will show that some curves in this family become more stable with redshift , with respect to these perturbations , while others become more unstable .",
    "the change @xmath55 in a curve , described by the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 , due to small perturbations @xmath58 and @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 the curve that corresponds to the cosmological constant ( @xmath17 ) becomes increasingly unstable due to perturbations as redshift increases , @xmath61 a curve that starts close to the line @xmath62 will thus departure from this line with increasing redshift .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : de_eos ] ) can also make an exact reproduction of two types of topological defects .",
    "the equation of state of domain walls ( @xmath21 ) grows stable to perturbations in @xmath7 with @xmath63 , but not to perturbations in @xmath8 @xmath64 the curve corresponding to cosmic strings ( @xmath19 ) is stable to perturbations in both @xmath7 and @xmath8 at high redshifts @xmath65 the curves corresponding to topological defects are thus very special . all other curves ( except the one corresponding to the cosmological constant ) approach one of these two curves as redshift increases . the effect of perturbations in @xmath66 and @xmath67 depends on the value of these parameters .",
    "this is in contrast to perturbations of linear parameterizations of @xmath0 , e.g. @xmath68 , which are independent of parameter values . from the above discussion about the stability of @xmath12 with redshift",
    ", we see that the parameterization in equation  ( [ eq : de_eos ] ) treats the cosmological constant unfairly in favour of other de alternatives .      the parametrized equation of state parameter ( [ eq : de_eos ] ) will not only favour , but also `` force '' evolution .",
    "all curves , describing an evolving equation of state parameter , will cross at a certain redshift . at this redshift @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , the numerator and denominator are equal and the dark energy equation of state assumes the value @xmath71 . the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 , obtained by fitting supernova data to the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) ,",
    "are highly correlated and the ratio @xmath72 is thus nearly constant .",
    "the value of this ratio depends on the slope of the cl contours in the @xmath29 plane which in turn is correlated with the assumed prior on the matter density @xmath39 .",
    "this implies that the location of the point @xmath70 is more or less independent of the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 for a given @xmath39 .",
    "the parametrization  ( [ eq : de_eos ] ) of the equation of state parameter thus favours de evolution .",
    "if the reconstructed equation of state at present is less ( larger ) than minus one it must have been larger ( less ) than minus one in the past .",
    "any significant departure from the line @xmath62 will hence force the reconstructed equation of state parameter to cross that line . since most curves will pass through this point , the family of curves will have a waist centered at @xmath73 , where @xmath74 denotes the slope of the cl contours in the @xmath29 plane .",
    "the transition redshift in e.g. figure  [ fig : hzt_w ] is @xmath75 which corresponds to @xmath76 , in good agreement with the slopes of the ellipses in panel ( a ) .",
    "to test the reliability of this way of reconstructing the dark energy we tried to recover a fiducial cosmology from simulated data sets generated using snoc  @xcite , a monte ",
    "carlo simulation package for high  z supernova observations .",
    "we generated @xmath77 data sets , each one consisting of @xmath30 supernovae with the same distribution of redshifts and magnitude errors as the _ small _ data set used in section  [ sec : reconstruction ] .",
    "a flat universe with a cosmological constant @xmath1 and @xmath78 was used as fiducial cosmology .",
    "the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 were fitted to each simulated data set with a fixed value of @xmath39 .    a scatter plot of best fit values to the simulated data sets",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : a1a2sim ] . from this plot",
    "it is clear that the best fit values of the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 are highly correlated , as anticipated in section  [ sec : force ] . of the simulated data sets ,",
    "@xmath79 were found to be consistent with the cosmological constant at the @xmath49 cl .",
    "these are indicated by full circles in the plot .",
    "data sets not consistent with the cosmological constant at the @xmath49 cl , on the other hand , are indicated by open circles .",
    "the best fit to real data obtained in section  [ sec : reconstruction ] is indicated with a star in the expanded figure in figure  [ fig : a1a2sim ] .",
    "the expansion shows a region where simulated data sets have a reconstructed dark energy equation of state parameter similar to the one obtained from real data .",
    "the simulated data sets in this region are inconsistent with the fiducial cosmology at the @xmath49 cl .",
    "figure  [ fig : exmpl_sim ] shows a few examples of @xmath0 reconstructed from simulated data sets .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath0 in panel ( b ) is almost indistinguishable from the one obtained from real data ( see figure  [ fig : hzt_w ] ) .",
    "rapidly evolving equation of state parameters , resembling the behaviour of the result obtained from real data , can thus be obtained from simulated data sets in a @xmath1 cosmology ( @xmath2 ) with the same distributions of redshifts and magnitude errors as the real set .",
    "we also simulated @xmath77 data sets with the same distribution of redshifts and magnitude errors as the _ large _ data set used in section  [ sec : reconstruction ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : a1a2sim_16hz ] shows a scatter plot of the best fit values to these simulations . in this case @xmath80 of the simulated data sets were consistent with the fiducial cosmology on the @xmath49 cl .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : a1a2sim_16hz ] , the @xmath33 additional high redshift supernovae decrease the spread of the best fit values .    to save computational time ,",
    "a simplified fitting procedure was used in the reconstruction of @xmath0 from the simulated data sets , as @xmath81 was kept fixed at the input value .",
    "the value of the matter density affects the slope of the confidence contour . by using a more realistic fitting procedure the spread of the best fit values would increase .",
    "as we have seen above , equation  ( [ eq : de_eos ] ) involves some difficulties associated with the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state parameter .",
    "could an extension of the ansatz overcome these difficulties ?",
    "studies of an arbitrary power series describing the dark energy density might help us to answer this question @xmath82 where @xmath74 can be zero or any positive or negative integer .",
    "perturbations in the parameters @xmath83 will cause a change in @xmath84 that is independent of these parameters @xmath85 a description of the density of dark energy in terms of a power series will thus not favour any particular model .",
    "the equation of state generated by a power series is given by  ( [ eq : w(h ) ] ) @xmath86 if only one coefficient in  ( [ eq : eos_power ] ) is non  zero , @xmath12 assumes a constant value .",
    "the power series parametrization of the equation of state parameter is hence capable of reproducing a whole spectrum of constant @xmath12 separated by @xmath87 @xmath88 the cosmological constant corresponds to @xmath89 .",
    "the high redshift limit for a truncated power series with leading term @xmath90 resembles this spectrum @xmath91 the change in @xmath92 due to any perturbation of the parameters @xmath83 in the neighborhood of the cosmological constant ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) is given by @xmath95 the effect of perturbations in the parameters depends upon the leading term @xmath96 in the power series . if @xmath97 is positive , the change in the equation of state parameter will increase with redshift .",
    "however , if @xmath97 is negative the change will decrease with redshift . in order to discriminate between the cosmological constant and evolving de alternatives",
    ", we have to contrast this behaviour with the curves describing evolution .",
    "the perturbed equation of state parameter corresponding to non ",
    "zero @xmath83 at a high redshift ( @xmath98 ) with the leading term @xmath96 is : @xmath99 the effects of perturbations decrease with redshift if @xmath97 is positive , or increase with redshift if @xmath97 is negative .",
    "this is the very opposite of the behaviour for the case of a cosmological constant .",
    "the instability problem discussed above can thus not be resolved by adding extra terms to the ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) .",
    "the ansatz proposed by alam may be useful for modelling the dark energy density , but its usefulness for revealing the nature of the de seems limited .",
    "the parametrization of the dark energy equation of state parameter based on a truncated taylor series involves a number of severe problems .",
    "evolution is both favoured and forced by this parametrization .",
    "the cosmological constant is thus mistreated by the ansatz proposed in  @xcite .",
    "not even an extension of the ansatz seems to be able to overcome these difficulties .",
    "the equation of state parameter expressed as in equation  ( [ eq : de_eos ] ) also diverges in large regions of the parameter space .",
    "more data , which focus the solutions to the stable regions , may solve this problem .",
    "however , the region close to the point describing a universe with a cosmological constant will be in a disfavoured part of the parameter space",
    ".    the dark energy equation of state parameter reconstructed from the data sets presented in reference  @xcite and  @xcite is inconsistent with the cosmological constant at the @xmath49 confidence level .",
    "simulations show that the rapidly changing behaviour of @xmath0 could also be expected with this ansatz for a @xmath1 universe .",
    "the scatter of the best fit parameters can be reduced if additional data points at high redshift are added to the simulated data sets .",
    "our best fit to real data with @xmath33 additional high redshift supernovae was consistent with the cosmological constant at the @xmath49 confidence level .",
    "we concluded that the suggested `` model independent '' method of reconstructing the dark energy equation of state parameter in @xcite , is in fact model dependent , and that the seemingly striking results are likely to be due to this deficiency .",
