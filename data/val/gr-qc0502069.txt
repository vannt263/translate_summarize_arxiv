    "in this note we discuss the possibility of finding a class of black hole for which the behavior of the temperature as a function of the horizon radius presents a _",
    "double peak _ form .",
    "typically , this particular behavior leads to the presence of a _ plateau _ in the evaporation rate , implying a drastic evaporation for those black holes having sizes which are bounded between the two scales where the peaks are located .",
    "we show that these black holes actually appear as solutions of lovelock theory of gravity coupled to a particular non - linear electrodynamics .",
    "the existence of such a phase behavior is due to the fact that the two models considered here ( namely lovelock theory and hoffman - infeld theory ) represent short distance corrections to both general relativity and maxwell electrodynamics respectively and , consequently , two peaks arise if the scale induced by both corrections do not coincide ( scale splitting ) .    specifically , we study five - dimensional solutions representing charged black holes in hoffmann - infeld electrodynamics within the framework of lovelock theory of gravity .",
    "currently , in a particular context , the study of the combined problem of considering certain models of non - linear ( born - infeld like ) electrodynamics and higher order gravitational theories acquires importance due to the role that these theories play in low energy string inspired models .",
    "originally , hoffmann - infeld model was proposed to avoid certain _ pathological _ features that born - infeld field theory presents when spherically symmetric static solutions are considered , as the conical singularities that bions present at the origin . actually , the modification of born - infeld theory presented in ref .",
    "@xcite has been shown to lead to spherically symmetric particle - like objects whose associated metric is regular everywhere , so avoiding the conical singularity of the einstein - born - infeld case previously studied in ref .",
    ". nevertheless , the black hole solutions in einstein - hoffmann - infeld field theory are still singular since the curvature diverges at the origin .",
    "the explicit form of hoffmann - infeld action is presented in ref .",
    "this can be written as follows @xmath0 with @xmath1 and where @xmath2 represents a characteristic field , analogue to that appearing in born - infeld theory .",
    "actually , hoffmann - infeld model corresponds to logarithmic modifications to a non - linear born - infeld - like lagrangian , and was originally designed in such a way that certain _ regularity conditions _ hold for both gravitational and electric fields when particle - like solutions are considered . in the case of the gravitational field , the regularity condition comes from the choice of an integration constant that amounts to state the identity between gravitational and electromagnetic mass .    on the other hand ,",
    "the short distance corrections carried by higher order theories , as lovelock theory of gravity , automatically held the divergences associated with the newtonian term @xcite .",
    "hence , the finitness of the gravitational field at the origin is guaranteed _",
    "ab initio_. this means that the identification between electromagnetic and gravitational mass in lovelock gravity does not come from imposing the requirement for the metric of the spacetime to be finite but by adding the requirement that no conical singularity should exist there @xcite .    in the following section ,",
    "we describe the charged black hole solutions in five - dimensional lovelock gravity coupled to hoffmann - infeld non - linear electrodynamics . in section 3 , we study the thermodynamics of this solution , with particular interest focused on the evaporation phenomenon .",
    "the most general five - dimensional gravity action that depends on the metric and its derivatives up to the second order and , besides , leads to conserved field equations is the lovelock gravitational action .",
    "this is given by supplementing einstein - hilbert action with gauss - bonnet terms . in lower dimensional models ( @xmath3 )",
    "these terms represent topological invariants and , hence , lovelock gravity turns out to coincide with general relativity . in five dimensions",
    "the action is @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the gauss - bonnet coupling constant , which defines a length scale .",
    "actually , this theory introduces short distance corrections to general relativity , implying the existence of a scale @xmath7 where such corrections turn out to be relevant .",
    "the gravitational equations of motion resulting from @xmath8 are @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the stress - tensor representing the _ matter - field _ distribution coming from the variation @xmath11 .    here , we are interested in static spherically symmetric solutions satisfying the following _ ansatz _ @xmath12 which , once replaced in the field equations , yields @xmath13 then , it is straightforward to prove that the following functional relation holds @xmath14 being @xmath15 a spherically symmetric solution of the field equations with @xmath16 , which is simply determined by solving einstein equations in five dimensions .",
    "the meaning of equation ( [ relation ] ) can be intuitively understood by the following heuristic argument : let us consider the gravitational potential @xmath17 defined as @xmath18 ; then , according to the relation above , the potential can be written as @xmath19 where the _ mass _ @xmath20 is due to the gravitational potential itself and given by @xmath21 .    besides , when the total energy of the source is finite , @xmath22 can be written as @xmath23 this solution amounts the choice of a null integration constant in ( [ equa ] ) ( a possible term @xmath24 has been removed in ( [ op ] ) ) , and implies the identification of gravitational and electromagnetic masses .",
    "the finitness of the total energy guarantees the newtonian behavior at the infinity .",
    "the non - linear electrodynamics with finite total energy are characterized by a field scale @xmath2 defining the typical length scale @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the charge of the object .",
    "we will consider the electromagnetic stress - tensor for a particle - like source as having the generic form @xmath27 in the case of hoffmann - infeld model , the function @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 which corresponds to a charged particle - like source with electric field @xmath30 .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of the born - infeld model the function is @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , in the generic case we will demand the following _ finitness conditions _ : @xmath32 notice that , in the case of hoffmann - infeld model one finds @xmath33 . the first condition in ( [ fin ] ) is the requirement for the metric to be finite when a particle - like solution is considered as the source of einstein gravity theory . on the other hand",
    ", the second condition means that the total energy of the particle turns out to be finite .",
    "the born - infeld charge fulfills both requirements ( hoffmann studied a born - infeld charged black hole in four dimensions , in the context of einstein gravity @xcite ) .",
    "however the born - infeld charge yields @xmath34 , which means that a conical singularity remains in the metric .",
    "hoffmann and infeld removed the conical singularity by modifying the born - infeld electrodynamics in order to obtain @xmath35 @xcite . however , also lovelock gravity remove the conical singularity , as it can be seen in the relation ( [ relation ] ) .",
    "in fact , it results @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "thus , we find that @xmath39 for any finite @xmath40 .",
    "note that this is a charged deser - boulware @xcite black hole .",
    "solution ( [ sol ] ) presents an external horizon located at @xmath41 , with @xmath42 moreover , note that , in the large @xmath43 limit , the following asymptotic behaviour is obtained @xmath44 where @xmath45 and the dots refer to subleading orders in @xmath46 ( and subleading orders in @xmath47 as well ) .",
    "furthermore , if the large @xmath48 limit of the metric is performed , we find @xmath49 once the mass is accordingly identified as @xmath50 .",
    "conversely , if we first take the limit @xmath51 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath52 ) and then explore the asymptotic behavior , the geometry becomes @xmath53 which , for instance , in the case @xmath54 corresponds to a black hole with a dominant cosmological term @xmath55 and a _",
    "wrong sign _ reissner - nordstrm term @xmath56 .",
    "this mimics a charged massless black hole with _ imaginary electric charge _ ; though it has to be emphasized that the mechanism leading to such a metric is substantially different to the one leading to black holes with an analogous _ tidal charge _",
    "term , cf .",
    "it is relatively simple to verify that , considering subleading effects in powers of @xmath47 , the mass of ( [ sol ] ) is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 and where the _ dressing _ of the newtonian term manifestly appears due to the presence of the cosmological constant @xmath59 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this dressing effect is characterized by the expansion in powers of the dimensionless parameter @xmath60 . moreover",
    ", the specific value of the first term in such expansion is the one required for the metric to be regular at @xmath61 .    on the other hand , for the specific value @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) ,",
    "the solution takes a rather different form ;    namely @xmath65 with the function @xmath66     [ @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 ] .,width=340 ]     for both hoffmann - infeld ( hi ) and born - infeld ( bi ) solutions [ @xmath70 , @xmath68 , @xmath69].,width=340 ]    this metric corresponds to an asymptotically anti - de sitter space in five dimensions .",
    "this is due to the finite value @xmath72 at infinity .",
    "geometries ( [ tenuza ] ) present event horizons and are closely related to the black hole solutions of chern - simons gravitational theory .",
    "in particular , for the lovelock - hoffmann - infeld black hole , the function @xmath28 clearly satisfies the finitness conditions described above . in this case , the charged black hole solution ( [ sol ] ) shares several properties with the one built for the born - infeld model , _",
    "e.g. _ the existence of charged black holes with a unique horizon .",
    "however , the horizon structure of both theories is certainly different ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig9 ] and the analogue presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , _ e.g.",
    "_ the fact that the internal radius @xmath73 decreases when the mass @xmath74 increases ( for a fixed charge @xmath26 ) is strongly more evident for the case of hoffmann - infeld black hole .",
    "moreover , by comparing the solution ( [ sol ] ) and the one corresponding to the lovelock - born - infeld black holes @xcite , it is feasible to verify that in both theories @xmath75 can be set to @xmath76 at the origin @xmath61 .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of lovelock - hoffmann - infeld solutions , we find that @xmath77 vanishes in the limit @xmath78 whereas it goes to @xmath79 for lovelock - born - infeld black holes ( see fig .",
    "[ origen ] which manifests the difference between both solutions at the origin ) .",
    "this is because the short distance corrections to maxwell theory involved in hoffmann - infeld are , in some sense , stronger than the ones corresponding to born - infeld model .",
    "now , the question arises as to what are the thermodynamical properties of this charged black hole solution .",
    "certainly , it is known that black holes in lovelock gravity present special features which are not shared with their analogues in einstein gravity theory ; namely , these black holes typically have an infinite lifetime , present a positive specific heat for small radii , their isotermal graphs for the charged cases turn out to be rather different @xcite , violate the bekenstein s area formula @xcite and the temperature formula in the general case presents an additional term which identically vanishes for @xmath80 . here",
    ", we show that , besides these remarkable aspects , the lovelock - hoffmann - infeld black holes present a _ plateau _ in the evaporation rate as a function of the horizon radius @xmath81 .",
    "this aspect implies that the solutions charged under the hoffmann - infeld electrodynamics evaporate drastically when they have middle sizes within the range of scales where the specific heat is negative .",
    "eventually , these black holes end up in a stable phase ( region of positive specific heat ) and their lifetimes result infinite .",
    "this can be intuitively inferred from the fact that the caloric curve presents a double peak form for certain tunning of the parameters .",
    "let us begin by writting down the temperature for the case of vanishing cosmological constant ; namely @xmath82 whose typical form is described in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] and [ temp3 ] .",
    "the expression above corresponds to the temperature of solution ( [ sol ] ) with @xmath83 and @xmath84 ; this solution is asymptotically flat , as it can be verified by means of the expansion ( [ solas47 ] ) .",
    "actually , the regime of general relativity is recovered in the limit @xmath85 , where the expression for the temperature takes the form @xmath86 .",
    "we also notice that the specific heat changes its sign due to the short distance corrections imposed by both lovelock and hoffmann - infeld models .",
    "the sign of the specific heat enables one to infer which are the regions of thermodynamical stability ( where the black hole can be in thermal equilibrium with the enviroment ) .",
    "consequently , the evaporation rate of these charged solutions is obtained from ( [ t ] ) by integrating over the energy flux .",
    "this is done by making use of the stefan - boltzmann law in five dimensions ; namely @xmath87 , being @xmath88 the surface energy density ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "then , by using that the ( three - dimensional ) surface of the horizon is given by @xmath90 and the expression of the temperature is given by ( [ t ] ) we can integrate over the black hole size in order to obtain the evaporation time @xmath91 where ( [ pungas ] ) was also taken into account .",
    "this corresponds to the time required for a black hole to evaporate , starting with the initial size @xmath92 and ending with a size @xmath81 .",
    "notice that @xmath81 is a monotonic function of the mass ( energy ) @xmath74 .",
    "the symbol @xmath93 stands in the formula above because of the presence of a positive multiplicative constant which is given in terms of the ( inverse of ) stefan - boltzmann constant in five dimensions .",
    "this result leads to observe the presence of the _ plateau _ which is studied in fig .",
    "[ tiempo ] , showing a rapid transition between the two scales where the first maximum and the local minumum of fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] are located .",
    "( for instance , cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the caloric curve obtained here is reminiscent of that . ]",
    "the evaporation rate is usually displayed by analyzing the quantity @xmath94 ; let us notice that the figure [ temp3 ] ( showing the time @xmath95 required to reach a size @xmath81 ) basically gives the same information : this is because the _ plateau _ of the graph precisely corresponds to those scales for which the transition ( evaporation ) is abrupt and , hence , the quantity @xmath94 would present a peak precisely located in that region .",
    "moreover , since we are interested in studying the scales where such an abrupt transition occurs , we find figure [ temp3 ] convenient because it manifestly shows those scales within which such a drastic effect takes place .     as a function of the final radius @xmath81 [ @xmath96 , @xmath68 , @xmath97 .",
    "a _ plateau _ manifestly appears in the evaporation rate .",
    "the graph has been normalized by means of an appropriate redefinition of the stefan - boltzmann constant.,width=340 ]    an interesting analysis of the black hole thermodynamics in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity and chern - simons gravity was recently performed in references @xcite . to make contact with the chern - simons gravity ,",
    "let us consider again the case @xmath98 , for which the formula of the temperature as a function of the horizon radius @xmath81 acquires a dominant linear term ; namely @xmath99 this diverges in the limit @xmath100 .    summarizing , lovelock theory of gravity in higher dimensions introduces short distance corrections to general relativity due to gauss - bonnet terms which , in addition to einstein - hilbert action , have to be taken into account in the most general theory of gravity .",
    "these terms , corresponding to lanczos quadratic gravity for @xmath80 , are such that the mentioned short distance effects imply substantial differences with respect to the black hole thermodynamics of general relativity ; these were listed above .",
    "in addition , we discussed here how the charged black holes in lovelock five dimensional gravity coupled to non - linear hoffmann - infeld electrodynamics present other interesting features like the existence of the double peak profile in the caloric curve , leading to a particular evaporation effect for which two different thermodynamically stable regions do exist .",
    "the black holes evaporate drastically for certain sizes that are bounded by two critical radii ; this region corresponds to the one where the specific heat is negative .",
    "eventually , a final phase is reached and the black holes become eternal ; the explicit computation of the evaporation rate leads to an infinite lifetime as result . because of the particular profile of the caloric curve , the evaporation phenomenon described here is qualitatively different to the one corresponding to the five - dimensional lovelock - born - infeld solutions , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of the static spherically symmetric solution presented in this note is general enough as to be suitable for adaptation to the case of lovelock black holes charged under a quite generic model of non - linear electrodynamics .",
    "in particular , it would be relatively easy to extend it to those models of electrodynamics leading to regular black holes in einstein gravity @xcite .",
    "the analysis of these geometries within the framework of lovelock gravity could be an interesting subject for further study .    before concluding ,",
    "let us make brief remark on the higher dimensional case .",
    "certainly , the five - dimensional case presents a special feature : the fact that expression for the temperature ( [ t ] ) acquires an additional term in @xmath101 dimensions , which is proportional to @xmath102 .",
    "this is precisely why previous papers of the subject ( see for instance @xcite ) considered the case @xmath80 as an special one .",
    "however , it is also true that , besides of that , several qualitative aspects of the termodynamics of the @xmath103 lovelock black holes are shared with their higher dimensional analogues : for instance , this is the case of the change of the sign of the specific heat at short distances and the existence of infinite lifetime remnants .",
    "then , similar features to those analyzed in this paper are expected to be valid in the @xmath101-dimensional lovelock - hoffmann - infeld black holes .",
