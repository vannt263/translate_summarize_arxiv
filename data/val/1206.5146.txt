    "because of advances in the field of bose - einstein condensation , solitary waves have received considerable attention in atomic physics during the past 15 years @xcite . in particular , many studies have examined a mean - field description of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) using the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation .",
    "the gp equation includes a cubic nonlinearity , with a strength proportional to the @xmath0-wave scattering length , which arises from the interatomic interactions .",
    "this mean - field description has been important for theoretical and experiment investigations of phenomena such as bright solitary waves @xcite , dark solitary waves @xcite , gap solitary waves @xcite , multi - component solitary waves @xcite , and faraday waves @xcite .",
    "solitary waves have been studied in great detail in the presence of various external potentials , including linear periodic lattices ( so - called  optical lattices \" ) and harmonic traps .",
    "this has yielded tremendous insights into a large variety of phenomena , including bloch oscillations , landau - zener tunneling , modulational (  dynamical \" ) instabilities and gap excitations , and more @xcite .",
    "numerous techniques have been developed that enable the control and manipulation of coherent states in becs .",
    "these include static ( homogeneous and inhomogeneous ) electric and magnetic fields @xcite , optical devices @xcite , and near - field radio - frequency devices @xcite .",
    "one can vary a bec s external ( trapping ) potential while independently and simultaneously changing the strength of the nonlinearity by tuning interatomic interactions .",
    "the interaction among the atoms can be adjusted experimentally over a very broad range by employing either magnetic @xcite or optical feshbach resonances @xcite , and the manipulation of becs using feshbach resonances has led to numerous insights .",
    "experimental achievements include the formation of bright solitary waves and solitary - wave trains for @xmath1li @xcite and @xmath2rb @xcite atoms by tuning the interatomic interaction within a stable bec from repulsive to attractive , the formation of molecular condensates @xcite , and the probing of the bec - bcs crossover @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies include the prediction that a time - dependent modulation of the scattering length can be used to stabilize attractive two - dimensional ( 2d ) becs against collapse @xcite or to create robust matter - wave breathers in 1d becs @xcite .",
    "temporal modulation of the gp equation s nonlinearity and its impact on collapse properties and on other nonlinear phenomena ( such as modulational instabilities ) have been examined systematically in nonlinear optics  @xcite .",
    "atomic matter waves also exhibit novel features under the influence of a spatially varying scattering length , which yields a spatially - dependent nonlinearity coefficient in the gp equation .",
    "numerous works have considered matter - wave dynamics in such `` collisionally inhomogeneous '' environments .",
    "theoretical predictions include adiabatic compression of matter waves @xcite , enhancement of the transmitivity of matter waves through barriers @xcite , dynamical trapping of solitary waves @xcite , and a delocalization transition of matter waves @xcite .",
    "linear @xcite , parabolic @xcite , random @xcite , periodic ( i.e. , nonlinear lattices ) @xcite , and localized ( step - like ) @xcite inhomogeneities have all been considered .",
    "there have also been several detailed mathematical studies @xcite as well as examinations of analogous situations in optics @xcite .",
    "additionally , the interplay between linear and nonlinear lattices has been examined in both continuum @xcite and discrete @xcite settings .",
    "two important recent developments on becs in collisionally inhomogeneous environments include a broad review of relevant theoretical activity @xcite and the experimental creation of a spatially periodic effective nonlinearity in a yb bec @xcite .    in this paper , which is motivated in part by the recent experimental work of ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider spatially periodic scattering lengths that can be tuned using feshbach resonances from small - amplitude , approximately sinusoidal structures to a periodic sequence of densely - spaced spikes .",
    "we consider  aligned \" and  anti - aligned \" periodic structures and compare and contrast the solitary - wave dynamics for each case .",
    "we first consider situations in which collisional inhomogeneities are always present ( i.e. , in which the coefficient of the nonlinearity is time - independent ) before moving on to ones in which they are turned on either adiabatically or abruptly .    when considering time - independent inhomogeneities , we employ both direct numerical simulations of the gp equation and a bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) analysis to examine the linear stability of dark solitary waves .",
    "we thereby identify two distinct mechanisms of instability for the dark solitary waves  an exponential one and an oscillatory one  and we examine when each of these arises .",
    "importantly , we find and quantify a change of instability mechanism as one switches between wide - well and narrow - well lattices .",
    "when switching on inhomogeneities in time , we find for aligned lattices that the dark solitary waves are generically robust , but that additional excitations in the form of gray solitary waves also emerge ( especially when the inhomogeneities are turned on nonadiabatically ) .",
    "we briefly examine the time scales for the onset of solitary - wave oscillations in this scenario .",
    "the rest of our presentation is organized as follows . in section [ setup ] , we present the gp equation and our setup of spatially periodic scattering lengths .",
    "we consider time - independent scattering lengths and discuss the dark solitary waves arising in this situation in section [ dark ] .",
    "we then consider the dynamical response of switching on the collisional inhomogeneities in section [ response ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ conclusion ] and present some directions for future work .",
    "the dynamics of a cigar - shaped bec can be approximated in the mean field by the quasi-1d gp equation @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the macroscopic wave function , @xmath5 is the chemical potential , satisfies the quasi-1d gp equation without the need to write the chemical potential @xmath5 explicitly in the equation . ]",
    "@xmath6 is an external potential , and @xmath7 is a ( suitably normalized ) spatially and temporally modulated coefficient .",
    "we suppose that the bec is in a harmonic trap , so @xmath8 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : basicgp ] ) , we have rescaled the condensate density in units of @xmath9 , length in units of @xmath10 , time in units of @xmath11 , and energy in units of @xmath12 .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 is the axial oscillator length , @xmath14 is planck s constant , @xmath15 is the mass of an atom in the bec , and @xmath16 is the axial trap frequency .",
    "additionally , @xmath17 is the dimensional nonlinearity coefficient , where @xmath18 is the @xmath0-wave scattering length and we have averaged over the transverse directions ( assuming a ground - state wave profile ) @xcite .",
    "we choose @xmath19 for convenience .",
    "we consider a @xmath20rb bec as an example and consequently use the parameter values @xmath21 m , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .    in our calculations , the nondimensional numbers of atoms @xmath24 is roughly @xmath25 .",
    "the number of atoms @xmath26^{1/2 } / |q| ) n$ ] is thus roughly @xmath27 , though the phenomena that we observe are robust over different values of @xmath28 .",
    "the two criteria for the quasi-1d regime are satisfied @xcite : ( 1 ) the trap is highly anisotropic , as @xmath29 ; and ( 2 ) the parameter @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the oscillator length in the radial direction",
    ".    the normalized coefficient @xmath32 can be either positive or negative .",
    "the sign of @xmath33 depends on the atomic species ; repulsive interatomic interactions yield @xmath34 , and attractive ones yield @xmath35 .",
    "the sign and magnitude of @xmath33 can both be changed using feshbach resonances , which make it possible ( in principle ) to manipulate the sign and strength of atomic interactions @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to vary the scattering length and consequently the nonlinearity coefficient @xmath33 in space and time by tuning an external field in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance . as we noted previously , spatial variation of the @xmath0-wave scattering length using feshbach resonances",
    "was recently demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "temporal variations of bec scattering lengths using feshbach resonances have been studied for more than 10 years .    in this paper",
    ", we consider repulsive becs with a spatially periodic nonlinearity coefficient @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that the nonlinearity does not change sign .",
    "we start by considering time - independent @xmath0-wave scattering lengths , for which @xmath37 .",
    "we consider the experimentally realistic @xcite functional form @xmath38 where the wavenumber @xmath39 determines the wavelength of the nonlinear lattice @xmath40 , the parameter @xmath41 ( by normalization ) , and @xmath42 .",
    "we let @xmath43 $ ] , and we use @xmath44 $ ] so that @xmath45 is always finite . in our numerical simulations , we consider wavenumbers @xmath46 $ ] .    the parameter @xmath47 determines the magnitude of the spatial modulation of @xmath40 , and the parameter @xmath48 determines the shape of the lattice , which is approximately sinusoidal when @xmath49 and resembles a periodic train of thin spikes as @xmath50 .",
    "we avoid a singularity in @xmath40 by bounding @xmath48 away from @xmath51 .",
    "the angle @xmath52 is a constant and determines a shift in alignment between the nonlinear lattice and the harmonic potential @xmath53 .",
    "we consider two situations : ( 1 ) _ aligned _ nonlinear lattices , for which @xmath54 , so the minimum of the harmonic potential @xmath53 ( which is located at @xmath55 ) coincides with a minimum of @xmath40 ; and ( 2 ) _ anti - aligned _ lattices , for which @xmath56 , so the minimum of the harmonic trap coincides with a maximum of @xmath40 . as we discuss later , the stability properties of solitary waves differ in the two cases .    in the sections below , we examine the existence , stability , and dynamics of dark solitary waves as the strength and shape of the nonlinear lattice @xmath40 is varied .",
    "we establish existence by finding standing - wave solutions @xmath57 , for which the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : basicgp ] ) vanishes .",
    "we then examine the stability of these solutions via linearization around @xmath58 .",
    "in other words , we perform a bdg analysis : we consider an @xmath59 correction to the gp equation ( [ eq : basicgp ] ) by writing @xmath60\\,,\\ ] ] where the asterisk @xmath61 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "we examine the dynamics of the standing wave by perturbing it and computing its temporal evolution using eq .",
    "( [ eq : basicgp ] ) .",
    "we then study the response of solitary waves to both gradual ( adiabatic ) and abrupt ( nonadiabatic ) changes of the atomic interactions .",
    "both types of changes can , in principle , be introduced experimentally using a feshbach resonance .",
    "as we will discuss in this section , the stability of the observed dark solitary waves depends on the parameter values of the nonlinear lattice . in figs .",
    "[ numerics_ds ] and [ numerics_ds2 ] , we show the dynamics for several situations in aligned and anti - aligned lattices .",
    "we show solitary - wave solutions of the stationary gp equation ( obtained via newton iteration ) in the top panels , where we also display the nonlinear lattice and the harmonic trap .",
    "the dip in the wavefunctions near @xmath55 helps illustrate that these are in fact dark solitary waves .",
    "we show their corresponding eigenfrequencies ( computed using the bdg equations ) in the middle panels , and we show the temporal evolution of the solitary waves using direct numerical simulations of the time - dependent gp equation ( [ eq : basicgp ] ) in the bottom panels .",
    "we observed two qualitatively distinct situations for both aligned and anti - aligned nonlinear lattices : unstable dark solitary waves with one pair of purely imaginary eigenfrequencies and unstable dark solitary waves with a quartet of complex eigenfrequencies . as the value of the wavenumber @xmath39 increases , the solution in the aligned lattice undergoes a transition from windows of mild oscillatory instabilities , which are indicated by quartets of complex eigenfrequencies that result from hamiltonian - hopf bifurcations , to strong instabilities , which are indicated by purely imaginary frequencies that result from crossing the origin of the spectral plane .",
    "interestingly , we observe the opposite dependence on @xmath39 in the anti - aligned lattice .",
    "we illustrate these small-@xmath39 ( left panels ) and large-@xmath39 ( right panels ) results for aligned lattices in fig .",
    "[ numerics_ds ] and for anti - aligned lattices in fig .",
    "[ numerics_ds2 ] .",
    "the dichotomy between the dynamics for aligned and anti - aligned lattices indicates that , given a fixed set of parameter values , one can in principle shift the nonlinear lattice ( or , equivalently , the magnetic trap ) and control the strength of the instability of a dark solitary wave .",
    "this makes it possible to transition between a regime of strong instability and a regime of alternating windows of weak instability . from the spatio - temporal evolution of the dark solitary waves , which we illustrate in the bottom panels , we observe in both cases",
    "that the waves ultimately become displaced from the center and oscillate between two turning points in the parabolically trapped bec . in the small-@xmath39 regime , the strong interaction of the propagating dark solitary - wave structures leads to their eventual decay after only a few oscillations .",
    "when @xmath39 is large , however , the bec appears to reach a `` homogenized '' limit that is characterized by a reduced range of spatial variation ( due to the nonlinear lattice ) within the trap .",
    "ultimately , as @xmath39 increases further , the role of the nonlinear lattice is to yield an effective averaged modulation of the @xmath0-wave scattering length .",
