    "the section of the galaxy beyond the solar circle in the first quadrant is arguably the most difficult in which to study galactic structure .",
    "heliocentric distances are large ( e.g. , @xcite ) , population  i objects scarce , the rotation curve poorly constrained , and the disk warped and flared .",
    "still , two well - defined spiral arms are easily recognized in large - scale 21  cm and co surveys of the region ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also our figure  [ fig4 ] below ) .",
    "the nearer one , the perseus arm , straddles the solar circle in the first quadrant , apparently crossing it near a longitude of @xmath3 ; the other is 23 kpc farther from the galactic center and is generally called the outer arm ( although other names such as `` cygnus - outer '' , `` norma - cygnus '' , and `` perseus+i '' have been applied ; @xcite ) .",
    "we note in passing that an even more distant arm was recently identified in both 21  cm and co emissions in the first quadrant @xcite ; at about 15  kpc from the galactic center this may be the distant end of the scutum - centaurus arm .",
    "in general , the outer arm contains much less molecular gas than arms at smaller galactic radii ( e.g. , perseus ) .",
    "even so , some star - forming regions are detected in the arm at distances of @xmath4  kpc toward the anticenter direction , and this section of the arm has been located by trigonometric parallaxes @xcite , through kinematic distance estimates ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and via photometric observations of open clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an accurate knowledge of the gas distribution and large - scale motions in the outer regions of the galaxy may provide strong constraints on the rotation curve of the milky way . in this respect , trigonometric parallax measurements of high - mass star - forming regions ( hmsfrs ) yield both an accurate distance to the source ( within 10% accuracy ) and its full - space proper motion around the galaxy ( within a few km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "so far , these observations have provided evidence for a nearly flat rotation curve up to about 13  kpc from the galactic center in both the third @xcite and second galactic quadrants @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we further constrain the outer - galaxy rotation curve and the structure of the outer arm in the first quadrant using masers associated with the hmsfr ( iras  201444 + 3726 ) . the longitude and large negative local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity of this region , @xmath5  km s@xmath1 ,",
    "place it within the locus of the outer arm as traced by the gas .",
    "we conducted multi - epoch , astrometric , very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations of its 22  ghz water masers ( @xmath6  jy ; @xcite ) in order to measure the trigonometric parallax and 3-dimensional velocity vectors of this star - forming region .",
    "we conducted vlba observations to study the @xmath7 h@xmath8o maser emission ( rest frequency 22.235079  ghz ) toward the hmsfr . in order to measure the trigonometric ( annual ) parallax and galactic proper motion of this source , we used phase - referencing observations by fast switching between the maser target and two extragalactic continuum sources , j2015 + 3710 and j2018 + 3812 .",
    "the former one was found in the vcs2 survey and has an absolute position known to better than @xmath9  mas @xcite , whereas the latter belongs to the vera 22  ghz fringe search survey ( @xcite ; see figure  [ calib ] ) . two strong fringe - finders ( 3c345 and 3c454.3 )",
    "were observed for bandpass , single - band delay , and instrumental phase - offset calibration .",
    "we also employed four blocks of geodetic - like observations , in order to remove total atmospheric delays for each antenna @xcite .",
    "detailed source information is summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .    at first",
    ", we carried out a preparatory survey with the vla in bna - configuration under program bm272 on 2007 october 5 , in order to determine the maser position with sub - arcsecond accuracy .",
    "the vlba observations were scheduled under program bm272h at four epochs : 2008 november 10 , 2009 may 6 , 13 , and november 13 .",
    "these dates were optimized to sample the yearly peaks of the right - ascension parallax sinusoid and at the same time remove all correlation among the parallax and proper motion parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we employed four adjacent intermediate frequency ( if ) bands , each 8 mhz wide , in dual circular polarization ; each band was correlated to produce 256 spectral channels .",
    "the bandwidth was wide enough to detect even weak continuum sources ( a few  mjy beam@xmath1 ) and the channel width of 0.42  km s@xmath1  was narrow enough to resolve well the masers line s spectral components .",
    "the third if band was centered on an lsr velocity ( v@xmath10 ) of 56.0  km s@xmath1 , covering the range of previously detected water maser emission @xcite , whereas the remaining three ifs were spaced by 108  km s@xmath1  each one from the other .",
    "the data were processed with the vlba correlation facility in socorro ( new mexico ) using an averaging time of about 0.9  s , which limited the instantaneous field of view of the interferometer to about @xmath11 ( i.e. without significant amplitude losses ) .",
    "data were reduced with the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) following the procedure described in @xcite . a total - power spectrum of the 22.2  ghz masers toward g75.30 + 1.32  is shown in figure  [ spectrum ] .",
    "we mapped a range of lsr velocities within @xmath12  km s@xmath1  about the mean velocity of the emission ( @xmath13  km s@xmath1 ) and a field of view of @xmath14 about the peak position of the reference feature no .  2 ( see table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "since g75.30 + 1.32  has not been well studied in the past , we imaged a large field - of - view and checked for differences between the total - power spectrum ( figure  [ spectrum ] ) and the flux density from the detected maser features ( table  [ tab3 ] ) . with the interferometer",
    ", we recovered more than @xmath15 of the emission detected with single - dish measurements .",
    "in addition to the emission reported in table  [ tab3 ] , we found a strong , maser line at about @xmath16  km s@xmath1 in the spectra of the second and third epochs .",
    "this emission came from about @xmath17 northward of the reference feature and probably represents another forming star in the region .",
    "however , analysis of this source is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we identified 38 distinct water maser features , distributed within an area of about @xmath18 .",
    "we use the term _ feature _ to refer to multiple `` spots '' spatially overlapping in contiguous velocity channels and identify features with individual masing cloudlets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we used the aips task jmfit to fit an elliptical gaussian brightness distribution to the brightness structure of each maser emission center at each epoch .",
    "the measured properties of individual features are presented in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "their intensities range from about 10 to 0.1  jy  beam@xmath1 and span lsr velocities from @xmath19  km s@xmath1  for the most redshifted feature ( no .",
    "17 ) to @xmath20  km s@xmath1  for the most blueshifted one ( no .",
    "one - third of the maser features persisted over the 1  year time - baseline of our observations . for features lasting at least 6 months , we modeled their relative position shifts with time by a linear fit to get the internal proper motions of the maser distribution . at a distance of 9.25",
    "kpc , the magnitude of the relative motions with respect to feature no .  2 ranges from 4  km",
    "s@xmath1  for feature no .",
    "6 to 84  km s@xmath1  for feature no .  34 , with an average accuracy of about 2  km s@xmath1",
    ".      we measured the parallax and proper motion of the masers relative to the two qsos by differencing their positions over time ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "for the purposes of a maser reference position , we used the spot at @xmath21  km s@xmath1  associated with feature no .",
    "5 ( in table  [ tab3 ] , it is reported the peak lsr velocity for each feature ) .",
    "this spot was isolated , nearly point - like , and fairly strong at all epochs ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] and figure  [ parallax ] show the results of the parallax and proper motion fitting for both background sources .    since systematic errors usually dominate over random noise , we estimated `` a posteriori '' the quality of the measurements from the fit residuals ( see @xcite ) . while both calibrators had a small angular distance from the maser source ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , j2018",
    "+ 3812 had a deconvolved size ( e.g. , @xmath23 at @xmath24 , from the first epoch data ) more than two times that of j2015 + 3710 . that affected the parallax signature in the north direction for the fainter calibrator j2018 + 3812 .",
    "thus , to optimally combine the measurements of the two background sources , we determined their relative weights as follow .",
    "first , we fitted data for each background source separately to give preliminary estimates of parallax and proper motion . since we expect no detectable proper motion for the extragalactic sources , we re - fitted the data from the two sources independently , holding the proper motions fixed at the average values from the first fit .",
    "this procedure was iterated , adjusting the individual error floors to yield values of chi - squared per degree of freedom near unity .",
    "the error - floors determined in this manner were @xmath25  mas in both the e  w and n  s directions for j2015 + 3710 and @xmath26  mas in the e  w direction and @xmath27  mas in the n  s direction for j2018 + 3812 .",
    "these individual error floors were used in a final `` combined ''",
    "parallax reported in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "note that , since the targets of these observations were high - declination sources , we avoided low - elevation data . that explains the accurate n ",
    "s offset measurements for the point - like calibrator j2015 + 3710 , compared to low - declination sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the parallax of g75.30 + 1.32  from the combined fit is @xmath28  mas , corresponding to a distance of @xmath0  kpc from the sun .",
    "for the iau value of the distance to the galactic center , r@xmath29  kpc , our measured distance translates to a galactocentric radius of 10.8  kpc .    to determine a secular proper motion for the hmsfr ( as opposed to a single maser spot ) , we need to correct the combined fit values in table  [ tab2 ] for the proper motion of the reference spot with respect to the forming star .",
    "we estimated this contribution from the average proper motion of all the maser features with respect to the reference spot of the parallax .",
    "the average internal velocity components are @xmath30  mas  yr@xmath1 toward the east and @xmath31  mas  yr@xmath1 toward the north , where we report the standard error of the mean .",
    "thus , the total motion of the whole source is estimated to be @xmath32  mas  yr@xmath1 and @xmath33  mas  yr@xmath1 in the east and north directions , respectively . at our measured distance",
    "these values correspond to @xmath34  km s@xmath1  and @xmath35  km s@xmath1  eastward and northward , respectively . completing the kinematic information , we have assumed an lsr velocity of @xmath36  km s@xmath1  for the hmsfr g75.30 + 1.32 , obtained from the cs(2@xmath371 ) line survey by @xcite , in agreement with the median velocity of the maser features ( @xmath38  km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "we can transform the 3-dimensional velocity from the equatorial heliocentric reference frame , in which they were measured , to a reference frame rotating with the galaxy , to estimate the peculiar motion of the hmsfr ( i.e. the deviation from a circular rotation ) . adopting a flat rotation curve for the milky way with @xmath39  km s@xmath1  @xcite , a current `` best - estimate '' for the distance to the galactic center of r@xmath40  kpc @xcite , and the revised _",
    "_ measurements of the solar motion @xcite , we find peculiar velocity components for g75.30 + 1.32  of @xmath41  km s@xmath1 , where u@xmath42 , v@xmath42 and w@xmath42 are directed toward the galactic center , in the direction of galactic rotation and toward the north galactic pole , respectively . in table",
    "[ outer ] , we summarize these results together with the peculiar proper motions of sources previously measured along the outer arm .",
    "the source g75.30 + 1.32  is located in the first galactic quadrant at a galactocentric radius of about 11  kpc , far beyond the galactocentric radius of the perseus arm in this direction ( @xmath43  kpc ; lower right panel in figure  [ fig4 ] ) . the outer arm between galactic longitudes of @xmath44 at zero latitude",
    "can be clearly traced in 21  cm  emission with @xmath45  km s@xmath1  ( upper panel of figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the longitude - velocity diagram in figure  [ fig4 ] shows that g75.30 + 1.32  ( marked by a cross ) is definitely within the locus of the outer arm , although it lies about 10 km s@xmath1  higher in velocity than the central velocity of the arm at that longitude ( @xmath46  km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "we note that , with a galactic latitude of @xmath47 and a distance of 9.25  kpc , g75.30 + 1.32  is located @xmath48  pc above the galactic plane .",
    "an analysis of both the co survey from @xcite and the  survey from @xcite toward the galactic latitude of g75.30 + 1.32  shows that the star - forming region sits on the side of a fairly bright co cloud and lies close to a substantial  enhancement ( lower left panel in figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "a further comparison of the galactic coordinates and distance of g75.30 + 1.32  with a vertical cross - section of the galactic plane points out the coincidence with a prominent warp of the milky way , particularly pronounced in the neutral hydrogen gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the galactic warp is a displacement of the outer disk from the midplane , generally upward ( toward the north galactic pole ) between the first and second quadrants and downward at diametrically opposite directions in the third and fourth .",
    "this midplane displacement can be also detected in faint co line emission and peaks close to the galactic location of g75.30 + 1.32 , at a galactocentric azimuth @xmath49 , toward the north galactic pole ( e.g. , @xcite , their figure  8) .",
    "the galactocentric azimuth is defined as the azimuth angle around the rotation axis of the galaxy , taken so that @xmath50 points to the sun and @xmath51 is parallel to @xmath52 .",
    "the difference of @xmath53 at @xmath54 and @xmath55 may be related to the dynamics of the warp together with the peculiar motion of g75.30 + 1.32perpendicular to the plane ( @xmath56  km s@xmath1 ) and directed toward the galactic plane .",
    "we note that this last value differs by about six times the mean value for hmsfrs located within the perseus arm ( @xmath57  km s@xmath1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "two ideas have been forwarded to explain the galactic warp ( see @xcite and reference therein ) : 1 ) as a consequence of the ongoing accretion of matter by the galactic halo at much larger radii than the edge of the disk and 2 ) as a result of tidal interactions due to the proximity of the magellanic clouds ( @xmath58 ) and the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( e.g. , figure  1 in @xcite ) . in the accretion scenario , gravitational torques between the inner halo and the outer disk produce a misalignment of the outer parts of the galaxy with respect to the plane of the inner disk .",
    "this happens because of a redistribution of angular momentum through the system as long as freshly accreted matter streams from the outer to the inner parts of the galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this framework",
    ", the present result ( @xmath59 ) may be interpreted as an inward motion through the galactic warp toward the inner galactic disk .",
    "using r@xmath40  kpc , @xmath60  km s@xmath1 , and a flat rotation curve beyond the solar circle , the _ revised _",
    "kinematic distance @xcite at the galactic coordinates of the source with an @xmath61  km s@xmath1  is 9.9  kpc , with no kinematic distance ambiguity as the source is in the outer galaxy .",
    "the small discrepancy ( @xmath62 ) between the kinematic distance of g75.30 + 1.32  and its trigonometric distance of 9.25  kpc can be accounted for by the small peculiar motion of g75.30 + 1.32  ( @xmath63  km s@xmath1 ) toward to the sun direction ( table  [ outer ] ) . on the one hand , this small difference hints at the validity of a nearly flat rotation curve up to the outer regions of the first galactic quadrant ( @xmath64 ; e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand , the small values of the peculiar motion of g75.30",
    "+ 1.32  along the galactic plane ( table  [ outer ] ) may be interpreted in the framework of a density - wave - induced spiral perturbation of the gravitational potential in a rotating galaxy @xcite .",
    "these perturbations give rise to systematic , residual velocities within the spiral arms of the order of 10  km s@xmath1@xcite : inside the corotation radius , at the inner edge of an arm these streaming motions are directed toward the galactic center and counter to galactic rotation ; at the outer edge , residual velocities toward the galactic center decrease to zero and point in the direction of the galactic rotation . outside the corotation radius residual velocities should be reversed ( e.g. , figure  2 in @xcite ; @xcite ) . by assuming a spiral pattern speed of @xmath65 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and a galactic rotation of about 240  km s@xmath1 , the corotation radius would be located at about 12  kpc .",
    "g75.30 + 1.32  shows a residual velocity toward the galactic center consistent with the star - forming region inside the corotation radius ( table  [ outer ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the streaming motions of star - forming regions measured so far along the outer arm ( table  [ outer ] ) show positive values toward the galactic center and suggest a corotation radius above a galactocentric distance of 13  kpc . on the contrary , @xcite located the corotation radius between the perseus arm and the outer arm in order to explain the opposite sign of residual velocities of their  regions .",
    "note that , this estimate accounted only for residual radial velocities ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "as soon as the bessel survey and the vera project increase the sample of 3-dimensional velocity measurements along the outer arm , we should be able to assess these issues with stronger statistical support .",
    "finally , we can estimate the pitch angle of the outer arm between galactic longitudes from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "we mention as a caveat that spiral arms in other galaxies can have `` kinks '' and variations of pitch angle over large portions of an arm ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for the simplest case of a logarithmic spiral arm ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we fitted the parallax data of g75.30 + 1.32  ( first quadrant ) together with the two previous ( trigonometric ) measurements of star - forming regions along the outer arm ( table  [ outer ] ) .",
    "this approach formally yields a pitch angle of @xmath68 which covers about @xmath69 of longitude between the first and third galactic quadrants . in figure  [ pitch ]",
    ", we display this result with the logarithm of the galactocentric radius as a function of the galactocentric longitude ( @xmath70 , defined as 0 toward the sun ) . while perfect - logarithmic",
    ", spiral arm sections should appear as straight lines in such a plot , the measurement for the star - forming region wb  89437 deviates from the fit by about three times the parallax uncertainty ( @xmath71  pc ) .",
    "this behavior may be explained when considering the spread of star - forming regions within an arm with a width of several hundreds of pc .",
    "the mean value derived here is in good agreement with a weighted average of published data for galactic spiral arms , which gives a mean pitch angle of @xmath72 @xcite , and agrees also with a more recent estimate of @xmath73 for the outer arm based on modeling of fir cooling lines from the galactic interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is consistent with the first direct estimate of the perseus arm pitch angle ( @xmath74 ) made with the trigonometric distances of its hmsfrs @xcite .",
