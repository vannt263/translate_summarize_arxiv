    "the escape of stars from clusters is a long - standing problem in the study of dynamical evolution of star clusters .",
    "the theory for the escape was first developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is based on the assumption that distant encounters between cluster stars will gradually set up a maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "some stars have escape velocity of the cluster and they escape .",
    "the timescale that the distant encounters set up a maxwellian velocity distribution corresponds to the two - body relaxation timescale ( @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number density of stars , @xmath6 is the mass of the cluster stars , @xmath7 is the average velocity of the stars , @xmath8 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath9 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "every time the two - body relaxation time elapses , a cluster loses constant fraction of stars which have escape velocity .",
    "therefore , the mass loss timescale of a cluster is proportional to the two - body relaxation time .",
    "this theoretical argument was confirmed by @xcite ( hereafter , b01 ) in the absence of the external tidal field .",
    "he performed @xmath0-body simulations of evolution of star clusters , and showed that the mass loss of the cluster happened on the two - body relaxation timescale for energy cutoff clusters , and on the two - body relaxation with backscattering correction for radial ( spatial ) cutoff clusters .",
    "however , the mass loss timescale from the clusters in external tidal field is remained unclear .",
    "the collaborative experiments @xcite demonstrated that the mass loss timescale does not scale with the two - body relaxation timescale , where multi - mass clusters moving in a steady tidal field were simulated .",
    "it turns out that the complication is due to the existence , at the initial setup , of population of stars that have energies above the escape energy and remain in a cluster before finding exits (  potential escapers  ) .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter , fh ) quantified the escape timescale of the potential escaper as a function of energy , and pointed out the escape timescale of the potential escaper is long enough to influence the whole mass loss timescale of clusters .",
    "b01 performed @xmath0-body simulations of star clusters , where equal - mass clusters of @xmath10 king profiles @xcite evolve in the steady external tidal field .",
    "he investigated the dependence of mass loss timescale on two - body relaxation times using simulations whose particle numbers are @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "he found that the mass loss timescale of clusters , @xmath1 , are proportional to , @xmath13 , the half - mass relaxation time to the power of @xmath14 , where the half - mass relaxation time is given by @xmath15 @xcite where @xmath0 is the number of stars , @xmath16 is the half - mass radius , and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found almost the same scaling law for multi - mass clusters in time - dependent tidal field .",
    "however , the @xmath18 scaling is not convinced as an asymptotic behavior at larger @xmath0 ( or @xmath19 ) for the following reason . in the limit of large @xmath0 ,",
    "the two - body relaxation timescale , @xmath19 , is much longer than the escape time delay , @xmath20 , which is the duration from the moment when the star gets energy above the escape energy to that when it actually escapes from the cluster .",
    "therefore , the mass loss timescale should be determined only by the half - mass relaxation time , i.e. @xmath21 .    the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the @xmath18 scaling obtained by b01 is an asymptotic behavior by means of @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "we perform sets of simulations of star clusters whose two - body relaxation timescale is larger than that of b01 and that are in the external tidal field with different strength .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe in detail the model of the cluster in section 2 .",
    "we show the results of @xmath0-body simulations in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is for discussion . in section 5 ,",
    "we summarize this paper .",
    "we investigate the evolution of star clusters in the external tidal field by means of @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "we adopt the conventional model in which the cluster is assumed to move on a circular orbit in a spherically symmetric galaxy potential , taken to be that of a distant point mass @xmath22 .",
    "we set the initial center of mass of the cluster at the origin @xmath23 , with axes oriented so that the position of the galactic center is @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that the size of the globular cluster is much smaller than @xmath25 .",
    "if the globular cluster rotates around the galactic center at an angular velocity @xmath26 , the equation of motion of an individual cluster member can be expressed as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the position of the @xmath29-th particle , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 are unit vectors that point along the @xmath32 , @xmath33 axes , respectively .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side in equation ( [ eq : motion ] ) is the gravitational acceleration from other particles in the cluster , the second term is the coriolis acceleration , and the third term is a combination of the centrifugal and tidal forces .",
    "we used standard units @xcite , such that @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the initial total mass and @xmath36 is the initial total energy within the cluster . in our simulations we used a softened gravitational potential expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is mass of @xmath39-th particle and @xmath40 is a softening parameter .",
    "we set the softening parameter , @xmath40 , as @xmath41 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : devi ]    as can be seen from figure [ fig3 ] , a cluster in stronger tidal field lose its mass sooner .",
    "the difference of the mass loss timescale is considered to be due to the difference of the escape energy ( the potential height at the lagrangian point ) , which is lower for a cluster in stronger tidal field .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows change in energy of an individual star for k3r1.0 and k3r2.2 models ( @xmath42 ) . in figure [ fig : fig4 ] we plot @xmath43 , the median value of the maximum energy records at a given time , @xmath44 ; @xmath45 @xmath46 of randomly selected 50 particles , where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 components of velocity of @xmath29-th particle , respectively .",
    "we do not update @xmath53 after stars escape from the cluster .",
    "the representative value , @xmath43 , may trace the energy acquired by two - body relaxations , on average .",
    "when stars obtain enough energy , they escape from cluster eventually .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the escape energy of each models , expressed as @xmath54    ( 120mm,75mm)figure4.eps    as shown in figure [ fig : fig4 ] , the increase of @xmath55 at @xmath56 is very similar among models k3r1.0 and k3r2.2 , which indicates that the relaxation processes in both models occur with almost the same timescale .",
    "however , because the escape energy in weaker tidal field is larger , it takes more time for a significant fraction of stars to escape in model k7r2.2 than in model k7r1.0 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig5 ] shows logarithmic slopes , @xmath57 , of the dependence on @xmath2 of the mass loss timescale shown in figure [ fig3 ] . actually , we calculated the logarithmic slope @xmath58 using a relation ; @xmath59}{\\log_{10}[t_{\\rm rh , i}/(t_{\\rm rh , i}/2)]},\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the mass loss timescale when the initial half - mass relaxation timescale is @xmath2 .",
    "( 120mm,75mm)figure5.eps    as can be seen in figure [ fig : fig5 ] , the logarithmic slope depends on the the strength of external tidal field . in model k3r1.0 , where the initial distribution ( @xmath10 king model ) and the tidal field ( @xmath61 ) are set to be the same as in b01 , we reproduce the asymptotic power , @xmath62 , obtained by him . note that the initial half - mass relaxation timescale of the run with the largest @xmath0 in b01 is about @xmath63 . on the other hands , when the tidal field is stronger ( model k3r0.8 ) the slope is smaller [ @xmath64 , and when it is weaker ( models k3r1.3 , k3r2.2 , and k3r4.5 ) the slope is larger than @xmath65 .",
    "the slope @xmath58 for the models in much weaker tidal field ( more k3r2.2 and k3r4.5 ) seems to approach asymptotically @xmath66 , not @xmath67 .",
    "the dependence of the slope is considered to be associated with the population of the potential escaper .",
    "for the clusters whose initial half - mass relaxation timescale is smaller ( or smaller @xmath0 ) , the escape time delay due to the potential escaper delays more the total mass loss of clusters .",

    "as seen in figure [ fig : fig7 ] , the differences between models k3r1.0 and k7r1.0 and between models k3r2.2 and k7r2.2 are small , which means the mass loss timescale does not depend so much on the concentration of the cluster .",

    "when @xmath0 is small , the half - mass relaxation time , @xmath2 , is sufficiently small compared with the escape time delay , @xmath20 , and it is expected to dominate the total mass loss timescale , @xmath1 . in figure",

    "the escape time delay is proportional to the average dynamical time ( fh ) . in this figure",
    ", we do nt plot that for model k3r4.5 , since only this model with @xmath11 and @xmath80 experiences core collapse before the half mass is lost .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : fig9 ] , all of the scaled mass loss timescales , @xmath81 , approach to @xmath82 around @xmath83 , which means that the mass loss timescale is determined mainly by the averaged dynamical timescale or escape time delay in small @xmath2 ( or small @xmath0 ) limit .",
    "( 120mm,75mm)figure9.eps      in section 1 , we conjecture that the mass loss timescale should be determined only by the two - body relaxation timescale at its large limit .",
    "our simulation results show that when the external tidal field is not strong ( ex . model k3r2.2 ) the mass loss timescale is almost proportional to the half - mass relaxation timescale",
    ". however , its logarithmic slope seems to converge to slightly small value , @xmath66 . here , we discuss origins of the small value @xmath84 .",
    "one possible answer is that the two - body relaxation timescale we used may not correctly scale the real relaxation process occurred in the cluster .",
    "another possible answer is that our simulation time span may be still not long enough to exclude the influence of the escape time delay on the mass loss timescale .",
    "our simulation result and analytical estimate appear to favor the later possibility .",

    "we can see that the @xmath86 lagrangian radii of clusters with different @xmath0 are in good agreement , which indicates that the half - mass relaxation time is surely a good measure of the internal relaxation process .",
    "we estimate distribution of the escape time delay in model k7r2.2 using the results of fh , which gave the distribution of escape time delay for fixed king potential in @xmath61 tidal field . according to this paper ,",
    "the fraction of the initial potential escapers staying in a cluster , @xmath87 , is expressed by @xmath88 ( 1 + 3.96 \\omega t { \\hat{e}}^2)^{-0.729 } + f_{\\rm non } ( \\hat{e } ) \\biggr\\ } , \\label{eq : delay}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the energy of a potential escaper , @xmath91 is the fraction of the initial potential escapers , and @xmath92 is the fraction of non - escaper , which can not escape from the cluster due to the regular orbits , in the initial potential escapers .",

    "this means that the mass loss timescale , @xmath1 , of clusters are still affected not only by the initial half - mass relaxation time , @xmath2 , but by the escape time delay , @xmath20 within our simulation span .",

    "both arise artificial errors in the calculated force .",
    "when calculated with grape-5 the force between two particles has a relative error of @xmath103 percent , because of the low accuracy of internal expressions in the grape-5 chip ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the force calculation by the tree algorithm also contains error of similar magnitude , though it depends on the opening parameter .",
