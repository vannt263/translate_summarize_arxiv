    "<S> we present a quantum theory for a fully coupled hybrid optomechanical system where all mutual couplings between a two - level atom , a confined photon mode and a mechanical oscillator mode are considered . </S>",
    "<S> in such a configuration , new quantum interference effects and correlations arise due to the interplay and competition between the different physical interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we present an analytical diagonalization of the related fully coupled hamiltonian , showing the nature and energy spectra of the tripartite dressed excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the driven - dissipative dynamics of such hybrid systems and study phonon blockade effects under resonant excitation . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the statistical properties of the photon emission obtained under incoherent pumping of the two - level atom , which is particularly relevant for experiments with solid - state two - level emitters . </S>"
