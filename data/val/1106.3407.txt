    "in 1934 , w.baade and f.zwicky proposed the existence of neutron stars only one year after the discovery of neutron . estimating the binding energy of neutron stars",
    ", they predicted that neutron stars are made by supernova explosions .",
    "neutron star had been an imaginary object for 30 years , until pulsars were discovered by j.belle and a.hewish in 1967 .",
    "neutron star has a radius of about 10 km and the mass about 1.4 times of the sun , and consists of four parts  @xcite .",
    "the region around 0.3@xmath4 from outside is called `` outer crust '' , where fe nuclei are expected to form a coulomb lattice . around @xmath5",
    "is called `` inner crust '' with a density about 0.3 - 0.5@xmath6",
    ". there are neutron - rich nuclei in lattice and dripped neutrons in a superfluid state .",
    "two central regions with higher density are called `` outer core '' and `` inner core '' , where speculated are proton super - conductivity , neutron super - fluidity @xcite , meson condensations @xcite , hyperon mixture @xcite , or quark states @xcite .",
    "the transition of matter composition with the change of density inside neutron stars causes a question : does it change continuously or suddenly ?",
    "a sudden change of matter property is generally accompanied by a first - order phase transition which causes an appearance of the mixed phase .",
    "ravenhall et al @xcite suggested the existence of non - uniform structures of nuclear matter , i.e.  the structured mixed phase .",
    "they suggested five types of structures as droplet , rod , slab , tube , and bubble . due to its geometrical shapes",
    "which depend on the density , we call it `` nuclear pasta '' like spaghetti and lasagna etc @xcite .",
    "many workers have suggested the existence of pasta structures in low - density nuclear matter , relevant to the crust region of neutron stars and the collapsing stage of supernovae .",
    "the existence of the pasta structures at the crust of neutron stars may not influence on the bulk property and structure of neutron stars .",
    "however , it should be important for the mechanism of glitch , the cooling process of neutron stars , and the thermal and mechanical properties of supernova matter .",
    "the pasta structures presented by ravenhall have geometrical symmetries .",
    "so we can treat the system with the wigner - seitz ( ws ) cell approximation .",
    "because of the convenience , the ws cell approximation has been very often used .",
    "but there may be some shortcomings .",
    "first , the existence of some kinds of structures other than the typical pasta structures were suggested .",
    "for example , in compressive process of matter , two droplets connect with each other and form dumbbell - like pieces @xcite .",
    "other examples are double diamond  @xcite and gyroid  @xcite shapes of matter suggested by using compressible liquid - drop model .",
    "these shapes ca nt exist as a ground state at zero temperature , so they might exist in supernova matter at finite temperatures .",
    "such structures are impossible to be described by the ws approximation .",
    "it is worth trying to calculate without any approximation whether or not these structures exist as a ground state or an excited state .",
    "there are several approaches for studying pasta structures in the literature , as liquid - drop model  @xcite , thomas - fermi model @xcite , hartree - fock  @xcite , quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd )  @xcite , relativistic mean field model ( rmf )  @xcite . in the studies using liquid - drop model and rmf model ,",
    "always used was the wigner - seitz ( ws ) cell approximation , where only the typical pasta structures are considered .",
    "qmd calculation does not assume any specific structure of baryons .",
    "but uniform electron distribution , though it should be almost uniform , is assumed . the thomas - fermi calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite and hf calculation @xcite used the periodic boundary condition and did not assume any geometrical symmetry in structure .",
    "however , the size of the periodic cell was not large enough for quantitative discussion .    in this paper",
    ", we use the thomas - fermi approximation for baryons with interaction by the rmf model .",
    "this model is not only simple for numerical calculation but also quantitatively reliable for the properties of finite nuclei and the saturation property of matter .",

    "the cell size is set to be the same as in ref .",
    "the difference between two results is that the bubble structure does not appear in the present calculation .    comparing the cases of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the upper limit of the density where non - uniform structures appear is different . in the case of symmetric nuclear matter",
    ", the density region of non - uniform matter roughly corresponds to the spinodal region , where @xmath47 , while the non - uniform region is slightly wider than the spinodal region for @xmath48 .",
    "this may be because the symmetric nuclear matter behaves congruently ( phase transition in a single chemical component ) , while the liquid - gas mixed phase in matter with @xmath48 is non - congruent and the values of @xmath49 in two phases are generally different .",
    "therefore the instability of uniform matter is determined not only by the compressibility of uniform matter but also by the chemical composition of the mixed phase to be formed .",

    "[ fig size with ws ] the size of the cell and the non - uniform structure .",
    "the density where each pasta structure appears is mostly in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite . however , there are large differences in the transient region of pasta structures .    in our calculation",
    ", we set , as the initial condition , the density distributions of fermions ( nucleons and electron ) and mesons randomly .",
    "so , the converged density distribution sometimes are trapped in local minimum states particularly at the density region where structure changes .",
    "let us discuss the case of beta - equilibrium at zero temperature , which is relevant to the realistic neutron star matter .    in figs .",
    "[ fig beta with ws ] and [ fig beta ] , we present density distributions by the ws cell approximation and the present three - dimensional calculation .",
    "while some pasta structures appeared for fixed proton mixing ratio , only the droplet structure appears for the beta - equilibrium case .",
    "this result is qualitatively the same as in the ws cell approximation .",
    "nuclear matter in the crust region of neutron stars includes the very small fraction of protons and electrons .",
    "so the contribution to the energy and pressure comes almost from neutrons and a little from protons and electrons .",
    "consequently the binding energy and pressure of uniform matter are almost the same as those of non - uniform matter .",
    "the proton mixing ratio @xmath49 , however , is significantly different between uniform and no - uniform cases .",
    "though it approaches to zero in the zero - density limit for uniform matter , there is a steep rise for non - uniform matter .",
    "it approaches to approximately 0.5 , which corresponds to a neutral atom in the low - density limit .",
    "we have performed the three - dimensional calculations for low - density nuclear matter and presented first results , based on relativistic mean - field theory and thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "for some fixed proton mixing ratios and for @xmath52-equilibrium nuclear matter , we have obtained non - uniform structures and the relevant eos .",
    "the observed structures are typical `` pasta '' structures , which were previously studied with the ws cell approximation . for @xmath45 ,",
    "all of the typical pasta structures appeared . for @xmath48 and 0.1 , however , some of the pasta structures did not appear .",
    "the density region for each type of pasta structure was also different between the ws cell approximation and the three - dimensional calculation .",
    "these may be due to the difference of the shapes of the cell .",
    "the ws cell for droplet , rod , slab , tube and bubble structures are sphere , cylinder , plate , cylinder and sphere , respectively . on the other hand , the cubic cell is used in the three - dimensional calculation . in any way , it is desirable to avoid the effects of the shape of the used cell .",
    "we therefore are planning to enlarge the cubic cell so that several periods of structures can emerge in it .    for @xmath52-equilibrium , we got only the droplet structure .",
    "this result is qualitatively the same as the one with the ws cell approximation .",
    "however , we can not definitely state that nuclear matter in @xmath52-equilibrium have only droplet , because other works with different interaction have observed pasta structures other than droplet . in @xmath52-equilibrium ,",
    "proton mixing ratio is largely different from that in uniform matter .",
    "it tends to zero for uniform matter at zero - density limit , while it increases in the case of non - uniform matter , and the asymptotic value should be 0.5 which represents atoms .",
