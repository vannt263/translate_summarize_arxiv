    "solute dispersion in porous media is of importance in many fields of science , such as chemistry , groundwater hydrology , oil recovery , etc .",
    "tracers , dissolved in a fluid flowing through a porous material , will experience dispersion in both the longitudinal ( downstream ) and transverse directions , due to thermal or fickian diffusion and the variability in both flow velocity and direction in the pores .",
    "tracers injected at one point ( e.g. , a leaking tank polluting groundwater ) will thus spread out into a plume .    over the past decades",
    ", many models have been proposed to model tracer transport .",
    "most models relate the dispersion coefficients to the flow velocity ( @xmath0 ) , a characteristic length scale ( the grain size or pore length @xmath1 ) , and the molecular diffusion coefficient ( @xmath2 ) via the dimensionless pclet number pe @xmath3 . due to the use of the microscale @xmath1 , the pclet number is a microscopic property .",
    "the most basic approach to computing the spatiotemporal evolution of the concentration of tracers is provided by the advection - diffusion equation ( ade ) , using separate values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the dispersion coefficients in the longitudinal and transverse direction , respectively .",
    "to explain the apparently anomalous behavior of the dispersion coefficients observed in experiments , more sophisticated models have been developed , e.g. , flow through random capillaries  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of  @xcite provided an initial approach to evaluate the macroscopic effects of microscopic pore geometry by means of an averaging procedure .",
    "percolation theory and continuous time random walks allowed handling long range correlations  @xcite .",
    "a range of numerical methods have also been applied to the problem , such as network models in which pore connectivity plays an essential role ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , full microscopic modeling of incompressible flow through porous materials has become feasible thanks to modern computing , and considerable successes have been obtained with this method ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new approach to understand the first - order relationship between dispersion and flow velocity ( and hence pclet number ) .",
    "it is based on a straightforward physical argument involving the competition of diffusion and advection in the pore channels , and leads to an accurate prediction of the observed behavior over the full relevant range of pclet numbers .",
    "the analysis also reveals the existence of a new material property related to the cited competition and the mesoscopic structure of pore geometry .",
    "consider the laminar flow of fluid through a regular or random homogeneous porous material .",
    "the flow is produced by a pressure difference ( head ) applied at opposite ends of the sample of porous material .",
    "this pressure difference induces a complex flow pattern inside the pores that can be computed exactly using the appropriate equations for an incompressible fluid , with appropriate boundary conditions , cf .",
    "@xcite .    due to the complexity of the pore structure ,",
    "the flow lines go apart and come together again as they traverse the material , dictated by the pressure head and the pore structure , so that the dispersion of the longitudinal distance @xmath6 among different flow lines tends to grow linearly as a function of the mean longitudinal distance @xmath7 , taken in the direction of the negative pressure gradient .",
    "regardless of the complexity of the flow pattern inside the porous material , the incompressible flow at every point is linear in the applied pressure head , so the geometry of this flow pattern does not vary as the head is varied .",
    "this leads to what is known as ` mechanical ' dispersion , with a diffusion coefficient given by @xmath8 where the mean longitudinal flow velocity @xmath9 has been taken as a measure for the pressure head , and @xmath10 is a geometric proportionality constant .",
    "thus , the longitudinal dispersion @xmath4 is linear in the mean longitudinal flow velocity @xmath0 . a similar argument",
    "can also be applied to the transverse dispersion , that is likewise linear in the flow velocity , but with a different ( smaller ) proportionality constant due to the significant geometrical angle between the direction of the mean pressure gradient and the direction of the transport : @xmath11 .    into this flow ,",
    "tracers are injected .",
    "these tracers are not merely advected with the flow , but in addition are subject to random ( thermal ) brownian motion . at zero or very small flow ,",
    "pure thermal diffusion will result , with diffusion coefficient @xmath12 . at large flow velocity , but still in the laminar flow regime , the thermal motion of the tracers can be neglected with respect to the advection , and nearly pure ` mechanical ' dispersion will result , @xmath13 or @xmath5 .",
    "we expect there to be an intermediate or transitional regime , in which global tracer dispersion should lie somewhere between the thermal and mechanical diffusion limits , but _ a priori _ it is not clear how exactly this dispersion scales with flow velocity .    following a tracer path through the pore channels of the porous material , there will be channels oriented at a small angle to the driving force , in which the mechanical dispersion will tend to dominate over thermal diffusion .",
    "other channels will be oriented nearly at right angles to the driving force , and there , thermal diffusion will tend to dominate over mechanical diffusion .",
    "thus , we propose modeling the mixed behavior in this intermediate regime by assuming that transport in each of the successive pore channels traversed by a tracer is dominated by one of the two mechanisms .",
    "in other words , we assume that a tracer alternately experiences thermal and mechanical diffusion .",
    "thus , the tracer experiences thermal diffusion for a fraction of time @xmath14 , with thermal diffusion coefficient @xmath15 . alternating with these phases of thermal diffusion",
    ", the tracer is advected by the flow for a fraction of time @xmath16 , during which it experiences a mechanical dispersion @xmath4 ( proportional to @xmath0 ) . therefore , the total dispersion of the longitudinal distance is the weighted sum of these two : @xmath17 so the net or total longitudinal diffusion is @xmath18 now , as the net longitudinal flow velocity @xmath0 increases , we make the essential assumption that the time fraction @xmath16 becomes progressively longer with respect to @xmath14 as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this is motivated as follows . as the drive is increased , transport in ever more pore channels",
    "becomes dominated by mechanical dispersion .",
    "so the time fraction ratio of mechanical to thermal dispersion a tracer experiences will be an increasing function of the velocity : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a critical velocity ( the velocity where mechanical diffusion starts to dominate globally over thermal diffusion ) . in the limit @xmath25 , one has @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . in the limit @xmath28",
    ", one has @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "both these limits agree with expectation . in the following",
    ", we will set @xmath31 for simplicity , but leave open the possibility that future studies may reveal more complex functional dependencies .",
    "to better understand the intermediate regime , we insert @xmath32 , and find @xmath33 which is recognized as a pad approximation .",
    "( [ longitudinal ] ) has _",
    "asymptotic behavior . for @xmath34 ,",
    "one has @xmath35 . for @xmath36 ,",
    "one has @xmath37 .",
    "but there is also an intermediate regime where @xmath38 .",
    "this regime occurs for @xmath39 and @xmath40 . summarizing : @xmath41 the intermediate asymptote only appears in full when the two corresponding limits are sufficiently far apart , i.e. , when @xmath42 .",
    "physically , the left and right asymptotes correspond to the limits in which one of the transport mechanisms ( thermal diffusion and mechanical dispersion , respectively ) dominates .",
    "the intermediate regime arises when the strength of the mechanical dispersion increases simultaneously with the fraction of time @xmath43 that the tracer is experiencing mechanical dispersion as compared to thermal diffusion .",
    "experimental data are commonly expressed in terms of @xmath44 versus pe , where @xmath2 is the molecular diffusion coefficient and pe is the dimensionless pclet number .",
    "the above expressions can be recast in this dimensionless form by substituting @xmath45 and @xmath46 \\{pe , pe@xmath47}. thus , the dimensionless form of eq .",
    "( [ longitudinal ] ) is : @xmath48    to test the validity of eq .",
    "( [ longitudinal_dl ] ) , we have fitted our expression to the numerical simulation data of @xcite and @xcite ( based on micro computer tomography ( ct ) scans of porous sandstone ) . due to the very low noise level of the numerical simulation ,",
    "this test is probably more stringent than testing the model against data from laboratory experiments .",
    "the fits , shown in fig .",
    "[ ovaysi ] , are a very good match to the simulated data .",
    "note , in particular , that the intermediate region ( with logarithmic slope @xmath49 ) is reproduced in full detail .",
    "transverse dispersion is different from longitudinal dispersion in that the drive is not very efficient in the transverse direction .",
    "therefore , the transverse mechanical dispersion is not able to compete with thermal diffusion , and thermal diffusion can not be neglected along any part of the tracer trajectory .",
    "the drive , however , is only effective in pore channels directed at angles less than 90@xmath50 with respect to the mean flow vector , during a fraction of time @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we get @xmath51 which expresses that thermal diffusion is always operative in the transverse direction , while mechanical dispersion ( with characteristic diffusion coefficient @xmath5 ) is operative only in specific channels , i.e. , for a fraction of the total time . due to the relative inefficiency of the drive",
    ", this approach is expected to yield less precise results than eq .",
    "( [ longitudinal ] ) , and minor corrections to this expression may be needed  @xcite .",
    "this is left to future work .",
    "following the same reasoning as before , we immediately find @xmath52    we have assumed that @xmath16 ( or @xmath24 ) has the same value here as with longitudinal dispersion , based on the assumption that the geometrical flow pattern is one and the same for longitudinal and transverse dispersion , although this is only strictly true in the limit of small thermal diffusion .",
    "the transverse dispersion has two extreme asymptotes that are equivalent to those of longitudinal dispersion , namely : for @xmath34 , one has @xmath53 , and for @xmath36 , one has @xmath54 .",
    "however , here there is no ` intermediate asymptote ' , but only a very gradual transition from one asymptote to the other , specified via the factor containing @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ transverse ] ) .",
    "the transition between asymptotes occurs around @xmath56 .     in dimensionless form , eq .",
    "( [ transverse ] ) becomes : @xmath57    a fit of the analytic expressions to an ample collection of measurement data is shown in fig .",
    "[ delgado ] .",
    "the figure contains data from 18 different experiments on longitudinal dispersion and 15 on transverse dispersion , spanning an ample range of the schmidt number , @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath59 , pe@xmath47 and @xmath60 were determined from a least - squares fit to the longitudinal dataset . for the transverse dataset ,",
    "the parameters @xmath59 and pe@xmath47 were held fixed at these values , while only @xmath61 was varied . by making a joint fit to all data ,",
    "the obtained parameters represent mean values over the various individual datasets .",
    "this procedure illustrates the generic dispersional behavior , covering a range of different materials .",
    "but much better results , with less scatter , are to be expected for fits to an individual dataset .    to illustrate the preceding remark , fig .",
    "[ carvalho ] shows an example of a fit to an individual longitudinal dispersion dataset .",
    "the fit is rather satisfactory .",
    "in previous work @xcite , the available experimental data were analyzed by subdividing the range of pe numbers into individual regimes and describing the dispersional behavior in each of these sections heuristically ( using , e.g. , power - law expressions  @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ exponent ] we show ( top ) the typical shape of the analytical curves , eqs .",
    "( [ longitudinal_dl ] ) and ( [ transverse_dl ] ) , with parameters similar to those used in the examples above ( @xmath62 , pe@xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) .",
    "the bottom panel in this figure shows the local power - law exponent , computed as @xmath66 the evolution of the local power - law exponent with pe number displays roughly the same behavior as the successive regimes described in @xcite .",
    "the intermediate regime does not develop fully as the condition @xmath67pe@xmath68 is only marginally fulfilled . thus , the intermediate power - law exponent for longitudinal dispersion only reaches a value of about 1.2 , instead of the maximum of 2 predicted by the model .",
    "this value ( 1.2 ) is consistent with the value cited in literature for the corresponding range of pe numbers  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we present a unified model for longitudinal and transverse tracer dispersion in laminar flow in porous media . based on a straightforward physical argument , an analytical expression is obtained that describes the observed behavior over the full available range of laminar flow velocities or pclet numbers .    in literature , it has been customary to use power - law scalings to describe the behavior of @xmath69 , each of which being valid only in a limited range of pe values  @xcite .",
    "the generic appearance of power - law scalings seemed to indicate that tracer dispersion in porous media was an anomalous transport process , characterized by fractional exponents  @xcite .",
    "however , in view of the present work , it seems that no anomalous transport mechanisms need be invoked to explain the observed behavior .",
    "this is a very satisfactory situation , at least for sandbox or glass bead experiments , in which the structure of the medium is not patently fractal .",
    "the present work has revealed the existence of two numbers that determine the dispersion curves : the critical velocity or pclet number ( @xmath24 or pe@xmath47 ) and @xmath70 .",
    "pe@xmath47 is a material property that depends on the pore geometry , so that different materials will have different pe@xmath47 values .",
    "the exploration of the dependence of pe@xmath47 on other material properties may provide further insight into its significance .",
    "it is of interest to note that we generally find that pe@xmath71 , rather than equal to one , as one might expect for the transition from dominant diffusive to dominant advective transport  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the scale at which this transition occurs is larger ( by a factor pe@xmath47 ) than the grain or pore scale @xmath1 .",
    "also note that the family of three - parameter curves given by @xmath72 and @xmath10 may explain a significant part of the observed data spread mentioned in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "finally , the intermediate region and the maximum value of the local longitudinal power - law exponent depend exclusively on @xmath70 .",
    "the analysis we present is consistent with the idea , proposed also by other authors  @xcite , that the main effects of porosity on dispersion can be modelled using a single characteristic mesoscopic length scale ( pe@xmath73 ) , and that the details of the microscopic pore geometry and inertial effects only lead to corrections to this generic behavior .",
    "the present modeling approach allows determining this mesoscale from the dispersion data . the present work does not pretend to provide the same modeling precision as the empirical scalings provided in the ample literature , but merely to provide improved insight into the generic behavior of tracer dispersion in driven laminar flow through porous media",
