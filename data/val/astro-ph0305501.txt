    "[ [ low - mass - stars - in - ob - associations ] ] low - mass stars in ob associations + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    historically , ob associations were identified as loose groups of coeval o - and b - type stars .",
    "however when extrapolating the mass function for ob stars to lower masses , it was found that most of the mass in such groups should actually be in low - mass stars ( @xmath2m@xmath3 ) ( e.g.  brown 2001 ) .",
    "indeed , h@xmath4 objective prism surveys and x - ray surveys unveiled large populations of low - mass stars in these associations .",
    "+ most stars may form in such associations ( walter et al .",
    "2001 ) , with massive and low - mass stars originating in the same star forming regions and at approximately the same epoch .",
    "if this is the case , then the presence of these luminous stars in the midst of lower mass siblings raises important questions : do ob stars influence the rate of lower - mass star formation and do they affect pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stellar evolution and , more crucially , circumstellar disk evolution ?    [ [ the - importance - of - circumstellar - disks ] ] the importance of circumstellar disks + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    circumstellar disks are an important part of the star formation process and are ubiquitous around young stars . even though they seem to be relatively short lived , they impact strongly on stellar evolution .",
    "the interaction between the disk and the stellar magnetic field plays a central role in angular momentum regulation and it is thereby likely to influence the spread of rotation rates in young stars .",
    "young stars may also accrete a significant fraction of their final mass from their disks , so disk evolution could impact strongly on theoretical pms models and attempts to determine stellar masses and ages .",
    "+ two very important questions are disk dissipation timescales and its possible mass dependence .",
    "disk dissipation timescales might be the strongest factor in determining the timescales for planet formation or whether planets form at all in a particular stellar system",
    ". this could be even more crucial in ob associations where there are exterior sources of photo - evaporating radiation .",
    "mass dependence of disk dissipation could be important in the context of brown dwarf formation .",
    "it has been proposed that brown dwarfs form by ejection from their parent systems ; numerical simulations ( bate et al .",
    "2003 ) propose that the dynamical interactions that eject brown dwarfs also truncate their disks , making them relatively small and of low mass .",
    "a testable prediction of such models is that brown dwarf disks dissipate faster .",
    "[ [ the - sigmaorionis - cluster ] ] the @xmath0orionis cluster + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    @xmath0orionis is a trapezium - like system with an o9.5v primary .",
    "the population of low - mass stars spatially clustered around this system was discovered as bright sources in rosat x - ray images , and follow - up optical spectroscopy confirmed most sources as pms stars ( walter et al .",
    "this association is young , nearby and affected by low reddening , making it an ideal target to analyse the pms population , even down to brown dwarfs and isolated planetary mass objects .",
    "the main goal of the work we summarise here is to probe the properties of the pms population in the @xmath0ori cluster , establishing a representative sample of cluster members and analysing the frequency and properties of circumstellar disks .",
    "[ [ photometric - surveys ] ] photometric surveys + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    firstly , it is necessary to identify the low - mass pms content near @xmath0ori .",
    "fig.1 ( left ) shows an @xmath1 colour - magnitude diagram , obtained with the wide field camera ( wfc ) at the isaac newton telescope ( int ) , where the pms stars can be seen separated from the bulk of the contamination .",
    "it was based on this diagram that targets were identified for follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "the figure also shows ( right ) the @xmath5 colour - magnitude diagram for cluster members  j - magnitude comes from the 2mass database .",
    "it shows most of the ( over 100 ) cluster members identified so far , either by us ( see below ) or from the literature ( e.g.  bjar et al . 2001 ; zapatero osorio et al . 2002 ) .",
    "overplotted are the model tracks and isochrones from baraffe et al .",
    "we estimate that the median age of the cluster is approximately 4myr ( oliveira et al .",
    "2002 ) and the sample covers the mass range 0.02@xmath61m@xmath3 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that a large number of brown dwarfs have been identified ( 30@xmath640 depending on the adopted age ) .",
    "several isolated planetary mass objects ( @xmath7m@xmath3 ) have been discovered in the cluster ( e.g. zapatero osorio et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "[ [ membership - analysis ] ] membership analysis + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    one of the main drives of our spectroscopic observations was to investigate how efficient photometric surveys are in identifying pms stars and thus cluster members .",
    "this is actually quite important for the disk frequency analysis as contamination leads to lower disk frequencies .",
    "+ we have performed spectroscopic observations of approximately 70 photometric cluster candidates with wyffos at the william hershel telescope ( wht ) .",
    "we use 3 means of diagnostic for cluster membership : radial velocity measurements ( compared with the cluster mean of @xmath832kms@xmath9 ) , the equivalent width of the lii 6708  feature ( a fragile element that remains unburned for stars younger than 10myr ) , and the equivalent width of the nai 8190  doublet ( a gravity indicator that is very weak in the spectra of giant stars , is strong for field dwarfs and weak for pms stars ) . using these indicators together we are able to firmly identify cluster members and binary candidates .",
    "we found that 90% of the objects in the photometric sample are indeed cluster members .",
    "this implies that photometric surveys are quite efficient in identifying cluster members .",
    "this analysis is described in kenyon et al .",
    "( 2003 in preparation ) .",
    "we have an on - going program to survey the circumstellar disk population in the @xmath0 ori cluster .",
    "the traditional first step is to look for k - band excesses in our sample of cluster members . using @xmath10 photometry from 2mass ,",
    "it has been established ( oliveira et al .",
    "2002 ; barrado y navascus 2003 ) that at most 10% of the cluster members exhibit a k - band excess that could indicate the presence of a circumstellar disk .",
    "however , a k - band excess is an unreliable disk indicator .",
    "it depends strongly on the inner disk temperature ; in particular for the lower mass stars , there is evidence that their disks are not hot enough to produce significant k - band excess ( natta & testi 2001 ; comern et al .",
    "2000 ) .      at longer wavelengths ,",
    "infrared excesses grow rapidly thus l - band observations are the most reliable and efficient way to detect circumstellar disks , down to the substellar regime .",
    "we have a program to observe all known @xmath0ori cluster members in the l - band ( and also in the k - band to avoid uncertainties related with variability , carpenter et al .",
    "2002 ) ; we have obtained data in january 2003 with the newly installed uist at the uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "due to adverse weather conditions we could only perform about 30% of the program , observing the targets in the mass range 0.2@xmath61.0m@xmath3 .",
    "we have since then been allocated more observing time at ukirt to complete this program .",
    "+ fig.2 shows colour - colour diagrams for the sample observed at ukirt . on the top left",
    "is the 2mass @xmath10 diagram ; only one object has a significant k - band excess , indicative of a circumstellar disk .",
    "the situation changes dramatically in the @xmath11 diagram ( top right ) where many stars seem to exhibit @xmath12 excess , evidence of circumstellar disks .",
    "a very revealing diagram is @xmath13 ( bottom ) . both photometric variability in i- and j - band and reddening would move an object s position almost horizontally in this diagram , while a disk excess moves an object vertically .",
    "this means that the diagnostic value of this diagram for the detection of disks is for all effects insensitive to variability and reddening .",
    "at least 30% of the objects seem to have an excess that indicates the presence of a circumstellar disk , but this value might be as high as 50% . only the computation of the intrinsic colour for each object will reveal the true percentage of objects with an excess ( oliveira et al .",
    "2003 in preparation ) .",
    "l - band observations are adequate for disk surveys , but in order to characterise circumstellar disk properties , observations at even longer wavelengths are necessary . based on estimates from the original iras data for the possible mid - ir emission of pms stars around @xmath0ori",
    ", we have targetted 12 such objects with timmi2 at the eso 3.6 m telescope to obtain n - band photometry , as well as q - band photometry and n - band spectroscopy for the brightest amongst them .",
    "+ fig.3 shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of these sources",
    ". indicated in the upper right corner of each graph is the spectral index @xmath4  that is a measure of the mid - ir excess .",
    "the three objects on the top row , @xmath0ori itself , @xmath0ori e and a rosat source are the more massive , early spectral type objects .",
    "their seds are consistent with the slope of the rayleigh - jeans tail of a blackbody ( @xmath14 ) , so there is no excess emission .",
    "the other objects all show an excess at these wavelengths , evidence of circumstellar disks .",
    "for instance , tx ori has @xmath15 consistent with a classii classification ( classical t tauri star , ctts ) ; the spectrum in the n - band reveals a feature consistent with silicate dust emission at 10@xmath16 m .",
    "based on the value of @xmath4 , most objects can be classified as classii objects .",
    "two objects exhibit seds that suggest more complex circumstellar structures : v510ori ( associated with a jet ) has @xmath4 consistent with a flat - spectrum source and iras05358 - 0238 has @xmath4 consistent with a classi source ( an intermediate state between an embedded class0 source and a ctts ) .",
    "this analysis is described in full in oliveira & van loon ( 2003 in preparation ) .",
    "we have combined photometric and spectroscopic surveys and identified a very significant number of cluster members , that together with other surveys constitutes a unique sample of pms objects , covering the mass range 0.02@xmath61.0m@xmath3 .",
    "+ we have begun a program to search for cluster members with circumstellar disks in the l - band .",
    "preliminary results on a representative sample ( 0.2@xmath61.0m@xmath3 ) indicate that at least 30% of @xmath0ori cluster members have circumstellar disks .",
    "when compared with two other clusters of similar ages ( ngc2264 at @xmath83.2myr and ngc2362 at @xmath85myr ) , a disk frequency of 30% for the @xmath0ori cluster would fit nicely between these two clusters ( disk frequencies respectively 52% and 12% ) , broadly agreeing with the 6myr timescale for all stars to lose their disk as proposed by haisch et al .",
    "as our l - band survey does not yet reach low enough masses , we are not able to address the issue of mass dependence of disk frequency .",
    "we intend to continue our program to search for and characterise circumstellar disks around fainter members of the @xmath0ori cluster .    99 baraffe i. , chabrier g. , allard f. , hauschildt p. , 1998",
