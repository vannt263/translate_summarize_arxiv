    ", we derive the pnlf distance to each of our six galaxies and compare these new measurements to estimates in the literature . in all cases ,",

    "7 we study the shape of the pnlf , and test for differences between various pn subsamples .",
    "we show that small variations in the shape of the pnlf are not uncommon , although these changes rarely affect our ability to measure distance .",
    "we conclude by discussing the possible implications of these fluctuations .",
    "we chose for our study six nearby spiral galaxies , all with low recessional velocities ( @xmath14  km  s@xmath15 ) , all relatively face - on ( @xmath16 ) , and , with one exception , all with large optical angular diameters ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "these galaxies are listed in table  [ galaxies ] , along with their photometric properties and metallicities .",
    "the two southernmost objects in the sample , m83 and ngc  5068 , were imaged with the mosaic  ii camera on the ctio 4  m blanco telescope . this instrument is composed of 8 @xmath18 site ccds , giving it a pixel scale of @xmath19 pixel@xmath15 and a field - of - view large enough to encompass the entire galaxy ( i.e. ,  @xmath20 or @xmath2110 disk scale lengths for m83 and more for ngc  5068 ) .",
    "the remaining galaxies were imaged with optic , an orthogonal transfer ccd camera on the wiyn 3.5  m telescope at kitt peak @xcite .",
    "optic , which consists of two lincoln lab ccid28 @xmath18 chips separated by @xmath22 , produces a pixel scale of @xmath23 pixel@xmath15 and a field - of - view , @xmath24 , that is slightly smaller than the typical size of our galaxies . as a result , our surveys with this instrument extended over @xmath61.2 , @xmath61.8 , @xmath63.5 , and @xmath67 disk scale lengths for ic  342 , ngc  6946 , m74 , and m94 , respectively .",
    "although optic is designed to track rapid image motion by real - time clocking of charge in both the vertical and horizontal direction , the lack of suitably bright field stars prevented us from using this feature .",

    ", we followed the standard observing procedure for imaging extragalactic planetary nebulae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "first we chose a narrow - band filter to isolate the [ ] @xmath12 emission line at the redshift of the target galaxy .",
    "for m83 and ngc  5068 , this filter was custom made , with a central wavelength of @xmath25 and a full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 46    in the converging f/2.87 beam of the telescope .",
    "for the remaining galaxies , standard kitt peak @xmath650    fwhm filters were used .",
    "these filters are listed in table  [ tabobs ] ; models for their transmission curves at dome temperature are displayed in figure  [ figfilters ] along with the wavelength of [ ] @xmath12 shifted to the systemic velocity of each target galaxy .",
    "@xmath12 filters used in this survey .",
    "these curves represent the filter at the outside temperature and in the converging beam of the telescope .",
    "the wavelengths of [ ] @xmath12 at the systemic velocity of each galaxy are marked .",
    "[ figfilters ] ]    each galaxy was imaged via a series of 30  minute exposures , with dithering sequences sometimes used to fill in the gaps between chips . for m83 and ngc  5068",
    ", corresponding 1 minute exposures through a standard @xmath26 filter served as off - band images ; for the wiyn observations , continuum observations were obtained via a set of 7.5  min exposures through the wiyn  32 filter ( @xmath27 , fwhm = 230   ) . in general , these off - band exposures were scaled to go at least 0.2  mag deeper than their on - band counterparts to avoid false detections at the frame limit . to help discriminate pne from ( lower - excitation ) regions ,",
    "each galaxy was also imaged in h@xmath13 . for m83 and ngc  5068 , the h@xmath13 filter had a central wavelength of @xmath28 and a fwhm of 80   , while for the other four galaxies , @xmath29 and fwhm = 46   .",
    "finally , for ic  342 , m74 , m83 , and ngc  5068 , images were also taken through a standard @xmath30 filter .",
    "these served as off - band images for the h@xmath13 exposures .",
    "all images were reduced using packages in iraf@xcite .",
    "the mosaic  ii exposures of m83 and ngc  5068 were reduced entirely within the mscred package : the data were trimmed , bias subtracted , and flatfielded via ccdproc , placed on an astrometric system by applying mscmatch to @xmath62800  stars from the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite , projected onto the tangent plane with mscimage , sky subtracted with mscskysub , aligned with mscimatch , and co - added ( with cosmic - ray removal ) with mscstack . during this process , special care was taken to define the images world coordinate system , as we found it necessary to run msccmatch separately on each individual readout section of each chip ( i.e. ,  16 runs per exposure ) to obtain a proper stacking and an astrometric precision of @xmath31 .",
    "we found the noao deep wide - field survey mosaic data reductions websiteto be very useful .",
    "the optic images of ic  342 , m74 , m94 , and ngc  6946 were reduced using a combination of iraf s imred and mscred packages .",
    "first , all individual exposures ( including biases and flats ) were converted to multi - extension fits ( mef ) format using mkmsc ; this enabled us to use the mscred package to correct for the four different overscan regions and the @xmath22 gap between chips .",
    "the optic reduction notesavailable off the wiyn website were very useful for this first step .",
    "next ccdproc was used to trim and flatfield as above .",
    "again , special care was needed to define the frames world coordinate system , as each readout section ( 4 per frame ) required a manual initialization with a centrally located star ( via ccsetwcs ) and then a refinement ( with ccfind and ccmap ) . for m94 ,",
    "only @xmath620 usno - b1.0 stars @xcite per quadrant were available for the astrometric solution ; for m74 , this number was closer to 40 .",
    "( since ic  342 and ngc  6946 are both close to the galactic plane , more than 100 stars per quadrant were available for their solutions . ) in all cases , our final astrometry attained a precision of @xmath31 .",
    "finally , mscimage was run to project the frames onto the tangent plane , linmatch was used to determine the scaling between exposures , and imcombine was used to remove cosmic rays and stack the images .",
    "pn candidates were identified by examining the stacked [ ] images , their h@xmath13 and off - band counterparts , and difference images created by scaling , then subtracting the off - band images from their on - band frames .",
    "pn candidates had to ( 1 ) have an image profile consistent with that of a point source , ( 2 ) be present in [ ] but invisible in the off - band image ( or extremely weak in @xmath26 ) , and ( 3 ) be invisible or weak in h@xmath13 ( and @xmath30 when available ) .",
    "this latter condition served to eliminate regions and supernova remnants from the sample ( see below ) .",
    "photometric measurements of all the candidates in [ ] @xmath12 and h@xmath13 were performed with the iraf version of daophot @xcite .",
    "first , the point spread function ( psf ) fitting routines in allstar were used to define the pn magnitudes on the difference images relative to those of field stars on the on - band frames .",
    "these results were then checked by using daophot s substar option to subtract off a scaled - psf representation of each pn from its position on the on - band and difference frames . although the majority of these subtractions produced little or no residual , a few objects , usually in or near the galaxy s spiral arms ,",
    "were found to be significantly under- or over - subtracted , sometimes by @xmath60.5  mag .",
    "the cause of this error was an incorrect estimate of the background : in regions of active star formation , bright emission from regions , supernova remnants , and the diffuse ism can play havoc with the underlying `` sky , '' particularly in h@xmath13 .",
    "when this occurred , the pn magnitudes were manually adjusted until the residuals on the star - subtracted images appeared reasonable .",
    "next our relative [ ] @xmath12 and h@xmath13 magnitudes were placed on the standard ab system by comparing large - aperture measurements of our field stars to similar measurements of spectrophotometric standards . for our southern hemisphere measurements ,",
    "these standards came from @xcite ; the stars in the north were drawn principally from the list of @xcite .",
    "finally , the narrow - band ab magnitudes were converted to monochromatic fluxes using models for the filter transmission curves in the converging beams of the telescopes ( figure  [ figfilters ] ) , knowledge of the galaxies systemic velocities ( listed in table  [ galaxies ] ) , and the photometric procedures for emission - line objects described by @xcite . in the case of our [ ] measurements , these fluxes were converted to [ ] @xmath12 magnitudes using @xmath32 where @xmath33 is given in ergs  @xmath34 s@xmath15 @xcite . at this time",
    ", we also used the photometric uncertainties derived by daophot to determine the mean photometric error of our measurements as a function of [ ] @xmath12 brightness .",
    "this photometric error function , which is given in table  [ photerror ] , was used to help determine the pnlf distances of  4 .",
    "planetary nebulae are not the only sources that are detectable via our on - band / off - band survey technique .",
    "deep images through an [ ] @xmath12 filter will also detect regions , supernova remnants , background [ ] emitting galaxies ( at @xmath35 ) , high - redshift ly@xmath13 sources ( at @xmath36 ) , and even asteroids . we discuss each of these below .      at the typical distance of our galaxies ( @xmath65  mpc ) , @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath625  pc .",
    "consequently , at groundbased resolution , compact regions will be unresolved , and can be misclassified as planetaries .",
    "fortunately , a quantitative way exists to eliminate most of these contaminants using two of a pn s brightest emission lines . @xcite",
    "have shown that bright pne populate a distinctive region in [ ] -h@xmath13 emission - line space .",
    "specifically , when @xmath38 [ ] ) is plotted against absolute [ ] magnitude , true pne occupy a cone defined by @xmath39 this equation , which is valid over the top @xmath64  mag of the pn luminosity function , is equivalent to the statement that the ratio of [ ] @xmath12 to @xmath40 depends on the luminosity of the planetary , via @xmath41 where @xmath42  ergs  s@xmath15 is the absolute [ ] @xmath12 luminosity of a pn at the bright - end of the pnlf . practically speaking , this means that pne in the top @xmath61.5  mag of the [ ] luminosity function always have [ ] @xmath12 brighter than h@xmath13 .",
    "this contrasts with the line ratios of the vast majority of regions , which have h@xmath13 much brighter than [ ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for three of our galaxies ,",
    "our narrow - band photometry was sufficient to locate each pn candidate in the [ ] @xmath12-h@xmath13 emission line diagram .",
    "candidates which failed to satisfy the criterion given by equation  ( [ eqsquiggle1 ] ) within the uncertainties were excluded from further consideration .",
    "unfortunately , due to clouds and poor seeing , the h@xmath13 images of the other three galaxies ( ic  342 , m74 , and ngc  6946 ) did not go deeply enough to detect the h@xmath13 emission from all the possible pne . specifically , in ic  342 only @xmath655% of our [ ] @xmath12 point sources were detected in h@xmath13 ; in m74 , the h@xmath13 recovery fraction was just @xmath620% , and in ngc  6946 , none of our bright pn candidates were detected in h@xmath13 . in the case of ic  342 ,",
    "its nearness ( @xmath2  mpc ; see  4 ) and extreme extinction ( @xmath43  mag ) helped to enhance h@xmath13 with respect to [ ] @xmath12 , somewhat lessening the shallow h@xmath13 imaging problem .    for ic  342 and m74 , we compensated for the lack of h@xmath13 photometry using spectroscopy .",
    "approximately 68% of the pn candidates in ic  342 have spectra obtained from the hydra spectrograph on the wiyn telescope .",
    "( a full description of these data is presented in paper  ii . ) for m74 , the fraction of pne with spectra is @xmath665% .",
    "although these data were obtained for the purpose of obtaining radial velocities and only covered the wavelength range @xmath64500    to @xmath65500   , it is possible to use them to estimate the h@xmath13 flux of each candidate .    to do this , we began by subtracting the continuum from each spectrum , and measuring the relative line fluxes of [ ] @xmath12 , [ ] @xmath44 , and h@xmath45",
    ". appropriately , the ratio of the two oxygen lines was ( on average ) , three - to - one , indicating that the response function within this small wavelength range was approximately flat .",
    "we then examined the throughput of the spectrograph using observations of a standard star .",
    "again , the data indicated only a slight ( @xmath68% ) decrease in efficiency between the wavelengths of [ ] @xmath12 and h@xmath45 .",
    "( this is close to the @xmath65% drop expected from the blaze function of the grating . ) using this knowledge , we derived the true [ ] @xmath12-h@xmath45 ratio for each object , then scaled these values to h@xmath13 , using an estimate of foreground galactic extinction @xcite , a @xcite reddening law with @xmath46 , and an expected intrinsic h@xmath13 to h@xmath45 ratio of 2.86 @xcite . for cases where",
    "the h@xmath13 flux was not detected photometrically , this spectroscopic measurement was used to estimate @xmath30 and eliminate compact regions from the sample .",
    "we note that this technique may overestimate the [ ] -to - h@xmath13 flux ratio for pne that are heavily reddened by circumstellar dust .",
    "however , these objects are likely to fall well below the pnlf s bright - end cutoff , and not be an important part of the sample .    in the extreme case of ngc  6946 , where no spectroscopy was available",
    ", the best we could do is place an upper limit on the h@xmath13 brightness of our pn candidates . to do this , we began by using the brightest point source magnitude returned by allstar during our analysis of the h@xmath13 frame .",
    "we then scaled the frame s psf to this magnitude , and used substar to subtract off this `` brightest star '' from the location of each pn .",
    "we then visually inspected the resulting image .",
    "as expected , due to differences in the underlying background , this procedure occasionally resulted in an oversubtraction .",
    "when this occurred , we manually adjusted the limiting allstar magnitude until the subtraction residual showed no sign of a flux deficit .",
    "this magnitude was then used to define the upper limit to the object s h@xmath13 flux . unfortunately , even with these limits , it was impossible to discriminate pne from regions with sizes under @xmath625  pc . thus , all the pn identifications in this galaxy must be considered tentative .",
    "although compact supernova remnants ( snrs ) are much rarer than pne , they may present a problem at the very bright end of the pnlf .",
    "this is particularly true for the more distant galaxies , where groundbased @xmath61  seeing limits our spatial resolution to @xmath625  pc .",
    "the difficulty is well - illustrated by @xcite , who used spatially resolved spectrophotometry to show that object 276 in the list of m31 bulge pne presented by @xcite is actually a supernova remnant .",
    "fortunately , most snrs have line ratios that clearly distinguish themselves from planetary nebulae .",
    "for example , of the @xmath660  m31 supernova remnants surveyed by @xcite , all but one has [ ] @xmath12 fainter than h@xmath13 .",
    "more specifically , we can compare the photometric properties of pne directly with those of supernova remnants using the optical sample of m83 snrs created by @xcite .",
    "their catalog contains 71 supernova remnants , selected on the basis of strong [ ] @xmath47 relative to h@xmath13 . of these , only three fall within @xmath48 of one of our pn candidates , and in each case , there is a better , more distinctive snr candidate nearby .",
    "none of the other 68 snrs are within @xmath49 of a pn .",
    "@xcite also presented 18 additional [ ] -bright objects , which they believe might be extremely young snrs .",
    "interestingly , all of these sources are significantly fainter than the prototype of the class , the milky way remnant cas  a. they are , however , comparable in brightness to the well - known smc remnant , 1e  0102@xmath507219 , and in theory , such objects can be confused with pne .",
    "seventeen of the @xcite [ ] -bright sources are more than @xmath51 from any of our candidates and thus not on our list . the remaining source ( o8 ) is coincident with our m83 pn candidate 10 , which satisfies our selection criteria in every respect .",
    "though we targeted this object with the hydra spectrograph , the resulting spectrum has very strong h@xmath13 emission .",
    "while there is virtually no h@xmath13 emission at the location of pn 10 , there is a strong h@xmath13 emitter within @xmath52 .",
    "we believe our spectrum is contaminated by this nearby h@xmath13 emitter due to a slight misplacement of the fiber by hydra .",
    "in addition , there are 17 historical supernovae in our target galaxies .",
    "an examination of our images demonstrates that none of the remnants from these sources are in our pn sample .",
    "we did find an emission line object within @xmath53 of the location of both sne in m74 ( sn 2003gd and 2002ap ) but found nothing of interest at the locations of sne 1983n , 1968l , and 1957d in m83 and only well - resolved emission - line sources within 5  of the locations of sne 1950b , 1945b , and 1923a ( also in m83 ) .",
    "of the nine historical sne in ngc  6946 , we found emission line objects near three ( 1980k , 1948b , and 1939c ) , some regions and blue stars near three others ( 2002hh , 1969p , and 1917a ) , and only star - like objects around the remaining three ( 2008s , 2004et , and 1968d ) .",
    "star - forming galaxies at @xmath35 have their [ ] @xmath54 doublet redshifted into the bandpass of our [ ] @xmath12 filter .",
    "consequently , it is theoretically possible for small ( @xmath55  kpc ) star - bursting objects to be mistaken for planetaries .",
    "in practice , however , such a misidentification is extremely unlikely . at @xmath35 ,",
    "our survey volume is @xmath68500  mpc@xmath56 for the ctio 4  m mosaic  ii data , and only @xmath6700  mpc@xmath56 for the galaxies observed with optic . according to the luminosity functions of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    ", this implies that our m83 and ngc  5068 fields contain less than @xmath6200  [ ] galaxies above our completeness limit , and that our optic images contain no more than @xmath620  [ ] emitters .",
    "less than 2% of these objects will have the extreme rest frame equivalent widths ( @xmath5760   ) needed to appear on our on - band frame , but be completely invisible in the continuum @xcite",
    ". moreover , many of these objects will be ( at least ) marginally resolved .",
    "thus , the number of background [ ] interlopers in our sample must be negligible .    in principal , ly@xmath13 emitting galaxies ( laes ) are another source of concern .",
    "these objects can have extremely large ( @xmath57100   ) observer - frame equivalent widths , and , in the absence of deep continuum images , can easily be mistaken for pne .",
    "large numbers of such objects have been discovered in deep [ ] @xmath12 surveys of virgo s intracluster space @xcite , and one has even been found masquerading as a pn in the m51/ngc  5195 system @xcite . fortunately , the surveys described here do not reach the flux levels needed to sample this population .",
    "none of the 162 laes found by @xcite in their deep 0.28  deg@xmath58 survey of the extended chandra deep field south would have been detected on our images of ic  342 , m94 , ngc  5068 , and ngc  6946 , and only their two brightest sources ( one an agn ) would have been seen in m83 .",
    "our survey of m74 does go deep enough to detect high - redshift ly@xmath13 emitters , but this galaxy was surveyed with the small field - of - view of optic .",
    "consequently , the luminosity function of @xcite predicts that only @xmath61 of our pn candidates should be a lae .",
    "the spectroscopy of paper  ii confirms this result : ly@xmath13 emitters are not an important source of contamination in our survey .",
    "since both m74 and m83 are located at low ecliptic latitudes ( @xmath65@xmath59 and @xmath618@xmath59 , respectively ) , one might expect to find asteroids in the images of these two galaxies .",
    "asteroids show up as trails on the long on - band exposures since they move quickly ( @xmath60@xmath60 min@xmath15 ) across the field of view and as nearly point sources on the short off - band exposures .",
    "this makes them very easily distinguishable from pne .",
    "we found no asteroids on our @xmath610@xmath61 m74 images but found four on our @xmath637@xmath62 images of m83 .",
    "the asteroid trails in the stacked on - band image correspond to asteroid sky position angles and speeds of @xmath6323@xmath63 at @xmath60@xmath64  min@xmath15 , @xmath6260@xmath63 at @xmath60@xmath65  min@xmath15 , @xmath6312@xmath63 at @xmath60@xmath66  min@xmath15 , and @xmath6299@xmath63 at @xmath60@xmath67  min@xmath15 , from brightest to faintest .",
    "a cursory check of the iau minor planet center website suggests the brightest asteroid on our images might be minor planet ( 16522 ) tell , which moves @xmath60@xmath60 min@xmath15 with a pa of @xmath68 and is expected to have been @xmath645  from the observed location on each of our four frames and have virtually the same motion .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis would be necessary to verify this possibility .",
    "after the application of the procedures of  4 , we were left with the following numbers of strong pn candidates in each galaxy : 165 in ic  342 , 153 in m74 , 241 in m83 , 150 in m94 , 19 in ngc  5068 , and 71 in ngc  6946 .",
    "the positions of these objects are displayed in figure  [ galimages ] ; figure  [ frat ] shows the location of the objects in the [ ] @xmath12-h@xmath13 + [ ] emission - line space . for the latter diagram ,",

    "a table of pn positions , fluxes , line - ratios , and radial velocities will appear in paper  ii .",
    "note that it is very difficult to find pne near the centers of galaxies and within the spiral arms , due to the bright stellar background and diffuse emission associated with regions of active star formation . since the ease of pn discovery increases as one moves to the lower - surface brightness outer regions of the galaxies , many of our pn candidates are at large galactocentric radii : for example , the percentages of pne beyond 2 @xmath26-band scale lengths are @xmath643% in m74 , @xmath693% in m83 , and @xmath673% in m94 .        the next step in our analysis was to determine our level of photometric completeness . to do this",
    ", we performed a series of artificial star experiments using the addstar task within daophot .",
    "first we examined each image and found the locations where [ ] emission from regions , supernova remnants , and shocks made pn detections problematic .",
    "these regions were masked out and excluded from further analysis . at this time",
    ", we also excluded bad ccd columns , detector edges , and the regions between the two ccds of optic .",
    "this removed @xmath625% of the disk area of m74 , m83 , and m94 within the galaxies inner three disk scale lengths , and @xmath616% of the disk area of ic  342 and ngc  6946 within one scale radius .",
    "( for the small galaxy ngc  5068 , no exclusion regions were necessary . )",
    "next , we scattered a small number of artificial stars of varying [ ] @xmath12 brightness throughout our on - band image . by adding no more than @xmath610% of the original number of detected planetaries to each frame",
    ", we ensured that image crowding was not a factor in our analysis @xcite .",
    "then we searched the frame for these artificial stars using the daofind task within daophot and a threshold value of three times the background sky . each recovery ( and non - recovery ) was noted , and the process was repeated several thousand times until the completeness fraction , as a function of [ ] @xmath12 magnitude and position in the galaxy , was well determined .",
    "finally , we fit this function to an equation of the form @xmath69 \\label{eqfleming}\\ ] ] @xcite . for purposes of this paper ,",
    "we define our limiting magnitude for pn detections to be the 90% completeness limit .",
    "this number is listed in table  [ tabobs ] .",
    "one of the galaxies in our sample has previously been surveyed for planetary nebulae .",

    "of these , four have slitless spectroscopy magnitudes that are more than 0.8  mag fainter than our measurements , and two have no measured magnitude at all .",
    "however , the remaining 38 have magnitudes that are consistent with our own .",
    "the scatter between the two data sets is @xmath70  mag , and the systematic zero - point offset between the two samples is only @xmath71  mag , with our values being slightly fainter .    finally , when we examine the objects that we tagged as likely regions , we again find good agreement .",
    "of the 16 sources , 10 were classified by @xcite as regions based on their extremely bright [ ] magnitudes .",
    "conversely , one object that @xcite considered too bright to be a pn is classified as a planetary in our sample .",

    "figure  [ figpnlfs ] displays the observed luminosity functions for each galaxy , along with the best fit models .",
    "we note that our analysis of the pnlf ignores the effects of internal extinction .",
    "this omission is justified for several reasons .",
    "first , @xcite have found that sc galaxies have very little dust extinction beyond two or three scale lengths of the galactic center . as we mentioned above ,",
    "many of our pn candidates in m74 , m83 , and m94 have galactocentric radii larger than this limit .",
    "moreover , @xcite modeled the effects of internal extinction on the pnlf by assuming that the vertical scale heights of dust and pne in other spiral galaxies are similar to those observed in the milky way .",
    "they found that the larger scale height of the pne make the pnlf method relatively insensitive to internal extinction .",
    "specifically , derived pnlf distances are never more than @xmath60.1  mag less than their nominal value , even when the total amount of @xmath78 extinction is large . in theory",
    ", this question can be addressed directly , via spectroscopy of the pne s h@xmath13 and h@xmath45 emission lines , though the faintness of h@xmath45 and the effects of atmospheric dispersion make the observations challenging .    in the sections below",
    ", we compare our pnlf distances to values determined from the analyses of cepheids , the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) , surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) , the brightest blue super giants ( bbsg ) , the brightest ( red and blue ) supergiants ( bsm ) , and the expanding photospheres of supernovae ( epm ) .",
    "though some of the galaxies also have tully - fisher measurements , the fact that we selected our targets to have low inclination makes these determinations unreliable .",
    "figure  [ ds ] and table  [ tabdmod ] compare our distance moduli to measurements in the literature .",
    "note that the zero point for all our pnlf distances is tied to that of cepheids via @xcite .",
    "thus , following @xcite , our distance scale assumes an lmc distance modulus of @xmath79 .",
    "ic  342 , properly dubbed the hidden galaxy , would be one of the brightest galaxies in the sky except for its location near the galactic plane ( @xmath80 ) and the large amount of foreground extinction ( @xmath81 ) .",

    "if we eliminate these objects from our sample , our derived distance to ngc  6946 increases by less than 2% .",

    "a few lingering doubts remain . in the _ hst key project s _ calibration of the population  ii",
    "distance scale , @xcite chose not to include the pnlf results in their final distance determination , since its distances were systematically shorter than those found from surface brightness fluctuations .",
    "more recently , @xcite claimed the detection of two kinematically distinct pn populations in the e6 elliptical galaxy ngc  4697 , with each following its own luminosity function .",
    "moreover , surveys of coma and virgo have presented evidence for the possible existence of overluminous planetary nebulae in intergalactic space @xcite .",
    "the best way to test the robustness of the pnlf method is to examine subsets of pne within a single galaxy .",
    "population gradients in spiral and elliptical galaxies are common @xcite , so if the pnlf is observed to be constant across the face of a galaxy , that presents strong evidence that neither age nor metallicity is affecting the luminosity function . unfortunately , to date , only a few pn populations have been studied in this way .",
    "analyses of the pne across m31 @xcite , m33 @xcite , m81 @xcite , m104 @xcite , and ngc  5128 @xcite have found no radial change in the pnlf , while the gradients found in m87 @xcite and ngc  4526 @xcite have been attributed to the presence of foreground intracluster stars .",
    "the planetary nebula samples of ic  342 , m74 , m83 , and m94 are large enough for us to examine the systematics of subsamples .",
    "we therefore divided the pne in these galaxies in three different ways : radially ( i.e. ,  by defining an inner and an outer sample ) , by the direction of rotation ( assuming that all pne are rotating along with the galactic disk ) , and by the orientation of the galaxy ( i.e. ,  near side versus far side ) .",
    "the first of these divisions should be sensitive to population changes within the program galaxy , the second to wavelength - dependent variations in the transmission of the narrow - band filter , and the third to host galaxy internal extinction .",
    "figure  [ galimages ] illustrates these divisions .",
    "figure  [ ksplot ] compares the cumulative luminosity functions of our various subsamples via a kolmogorov - smirnov test . in general",
    ", there is excellent consistency within the galaxies .",
    "however , as the statistic shows , a few anomalies do exist . in ic  342 ,",
    "the pnlf derived from the sample of planetaries on the approaching side of the galaxy differs from that derived from pne on the receding side at the 90% confidence level .",
    "interestingly , as the differential plot of figure  [ comparepnlf ] illustrates , both sets of objects yield identical values for the pnlf distance .",
    "however , while the planetaries on the receding side obey the luminosity function given in equation  [ eqpnlf ] , the approaching pne deviate from this law with 90% confidence .",
    "the pne of m74 show a similar effect , except this time the gradient lies in the radial direction .",
    "again , the pnlf distances inferred from both samples are nearly identical , but the detailed shapes of the two functions differ with 95% confidence . in this case , the problem can be traced to a deficit of objects @xmath60.3  mag down from @xmath122 .",
    "finally , in m83 and m94 , the pne on the near side of the galaxy follow a slightly different luminosity function than those on the far side ( at @xmath690% confidence ) . in m94",
    ", this difference does not affect the determination of @xmath122 , since it is primarily caused by a deficit of objects @xmath60.5  mag below the cutoff in the sample of planetaries north of the galaxy s major axis .",
    "however , in m83 , @xmath122 is affected : although both samples of planetaries are well fit by equation  ( [ eqpnlf ] ) , the pnlf for objects on the northwest side of the galaxy yields an apparent distance modulus that is @xmath60.18  mag farther than that derived from the southeast sample .",
    "this discrepancy is @xmath63 times the formal error of the fits .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the inconsistencies seen in the figure .",
    "the first is internal extinction in the host galaxies . in the milky way ,",
    "the scale height of pne is only slightly larger than that of the dust @xcite .",
    "such an intermingling can depress the magnitudes of some objects , but not others , and create a luminosity function very similar to that seen in the inner regions of m74 or the receding side of ic  342 .",
    "of course , to explain all the variations seen in figure  [ ksplot ] , one needs the extinction to be patchy , or at least have some azimuthal dependence .",
    "moreover , it is well known that the amount of dust in a galaxy declines with radius @xcite , so that if internal extinction is truly responsible for these effects , one would expect to see the pnlf change more with radius than with position angle .",
    "an alternative explanation involves assuming that the pnlf s shape is population dependent , and that the differences seen in figure  [ ksplot ] are due to subtle changes in the age or metallicity distribution function of the progenitor stars . to some extent , such changes should not be surprising . we know that the faint end of the pnlf is population dependent : while old systems such as m31 s bulge have exponentially increasing pnlfs , star - forming systems such as the small magellanic cloud exhibit a `` dip '' in the luminosity function starting @xmath62  mag below the cutoff @xcite .",
    "in fact , figure  [ figpnlfs ] suggests that the same dip seen in m33 and the smc may be present in m83 as well . however , there has never before been any evidence for small - scale features that distort at the bright - end of the pnlf .",
    "it is becoming increasingly clear that the term `` planetary nebula '' refers to a heterogeneous collection of objects .",
    "pne from single stars will have luminosities which depend on the mass of their central star @xcite .",
    "since central star mass depends on progenitor mass through the initial mass - final - mass relation @xcite , populations of different ages will produce different pnlfs .",
    "binary stars also produce planetaries via common envelope interactions , and their contribution to the pnlf may be very different from that of single stars @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite have proposed that the descendants of blue stragglers may contribute greatly to the bright - end of the planetary nebula luminosity function .",
    "the observed shape of a population s pnlf may involve a complex mixture of contributions from all these sources .",
    "the resiliency of the pnlf technique may simply be due to the processes which place a hard upper limit on the emitted flux at [ ] @xmath12 .",
    "the results of our analysis demonstrate that the pnlf is still an excellent standard candle .",
    "the distances presented to the six galaxies discussed in this paper are in good agreement with previous measurements , and the subsample comparisons performed in  7 indicate that there are no major population gradients in the pnlf cutoff .",
    "however , minor unexplained variations in the luminosity function do exist , and in some cases , this can introduce an additional @xmath60.2  mag error into the distances . at this time , it is impossible to determine whether these variations are intrinsic to the stellar population , or caused by internal extinction in the host galaxies . the fact that these are star - forming galaxies with large amounts of dust suggests that extinction is the cause , but the data from the @xcite survey of the elliptical galaxy ngc  4697 and the observation of virgo s intracluster stars @xcite suggest otherwise . in theory , one can discriminate between these ( non - exclusive ) hypotheses via spectrophotometry of the objects h@xmath13/h@xmath45 ratio . in practice , however , such a study is extremely difficult . in a typical bright planetary ,",
    "h@xmath45 is @xmath610  times weaker than [ ] @xmath12 , so obtaining accurate measurements is a challenge .",
    "moreover , pne are subject to circumstellar extinction , as well as galactic extinction .",
    "disentangling the two components will require the analysis of large samples of objects , in many different galactic environments .",

    "<S> as the first step to determine disk mass - to - light ratios for normal spiral galaxies , we present the results of an imaging survey for planetary nebulae ( pne ) in six nearby , face - on systems : ic  342 , m74 ( ngc  628 ) , m83 ( ngc  5236 ) , m94 ( ngc  4736 ) , ngc  5068 , and ngc  6946 . using blanco / mosaic  ii and wiyn / optic , </S>",
    "<S> we identify 165 , 153 , 241 , 150 , 19 , and 71 pn candidates , respectively , and use the planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf ) to obtain distances . for m74 and ngc  5068 , </S>",
    "<S> our distances of @xmath0  mpc and @xmath1  mpc are the first reliable estimates to these objects ; for ic  342 ( @xmath2  mpc ) , m83 ( @xmath3  mpc ) , m94 ( @xmath4  mpc ) , and ngc  6946 ( @xmath5  mpc ) our values agree well with those in the literature . in the larger systems , we find no evidence for any systematic change in the pnlf with galactic position , though we do see minor field - to - field variations in the luminosity function . in most cases , these changes do not affect the measurement of distance , but in one case the fluctuations result in a @xmath60.2  mag shift in the location of the pnlf cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possible causes of these small - scale changes , including internal extinction in the host galaxies and age / metallicity changes in the underlying stellar population . </S>"
