    "in a classic paper @xcite , dirac proposed the possible existence of a magnetic monopole , the analogue of an isolated electrically charged particle .",
    "motivated principally to restore the symmetries between electric and magnetic forces , dirac found that the existence of a monopole provided a natural explanation for the quantization of electric charge .",
    "a description of such a monopole consistent with quantum mechanics would lead to the famous dirac charge quantization condition , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fine structure constant , @xmath6 is the monopole charge , and @xmath7 an integer .",
    "dirac s theory required a @xmath8 valued gauge potential which was singular along a line ( dirac string ) originating from the monopole and extending to infinity .",
    "later dirac s theory was reformulated by wu and yang  @xcite within the framework of fiber bundles .",
    "the singular line is avoided at the expense of introducing coordinate patches on a sphere surrounding the monopole .",
    "however , the transition functions between the coordinate patches that are elements of the @xmath8 gauge group are singular . thus , there is a complete equivalence between the two descriptions  @xcite and the monopole emerges on a sound footing like any other particle in nature .",
    "consequently , during the past decades , extensive effort has gone into experimental search for monopoles , but unfortunately has as yet had no success .    in spite of the lack of experimental success",
    ", the monopole continues to thrive in the theoretical laboratory . with the pioneering work of t hooft and polyakov @xcite , the monopole was reinvented in a new form as a finite energy , particle - like soliton in non - abelian gauge theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "moreover , such objects are generic in any spontaneously broken non - abelian gauge theory which has an unbroken @xmath8 gauge symmetry .",
    "such monopoles are expected to be produced in abundance in phase transitions of grand unified theories , which has implications for early universe cosmology .",
    "new searches for such relic monopoles are under way @xcite .    more recently , a great deal of activity has centered around monopoles in curved space - time in order to study the effects of gravity .",
    "new insights have emerged from a study of a coupled einstein - yang - mills - higgs [ eymh ] system with solutions describing black holes with magnetic charge , black holes within magnetic monopoles and magnetic monopoles within black holes  @xcite .",
    "consequently , gravity can not be dispensed with , arguing that the strength of its interaction is weak .",
    "the coupled set of equations for the eymh system lead to non - trivial consequences and provide a fertile ground for the study of the interplay between gravitation and other interactions .",
    "the present paper is an extension of the work by nguyen and wali  @xcite to include electric charge and to study dyons coupled to gravity .",
    "the starting point is a modified eymh system with a specific coupling of the higgs field to the einstein term in the action . in the static case , this enables us , with the help of a bogomolnyi - type  [ 9 ] condition , to reduce the energy functional to a form that resembles the energy functional in flat space - time and derive a lower bound on the energy and hence the mass of the dyon in terms of its electric and magnetic charges .    in the next section ,",
    "we begin with a review of the general formalism and the field equations for the coupled eymh system . in section 3 ,",
    "we derive the field equations and the energy functional in the static case . through the higgs field equation ,",
    "we express the einstein term in the action in terms of metric fields , find a positive definite expression for the energy functional , and derive a lower bound on the energy .",
    "we also discuss in this section , the relation between the mass and the charge of the dyon .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the derivation of the basic equations in the context of a spherically symmetric static metric and the spherically symmetric t hooft - polyakov ansatz for the gauge and higgs fields . in section 5",
    ", we specialize to the higgs vacuum and find monopole and dyon solutions .",
    "the final section is devoted to some concluding remarks .",
    "we begin by defining the action , @xmath9 where @xmath10 with @xmath11 , the ricci scalar , @xmath12 , the cosmological constant and @xmath13 , the higgs scalar field .",
    "our metric @xmath14 is chosen to have signature @xmath15 with indicies @xmath16 running from 0 to 3 and indicies @xmath17 from 1 to 3 , also @xmath18 .",

    "results are shown in figs   [ solutions ] , [ extremalmonopole ] and [ nonextremalmonopole ] .",
    "we observe that we have a family of solutions that have exponentially vanishing non - abelian components @xmath149 .",
    "they are determined by the initial condition @xmath150 ( see fig .",
    "[ solutions ] ) .",
    "these solutions are characterized by a non - abelian core , outside of which only an abelian component remains .",
    "the solutions to the metric components @xmath151 and @xmath140 in general have a minimum and maximum respectively in the vicinity of @xmath152 . from eqn .",
    "( [ 515 ] ) the metric component @xmath151 is dependent on an initial condition , however , once one fixes its asymptotic behavior ( @xmath153 as @xmath154 ) it is uniquely determined .",
    "the metric component @xmath140 automatically has the correct asymptotic behavior .",
    "we see that as the initial value of @xmath130 at @xmath152 approaches zero , the minimum of @xmath151 also approaches zero at @xmath152 ( and the maximum @xmath140 at @xmath152 gets larger ) .",
    "the solution for @xmath155 ( see fig .",
    "[ extremalmonopole ] ) represents the extremal case where an event horizon has formed .",
    "this extremal solution is a black hole with a non - abelian magnetic monopole .    for the extremal solution ,",
    "the non - abelian magnetic field is confined within the black hole horizon .",
    "thus it is only natural that the metric coefficients outside the horizon are identical to that of a reissner - nrdstrom black hole . in fig .",
    "[ extremalmonopole ] we see that the metric coefficient for @xmath151 vanishes inside the horizon , @xmath156 .",
    "this is not a problem since @xmath151 has been normalized at @xmath157 .",
    "an observer at infinity can not observe the interior of the black hole since for him an object takes an infinite amount of time to reach the horizon . if one choses to normalize @xmath151 at the origin one would have a perfectly well defined metric inside the horizon which is infinite outside .",
    "this does not affect the determination of the non - abelian magnetic field @xmath130 which is independent of the normalization of @xmath151 .",
    "this behaviour is also observed in the monopole solutions of lue and weinberg  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ nonextremalmonopole ] we see a non - extremal monopole solution that is not a black hole .",
    "the set of seven coupled non - linear equations ( [ 53])-([59 ] ) involve four functions , @xmath130 , @xmath125 , @xmath151 and @xmath140 .",
    "we do not expect to find analytic solutions to this set of equations .",
    "thus we are forced to look for numerical solutions .",
    "first , however we can analyse some features of these equations . equation ( [ 57 ] ) is a quadratic equation in @xmath158 which has the solutions @xmath159    combining equations ( [ 53 ] ) and ( [ 518 ] ) for @xmath158 , we obtain @xmath160    by inspection , we see that if @xmath144 , the case of an abelian dyon , then the above equation implies that @xmath161 assuming @xmath162 .",
    "this in turn implies that the product @xmath163 is constant .",
    "thus the yang - mills field equation ( [ 55 ] ) reduces to @xmath164 which has the analytic solution @xmath165 where @xmath166 are arbitrary constants .",
    "furthermore , if the charge distribution is assumed to vanish asymptotically , then @xmath167 . together with the asymptotic conditions on the metric functions @xmath151 , @xmath140 , we can show that the cosmological constant @xmath12 must vanish .",
    "however , inspection of equation  ( [ 59 ] ) leads to a contradiction ; which proves that there are no abelian dyonic solutions to our equations ( in contrast to the monopole case ) .    for the general case of non - abelian dyon solutions with @xmath168 , examination of the asymptotic behaviour of equation  ( [ 59 ] )",
    "reveals that for consistent solutions the cosmological constant must vanish .",
    "proceeding , we find two coupled equations in @xmath130 and @xmath125 , whose solutions yield consistent solutions to all the equations .",
    "these are @xmath169 @xmath170=0\\label{quartic}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the solutions to @xmath130 and @xmath125 yield the metric functions @xmath151 and @xmath140 via the following equations : @xmath171    equation  ( [ quartic ] ) is a quartic polynomial in @xmath172 in terms of @xmath130 and @xmath173 . since @xmath125 is positive and the requirement that @xmath125 vanish asymptotically implies that @xmath172 should be negative everywhere ( as long as @xmath125 is montonic ) .",
    "thus we select the negative real root of the quartic polynomial",
    ". equation  ( [ 2ndorder ] ) is a non - linear second order differential equation in @xmath130 which can be readily integrated numerically using a 4th order runga - kutta with initial conditions set at @xmath152 .",
    "inspection of equations  ( [ 2ndorder ] ) and ( [ quartic ] ) reveals that in order for @xmath130 to vanish , it can only occur at @xmath152 .",
    "one can perform a similar inspection of abel s equation in the monopole case where it is also evident that @xmath130 can also only vanish at @xmath152 .",
    "thus , like in the monopole case one expects that the extremal black hole solution will be reach as the initial condition for @xmath174 .",
    "however , unlike the monopole case there is an additional parameter , the initial value of @xmath173 at @xmath152 .",
    "figures  [ yandj1 ] and [ aandb1 ] contain plots of the solutions for @xmath130 , @xmath125 , @xmath151 and @xmath140 for initial conditions @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 . the initial value of @xmath151 is set in order to obtain it s correct asymptotic behavior .",
    "for these initial conditions the metric function @xmath151 does not have a minimum and @xmath140 does not have a maximum at finite @xmath124 .",
    "however , as one adjusts the initial conditions closer to the critical value , @xmath155 , a minima and maxima begin to appear .",
    "this is evident in figures  [ yandj2 ] and [ aandb2 ] where the initial conditions are @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath178 .",
    "while inspecting the parameter space of initial conditions for @xmath182 one finds that @xmath183 in order for solutions to exist . for a value of @xmath182 in this range",
    "one finds that @xmath184 can not be made arbitrarily close to zero if one requires the numerical solution to be continuously defined for all @xmath124 .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath184 for a well defined solution depends on the value of @xmath182 .",
    "solutions for values of @xmath184 closer to zero exhibit numerical singularities in the region @xmath185 .",
    "the probable explanation for this is that unlike an extremal monopole which only has only one horizon , a dyonic black hole naturally has two horizons .",
    "thus , as the solution approaches the black hole limit the appearance of one of the horizons might occur first ( meaning the metric coefficient @xmath151 becomes small and @xmath140 becomes large at some value of @xmath124 ) . also , with the existence of two horizons it is clear that our metric ( equation  ( [ 41 ] ) ) , which has positive coefficients @xmath186 and @xmath187 , can not properly describe the region between two horizons where the space - like and time - like co - ordinates flip .",
    "thus , it is not unreasonable that as our dyonic solution becomes a black hole ( by tuning the initial conditions closer to their critical values ) , that the co - ordinates we used are not appropriate for all values of @xmath124 .",
    "we have shown in section 3 that , with an ansatz , eqn .",
    "( [ 34 ] ) , we are led to bogomolnyi type equations and an energy functional that is bounded from below in the case of a dyon . in flat space - time , solutions that saturate the bogomolnyi bound are known to exist @xcite . demonstrating this in the case of a non - abelian dyon in curved space - time is a new result .",
    "these results follow from the form of the action in eqn .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) , where the higgs scalar is directly coupled to the ricci scalar . in the monopole case , this unconventional coupling led to a first order classic abel s equation , the solution of which yielded solutions to all the equations in the problem @xcite . in the dyon case , the problem turns out to be more complicated ; nonetheless , contains similar simplifications in contrast to the more standard approaches in the literature .",
    "in section 5 , we specialize to higgs vacuum solutions to the general equations in section 4 . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "we begin with a review of the non - abelian monopole solutions @xcite .",
    "we expand on the discussions therein .",
    "these monopole solutions depend upon initial conditions ; for a specific choice the solution represents a non - abelian extremal black hole . in addition we show that in our model there are no solutions with a non - vanishing cosmological constant in contrast to the conventional model in @xcite .",
    "we also present numerical evidence for non - abelian dyonic solutions .",
    "for a range of initial conditions the defining equations yield stable numerical results which are well - defined to the center of the dyon .",
    "however , as the initial conditions are tuned closer to critical values , the numerical results have singularities that likely correspond to the formation of horizons .",
    "also as in the monopole case , physically interesting solutions require a vanishing cosmological constant , and further , unlike in the case of the monopole , there is no abelian dyon solution in our model .",
    "finally , to the best of our knowledge , a direct proof of dirac charge quantization in the case of the eymh system does not exist . however , there are compelling reasons to think , that the topological considerations in the case of flat space - time can be extended to curved space - time",
    ". if so , it has some extremely interesting consequences that have been pointed out by ignatev , joshi and wali   @xcite . among them , are the consequences that magnetically or electrically charged black holes obey a lower bound on their mass and the consequence that is not widely appreciated , namely , the spectrum of magnetically ( or electrically ) charged extremal black holes are evenly spaced in mass due to charge quantization .    this work was supported in part ( jsr and kcw ) by the u.s department of energy ( doe ) under contract no .",
