    "fundamental m - theory in the low - energy limit is generally believed to be effectively described by @xmath0 supergravity @xcite .",
    "this suggests that brane solutions in the latter theory furnish classical soliton states of m - theory , motivating considerable interest in this subject .",
    "there is particular interest in supersymmetric @xmath1-brane solutions that saturate the bps bound upon reduction to 10 dimensions .",
    "some supersymmetric solutions of two or three orthogonally intersecting 2-branes and 5-branes in @xmath0supergravity were obtained some years ago @xcite , and more such solutions have since been found @xcite .",
    "recently interesting new supergravity solutions for localized d2/d6 , d2/d4 , ns5/d6 and ns5/d5 intersecting brane systems were obtained hashi , cgmm2,cgmm5 . by lifting a d6 ( d5 or d4)-brane to four - dimensional taub - nut / bolt and eguchi - hanson geometries embedded in m - theory",
    ", these solutions were constructed by placing m2- and m5-branes in the taub - nut / bolt and eguchi - hanson background geometries .",
    "the special feature of these constructions  is that the solution is not restricted to be in the near core region of the d6 ( d5 or d4)-brane .",
    "taub - nut space is a special case of the atiyah - hitchin space and since the building blocks of m - theory are m2- and m5-branes , it is natural to investigate the possibility of placing m2- and m5-branes in the atiyah - hitchin background space .",
    "this is the subject of the present paper , in which we consider the embedding of  atiyah - hitchin geometry in m - theory with an m2- or m5-brane .  for all of the different solutions we obtain ,",
    "1/4 of the supersymmetry is preserved , and the metric has bolt - like fixed points ( i.e. of maximal co - dimensionality ) .",
    "this is an interesting feature of all the solutions we obtain , quite distinct from all previously constructed m - brane solutions with bolt - like fixed points @xcite , for which no supersymmetries are preserved .",
    "the difference arises as a result of the self - duality of the atiyah - hitchin metric compared to non - self - dual taub - bolt metrics . in the former case ,",
    "self - duality preserves some supersymmetry while in the latter case , the lack of self - duality precludes any possible supersymmetry .",
    "we then compactify these solutions on a circle , obtaining the different fields of type iia string theory .",
    "explicit calculation shows that in all cases the metric is asymptotically ( locally ) flat , though for some of our compactified solutions the type iia dilaton field diverges at infinity .",
    "the atiyah - hitchin space is a part of the set of two monopole solutions of bogomolnyi equation .",
    "the moduli space of solutions is of the form@xmath2where the factor @xmath3 describes the center of mass of two monopoles and a phase factor that is related to the total electric charge of the system .",
    "the interesting part of the moduli space is the four dimensional manifold @xmath4 , which has self - dual curvature .",
    "the self - duality comes from the hyper - khler property of the moduli space .",
    "since @xmath3 is flat and decouples from @xmath4 , the four dimensional manifold @xmath4 should be hyper - khler , which is equivalent to a metric with self - dual curvature in four dimensions . the manifold @xmath4 describes the separation of the two monopoles and their relative phase angle ( or electric charges ) .",
    "a further aspect concerning @xmath4 is that it should be @xmath5  invariant , since two monopoles do exist in ordinary flat space ; hence the metric on @xmath4 can be expressed in terms of three functions of the monopole separation .",
    "self - duality implies that these three functions obey a set of first - order ordinary differential equations .    in recent years , this space and its various generalizations were identified with the full quantum moduli space of @xmath6 supersymmetric gauge theories in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in section [ sec : review ] , we discuss briefly the field equations of supergravity , the m2- and m5-brane metrics and the killing spinor equations . in section",

    "the resulting fields describe an ns5@xmath7d6(5 ) system which preserves 1/4 of the supersymmetry .",
    "we expect in the decoupling limit of our solution that is in the limit of vanishing string coupling , the theory on the worldvolume of the ns5-branes is a type iia little string theory @xcite .",
    "a different m5-brane solution can be obtained by reversing the sign of the separation constant @xmath209  in the separated differential equations obtained from ( [ heqform5 ] ) .  in this case , by taking @xmath210  , we find another solution in the form of@xmath245where numerical plot of the function @xmath246  is given in figures [ figrsc ]  and [ m2ratlargersc ] for @xmath247and large @xmath16  regions , respectively .  although this is formally a solution , the integral in ( [ ahgeneralhform5ss ] ) is not convergent for all values of @xmath15 . to make the integral convergent for @xmath248",
    ", one can replace @xmath249  by @xmath250 , but only at the price of introducing a source term at @xmath216  in the corresponding laplace equation for @xmath251    as before , we do not have a representation of 10d fields since  @xmath244  is not a killing vector except for @xmath252  however , we note that at large @xmath16 , we have @xmath121  up to terms of order of @xmath122  and in this case , by using the reduction relations ( fkkreduced1 ) and ( [ fkkreduced2 ] ) , the explicit fields in 10d describe an ns5@xmath7d6(5 ) system that preserves 1/4 of the supersymmetry cgmm5 .",
    "so although the 10d brane system fields corresponding to m5-brane solution ( [ ds11m5p ] ) with metric functions ( [ ahgeneralhform5 ] ) or ( [ ahgeneralhform5ss ] ) can not be written explicitly , the asymptotic behavior of the system is given by the known fields of the  ns5@xmath7d6(5 ) system that preserves 1/4 of the supersymmetry .",
    "as the last case , we expect in the decoupling limit of solution corresponding to ( [ ahgeneralhform5ss ] ) , the theory on the worldvolume of the ns5-branes is a type iia little string theory @xcite .",
    "we see again that the m5-brane solution ( [ ahgeneralhform5 ] ) with an atiyah - hitchin space in the transverse geometry preserves 1/4 of the supersymmetry even though the atiyah - hitchin space has a bolt - like fixed point at @xmath253  this behaviour is completely different from that found in @xcite , where the only m5-brane solutions preserving any supersymmetry had nut - like fixed points ( i.e. of less than maximal co - dimensionality ) .",
    "the m5-brane solutions with four dimensional transverse taub - bolt space were not supersymmetric .",
    "unlike these cases , the four - dimensional atiyah - hitchin space is self - dual hyper - khler , thereby preserving some supersymmetry in the associated m5-brane solutions .",
    "by embedding atiyah - hitchin space into m - theory , we have found new classes of  2-brane and 5-brane solutions to @xmath0  supergravity . these exact solutions are new m2- and m5-brane metrics with metric functions ( ahgeneralh ) , ( [ hfintnah ] ) , ( [ hfinehah ] ) , ( [ hahah2 ] ) , ( hahss2 ) , ( [ ahgeneralhform5 ] ) and ( [ ahgeneralhform5ss ] )  these are the main results of this paper .",
    "the common feature of both solutions is that the brane function is a convolution of an exponentially decaying ` radial ' function ( for both branes ) with a damped oscillating one .",
    "the ` radial ' function vanishes far from the branes and diverges logarithmically near the brane core .",
    "the same logarithmic divergence near the brane happens in embedding of  eguchi - hanson metric in m - theory where the divergence is milder than @xmath126  as in the case of embedding taub - nut space .",
    "indeed , all of these properties of our solutions are similar to those previously obtained @xcite for the embedding of eguchi - hanson and taub - nut spaces .",
    "however our solutions have a feature that is quite distinct from these predecessors : they are bolt solutions ( i.e. solutions whose fixed points in the transverse space have maximal dimensionality ) that preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry due to the self - dual hyper - khler character of the atiyah - hitchin metric .",
    "this is in contrast to earlier brane solutions of this type @xcite , for which supersymmetry could only be preserved for nut - like transverse metrics ; their bolt counterparts did not preserve any supersymmetry .",
    "dimensional reduction of the m2 solutions to ten dimensions gives us intersecting iia d2/d6  configurations that preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry .",
    "for the m5 solutions , dimensional reduction yields iians5/d6 brane systems overlapping in five directions .    in the standard case ,",
    "the system of n@xmath254  ns5-branes located at n@xmath255d6-branes can be obtained by dimensional reduction of  n@xmath254n@xmath255coinciding images of m5-branes in the flat transverse geometry . in this case , the worldvolume theory ( the little string theory ) of the iia ns5-branes , in the absence of d6-branes , is a non - local non - gravitational six dimensional theory @xcite . this theory has ( 2,0 ) supersymmetry ( four supercharges in the 4  representation of lorentz symmetry @xmath256 ) and an r - symmetry @xmath257  remnant of the original ten dimensional lorentz symmetry .",
    "the presence of the d6-branes breaks the supersymmetry down to ( 1,0 ) , with eight supersymmetries .",
    "since we found that our solutions preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry , we expect that the theory on ns5-branes is a new little string theory .",
    "we note that in the limit of large @xmath16 , where @xmath121 , the decoupling limits of m2 and m5 atiyah - hitchin based brane solutions are qualitatively the same as what was found in references [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] for corresponding taub - nut based solutions .",
    "although the asymptotic holographic duals of the decoupled theories are known , it would therefore be interesting to find the complete structures of the holographic duals of the decoupled theories .",
    "we leave this for future study .",
    "we note that applying t - duality on our m2 and m5 solutions generates new iib configurations .",
    "for example , by t - dualization along any spatial directions of the ns5 brane , type iia ns5@xmath7d6(5 ) system changes to type iib ns5@xmath7d5(4 ) brane configuration , overlapping in four directions .",
    "the worldvolume theory of the iib ns5-branes , in the absence of d5-branes , is a little string theory with ( 1,1 ) supersymmetry .",
    "the presence of the d5-brane , which has one transverse direction relative to ns5 worldvolume , breaks the supersymmetry down to eight supersymmetries .",
    "this is in good agreement with the number of supersymmetries in 10d iib theory : t - duality preserves the number of original iia supersymmetries , that is eight .",
