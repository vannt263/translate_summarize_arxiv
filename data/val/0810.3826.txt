    "delayed - choice @xcite , quantum eraser walborn-2002 and delayed - choice quantum eraser @xcite experiments  have led to suggestions that interference patterns formed by particles impacting on a screen may be influenced in some way by decisions made long after those particles had landed on that screen .",
    "our objective in this paper is to show by a detailed analysis of various experiments that quantum principles do not support those suggestions .    in our analysis",
    ", we shall make out a case for the adoption of a perception of time in quantum observation different to that used in classical mechanics . to understand what we mean",
    ", it is important to keep a clear distinction between the concepts of _ systems under observation _ ( suos ) , such as photons , and _",
    "apparatus_. our formalism will reflect this difference consistently .",
    "standard unitary schrdinger evolution can be maintained for states of suos in between preparation and outcome , but apparatus appears to follows different rules .",
    "recent quantum experiments walborn-2002,jacques+al-2006,kim+al-2000,kim-2003 are consistent with and support the view that the passage of @xmath0detector time@xmath1 is synonymous with quantum information acquisition occurring in a sequence of _ stages _ @xcite .",
    "stages have rules which are not precisely those of classical information acquisition , and it appears to be this which accounts for much of the well - known difficulty we have in explaining on a classical level various quantum mechanical experiments involving quantum interference .",
    "these rules conform with known physics .",
    "for example , quantum information acquisition never violates the light - cone constraints of relativity : classical information can not be acquired between spacelike intervals .",
    "quantum correlations which appear to violate the principle of einstein locality actually always require observations to be completed before those correlations can be defined , and this completion always takes place in a classically consistent matter .",
    "another rule is that quantum information in the form of suo states _ can _ be shielded against the effects of decoherence and preserved in a state of stasis for arbitrarily long periods of laboratory time .",
    "this is most evident in the heisenberg picture and is confirmed by the observation of light from distant stars and galaxies .",
    "it is also one way to understand particle decay experiments @xcite .",
    "yet another rule is that the observation of different components of entangled states is best discussed in terms of stages rather than linear laboratory time .",
    "this rule is responsible for the apparent acausality in the delayed - choice experiments we are interested in : observations involving separate detectors can be taken in apparently random order relative to laboratory time without affecting correlations .",
    "this was confirmed in the case of the double - slit quantum eraser experiment by walborn et al .",
    "walborn-2002 , who specifically looked at this issue .",
    "our approach uses a formalism that we have developed for the analysis of time - dependent quantum apparatus networks @xcite .",
    "we have recently applied it to the franson - bell experiment franson-1989,kwiat-1993,j2008e , an experiment that appears to involve acausal quantum interference .",
    "in contrast to standard approaches which tend to focus on the quantum mechanics of systems under observation ( suos ) such as photons , our approach focuses on the detecting apparatus as well . this permits a stage - by - stage analysis of the processes involved in typical quantum optics experiments , starting from state preparation , through the various modules making up the apparatus and ending up with the final state detectors .",
    "the formalism is particularly good at giving coincidence rates , which are crucial to many recent quantum optics experiments such as the delayed - choice quantum eraser .",
    "our notation serves two purposes .",
    "first , it provides an efficient method for dealing with quantum networks of great complexity and can be readily encoded into computer algebra packages .",
    "second , it distinguishes between the quantum states of apparatus detectors and those conventionally associated with suos such as photons .",
    "the formalism is completely consistent with all standard quantum principles .",
    "we make a number of standard assumptions throughout our analysis .",
    "first , complete efficiency is assumed , but of course , no real experiment is like that .",
    "however , many experiments show precisely those important quantum features such as interference bands which idealized discussions such as ours predict . because of that",
    ", there is no need to introduce environmental factors such as decoherence into the discussion .",
    "there seems to be no need either to use full - scale quantum field theory in order to draw out the important features of the processes we discuss .    in our analysis",
    "we shall for economy frequently refer to _ photons _ as if they existed in some physical sense as particles",
    ". a better interpretation consistent with our modelling would be in terms of detector signals .",
    "photon spin is then most naturally interpreted in terms of the specific physical properties of photon detectors .",
    "in this section we discuss the double - slit ( ds ) experiment .",
    "this experiment features prominently as a component of the delayed - choice quantum eraser experiment and wheeler s delayed - choice experiment discussed subsequently .",
    "figure @xmath2 shows a schematic diagram representing the main features of the ds experiment .",
    "our notation is as follows .",
    "in such a diagram , @xmath3 represents the labstate @xmath4 of the @xmath5 elementary signal detector located at the indicated place in the apparatus network at stage @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the associated signal creation operator and @xmath8 is the void state of the apparatus @xcite at stage @xmath6 .",
    "a stage can often be identified with a particular moment or period of laboratory time ( i.e. , something approximating an instant of simultaneity in the laboratory rest frame ) , but this need not be the case at all",
    ". in particular , a given stage during a delayed - choice experiment may involve an enormous interval of laboratory time , far beyond any notion of simultaneity .",
    "what is crucial in the definition of a stage is that all the detectors associated with a given stage are _ effectively and mutually spacelike _ relative to each other .",
    "in other words , no information in any form is transmitted between them within that stage .",
    "successive stages are defined in terms of either actual or potential transmission of information between them in either classical and quantum forms .",
    "exactly what this means will be made clearer during our discussion of delayed - choice experiments .    in the ds experiment ,",
    "the source of the photon beam impinging on the double - slit is denoted by @xmath9 in figure @xmath2 , the subscript denoting that it occurs at stage @xmath10 and the superscript denoting that there is a single photon source .",
    "the initial labstate is taken to be of the form @xmath11where @xmath12 is the normalized spin state of the photon concerned and @xmath13 is a complex valued normalization factor related to the initial beam characteristics . in our notation , @xmath14 .",
    "the initial labstate is not normalized to unity because the formalism actually determines _ relative probability rates _ for photon signal production during relevant photon coherence times and related times connected with the passage of wave - trains through the apparatus .",
    "related to this is the requirement for specific contextual information about the apparatus to be taken into account .",
    "for instance , given a very large detecting screen , some of its detectors would signal photon detection much earlier on in a given run than other detectors further way from the slits .",
    "wheeler s delayed - choice experiment is an example where such contextual information is crucial to the discussion @xcite .    in the basic ds experiment , there are no issues with photon spin , so actually the @xmath12 term in ( [ eraser-01 ] ) is redundant here .",
    "however , photon pair spin is a factor in the double - slit quantum eraser experiment discussed later on , so we include a photon spin term here to show how we deal with it in our formalism .    the next step is to compute the effective evolution operator @xmath15 which takes the initial labstate from @xmath16 to @xmath17 in the transition from stage @xmath10 to @xmath18 . referring to figure @xmath2 , we write@xmath19where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are complex coefficients satisfying the rule @xmath22 .",
    "we do not require at this point to have a symmetrical double - slit device , so @xmath20 and @xmath23 are not assumed equal in magnitude .",
    "moreover , each slit could induce a separate phase change in that part of the beam passing through it , so this is left open as well .",
    "the transition from stage @xmath10 to stage @xmath18 involves a change in hilbert space dimension from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , according to the counting rules of our formalism .",
    "however , the effective dimension involved with stage @xmath10 is just @xmath2 and we find@xmath26where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the respective duals of @xmath12 and @xmath9 and @xmath29 denotes @xmath0effective@xmath1 .",
    "the next step is to calculate @xmath30 , the effective evolution operator from @xmath18 to @xmath31 , at which point we have completed our dynamical account of the ds experiment . referring again to figure @xmath2 , we write@xmath32where we have modeled the detecting screen as consisting of a large number @xmath33 of photon detectors .",
    "this accords with actual experiments , which never actually involve a continuum of detectors . if necessary",
    ", we are free to take @xmath34 as large as required in order to model an observed probability pattern to the accuracy required .",
    "note that the detectors in this collection need not be assumed to be coplanar : they could be distributed throughout a three - dimensional region of physical space .",
    "our discussion is perfectly general .",
    "what keeps a track of total probabilities are the semi - unitarity relations between the complex coefficients @xmath35 , which represent the transition amplitudes from emitters based in @xmath18 to detectors in @xmath31 .",
    "these relations take the form@xmath36where @xmath37 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath38 . again , this is perfectly general .",
    "there is no need for our purposes to specify any particular form for the @xmath38 coefficients , provided the basic semi - unitarity conditions ( [ eraser-02 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "it is traditional in standard discussions of the double - slit experiment to solve the schrdinger equation for a monochromatic beam impinging on a screen from two point sources , but this is not necessary in a discussion such as ours : a more general formulation reveals the important features of the experiment more clearly and precisely .    from ( [ eraser-04 ] )",
    "we find the effective transition operator @xmath30 from @xmath18 to @xmath31 to be given by@xmath39the total effective evolution operator @xmath40 is given by the product @xmath41 and is found to be@xmath42    the next step is to calculate the generalized kraus operators @xmath43 , defined by@xmath44 in principle , there are @xmath45 such operators , counting multiple coincidence cases , but in the case of the ds experiment , we know we are dealing with single photon interference .",
    "this means that only the @xmath34 one - signal kraus operators are non - zero , as given by ( [ eraser-03 ] ) and there is one of these for each of the screen detecting sites @xmath46 .",
    "next , we construct the generalized povm elements @xmath47 from the generalized kraus operators . by definition , @xmath48 , where there is no sum over @xmath49 .",
    "we find@xmath50by construction these are all positive operators . as a check on the physical correctness of our formalism , we can use the semi - unitary relations ( eraser-02 ) to show that @xmath51where @xmath52 is the effective identity operator for stage @xmath53 .",
    "the outcome signal rates @xmath54 are defined by @xmath55 and are found to be@xmath56these rates contain the quantum interference contributions expected from quantum principles . using the semi - unitarity relations ( [ eraser-02 ] ) , these rates add up as expected to the beam production rate @xmath57 , as required from probability conservation .",
    "this completes our analysis of the double slit experiment .",
    "we turn now to the delayed - choice quantum eraser .",
    "the basic experiment is shown in figure @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "a photon source @xmath9 sends a beam onto a crystal which is arranged to produce a superposition of coherent photon pairs associated with sites @xmath59 and @xmath60 as shown .",
    "one component of each pair is collimated and passed onto a screen containing detectors @xmath61 , exactly as for the ds experiment discussed in the previous section . in effect , positions @xmath59 and @xmath60 act as a pair of slits for a ds experiment .    in this case",
    ", however , the situation is more complicated . for each pair",
    ", one component is passed into the ds screen whilst the other passes into a prism @xmath62 which deflects it onto a beam - splitter .",
    "component @xmath63 is passed onto beam - splitter @xmath64 whilst component @xmath65 is passed onto beam - splitter @xmath66 . each of these beam - splitters acts on its own incident beam and splits it further into two . in each case , the reflected component is passed onto a photon detector , either at @xmath67 or at @xmath68 , whilst the transmitted component is passed onto a third beam - splitter @xmath69 , where interference takes place , with subsequent detection at @xmath70 and @xmath71    various discussions of this arrangement suggest that choices made by the experimentalist at @xmath69 can influence the interference patterns seen on the screen containing @xmath72 , even though the signals in that screen may have been captured much earlier .",
    "we proceed with our stage analysis as follows . as with the ds experiment",
    ", we represent our initial source at stage @xmath10 by the labstate @xmath73 .",
    "the next stage @xmath74is defined by the production of two correlated photon pairs .",
    "these pairs are each assumed spinless",
    ". the formalism can readily deal with any situation where this is not the case .",
    "the first pair is generated at point @xmath59 on the crystal whilst the other pair is generated at point @xmath60 .",
    "the transformation from @xmath75 is given by@xmath76a_{1}^{1}a_{1}^{2}+",
    "\\notag \\\\ & & \\beta \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[s_{1}^{1,l}s_{1}^{2,r}+s_{1}^{1,r}s_{1}^{2,l}]a_{1}^{3}a_{1}^{4}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath77 and @xmath78 represents the spin state of a left - handed circularly polarized photon moving along direction @xmath79 , and so on . here",
    "terms such as @xmath80 represent the two - signal labstate @xmath81 j2007c .",
    "hence the effective transition operator is@xmath82\\bar{a}_{0}^{1},\\]]where@xmath83\\]]represents an entangled two photon state of total angular momentum zero at stage @xmath6 , @xmath84 .",
    "although individual photon wave components get channeled into four possible directions as shown , the internal total angular moment state remains unaffected during this particular experiment .",
    "the next stage change is from @xmath18 to @xmath31 and given by@xmath85here , one component beam from each pair is focused on the detecting screen whilst the other component is channeled onto either beam - splitter @xmath64 or @xmath66 , as shown .",
    "the @xmath86 represents the amplitudes for landing on the screen from the pair sourced from point @xmath59 , and similarly for the pair sourced from point @xmath60 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath87 are characteristic transmission and reflection parameters associated with @xmath88 .",
    "it is very useful not to set these parameters to the conventional value @xmath89 but to keep them open and available to be changed .",
    "it is in these parameters that we shall encode the observer s freedom of choice in this particular experiment .    from the above we find the effective transition operator",
    "@xmath90.\\end{aligned}\\]]the final transition is from stage @xmath31 to @xmath91 and involves four terms:@xmath92this gives @xmath93.\\end{aligned}\\]]the complete evolution operators is given by @xmath94 . using the above results we find@xmath95a_{3}^{s+2 } \\\\ + [ t_{3}v^{i , a}t_{1}\\alpha + ir_{3}v^{i , b}t_{2}\\beta ] a_{3}^{s+3}\\}\\end{array}\\right\\ } \\bar{a}_{0}^{1}\\text{.}\\ ] ]",
    "there are four kraus operators associated with each detector on the screen , each of the form@xmath96we find@xmath97\\bar{a}_{0}^{1 } ,   \\notag \\\\ m_{3,0}^{i , s+3 } & = s_{3}^{1}\\bar{s}_{0}^{1}[t_{3}v^{i , a}t_{1}\\alpha + ir_{3}v^{i , b}t_{2}\\beta ] \\bar{a}_{0}^{1 } , \\\\",
    "m_{3,0}^{i , s+4 } & = s_{3}^{1}\\bar{s}_{0}^{1}\\beta v^{i , b}ir_{2}\\bar{a}_{0}^{1}. \\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]these give four povms associated with each detector on the screen : @xmath98it is straightforward to check that @xmath99the effective identity operator for the initial stage hilbert space .",
    "there are four coincidence rates @xmath100 associated with each detector on the screen , involving one of the detectors @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "these rates are defined by@xmath103we findlatexmath:[\\ ] ]    from this we find the kraus operators@xmath192and then the povms@xmath193hence the two coincidence transition rate patterns are given by@xmath194these now show interference , with one showing what would normally be described as a _",
    "pattern whilst the other showing an _ antifringe _ pattern . essentially , the insertion of the polarizer in front of the @xmath153 photon detector erases the which - path information which previously gave a non - interference pattern on the screen .",
    "most significantly , walborn et al repeated the experiment with the screen and @xmath153 photon detection order reversed with significant time differences and found no change in the results .",
    "this is strong evidence for the validity of the stages concept in such quantum process .",
    "our analysis supports the notion that quantum mechanics never actually involves acausality .",
    "we should be worried if it did , for then our entire view of what probability and information represent would need drastic revision .",
    "however , several factors would appear to conspire to make it look otherwise .",
    "it is the case that some quantum interference experiments do suggest acausality to the unwary .",
    "we have in mind here not only the delayed - choice scenarios discussed here but also the franson - bell experiment franson-1989,kwiat-1993,j2008e . in that experiment , the lack of which - path information involves non - locality in time as well as non - locality in space in a most spectacular fashion .",
    "however , detailed analysis always reveals the basic fact that interference phenomena arise from a lack of information about quantum _",
    "states _ and have nothing specifically to do with the properties of particles per se",
    ". it may be reasonable to talk about @xmath0photon self - interference@xmath1 when we know we are dealing with one - signal experiments , but as the franson - bell experiment and more recent ones demonstrate @xcite , two - photon state interference occurs under circumstances when individual photons simply do not @xmath0overlap@xmath1 .",
    "conceptual problems arise when our classical conditioning is relied on too much .",
    "we would like to believe in photons as particles and we would like to believe that time runs continuously .",
    "both concepts have their uses , but quantum mechanics requires a generalization of both . in the case of the former ,",
    "experiments tell us that we have to deal with interference of states not particles . in the case of the latter",
    ", we can not expect quantum processes to evolve strictly according to an integrable timetable , such as coordinate time , or even the physical time in a laboratory .",
    "what is important is whether or not quantum information has been extracted .",
    "if it has been placed @xmath0on hold@xmath1 , as can be seen in our analysis of the delayed - choice eraser and the double - slit eraser , then it can remain in a stage which could in principle persist until the end of the universe .",
    "this is one way of understanding unstable particles @xcite : an undecayed unstable particle is one trapped in an information bubble .",
