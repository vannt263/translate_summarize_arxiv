    "the interaction of energetic particles with the solar wind is a topic of wide interest in space physics and astrophysics .",
    "several varieties of charged particles populate the heliosphere , including energetic particles originating at the sun ( solar energetic particles , or seps ) and galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) that enter the heliosphere uniformly and nearly isotropically from the outside @xcite . these cosmic rays ( crs )",
    "are strongly guided and scattered by the solar wind and the turbulent fluctuations that transport with it @xcite .",
    "as such , the study of the origin and transport of cosmic rays is an important problem in heliospheric physics , with implications ranging from space weather and exploration to fundamental space plasma physics @xcite .",
    "the effects of these energetic particles on the health of astronauts @xcite and the well - being of electronic components in spacecraft @xcite are an immediate concern .",
    "in addition , the accuracy with which we can understand cr propagation also provides a testbed for energetic particle transport in numerous space and astrophysical applications @xcite .",
    "the solar wind provides us with an opportunity to observe , at close range , the behavior of energetic particles in random , turbulent magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "such fields are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems @xcite , and the insights we glean from studies of crs in the heliosphere can potentially find application elsewhere in the universe . finally , observations of cosmic rays can also serve as probes into solar activity and solar wind structure , as cr variations are seen to be correlated with solar and geomagnetic activity @xcite",
    ".    theories of the modulation of cosmic rays in the heliosphere attempt to explain the observed temporal and spatial variation in their spectra @xcite , and for that purpose , require a knowledge of the cosmic ray diffusion tensor .",
    "in fact , one of the key challenges in solving the parker cr transport equation @xcite is the inadequate knowledge of the spatial , temporal , and rigidity dependence of the components of the diffusion tensor . in turn",
    ", the specification of this tensor through the heliosphere requires an understanding of two topics .",
    "first , a theoretical understanding of the diffusion process itself is needed , which would lead to predictions of the structure of the diffusion tensor itself .",
    "equally important is the knowledge of the large scale flows and electromagnetic field in the plasma , and the distribution of background solar wind turbulence in which the particles are scattered .",
    "the present approach permits three dimensional , and ( in principle ) time - varying calculation of all three of these properties ( diffusion tensor , large scale flow , large scale electromagnetic field ) to be computed in a single model .",
    "the formal structure of the diffusion tensor involves diagonal components corresponding to diffusion parallel and perpendicular to the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) , as well as off - diagonal components describing perpendicular drifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while quasi - linear theory @xcite extended to include time - dependent and non - linear corrections @xcite provides a relatively good accounting of parallel diffusion , theories of perpendicular diffusion have faced the challenge of accounting for non - linear effects such as transfer of particles across field lines , backscatter from parallel diffusion , and field - line random walk @xcite . the non - linear guiding center ( nlgc )",
    "theory ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) accounts for the above , and is further improved by the random ballistic interpretation of @xcite . in the current work we focus on the parallel and perpendicular and diffusion coefficients ; the drift motion could be a topic for future work .",
    "since turbulent fluctuations are responsible for scattering crs , the diffusion theories mentioned above typically involve turbulence parameters such as the energy of the random magnetic fluctuations and correlation scales . in the solar wind",
    ", low - frequency turbulence evolves via a non - linear cascade , while also being transported and processed by the large - scale radially expanding solar wind . at all but",
    "the smallest scales , these processes are well described by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models @xcite . over the years",
    ", turbulence models have incorporated simplifying assumptions relevant to the solar wind , yielding increased tractability of the governing equations @xcite .",
    "the increased sophistication of the models and improvements in computational power have led to numerical simulations yielding good agreement with _",
    "voyager , ulysses _ , and _ wind _ observations @xcite .",
    "these turbulence models have also been used to study the propagation of coronal mass ejections @xcite .",
    "our strategy for evaluating the cr diffusion coefficients through the inner heliosphere consists of two steps : first , specification of the relevant turbulence parameters based on a global solar wind model , and second , evaluation of the cr diffusion coefficients using the specified heliographic distribution of turbulence . for the first step",
    ", we deduce turbulence parameters from a global , three - dimensional ( 3-d ) mhd simulation of the solar wind @xcite",
    ".    the spatial resolution that can be realistically achieved in such simulations can not resolve the small - scale fluctuations that cause scattering of crs .",
    "for instance , the spatial resolution of our simulation , at 1 au , can be estimated as roughly 0.03 au . however , the mean free path , at 1 au , for scattering perpendicular to the mean magnetic field has been estimated to be as low as 0.001 au @xcite , and the correlation scale of the turbulence has been estimated to be around 0.007 au @xcite .",
    "this is where our turbulence model for the  sub - resolution \" physics comes in .",
    "our simulation explicitly resolves the large - scale , mean solar wind bulk flow , which is coupled to the small - scale inhomogeneities by means of an mhd - reynolds - averaged navier - stokes ( rans ; see , for example , @xcite ) model for the random fluctuations .",
    "the simulation has been well - tested , and gives reasonable agreement with many spacecraft observations of large - scale solar wind fields , turbulence parameters ( energy , cross helicity and correlation scale ) , as well as the temperature , for varying heliocentric distance , and where feasible , varying helio - latititude @xcite . in recent",
    " applied \" work , the simulation has been used to study the collisional age of the solar wind plasma @xcite , and we view the present work as a continuation of such application - oriented studies .",
    "once the turbulence parameters are specified through the model heliosphere , for the second step of our calculation , we use , as a starting point , fairly standard , well - tested formalisms for parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients - quasi - linear theory @xcite to compute the parallel component of the diffusion tensor , and the random ballistic decorrelation ( rbd ) interpretation of nlgc theory @xcite for perpendicular diffusion .",
    "previous studies of the heliographic dependence of the cr diffusion coefficients include work based on both wkb models for alfvn waves @xcite , and models for strong turbulence @xcite .",
    "the present work builds on these studies , but also makes some significant departures , motivated and enabled by recent advances in diffusion theory and sophistication of solar wind simulations .",
    "the major points of departure from previous work are listed below :    \\1 .",
    "we use a fully 3-d global simulation of the solar wind that provides us with a reliable and self - consistent model heliosphere .",
    "previous work has used one - dimensional ( 1-d ) radial evolution models with spherical symmetry , with shear - driving effects included through a model @xcite .",
    "thus , while examining latitudinal dependence of the diffusion tensor , these studies implicitly assume that they are far from regions with significant latitudinal gradients .",
    "in contrast , three dimensionality improves the physical authenticity of the simulation by explicitly including shear - driving effects on the flow across latitudes , and leads to improved data - visualization through two - dimensional ( 2-d ) contour plots .",
    "a similar 3-d approach has been recently used in @xcite to study the propagation of gcrs from 0.3 au to the termination shock .",
    "the computation of the cr diffusion tensor requires specification of the background solar wind speed , and the underlying large - scale heliospheric magnetic field .",
    "previous work @xcite used a radially constant solar wind speed with some latitudinal variation , and a parker - spiral type magnetic field model .",
    "however , the use of a prescribed model for the background fields has been found inadequate @xcite , and instead we use the large - scale , resolved flow from our mhd - rans simulation .",
    "this provides a complete specification of the background large - scale fields , with spatial variation that has been found to agree well with observations @xcite .",
    "we examine the diffusion coefficients at radial distances between 2 @xmath5 and 3 au , where @xmath5 denotes a solar radius .",
    "we are not aware of any other similar study that has probed regions this close to the sun , which are of prime interest for sep propagation , space weather , and for upcoming spacecraft missions , including solar probe plus . resolving this entire domain ( @xmath0 au ) in one simulation",
    "is a challenge , as modeling approximations that are appropriate very close to the sun may not be valid at larger heliocentric distances .",
    "furthermore , the time - scales associated with the different domains are disparate @xcite .",
    "we use an approach where the computational domain is split into three regions : inner ( @xmath6 ) , intermediate ( @xmath7 ) , and outer ( @xmath8 au ) .",
    "the inner and intermediate regions employ a wkb alfvn wave model , and the outer region solves a full turbulence transport model , with the inner boundary conditions for each region being provided by the preceding one @xcite .",
    "a magnetic dipole with its tilt ( relative to the solar rotation axis ) varying through the solar activity cycle is a first and rough approximation for the solar magnetic field .",
    "we examine the effect of changing the tilt of the source solar dipole by using simulations with a dipole untilted with respect to the solar rotation axis , and a dipole with 30 tilt , in contrast to previous work employing axisymmetric solar wind parameters @xcite .",
    "the tilt of the solar dipole and the warping of the helispheric current sheet @xcite indicate high levels of solar activity @xcite , which is a factor of interest since cr intensity is anticorrelated to solar activity levels @xcite .",
    "we note here that previous work that examined the effect of solar activity on cr - intensity variation @xcite did not include turbulence modeling , and here we examine how varying turbulence levels influence the diffusion coefficients .",
    "the perpendicular diffusion coefficient has been previously evaluated using the  bam \" model @xcite by @xcite , and the nlgc theory @xcite by @xcite .",
    "recently , the nlgc theory has been reinterpreted by @xcite , and their rbd theory yields a significantly improved agreement with numerical experiments , for magnetic fluctuation amplitudes comparable to the large - scale magnetic field .",
    "this makes it very well suited for application to the solar wind , where the imf includes a strong fluctuating component @xcite , and we use the rbd theory to derive a new expression for the perpendicular diffusion coefficient .    \\6 . with the above improvements , the present approach departs significantly from both sep studies ( for example , @xcite ) and gcr modulation studies ( for example , @xcite ) that have used relatively simplified assumptions in one or more of the above categories , such as semiempirical diffusion coefficients and simple scalings with magnetic field magnitude .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we describe the form of the cr diffusion tensor in section 2 , and briefly discuss the turbulence model and the simulation in section 3 .",
    "section 4 presents the heliographic distribution of the diffusion coefficients . in an appendix",
    "we briefly describe how other types of diffusion coefficients might be estimated using similar approaches .",
    "the cr diffusion tensor , @xmath9 , describes the scattering of crs by random fluctuations in the imf .",
    "it may be expressed as @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mean imf , @xmath12 is the kronecker delta , and @xmath13 is the levi - civita symbol .",
    "this work presents calculations of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which are the diagonal components of the diffusion tensor parallel and perpendicular , respectively , to the mean imf .",
    "the present work does not calculate @xmath16 , which can describe particle drifts under the influence of large - scale gradients and curvature in the imf .",
    "our results are directly relevant to the outward propagation of seps , for which @xmath14 and @xmath15 are needed to describe how the sep distribution spreads in the parallel and perpendicular directions , whereas over the short time scale of the sep outflow the drifts may mainly shift the lateral distribution over a small angle .",
    "the lateral distribution of particle injection is often unknown , and the effects of drifts are often neglected , though @xcite argue that they should be considered .",
    "both diffusion and drifts are considered to be important to the modulation of gcr with the solar cycle and the small gradients in gcr density @xcite , though these processes take place over a wider region than considered in the present work ( @xmath17 au ) .",
    "we shall also examine the radial diffusion coefficient @xmath18 which is of particular relevance to models of solar modulation of crs .",
    "here , @xmath19 is the  winding \" angle between the imf and the radial direction . following previous work ,",
    "we define mean free paths , @xmath20 , that are equivalent to the diffusion tensor through @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the particle speed .",
    "we note that in the present work we use the large - scale flow from our simulation to specify @xmath23 and @xmath19 as spatially varying fields through the 3-d heliosphere .",
    "this is in contrast to previous studies @xcite , where @xmath23 and @xmath19 were specified through a parker - type model and a radially constant solar wind speed ( to compute @xmath19 ) .",
    "however , the features of the imf have a major influence on cr transport , and a parker - type field is an oversimplification , particularly at high heliolatitudes ( see @xcite for an overview of suggested modifications to the parker field ) .",
    "moreover , the use of a - priori prescribed background fields in modulation studies has been held responsible for restricting the diffusion tensor to values that preclude agreement of models with observations @xcite , and the present work makes a significant improvement in this regard .      in determining the parallel mean free path ( mfp ) , the turbulence  geometry \" , i.e. , the distribution of energy over parallel and perpendicular wavevectors , is a controlling factor .",
    "observations @xcite show that a pure  slab \" model of heliospheric turbulence @xcite underestimates the parallel mfp . in the slab model ,",
    "the magnetic fluctuations are polarized perpendicular to the mean field and their wave - vectors are parallel to the mean field .",
    "@xcite find that a composite model with a dominant 2-d part ( fluctuations and their wave - vectors both perpendicular to the mean field ) and a minor slab part provides a better approximate parametrization of the turbulence and an improved description of the observed mean free paths .",
    "furthermore , theoretical studies and observations @xcite suggest that around 80% of magnetic fluctuation energy in the inertial range should reside in 2-d component , with the rest in the slab component .    in the following ,",
    "we take the @xmath24-component along the mean field . considering parallel diffusion first",
    ", we note that in quasilinear theory the 2-d fluctuations are effectively invisible to crs resonating with the turbulence , and the scattering by slab fluctuations ( assumed to be axisymmetric ) is described by the parallel mfp @xcite",

    "equation [ eq : mfp_p ] is valid at rigidities ranging from from 10 mv to 10 gv @xcite .",
    "perpendicular diffusion is often not considered as important as parallel diffusion in energetic particle studies , because it is usually inferred that @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found that for strong particle enhancements related to corotating interaction regions , @xmath39 rose to @xmath40 in the fast solar wind stream arriving after the stream interface .",
    "using data from the _ ulysses _ spacecraft during the sep event of 2000 jul 14 , @xcite inferred @xmath41 .",
    "our 3-d model inner heliosphere provides an opportunity to examine the domains where perpendicular diffusion can be comparable with parallel diffusion .",
    "quasi - linear theory @xcite provides a physically appealing description of perpendicular diffusion in terms of the diffusive spread of magnetic field lines , with the gyrocenters of charged particles following the field lines .",
    "other approaches have considered the relationship between @xmath15 and @xmath14 , and applied the taylor - green - kubo formulation ( bam , @xcite ) to the problem",
    ". however , the field line random walk ( flrw ) approach @xcite overestimates the strength of the diffusion , while bam predicts diffusion that is weaker than that observed in numerical experiments @xcite .",
    "the nlgc theory @xcite accounts for both the random walk of the field lines and the influence of parallel scattering , and shows good agreement with both observations @xcite and simulations , with the nlgc results bracketed by the flrw and bam results @xcite .",
    "recent work @xcite has reinterpreted nlgc by replacing the diffusion of gyrocenter trajectories with a random ballistic decorrelation ( rbd ) , where the guiding center motion is approximated as ballistic ( i.e. , with constant velocity ) between scattering events . the rbd - modified theory agrees with numerical simulations over a wider range of fluctuation amplitudes than the original nlgc , specifically for fluctuations comparable in size to the large - scale field .",
    "this makes it particularly suited for application to the solar wind @xcite .",
    "other improvements to nlgc have also been developed ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the phenomenon of  backtracking \" due to parallel scattering causes a particle to reverse its motion along the field line , thus retracing its steps over a certain time - span .",
    "this leads to a negative @xmath42-correlation ( @xmath42 being a component of the particle s velocity perpendicular to the mean field ) , which results in a reduction in the running perpendicular diffusion coefficient . with this backtracking correction , rbd yields the following perpendicular diffusion coefficient @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath22 is the particle speed , @xmath45 is the @xmath46-component of the guiding center velocity , @xmath47 is the 2-d axisymmetric turbulent fluctuation spectrum , erfc is the complementary error function , and @xmath48 is the component of the wave - vector perpendicular to the mean magnetic field .",
    "we also have @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the combined variance of the 2-d and slab magnetic fluctuations : @xmath52 .",
    "note that in equation [ eq : rbd ] , the slab turbulence spectrum does not appear .",
    "this is because we follow the suggestion by that the direct contribution of the slab component to perpendicular transport is subdiffusive , and therefore the slab term should not contribute to equation [ eq : rbd ] . this hypothesis has been supported by simulations @xcite , and accordingly , has been adopted in the present work as well .",
    "slab fluctuations can , however , still influence @xmath15 through @xmath14 , which appears in equation [ eq : alpha ] for @xmath53 , and @xmath54",
    ".    the 2-d power spectrum may be expressed as a power law @xcite @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the 2-d correlation scale , @xmath58 is a normalization constant , @xmath59 is the variance of the 2-d turbulent fluctuations , and @xmath60 is a power index that takes on integral values that correspond to different power spectra . we assume a kolmogorov spectrum in the inertial range by taking @xmath61 . from the requirement",
    "that @xmath62 , we get @xmath63    note that the inertial range ( @xmath64 ) behavior is described by a conventional power law , and @xmath60 only determines the long - wavelength properties of the spectrum .",
    "the spectral behavior of interplanetary magnetic fluctuations at long wavelengths is not well determined from single point measurements @xcite , and there are ambiguities surrounding the question of whether the observed structures are spatial or temporal in origin . the observations of ",
    "@xmath65 \" noise at low frequencies also complicate matters @xcite .",
    "all values of @xmath66 yield power spectra that give rise to a finite energy , but these spectra may be differentiated based on the characteristic length scales associated with them .",
    "in addition to the standard correlation scale @xcite , there is a distinct scale , called the ultrascale , which is of importance in applications of 2-d turbulence ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the ultrascale is so named because it is generally larger than the correlation scale , and it may be interpreted as a typical size of an  island \" of 2-d turbulence @xcite and as the perpendicular coherence length of the flrw @xcite .",
    "we consider the following cases @xcite : @xmath67 ( infinite correlation scale and an infinite ultrascale ) , @xmath68 ( finite correlation scale but an infinite ultrascale ) , and @xmath69 ( finite ultrascale and finite correlation scale ) .",
    "the case @xmath70 is of special interest since it corresponds to homogeneous turbulence .",
    "each of the above possibilities is realizable as each yields a finite energy .",
    "however , unlike the correlation scale , the values taken by the ultrascale in space and",
    "astrophysical plasmas are not well known , and there is a paucity of established methods to measure it ( see @xcite for a proposed technique ) .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to examine the dependence of the diffusion coefficients on @xmath60 .",
    "if there is a marked differentiation between the mfps computed for different cases , then observations of the mfps may be used to infer constraints on the ultrascales prevailing in the heliospheric plasma .    to finally obtain an expression for the perpendicular mean free path , we use equations [ eq : twod1 ] and [ eq : twod2 ] in equation [ eq : rbd ] and set @xmath71 to get    @xmath72     \\\\                & + \\delta_{p,-1 } \\lambda_2 \\bigg [ \\mathscr{f}_2 \\lambda_2 \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi } }   \\tensor[_2]{\\text{f}}{_2 } \\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2};\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{3}{2};-\\mathscr{f}_2 ^ 2 \\lambda_2 ^ 2 \\right )    \\\\               & -0.981755 - \\log ( \\mathscr{f}_2 \\lambda_2 ) \\bigg ]    \\\\               & + ( 1-\\delta_{p,-1})\\frac{\\lambda_2}{p+1 } \\bigg[\\text{erfc}(\\mathscr{f}_2 \\lambda_2 ) \\\\               & - \\frac{\\mathscr{f}_2 \\lambda_2}{\\sqrt{\\pi } }                e_{\\frac{p}{2}+1}(\\mathscr{f}_2 ^ 2 \\lambda_2 ^ 2 ) \\bigg ] \\bigg\\ } ,              \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath73 and @xmath74 in equation [ eq : mfp_perp ] , erf is the error function",

    "<S> we use a three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the solar wind to calculate cosmic ray diffusion coefficients throughout the inner heliosphere ( @xmath0 au ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation resolves large - scale solar wind flow , which is coupled to small - scale fluctuations through a turbulence model . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results specify background solar wind fields and turbulence parameters , which are used to compute diffusion coefficients and study their behavior in the inner heliosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the parallel mean free path is evaluated using quasi - linear theory , while the perpendicular mean free path is determined by non - linear guiding center theory with the random ballistic interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> several runs examine varying turbulent energy and different solar source dipole tilts . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for most of the inner heliosphere , the radial mean free path ( mfp ) is dominated by diffusion parallel to the mean magnetic field ; the parallel mfp remains at least an order of magnitude larger than the perpendicular mfp , except in the heliospheric current sheet , where the perpendicular mfp may be a few times larger than the parallel mfp ; in the ecliptic region , the perpendicular mfp may influence the radial mfp at heliocentric distances larger than 1.5 au ; our estimations of the parallel mfp in the ecliptic region at 1 au agree well with the palmer  consensus \" range of @xmath1 au ; solar activity increases perpendicular diffusion and reduces parallel diffusion ; the parallel mfp varies with rigidity @xmath2 as @xmath3 , and the perpendicular mfp is weakly dependent on @xmath4 ; the mfps are weakly influenced by the choice of long wavelength power spectra . </S>"
