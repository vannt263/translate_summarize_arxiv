    "( 150mm,100mm)fig2.eps    by identifying the true superhump period , we have been able to trace back the cycle counts and identified that the superhump period was longer during the earlier half of the rebrightening phase .",
    "the times of superhumps maxima and other information will be listed in our next summary paper on su uma - type dwarf novae ( kato et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the pattern of period variation looks unusual for a wz sge - type dwarf nova in that the period showed a systematic decrease ( figure [ fig : j1222humpall ] ) , while the superhump period usually increase in most of wz sge - type dwarf novae ( e.g. figure 89 of @xcite ) .",
    "helped by the new finding and interpretation for the period variation of the superhumps in the growing stage ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , however , we can now interpret that we observed unusually long - lasting stage a superhumps which switched to stage b superhumps in the middle of the rebrightening ( see @xcite for the description of stages a ",
    "c ; while stages a  c usually refer to the superhumps during the main superoutburst , the present stage a and b superhumps were recorded during the rebrightening ) .",
    "the growth of the superhump amplitude during the rebrightening indicates that these superhumps are not a result of the remaining eccentricity but reflect the newly excited eccentric instability .",
    "stage a superhumps lasted at least for 150 cycles ( it may be even closer to 200 cycles if we assume the start of stage b at the @xmath11 maximum ) .",

    "although individual times of maxima were not well determined due to the faintness of the object , a pdm analysis of the later post - rebrightening period ( bjd 24563482456369 ) yielded a period of 0.07676(4 )  d. we adopted an averaged value 0.07673(3 )  d of the two methods .",
    "this long superhump period appears to be consistent with late - stage superhumps in some wz sge - type dwarf novae ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    according to the crts sss data , the object remained @xmath71 mag brighter than in quiescence even after 82  d of the initial crts detection ( 98  d after the initial master detection ) .",
    "such a long - lasting fading tail is characteristic to a wz sge - type dwarf nova .",
    "as shown in subsection [ sec : sh ] it took 150200 cycles to fully evolve the superhumps . because of this very slow evolution of superhumps , the stage a  b transition , which usually occurs shortly after the outburst in ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae , occurred in the middle of the rebrightening and produced a peculiar @xmath11 pattern .",
    "this phenomenon can be naturally understood assuming a very small mass ratio and very long growth time of the 3:1 resonance , which is expected to be inversely proportional to @xmath20 @xcite , and the superhump wave was confined to the 3:1 region for a long time due to the very small tidal effect .",
    "the growth time of superhumps in sss j122221 was 57 times longer than typical short - period su uma - type dwarf novae ( cf .",

    "assuming a typical @xmath3=0.100.15 for short - period ( @xmath21  d ) su uma - type dwarf novae , we can expect @xmath22 for this object .",
    "it was very unfortunate that there was no chance for time - resolved photometry during the initial outburst which is supposed to show early superhumps [ double - wave modulations in the early stage of wz sge - type outbursts , whose period is very close to the orbital period ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    despite the evidence for a rather high inclination from spectroscopy",
    ", we could not detect any orbital signal in the post - rebrightening phase or the faint state before the rebrightening .",
    "we therefore can not directly apply the determination of @xmath3 using the stage a @xmath23 method @xcite .",
    "we can put , however , a certain constraint .",
    "the outline of the method is as follows .",
    "the precession rate of the elongated accretion disk , which is the origin of the superhumps , can be determined by a combination of the dynamical precession rate , pressure effect , and the minor wave - wave interaction term ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the pressure effect produces a retrograde precession , and reduces the precession rate .",
    "this effect can become negligible when the superhump wave is still confined to the radius of the 3:1 resonance ( growing stage of superhumps , observationally known as stage a superhumps ) or when the disk is cold ( post - superoutburst stage ) . during the growing stage of superhumps ,",
    "the precession rate is suggested to be equal to the purely dynamical precession rate at the radius of the 3:1 resonance @xcite and this has been confirmed by a comparison with the objects with known mass ratios dynamically determined or determined by quiescent eclipses @xcite .",
    "the dynamical precession rate , @xmath24 in the disk can be expressed by ( see , @xcite ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the angular orbital frequency and the dimensionless radius measured in units of the binary separation @xmath28 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath3 and @xmath27 are @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the laplace coefficient @xmath32 this @xmath33 is equivalent to the fractional superhump excess ( in frequency ) @xmath34 and it is related to the conventional fractional superhump excess ( in period ) @xmath35 by a relation @xmath36 .",
    "we can now express fractional superhump excesses ( in frequency unit ) of stage a superhumps and post - superoutburst superhumps as follows : @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the radius of the 3:1 resonance @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the fractional superhump excess and disk radius immediately after the outburst , respectively . by solving equations ( [ equ : epsstagea ] ) and ( [ equ : epspost ] ) simultaneously ,",
    "we can obtain the relation between @xmath42 and @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath42 is expected to be smaller than @xmath39 and larger than the circularization radius ( 0.20 @xmath28 for @xmath43 and 0.14 @xmath28 for @xmath44 , @xcite ) , we can put a constraint on the @xmath3 value .",
    "we can put a more stringent constraint on @xmath3 by using experimentally derived @xmath42 values . according to @xcite , the disk radius of wz sge - type dwarf novae after the superoutburst ( and associated rebrightenings )",
    "was estimated to be 0.370.38 @xmath28 for objects without rebrightenings and 0.300.32 @xmath28 for objects with multiple rebrightenings .",
    "if we assume a range of @xmath45 , the @xmath3 range is @xmath46 ( corresponding to a range of acceptable orbital period of 0.076120.07650  d ) .",
    "this makes sss j122221 one of the smallest @xmath3 known in hydrogen - rich cvs ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and it is the smallest @xmath3 estimated other than from fractional superhump excess of stage b superhumps , which is not a good estimator due to the strong pressure effect ( see @xcite ) . since sss j122221",
    "does not show helium enhancement ( e.g. @xcite ) , this object is unlikely a core - stripped compact binary similar to sbs 1108@xmath47574 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . given the long @xmath4 and low @xmath3 , this object is a perfect candidate for a period bouncer .",
    "an analysis of the crts data in quiescence around this range of the orbital period yielded a possible period of 0.075879(1 )  d ( figure [ fig : j122221porbpdm ] ) .",
    "this signal was present in an interval bjd 24535002454500 , but became weaker in an interval bjd 24545002455500 .",
    "this candidate photometric period may not be stable and needs to be tested by further observations .",
    "if this period is the orbital period , it corresponds to @xmath23=0.017 for stage a superhumps and yields @xmath2 .",
    "the disk radius in the post - superoutburst phase can be estimated to be 0.40 @xmath28 .",
    "although this radius is larger than in other wz sge - type dwarf novae , a very small @xmath3 may be responsible . as described in @xcite the disk radius at the end of the superoutburst",
    "is a measure of the tidal strength and @xcite even assumed 0.42 @xmath28 for a low-@xmath3 object .",
    "@xcite proposed a similar idea of decoupling between the thermal and tidal instability in low-@xmath3 systems .",
    "we therefore consider the radius of 0.40 @xmath28 will not be unexpectedly large .",
    "the identification of the true orbital period is wanted .",
    "the peculiar pattern of a double superoutburst in sss j122221 is not unprecedented . ot j184228.1@xmath47483742 (",
    "= pnv j18422792@xmath474837425 ; hereafter ot j184228 ) showed a similar double superoutburst @xcite .",
    "the initial superoutburst in ot j184228 only consisted of early superhumps and ( ordinary ) superhumps only grew during the second superoutburst ( rebrightening ) .",

    "@xcite considered that the low @xmath3 and resulting long growth time of the 3:1 resonance gives rise to this peculiar pattern of the outburst .",
    "although we used `` superoutburst '' for the first outburst referring to its duration , the first outburst may bear characteristic of a prolonged precursor outburst whose long duration is sustained by the viscous depletion of the large amount of stored mass ( as in the initial part of the `` case b '' outburst in @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also suggested @xmath3=0.042(3 ) for ot j184228 from stage a superhumps .",
    "these two objects indeed appear to be very alike .",
