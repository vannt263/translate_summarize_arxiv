    "@xcite ) . however , it is well known since the discovery of interstellar polarization ( hiltner  @xcite ; hall  @xcite ; dombrovski  @xcite ) that the non - spherical grains should exist in the interstellar medium .",
    "the first and single attempt to study the shape effects on grain temperature was made by greenberg & shah  ( @xcite ) .",

    "their conclusion that non - spherical particles are about 10% cooler than spheres is the result even included in textbooks ( see whittet  @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation of the dust temperature is an essential step in any modelling of infrared ( ir ) emission from dust shells and discs , interstellar clouds , and galaxies .",
    "the dust temperature is included into the expressions for the determination of dust mass and cooling processes .",
    "the temperature of particles is also important for the process of molecule formation on grains .    in this letter",

    "such particles emit more radiation at long wavelengths where the imaginary part of the refractive index @xmath34 is large and increases significantly with wavelength ( excluding ac1 ) . in comparison with other materials presented in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , the iron particles absorb much more radiation at visual wavelengths . for intermediate values of @xmath9 ,",
    "the emissive capacity of spheroids is almost the same as for spheres and therefore spheroids have larger temperatures .",
    "this explains the peculiar curves for iron in fig .",
    "note also that for extremely prolate or oblate particles the decrease of the temperature with the growth @xmath9 ceases .",

    "the behaviour of @xmath34 for all silicates is rather similar and the values of @xmath34 in the ir are usually smaller than for materials with metallic properties . as a result ,",

    "[ f1 ] .",
    "the behaviour similar to described above is kept when the incident radiation is slightly polarized ( @xmath39 ) or its spectral distribution changes due to attenuation of the uv field and other components in eq .",
    "( [ isrf ] ) . in both cases",
    "the relative changes of the ratio of temperatures remain in the limits smaller than 5% .",
    "the alignment of dust grains does not affect strongly the temperature of non - spherical interstellar grains .",
    "its influence becomes more important for particles immersed in an anisotropic radiation field like in circumstellar shells ( especially in the case of oblate grains , see voshchinnikov & semenov  @xcite for discussion ) .",
    "a similar situation exists near the the edges of dark interstellar clouds . for a fixed @xmath12 the difference in temperatures of porous spherical and non - spherical particles is smaller than for compact ones .",
    "the temperature of interstellar dust grains can be found by fitting the galactic ir emission by modified blackbody curves .",
    "the dust emission spectrum obtained from cobe data for dust associated with hi gas can be represented by a single modified blackbody curve with @xmath40 ( boulanger et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to compare the observationally - based emissivity law with dust models , the shape , size , and porosity distribution of the particles have to be taken into account .",
    "it is not the goal of this paper to perform such an analysis , but to provide necessary input data . from table  1",
    ", it can be clearly seen that the temperature of refractory spheroidal grains with @xmath41 ranges between 12.1k and 15.7k , lower than predicted by the observations .",
    "the steady - state temperature of grains also dictates the efficiency of the process of molecule formation on grain surfaces . as it is shown by pirronello et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the decrease of a grain temperature by 20  30% can enhance the efficiency of hydrogen recombination by 2  4 times .",
    "in the conditions typical of the interstellar radiation field the temperature of the non - spherical ( spheroidal ) grains deviates from that of spheres of the same volume less than 10% if the aspect ratios @xmath0 .",
    "more elongated or flattened particles are usually cooler than spheres and in some cases the temperatures may differ by a factor 2 and more .",
    "the shape effects are almost independent of particle size but increase with the growth of the material absorption in the infrared ( i.e. , they are more important for carbonaceous and metallic particles than for silicates and ices ) . in dark interstellar clouds the non - spherical particles",
    "will be cooler than spheres , facilitating the molecule formation on grain surfaces .",
