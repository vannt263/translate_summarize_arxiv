    "there has been a great deal of interest in the study of pentaquarks and a large number of experiments have been carried out [ 1 - 11 ] .",
    "the existence of pentaquarks is uncertain since they have been seen in some experiments and not in others .",
    "various groups hope to clarify this situation by performing more precise experimental searches .",
    "the @xmath0 which decays to a kaon and a nucleon has been seen in several experiments .",
    "it has been interpreted as a pentaquark with a @xmath1 structure [ 12 ] .",
    "a pentaquark @xmath2 with the assumed structure @xmath3 has also been observed recently .",
    "a recent review may be found in ref . [ 13 ] .",
    "we were particularly interested in the diquark - triquark model of karliner and lipkin which has been applied in the study of pentaquarks [ 14,15 ] , and we have made use of a variant of that model in our work [ 16,17 ] .",
    "one problem for the theorist has been the very small widths of the observed pentaquarks .",
    "we have studied that question in a relativistic diquark - triquark model and found we could explain the small widths seen in experiment [ 16,17 ] . in our model , as in that of refs . [",
    "14,15 ] , the pentaquark is described as scalar diquark coupled to a triquark .",
    "[ see fig.1 . ]",
    "using the insight gained in our analysis of the nucleon , which made use of a quark - diquark model [ 18 ] , we took the scalar diquark mass to be 400 mev in our study of the pentaquark .",
    "there have been many studies of diquark structure making use of the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model .",
    "some of that work is reviewed in ref . [ 19 ] .",
    "one may suggest that , in addition to studies of diquark structure , a study of triquark structure may be of interest . in our earlier work the triquark mass was taken to be 800 mev on phenomenological grounds .",
    "we note that a calculation of triquark properties , using the operator product expansion and including direct instanton contributions , obtained a triquark of @xmath4 structure of mass 800 mev [ 20 ] .",
    "an additional triquark state was found at 900 mev in ref . [",
    "( another work making use of qcd sum rules yields quite small values for the width of the @xmath0 pentaquark [ 21 ] . )    once we decide to study triquark structure , we face the following problem .",
    "the triquark of mass 800 mev is very close to the threshold for decay to a 400 mev diquark and a 450 mev strange quark .",
    "similarly , the triquark mass is close to the mass of a @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) quark of 350 mev and a kaon of mass 495 mev .",
    "this difficultly can not be overcome by including a confinement model since there is no confining interaction between a kaon and a quark .",
    "therefore , in the present work we have made use of the quark propagator obtained in ref .",
    "[ 22 ] . in that work we considered quark propagation in the presence of a gluon condensate and found that the quark propagator had no on - mass - shell poles .",
    "that is , the quark was a non - propagating mode in the presence of the condensate . as we will see , the use of the quark propagator of ref .",
    "[ 22 ] enables us to proceed in our analysis of triquark structure .",
    "( in an early work we used the form of the propagator discussed in ref .",
    "[ 22 ] in a study of nontopological solitons [ 23 ] . )",

    "[ for @xmath15 . ] ]",
    "in an earlier work we discussed quark propagator in the presence of a condensate of the form @xmath16 which has recently been shown to be the landau gauge version of a more general gauge invariant expression .",
    "we have discussed quark propagation in the presence of such a condensate treating the vacuum as a random medium of gluon fields [ 22 ] .",
    "it is found that the quark propagator has no on - mass - shell poles indicating that the quark can not propagate over extended distances . as an example , we show one of the momentum - dependent mass functions obtained in our model in fig .",
    "it may be seen that the equation @xmath17 has no solution . in our work",
    "we have modified the solution shown in fig . 5 to have a constituent mass value of 350 mev for the up ( or down ) quark for spacelike @xmath18 and for a small region of timelike @xmath18 near @xmath19 .",
    "we use a simplified form for the momentum - dependent mass function.m(k^2 ) = [ k^2 + c^2]^1/2 k^2>m^2_q - c^2 , and m(k^2 ) = m_q k^2<m^2_q - c^2 , with @xmath20 gev and with @xmath21 being the quark mass which we take to be 350 mev for the up ( or down ) quark and 450 mev for the strange quark .",
    "in contrast to the result shown in the fig . 5 , we use the constituent quark mass for @xmath22 when @xmath23 . that is more in keeping with standard phenomenology , since the result shown in fig .",
    "5 does not capture the behavior expected for the constituent quark mass for the spacelike values of @xmath18 .",
    "in order to construct a bound - state triquark wave function we consider the diagrams of figs . 2 - 4 .",
    "2 we show the vertex ( open circle ) for the virtual triquark decay to a @xmath5 quark of momentum @xmath24 and a @xmath25 meson of momentum @xmath10 . the @xmath25 and @xmath26 mesons , and the diquark are taken to be on mass shell in our formalism .",
    "( such restrictions arise when we complete the @xmath27 integral in the complex @xmath27 plane . ) on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "2 we see the triquark component consisting of a @xmath8 quark and a scalar diquark .",
    "the final state is reached by the exchange of a @xmath6 quark of momentum @xmath28 . in the second figure on the right",
    "we have a @xmath6 quark and a @xmath26 meson in the intermediate state , with exchange of a @xmath8 quark yielding the final @xmath25 and @xmath5 quark .",
    "similar comments pertain to the processes shown in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "the triquark vertex depends upon @xmath29 and @xmath10 and has a dirac index @xmath30 : @xmath31 .",
    "we introduce coupling constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 which correspond to the coupling of either the kaon or scalar diquark to their quark components .",
    "[ see the appendix .",

    "2 - 4 is being considered .",
    "the @xmath43s are form factors introduced for the diquark and kaon vertices which appear in the figures as small filled circles .",
    "the form factor for the final - state kaon or diquark is f[(k-k/2)^2 ] = , with ( k-k/2)^2 = ( p^0-e_mi()-e_mf()/2)^2-(^2+^2/4-|| || u),where @xmath44 refers to either the kaon or diquark of momentum @xmath45 and @xmath46 refers to the final - state kaon or diquark .",

    "we remark that there are two terms to be considered on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 3.1 ) when we relate that expression to the diagrams of figs .",
    "there is also an implied sum over the dirac indices , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "since there are three decay channels ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) and four dirac indices ( 0,1,2,3 ) , there are twelve vertex functions to consider .",
    "if we take @xmath52 points for each vertex function , we need to evaluate a @xmath53 by @xmath53 matrix when searching for the bound - state eigenvalue . in our calculation",
    "it is useful to take @xmath54 along the @xmath55-axis so the vector @xmath45 has components @xmath56 .",

    "we have used @xmath63 gev and found @xmath64 gev . ]",
    "our interest in triquark structure is related to the diquark - triquark model of pentaquark structure [ 14 - 17 ] .",
    "as stated earlier , it is not clear that pentaquarks exist because of various contradictory results obtained in experimental studies .",
    "recent work of karliner and lipkin [ 24 ] appears to be quite important for the interpretation of experimental searches for the pentaquark .",
    "these authors claim that [ 24 ] : `` significant signal - background interference effects can occur in experiments like @xmath65 as a narrow @xmath66 resonance in a definite final state against a non - resonant background , with an experimental resolution coarser than the expected resonance width . we show that when the signal and background have roughly the same magnitude , destructive interference can easily combine with a limited experimental resolution to completely destroy the resonance signal . whether or not this actually occurs depends critically on the yet unknown phase of the @xmath66 and @xmath67 amplitudes ... '' .    in the present work we have introduced a model of triquark structure",
    "in order to carry out our calculation we have used a quark self - energy that does not give rise to on - mass - shell poles .",
    "similar results for gluon propagation in the presence of a condensate are presented in ref . [ 25 ] , where it is shown that the gluon is also a nonpropagating mode in the presence of the gluon condensate .",
    "it would be desirable to improve the model presented in our work and to see if there are other useful applications of the quark propagator used in this work . whether our triquark model may be used in a more detailed description of the pentaquark than",
    "that we have presented previously remains to be seen .      in order to calculate the normalization factor for our kaon or diquark we consider the diagram shown in fig .",
