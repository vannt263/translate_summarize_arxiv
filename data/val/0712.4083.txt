    "as is well known @xcite , the general solution for the pinney equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a time - dependent frequency function and @xmath3 a numerical constant , can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are constants such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are solutions for the time - dependent harmonic oscillator equation , @xmath10 with unit wronskian , @xmath11 .",

    "notice the differences to the quantum case , where the wave - function for the time - dependent singular harmonic oscillator is regular provided @xmath12 , restoring dimensional quantities @xcite .",
    "however , in the formal classical limit , setting @xmath13 we strictly need @xmath14 to avoid @xmath15 collapsing to the origin .",
    "this can be verified _",
    "e.g. _ from the solution shown in eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) or from the potential function associated to eq .",

    "( [ e1 ] ) does not possess an universal lie point symmetry group for arbitrary frequency function .",
    "this is in contrast to the richer @xmath28 algebra always admitted by the usual pinney equation @xcite for any choice of @xmath29 .",
    "it can be shown that the damped pinney equation has geometric symmetries for particular functional dependencies of @xmath29 , but these special cases are outside the scope of the present work .",
    "also the application of symmetry generators which are quadratic in the velocity does not produce new results .",
    "actually a coordinate transformation put eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) into the form of a generalized emden - fowler equation of index @xmath30 .",
    "there is an extensive literature on the integrability of generalized emden - fowler equations of arbitrary index @xcite , but we believe that it is still interesting to investigate in more detail the index @xmath31 case .",

    "the resulting equation is given by @xmath35 from eq .",

    "also generalized sundman transformations @xmath52 , can be shown to be useless .",
    "indeed the damped pinney equation does not matches the conditions established in @xcite in order to be reduced to the free particle or similar simple equations via generalized sundman transformations .    another avenue could be the reduction to an abel equation of the second kind through @xmath53 , so that @xmath54 however , eq .

    "notice the particular form of the nonlinear term , which needs to be proportional to @xmath62 so that the scaling ( [ t ] ) works .",
    "from a physical point of view , the most relevant case would be the one in which the nonlinear term is time - independent .",
    "in addition other , different classes of generalized pinney models with nonlinear and time - dependent damping have been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of the section is that apparently damped pinney equations in the form ( [ e1 ] ) does not possess a closed form solution valid for general @xmath29 , unlike the standard pinney equation .",
    "the same applies to the alternative form given by eq .",
    "( [ ef ] ) for arbitrary @xmath63 .",
    "the difficulties enumerated in the last section suggest the use of perturbation theory , in the case of weak damping . in other words",
    "we restrict to a small damping coefficient , @xmath26",
    ". an approximate solution would be welcome for physical applications as shown in section iv . in this manuscript",
    "this modest goal of deriving an approximate solution is achieved through the method of kuzmak - luke @xcite , which is good enough for equations which remain nonlinear even when the perturbation parameter goes to zero .",
    "indeed this is the case of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) when @xmath64 .",
    "in addition the kuzmak - luke technique applies only for slowly varying non - autonomous systems .",

    "naive perturbation theory would lead to a divergent solution .",
    "other methods of removal of the divergences in the perturbation series , like the lindstedt - poincar approach , could also be chosen .",

    "is just a first essay .",
    "however , probably there is no closed - form solution for the damped pinney equation , valid for arbitrary frequency functions , in contrast to the undamped case . adopting the optimistic view that such an universal solution could be constructed",

    "there would be further insight on fundamental questions about dissipative non autonomous quantum mechanics . up to now only special classes of damped pinney equations or the equivalent emden - fowler equation ( [ ef ] ) are known to be amenable to reduction of order .",
