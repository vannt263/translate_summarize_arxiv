    "a theoretical determination of scattering intensity and structure factors for fluids with a large number @xmath1 of components is , in general , a difficult task . in particular , this is true when some kind of polydispersity is present , as occurs in colloidal or micellar solutions @xcite .",
    "size polidispersity means that macroparticles of a same chemical species exhibit several different dimensions within a discrete or continuous set of possible values .",
    "interaction polydispersity then denotes a similar , and usually correlated , dispersion of parameters ( charges , etc . )",
    "defining the strength of interaction potentials .",
    "even when all macroparticles belong to a unique chemical species , a polydisperse fluid must therefore be treated as a multi - component mixture , with very large @xmath1 values ( of order @xmath2 ) or , in the infinite - component limit @xmath3 with an idealized continuous distribution of some properties @xcite .    in structural studies on polydisperse colloidal fluids ,",
    "a key role can be played by the models for which the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) integral equations of the liquid state @xcite admit analytical solutions leading to closed expressions of scattering functions for any finite @xmath1 and even for @xmath4 a sufficient condition for this is that the fourier transforms @xmath5 of the functions @xmath0 , solutions of the baxter factorized version of the oz equations @xcite , have a peculiar mathematical form , which we refer to as _",
    "dyadic _ structure @xcite and will be illustrated in section ii c. using the dyadicity , the explicit inversion of a related @xmath6 matrix @xmath7 is always possible for arbitrary @xmath1 and closed analytical expressions for the `` partial '' structure factors @xmath8 @xcite can be obtained .",
    "the scattering intensity and other `` global '' structure factors are then calculated as weighted sums of all partial structure factors .",
    "usually , the above sums are performed numerically by evaluating @xmath9 independent contributions @xmath8 at each @xmath10 @xcite . this procedure becomes numerically demanding for large @xmath1 , as required in polydisperse mixtures . on the other hand ,",
    "we stress that the dyadicity property also enables an alternative route ( followed in the present work ) which avoids the explicit computation of individual @xmath8 .",
    "the weighted sums can , in fact , be worked out analytically , by a procedure originally proposed by vrij @xcite and referred to as `` vrij s summation '' hereafter .",
    "the resulting closed analytical expressions of `` global '' scattering functions hold true for _ any _ number @xmath1 of components , can be easily applied to polydisperse fluids even in the limit @xmath11 and are particularly suitable to fit experimental scattering data .",
    "vrij @xcite first obtained a closed expression for the scattering intensity of polydisperse hard spheres ( hs ) within the percus - yevick ( py ) approximation .",
    "@xcite derived similar formulas for polydisperse charged hard spheres ( chs ) , by using the corresponding analytical solution within the `` mean spherical approximation '' ( msa ) .",
    "in the present paper we extend the approach previously exploited for polydisperse hs @xcite and chs @xcite to polydisperse `` sticky '' hard spheres ( shs ) .",
    "this simple model adds to an interparticle hard core repulsion an infinitely strong attraction at contact , and can be applied to real colloidal fluids of neutral spherical particles with a van der waals ( or dispersion ) force of attraction , working at very short distances .",
    "baxter @xcite proposed the one - component original version of this model , solved the oz equation with the py closure and found that such a system presents a liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "the adhesive contribution in baxter s hamiltonian is defined by a particular limiting case of a square - well tail in which the depth goes to infinity as the width goes to zero , in such a way that the contribution to the second virial coefficient remains finite but not zero ( baxter limit ) .",
    "stell @xcite found that shs of equal diameter in the baxter limit , when treated exactly rather than in the py approximation , are not thermodynamically stable .",
    "nevertheless , the py solution for shs as a useful colloidal model has received a continuously growing interest in the last two decades @xcite , partially because of its capability to exhibit a gas - liquid phase transition .",
    "perram and smith @xcite and barboy and tenne @xcite extended baxter s work to @xmath1-component fluids , using the same kind of hamiltonian and the py approximation .",
    "@xcite developed a rational function approximation to go beyond the py approximation and derived improved expressions for the radial distribution functions and structure factors of shs mixtures .",
    "unfortunately , the py analytical solution for mixtures requires the determination of a set of unknown _ density - dependent _ parameters @xmath12 , related , through @xmath13 coupled quadratic equations , to other parameters @xmath14 which appear in the potentials as monotonically increasing functions of the temperature @xmath15 and whose inverses measure the degree of adhesion ( `` stickiness '' ) of interacting spheres . in most cases the coefficients @xmath16 for given @xmath14 can only be found numerically , and this feature limits the applicability of the shs - py model to small @xmath1 values . as a matter of fact",

    "these authors pointed out that the dyadic structure of the shs - msa solution can be ensured _ a priori _ by imposing from the outset a berthelot - type rule @xcite on the coupling ( stickiness ) parameters @xmath24of the yukawa tail , i.e. @xmath25    within the same framework of yukawa - msa models , the present paper has a threefold aim : i ) we shall show that a new choice of yukawa coupling parameters , @xmath26 , slightly different from tutschka and kahl s ones @xcite , can produce an even simpler solvable model of shs , with a remarkable simplification of all analytical results ; ii ) we shall obtain closed analytical expressions for scattering intensity and other `` global '' structure factors of shs by extending the formalism successfully employed for hs and chs ; iii ) we shall present numerical applications not only in the case of equal stickiness for all particles , but also when a simple size - dependence of the stickiness parameters @xmath26 is assumed .",
    "the interplay among stickiness attraction , size polydispersity , and hard core repulsion gives rise to a rather complex behaviour .",

    "in this paper we have presented a new analytically solvable model for multi - component shs fluids within the msa closure , using a hard - core - yukawa potential with factorizable coupling parameters ( in the appropriate infinite amplitude and zero range limit ) .",
    "the model is simpler than previous ones available in the literature , since @xmath395 is in general 3-dyadic ( tutschka and kahl s model @xcite was 5-dyadic ) , with a consequent great simplification of all analytical formulas .",
    "we have stressed the importance of the `` dyadic structure '' of @xmath396 and recalled the properties of matrices with dyadic elements .",
    "such a feature allows the analytic inversion of @xmath92 required to get the partial structure factors @xmath8 . through vrij s summation , expressions have then been obtained for global structure functions , such as @xmath397 , @xmath49 and @xmath204 .",
    "these closed analytical formulas , just as their counterparts for polydisperse hs @xcite and chs @xcite , allow to `` bypass '' the computation of the individual @xmath13 partial structure factors , which may be a rather difficult task for polydisperse systems with large number of components .",
    "because of their simplicity , our expressions may therefore represent a very useful tool to fit experimental scattering data of real colloidal fluids .",
    "while the presented 3-dyadic expressions hold true for any choice of stickiness parameters @xmath26 , two particular versions of the model have been analyzed numerically .",
    "the first one assumes size polydispersity , but a single stickiness parameter for all particles ( model i ) , while the second one proposes stickiness parameters dependent on the diameters according to a linear law ( model ii ) .",

    "the combined influence of hard core repulsion , adhesive attraction and polydispersity can generate a variety of behaviours at the level of measurable average structure factor @xmath49 .",
    "we have recognized the existence of two different `` regimes '' for @xmath398 both in monodisperse and in polydisperse shs fluids . above a temperature @xmath376 , which in the monodisperse case coincides with the boyle temperature",

    "a `` strong - attraction '' regime sets in , and we have described its features in detail . it is found that @xmath399 is a decreasing function of the degree of size polydispersity @xmath400 it is also worth noting that the behaviour of our shs - msa models in the `` strong - attraction regime '' is in qualitative agreement with that of the shs - py model displayed in fig.s 3 and 4 of ref .",
    "20 , where the existence of two different `` regimes '' for @xmath49 was , however , not recognized .",
    "all our numerical results show that size polydispersity strongly affects the behaviour of @xmath49 in the first peak region and beyond , where the influence of stickiness polydispersity is less significant .",
    "models i and ii are nearly equivalent in this interval of @xmath10-values , whereas they may substantially differ near the origin .",
    "the present study shows that the use of a single stickiness parameter , instead of more realistic size - dependent ones , may lead to marked differences in the small angle scattering region at sufficiently high @xmath277 , i.e. when attraction is strong or temperature is low .    in the small @xmath10 region",
    "the adhesive forces and the specific relationship between stickiness and size parameters have far reaching consequences .",
    "although very little is known experimentally about the correlation between stickiness and size , it is reasonable to expect that larger particles attract each other more strongly . the linear dependence @xmath401 represents the simplest non - trivial choice , but other possibilities could also be taken into account @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite found that in some cases the shs - py model with a single stickiness parameter , independent of particle size , was unable to fit their experimental scattering data , and these authors already emphasized the possible role of stickiness polydispersity as a cause for the observed deviations .",
    "similar discrepancies between experimental and model @xmath268 values could be a crucial test for the soundness of our model ii with respect to model i , as well as of any other choice for the stickiness - size functional relationship .",
    "it would be also instructive to compare our shs - msa model with other recent theoretical approaches to polydisperse colloidal fluids .",
    "as an example , we mention the `` optimized random phase approximation '' joined with orthogonal polynomial expansions , proposed by lado and coworkers @xcite",
    ".    however , the most important advantage of the present model lies in its simplicity . in particular",
    ", version ii has special formal properties , since - only in this case - the expression of @xmath395 becomes 2-dyadic .",
    "therefore version ii can indeed be reckoned as the simplest solvable model for polydisperse shs and it could be a good candidate to tackle the issue of thermodynamics and phase stability of these fluids from a fully analytical point of view .",
    "we expect that compact expressions for pressure , chemical potentials , partial structure factors at @xmath402 , as well as other quantities required to investigate - for instance - sedimentation @xcite , vapor - liquid equilibrium and demixing in the presence of polydispersity , can easily be obtained .",
