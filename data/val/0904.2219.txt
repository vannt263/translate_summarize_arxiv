    "no x - ray counterpart of this source has been identified in the acis data .",
    "there is no reason to believe that j1906 was born in iras  19043 + 0741 since j1906 would have to be traveling at a speed of @xmath96 km s@xmath10 to reach its current position , assuming the same 5 kpc distance to the two sources and a 10 myr travel time ( considered to be an upper limit for an age of a star - forming region ; e.g. , hartmann 2001 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that iras  19043 + 0741 is an unrelated object accidently projected near j0906 .",
    "most of the x - ray point sources seen in the images do not have counterparts at other wavelengths ( e.g. , the sources in table 1 have no 2mass counterparts ) , with a possible exception for the source # 3 ( in fig .  1 and table 1 ) located @xmath97 northeast of the pulsar ( i.e. , outside the x - ray ring ) , which apparently has a relatively bright ( 26 mjy at 1.4 ghz ) radio counterpart nvss  190654 + 074715 but no ir counterpart .",

    "7 ) and hence does not support this interpretation .",
    "to date , x - ray emission has been detected from two dnsbs ( j07373039 and b1534 + 12 ; mclaughlin et al .",

    "the only tight binary with a pulsar ( although not a dnsb ) whose pwn has been resolved in x - rays ( stappers et al .",
    "2003 ) is the famous `` black widow '' binary , in which the wind of the energetic psr b1957 + 20 ablates the surface of the low - mass dwarf companion .",
    "since psrj1906 is even more energetic than psr b1957 + 20 , one could expect it to be easily detectable in x - rays .",
    "yet , we have not detected a single photon from j1906 in the 31.6 ks _",
    "chandra _ acis observation . we , however , discovered a puzzling diffuse emission shaped as an elliptical ring centered on the pulsar .",
    "below we discuss a possible origin of the ring , the upper limits on the j1906 x - ray luminosity , and the constraints on the physical properties of this unique system .",
    "psrj1906 is sufficiently young and energetic to power a detectable x - ray pwn .",
    "one can also expect to see thermal x - ray emission from the hot surface of the 100-kyr - old ns and possibly non - thermal emission from the pulsar s magnetosphere .",
    "in addition , the presence of a ns ( or heavy wd ) companion might perturb the psrj1906 wind and give rise to an additional emission component from an intrabinary shock .",
    "however , in j1906 the latter component should be much fainter compared to the other emission components mentioned above .",
    "indeed , if the j1906 companion is a wd , then the solid angle subtended by the wd , @xmath98 sr , is so small that the wd can not intercept a significant fraction of the pulsar s wind , even if the wind is strongly anisotropic .",
    "the fraction of the intercepted wind could be larger if the companion is a ns because in this case the effective cross section would be determined by the standoff distance , at which the magnetic pressure of the companion s magnetosphere is equal to the pressure of the pulsar s wind ( e.g. , kargaltsev et al .",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the companion ns is likely significantly older than psrj1906 because it takes at least @xmath99@xmath100 years to spin up this first - formed ns and expel the outer layers of its companion ( progenitor of psrj1906 ) through the common envelope phase , thereby shrinking the binary orbit to its current size .",
    "in addition , the first - born ns would only retain a weak magnetic field , @xmath101 g , after a long period of accretion .",
    "thus , if the j1906 s companion ns has properties similar to those of psr j07373039a , then the size of the compressed companion magnetosphere , @xmath102 cm ( see eq .",
    "[ 1 ] in arons et al .",
    "2005 ) , is comparable to a typical wd radius , i.e. , only a small fraction of the j1906 s wind would be intercepted .",
    "thus , one would expect the observed x - ray properties of the j1906 pwn to be such as what they would be if the pwn were powered by a solitary pulsar .",
    "finally , one could expect to see x - ray emission from the companion if it is indeed a ns .",
    "however , according to the evolutionary scenarios ( see above ) the companion ns is expected to be much older , with a colder surface and lower @xmath17 .",
    "hence , its x - ray emission is expected to be significantly fainter than that of psrj1906 .      the upper limit on the combined unabsorbed flux from the compact , unresolved pwn and the pulsar s magnetosphere , estimated as described in  2.1 , is @xmath103 erg s@xmath10 @xmath7 at 90% confidence , in the 0.58 kev band ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "this flux corresponds to the luminosity @xmath104 erg s@xmath10 and efficiency @xmath105 .",
    "compared to other pulsar + pwn systems , the inferred upper limits are unusually low , albeit not the most extreme .",
    "this is seen from figure 8 , in which we plotted the 0.58 kev pulsar + pwn luminosities for about 40 detected systems , and a few upper limits , versus pulsar s spin - down power @xmath17 ( see also kp08 ) .",
    "in particular , the pulsar + pwn luminosities and efficiencies for the objects with similar @xmath17 values are a factor of a few higher than the j1906 s upper limits ( see table 2 ) . yet",
    ", there is a younger , more energetic pulsar , j1913 + 1011 , from which no counts were detected in a 20 ks _",
    "acis - s3 observation , and for which the upper limit on the pulsar + pwn efficiency is even lower than for j1906 ( see fig .  8) .",
    "the nondetection of pulsars could be attributed to an unfavorable orientation of the x - ray beams , but it is more difficult to explain the nondetction of pwne , whose emission should be more isotropic ( and which are , on average , a factor of @xmath1064 more luminous in x - rays than their pulsars ; kargaltsev et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "thus , although the x - ray efficiency of the j1906 pwn is within the range of efficiencies measured for the entire sample of pulsar + pwn sources , j1906 is among the most underluminous ones .",
    "we should stress that the observed _ four orders of magnitude _ scatter in @xmath107 can not be attributed just to poorly measured distances , and therefore better understanding of pulsar wind physics is needed to explain the very different x - ray pulsar + pwn efficiencies .",
    "the nature of the tentatively detected ring - like structure ( see  2.1 ) is puzzling .",
    "one might assume that the ring is a limb - brightened shell of the remnant of the supernova in which psrj1906 was born .",
    "however , the size of the shell is too small for a snr of a 100 kyr age .",
    "for instance , in the sedov regime , the snr radius can be estimated as @xmath108 ( where @xmath109 erg s@xmath10 is the sn energy release , and @xmath110 is the ambient matter density in units of @xmath68 ) , much larger than the @xmath13 semimajor axis of the observed ellipse , at reasonable values of the parameters . to explain the ellipsoidal shape of the shell , an unusual density distribution in the ambient medium would be required .",
    "moreover , it is hard to expect such a narrow , distinct shell for so old snr .",
    "finally , the spectrum of the elliptical ring ( @xmath111 , detected up to 7 kev , albeit with a scant statistic ) is too hard for an snr shell ( its slope is typical for a pwn spectrum , however ; kp08 ) .",
    "therefore , we do not consider the snr shell interpretation to be plausible .    alternatively , one could attempt to interpret the ring as synchrotron emission produced immediately downstream of the termination shock in the pulsar wind .",
    "although such structures have been seen in many pwne ( e.g. , the rings around the crab and j1930 + 1852 pulsars ) , the x - ray emission from the pulsar ( or its unresolved vicinity ) is usually more luminous than that of the ring ( see fig .  2 in kp08 ) .",
    "the only apparent exception is the pwn in the ic443 snr ( gaensler et al .",
    "2006 ; weisskopf et al .",
    "2007 ) , where the alleged pulsar ( pulsations are yet to be found ) is a factor of 10 dimmer ( in terms of the 0.58 kev flux ) than the surrounding bright pwn emission associated with the termination shock ( which , however , is not clearly resolved into a ring in this case ) .",
    "the nondetection of psrj1906 implies that it is at least a factor of 2040 dimmer than the ring .",
    "the reasons for such a low pulsar - to - pwn flux ratio could be a special orientation of the magnetic and rotation axes resulting in suppressed magnetospheric activity , or the presence of absorbing matter near the pulsar ( cordes & shannon 2008 ) .",
    "in addition to the problematic flux ratio , the observed size of the ring requires stretching the limits on other physical parameters .",
    "since most of the psrj1906 s wind escapes unperturbed by the interaction with the companion ( see above ) , the termination shock in the pulsar wind would occur at @xmath112 pc ( it corresponds to the angular distance of @xmath113 ) , where @xmath114 dyne @xmath7 is the ambient pressure , and the factor @xmath115 takes into account possible anisotropy of the pulsar wind ( e.g. , kargaltsev et al .",
    "this distance is much smaller than the @xmath13 radius of the putative tilted ring , unless the pulsar wind is extremely well collimated in the equatorial plane and/or the ambient pressure is very low ( e.g. , @xmath116 , @xmath117 ) .",
    "these requirements can , however , be relaxed if the pulsar is substantially closer than 5 kpc ( measuring the pulsar s parallax is needed to establish the distance reliably ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the unabsorbed luminosity of the ring , @xmath118 erg s@xmath10 for the plausible @xmath83 , gives the x - ray efficiency @xmath119 , typical for a pwn ( see the dashed errorbar in fig .",
    "another conceivable interpretation of the observed structure might be a `` light echo '' caused by reflection from dust following a hypothetical flare ( e.g. , due to an accretion episode ) that could occur in the binary in the recent past ( e.g. , a few years ago ) .",
    "we know nothing about the putative flare , nor about the dust distribution around the system .",
    "however , the elliptical shape of the structure would require a very special dust distribution . in this scenario , which currently seems rather unlikely , a subsequent observation might show an increased size of the structure .",
    "finally , there still remains a possibility that the ring - like structure might be caused by fluctuations in the detector background ( which could be enhanced on one side because of the proximity to the chip edge ) and sky background ( e.g. , due to a number of faint , unresolved point sources , such as field stars , accidentally projected along the ellipse ) .",
    "a deeper _ chandra _ observation , with the target placed farther from the chip gaps , can ascertain the reality of the enigmatic ring .",
    "the surface of a 100-kyr - old ns is expected to be hot enough to emit soft x - rays ( yakovlev & pethick 2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "the surface temperature is likely non - uniform , with polar regions being hotter than the rest of the ns surface ( see , e.g. , pavlov et al .",
    "2002 ; de luca et al .",
    "the observation of j1906 allows us to put an upper limit on the bolometric luminosity , @xmath120 , of psrj1906 and compare it with the luminosities of other pulsars of similar ages .",
    "figure 4 shows the upper limits in the @xmath121-@xmath122 plane , computed in a plausible range of temperatures for three @xmath123 values , assuming a bb spectrum .",
    "the same figure shows the bb temperatures and bolometric luminosities for four other pulsars with similar spin - down ages .",
    "we see from figure 4 that the upper limit curves @xmath124 for psrj1906 ( @xmath125 kyr ) pass just slightly above the points corresponding to psr j1740 + 1000 ( @xmath126 kyr ) , b0656 + 14 ( @xmath127 kyr ) , and b105552 ( @xmath128 kyr ) . on the contrary , the point corresponding to psr j0538 + 2817 ( @xmath129 kyrs ) lie substantially above the upper limit curves because of the high temperature ( and small bb radius ) of this pulsar . however , based on the measurements of the proper motion and parallax of psr j0538 + 2817 , which resides in the s147 snr , its true age , 2060 kyr , is much smaller than the spin - down age , which may explain the high temperature ( ng et al .",
    "2007 ) . from the upper limits in figure 4",
    "we can conclude that psrj1906 is unlikely to be significantly younger than its spin - down age , and the bb luminosity of psrj1906 may be similar to those of the other three pulsars [ @xmath130 erg s@xmath10 ] .",
    "we should note that the single - component bb model , used above for the sake of comparison , provides only a crude approximation to the spectra of the thermally - emitting pulsars .",
    "for instance , the high - quality _ xmm - newton _ spectrum of psr j1740 + 1000 , which is almost an exact twin of j1906 in terms of the spin - down properties , is much better described by a three - component model , with two bb components ( @xmath132 and @xmath133 ev , and @xmath134 and @xmath135 km , respectively ) and a pl component with @xmath136 ( misanovic et al .",
    ", in preparation )",
    ". however , the bolometric luminosity of the low - temperature component , @xmath137 erg s@xmath10 , is close to that inferred from the simplified bb description of the psr j1740 + 1000 s x - ray spectrum , thus supporting the simplified analysis described above .",
    "in the 31.6 ks _ chandra _ acis observation we have not detected a single photon from the j1906 binary within the @xmath4 radius from its radio position .",
    "the nondetection of psrj1906 and its compact pwn could be explained by several factors .",
    "the thermal x - ray emission from the surface of the middle - aged psrj1906 is likely too strongly absorbed by the ism to detect it in a short observation , but the upper limit on the bolometric bb luminosity only slightly exceeds the bolometric luminosities observed in pulsars of similar ages .",
    "the nondetection of the pulsar s magnetospheric emission might be explained by an unfavorable orientation of the pulsar beam .",
    "the lack of x - ray emission from an intrabinary shock can be explained by a small size of the intrabinary interaction region that intercepts only a tiny fraction of the psrj1906 wind .",
    "however , the non - detection of a compact pwn around the j1906 binary is surprising ; perhaps it could be ascribed to unusual properties of the ambient medium or of the pulsar itself .",
    "we found tentative evidence of a puzzling elliptical ring centered on j1906 , with a @xmath80 significance ; however , the size of the structure is significantly larger than the stand - off distance to the termination shock produced by an isotropic pulsar wind in a typical ism .",
    "the pwn interpretation of the ring is not ruled out , but it requires a high degree of the pulsar wind collimation and a low density of the surrounding ism , or a distance significantly smaller than estimated from the pulsar s dispersion measure .",
    "deeper , high - resolution observations at x - ray and radio frequencies should help to clarify the nature of the observed diffuse structure and to unambiguously detect the elusive pulsar wind from this unique pulsar .",
