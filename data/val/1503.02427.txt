    "matching is of central importance to natural language processing . in fact , many problems in natural language processing can be formalized as matching between two short - texts , with different matching relations in different applications .",
    "for example , in paraphrase identification the relation is synonymy , and in information retrieval it is relevance . in the meantime matching is also a challenging problem , since it requires modeling of the two short - texts as well as their relation . in machine translation , for example",
    ", the model needs to determine whether a sentence in the source language has the same meaning as a sentence in the target language . in dialogue",
    ", the model needs to judge whether a message is an appropriate response to a given utterance .",
    "deep neural network can model non - linear and hierarchical relations  @xcite , and thus is well suited for short - text matching in natural language processing . the very limited work in that thread ,",
    "makes use of word embedding as the building blocks of matching model .",
    "although embedding - based methods have been proven effective on tasks like question answering  @xcite , paraphrase identification  @xcite , and even short text conversation @xcite , they are not enough good at handling the subtlety of general short - text matching",
    ". short - texts often represent rich content , their relations are also complicated , and more sophisticated structures are required for comparing the two short - texts .",
    "for example , when judging the appropriateness of response  ` you should rest more . ` \" to utterance  `",
    "i have to work during the weekend ! ` \" , we have to consider the semantic correspondence between  work over the weekend \" and  need to rest more \" , which is hard to be captured by an embedding - based model .",
    "we study the problem of short - text matching in a general setting .",
    "our method , named _ deep match tree _ ( deepmatch@xmath0 ) , consists of two sequentially connected components : 1 ) a mining algorithm to discover rich yet subtle patterns , defined in the product space of dependency trees , from a large corpus of paired short - texts , and 2 ) a learning algorithm to construct a deep neural network ( dnn ) for making a matching decision on the two short - texts , on the basis of the mined patterns .",
    "the dnn model is specifically trained based on contrastive sampling of negative examples .    without loss of generality , we focus on the task of matching a response to a given tweet on weibo , a popular chinese microblog service , for which a large amount of data is available .",
    "this is a hard problem , requiring consideration of complicated correspondence between the structures of two texts .",
    "our experimental results show that deepmatch@xmath0 is superior to existing methods on the problem .",
    "our main contributions are : 1 ) proposal of an algorithm for mining dependency tree matching patterns on large scale , 2 ) proposal of an algorithm for learning a deep matching model for using mined matching patterns , and 3 ) empirical validation of the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method using large scale real datasets .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     suppose that for we want to pick a more appropriate response from candidates and .",
    "the mining algorithm ( algorithm 1 ) discovers the following pattern after the sameentity abstraction @xmath1 where @xmath2 stands for any named entity .",
    "this pattern ( and its own sub - patterns ) then plays an important role in the later matching model in assigning a higher matching score to ( , ) , covering more specific patterns like @xmath3 which are filtered out in the mining step for its small support .",
    "the proposed model is related to several threads of work in natural language processing and machine learning .    [ [ deep - matching - models ] ] deep matching models + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    there are other works on using deep neural networks for the matching task  @xcite , which build upon given or learned representations of objects . in our model , we try to directly mine and learn the representations of matching .",
    "[ [ graph - based - kernel ] ] graph - based kernel + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    deepmatch@xmath0 extends the important notions in conventional graph kernels @xcite in two senses .",
    "first , our model allows matching of two different subgraphs in two domains ( e.g. , \\{`work`@xmath4 ` weekend ` } in one domain and \\{`have`@xmath4 ` rest ` } in the other ) , while graph kernels only consider the common subgraphs on two sides .",
    "second , our model captures the nonlinear and hierarchical relations between different matching patterns , while graph kernels simply add them together , with different weights determined by the types of sub - graphs .",
    "[ [ string - rewriting - kernel ] ] string - rewriting kernel + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    deepmatch@xmath0 is also related to the string - rewriting kernel ( srk ) @xcite for paraphrase identification , in",
    "that srk also generates many patterns of matching and learns to weigh them in training .",
    "the main difference is the matching patterns considered in srk are exhaustively enumerated ( although calculated in a smart way ) , while ours are discovered via a mining algorithm .",
    "we propose a generic model for matching two short - texts , which relies on a tree - mining algorithm to discover a vast amount of matching patterns and a dnn to further perform the task using those patterns .",
    "empirical study on the rather difficult task of tweet and response matching shows that our model can outperform competitor with large margins .",
    "this work is supported in part by china national 973 project 2014cb340301 .",
    "qun liu s work is partially supported by the science foundation ireland ( grant 12/ce / i2267 and 13/rc/2106 ) as part of the adapt centre at dublin city university ."
