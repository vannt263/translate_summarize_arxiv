    "hydrogen embrittlement is believed to be one of the main reasons for cracking of steel structures under stress@xcite .",
    "high strength steels often include a ferritic core made of @xmath0-iron ( body centered cubic lattice , bcc ) . to control and prevent the cracking of steel it is necessary to understand the chemical and physical properties of hydrogen inside bcc iron . in particular , it has been argued in the literature that the size of the interstitial h ( e.g. @xmath2 @xcite ) is too large to fit and diffuse easily in the iron bcc lattice@xcite .",
    "this argument has also been used to favor absorption on the t - site because it is larger than the o - site@xcite .",
    "arguments based in apparent sizes of atoms and a static lattice yield an useful basic approximation but leave out important factors .",
    "only a truly microscopic understanding of hydrogen dissolved in iron , including diffusion processes and fully accounting for forces and stresses inside the host matrix could lead to answers to the many questions arising from experiments .",
    "internal stresses are therefore key to understand the preferred absorption site .",
    "furthermore , external stresses can be used to modify diffusion barriers because can help to stabilize / de - stabilize strains originated inside the material to accommodate the absorbed impurity .",
    "owing to its interest , hydrogen absorbed in iron has been studied from different approaches , both from a theoretical and experimental point of view .",
    "unfortunately , a clear consensus about fundamental questions , like the nature of the equilibrium absorption site , the reasons for h to prefer some regions over others , or how to modify the diffusion barriers has not been reached yet .",
    "many theoretical papers have favored hydrogen absorbed in the tetrahedral site ( t - site)@xcite , some have preferred the octahedral one ( o - site)@xcite , others have reported that they are almost equivalent@xcite ( fig .",
    "[ figto ] ) . from an experimental point of view",
    ", it has been generally believed that hydrogen has low solubility and high mobility in bcc - iron .",
    "however , some recent experiments have attained high concentrations@xcite , at least locally .",
    "furthermore , experimental evidence has been reported showing that hydrogen might at least partly be found on the o - site@xcite .",
    "finally , diffusion barriers that change with the amount of h admitted into the material have been reported in the literature@xcite . in our calculations , we find that both sites are indeed quite similar in energies ; the delicate energetic balance between them depending on the stress distribution created by the interstitials . in turn , this depends on the hydrogen concentration , that can be related to locally inhomogeneous regions or more generally to its homogeneous averaged value .",

    "our methodological approach simulates the atomic absorption and diffusion of hydrogen in the body centered cubic iron lattice from first - principles .",
    "absorption in high - symmetry sites for different hydrogen loads ( densities ) has been explored and the internal strains / stresses have been calculated .",
    "diffusion barriers between these stationary absorption sites have been obtained , and the effect of external stresses on diffusion coefficients has been analyzed .",
    "our _ ab - initio _ calculations are based on the density functional formalism ( dft)@xcite and the theory of pseudopotentials@xcite .",
    "a periodic supercell is considered to minimize absorbate - absorbate interactions ( periodicity is @xmath3 with respect to a single cubic bcc unit cell -uc- ) .",
    "one h atom has been located in this supercell , determining the ratio h : fe from @xmath4 for the @xmath5 to @xmath6 for the @xmath7 . within this theoretical framework",
    "the accuracy of calculations mainly depend on the quality of the pseudopotential , the energy cutoff ( @xmath8 ) , and the density of the k - points mesh in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone ( a monkhorst - pack set of special k - points@xcite ) .",
    "calculations are performed with castep@xcite , where a plane - wave basis is used to expand electronic states ( spin - polarized bands are considered to account for magnetism in iron ) .",
    "an ultrasoft pseudo - potential ( 3d@xmath9 4s@xmath10 ) including a nonlinear core correction is used to describe iron atoms . the exchange and correlation contribution to the total energy",
    "is computed within a generalized gradients approximation given by perdew , burke and ernzerhof@xcite .",
    "an all - bands variational method is used to achieve self - consistency@xcite ( to improve convergence a smearing width of @xmath11 ev has been used ) .",
    "minimum thresholds to consider the calculations converged after optimization of the geometry are : variations in the total energy @xmath12 ev , maximum residual force on any atom @xmath13 ev , maximum residual stress on the uc @xmath14 gpa , maximum change in any atom position @xmath15  , and maximum change in any cell vector @xmath13  .",
    "these thresholds are enough for our purposes , but on some particular cases lower thresholds were considered when higher precision was desirable .",
    "index for the monkhorst - pack mesh ( @xmath16 results in a mesh of 455 points sampling the brillouin zone ) . ]",
    "the adequacy of the theoretical framework and the different convergence thresholds has been tested by computing a number of known properties for clean @xmath0-iron and atomic and molecular hydrogen separately . for iron , a global energy minimum is found for a bcc lattice ( hereafter referred as the @xmath17 ) with @xmath18  ( @xmath19 ) , a predicted magnetization of 2.25 @xmath20 , a bulk modulus of 175 gpa , and a poisson ratio of 0.30 .",
    "residual forces on the atoms in the bcc unit cell are @xmath21 ev /  , residual stress is @xmath22 gpa , and the total energy has been converged to @xmath23 ev ) .",

    "fractional errors are 1.8% , 1.4% , 3% , and 4% respectively , showing the accuracy of this kind of theoretical modeling to describe relevant properties of bcc iron .",
    "it is interesting , however , to notice that these quantities show oscillatory convergence as a function of the energy cutoff ( @xmath8 ) and the number of k - points ; convergence of physical properties has to be established carefully to make sure the oscillations are damped enough as to avoid agreements that might not be stable ( fig .",
    "[ figconv ] ) . properly converged values were obtained with @xmath24 ev and a @xmath25 monkhorst - pack ( mp ) mesh ( 455 points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone ) .",
    "however , values derived with @xmath24 ev and a @xmath26 mesh can be considered accurate enough for our purposes and most of our calculations below for the @xmath17 bcc unit cell have been performed with these parameters .",
    "calculations in @xmath3 unit cells ( n=2 , 3 ) have been performed with @xmath27 and @xmath17 mp meshes respectively .",
    "these theoretical calculations yield a detailed microscopic picture for the chemistry and the physics governing the material : iron atoms form metallic bonds of length 2.44  , favoring a ferromagnetic alignment of spins mostly residing in the regions around the atoms .",
    "bonding is such that the atomic s level of iron is depopulated in favor of d and p - levels ( a mulliken analysis shows that @xmath28 e is transferred ) .",
    "although this work is not concerned with face - centre cubic iron ( @xmath29-iron ) , we notice that this formalism predicts that the next stable phase of iron ( fcc ) is about @xmath11 ev / atom higher in energy , with @xmath30  ( experimental value is @xmath31  , a 5% discrepancy ) , and a magnetization lower by about a factor of @xmath32 due to disorder in the spin orientations .",
    "calculations for h and h@xmath33 have been performed on a @xmath34  super - cell ( only the @xmath35 point in the bz ) , predicting a bond length and a binding energy for the molecule within 0.5% and 5% from experimental values .",
    "the interaction between isolated atoms of h and fe is moderately weak , with a bonding distance of 1.54  and a binding energy of @xmath36 ( notice that the binding energy is quoted from the electronic energy alone and zero point vibrations have not been considered ) .",
    "this is corroborated by the very weak interaction of h with fe@xmath33 ; the binding energy stays nearly the same ( @xmath37 ev ) in a geometrical configuration where h prefers to interact with only one of the fe in the dimer .",
    "molecular h@xmath33 has been reported to dissociate on iron surfaces@xcite , in addition we do not find tendency for hydrogen atoms inside iron to re - form molecules . as an example",
    ", we compare for the @xmath38 unit cell ( fe@xmath39h@xmath33 ) the total energies of two h atoms located in nearby two different octahedral sites ( h - h distance is @xmath40  ) and a single h@xmath33 molecule .",
    "the dissociated state is favored by @xmath41 ev ( we notice that the energy gain comes partially from the smaller stress that the two separated h atoms introduce in the iron lattice compared with the one originated from the single h@xmath33 molecule ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that it is not necessary to study processes related to molecular h@xmath33 inside @xmath0-iron .",
    "even if the density of hydrogen absorbed in iron is expected to be small on the average , it can accumulate locally on some regions where the density can be high .",
    "indeed , important changes in the elastic properties of iron are found in these regions .",
    "furthermore , experimental evidence of high density phases have been reported in the literature@xcite .",
    "therefore , we find it interesting to analyze the stoichiometry fe@xmath33h . in the bcc lattice two high - symmetry sites ( o - site and t - site ) compete to locate the interstitial atom , and diffusion through the iron matrix takes place along paths joining them .",
    "we simultaneously optimize all the geometrical parameters to reach a global minimum in the total energy and small residual forces in any atom in the model .",
    "the three vectors defining the periodic lattice have been kept orthogonal ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the lengths of these vectors have been optimized taking into account the following cases : ( a ) independent optimization ( resulting in tetragonal systems ) , ( b ) optimization subject to the condition @xmath42 ( cubic system ) , and ( c ) no optimization , merely scaling the clean bcc unit cell ( the system is under stress , specially for high concentrations of the interstitial ) . starting with model ( a ) and allowing the lattice to relax completely , we have reached a best configuration with residual forces @xmath43 ev /  and residual stresses @xmath44 gpa ( the energy change was @xmath45 ev and the maximum final displacement of any atom was @xmath44  ) . under these conditions , the o - site is the global minimum , the t - site being higher in energy by @xmath46 mev ( table  [ tabdft ] ) . to reach this configuration",
    ", the lattice suffers a large body centered tetragonal ( bct ) distortion , keeping the p4/mmm symmetry group ( 16 elements ) , while the optimum geometry for the fully relaxed lattice for h in the t - site increases the symmetry from c2 ( 4 elements ) to p-4m2 ( 8 elements ) . our preferred absorption site is different from the one recently obtained by jiang and carter for the same density using a similar formalism@xcite .",
    "there are several possible sources for this discrepancy , e.g. the pseudopotentials , the exchange and correlation functional , or even the fine details of how different codes reach a self - consistent solution and compute forces on the atoms .",
    "we believe these are all unlikely sources to explain the different final configuration due to the excellent performance when comparing different physical magnitudes with experimental data or just between different theoretical methods of similar quality .",
    "jiang and carter predict for fe@xmath33h that the t - site is preferred over the o - one by @xmath47 mev , while we have found the reversed conclusion by @xmath46 mev .",
    "the overall @xmath48 mev discrepancy is indeed a small one , but it seems to be above the noise level expected from the convergence tests .",
    "the reason for the difference is most likely related to the final optimum configuration obtained in each calculation ( our final configuration is given in table  [ tabgeom1 ] ) .",
    "the energy landscape is a complex one , and the algorithm searching for a global minimum could be trapped in nearby local ones .",
    "we have made an effort to minimize residual forces and stresses as much as possible . to search for a global minimum",
    "we have used the broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno algorithm that is known to be a robust one and has been successfully applied both in electronic structure calculations and in low - energy electron diffraction optimization of geometries@xcite .",
    "the resulting bct distortion for h in the o - site is indeed quite big and might be hidden in a difficult landscape , we notice that our optimization under the restriction of an isotropic deformation of the unit cell ( @xmath42 ) results in the t - site as the preferred one by @xmath49 mev . finally , we should comment that although the bct distortion seems significant , in particular because it would favor the bcc to fcc transformation , the discussion here is based solely on electronic energies , and other factors might play an important role too .",
    "configurational disorder is expected to favor t - sites .",
    "the relative contribution of entropy to the helmholtz free energy for t - site and o - site can be estimated from the simple consideration that there are four times more configurations for t - sites .",
    "therefore , t - sites are favored on the grounds of entropic arguments by @xmath50 , approximately 34 mev at room temperature , which tends to make the energetic more similar but still is not enough to make the t - site the global minimum .",
    "furthermore , zero - point energy corrections ( zpe ) may affect differently the energy of two absorption sites with different coordination and geometrical parameters .",
    "a careful determination of the phonon spectra for this system demands the use of a considerable amount of computing time and is planned for a future paper .",
    "our own initial estimates , based in sketchy models that can be solved quickly , results in the o - site getting further stabilized with respect to the t - site by @xmath51 mev .",
    "a word of caution is in order here since these values may have a large error bar that we have not properly estimated .",
    "the model used to deduce these values is as follows : the cut - off energy has been reduced to @xmath52 ev , the k - points mesh to a mere @xmath53 , phonons have been estimated only in the @xmath35 point using a finite displacement method ( @xmath54  ) and a @xmath38 super - cell .",
    "therefore , these corrections are only to be taken as rough order of magnitude estimates , but in our calculations zpe does not switch the preferred absorption site . frequencies in @xmath35 for the o and t sites are all real , marking the character of global and local minima for these sites .    from a physical point of view , in this high concentration regime , the main characteristic of the tetragonal distortion necessary to accommodate h in the o - site is that it is both large and anisotropic .",
    "first , we notice that only occupation of similarly oriented o - sites over many unit cells would allow this kind of distortion .",
    "second , fractional changes in the uc volume are large , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , for o - site and t - site respectively ; this is the trace of the strain tensor and measures the global stress produced by the interstitial .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to understand the stress distribution created around the distorted cell .",
    "total energies for a model where the uc is allowed to relax keeping the cubic uc ( @xmath42 ) show that when h is in o the system gains a fair amount of energy from the anisotropic deformation ( @xmath57 mev ) , while when h is near t - site the gain is smaller ( @xmath58 mev ) . under this cubic restriction ,",
    "the fractional change of the uc volume are @xmath59 and @xmath56 for o - site and t - site respectively ; the interstitial fits poorly in o in absence of the tetragonal distortion ( internal pressure upon injection of the interstitial h in the clean iron bcc lattice amounts to several tens of gpa ) . from a chemical point of view , the role of the interstitial atom is to debilitate the fe - fe nearest - neighbors ( nn ) interaction ; fe - fe bond length increases by @xmath60 and @xmath61  for h in o - site and t - site respectively . in both sites , hydrogen tends to get negatively charged ( @xmath62 ) , while its spin is delocalized contributing little to the total integrated spin density that only increases by @xmath63 @xmath20 with respecto to clean bcc fe .",
    "it is worth to notice that the tetragonal distortion of the uc for h absorbed on the o - site ( @xmath64 ) is not far away from the distortion predicted for bain s mechanism to transform from @xmath0-iron to @xmath29-iron ( @xmath65)@xcite .",

    "the elastic energy distribution associated to these stresses is well converged at these distances ( table  [ tabfe ] ) ; contributions from larger regions only amount to 1 or 2% of the total elastic energy .",
    "this result shows why it is not necessary to go beyond the @xmath73 supercell in our ab - initio simulations .",
    "the stress distributions are very different for h in o - site and in t - site : the former is very anisotropic ( @xmath74 ) and its maximum value is @xmath40 times the maximum value for t - site .",
    "the stored elastic energy , quadratic on the stress tensor , is approximately ten times higher for h in the o - site ( table  [ tabfe ] ) .",

    "this number agrees well with the value previously obtained from the ab - initio simulation , @xmath76 ev for a fully relaxed lattice , justifying the interpretation derived from these calculations .",
    "this approach shows that the main difference between absorption in the t - site and o - site is related to the relaxation of elastic energy in neighboring cells .",
