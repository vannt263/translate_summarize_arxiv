    "heavy quark production in high energy hadronic collisions constitutes a benchmark process for the study of perturbative qcd and an important tool to explore flavour physics .",
    "* @xmath1 quarks are produced in abundance in hadronic collisions , and will eventually allow ultimate tests of cp violation in the @xmath1 system , as well as studies of rare @xmath1 decays with branching ratio levels of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "a detailed understanding of the production properties at future machines ( such as the lhc ) is therefore of the utmost importance . *",
    "the comparison of the current experimental data with the predictions of qcd provides a necessary check that the ingredients entering the evaluation of hadronic processes ( partonic distribution functions and higher order corrections ) are under control and can be used to evaluate the rates for more exotic phenomena or to extrapolate the calculations to even higher energies .",
    "* accurate studies of the production properties of the @xmath3 quark rely on a solid understanding of the qcd dynamics , in order to isolate possible contributions from new phenomena .",
    "* measurements of heavy quark production in fixed target experiments are dominated by data at low , a region where non - perturbative effects are not negligible .",
    "the comparison of data with the expectations of perturbative qcd offers the possibility to explore some interesting features of non - perturbative hadronic dynamics @xcite .",
    "* at hera , @xmath4 and @xmath1 quarks are largely produced via photon - gluon fusion , therefore providing a direct probe on the gluon density of the proton , complementary to the information extracted from the measurement of structure functions .",
    "first data have already become available , and have been shown at this conference .",
    "* production of quarkonium states , in addition to providing yet another interesting framework for the study of the boundary between perturbative and non - perturbative qcd , is important in view of the use of exclusive charmonium decays of @xmath1 hadrons for the detection of cp violation phenomena .",
    "in this presentation we review the current status of theoretical calculations , and discuss the implications of the most recent experimental measurements of @xmath1 quarks and charmonium states performed at the tevatron @xmath5 collider .",
    "to start with , we briefly report on the current status of the theoretical calculations .",
    "a distinction must be made between calculations performed at a complete but fixed order in perturbation theory ( pt ) , and those performed by resumming classes of potentially large logarithmic contributions that arise at any order in pt .",
    "the exact matrix elements squared for heavy quark production in hadronic collisions are fully known up to the @xmath6 , for both real and virtual processes .",
    "these matrix elements have been used to evaluate at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) the total production cross section @xcite , single - particle inclusive distributions @xcite  and two - particle inclusive distributions ( a.k.a .",
    "correlations ) @xcite .",
    "three classes of large logarithms can appear in the perturbative expansion for heavy quark production :    1 .",
    "@xmath7^n \\sim [ \\as\\log(1/x_{\\rm bj})]^n$ ] terms , where @xmath8 is the hadronic cm energy squared .",
    "these small-@xmath9 effects are possibly relevant for the production of charm or bottom quarks at the current energies , while they should have no effect on the determination of the top quark cross section , given the large @xmath10 mass .",
    "several theoretical studies have been performed @xcite , and the indications are that  production cross sections should not increase by more than 3050% at the tevatron energy because of these effects . 2 .",
    "@xmath11^n$ ] terms , where @xmath12 is the transverse momentum of the heavy quark pair .",
    "these contributions come from the multiple emission of initial - state soft gluons , similarly to standard drell yan corrections .",
    "these corrections have been studied in detail in the case of top production , where the effect is potentially large due to the heavy top mass @xcite .",
    "they are not relevant to the total cross section of  quarks , but affect the kinematical distributions of pairs produced just above threshold @xcite , or in regions at the edge of phase space , such as @xmath13 .",
    "3 .   @xmath14^n$ ] terms , where @xmath15 is the transverse momentum of the heavy quark .",
    "these terms arise from multiple collinear gluons emitted by a heavy quark produced at large transverse momentum , or from the branching of gluons into heavy quark pairs . again",
    "these corrections are not expected to affect the total production rates , but will contribute to the large-  distributions of @xmath4 and @xmath1 quarks .",
    "no effect is expected for the top at current energies .",
    "these logarithms can be resummed using a fragmentation function formalism @xcite , with a significant improvement in the stability w.r.t .",
    "scale changes for @xmath16 gev .",
    "the status of @xmath1 production at hadron colliders has been quite puzzling for some time .",
    "data collected by ua1  @xcite at the cern s@xmath5s collider ( @xmath17 = 630 gev ) were in good agreement with theoretical expectations based on the nlo qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , the first measurements performed at 1.8 tev by the cdf @xcite experiment at the fermilab collider showed a significant discrepancy with the same calculation .",
    "the new data presented at this conference @xciteby the two fermilab experiments , cdf and d0 , allow us to draw a more complete picture of the situation .",
    "we present all three sets of data from ua1 , cdf and d0 in a single plot , containing the ratio of the measurements to the theory , for a uniform choice of parameters entering the theoretical calculation . in fig .",
    "[ ratio - dflm ] , we choose the same theoretical prediction as was available at the time of the ua1 measurements , namely the central set of the dflm @xcite  parton distributions ( @xmath18 mev ) , @xmath19 gev and renormalization / factorization scales equal to the transverse mass of the @xmath1 quark , @xmath20 . depending on whether we use the d0 or the cdf data as representative of the @xmath1 cross section at 1.8 tev , we can draw two different conclusions .",
    "the plot shows clearly that the ratio _ data / theory _ is the same , at ua1 and at d0 , to within less than 10% . while larger than 1 , this ratio can be reduced by selecting different input parameters , still in the range of acceptable values .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ ratio - mrsa ]  shows the same distributions with the theory evaluated using the more recent set of parton densities mrsa @xcite , @xmath21 gev , @xmath22 and @xmath23 mev , a value close to the lep measurement of . with this choice of parameters",
    "the agreement between nlo qcd and data is perfect , both at 630 and at 1800 gev .",
    "the data from cdf are in good agreement with the theory shape , but are about 3040% higher in normalization relative to the d0 ones .",
    "if one were to choose cdf data as representative of the tevatron rate , the conclusion would be that the @xmath1 production cross section grows between 630 and 1800 gev by a factor of 40% more than nlo qcd predicts .",
    "an effect of such a size would be in agreement with the evaluation of the small-@xmath9 effects mentioned earlier .",
    "the only conclusions we can therefore draw from the current data are that :    1 .",
    "the comparison of data and nlo predictions for the @xmath1 production at 630 and 1800 gev favours small values of the @xmath1 mass and values of  consistent with the lep measurement ; 2 .",
    "the relative difference in the data / theory ratio at 630 and 1800  gev is at most 40% , value obtained using the cdf data .",
    "this is consistent with the estimated effect of small-@xmath9 higher order corrections ; 3 .",
    "there is a residual 3040% discrepancy in absolute normalization between the cdf and the d0 results , that will need to be resolved before additional progress can be made in interpreting the data .",
    "the production of heavy quarkonium states in high energy processes has recently attracted a lot of theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "detailed measurements of differential cross sections for production of ,  and @xmath24 states have recently become available [ 1418 ] , and have been reviewed at this conference @xcite .",
    "theoretical models for production have existed for several years ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review and references ) .",
    "the comparison of these models with the most recent data has shown dramatic discrepancies , the most striking one ( theory predicting a factor of 50 fewer prompt  than measured by cdf @xcite ) having become known as the `` cdf anomaly '' .",
    "attempts to explain the features of these data have recently led to a deeper theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of quarkonium production .",
    "i will briefly summarize here this progress ( for a more complete review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the production of quarkonium at large  is a phenomenon with two different time scales : the shorter time scale corresponds to the generation of the heavy quark pair , the longer one to the binding of the pair . in all models",
    ", it is assumed that the details of the bound state formation can be absorbed into some non - perturbative parameter , directly related to the value of the non - relativistic wave function at the origin . where the models differ is in specifying how the heavy quark pair , produced by the hard scattering in a generic colour and angular momentum state , evolves into a state with the right quantum numbers to form the desired hadron . in the first qcd - based model , the so - called colour singlet model ( csm , @xcite )",
    ", it was assumed that the quark pair is produced in a colour singlet state with the right angular momentum already during the hard collision .",
    "it is easy to show that the production of quarkonium in the csm is heavily suppressed at large , mainly because it is difficult to hold the bound state together when this is probed at the large virtualities typical of a high-  phenomenon @xcite . in other words , in the naive csm ,",
    "production of quarkonium is a higher - twist effect , highly suppressed by a form - factor - like damping as soon as  becomes larger than the mass of the state .",
    "this prediction has been recently disproved by the data . the dotted line in fig",
    ".  [ fpspdata ] , for example , shows the prediction of the csm model for  production at the tevatron , compared to the cdf data @xcite .",
    "not only is the overall normalization of the theory curve significantly lower than the data , but also the shape is much steeper than observed .    it has been pointed out recently @xcite   that higher order contributions in  can dominate production at large .",
    "the process responsible for these contributions is the splitting of a large-  gluon into a @xmath25 pair , which then evolves into a colour singlet state by emission of one or more perturbative gluons .",
    "the additional powers of  required for this process are largely compensated by the absence of a form factor suppression .",
    "it turns out , in fact , that these terms are of order @xmath26^n$ ] relative to the lo diagrams ( @xmath27 in the case of @xmath24 production , and @xmath28 in the case of  or ) , and become dominant as soon as  is slightly larger than @xmath29 , the quarkonium mass .",
    "the effect of these _ fragmentation _ contributions is shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fpspdata ] : the  shape is now correct , although the total rate is still low by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "a similar behaviour is observed in the production of s . on the contrary , the predictions for @xmath24 production , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fchi ] , agree with the data both in shape and in rate @xcite .    a possible solution to this remaining discrepancy in the  and sector",
    "was recently suggested by braaten and fleming @xcite .",
    "their proposal is based on the observation that , contrary to the case of the gluon fragmentation into  states , where the emitted gluons are both hard , the fragmentation process into @xmath24 states is dominated by emission of a soft gluon .",
    "a large infrared logarithm enhances the fragmentation rate of a gluon into @xmath24 s relative to that into s .",
    "this logarithm signals the presence in the @xmath24 state of a large component made by a @xmath30 pair in a colour octet @xmath31 state , accompanied by an on - shell gluon @xcite .",
    "this component has a non - zero overlap with the @xmath32 state produced by the splitting of the large-  gluon .",
    "braaten and fleming suggested that a similar colour octet @xmath31 component might be present in the relativistic expansion of the  and  wave function . the work of ref .",
    "@xcite  indicates that such a component should have an amplitude of order @xmath33 relative to the leading order , colour singlet component .",
    "therefore , the transition of a hard gluon into a , via coupling to the @xmath31 colour octet component of the  wave function , would be of order @xmath34 relative to the standard fragmentation function of the csm .",
    "a detailed evaluation of the transition amplitudes , @xcite , shows that the ratio of the two contributions is actually @xmath35 , a number large enough to explain the factor of 50 discrepancy between the data and the predictions of the csm model .",
    "the contribution of this colour octet production to the  distribution is shown as a solid line in fig .",
    "[ fpspdata ] . here",
    "the new non - perturbative parameter , the value of the overlap squared between the @xmath32 colour octet state from gluon splitting and the  wave function , was derived from a fit to the data .",
    "its numerical value has the right order of magnitude expected from the @xmath33 suppression , consistently with what was suggested earlier .",
    "similar results can be obtained for the production of s @xcite .",
    "the model of quarkonium production via the colour octet mechanisms is now the subject of intense work , and we will soon have available a more complete picture of its implications , including the phenomenology of @xmath36 and charmonium in fixed target experiments .",
    "now that the existence of the @xmath3 quark has been firmly established via its detection in hadronic collisions @xcite , experimental studies will focus on the determination of its properties .",
    "in particular , the measurement of its mass and of the production cross section and distributions will certainly be among the first studies of interest .",
    "the production properties , should they display anomalies , could point to the existence of exotic phenomena @xcite .",
    "we present here some kinematical distributions @xcite   that are of potential interest for these comparisons .",
    "the inclusive  distribution is sensitive to channels such as @xmath37 @xcite , which are found to contribute with a small cross section , predominantly at low .",
    "the invariant mass of the pair is an obvious probe of the possible existence of strongly coupled exotic resonances , such as technimesons @xcite .",
    "the transverse momentum of the pair is an indication of the emission of hard hadronic jets in addition to those coming from the top decays .",
    "the presence of these additional jets generates potentially large combinatorial backgrounds to the reconstruction of the top mass peak from the decay products @xcite .",
    "an accurate understanding of these backgrounds is very important for a precise measurement of the top mass .",
    "all the results we show were obtained using the nlo qcd matrix elements @xcite , mrsa parton densities @xcite , @xmath38 gev .",
    "since most experimental studies are performed using shower monte carlo event generators to simulate the behaviour of the events in the detectors , we will compare our nlo results with those we obtained with herwig @xcite .",
    "this is important in order to assess the reliability of the theoretical inputs used by the experiments . throughout our plots , we rescale the herwig calculations by the perturbative @xmath39 factor given by the ratio of the nlo to lo results .",
    "the @xmath39 factor is of the order of 1.3 for all choices of parameters .    as an example of a single inclusive quantity",
    ", we show the top  distribution in fig .",
    "[ toppt ] .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the nlo result obtained using @xmath40 .",
    "the square points correspond to the herwig prediction , rescaled by a @xmath39 factor equal to 1.34 .",
    "the curves obtained by changing and  by a factor 0.5 to 2 show an overall normalization change by approximately @xmath41 .",
    "no change in the shape is observed .",
    "the agreement between the nlo and herwig results , and the stability under scale changes , indicate that the prediction for the  distribution of top quarks is solid . aside from an overall small change in normalization ,",
    "this result is not affected by the inclusion of higher order soft gluon emission , @xcite .",
    "those distributions which are trivial at leading order ,  and , are on the contrary most sensitive to multiple gluon emission from the initial state .",
    "this is because even small perturbations can smear a distribution that at leading order is represented by a delta function , as is the case for the  and  ones .",
    "the largest effect is observed in , fig .",
    "[ fptpair ] , where we include the nlo curves relative to the three choices of scales , @xmath40 ( solid ) , /2 ( dots ) and 2(dashes ) .",
    "contrary to the previous cases , significant differences in shape arise here among the three choices in the small-  region .",
    "the herwig result ( normalized to the area of the solid curve ) is also shown .",
    "the nlo and the herwig distributions assume the same shape only for  larger than approximately 20 gev .",
    "we conclude that an accurate description of the region @xmath42 gev requires the resummation of leading soft and collinear logarithms , as implemented in appropriate shower monte carlo programs .",
    "studies of the angular correlations between bremstrahlung gluon jets and the @xmath1-jets from the decay of the top quarks have been performed in ref .",
    "these authors found some important discrepancies between the results obtained from a fixed order perturbative calculation and from herwig .",
    "a full understanding of the origin of these discrepancies and a detailed study of their possible impact on the combinatorial background to the reconstruction of the top mass are in progress .",
