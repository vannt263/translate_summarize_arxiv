    "one of the fundamental problems in molecular science is the quantum - mechanical origin of chirality .",
    "the chiral configurations of a chiral molecule have a many - particle , complex dynamics .",
    "this dynamics can be effectively modeled by the motion of a particle in a symmetric double - well potential  @xcite .",
    "the states associated to chiral configurations are assumed to be localized in two minima of the potential .",
    "the superposition of chiral states is realized by tunneling through the barrier .",
    "if the barrier is high enough to prevent tunneling , once prepared , the chiral state is preserved . upon a quantitative analysis",
    ", however , this explanation seems rather insufficient for low - barrier molecules  @xcite . as a modern resolution , the chiral interactions , i.e. interactions that prefer a particular chiral state , became important .",
    "they can be effectively taken into account by introducing an asymmetry parameter into the symmetric double - well potential .",
    "if they are strong enough to overcome tunneling process , the molecule is confined in the preferred chiral state .",
    "the most discussed interactions in this context are parity - violating weak interactions  @xcite , intermolecular interactions  @xcite and interaction with the circularly - polarized light  @xcite .",
    "the problem is that the induced chirality is demolished by the dissipative effects of the surrounding environment .",
    "the open chiral molecule has been studied by the mean - field approach , and more completely by the decoherence theory . in the mean - field theory ,",
    "the environment is envisaged as an effective potential added to the schrdinger dynamics of the system  @xcite .",
    "the resulting non - linear dynamics can be served to stabilize a particular chiral state  @xcite .",
    "recently , this approach is extended to include chiral interactions in the langevin formalism of open quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "+ the decoherence theory describe the superselection of a preferred set of system s states by the environment - induced , dynamical destruction of quantum coherence between them  @xcite .",
    "the environment acting upon the molecule might be dilute ( e.g. , gaseous environment ) or condensed ( e.g. , biological environment ) .",
    "the dynamics of a system in a gas phase was studied by the scattering model or more conveniently collisional decoherence  @xcite .",
    "the application of collisional decoherence to the study of the tunneling of a chiral molecule in a gas phase was first done in the pioneering works of harris and stodolsky  @xcite and silbey and harris  @xcite .",
    "more refined works showed that the environmental collisions induce an indirect position - measurement on the molecule and thus stabilize the chiral states  @xcite . in a condensed phase , however , since the medium is always present , the idea of a collision is inapplicable .",
    "the simplest representation of a condensed phase is a bath of harmonic oscillators . at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "the states of the molecule are effectively confined in the two - dimensional hilbert space spanned by the two chiral states .",
    "when the two - level system couples linearly to the environmental oscillators , the result is the renowned spin - boson model studied extensively in the literature , especially by leggett and co - workers@xcite . recently ,",
    "this model is employed to examine the role of quantum coherence in biological systems  @xcite .",
    "an elementary application of this model to chiral molecules is found in the work of silbey and harris  @xcite .",
    "recently , tirandaz and co - workers solved the general spin - boson model to examine the interplay between tunneling process and chiral interactions in a biological environment  @xcite .",
    "they showed that despite the powerful racemization effects of the biological environment the chiral interactions induced by the same environment can prohibit the tunneling process and thus preserve the initial chiral state .",
    "+ the description of the decoherence dynamics is usually formulated in terms of the so - called master equations , which yield the _ approximate _ evolution of the reduced density matrix of the open quantum system .",
    "the master equation is essentially a mathematical object which maps the initial state to the final state without providing a clear - cut physical understanding of the inner dynamics .",
    "moreover , it is recently discussed that conceptually the state of the closed system and the reduced state assigned to that system when it interacts with the environment are different  @xcite . in order to present a simple and straightforward demonstration of the stabilization of molecular chirality , in this paper ,",
    "we apply the time - dependent perturbation theory to examine the dynamics of an open chiral molecule .",
    "the main emphasis here would be on the comparison between dynamics influenced by dilute and condensed environments .",
    "it is demonstrated that the interaction with _ any _ environment can be rigorously mapped onto a system linearly coupled to an oscillator environment , provided the interaction is sufficiently weak and second - order perturbation theory can be applied  @xcite .",
    "we describe the dynamics of chirality by an asymmetric double - well potential , and the environment is represented by a collection of harmonic oscillators , with different spectral densities for dilute and condensed phases .",
    "we exemplify the dilute and condensed phases respectively by an inert background gas and water .",
    "note that for we focus on chiral molecules with high tunneling rates , the strength of chiral interactions can be considered less than the tunneling strength , especially in the dilute phase .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the chiral molecule and its harmonic environment .",
    "we examine the dynamics of chiral states in the third section using time - dependent perturbation theory . in the forth section",
    ", we first estimate the parameters relevant to our analysis , specify the spectral densities of dilute and condensed environments and accordingly present our results .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in the last section .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the entire system composed of the chiral molecule and the environmental particles is conveniently defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the molecular , environmental and interaction hamiltonians , respectively . + a chiral molecule is found at least as two identical enantiomers through the inversion at molecule s center of mass by a long - amplitude vibration known as the contortional vibration  @xcite .",
    "this particular vibration can effectively be described by the motion of a particle in an asymmetric double - well potential .",
    "the minima of the potential are associated to two enantiomers of the molecule and the asymmetry can be considered as an overall measure of all chiral interactions . for an isolated chiral molecule ,",
    "the asymmetry is merely resulted from the internal chiral interactions i.e. , the parity - violating weak interactions  @xcite . for a chiral molecule in interaction with the environment , however , the external chiral interactions e.g. , the dispersion intermolecular interactions  @xcite and interaction with the circularly - polarized light  @xcite are the main source of asymmetry .",

    ", we incorporate the dimensionless form of the model .",
    "the potential has the characteristic length @xmath8 and the characteristic energy @xmath10 which we adopt as the units of length and energy , respectively .",
    "the corresponding characteristic time can be defined as @xmath11 which we consider as the unit of the time .",
    "likewise , the unit of the momentum is taken as @xmath12 .",

    "+ in the limit @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 as thermal energy , @xmath21 as boltzmann constant , and @xmath22 as temperature ) , energy states are confined in two - dimensional hilbert space spanned by two chiral states @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , such a two - level approximation holds for most chiral molecules  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the effective molecular hamiltonian in the chiral basis can be written as  @xcite @xmath25 where we defined @xmath26 in which @xmath27 is the tunneling strength and @xmath28 , known as the localization strength , is a measure of the the energy difference between two enantiomers .",
    "if chiral interactions are strong enough to overcome tunneling process , @xmath29 , the chiral states become stable , and thus the chirality problem is resolved .",
    "therefor , here we focus on chiral molecules with low barrier , where the tunneling strength is larger than the localization strength , @xmath30",

    "+ the interaction hamiltonian is generally defined by a linearly - coupled harmonic - environment model as @xmath42 where the function @xmath43 is the displacement in each environmental oscillator @xmath34 induced by the molecule . for simplicity , we assume that the interaction model is separable ( @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the coupling strength ) and also bilinear ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "+ the shift in the molecular energy due to the perturbation @xmath3 is obtained up to the second order as @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the state with the energy shifted to @xmath50 by perturbation is not actually stationary and decays with a finite lifetime @xmath51 given by fermi s golden rule as @xmath52",
    "we assume that the initial state of the entire system can be written as @xmath53 is an arbitrary state of the chiral molecule .",

    "+ we suppose that the initial state of the molecule is the left - handed state @xmath23 .",
    "the evolved state function of the whole system in the chiral basis of the molecule can be written as @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",

    "two extreme cases can be distinguished : chiral molecules with very long tunneling times and chiral molecules with rapid tunnellings . for former",
    ", we have @xmath89 , giving @xmath90 , chiral states become stationary states and hund s paradox is resolved  @xcite .",
    "so , here we just focus on latter . the free parameters of the molecule can be chosen to be the effective mass @xmath5 , the characteristic energy @xmath10 and the characteristic length @xmath8 .",
    "the effective mass of a typical small chiral molecule ( e.g. , isomeric ammonia , nhdt ) is estimated as @xmath91 .",
    "the two - level approximation requires that @xmath92 , so considering the thermal energy at the room temperature as @xmath93 , we estimate the typical value of characteristic energy as @xmath94 .",

    "corresponding to the symmetric double - well potential , the dynamics ( blue plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1],a ) shows symmetric oscillations between two chiral states .",
    "introducing the asymmetry into the unitary dynamics reduces the symmetry of the oscillations , eventually confining them to the initial chiral state ( brown and green plots in fig .",

    "this oscillatory dynamics is the quantum signature of the system . at a definite time",
    ", the probability of the right - handed state is decreased quickly with the asymmetry parameter , @xmath7 , ( fig .  [ fig1],b ) .",
    "this is because the chiral interactions overcome tunneling process , and thus confine the molecule in the initial chiral state .",
    "+ a molecule , especially in a biological environment , is not really isolated .",
    "the environmental effects on the molecule may be classified into _ decoherence _ and _ dissipation_. the former is the suppression of the relative phases ( coherences ) between the states of the molecule .",
    "the decoherence in the energy basis of the molecule is usually called dephasing . in our approach",
    ", the decoherence effect is characterized by the third term of ( [ 26 ] ) .",
    "the latter is the energy exchange with the environment leading to thermalization which is usually accompanied by decoherence . in our approach , first and second terms of ( [ 26 ] ) are responsible for dissipation effect . in order to examine the dynamics of the open chiral molecule ,",
    "first we should specify the type of the environment .",
    "the interaction of the molecule with a dilute environment can be approximately accounted by two - body collisions .",
    "a gas phase is a generic example of such an environment .",
    "a gas phase is not actually a collection of harmonic oscillators .",
    "in fact , the fluctuating force produced by the gas particles onto molecule is not gaussian ( as it would be for oscillators ) , but rather looks like a series of random delta peaks . nevertheless ,",
    "if every collision is sufficiently weak , then fluctuating force could still approximately considered as gaussian ( when averaged over longer time scales , including many collisions ) . for the gas phase",
    "we obtain a simple expression for the right - handed state dynamics .",

    "the dephasing effects of the gas phase are manifested in @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "+ in order to examine the dynamics explicitly , we should specify the spectral density of the gas phase . as harris and stodolsky demonstrated , the relevant dynamics of chiral states samples the velocity distribution of the gas molecules , which is strongly temperature - dependent  @xcite . starting from a microscopic model of the collisions with the gas particles ,",
    "we derive the spectral density @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the interaction - picture position operator of the environmental particles . note that for simplicity we drop all normalization factors expressed by @xmath126 .",
    "the interaction process envisaged here is a sequence of collisions between gas particles and a heavier chiral molecule .",
    "we also assume that the collision does nt lead to any internal transition of the molecule .",
    "the position operator of the environmental particles can be expanded as  @xcite @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the interaction function and @xmath129 is the difference between the gas density operator @xmath130 and its time - averaged value , assumed to be the uniform gas density @xmath131 .",

    "thus , we ignore the term @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) . for a gaussian interaction function @xmath153 , and assuming @xmath154 , the explicit form of the spectral density would be @xmath155 with coupling strength @xmath156 and cut - off frequency @xmath157 . the spectral density ( [ 40 ] )",
    "shows a sub - ohmic frequency dependence with a temperature - dependent coupling strength and cut - off frequency . at the room temperature , assuming the dilute gas limit , we estimate @xmath158 , and @xmath159 .",
    "+      in a condensed environment , since the medium is always present , the idea of collision is inapplicable .",
    "the properties of such an environment can be encapsulated in an ohmic spectral density with an exponential cutoff @xmath75 as @xmath160 in which @xmath161 is a measure of the system - environment coupling strength .",
    "a condensed environment is more appropriate to represent a biological environment .",
    "the interaction of the molecule with a biological environment is , by nature , complex .",
    "we assume that the chiral molecule is surrounded by a uniform polar solvent . for simplicity",
    ", we describe the solvation process by the well - known onsager model  @xcite .",
    "the chiral molecule is treated as a point dipole which is surrounded by a spherical cage of polar solvent molecules with onsager radius @xmath162 , which is typically the size of the molecule . for a debye",
    "solvent , the parameters of the spectral density can be written as  @xcite @xmath163 and @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the difference between the dipole moment of the molecule in the ground and excited states , @xmath166 and @xmath167 are the static and high - frequency dielectric constants of the solvent , and @xmath168 is the debye relaxation time of the solvent . for water as the most prevalent solvent we have @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171  @xcite .",

    "that if @xmath173 , the environmental particles can not resolve the molecular states and thus the quantum oscillations resulted from tunneling process preserves .",

    "<S> we examine the dynamics of chiral states of chiral molecules with high tunneling rates in dilute and condensed phases in the context of time - dependent perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral molecule is effectively described by an asymmetric double - well potential , whose asymmetry is a measure of chiral interactions . the dilute and condensed phases are conjointly described by a collection of harmonic oscillators but respectively with temperature - dependent sub - ohmic and temperature - independent ohmic spectral densities . </S>",
    "<S> we examine our method quantitatively by applying the dynamics to isotopic ammonia molecule , nhdt , in an inert background gas ( as the dilute phase ) and in water ( as the condensed phase ) . as </S>",
    "<S> different spectral densities implies , the extension of the dynamics from the dilute phase to the condensed phase is not trivial . while the dynamics in the dilute phase leads to racemization , the chiral interactions in the condensed phase induce the quantum zeno effect . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , contrary to the condensed phase , the short - time dynamics in the dilute phase is sensitive to the initial state of the chiral molecule and to the strength of the coupling between the molecule and the environment . </S>"
