    "there is increasing expectation that general relativity is only the low - energy effective theory of gravitation .",
    "this belief originates mainly in the lack of the singularity avoidance of the theory and its still existing failure to be merged with quantum principles .",
    "string theory suggests that the five - dimensional einstein gravity containing our four - dimensional ( 4d ) world as a brane @xcite - @xcite may be a better approximation . in the original randall - sundrum ( rs )",
    "setup @xcite , a flat brane was symmetrically embedded into a 5-dimensional anti de sitter ( ads5 ) space - time ( the bulk ) .",
    "later on , generalizations of the model to curved branes and more generic bulk space - times were advanced . in such models , on the brane",
    ", gravity is governed by a modified einstein equation @xcite : @xmath5where @xmath6 denotes a quadratic expression in the energy - momentum tensor @xmath7 : @xmath8and @xmath9 represents the electric part of the weyl curvature of the bulk .",
    "the brane gravitational constant @xmath10 and the brane cosmological constant  @xmath0 are related to the bulk gravitational constant @xmath11 , bulk cosmological constant @xmath12 and the ( positive ) brane tension @xmath13 through @xmath14 in such a scenario our observable universe can be imagined as a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) brane moving in a static schwarzschild - anti de sitter ( sads5 ) background .",
    "cosmology is modified accordingly , however there is no room left for brane - black holes in this model , which are merely test particles on the brane .    the most simple extension of black holes in higher - dimensional gravity is represented by black strings .",
    "if black strings populate the bulk , then they penetrate the brane and schwarzschild black holes emerge . on the brane",
    ", black holes could be introduced in the most simple way by a cut and paste method . replacing spheres removed from the flrw brane with vacuum regions centered around schwarzschild black holes we obtain a swiss - cheese model . in principle",
    "such a model could be a more realistic description of the universe than the flrw brane , as it contains schwarzschild black holes with _ finite mass _ in the cosmological background .",
    "the cosmological consequences can be important , as for example the original general relativistic swiss - cheese model , the einstein - straus model @xcite has predicted a modified luminosity - redshift relation @xcite .",
    "it is well known , that in the context of the generalized rs brane - worlds , the generic _ spherically symmetric _ black holes are characterized by both a mass @xmath15 and a tidal charge @xmath16 , the latter originating from the electric part of the bulk weyl curvature @xcite .",
    "thus spherically symmetric brane black holes resemble the reissner - nordstrm solutions , but the tidal charge can take negative values as well , in contrast with general relativity , where @xmath17 represents the square of the electric charge @xmath18 . in spite of the fact that the bulk solution containing such a brane is unknown ,",
    "various astrophysical phenomena were already studied in this scenario , like gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "the tidal charge term represents a correction to the schwarzschild potential , which scales as @xmath19 ( @xmath20 being the distance measured from the center of symmetry ) .",
    "this correction term comes from the weyl curvature of the bulk ( from the @xmath21 source term ) and it is in fact the most important piece of information we have about the bulk containing the tidal charged brane black hole .",
    "we remark here that the perturbative analysis of the gravitational field of a spherically symmetric source in the weak field limit , in the context of the original rs setup has shown other type of corrections to the schwarzschild potential ( which depend on the curvature radius of the fifth dimension ) @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these scale as @xmath22 , thus they are different from the correction induced by the tidal charge in the tidal charged black hole solution .",
    "this shows that the bulk containing the tidal charged black hole brane , under no circumstances can _ _",
    "_ _ behave as a linearly perturbed ads5 space - time .",
    "this is the second information we have about the bulk containing the tidal charged brane black hole .",
    "the same holds true for the simplest black hole on the brane , given by the schwarzschild solution ( with @xmath23 ) .",
    "as the schwarzschild potential does not have any @xmath22 correction term in this case , the bulk containing the schwarzschild brane black hole is again not a linearly perturbed ads5 space - time .",
    "remarkably , we do know more on the extension into the bulk of the schwarzschild brane black hole , than of the generic tidal charged black hole .",
    "as conjectured in @xcite , a schwarzschild brane black hole can be embedded in the bulk only by extending the singularity into the bulk .",
    "therefore a black string with singular ads horizon emerges .",
    "recently , the gravity wave perturbations of such a black - string brane - world were computed @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed , that due to the gregory - laflamme instability @xcite the black string will shortly decay into a black cigar @xcite .",
    "however , more recently it was shown that under very mild assumptions , classical event horizons can not pinch off @xcite .",
    "the configuration we propose to study in this paper is schematically represented on fig [ fig1 ] .",
    "the brane is flrw and it contains a number of schwarzschild voids .",
    "irrespective of which region we are on the brane , the electric part of the bulk weyl curvature is switched off . while this is customary for the cosmological regions ( then the bulk becomes ads5 and there is no dark radiation on the respective brane regions ) , it does not represent an obvious choice for black strings .",
    "as motivation , we note that stable black string solutions with @xmath24 arise in the two brane models , introduced in ref . @xcite .",
    "such black strings extending between the physical brane and a `` shadow brane '' were already employed as a model of brane - world black holes @xcite , and we follow the same choice here .",
    "a difficult problem would be to find the global bulk solution for this highly asymmetric configuration .",
    "we propose again the cut and paste method here , by inserting a transition zone between the black string / cigar metric and the ads5 regions . as the exact shape of these regions",
    "is not fixed a priori , we conjecture that by choosing an appropriate shape for these regions , the boundary problem becomes solvable .",
    "we do not propose to further discuss this topic here , but rather concentrate on the existence of the brane cosmological solution , in the same spirit as brane stellar solutions were discussed in @xcite-@xcite , weak gravitational lensing in mm , strong lensing in @xcite and galactic rotation curves in makharko .",
    "in @xcite the swiss - cheese brane - world model was already studied , assuming @xmath24 . by allowing for a cosmological constant @xmath0 in the flrw regions the possibility of having different brane tensions @xmath13 in the flrw and schwarzschild regions of the brane , and / or having",
    "different cosmological constants @xmath25 in the bulk regions surrounding them was raised .",
    "the junction conditions on the brane have been derived and it has been shown that for _ static _ cosmological fluid no such brane ( beside the empty one , the minkowski brane ) can exist .    in section 2",
    "we present the simplest examples of _ dynamic _ swiss - cheese universes on the brane .",
    "these consist of black strings / cigars penetrating a cosmological flrw brane without dark radiation .",
    "the intersections appear on the brane as schwarzschild spheres .",

    "thus a negative energy density @xmath3 can be turned positive by the above redefinition , provided @xmath0 is a sufficiently large positive constant .    due to the non - linear source terms @xmath6 in the modified einstein equation ( [ mode ] )",

    "however in brane - world gravity an other transformation is possible to the new fluid variables ( @xmath75):@xmath76with the result that the cosmological constant is absorbed into the new fluid variables .",

    "we conclude that in this brane - world model the evolution of the cosmological fluid is realistic only for @xmath2 . for any positive @xmath0",
    "a negative energy density appears , which clearly represents exotic matter . in these cases however the cosmological constant",

    "approaches the general relativistic transformation , while in the high energy / early universe regime ( @xmath80 ) it approaches the identical transformation ( @xmath81 ) @xmath82 ( @xmath72 ) , irrespective of the actual value of @xmath0 .",
    "the question then comes , what is than the invariant meaning of @xmath0 ?",
    "originally it was introduced in the model as the cosmological constant in the flrw regions @xmath83 .",
    "if we also allow for a cosmological constant @xmath84 in the voids ( so that they become schwarzschild - de sitter or schwarzschild anti de sitter regions instead schwarzschild black holes ) , then the junction conditions and the modified gravitational dynamics on the brane give the model presented here , but with @xmath85 .",
    "therefore if we allow for the same cosmological constant in both regions on the brane , then @xmath61 and only the evolution presented on fig [ fig2 ] occurs .",
