    "the fundamental question of the nature of inertial mass is not solved up to now .",
    "success of newton s conception of physical force influencing on a separated body may be explained by the fact that the _ geometric counterpart to the force @xmath0 - acceleration @xmath1 in some inertial frame _ was found with the simplest relation @xmath2 to the mass @xmath3 of a body . the consistent formulation of mechanical laws has been realized in galilean inertial systems .",
    "the class of the inertial systems contains ( by a convention ) the one unique inertial system - the system of remote stars and any reference frame moving with constant velocity relative these remote stars .",
    "then , on the abstract mathematical level arose a  space \" - the linear euclidean space with appropriate vector operations on forces , momenta , velocities , etc .",
    "general relativity and new astronomical observations concerning accelerated expansion of universe show that all these constructions are only a good approximation , at best .    the line of galileo - newton - mach and einstein ( with serious reservations about conception of the  space \" ) argumentations made accent on some absolute global reference frame associated with the system of remote stars .",
    "this point of view looks as absolutely necessary for the classical formulation of the inertial principle itself .",
    "this fundamental principle has been formulated , say ,  externally \" , i.e. as if one looks on some massive body perfectly isolated from rest universe . in such approach only  mechanical \" state of relative motion of bodies expressed by their coordinates in space has been taken into account .",
    "nevertheless , newton clearly saw some weakness of such approach .",
    "his famous example of rotating bucket with water shows that there is an absolute motion since the water takes on a concave shape in any reference frame .",
    "here we are very close to different -  internal \" formulation of the inertia principle and , probably , to understanding the quantum nature of inertial mass .",
    "namely , the  absolute motion \" of a body should be turned towards not outward , to distant stars , but inward  to the deformation of the body .",
    "this means that external force not only changes the inertial character of its motion : body accelerates , moreover  the body deforms .",
    "two aspects of a force action : acceleration relative inertial reference frame and deformation of the body are very important already on the classical level as it has been shown by newton s bucket rotation .",
    "the second aspect is especially important for quantum  particles \" since the acceleration requires the point - like localization in space - time ; such localization is , however , very problematic in quantum theory .",
    "nevertheless , almost all discussions in foundations of quantum theory presume that space - time structure is close with an acceptable accuracy to the minkowski geometry and may be used without changes in quantum theory up to planck s scale or up to topologically different space - time geometry of string theories . under such approach , one loses the fact that space - time relationships and geometry for quantum objects should be reformulated totally _ at any space - time distance _ since from the quantum point of view such fundamental dynamical variables as  time - of - arrival \" of aharonov _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) and a position operator of foldy & wouthuysen ( f .- w . )",
    "( 1950 ) and newton & wigner ( 1949 ) representations are state - dependent ( leifer , 1997,1998,2004,2005,2007,2009,2010 ) . therefore space - time itself should be built in the frameworks of a new  quantum geometry \" .",
    "in such a situation , one should make accent on the second aspect of the force action  the body deformation .",
    "in fact , microscopically , it is already a _ different body _ with different temperature , etc . , since the state of body is changed ( leifer , 1988 ) . in the case of inertial motion one has the opposite situation  the internal state of the body does not change , i.e. body is self - identical during inertial space - time motion . in fact",
    "this is the basis of all classical physics .",
    "generally , space - time localization being treated as ability of coordinate description of an object in classical relativity closely connected with operational identification of  events \" ( see ( einstein , 1905 ) ) .",
    "it is tacitly assumed that all classical objects ( frequently represented by material points ) are self - identical and they can not disappear during inertial motion because of the energy - momentum conservation law . the inertia law of galileo - newton ascertains this self - conservation  externally \" .",
    "but objectively this means that _ physical state of body ( temporary in somewhat indefinite sense ) does not depend on the choice of the inertial reference frame_. one may accept this statement as an  internal \" formulation of the inertial law that should be of course formulated mathematically .",
    "i put here some plausible reasonings leading to such a formulation .    up to now the localization problem of quantum systems in the space - time",
    "is connected in fact with the fundamental classical notion of potential energy and force .",
    "einstein and schrdinger already discussed the inconsistency of usage such purely classical notions together with the quantum law of motion and the concepts of  particle \" and  acceleration \" as well ( see one of the letter of einstein to schrdinger ( einstein , 1950 ) , and the article ( einstein , 1953 ) ) . but these messages are left almost without attention by the physical community .",
    "now one should pay the bill .",
    "newton s force is the physical reason for the _ absolute _ change of the character of a body motion expressed by _ acceleration",
    "_ serves as geometric counterpart to the force ( curvature of the world line in newtonian space and time is now non - zero ) .",
    "however there is no adequate geometric notion in quantum theory since , for example , the notion of trajectory of quantum system in space - time was systematically banned .",
    "the energy of interaction expressed by a hamiltonian @xmath4 is in some sense an analoge of a classical force .",
    "generally , this interaction leads to the absolute change ( deformation ) of the quantum state ( leifer , 1998 ) .",
    "notice , quantum state is in fact the state of motion ( dirac,1928 ) .",
    "such motion takes the place in a state space modeled frequently by some hilbert space @xmath5 .",
    "but there is no geometric counterpart to @xmath4 in such functional space . in order to establish the geometric counterpart to @xmath4",
    "it is useful initially to clarify the important question : what is the quantum content of a classical force , if any ?",
    "let me use a small droplet of mercury as simple example of macroscopic system .",
    "the free droplet of mercury is in the state of the inertial motion  whether it be of rest , or of moving uniformly forward in a straight line \" .",
    "in fact this statement means that physical states of the droplet ( its internal degrees of freedom ) being in inertial motion are physically non - distinguishable .",
    "the force applied to the droplet breaks the inertial character of its motion and deforms its surface , changes its surface tension temperature , etc .",
    "in fact an external force perturbs goldstone s modes supporting the droplet as a macro - system ( umezawa , matsumoto & tachiki , 1982 ) and micro - potentials acting on any internal quantum particle , say , electrons inside of the droplet .",
    "it means that quantum states and their deformations may serve as a  detector \" of the  external force \" action on the droplet .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to use quantum state deformations as a counterpart instead of classical acceleration , since generally acceleration depends on mass , charge , etc .",
    ", that is impossible to establish a pure space - time geometrically invariant counterpart of a classical force independent on a material body .",
    "only a classical gravitation force may be geometrized assuming the gravitation field may be replaced locally by an accelerated reference frame since in the general relativity ( gr ) the gravitation field and accelerated reference frame are locally non - distinguishable .",
    "there is , however , a more serious reason why space - time acceleration can not serves as the completely robust geometric counterpart of the force .",
    "the physical state of the droplet freely falling in the gravitation field of a star is non - distinguishable from the physical state of the droplet in an remote from stars area .",
    "it means that from the point of view of the  physical state \" of the droplet , the class of the inertial systems may be supplemented by a reference frame freely falling in a gravitation field .",
    "therefore macroscopic space - time acceleration can not serve as a discriminator of physical state of body .",
    "thus , instead of choosing , say , the system of distant stars as an  outer \" absolute reference frame ( einstein , 1916 ) the deformation of quantum state of some particle of the droplet may be used .",
    "it means that the deformation of quantum motion in quantum state space serves as an",
    " internal detector \" for  accelerated \" space - time motion .",
    "this deformation being discussed from the quantum point of view gives the alternative way for the connection of @xmath4 action with a _ new geometric counterpart of interaction - coset structure of the quantum state space_. it means that instead of absolute external reference frame of remote stars one may use  internal \" , in fact a quantum reference frame ( leifer , 2010,2009,1997,2007,2004,1998,2005 ) .",
    "there is different description of accelerated electron in the thermalized vacuum ( unruh , 1976 ) , ( bell & leinaas , 1983 ) , ( bell & leinaas , 1986 ) , ( myhrvold , 1985 ) . avoiding detailed analysis",
    "i should note that any variant of such description uses the interaction of  detector \" with quantum field embedded in single space - time where the acceleration has absolute sense .",
    "indeed , unruh temperature @xmath6 is proportional to the acceleration @xmath7 .",
    "relative what reference frame ?",
    "say , freely falling electron is definitely  accelerated \" relative remote stars , but its quantum state should be the same as the quantum state of  free \" electron in remote from masses area .",
    "therefore , i have assumed that the equivalence of pure quantum state of single free and freely falling electron ( leifer , 2009 ) .",
    "then the _ deformations of quantum motion generated by the coset action in the quantum state space will be used as an invariant counterpart of a  quantum force \" applied to self - interacting electron in dynamical space - time_. it means nothing but in the developing theory _ a distance between quantum states in the state space should replace a distance between  bodies \" in space - time as the primary geometric notion_. thus , the mathematical formulation of the quantum inertia law requires the intrinsic unification of relativity and quantum principles .",
    "the mentioned above the localization problem in space - time and connected with this deep difficulties of divergences in quantum field theory ( qft ) insist to find a new primordial quantum element instead of the classical  material point \" .",
    "such element is the quantum motion - the quantum state of a system ( dirac , 1928 ) .",
    "quantum states of single quantum particles may be represented by vectors @xmath8 of linear functional hilbert space @xmath5 with finite or countable number of dimensions .",
    "it is very important to note that the correspondence between quantum state and its vectors representation in @xmath5 is not isomorphic .",
    "it is rather homomorphic , when a full equivalence class of proportional vectors , so - called rays @xmath9 , where @xmath10 corresponds to one quantum state .",
    "the rays of quantum states may be represented by points of complex projective hilbert space @xmath11 or its finite dimension subspace @xmath12 .",
    "points of @xmath12 represent generalized coherent states ( gcs ) that will be used thereafter as fundamental physical concept instead of  material point \" .",
    "this space will be treated as the space of _  unlocated quantum states \" _ in the analog of the _  space of unlocated shapes \" _ of ( shapere & wilczek , 1989 ) .",
    "the problem we will dealing with is the lift the quantum dynamics from @xmath12 into the _ space of located quantum states_. that is , the difference with the shapere & wilczek construction is that not a self - deformation of 3d - shapes should be represented by motions of a spatial reference frame but the unlocated quantum states should be represented by the motions of  field - shell \" in dynamical space - time .",
    "two simple observations may serve as the basis of the intrinsic unification of relativity and quantum principles . the first observation concerns interference of quantum amplitudes in a fixed quantum setup .",
    "a. the linear interference of quantum amplitudes shows the symmetries relative space - time transformations of whole setup .",
    "this interference has been studied in  standard \" quantum theory .",
    "such symmetries reflects , say , the _ first order of relativity _ : the physics is same if any _ complete setup _ subject ( kinematical , not dynamical ! ) shifts , rotations , boosts as whole in single minkowski space - time . according to our notes given above one should add to this list a freely falling quantum setup ( super - relativity ) .",
    "the second observation concerns a dynamical  deformation \" of some quantum setup .",
    "b. if one dynamically changes the setup configuration or its  environment \" , then the amplitude of an event will be generally changed .",
    "nevertheless there is a different type of tacitly assumed symmetry that may be formulated on the intuitive level as the invariance of physical properties of  quantum particles \" , i.e. the invariance of their quantum numbers like mass , spin , charge , etc . , relative variation of quantum amplitudes",
    "this means that properties of , say , physical electrons in two different setups @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the same .",
    "_ one may postulate that the invariant content of this physical properties may be kept if one makes the infinitesimal variation of some  flexible quantum setup \" reached by a small variation of some fields by adjustment of tuning devices .",
    "_    there is an essential technical approach capable to connect super - relativity and the quantum inertia law .",
    "namely , a new concept of local dynamical variable ( ldv ) ( leifer , 2004 ) should be introduced for the realization of infinitesimal variation of a  flexible quantum setup \" .",
    "this construction is naturally connected with methods developed in studying geometric phase ( berry , 1989 ) .",
    "i seek , however , conservation laws for ldv s in the quantum state space .",
    "the idealized separation of a quantum system from the rest of universe and its cyclic evolution under parameters variation of a hamiltonian in adiabatic and beyond the adiabatic approximation last time mostly discussed in the framework of geometric phase ( berry , 1989 ) .",
    "( aharonov & anandan 1987,1988 ) found non - adiabatic generalization of berry construction interesting in following important direction .",
    "aharonov & anandan used the general setting for the geometric phase in terms of connection in fibre bundles over projective hilbert space .",
    "such approach is important since instead of external parameters of the hamiltonian , the local projective coordinates of a quantum state itself have been used . for",
    "us will be interesting just the invariant classification of quantum motions ( leifer , 1997 ) .",
    "these invariant classifications are the quantum analog of classical conditions of the inertial and accelerated motions .",
    "they are rooted into the global geometry of the dynamical group @xmath15 manifold .",
    "namely , the geometry of @xmath16 , the isotropy group @xmath17 of the pure quantum state , and the coset @xmath18=cp(n-1)$ ] geometry , play an essential role in classification of quantum state motions ( leifer , 1997 ) .",

    "will be studied .",
    "what is the physical reason of application @xmath15 group geometry to the state of motion of quantum particles ?",
    "just because we try study the motion of internal degrees of freedom in the space of _  unlocated quantum states \" _ @xmath12 .",
    "this is the simplest and , probably , the fundamental case is the case of  isolated \" ,  free \" but self - interacting quantum particles in pure quantum state whose _ inertial motions _ could be geometrically analyzed without any reference to the external interaction with a  second particle \" .",
    "geometric analysis of quantum state dynamics requires the introduction of a new quantum ldv s and a new method of their  dynamical identification \" by a comparison .",
    "i introduce the ldv s corresponding to the internal @xmath15 dynamical group symmetry of quantum states and its breakdown .",
    "these ldv s may be naturally expressed in terms of the following local coordinates @xmath22 @xmath23[11 ] since @xmath15 acts effectively only on the space of rays , i.e. on the classes of equivalence of quantum states differentiating by a non - zero complex multiplier .",
    "ldv s will be represented by linear combinations of @xmath15 generators in local coordinates of @xmath12 equipped with the fubini - study metric @xmath24(1 + \\sum |\\pi^s|^2)^{-2}.\\]][2 ] hence the internal dynamical variables and their norms should be state - dependent , i.e. local in the state space .",
    "these local dynamical variables realize a non - linear representation of the unitary global @xmath15 group in the hilbert state space @xmath25 .",
    "namely , @xmath26 generators of @xmath27 may be divided in accordance with the cartan decomposition : @xmath28 \\in h , [ b , h ] \\in b , [ b , b ] \\in h$ ] .",

    "the anholonomy of the wave function arose due to slowly variable environment was widely discussed by berry and many other authors in the framework of so - called geometric phases ( berry , 1989 ) .",
    "it is clear that now we deal with different problem : _ berry made accent on variation of wave function during finite cyclic evolution whereas for us interesting the quantum invariants of infinitesimal variation of the quantum setup_.    the geometric phase is an intrinsic property of the family of eigenstates .",
    "there are in fact a set of local dynamical variables ( ldv ) that like the geometric phase intrinsically depends on eigenstates . for us will be interesting vector fields @xmath45 associated with the reaction of quantum state @xmath22 on the action of internal  unitary field \" @xmath39 given by @xmath46 .    in view of the future discussion of infinitesimal unitary transformations , it is useful to compare _ velocity _ of variation of the berry s phase @xmath47[7 ] where @xmath48 with the affine parallel transport of the vector field @xmath49 given by the equations @xmath50[8 ] the parallel transport of berry is similar but it is not identical to the affine parallel transport .",

    "such construction perfectly fits for the quantum formulation of the quantum inertia principle ( leifer , 2010 ) since the affine parallel transport of energy - momentum vector field in @xmath12 expresses the self - conservation and conditions of stability of , say , electron .",
