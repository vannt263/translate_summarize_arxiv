    "quasinormal modes of black holes have been studied ever since the seminal work of vishveshwara @xcite and press @xcite in the early 1970s .",
    "it soon became evident that exponentially damped mode - oscillations will dominate most processes involving perturbed black holes ( see @xcite for references ) .",
    "this means that the quasinormal modes provide a unique opportunity to identify a black hole , a possibility that hopefully will become reality when large - scale laser - interferometric detectors for gravitational waves come into operation in the near future @xcite . in order to extract as",
    "much information as possible from a gravitational - wave signal it is important that we understand exactly how the quasinormal modes depend on the parameters of the black hole .",
    "the parameters of main astrophysical importance are the black holes mass and angular momentum .",
    "that is , the kerr solution is the most relevant one from an astrophysical point of view .",
    "the solution that describes an electrically charged , nonrotating black hole  due to reissner and nordstrm  is of less direct importance because it seems unlikely that black holes with a considerable charge will exist in the universe .",
    "nevertheless , the reissner - nordstrm solution has several interesting features that warrant a closer inspection .",
    "the most intriguing one concerns the possible conversion of electromagnetic energy into gravitational energy and vice versa : in a charged environment an electromagnetic wave will inevitably give rise to gravitational waves .",
    "the reissner - nordstrm metric provides the simplest framework for studies of this effect .    for this and several other reasons",
    "there has been a number of studies of perturbed reissner - nordstrm black holes .",
    "the equations governing a weak ( massless ) field in the geometry of an electrically charged black hole were first derived by zerilli @xcite and moncrief @xcite . basically , these equations can be i ) split into axial and polar perturbations ( also known as odd and even parity , respectively ) and then ii ) reduced to two decoupled wave equations in each case .",
    "the final wave equations describe two variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 , from which all components of the electromagnetic field and the perturbed metric can be reconstructed .",
    "in general , both @xmath2 and @xmath3 correspond to a combination of electromagnetic waves and gravitational ones , but in the limiting case of an uncharged black hole the two functions reduce to pure electromagnetic and gravitational waves , respectively .",
    "originally , the perturbation equations were used to study the stability of the metric @xcite .",
    "later the equations were used to investigate the already mentioned conversion of electromagnetic energy into gravitational @xcite",
    ". there has also been several studies of quasinormal modes for reissner - nordstrm black holes @xcite .",
    "but although the methods used in those studies provide accurate numerical results there is still need for more information .",
    "specifically , one would like to know what happens to the quasinormal modes as the black hole becomes extremely charged .",
    "there are two parts to this problem , that seemingly must be studied separately . in the typical case each of the two horizons , at @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the mass and @xmath6 the charge of the hole ) , correspond to a second order singularity in the linearized equations .",
    "but in the extreme case these two singularities merge ( at @xmath7 ) into a single one of fourth order .",
    "this means that the methods that have been devised to determine the entire spectrum of quasinormal modes break down in the extreme limit @xcite .",
    "even though the extremely charged case is only of theoretical interest it is worth considering .",
    "one reason ( apart from natural curiosity ) is the fact that the existence of two coalescing horizons is a prominent feature also of rapidly rotating black holes . thus one may hope that a study of the mode - behaviour as @xmath8 can lead to some insights also for the rotating case . or at least that methods that prove reliable for high charge can be adapted to the kerr case .",
    "recently leaver s continued fraction method was amended in such a way that it could be applied to the case of extreme charge @xcite .",
    "although it seems plausible that other methods , such as the numerical integration of andersson @xcite , can be extended in a similar way there has been no attempts to do this .",
    "anyway , at present the main question concerns the reliability of the various approaches for nearly extreme black holes .",
    "it is clear that the methods in @xcite will break down for @xmath9 , and also that the method of onozawa _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite can be used only for the extreme case .",
    "thus , we do not yet know to what extent the available results for high charge ( and perhaps also rapid rotation in the case of kerr @xcite ) can be trusted .",
    "the work presented in this paper was motivated by a desire to obtain a better understanding of this issue .",
    "we also wanted to unveil the detailed behaviour of the quasinormal modes as the charge of the black hole was increased . specifically , previous evidence ( see figure 1 in @xcite and figures 2 and 3 in @xcite ) indicate that this behaviour is somewhat peculiar for the higher overtones of the black hole . as we will show in the following section , the behaviour of the highly damped reissner - nordstrm quasinormal modes is , indeed , very strange .",
    "since the equations that describe a perturbed reissner - nordstrm black hole are available in the literature ( most notably in chandrasekhar s exhaustive book @xcite ) we will not list them here .",
    "for the present discussion it is sufficient to know that the equations take the general form @xmath10 \\psi = 0 \\ , \\label{rweq}\\ ] ] where we have assumed that the time - dependence of the perturbation is @xmath11 .",
    "the tortoise coordinate , that is defined by @xmath12 has the effect that the event horizon of the black hole is `` pushed away '' to @xmath13 .",
    "the function @xmath14 can be either an axial ( odd parity ) or polar ( even parity ) perturbation of the black hole . also , for each case there are two different functions , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , that correspond to pure electromagnetic and gravitational waves in the schwarzschild limit . in total",
    "there are thus four equations , all with slightly different effective potentials . for obvious reasons",
    "this difference in the potentials leads to somewhat different quasinormal modes for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "analogously , one might expect the quasinormal modes for axial and polar perturbations to be different .",
    "but , as pointed out by chandrasekhar @xcite , the mathematical theory of black holes is an intricately entangled web where many quantities are related ( often in a surprising way ) .",
    "thus it turns out that the quasinormal modes for axial and polar perturbations are identical .",
    "the underlying reason is that two effective potentials can , although different , contain much the same physical information .",
    "this means that it is sufficient to restrict a study of the reissner - nordstrm problem to either the axial or the polar case .",
    "once @xmath2 and @xmath3 are found for one kind of perturbation the corresponding solutions for the other case are easily generated @xcite .",
    "the quasinormal modes of a black hole correspond to solutions to eq .",
    "( [ rweq ] ) that satisfy the causal condition that no information should leak out through the event horizon of the black hole , and at the same time correspond to purely outgoing waves at spatial infinity .",
    "this means that a typical mode - solution will behave like @xmath15 since one would expect the black hole to be stable against a small perturbation the mode - frequencies should be complex .",
    "this implies that an identification of quasinormal modes is non - trivial .",
    "in order for a mode - solution to be damped with time at a fixed @xmath16 the frequency @xmath17 must have a negative imaginary part .",
    "but then the corresponding solution will diverge both at the event horizon and spatial infinity [ cf .",
    "( [ asymp ] ) ] at a fixed time .",
    "several methods have been devised to deal with this difficulty .",
    "most notable are leaver s continued fraction approach @xcite and andersson s complex - coordinate integration method @xcite .",
    "these two methods provide highly accurate numerical results also for rapidly damped modes .",
    "furthermore , both methods have been used to study the first few quasinormal modes for reissner - nordstrm black holes .    as already mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "it is clear that all existent methods will fail for a nearly extreme black hole .",
    "the reason is that the two horizons of the black hole merge as @xmath8 , and this changes the singularity structure of the problem ( this is easy to see if eq .",
    "( [ rweq ] ) is expanded in such a way that all derivatives are taken with respect to @xmath18 rather than @xmath16 ) .",
    "thus , the extreme case must be considered separately .",
    "this was recently done by onozawa _",
    "_ @xcite . as a test of the reliability of that study , and also to provide a better understanding of the behaviour of the quasinormal modes for highly charged black holes we decided to make an exhaustive study of the problem .",
    "we made detailed calculations [ using both the continued fraction method @xcite and numerical integration @xcite to make sure that the results were reliable ] for the first nine dipole ( @xmath19 ) modes of @xmath2 and the first nine quadrupole ( @xmath20 ) modes of @xmath3 .",
    "these are the lowest radiating multipoles for each case . in general",
    "one finds , just as for schwarzschild black holes @xcite , that the mode - behaviour is similar for higher values of @xmath21 .",
    "the results of this investigation are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "we now proceed to discuss them in more detail .      for the first few modes the behaviour of the mode - frequencies is readily described .",
    "the damping rate typically reaches a maximum for @xmath22 , and the oscillation frequency generally increases with @xmath23 .",
    "this is clear from the results for @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . moreover , this behaviour agrees with the understanding from the wkb approximation @xcite .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to verify that , when the lowest order of approximation is used , the wkb formulae suggest the following approximate behaviour ( for the slowest damped mode ) @xmath25^{1/2 } \\ , \\ ] ] @xmath26^{1/2 } \\left [ { 3m\\over r_0 }   -{4q^2 \\over r_0 ^ 2 } \\right]^{1/2 } \\ , \\ ] ] in the limit @xmath27 . here",
    "we have defined @xmath28 as the position where the black - hole potential attains its maximum value .",
    "this means that @xmath29 .",
    "that is , @xmath28 corresponds to the position of the unstable , circular photon orbit in the reissner - nordstrm spacetime .    to understand better the physics that lead to this behaviour we can use an argument that is due to goebel @xcite : consider a congruence of null rays circling the black hole in the unstable photon orbit",
    "to circle the black hole would require a coordinate time @xmath30 the fundamental mode frequency then follows ( if the beam contains @xmath21 cycles ) from @xmath31 in a similar way , one can infer the damping rate of the quasinormal mode from the decay rate of the congruence if the null orbit is slightly perturbed @xcite . from this information it is easy to convince oneself that the oscillation frequency of the modes should increase as @xmath23 increases .",
    "the results for the first few modes in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] agree nicely with this description .",
    "a remarkable fact , that is notable in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is that the dipole frequencies for @xmath2 approach the quadrupole frequencies for @xmath3 as the black hole becomes extreme . this effect was first noted by onozawa _",
    "@xcite ( for a study of the spin-3/2 case , see @xcite ) .",
    "they also showed that this surprising phenomenon arises because the corresponding two effective potentials are related .",
    "that is , the effective potential for @xmath21 and @xmath2 is related to that for @xmath32 and @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , @xmath33 corresponds to @xmath34 .",
    "as is easily verified this is true also for the polar potential , but in that case the relation does not take the simple form of eq .",
    "( c3 ) in @xcite .",
    "while the behaviour for the first few modes have been studied in detail before @xcite there have been no studies of the highly damped modes for reissner - nordstrm black holes .",
    "thus , the results for @xmath35 in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] are new .",
    "they are also truly remarkable . while the behaviour is rather simple for the first modes ( @xmath24 ) ,",
    "the rapidly damped modes show many strange features .",
    "our calculations have discovered a small zoo of seemingly different species .",
    "let us discuss them separately :    * the first surprising feature occurs for @xmath36 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) at a charge @xmath37 : the @xmath3 mode goes through a tiny loop that closes at @xmath38 .",
    "for the following mode ( @xmath39 ) this loop has grown .",
    "several similar loops are obvious in the results for @xmath40 and @xmath2 , and when one continues up the spectrum one finds that these loops are a common feature of many modes .",
    "one interesting aspect of this result is that black holes with different charge may share a specific mode - frequency .",
    "* for a few modes the mode - frequencies approach the negative @xmath41 axis as the charge varies .",
    "then our numerical methods @xcite become unreliable .",
    "this is the reason for the gaps in the data for @xmath40 for @xmath3 and @xmath42 for both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "if these modes cross the axis or not is impossible to say given the available techniques . if they do it would be very surprising , but given the data in our figures it does not seem impossible .",
    "one added peculiarity is that it seems as if some modes are `` multi - valued '' .",
    "that is , for @xmath40 and @xmath3 we find a mode both in the upper branch close to the imaginary axis and in the lower branch for a small range of the black - hole charge ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "a similar behaviour can be observed for @xmath42 and @xmath2 when @xmath44 . at first",
    "this result seems nonsensical and obviously wrong , but it is confirmed by both the continued fraction method and the numerical integration scheme .",
    "this could indicate that it should be taken seriously .",
    "* our study also sheds some light on an issue that has been debated for schwarzschild black holes for some time .",
    "is there a quasinormal mode the imaginary axis at @xmath0 ?",
    "some methods indicate that there should be such a mode , and that it corresponds to @xmath45 .",
    "other methods say that no such mode exists . to resolve this issue",
    "is difficult , basically because none of the proposed methods is reliable close to the axis .",
    "an added complication is that the case @xmath0 is a very special one . that frequency corresponds to a so - called algebraically special perturbation and , as was shown by chandrasekhar @xcite",
    ", one can find analytic solutions to the corresponding perturbation equations .",
    "although one can convince oneself that chandrasekhar s special solutions do not satisfy the quasinormal - mode boundary conditions , the issue is not resolved . to prove the existence of a quasinormal mode one must study the analytic properties close to the mode - frequency , and",
    "this turns out to be difficult in this specific case .",
    "anyway , once the black hole acquires some small charge it is clear that a mode exists ( @xmath45 for @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this mode approaches the suggested value @xmath0 as @xmath46 .",
    "but still this does not prove the existence of a mode for the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "it is plausible that the mode in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and its symmetric counterpart in the left half of the complex @xmath17-plane will coalesce at @xmath47 , and perhaps the two modes that exist for the charged case then cancel each other in some way .",
    "it is also worth mentioning here that there are algebraically special solutions also for the reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "for @xmath48 these correspond to frequencies @xcite @xmath49^{-1 } \\ .\\ ] ] in general we can not see any correlation between these frequencies and the quasinormal modes of the charged black hole . * for higher overtones than those displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the behaviour tends to be qualitatively similar to the presented ones .",
    "the mode - frequency spirals into the value for the extreme black hole .",
    "the spirals get tighter for more rapidly damped modes .",
    "how are we to understand these results ?",
    "well , at present it is very hard to make much sense out of the data presented in fig .",
    "the obvious answer is that the change in the mode - frequencies occurs because the effective potential changes as the charge increases . for the slowly damped modes it is straightforward to show that the oscillation frequency depends on the height of the peak of the potential , while the damping rate is related to the second derivative of @xmath50 at the peak @xcite .",
    "but it is much harder to draw similar conclusions for the rapidly damped modes .",
    "present methods can reliably calculate the mode - frequencies ( and also account for the excitation of the modes in a dynamical process @xcite ) , but we have no clear understanding of the relation between the highly damped modes and the details of the effective potential . on the other hand , we have seen that the mode - frequencies change dramatically as the charge increases from @xmath51 . if one studies the corresponding change in the effective potential , cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] , one can infer that as one approaches the extreme black hole i ) the potential does not change much for @xmath52 , ii ) the peak of the potential stays almost constant , and iii ) the main change in the potential is the fall - off rate as @xmath53 .",
    "this suggests the possibility that the high overtones of the black hole are in some way related to the effective potential close to the horizon . this issue will have to be studied further in the future",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of a detailed study of the quasinormal modes of a reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "our work complements previous studies in several ways . for the first time we have considered i ) the rapidly damped modes , and ii )",
    "how the mode - frequencies approach the anticipated value for the extremely charged black hole .",
    "we have given special attention to the mode - behaviour near the extreme limit .",
    "the two independent algorithms ( from @xcite and @xcite ) that we used for the calculations provide consistent results even for a nearly extreme black hole .",
    "these values are also in nice agreement with the results obtained for the extreme black hole @xcite .",
    "that is , the quasinormal modes converge towards the values for the extreme case as @xmath8 .",
    "we find that while the slowly damped modes can be understood ( for example , by a wkb argument ) , the behaviour of the rapidly damped modes as the charge increases is harder to explain . in general , the modes tend to spiral into the extreme value . moreover , there are cases where the quasinormal modes seem to be double - valued ( in cases when the mode - frequency approaches the imaginary @xmath17-axis ) . at one level , these are just peculiar results without much relevance , but they lead to several questions .",
    "for example ; will the modes of a kerr black hole show similar features ?",
    "this does not seem unlikely , because the kerr problem is in many ways similar to the reissner - nordstrm one .",
    "also in the kerr case will there be two horizons that merge as the black hole becomes extreme .",
    "although the slowest damped modes of the kerr black hole have been calculated @xcite , the rapidly damped ones have not yet been considered . since rotating black holes",
    "should be astrophysically relevant a study of the rapidly damped modes for kerr could yield physically interesting results .",
    "the present study also leads to questions regarding the quasinormal modes themselves : which features of the effective potential govern the behaviour of the rapidly damped modes ? the present evidence ( cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) seems to indicate that the fall - off rate towards the event horizon plays an important role .",
    "but more work is required to answer the question properly . at present",
    "we have to conclude that we still do not have an intuitive understanding of the origin of the rapidly damped black - hole modes .",
    "a final question regards the relevance of the algebraically special modes . in general",
    ", our results do not indicate any relation between the algebraically special mode ( that has a purely imaginary frequency ) and the quasinormal modes for a charged black hole .",
    "but it is well - known that the algebraically special mode coalesces with the ninth gravitational quasinormal mode in the schwarzschild limit .",
    "is there a profound reason for this or is it just a coincidence ? to answer",
    "this question is difficult because all present methods for quasinormal modes break down in the region close to the imaginary frequency axis . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that the algebraically special modes of the kerr black hole move away from the imaginary axis .",
    "hence , it seems likely that a study of the kerr problem may prove illuminating also for this issue .",
    "several questions concerning quasinormal modes thus remain to be resolved .",
    "the present work has contributed a few new pieces to the puzzle , but many other pieces need to be added before the picture becomes completely clear . still , the present results should help us get a better understanding not only of the reissner - nordstrm black hole , but also of the quasinormal - mode phenomenon in general .",
