    "because of the possibility of engineering and probing spin chains , atom by atom , using scanning tunneling microscope , @xcite the study of spin chains is not only a crucial branch in the study strong correlations and quantum magnetism@xcite , but also a frontier in the research of atomic scale spintronics.@xcite spin chains display a vast array of different magnetic states depending on the interplay between spin interactions , size of the chain and their dissipative coupling to the environment .",
    "thus , experiments reveal that different spin chains can behave like quantum antiferromagnets,@xcite classical antiferromagnets,@xcite and classical spin spirals.@xcite when quantum fluctuations do not quench the atomic magnetic moment , classical information can be stored and manipulated in atomically engineered spin chains .",
    "thus , classical nel states can be used to store a bit of information@xcite and the implementation of the nand gate with two antiferromagnetic spin chains@xcite have been demonstrated .",
    "spin waves are relevant excitations in systems that display a ground state with well defined atomic spin magnetic moments , such as ferromagnets , antiferromagnetic nel states , spin spiral states , and skyrmions . here",
    "we study the spin waves of finite size spin chains that present a classical spin spiral ground state .",
    "spin waves have been studied in a variety of finite size systems , including spin chains with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground states , @xcite as well as in skyrmions.@xcite our work is motivated by the recent experimental observation of a stabilized noncollinear chiral ground states in chains of fe pairs deposited on ir(001 ) @xcite ( see fig .",
    "this system@xcite has attracted interest both because of the non - trivial interplay between structure and magnetic coupling,@xcite and because a local perturbation in one side of the chain affects the spin state globally , as a consequence of long range spin , @xcite as in the case of antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains.@xcite the robustness of spin spiral states against formation of domain walls is also considered an advantage.@xcite    our interest on the spin waves in this system is twofold .",
    "first , spin excitations of spin chains , including spin waves , could be probed by means of inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) , @xcite which would provide an additional experimental characterization of the system , complementary to spin polarized magnetometry.@xcite second , spin waves are a source of quantum noise that sets a limit to the capability of sending spin information along the chain .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly discuss the fundamentals of the spin spiral state ground state and the hamiltonian used to describe it . in section iii",
    "we discuss the method to compute the spin wave excitations . in section",

    "v we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "short range isotropic heisenberg exchange naturally yields collinear spin alignments , either ferro or antiferromagnetic .",
    "the competition with a spin coupling that promotes perpendicular alignment , such as the antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction@xcite @xmath0 , naturally results in a non - collinear spin alignment between first neighbors in the plane normal to @xmath1 .",
    "in one dimensional systems the dm term leads to a spin spiral states and in two dimensions promotes the formation of skyrmions.@xcite for the spin chains considered here , the vector @xmath2 is the same for all couplings and lies along the @xmath3 direction , perpendicular to the chain axis @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in these situations ,",
    "any global rotation of the spin spiral in the ( xz ) plane would result in a state with the same energy .",
    "this large degeneracy is broken by the presence of single ion uniaxial anisotropy term that results in a preferred axis so that there are only two classical ground states .",
    "in addition , the uniaxial anisotropy term distorts the spiral , preventing a uniform rotation angle along the chain .",
    "finally , the application of a magnetic field @xmath5 along the @xmath6 direction ( perpendicular both to the chain axis and to @xmath7 ) can further break the symmetry , resulting in a unique ground state .",
    "these four terms are included in the hamiltonian : @xmath8    we study two types of chains .",
    "first we consider a toy model of a mono strand chain , with first neighbor couplings only , @xmath9 and @xmath10 mev and @xmath11 mev .",
    "then we move to a more realistic description of the diatomic fe chains,@xcite that includes couplings up to sixth neighbors , obtained from dft calculations . in both cases",
    "the classical ground state is calculated by minimizing the energy as a function of the magnetic configuration , defined by the orientation of the magnetic moments @xmath12 , that are treated as classical vectors whose lengths remain fixed . the solutions are represented in the figs . 1 and 2 .     direction is applied . ,",

    "the exact numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) , that would yield the spin excitations , it is only possible in systems with a small number of atoms .",
    "therefore , we use the spin wave approximation . the calculation of the spin wave spectrum of the finite size chains is based on the representation of the spin operators in terms of holstein primakoff ( hp ) bosons:@xcite @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the spin direction of the classical ground state on the position @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a bosonic creation operator and @xmath17 is the boson number operator .",
    "the operator @xmath18 measures the deviation of the system from the classical ground state .    the essence of the spin wave calculation is to replace the spin operators in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) by the hp representation and the truncation up to quadratic order in the bosonic operators .",
    "terms linear in the bosonic operators vanish when the expansion is done around the correct classical ground state .",
    "this approach has been widely used in the calculations of spin waves for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground states.@xcite a generalized technique for hp approach in non - collinear systems has been developed .",
    "@xcite after a lengthy calculation detailed in the appendix , we obtain the following spin wave hamiltonian : @xmath19    the specific values of elements @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the spin - wave hamiltonian depend on the parameters of the interactions explicitly and implicitly by the classical ground state in the corresponding sites .",
    "these are calculated in the appendix . in the case of a collinear ferromagnetic ground state ,",
    "the anomalous terms that do not conserve the boson number vanish : @xmath24 . in general , in a non - collinear ground state , the anomalous terms are different from zero and the magnon number is no longer a conserved quantity . in these cases",
    "a bogoliubov approach is needed in order to diagonalize the hamiltonian .",
    "we undertake such task following the algorithm described in ref . .",
    "by so doing , we can write the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian2 ] ) in the form : @xmath25\\bar{\\mathbf{h}}\\left[\\!\\begin{array}{cc}\\chi \\\\ \\widetilde{\\chi}^{\\dagger}\\end{array}\\!\\right]-\\frac{1}{2}tr[\\bar{\\mathbf{h } } ] \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "the hermitian matrix @xmath27 is a @xmath28 bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian that must be diagonalized in terms of paraunitary transformation matrix@xcite @xmath29 .",

    "importantly , this quantity is non - zero even in the ground state , @xmath40 , reflecting the zero - point quantum fluctuations that are a consequence of a noncollinear classical ground state and lead to a reduction of the magnetization along the classical direction ( see eq .",
    "[ hptransf ] ) .",
    "we now apply the formalism of the previous section to compute the spin waves of finite size chains with spin spiral ground states . this method has been applied to infinite crystals , providing the spin wave dispersion @xmath41 associated to spin spirals.@xcite      we address first the case of a simple chain with first nearest neighbors exchange and dm interactions . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", we shall see that this simple model captures the essence of the physical behavior of the spin waves in the more realistic case described in the next subsection .",
    "the first step is to calculate the classical ground state . for a given choice of hamiltonian parameters ,",
    "the ground state is found either by a self - consistent minimization procedure or by classical monte carlo .",
    "the ground state of the mono strand chain is shown fig . 1a and also in fig .",
    "2 , for uniaxial anisotropy @xmath11 mev , @xmath9 , and @xmath42 mev .",
    "it is apparent that , because of the single ion anisotropy term , the spin spiral is distorted .",

    "the period of the spiral is approximately 7 atoms , slightly shorter than the result obtained from the case without anisotropy ( @xmath45 ) .     over the @xmath6 ( dashed blue ) and the @xmath4 ( solid red ) directions for the monostrand chain with first nearest neighbor interactions .",

    ", we show the evolution of the five lowest energy modes as a function of the applied field @xmath48 , applied along the easy axis ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the abrupt change in the spectrum at fields near @xmath49 t corresponds to a drastic modification of the ground state from helical to ferromagnetic order .",
