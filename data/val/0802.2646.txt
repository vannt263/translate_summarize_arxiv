    "the understanding of the hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) interaction is essential to the physics of nuclear systems with strangeness and to the octet of the lightest baryons .",
    "furthermore , since e.g.  the core of neutron stars may contain a high fraction of hyperons a deeper knowledge of the @xmath0 interaction is also important for astrophysical issues . in recent years",
    ", an increased interest in exploring nuclear systems with strangeness , especially multi - strange nuclear systems , becomes apparent .",
    "the @xmath0 interaction becomes relevant not only when the properties of simple hypernuclei , double strange hypernuclei but also when the production of hyperfragments in relativistic heavy - ion collisions are studied .",
    "it also strongly influences the composition and behavior of dense nuclear matter . for an recent overview of hypernuclear physics",
    "see @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the details of the @xmath0 interaction are known very poorly .",
    "on the one hand , there exist only a very limited amount of scattering data from which one could construct high - quality @xmath0 potentials based on meson - exchange .",
    "the existing data do not constrain the potentials sufficiently . on the other hand , theoretical analyses , especially for many - body systems ,",
    "do not seem to produce unambiguous results @xcite .",
    "for example , this uncertainty is immediately demonstrated in that six different parameterizations of the nijmegen @xmath0 potentials fit equally well the scattering data but produce very different scattering lengths , see e.g.  @xcite . in order to improve the reliability of available hyperon - nucleon and even hyperon - hyperon potentials forthcoming experiments at the planned j - parc and fair facilities are indispensable .",
    "recently , first lattice qcd simulations on the @xmath0 interaction have been performed @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the findings on the lattice concerning some aspects of @xmath2 scattering are confronted with results of the chiral effective field theory ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "for the nucleon - nucleon interaction a unique low - momentum effective potential is obtained @xcite .",
    "this uniqueness is lost in the @xmath0 case due to the less constraint bare potentials .",
    "given that there are significant differences between various @xmath0 potentials it will be interesting to see how those differences reflect themselves in the hyperon single - particle potentials .",
    "in this work we therefore wish to compare various @xmath0 potentials and determine their similarities and differences in a dense baryonic medium . for this purpose",
    "we calculate the @xmath0 single - particle potentials and compare different low - energy scattering results .",
    "the potentials are obtained in a hartree - fock approximation with an effective low - momentum @xmath0 potential @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1 is constructed from several bare @xmath0 potentials @xcite . since we work with isospin - symmetric nuclear matter , which contains no hyperons we can neglect the hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath4 ) interaction .",
    "this is advantageous since the @xmath4 interaction is even less known and constrained than the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "it has been recently shown that in the construction of the @xmath4 interaction , at leading order @xmath3 , only one additional operator , which is not present in the @xmath0 interaction , appears .",
    "the strength of this operator can be roughly estimated from existing data on double hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section we first introduce the definition and formalism of the effective low - momentum potential @xmath1 for the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "the @xmath1 is obtained as a solution of an renormalization group equation , which needs bare @xmath0 potentials as initial condition .",
    "we introduce and discuss in the following some properties of the bare @xmath0 potentials , used in this work and present some low - energy scattering quantities .",
    "the following section , , is devoted to the calculation of the single - particle potentials in the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "results for symmetric nuclear matter , the partial - wave contribution to the single - particle potentials and a comparison to other approaches are shown .",
    "finally , we end in with a summary and conclusion .",
    "we consider hyperons ( @xmath5 ) with strangeness @xmath6 in an infinite system of nucleons @xmath7 composed of equal numbers of protons @xmath8 and neutrons @xmath9 .",
    "we consider densities around nuclear saturation density @xmath10 @xmath11 corresponding to a fermi momentum @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction is switched off .",
    "there exists only a very limited amount of scattering data with which one can construct phenomenological potentials .",
    "these potentials are used as initial condition for solving rg equations , which lead to effective low - momentum @xmath0 interactions @xmath1 s . from these different effective @xmath1 s",
    "we finally calculate the single - particle potential for the @xmath14-hyperon .",
    "we start with a brief review of the construction of the low - momentum @xmath0 interaction .",
    "details for several bare @xmath0 potentials within the rg framework used here can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the starting point for the construction of the @xmath1 is the half - on - shell @xmath16-matrix , @xmath17 , which is determined by the nonrelativistic lippmann - schwinger equation in momentum space .",
    "the on - shell energy is denoted by @xmath18 while @xmath19 , @xmath20 are relative momenta between a hyperon and nucleon .",
    "an effective low - momentum @xmath21-matrix is then obtained by introducing a cutoff @xmath14 in the lippmann - schwinger kernel thus integrating the intermediate - state momenta up to this cutoff . at the same time , the bare potential in the coupled - channel partial - wave lippmann - schwinger equation are replaced with the corresponding low - momentum potential @xmath1 , @xmath22 the labels @xmath23 , @xmath24 indicate the particle channels , e.g.  @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 denote the partial waves , e.g.  @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the angular , @xmath30 the total momentum and @xmath31 the spin . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vlowk ] ) the energies are given by @xmath32 with the reduced mass @xmath33 and total mass @xmath34 of the hyperon @xmath35 and the nucleon @xmath36 .",
    "finally , the effective low - momentum @xmath1 is defined by the requirement that the @xmath16-matrices are equivalent for all momenta below this cutoff @xmath37 the @xmath1 thus obtained is non - hermitian but nevertheless phase - shift equivalent hermitian low - momentum @xmath0 interactions can be obtained . since the low - momentum @xmath16-matrix , @xmath21 must be cutoff - independent , i.e. @xmath38 an rg flow equation for @xmath1 @xmath39 can immediately be derived . instead of solving this flow equation with standard numerical methods ( e.g.  runge - kutta method ) directly , the so - called als iteration method , pioneered by andreozzi , lee and suzuki ,",
    "is used  @xcite .",
    "this iteration method is based on a similarity transformation and its solution corresponds to solving the flow equation .",
    "details about the convergence of the als iteration method , applied for the coupled channel @xmath0 interaction , can be found in @xcite .",
    "for the hyperon - nucleon interaction with strangeness @xmath6 two different basis systems , the isospin and the particle basis of the bare potentials are available . we will use the latter .",
    "furthermore , in our investigations only the diagonal elements of the matrices are needed .",
    "therefore , we will shorten our notation further and introduce the abbreviation @xmath40 for all diagonal quantities .      in order to solve the flow equation ( [ eq : vlowk_flow ] ) a bare potential as initial condition for the flow has to be chosen . in this work several initial @xmath0 potentials , the original nijmegen soft core model nsc89 @xcite , the series of models nsc97a - f @xcite also by the nijmegen group and a recent model proposed by the jlich group @xcite , labeled as j04 in the following , are used .",
    "all these models are formulated in the conventional meson - exchange ( obe ) framework .",
    "they involve a set of parameters , which have to be determined from the available scattering data .",
    "these are the coupling constants of the corresponding baryon - baryon - meson vertices and cutoff parameters for the vertex form factors .",
    "due to the scarce @xmath0 scattering data base these parameters can not be precisely fixed in contrast to the @xmath41 interaction , where a lot of scattering data are available . in order to construct consistently conventional obe models for the @xmath0 interaction one",
    "usually assumes flavor @xmath42 constraints or @xmath43-parity arguments on the coupling constants , and in some cases even the @xmath44 symmetry of the quark model and adjusts their size by fits to @xmath41 data .",
    "the major conceptual difference between the various conventional obe models consists in the treatment of the scalar - meson sector , which plays an important role in any baryon - baryon interaction at intermediate ranges .",
    "in contrast to the pseudoscalar and vector meson sectors it is still an open issue who are the actual members of the lowest - lying scalar - meson @xmath42 multiplet , what are the masses of the exchange particles and how , if at all , the relations for the coupling constants , obtained by @xmath42 flavor symmetry , should be applied .",
    "for example , in the older versions of the @xmath0 models by the jlich group @xcite a fictitious @xmath45 meson with a mass of roughly 550 mev , arising from correlated @xmath46 exchange was introduced .",
    "the coupling strength of this meson to the baryons was treated as a free parameter and finally fitted to the data . however , in the novel jlich @xmath0 potential @xcite a microscopic model of the correlated @xmath46 and @xmath47 exchange is established in order to fix the contributions in the scalar @xmath45- and vector @xmath48-channel .",
    "this new model incorporates also the common one - boson exchange parts of the lowest pseudoscalar and vector meson multiplets .",
    "the corresponding coupling constants are determined by @xmath42 flavor symmetry and the so - called @xmath49 ratios are fixed by the pseudoscalar and vector meson multiplets by invoking @xmath44 symmetry .",
    "in the nijmegen @xmath0 models , nsc89 @xcite , nsc97 @xcite and in the recently extended soft - core model for strangeness @xmath50 esc04 @xcite the interaction is generated by a genuine scalar @xmath42 nonet meson exchange . besides the scalar - meson nonet two additional nonets ,",
    "the pseudoscalar and vector @xmath42 flavor nonets are considered in all nijmegen models .",
    "in addition , pomeron exchange is also included , which provides additional short - range repulsion . nevertheless , there are a few conceptual differences in the various nijmegen models . in the nsc97 models the strength parameter for the spin - spin interaction the magnetic @xmath49 ratio",
    "is left as an open parameter and takes six different values in between a range of @xmath51 to @xmath52 for the six different models nsc97a - f . in the original nijmegen sc89 model",
    "this parameter is constrained by weak - decay data .",
    "furthermore , the nsc97 models include additional @xmath42 flavor breaking , which is based on the so - called @xmath53p@xmath54 model @xcite .",
    "the predictions of the above mentioned models can be compared with an another approach , the so - called chiral effective field theory ( @xmath3 ) to nuclear interactions , which is based on chiral perturbation theory ( for recent reviews see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the major benefit of the @xmath3is the underlying power counting scheme , proposed by weinberg @xcite , that allows to improve the calculations systematically by going to higher orders in the expansion .",
    "in addition , higher two- and three - body forces can be derived consistently in this framework .",
    "furthermore , the effective potential is explicitly energy independent in contrast to the original weinberg scheme",
    ".    within @xmath3the @xmath41 interaction has been analyzed recently to a high precision ( n@xmath53lo ) @xcite . to leading order ( lo ) the @xmath41 potential",
    "is composed of pion exchanges and a series of contact interactions with an increasing number of derivatives which parameterize the singular short - range part of the @xmath41 force .",
    "in order to remove the high - energy components of the baryonic and pseudoscalar meson fields a cutoff @xmath14 dependent regulator function in the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation is introduced . with this regularized ls equation observable quantities can be calculated .",
    "the cutoff range is limited from below by the mass of the pseudoscalar exchange mesons .",
    "note , that in conventional meson - exchange models the ls equation is not regularized and convergence is achieved by introducing form factors with corresponding cutoff masses for each meson - baryon - baryon vertices .",
    "so far , the @xmath0 interaction has not been investigated in the context of the @xmath3as extensively as the @xmath41 interaction . a recent application to the @xmath0 interaction by the jlich group",
    "can be found e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "analogous to the @xmath41 case , the @xmath0 potential , obtained in lo @xmath3 , and consists of four - baryon contact terms and pseudoscalar meson ( goldstone boson ) exchanges , which are all related by @xmath55 symmetry .",
    "for the @xmath0 interaction typical values for the cutoff lie in the range between 550 and 700 mev ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . at lo @xmath3and for a fixed cutoff @xmath14 and pseudoscalar @xmath49 ratio",
    "there are five free parameters .",
    "the remaining interaction in the other @xmath0 channels are then determined by @xmath55 symmetry .",
    "a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xmath3analysis of the @xmath0 scattering and of the hyperon mass shifts in nuclear matter was performed in @xcite .",
    "however , in this analysis the pseudoscalar meson - exchange contributions were not taken into account explicitly but the @xmath0 scattering data could be described successfully for laboratory momenta below 200 mev using 12 free parameters .",
    "one ambiguity in this approach is the value of the @xmath56 coupling which is identified with the octet @xmath57 meson coupling and not with the physical @xmath56 meson .",
    "the influence of this ambiguity on the data description can be disregarded @xcite .    since there are scarce @xmath0 scattering data available , it has not been possible yet to determine uniquely the spin structure of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "nevertheless , all of the above mentioned obe models are consistent with the measured @xmath0 scattering observables .",
    "in addition , all of these potentials include the @xmath58 conversion process .      in order to obtain further insight into the separation of scales for the evolution of the low - momentum @xmath1",
    "we investigate its cutoff dependence .",
    "a common feature of all @xmath0 potentials is the long - range one - pion exchange ( ope ) tail . in general",
    ", the rg decimation eliminates the short - distance part of the bare potential and preserves the model - independent impact of the high - momentum components on low - momentum observables . in this sense , the ambiguities associated with the unresolved short - distance parts of the interaction disappear and a universal low - momentum @xmath0 interaction @xmath1 can be constructed from phase shift equivalent bare @xmath0 potentials .",
    "the mentioned hierarchy of scales can be seen e.g.  in the @xmath59 channel , see .",
    "the @xmath1 matrix elements for vanishing momenta are shown as a function of the cutoff @xmath14 for the @xmath60 partial wave .",
    "when @xmath14 is decreased , the resulting @xmath1 becomes more and more attractive . for @xmath60 and",
    "a cutoff @xmath61 mev @xmath1 becomes cutoff independent .",
    "decreasing the cutoff further below the @xmath62 exchange threshold , which corresponds to a @xmath63 mev , the cutoff insensitivity disappears since the pion contributions are finally integrated out .    in the opposite direction , i.e.  for @xmath64",
    "no fluctuations have been integrated and @xmath1 tends to the bare potential .",
    "the limit @xmath65 of @xmath1 should yield the scattering length . in the limit of small cutoffs an analytic solution obtained in the framework of the effective theory , see @xcite , is given by the expression @xmath66^{-1 }    \\qquad \\mbox{for } \\qquad \\lambda \\rightarrow 0\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have simplified our notation in an obvious manner . here",
    ", the scattering length @xmath67 is needed as input , which we have calculated in the standard effective range approximation directly from the @xmath16-matrix for the @xmath60 channel from the @xmath1 . in this approximation",
    "the @xmath16-matrix for @xmath68 can be expanded as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the effective range .",
    "the results for all different @xmath0 flavor channels and for all bare obe potentials and the @xmath3potential used in this work with cutoffs between @xmath71 and @xmath72 mev are listed in for the scattering length @xmath67 in units of fm    .scattering lengths @xmath67 of @xmath1 for different flavor channels in units of @xmath73 for the @xmath60 partial wave .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in these tables the partial waves up to @xmath74 are shown and the last column contains the sum up to @xmath75 . as expected , the influence of the @xmath31- and @xmath76-waves is the most dominant one .",
    "one can see that the combination of the coupled @xmath77 and @xmath78 channels provides most of the attraction in the majority of the @xmath14 potentials .",
    "these tables also illustrate the different contributions to the hyperon potentials originating from the central , spin - spin , spin - orbit parts of the @xmath0 interaction . these partial waves can than be use to determine the size of these contributions , which could than be compared to other results such as @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one can recognize that a change in the @xmath49 ratio from the different bare nsc97a - f potentials affects @xmath79 stronger than the @xmath80 .",
    "another interesting feature is that the @xmath3successfully reproduces the potential depth at saturation density . for these densities , the @xmath3agrees well with the nijmegen nsc97a - f potentials .",
    "shows a comparison of the @xmath81 density dependence , obtained with the @xmath3 , with results from @xcite .",
    "perfect agreement for the @xmath81 is evident and the independence of the @xmath3potential on the regulator cutoff is also seen .",
    "this suggests that the two approaches in refs . @xcite and @xcite to construct an @xmath3 ,",
    "are closely related .",
    "furthermore , @xmath3 in leading order can already produce a reasonable @xmath2 potential .",
    "shows the density dependence for several @xmath82 potentials at rest in symmetric nuclear matter similar to the previous figure .",
    "the other members of the @xmath83 triplet , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , exhibit an almost identical behavior .",
    "a small differences compared to the @xmath82 case is found to be due to a small difference in their masses .",
    "therefore , in the remaining section we discuss only the @xmath82 potential . for @xmath86",
    "no density range is found where all or even most potentials agree . however , the difference between the nsc97a - f potentials is not significant and is the same over the entire range of densities shown .",
    "this further confirms that the influence of the @xmath49 ratio on the @xmath87 interaction is less important than on @xmath2 .",
    "due to experimental uncertainties in case of the @xmath83 potential , no generally accepted empirical point can be used as a reference . on the one hand ,",
    "recent results @xcite , based on the distorted - wave impulse approximation , yield a repulsive potential of the order of @xmath88 . on the other hand , the analysis of the same data by @xcite in a semiclassical distorted - wave model and an analysis by @xcite within a distorted - wave impulse approximation with a local optimal fermi averaged @xmath16-matrix find a less repulsive potential .",
    "in addition , there exists a bound state of @xmath89 @xcite , which definitely requires an attractive potential .",
    "thus , for this case no conclusive answer on the theoretical as well as experimental side can be given .",
    "compared with a @xmath43-matrix calculation a stronger binding for the @xmath83 single particle potential is found . in particular , using the nsc89 interaction a binding of @xmath90 @xcite is found while for the nsc97a potential @xmath91 and for the nsc97f potential @xmath92 are reported @xcite . in order to understand the origin of such a significant difference the individual partial - wave contributions to the potential by @xcite",
    "are compared with each other .",
    "the @xmath60 channel contributions are approximately the same while those for the @xmath77 channel are significantly different .",
    "this difference in the @xmath77 channel is present for both @xmath14 and @xmath82 potentials and is the results of the difference in the treatment of the @xmath77 @xmath58 channel .",
    "since the effective interactions are constructed from @xmath1 and the @xmath43-matrix formalisms , respectively , the difference comes from the treatment of the attractive part of the bare potentials above the cutoff .",
    "this is similar to the point made in where a cutoff dependence is visible : by lowering the cutoff more and more attraction is effectively added to the interaction .",
    "it is also interesting to note , that the effective potentials constructed in the @xmath43-matrix calculations , nsc89 and nsc97a , f depend on the underlying bare potentials in a similar way as the potentials shown here .",
    "this is another sign that the uncertainties are inherent in the underlying potentials .    in the momentum dependence of the @xmath86 at saturation density for various @xmath0 potentials",
    "is displayed and illustrates how strongly the results depend on the parameterization of the @xmath0 interaction and reiterates that the @xmath87 interaction is very poorly constrained .    shows the density dependence of the real part @xmath93 and the imaginary @xmath94 of an optical potential calculation of ref .  @xcite together with the results obtained from @xmath3 .",
    "the most interesting feature here is that all potentials are positive and grow with increasing density in contrast to other potentials .",
    "however , unlike in the case of the @xmath14 potential , @xmath86 depends on the regulator cutoff and only @xmath3with a cutoff of 600 mev agrees with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite quantitatively . as already mentioned earlier ,",
    "the repulsive @xmath82 potential , which grows with density , has been suggested by saha et al .",
    "@xcite by means of an analysis of ( @xmath95 ) inclusive spectra .",
    "recently , a calculation of the binding energy of the @xmath14 hyperon in nuclear matter within a dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock framework was performed using the most recent jlich meson exchange @xmath0 potential @xcite .",
    "the reported values of the @xmath14 potential of @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) in brueckner - hartree - fock ( dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ) framework agree well with our prediction of @xmath98 .",
    "in this paper an application of recently constructed @xmath0 @xmath15potentials @xcite is presented .",
    "the potentials were constructed in a rg formalism and applied to nuclear matter .",
    "the calculation of the single - particle potential of the @xmath14 and @xmath83 hyperon was performed in the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "since the @xmath15  is an low - momentum interaction , it can be directly used in the considered range of momenta .    for comparison with other approaches , scattering lengths and the single - particle potential of several bare potentials were calculated .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath41 case , it is not possible to obtain a precise fit of the @xmath0 potential to all partial waves , due to the incomplete @xmath0 scattering data base .",
    "this deficiency is clearly visible in the results obtained .",
    "a few interesting observations are in order , however .",
    "the @xmath15for the @xmath99 @xmath60 channel is cutoff independent in between momenta of @xmath100 and @xmath101 mev , but no such independence was found in the @xmath77 channel due to a strongly attractive short - range part .",
    "the results for the @xmath14 potential are more satisfying since most of the potentials agree up to saturation density and reproduce the empirical point .",
    "an interesting observation is that @xmath3 in leading order lies among these potentials .",
    "however , for the @xmath82 potential no such agreement exists .",
    "unfortunately , the present experimental situation for @xmath82 does not allow for more stringent conclusions .",
    "finally , the results are also compared with other approaches , @xcite .",
    "most of the results of a @xmath43-matrix calculations yield a stronger binding than we find .",
    "the difference comes from the way in which the attraction , especially in the @xmath102 channels , is treated in the rg approach . in comparison with @xmath3overall agreement",
    "is seen @xcite .    however ,",
    "the most interesting fact is that differences in approaches , @xmath15 , g - matrix and @xmath3 , are much less than the differences between the various potentials .",
    "thus the differences we see here are not the result of the approaches used to construct the effective interaction , but largely reflect uncertainties in the underlying bare potentials .",
