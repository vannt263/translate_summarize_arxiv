    "s. mukhopadhyaya @xcite published the following celebrated theorems : _ every closed smooth convex plane curve has at least 4 distinct vertices and at least 6 distinct affine vertices_. these results generated a very substantial literature ; from the modern point of view they are related , among other subjects , to global singularity theory of wave fronts and sturm theory ",
    "see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "a recent and unexpected result along these lines is the following theorem by e.  ghys @xcite : _ the schwarzian derivative of every projective line diffeomorphism has at least 4 distinct zeroes _ ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the schwarzian derivative vanishes when the 3-rd jet of the diffeomorphism coincides with that of a projective transformation ( at a generic point a diffeomorphism can be approximated by a projective transformation up to the 2-nd derivative ) .",
    "ghys theorem can be interpreted as the 4 vertex theorem in lorentzian geometry ( cf .",
    "references above ) .",
    "the goal of this note is to study polygonal analogs of the above three results . in our opinion , such a discretization of smooth formulations is interesting for the following reasons .",
    "first , a discrete theorem is a - priori stronger ; it becomes , in the limit , a smooth one , thus providing a new proof of the latter .",
    "an important feature of the discrete approach is the availability of mathematical induction which can considerably simplify the proofs .",
    "second , the very operation of discretization is non - trivial : a single smooth theorem may lead to non - equivalent discrete ones .",
    "an example of this phenomenon is provided by two recent versions of the 4 vertex theorem for convex plane polygons @xcite  see remark [ fourrmk ] below . to the best of our knowledge , these results are the only available discrete versions of the 4 vertex theorem .    in this",
    "regard we would like to attract attention to the celebrated cauchy lemma  ( 1813 ) : _ given two convex plane ( or spherical ) polygons whose respective sides are congruent , the cyclic sequence of the differences of the respective angles of the polygons changes sign at least 4 times_. this result plays a crucial role in the proof of convex polyhedra rigidity ( see @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "the cauchy lemma implies , in the limit , the smooth 4 vertex theorem and can be considered as the first result in the area under discussion .",

    "moreover , a generic curve crosses the osculating circle at a generic point and stays on one side of the osculating circle at a vertex .",

    "m.  barner introduced the notion of a _ strictly convex _ curve in real projective space : this is a smooth closed curve @xmath47 such that for every @xmath48-tuple of points of @xmath49 there exists a hyperplane through these points that does not intersect @xmath49 at other points .",
