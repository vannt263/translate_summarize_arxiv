    "although we removed all x - ray detections from our sample , dust - obscured agns that show strong 24 flux can not be identified . furthermore , systematic uncertainties in the conversion from mips fluxes to total ir luminosities are of the order of a factor 3 at @xmath5 ( labb et al . in preparation ) .",
    "in addition , we can not be sure that the local ir templates on which we base our conversion still hold in the @xmath59 universe .",

    "( 2007 ) argue that at @xmath5 , local templates overpredict the total ir luminosity by a factor of a few .",
    "however , their local templates include a luminosity dependent conversion .",
    "in contrast , we apply a single template ( without luminosity dependence ) , which results in smaller systematic offsets .",
    "in addition , we found good agreement between the average sfrs based on mips flux and sed modeling for the low- to intermediate - mass galaxies .",

    "2008 ) , similar to what we find .",
    "concluding , it is unlikely that the full discrepancy is caused by the systematic uncertainties in deriving sfrs .",
    "+ a third reason why our sfrs are large , could be the assumption of a non - evolving imf .",
    "recently , there have been several authors who suggest that the imf is not constant , but instead evolves with redshift .",
    "van dokkum ( 2008 ; vd08 ) found that reconciling the evolution of color and mass - light - ratio of massive , early - type cluster galaxies favors a top - heavy imf .",
    "dav ( 2008 ; d08 ) argues that an evolving imf brings the observed evolution in the relationship between sfr and stellar mass in better agreement with model predictions .",
    "finally , wilkins et al .",
    "( 2008 ; w08 ) claim that the assumption of a simple model for an evolving imf significantly reduces the discrepancy between the integrated sfh and stellar mass density measurements .",
    "+ we used the effect an evolving imf would have on sfrs ( figure3 from w08 , figure3 from d08 ) and ssfrs ( figure12a and figure14b from vd08 ) to redetermine our growth rates and show the results in figure[imf_corr ] .",
    "it is important to note that for the w08 and d08 growth rates ( shown in blue ) , we only included the effect an evolving imf has on sfr , and not on mass .",
    "for this reason the blue curves should be regarded as lower limits .",
    "the overall factor with which the growth rate decreases when an evolving imf is applied is @xmath81.3 for van dokkum ( 2008 ) , @xmath621.8 for wilkins et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and @xmath62 2.4 for dav ( 2008 ) .",
    "although this helps reducing the discrepancy between the instantaneous sfr and sfr based on the mass function ( w08 ) , the steep increase between z = 0 and z = 1 is still intact .",
    "+ finally , the use of photometric redshifts introduces some uncertainty to the sfr estimates .",
    "we note , however , that the growth rates of simple ( green line in figure  [ guo ] ) are based on the photometric redshifts of combo-17 , which are highly accurate out to @xmath63 .",
    "since the simple results show the same strong slope as the fireworks growth rates , we do not expect photometric redshift errors to be a significant cause for the discrepancy between the model and observations .",
    "+ none of the effects we discussed above can provide a clear - cut solution to explain the difference between the model and observations , particularly the observed steep rise in growth rate between z=0 and z=1 .",
    "the discrepancy could be caused by a flaw in the models , e.g. concerning for instance the gas supply to the galaxy .",
    "the current way stars are formed in sams is by heating gas to the virial temperature after which it gradually cools to the temperature where star formation can commence .",
    "dekel et al .",
    "( 2009 ) show that this process is too slow to explain the fact that massive galaxies have already formed most of their stars at high redshift .",
    "they introduce a new way of star formation , where cold gas enters the dark matter halo through filaments and can start forming stars immediately .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate how this implementation of star formation would alter model predictions and whether it would be able to reproduce the steep rise of the growth rate at low redshifts .",
    "+ despite the differences we identified between our observations and the model values of guo & white ( 2008 ) , we also found an interesting agreement .",
    "it is remarkable that both observations and models find that the increase in ssfr is the same for low- and high - mass galaxies .",

    "<S> we investigate the star formation history of the universe using fireworks , a multiwavelength survey of the cdfs . </S>",
    "<S> we study the evolution of the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) with redshift in different mass bins from z = 0 to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ssfr increases with redshift for all masses . </S>",
    "<S> the logarithmic increase of the ssfr with redshift is nearly independent of mass , but this can not yet be verified at the lowest - mass bins at @xmath1 , due to incompleteness . </S>",
    "<S> we convert the ssfrs to a dimensionless growth rate to facilitate a comparison with a semi - analytic galaxy formation model that was implemented on the millennium simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the model predicts that the growth rates and ssfrs increase similarly with redshift for all masses , consistent with the observations . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that for all masses , the inferred observed growth rates increase more rapidly with redshift than the model predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss several possible causes for this discrepancy , ranging from field - to - field variance , conversions to sfr , and shape of the imf . </S>",
    "<S> we find that none of these can solve the discrepancy completely . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the models need to be adapted to produce the steep increase in growth rate between redshift @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>"
