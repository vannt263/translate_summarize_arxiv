    "<S> this paper studies @xmath0-person simultaneous - move games with linear best response function , where individuals interact within a given network structure . </S>",
    "<S> this class of games have been used to model various settings , such as , public goods , belief formation , peer effects , and oligopoly . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to study the effect of the network structure on nash equilibrium outcomes of this class of games . </S>",
    "<S> bramoull et al . </S>",
    "<S> derived conditions for uniqueness and stability of a nash equilibrium in terms of the smallest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix representing the network of interactions . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this result , we study how local structural properties of the network of interactions affect this eigenvalue , influencing game equilibria . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we use algebraic graph theory and convex optimization to derive new bounds on the smallest eigenvalue in terms of the distribution of degrees , cycles , and other relevant substructures . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate our results with numerical simulations involving online social networks . </S>"
