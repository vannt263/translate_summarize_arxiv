    "* visser & dullemond 2010 ) ) . by taking the vertical extent of the disk into account , we find that accretion from the envelope onto the disk largely takes place near the cold outer edge , rather than near the warmer inner parts as suggested by earlier models .",
    "the lower temperatures in our scenario allow for a larger fraction of pristine material to enter the disk .",
    "the 2d models also show strong evidence of layered accretion in the disk : new material arriving from the envelope always accretes on top of the older material already in the disk ( fig .",

    "in order to follow the chemical evolution from a pre - stellar core to a circumstellar disk , we need a physical framework to provide densities , temperatures and other quantities that may affect the chemistry .",

    "different streamlines exhibit different physical conditions . in order to fully understand the chemical evolution from every point in the pre - stellar core to every point in the circumstellar disk",
    ", we have to investigate more than just the single trajectory from fig .",
    "[ fig : trajchem ] . in this regard ,",
    "it is interesting to look at where material from different parts of the core ends up in the disk .    the hydrodynamical simulations of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* brinch et al . ( 2008 ) ) and our semi - analytical model ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* visser et al . 2009a ) ) both show the envelope to accrete onto the disk in a layered fashion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : acclayers ] ) .",
    "material from near the centre of the pre - stellar core is the first to become part of the disk , and material from larger radii continuously piles up on top .",
    "the thickness of the disk is small relative to its radial size ( typical scale heights are 0.10.2@xmath31 ) , but the outer edge is high enough that a substantial fraction of the infalling material hits there rather than on the surface ( fig .  [",
    "fig : acclayers ] ; see also fig .  3 in (",
    "* visser & dullemond 2010 ) ) .",
    "the infalling material has to compete with the outwardly expanding disk , resulting in some material being pushed up and over the outer edge in the hydrodynamical simulations ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van weeren et al .",
    "2009 ) ) .",
    "individual streamlines can exhibit large qualitative differences despite terminating at nearly the same point in the disk .",
    "figure [ fig : traj ] shows two such streamlines , with termini at 2.9 and 3.7 au from the star .",
    "the streamline in the bottom panel originates at @xmath32 au from the centre of the pre - stellar core .",
    "it reaches the disk at a fairly early time ( @xmath33 yr after the onset of collapse ) , when the disk is only a few au large .",
    "the parcel of gas following this streamline gets swept up in the outward viscous expansion until , at @xmath34 yr , enough mass has accreted at larger radii that it gets pushed back in again .",
    "the streamline in the bottom panel originates further out in the natal core , at @xmath35 au , and therefore accretes at a later time , @xmath36 yr , when the disk has grown to about 20 au .",
    "it experiences a brief period of outward motion before moving in further .    in terms of the chemical evolution of the material flowing along these two streamlines ,",
    "the key difference lies in the conditions encountered before @xmath37 yr .",
    "the bottom streamline passes much closer to the star than does the other one ( 1.6 versus 16 au ) ; it is heated to more than 500 k , whereas the top parcel initially does not get warmer than 120 k. the latter is enough to drive h@xmath1o and other non - refractory species off the grains ( as indicated by the grey portion of the streamline up to @xmath38 yr ) , but not enough to power the kind of high - temperature gas - phase chemistry that is possible at 500 k.    the different types of streamlines give rise to different chemical zones in the disk .",
    "this effect of `` chemical stratification '' is visualised in fig .",
    "[ fig : wzones ] , which traces the history of h@xmath1o gas and ice towards various parts of the disk .",
    "( similar figures for ch@xmath12 and nh@xmath13 appear in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* visser et al . ( 2011 ) ) . )",
    "the streamlines terminating in zone 1 never encounter temperatures above 100 k , so h@xmath1o always remains frozen on the grains .",
    "zone 2 contains the terminus of the streamline from fig .",
    "[ fig : trajchem ] ; some h@xmath1o ends up here , but most of it is dissociated by the stellar radiation field .",
    "the same happens for material ending up in zone 3 , except that no h@xmath1o reforms at all after being destroyed .",
    "parcels ending up in zone 4 do not encounter a strong radiation field ; h@xmath1o in these parcels stays on the grains until passing the snowline at @xmath395 au .",
    "finally , zones 5 and 6 consist largely of material that accreted at early times , following trajectories like the one in the bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : traj ] .",
    "h@xmath1o in these parcels undergoes a freeze - thaw cycle : it evaporates during the initial inwards part of the trajectory and freezes out again during the outwards leg .",
    "parcels ending up in zone 5 undergo another evaporation event as they pass the snowline ; material in zone 6 lies beyond the snowline , so h@xmath1o remains frozen the rest of the time .",
    "the chemical stratification comes with one major caveat : mixing . in our model",
    ", there is no exchange of material between adjacent parcels . in reality , however , turbulent mixing is likely to change the sizes and locations of the chemical zones , and to make the borders between the zones more diffuse ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* semenov et al . 2006 ) ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations at 510 au resolution , as possible with alma , are required to determine to what extent chemical stratification occurs in actual disks .",
    "when the supersonically infalling material from the envelope hits the nearly static disk , it passes through a j - type shock .",
    "however , this shock may not play as large a role as commonly believed .",
    "* neufeld & hollenbach ( 1994 ) ) showed that the strength of the shock decreases with decreasing pre - shock density and decreasing shock velocity .",
    "for a given radius , the density and velocity decrease as the collapse proceeds ; for a given point in time , both decrease with radius ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cassen & moosman 1981 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* terebey et al . 1984 ) ) .    during the second half of the collapse phase ( from @xmath40 to @xmath41 ) , at least 80% of the infalling material accretes onto the outer half of the disk . ( the exact number depends on the initial conditions . ) at the end of the collapse phase , the bulk of the disk consists of material that accreted at fairly late stages and large radii .",
    "most of the material that accreted at early times or small radii gets pushed into the star .",
    "hence , we expect that the bulk of the gas and the dust in a t tauri or herbig ae / be disk did not pass through a strong accretion shock .",
    "quantitatively , we showed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* visser et al . ( 2009a ) ) that the shock has a smaller effect on the temperature history of the disk material than does the radiation from the young star . in terms of the chemical evolution",
    ", this means the desorption of h@xmath1o and organic species is likely unaffected by the accretion shock .",
    "species with lower binding energies , however , may be more sensitive .      observations of complex organic species like methyl formate ( hcooch@xmath13 ) and dimethyl ether ( ch@xmath13och@xmath13 ) in low - mass protostars have been linked to the high - temperature ( @xmath42 k ) inner envelope , also known as the hot core or hot corino ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ceccarelli 2004 ) ) .",
    "one possible formation pathway is powered by the evaporation of h@xmath1o and other non - refractory species at 100 k , followed by a chain of high - temperature gas - phase reactions to transform simple carbon - bearing molecules into second - generation complex organics ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "* charnley et al . 1992 ) ) . in our model",

    "such temperatures are attainable both in the envelope before the material reaches the hot inner part and inside the disk ( e.g. , fig .  12 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* visser et al . 2009a ) ) .",
    "once formed on the grains , these first - generation organics can be returned to the gas phase by thermal evaporation in the hot corino , the hot inner disk , or the surface layers of the outer disk .",
    "they can also be liberated by non - thermal processes such as photodesorption in the disk and shocks in the outflow walls . in any scenario ,",
    "the mass of the hot corino is quite limited : the amount of material wedged between the disk and the outflow cavity is at most a few per cent of the amount of material inside the disk .",
    "hence , even if the hot corino is rich in organics , there still would not be enough of them to explain the observations .    based on the timescales and the mass ,",
    "we conclude that the observed second - generation complex organics are not associated with the hot core or hot corino .",
    "the circumstellar disk and outflow walls offer a more likely explanation : they have a larger mass reservoir and are dynamically stable enough for the observed organics to form abundantly .",
