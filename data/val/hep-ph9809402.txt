    "there are several models for describing cp violation by scalar dynamics .",

    "this kind of models has been widely studied ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "there are other models in which heavy quarks and scalars are introduced and cp violation is originated in the heavy scalar sector .",
    "the cp violation is transported to the ordinary quark sector through the yukawa interactions among heavy quark , ordinary quark and heavy scalar . at the same time",
    ", an attempt is made to resolve the strong cp problem .",
    "these models may be divided into two classes by the existence of the tree level flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) .",
    "there are two typical models without tree level fcnc . in one class of models only right - handed quarks have yukawa interactions with heavy quarks and scalars  @xcite , while in another class only left - handed quarks have the yukawa interaction  @xcite . in both models",
    "cp is violated in the heavy mass terms softly or spontaneously .",
    "a typical model with the tree level fcnc is the aspon model  @xcite .",
    "this model is widely studied ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this model one vector - like su(2)@xmath4 doublet of quarks",
    "are introduced .",
    "those quarks have same charges as up- and down - types of ordinary quarks .",
    "two heavy su(2)@xmath2u(1)@xmath3 singlet scalars have vevs which break cp spontaneously . another model with tree level fcnc",
    "is given in @xcite , where unlike the models considered here , no additional u(1 ) symmetry occurs .",
    "in this paper we study constraints and predictions of the above two models of soft cp breaking comparing with those for the aspon model .",
    "these considerations are timely because experiments are underway to measure both re@xmath5 and the cp asymmetries in @xmath6 decays",
    ". in fact , there are two experiments each to measure both effects .",
    "the former is being measured by the na-48 experiment at cern , and by the e799/e832 ( ktev ) experiment at fermilab .",
    "the latter is being studied by the babar detector of the pep - ii experiment at slac and by the belle experiment at the kek b - factory .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in section([models ] ) we describe in detail the different models we shall analyze . in section([epsilon ] ) the constraints arising from @xmath1 are derived .",
    "the predictions for @xmath7 are given in section([prime ] ) .",
    "in section([b ] ) the constraint of @xmath8 mixing is discussed .",
    "section([decays ] ) covers the cp asymmetry predictions for neutral @xmath9 decay . in section([theta ] ) the lower limits on @xmath10 are calculated , together with the corresponding lower limits on the neutron electric dipole moment .",
    "finally in section([summary ] ) the different predictions are summarized .",
    "here we shall list four different models for cp violation which exemplify all of the ideas we are considering . at the end of the paper we shall summarize the similarities and differences of the experimental predictions .",
    "thus the hurried reader could read just this section and that summary to sample the main points : the intervening sections provide technical details .",
    "the first model is just the standard model ( sm ) with the km mechanism  @xcite of explicit cp violation .",
    "principally , we are interested in models which also solve strong cp ( as all the other three will ) .",
    "the standard model requires an additional mechanism ( _ e.g. _ the peccei - quinn mechanism  @xcite or massless up quark ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) to accomplish this .",
    "nevertheless , it forms an essential comparison for all the other cases .      the class of models we consider for soft cp violation is constructed by adding two su(2)@xmath4 singlet scalars @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) with hyper - charge @xmath14 and one non - chiral quark @xmath15 to the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "these @xmath15 and @xmath11 carry the opposite charges of an extra u(1)@xmath16 symmetry .",
    "the hypercharge of @xmath15 is determined in such a way that the yukawa interactions among @xmath11 , @xmath15 and the ordinary quark @xmath17 are allowed : @xmath18 .",
    "the yukawa interactions in the models can be written as @xmath19 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a real yukawa coupling .",
    "cp is softly broken by the mass term of @xmath11 .",
    "the models in this category are divided into two types by the chirality of the ordinary quark @xmath17 which couples to @xmath15 and @xmath11 : in the first type ( type r ) , @xmath17 is a right - handed down - type quark , @xmath21  @xcite ; in the second type ( type l ) , @xmath17 is a left - handed su(2)@xmath4 doublet quark , @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "let us explain details of these models for soft cp violation .",
    "the scalar potential for @xmath11 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are real quantities and @xmath26 is a complex quantity .",
    "the interaction between @xmath11 and the ordinary su(2)@xmath4 doublet higgs scalar @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is real .",
    "the mass eigenstate @xmath30 is given by a unitary rotation : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a suitable unitary matrix .",

    "an important combination for cp measurement is @xmath37 .",
    "the fact that the original yukawa coupling @xmath20 is real leads @xmath38      here the complex scalar @xmath11 has a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) which spontaneously breaks cp ( aspon model  @xcite ) ; in the aspon model the u(1)@xmath16 is gauged , and the gauge boson acquires its mass from the vev of @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath17 have same charges ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) , and they have complex mass mixing .",
    "accordingly , there exist tree - level flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) mediated by the aspon gauge boson and @xmath11 .",
    "let us briefly review the relevant part of the aspon model . in the aspon model @xmath17 can be the left - handed doublet quarks , or the right - handed down - type quarks , in the simplest versions . in the present analysis we fix @xmath17 to be the left - handed doublet",
    "quarks for definiteness .",
    "all the couplings in the scalar potentials in eqs .",
    "( [ l chi ] ) and ( [ l chi h ] ) are real , and cp is spontaneously broken by the vev of @xmath11 : @xmath41 as a result the light quarks @xmath17 mix with the non - chiral heavy quark @xmath15 .",
    "the mass matrix , in the weak basis where @xmath42 submatrix for down sector is diagonal , is given by  @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 this mass matrix is diagonalized by a biunitary transformation , @xmath45 .",
    "the approximate form of the transformation matrices are given by  @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47    in the weak basis the aspon gauge boson does not couple to light quarks .",
    "however , due to the mixing with the heavy quark @xmath15 , light quarks in terms of the mass eigenstates couple to the aspon gauge boson .",
    "this induces fcnc s : @xmath48 where @xmath49 with @xmath50 being the aspon gauge boson and @xmath51 the gauge coupling .",
    "in addition to the above fcnc s in the left - handed sector there exist fcnc s in the right - handed sector .",
    "however , the coupling is suppressed by the mass ratio @xmath52 , where @xmath53 . similarly , flavor changing couplings to @xmath11 are suppressed by @xmath52 .",
    "so we will neglect these couplings below .",
    "in the sm , @xmath1 arises from the @xmath54 exchange box diagram , and is proportional to a combination of ckm angles and to @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the km phase , and therefore gives a constraint between these sm parameters .",
