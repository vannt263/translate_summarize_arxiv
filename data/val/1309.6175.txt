    "b supergiants are very important for stellar and galactic evolution , as they enrich their evironments with chemically processed material via their line - driven winds .",
    "they show strong line profile variability .",
    "their lines are wider than expected from their parameters .",
    "the excessive width is due to macroturbulence .",
    "both line profile variability and macroturbulence are indications of stellar pulsations .",
    "however , so far only very few such supergiants were investigated to determine their pulsation periods .",
    "hd 202850 is a late b - type supergiant star .",
    "its stellar parameters ( @xcite ) are given in table  [ param ] .",
    "it has been classified as b9 iab , and is located in the ob association cyg ob 4 at a distance of @xmath21 kpc .",
    "it falls out of any previously calculated instability domains ( @xcite ) . in our previous work",
    ", we described the 1.59 h pulsation period we detected ( see @xcite ) .",

    "in 2012 we took a new set of 294 spectra distributed over 5 nights with the dao 1.2-m telescope .",
    "exposures were five minutes long , with a signal - to - noise ratio between 150 and 250 .",
    "the moment analysis showed variability in all three moments , and the first and the third moment seem to vary in phase .",
    "due to high noise , the fft analysis did not show any pronounced peaks , therefore the period(s ) were estimated by fitting a combination of sine curves ( fig .",
