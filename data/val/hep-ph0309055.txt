    "in recent years the study of the phase transitions has become the subject of intense investigation since it is very important from various aspects , ranging from cosmology to particle physics . according to the big bang model",
    "there is a series of phase transitions , including , of course , the chiral phase one , at the early stage of the universe evolution .",
    "the nature of the electroweak phase transition has called much attention due to the suggestion that the baryon asymmetry may be generated at the electroweak scale if the transition is of first order @xcite .",
    "the restoration of chiral symmetry may lead to several interesting phenomena observed , for instance , in the dilepton mass spectrum @xcite or in the formation of disoriented chiral condensates @xcite .",
    "the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is chirally symmetric for light quark sector and must be spontaneously broken due to the existence of pions , the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons .",
    "the lattice qcd calculations indicate that the restoration of chiral symmetry occurs at temperatures of order 150 mev @xcite , which is expected to be probed in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision experiments planned at rhic and lhc @xcite .",
    "the field theoretical investigation of the symmetry restoration at finite temperatures was first carried out by kirzhnits and linde @xcite and then was systematically developed by weinberg @xcite , dolan and jackiw @xcite as well as many others adopting the effective action as the most appropriate formalism for such studies .",
    "it was proved that the leading contributions at very high temperatures come from infinite series of certain class of multiloop diagrams in perturbation theory , which , in the @xmath0 theory , are the so - called daisy and superdaisy diagrams .",
    "recently the effective action for composite operators , originally introduced by cornwall , jackiw and tomboulis @xcite at zero temperature , has been extended for finite temperatures in @xmath0 theory by amelino - camelia and pi @xcite , who showed that one needs to resume only `` double bubble '' graphs instead of summing infinite set of daisy and superdaisy graphs using the tree level propagators .",
    "this is known as hartree - fock approximation @xcite .",
    "moreover , the cjt formalism at finite temperatures leads to reliable results [ 12 , 13 ] , among other approximate approachs .",
    "many works on chiral symmetry restoration at high temperatures have been accomplished [ 14 - 20 ] within the framework of the linear sigma model , which is considered to be the relevant model @xcite for effective theory in low - energy phenomenology of qcd modelling the hadron dynamics associated to the chiral phase transition .",
    "however , there exists serious difficulty concerning the renormalization of the cjt effective action in the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "the point is that a consistent renormalization can not be performed in the broken phase because all terms in the effective action are expressed not only by renormalized quantities but bare quantities remain in several terms @xcite . in [ 16,19 ]",
    "one tried to regularize divergent integrals by means of several schemes instead of renormalizing the cjt effective action in hartree - fock approximation at finite temperatures .    in this work ,",
    "dealing with the chiral phase transition at finite temperatures , we re - examine the linear sigma model since it is most suited for our purpose of describing the phase transition in a self - consistent approximation .",
    "we do not consider the general @xmath1 linear sigma model at large - n limit because it significantly simplifies the counting of multiloop bubble diagrams , which is the most common source of inaccuracy .",
    "we use the imaginary time formalism of matsubara @xcite and work in euclidean space - time .",
