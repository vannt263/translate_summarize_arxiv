    "models constructed with @xmath0-stable distributions possess several useful properties , including infinite variance , skewness and heavy tails (; ; ; ) .",
    "@xmath0-stable distributions provide no general analytic expressions for the density , median , mode or entropy , but are uniquely specified by their characteristic function , which has several parameterizations . considered as generalizations of the gaussian distribution ,",
    "they are defined as the class of location - scale distributions which are closed under convolutions .",
    "@xmath0-stable distributions have found application in many areas of statistics , finance and signal processing engineering as models for impulsive , heavy tailed noise processes (; ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "the univariate @xmath0-stable distribution is typically specified by four parameters : @xmath1 $ ] determining the rate of tail decay ; @xmath2 $ ] determining the degree and sign of asymmetry ( skewness ) ; @xmath3 the scale ( under some parameterizations ) ; and @xmath4 the location . the parameter @xmath0 is termed the characteristic exponent , with small and large @xmath0 implying heavy and light tails respectively .",
    "gaussian ( @xmath5 ) and cauchy ( @xmath6 ) distributions provide the only analytically tractable sub - members of this family . in general , as @xmath0-stable models admit no closed form expression for the density which can be evaluated pointwise ( excepting gaussian and cauchy members ) , inference typically proceeds via the characteristic function .",
    "this paper is concerned with constructing both univariate and multivariate bayesian models in which the likelihood model is from the class of @xmath0-stable distributions .",
    "this is known to be a difficult problem .",
    "existing methods for bayesian @xmath0-stable models are limited to the univariate setting (; ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "inferential procedures for @xmath0-stable models may be classified as auxiliary variable methods , inversion plus series expansion approaches and density estimation methods .",
    "the auxiliary variable gibbs sampler increases the dimension of the parameter space from @xmath7 ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number of observations . as strong correlations between parameters and large sample sizes",
    "are common in the @xmath0-stable setting , this results in a slowly mixing markov chain since gibbs moves are limited to moving parallel to the axes ( e.g. ) .",
    "other markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) samplers ( ) adopt inversion techniques for numerical integration of the characteristic function , employing inverse fourier transforms combined with a series expansion to accurately estimate distributional tails .",
    "this is performed at each iteration of the markov chain to evaluate the likelihood , and is accordingly computationally intensive .",
    "in addition the quality of the resulting approximation is sensitive to the spacing of the fast fourier transform grid and the point at which the series expansion begins ( ) .",
    "univariate density estimation methods include integral representations , parametric mixtures (; ) and numerical estimation through splines and series expansions (; ) .",
    "approximates symmetric stable distributions using a mixture of gaussian and cauchy densities . and approximate the @xmath0-stable density through spline polynomials , and via a mixture of gaussian distributions .",
    "parameter estimation has been performed by an expectation - maximization ( em ) algorithm and by method of ( partial ) moments ( ) . implemented within an mcmc sampler , such density estimation methods would be highly computational .",
    "none of the above methods easily generalize to the multivariate setting .",
    "it is currently only practical to numerically evaluate two dimensional @xmath0-stable densities via inversion of the characteristic function . here",
    "the required computation is a function of @xmath0 and the number and spread of masses in the discrete spectral representation (; ) . beyond two dimensions this procedure becomes untenably slow with limited accuracy .    in this article",
    "we develop practical bayesian inferential methods to fit univariate and multivariate @xmath0-stable models . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no practical bayesian methods have been developed for the multivariate model as the required computational complexity increases dramatically with model dimension .",
    "the same is true of classical methods beyond two dimensions .",
    "our approach is based on recent developments in `` likelihood - free '' inference , which permits approximate posterior simulation for bayesian models without the need to explicitly evaluate the likelihood .    in section [ sec : abc ] we briefly introduce likelihood - free inference and the sampling framework used in this article .",
    "section [ sec : alpha - stable ] presents the bayesian @xmath0-stable model , with a particular focus on summary statistic specification , a critical component of likelihood - free inference .",
    "we provide an evaluation of the performance of the proposed methodology in section [ sec : examples ] , based on controlled simulation studies in 1 , 2 and 3 dimensions .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : realdata ] we demonstrate an analysis of real daily currency data under both univariate and multivariate settings , and provide comparisons with existing methods .",
    "we conclude with a discussion .",
    "computational procedures to simulate from posterior distributions , @xmath12 , of parameters @xmath13 given observed data @xmath14 , are well established ( e.g. ) .",
    "however when pointwise evaluation of the likelihood function @xmath15 is computationally prohibitive or intractable , alternative procedures are required .",
    "likelihood - free methods ( also known as _ approximate bayesian computation _ ) permit simulation from an approximate posterior model while circumventing explicit evaluation of the likelihood function (; ; ; ; ) .",
    "assuming data simulation @xmath16 under the model given @xmath17 is easily obtainable , likelihood - free methods embed the posterior @xmath15 within an augmented model @xmath18 where @xmath16 , @xmath19 , is an auxiliary parameter on the same space as the observed data @xmath20 .",
    "the function @xmath21 is typically a standard smoothing kernel ( e.g. ) with scale parameter @xmath22 , which weights the intractable posterior with high values in regions when the observed data @xmath20 and auxiliary data @xmath23 are similar .",
    "for example , uniform kernels are commonplace in likelihood - free models ( e.g. ) , although alternatives such as epanechnikov and gaussian kernels provide improved efficiency .",
    "the resulting approximation to the true posterior target distribution @xmath24\\ ] ] improves as @xmath22 decreases , and exactly recovers the target posterior as @xmath25 , as then @xmath26 becomes a point mass at @xmath27 .",
    "posterior simulation from @xmath28 can then proceed via standard simulation algorithms , replacing pointwise evaluations of @xmath28 with monte carlo estimates through the expectation ( [ eqn : marginal - posterior ] ) , based on draws @xmath29 from the model ( e.g. ) .",
    "alternatively , simulation from the joint posterior @xmath30 is available by contriving to cancel the intractable likelihoods @xmath31 in sample weights or acceptance probabilities . for example , importance sampling from the prior predictive distribution @xmath32 results in an importance weight of @xmath33 , which is free of likelihood terms .",
    "see for a discussion of marginal and joint - space likelihood - free samplers .    in general",
    ", the distribution of @xmath31 will be diffuse , unless @xmath23 is discrete and @xmath34 is small . hence , generating @xmath35 with @xmath36 is improbable for realistic datasets @xmath20 , and as a result the degree of computation required for a good likelihood - free approximation @xmath37 ( i.e. with small @xmath22 ) will be prohibitive . in practice , the function @xmath21 is expressed through low dimensional vectors of summary statistics , @xmath38 , such that @xmath21 weights the intractable posterior through ( [ eqn : joint - posterior ] ) with high values in regions where @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath38 is sufficient for @xmath17 , then letting @xmath25 recovers @xmath40 as before , but with more acceptable computational overheads , as @xmath41 . as sufficient summary statistics are generally unavailable ,",
    "the use of non - sufficient statistics is commonplace .",
    "the effect of less efficient estimators of @xmath17 in ( [ eqn : marginal - posterior ] ) is a more diffuse approximation of @xmath42 .",
    "hence the choice of summary statistics in any application is critical , with the ideal being low - dimensional , efficient and near - sufficient .    in this article",
    ", we implement the likelihood - free sequential monte carlo sampler of , detailed in appendix a. as the class of particle - based algorithms is the most efficient currently available in likelihood - free computation ( e.g. ) , and within this class , the sampler of is the only one to allow non - uniform functions @xmath21 , this sampler provides the best combination of efficient simulation and flexible modelling .",
    "we now develop univariate and multivariate bayesian @xmath0-stable models . unlike existing methods ,",
    "likelihood - free inference is independent of model parameterization .",
    "denote the characteristic function of @xmath11 i.i.d .",

    "the intractable stable density function is continuous and unimodal , taking support on @xmath48 if @xmath49 ; @xmath50 if @xmath51 and @xmath52 otherwise .",
    "efficient simulation of auxiliary data , @xmath16 , under the model is critical for the performance of likelihood - free methods ( section [ sec : abc ] ) . here , it is straightforward to generate @xmath0-stable variates under the model defined by the characteristic function ( [ alphastablecharacteristicfn ] ) ( e.g. ; ) .",
    "this approach is provided in appendix b.      a key component of likelihood - free inference is the availability of low - dimensional , efficient and near - sufficient summary statistics . since @xmath0-stable models can possess infinite variance ( @xmath53 ) and infinite mean ( @xmath54 ) , this choice must be made with care .",
    "here we present several candidate summary vectors , @xmath55@xmath56 , previously utilized for parameter estimation in the univariate @xmath0-stable model . in section [ sec : examples ] we evaluate the performance of these vectors , and provide informed recommendations for the choice of summary statistics under the likelihood - free framework .    0.5 cm _",
