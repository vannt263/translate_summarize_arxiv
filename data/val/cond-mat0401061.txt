    "one of the fundamental problems in the foundations of statistical mechanics is to give an explanation as to why ` equilibrium ' statistical mechanics is so successful . that is to say , why the use of the standard gibbsian methods ` reproduces ' thermodynamic results .",

    "we propose that equilibrium as a binary property is replaced by something ( which we call commonness ) which encapsulates degrees of ` equilibriumness ' .",
    "most examples of the use of this approach consider situations where the macrovariables measure inhomogeneities in the distribution of microsystems over the one - microsystem phase space .",

    "the question of entropy can be subsumed into a more general account of the relationship between statistical mechanical and thermodynamic variables . as we have indicated in sec .",

    "the primary example of c3 is the entropy given by the gibbs formula ( [ gibbs3 ] ) .. ] in the interests of producing a smooth relationship between the boltzmann and gibbs approaches we shall make two modifications to the c1c3 scheme .",
    "the first , which is part of the standard boltzmann approach , is to related thermodynamic entropy to a phase function ( which is also a macrovariable ) , namely the boltzmann entropy @xmath202 ; so entropy is now of type c1 . the second is to propose a particular relationship , in the case of c1 variables , between thermodynamic variables and phase functions .    in sec",
    ".  [ approaches ] we introduced the set @xmath48 of macrovariables defined on the macrostates @xmath50 .",

    "the statistical mechanical variable is the macrovariable @xmath206 . in the case of entropy",
    "the phase function and macrovariable are identical and equal to the boltzmann entropy . for other thermodynamic quantities",
    "this is not the case .",

    "this perception together with the definition of macrostates and the boltzmann entropy in sec .",
    "[ approaches ] serves as the demarcation between the microscopic and macroscopic realms . of course , this demarcation is to some extent arbitrary , but it is equally so for any macroscopic physical theory . the value of the thermodynamic quantity @xmath203 , along the trajectory @xmath210 passing through @xmath166 , we take to be equal to the average of the result of a large number of measurements of @xmath206 taken at arbitrarily chosen times .",
    "so we can effectively define @xmath211 @xmath203 is a constant of motion , but not constant on @xmath20 except when the system is ergodic .",
    "when @xmath20 has the ergodic decomposition ( [ tl1 ] ) , @xmath203 has the set of values @xmath212 from ( [ mer1a ] ) , when the behaviour in @xmath136 is thermodynamic - like , @xmath213 measurement of the thermodynamic variable @xmath203 will typically lead to a value close to @xmath214 .",
    "we now need to be more precise about what we mean by the macrovariable @xmath206 .",
    "ideally , of course , the identification @xmath215 in the notation of ( [ prob102 ] ) , would be desirable , because then it follows from ( [ merger2aa ] ) , that , for thermodynamic - like behaviour , @xmath216 this , to within the tolerance indicated by ` @xmath217 ' , is the standard identification between thermodynamic variables and the expectation values of phase functions in gibbs theory . as we have observed in sec",
    ".  [ prob ] , ( [ merger3 ] ) is exactly true for the boltzmann entropy because it is , by definition , constant over each macrostate .",
    "we should not expect this to be true for all phase functions .",

    "in particular we shall assume @xmath204 is ( a ) continuous on each macrostate and",

    "although the macrostate @xmath49 may be a very large part of @xmath20 it will be made of a large number of cells in each of which @xmath204 has the same nearly constant value .",

    "b.   the thermodynamic variable is approximated along ( typical ) thermodynamic - like trajectories by the average of @xmath183 with respect to the probability density function @xmath1 .",
    "this establishes the relationship between a boltzmannian view of thermodynamic variables as time averages and the gibbsian view in which they are phase averages with respect to the appropriate probability density function .",
    "we now consider in more detail the case of entropy .",
    "it is often said that in `` equilibrium [ the gibbs entropy ] agrees with boltzmann and clausius entropies ( up to terms that are negligible when the number of particles is large ) and everything is fine '' @xcite . apart from the caveats we have entered in sec .",
    "[ ttde ] with respect to the concept of equilibrium , this assertion is based on two propositions ( i ) that the appropriate probability density function for the gibbs approach is given by the microcanonical distribution ( [ assum2 ] ) and ( ii ) that for large @xmath25 the ` equilibrium ' macrostate effectively fills the whole of @xmath20 .",
    "the first of these we have established , within our approach , for a system with an ergodic decomposition and with the choice of probabilities ( [ assum1 ] ) . in the case where macrostates are defined using the cell method described in sec .",

    "( b ) in an ergodic system the infinite time average can be shown , for all but a set of measure zero , to be equal to the macrostate average with respect to an invariant normalized measure which is unique .",
    "the traditional objections to this argument are also well known : ( i ) measurements may be regarded as time averages , but they are not _ infinite _ time averages .",

    "( ii ) ergodic results are all to within sets of measure zero and one can not equate such sets with events with zero probability of occurrence .",
    "( iii ) rather few systems have been shown to be ergodic .",
    "so one must look for a reason for the success of equilibrium statistical mechanics for non - ergodic systems and when it is found it will make the ergodicity of ergodic systems irrelevant as well .",
    "our use of ergodicity differs substantially from that described above and it thus escapes wholly or partly the strictures applied to it . in respect of the question of equilibrium / non - equilibrium",

    "the phase point of the system , in its passage along a trajectory , passes through common ( high entropy ) and uncommon ( low entropy ) macrostates _ and that is all_. so , although in our definition of a thermodynamic variable we have extended a large finite number of measurements to an infinite set of measurements , we can not be charged with ` blurring out ' the period when the system was not in equilibrium .",
