    "for example , for @xmath198 , the temperature just behind the shock changes from @xmath199 at @xmath179 to @xmath200 at @xmath201 ; the resulting temperature behind the magnetic detonation front changes from @xmath202 at @xmath179 to @xmath203 at @xmath204 . however , these moderate modifications of temperature , together with respective modifications of the activation energy , lead to dramatic changes in the characteristic spin - switching time at the shock , @xmath205 , and at the final detonation temperature , @xmath206 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau_vs_angle ] . for example",
    ", for the same magnetic field strength as used in the above example , @xmath198 , we find the reversal time behind the leading shock @xmath207 at @xmath179 and @xmath208 at @xmath201 ; thus we observe variations of the reversal time by six orders of magnitude .",
    "such an increase of the spin - reversal time makes the magnetic detonation front unrealistically wide at large angles so that magnetic detonation becomes impossible for noticeable misalignment between the external magnetic field and the easy axis .",

    "the magnetic anisotropy affects primarily two values of the key importance for the magnetic deflagration and detonation dynamics  the activation energy and the zeeman energy . here , we calculated the activation and zeeman energies as a solution to the quantum - mechanical problem of a single nanomagnet of @xmath121-acetate placed in the external magnetic field , which is then reversed .",
    "we demonstrated strong dependence of the activation and zeeman energies on the strength and direction of the external magnetic field .",
