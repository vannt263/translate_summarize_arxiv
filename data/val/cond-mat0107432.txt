    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation in dilute atomic gases @xcite , has led to a large increase in the amount of both experimental and theoretical research on these quantum systems .",
    "various theoretical predictions regarding equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of degenerate bose gases , can now be directly compared with experimental data .",
    "regarding the zero - temperature behaviour of a bose - einstein condensate , a great deal of the physics is well described by the gross - pitaevskii equation , i.e. , a mean - field equation for the macroscopic wave function of the condensate . it has led to very good agreement with experimental results on , for example , the condensate collective mode frequencies and the density profile of the condensate at zero temperature @xcite . to understand the nonzero temperature behaviour of bose - condensed gases",
    ", several proposals have been made to generalize the gross - pitaevskii equation and to include the effects of the thermal cloud on the condensate . at the mean - field level",
    "this is achieved by introducing in the gross - pitaevskii equation real and imaginary terms , that describe the coherent and incoherent effects of collisions between condensate and thermal atoms , and that in particular cause evaporation or growth of the condensate @xcite . however , at nonzero temperatures also fluctuations can play an important role .",
    "an example of this is the reversible formation of a condensate , as experimentally achieved by stamper - kurn _ et al .",
    "since the system is several times in the critical region , fluctuations of the order parameter around its mean - field value are of utmost importance to describe this experiment @xcite .",
    "in addition , both quantum and thermal fluctuations are important to understand the stochastic nature of the collapse observed in @xmath0li @xcite and the phenomena of phase ` diffusion ' @xcite , in which case these fluctuations disturb the global phase of the condensate .",
    "finally , from a fundamental point of view , a consistent description of a partially bose - einstein condensed gas requires that the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is obeyed , since this ensures relaxation of the system towards its correct physical equilibrium .",
    "therefore , if dissipation is to be included in the generalized gross - pitaevskii equation , fluctuations must also be included .",
    "gardiner and zoller have included such fluctuations in the description of a bose - condensed system by deriving with second - order perturbation theory a master equation for the one - body density matrix @xcite , a procedure well - known from quantum optics .",
    "however , in this paper we will use the nonperturbative formulation developed previously by one of us @xcite . using field - theoretical techniques stoof derived a fokker - planck equation describing the full nonequilibrium probability distribution of the order parameter .",
    "an equivalent formulation of this theory can be given in terms of a dissipative nonlinear schrdinger equation with noise .",
    "although in principle we can turn to numerical methods for the solution of the fokker - planck equation , or its corresponding langevin equation @xcite , we find it more convenient here to proceed analytically , by means of a variational method .",
    "variational approximations have previously provided a useful way to make analytical progress , and capture as many of the physics as possible . in particular , when applied to the zero - temperature gross - pitaevskii equation , a gaussian variational approximation has led to good results on the collective modes of the condensate @xcite , and on the description of the macroscopic tunneling of a condensate with attractive interactions @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to apply a similar variational method also to the dissipative nonlinear schrdinger equation with noise appropriate for nonzero temperatures .",
    "we achieve this by assuming that the thermal cloud is in equilibrium at all times , and therefore acts as a ` heat bath ' on the condensate .",
    "the stochastic nonlinear schrdinger equation then obeys an equilibrium version of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , which ensures that the condensate relaxes to the physically correct equilibrium . with this assumption , we are then able to derive langevin equations for the variational parameters in our gaussian _ ansatz _ , which turn out to be equivalent to the equations of motion for a brownian particle in a potential . these equations are coupled to a stochastic rate equation for the number of atoms in the condensate . using these equations of motion , we are then able to describe collisional damping of the condensate collective modes at nonzero temperatures , and the condensate growth and stochastic initiation of the collapse , as recently observed in @xmath0li @xcite .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . to make this paper selfcontained , we review in sec .",

    "we use the method of functional integration throughout this paper . in sec .",
    "iii we review the fokker - planck equation describing the nonequilibrium dynamics of a bose - einstein condensed gas , and discuss the equilibrium solution of this fokker - planck equation .",
    "the most important result of this section is the langevin field equation for the order parameter , that obeys the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "this langevin field equation takes the form of a dissipative nonlinear schrdinger equation with noise .",
    "we also derive the stochastic equations of motion for the density and phase of the condensate , and a damped wave equation describing the propagation of sound waves in a homogeneous bose gas , at nonzero temperatures . in sec .",
    "iv we present the variational approximation to our nonlinear dissipative schdinger equation with noise , and also derive stochastic equations of motion for the variational parameters , which are the central result of this paper . to the best of our knowledge , a variational method for stochastic field equations , such as the stochastic non - linear schrdinger equation under consideration here , has not been developed previously . in sec .",
    "v we apply our equations to calculate the temperature dependence of the damping and frequencies of the collective modes of a condensate , and to obtain a description of a growth - collapse curve of a condensate with attractive interactions .",
