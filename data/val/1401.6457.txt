    "one of the cleanest signatures in indirect dark matter ( dm ) searches are peaks in the cosmic gamma ray spectrum from the galactic center or other regions of high dm density .",
    "on the one hand , there are no known astrophysical sources that could mimic such a signal . on the other hand , gamma ray observatories are making tremendous progress in terms of statistics , resolution and control of systematic uncertainties .    from the particle physics point of view",
    ", peaks in the gamma ray spectrum can originate from dm annihilation or decay to two photons , a photon and a @xmath3 boson , or a photon and a higgs boson .",
    "however , since dm is electrically neutral , these processes can only happen at the 1-loop level , making it likely that dm is first discovered in other annihilation or decay channels .",
    "there is , however , a class of models where the first experimental hint for dm is a gamma ray peak .",
    "namely , this can happen in models where dm annihilates via a charged @xmath0-channel mediator , so that a photon can be emitted from the mediator , see fig .  [",
    "fig : vib - diagrams ] .",
    "this process is called virtual internal bremsstrahlung ( vib )  @xcite . if the mediator mass @xmath4 and the dm mass @xmath5 are close to each other , the resulting photon energy is strongly peaked ( see  fig .  [",
    "fig : vdsigmadx ] ) and can yield a line - like gamma ray signal if the width of the peak is below the detector resolution .    of particular interest in this context",
    "are models in which the dm couples preferentially to leptons .",
    "these leptophilic dark matter ( ldm ) models are motivated by the fact that dm couplings to quarks are strongly constrained by gamma ray emission from dwarf galaxies  @xcite , by direct detection bounds  @xcite , and by lhc searches  @xcite . additional motivation could be provided by various cosmic ray anomalies .",
    "for instance , attempts to explain the cosmic ray positron excess observed by pamela  @xcite , fermi - lat  @xcite and ams-02  @xcite in terms of dm annihilation typically require a leptophilic dm model  @xcite in order not to exceed the measured antiproton flux  @xcite .",
    "finally , it is intriguing that the possible anomalies in the gamma ray signal from the galactic center  @xcite , in the gamma ray emission from the fermi bubbles  @xcite , and in radio signals from filamentary structures in the inner galaxy  @xcite could be explained in leptophilic dm models .",
    "( note , however , that some of them can also be understood if dark matter annihilates to @xmath6 final states . ) direct detection constraints on leptophilic dm have been studied in  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we derive new constraints on leptophilic dm , and we translate these constraints into bounds on the cross section for internal bremsstrahlung .",
    "we also discuss the prospects for probing the parameter space of leptophilic dm even further with future experiments .",
    "we work in a simplified model which augments the standard model ( sm ) by a fermionic dm candidate @xmath2 and a charged scalar mediator @xmath1 , with a coupling of the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a charged lepton field .",
    "this effective scenario can be realized in supersymmetry ( susy ) ( see for instance  @xcite ) , where @xmath2 could be identified with the lightest neutralino , and @xmath1 would be a slepton .",
    "it also applies to certain radiative neutrino mass models , whose direct detection phenomenology has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "a simplified framework of the form used here has been employed , for instance , to explain an anomalous line - like feature at @xmath9  gev in the fermi - lat gamma ray data  @xcite . even though the statistical significance of this feature is not yet convincing  @xcite , and there are ( inconclusive ) indications that poorly understood systematic effects may play a role  @xcite , it demonstrates the relevance of internal bremsstrahlung signatures as considered here if anomalous peaked features are found in future gamma ray observations .",
    "our starting point is the observation that even in leptophilic models , loop processes endow the dm with nonzero electromagnetic moments , which in turn allow it to interact in direct detection experiments .",
    "if dm is a majorana fermion , only an anapole moment is generated  @xcite , while for dirac fermions , also a magnetic dipole moment can exist .",
    "dm with anapole interactions has been studied previously in @xcite using an effective field theory framework , and dm with magnetic dipole moments has been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the importance of loop processes even for hadrophilic dm has been studied in the context of lhc searches in  @xcite .",
    "-channel mediator . for dirac",
    "dm , the second row of diagrams is absent .",
    "note that only the sum of vib and final state radiation diagrams is gauge invariant.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    loop processes involving dm particles can also modify electromagnetic properties of leptons , in particular their anomalous magnetic moments and the energy levels of dilepton systems such as positronium and muonium . in the most general case",
    ", also lepton flavor violation could be induced by dm loops . finally ,",
    "if dm couples to electrons , it can be directly produced at lep or at a future linear collider , allowing us to derive constraints from searches for mono - photons plus missing energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ldm ] , we introduce the simplified model framework which we will use in the rest of the paper , we establish its connection to supersymmetric scenarios , and we review the expected indirect detection ( internal bremsstrahlung ) signals from dm annihilation in this model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dd - limits ] , we compute the electromagnetic form factors of dm and the resulting direct detection cross sections . we compare these to lux  @xcite and xenon100  @xcite data , and to the expected future sensitivity of xenon1 t and lux - zeplin to derive constraints .",
    "we translate these constraints into limits on the intensity of possible internal bremsstrahlung signals .",
    "to illustrate the strength of direct detection limits , we show that for flavor - universal dm couplings to leptons , the explanation of the aforementioned 135  gev feature in the fermi - lat data  @xcite in terms of internal bremsstrahlung is severely constrained .",
    "we then investigate in sec .",
    "[ sec : collider ] the complementary constraints from @xmath10 collider data , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : ewpt ] the bounds from measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the electron , from searches for lepton flavor violation , and from possible future experiments on true muonium spectroscopy .",
    "we summarize our findings and conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the simplest theoretical models that feature internal bremsstrahlung in dm annihilation extend the standard model by a neutral dm candidate @xmath2 and a charged mediator @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 can be either a majorana fermion ( as in most supersymmetric theories ) or a dirac fermion ( as for example in supersymmetric theories with preserved @xmath11-symmetry  @xcite ) . as explained above , we are mostly interested in leptophilic models because dm couplings to quarks are already tightly constrained . in the simplest case ,",
    "we thus start with the interaction lagrangian @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the photon field , @xmath2 is the fermionic dm candidate , @xmath14 is the unit electric charge , @xmath8 is a sm lepton field , @xmath15 is the right - handed chiral projection operator , and @xmath16 is the yukawa coupling constant of the dm  lepton interaction . unless indicated otherwise , we assume @xmath2 to be a majorana fermion .",
    "note that we have omitted couplings to left - handed leptons here which are more strongly constrained ( though not ruled out ) by collider searches and electroweak precision test  @xcite .",
    "we also do not consider the scalar potential for @xmath1 since these terms are irrelevant to our discussion .",
    "finally , we disregard the vertex @xmath17 from the kinetic term of @xmath1 because it is higher order in the coupling constant and will thus be phenomenologically negligible .",
    "the simplified model has been studied previously for instance in @xcite , and it has been shown in @xcite that the model could explain the 135  gev feature in the fermi - lat data .",
    "the fit from @xcite results in a preferred dm mass of @xmath18 and an annihilation cross section @xmath19 .",
    "( here , @xmath20 is the relative velocity of the two annihilating dm particles , and the average @xmath21 is taken over @xmath20 . )",
    "the interactions in eq .   lead to annihilation of dm particles into pairs of sm leptons via @xmath0-channel exchange of the charged scalar @xmath1 .",
    "this @xmath22 process can be decomposed into an @xmath23-wave part and a @xmath24-wave part , the latter of which can usually be neglected because it is suppressed by the square of the small velocity @xmath25  km / s of dm particles in the milky way .",
    "the @xmath23-wave contribution is unsuppressed for dirac dm , while for majorana dm , it is helicity - suppressed by the small mass of the final state lepton  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by noting that dm annihilation through the yukawa interaction in eq",
    ".   produces two leptons of the same chirality . for majorana dm",
    ", however , pauli blocking in the initial state requires the incoming dm particles to have opposite spin .",
    "angular momentum conservation therefore requires a mass insertion on one of the final state lepton lines .",
    "thus , for majorana dm , higher order annihilation processes become important , in particular the @xmath26 process @xmath27 , with two charged leptons and a photon in the final state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vib - diagrams ] ) .",
    "since the photon carries away one unit of angular momentum , it can lift the helicity suppression , see for instance  @xcite .    a helicity suppression of 2-body dm annihilation compared to the 3-body internal bremsstrahlung process exists also in models where the scalar mediator @xmath1 is replaced by a vector particle  @xcite and in models with scalar dm and fermionic mediators  @xcite .",
    "we will not consider these possibilities here , but will instead focus on the scenario from eq .   as a representative for all internal bremsstrahlung models .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we have seen in eq .",
    "that in our simplified model setup , at least one of the yukawa couplings should be of order 0.11 to avoid dm overproduction .",
    "the above constraints show that flavor off - diagonal yukawa couplings are therefore always subdominant .",
    "this justifies our neglecting them in the preceding sections .",
    "we have also studied the decay @xmath28 , which constrains a different combination of yukawa couplings because it also receives contributions from box diagrams similar to fig .  [",
    "fig : box ] .",
    "if we assume that flavor - diagonal yukawa couplings are @xmath29 , we obtain limits on the flavor off - diagonal couplings that are about a factor of 8 weaker than the limit from @xmath30 .",
    "to arrive at this estimate , we have used ref .",
    "@xcite to express @xmath31 in terms of the wilson coefficients of the effective operators in eqs .   and .",
    "we have then compared the predicted branching ratio to the current experimental limit from  @xcite .",
    "note that planned searches for @xmath28 will improve the limit on @xmath31 by up to four orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have studied leptophilic dark matter models in which dm annihilation proceeds through a charged mediator and can therefore be accompanied by emission of a virtual internal bremsstrahlung photon .",
    "such models are of great interest for indirect dark matter searches because internal bremsstrahlung can lead to spectral peaks in the gamma ray sky , a feature which is easily distinguishable from the large astrophysical gamma ray flux .",
    "leptophilic dm models are also well motivated theoretically : they can be realized for instance in supersymmetric scenarios or radiative neutrino mass models , and in most cases , their parameter space is relatively unconstrained .    here",
    ", we have established a connection between internal bremsstrahlung signals and loop - induced electromagnetic form factors of dm particles in leptophilic models . in particular , upon connecting the charged lepton lines in the internal bremsstrahlung diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : vib - diagrams ] to a loop , one immediately obtains the electromagnetic vertex corrections in fig .",
    "[ fig : em - moment - loops ] . for majorana",
    "dm , these lead to an anapole moment , while for dirac dm , both anapole and magnetic dipole moments are generated , with the dipole moment being dominant in dm scattering processes .",
    "interactions of the anapole and dipole moments with atomic nuclei then allow us to constrain the internal bremsstrahlung cross section using dm ",
    "nucleus scattering data from direct detection experiments . we have carried out this analysis for the most recent lux and xenon100 data , and have found that direct detection constraints can be competitive with internal bremsstrahlung searches .",
    "this is true in particular if the mass splitting between the dm particle @xmath2 and the charged mediator @xmath1 is very small  the case which is also most interesting for internal bremsstrahlung searches due to the peaked gamma ray spectrum .    if dm is a majorana fermion that couples universally to all charged leptons , direct detection limits are of the same order as limits from gamma ray line searches , and better than continuum gamma ray constraints from dwarf galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : limits - sigmav ] ( b ) ) .",
    "specifically , for small mass splitting @xmath32 , lux constrains the internal bremsstrahlung cross section @xmath33 to be below @xmath34  @xmath35/s at @xmath36  gev . at dm masses of order 100  gev , which have been invoked previously to explain a bump in fermi - lat gamma ray data  @xcite ,",
    "lux constraints imply that this interpretation is disfavored if dm couples to electrons or muons and if @xmath4 and @xmath5 differ by @xmath37 .",
    "if the last condition is significantly violated , however , the expected bump in the gamma ray spectrum becomes relatively broad , making line searches less sensitive .",
    "if @xmath38 , also direct searches for the charged mediator @xmath1 at colliders will impose important constraints , disfavoring @xmath39  gev  @xcite .",
    "these constraints are ineffective if @xmath40 because the leptons from @xmath1 decay will be very soft in this case and thus hard to detect .",
    "we note an interesting connection between our results and the scenario studied by konishi et al .",
    "@xcite to solve the cosmological lithium-7 problem in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) with sleptons that are nearly mass degenerate with the lightest neutralino . for the preferred mass range from  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath41 , this scenario would predict @xmath42  @xmath35/s , well within the region testable by next generation direct detection experiments .    if dm is a dirac fermion and the masses of @xmath2 and @xmath1 are of the same order of magnitude , but still differ by @xmath43 so that coannihilations are not yet relevant ) , direct detection constraints disfavor thermal relic production of dm for @xmath5 between 1020  gev and up to a few hundred gev ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : limits - sigmav ] ( d ) ) . for @xmath44  gev ,",
    "direct detection limits are also significantly stronger than astrophysical limits from gamma ray line searches and from continuum gamma rays searches in dwarf galaxies .    in the future , we expect the xenon1 t and lux - zeplin experiments to improve these direct detection limits by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "these experiments will thus test the thermal relic hypothesis for dm masses of order @xmath45 , except for scenarios with a per cent level degeneracy between @xmath5 and @xmath4 , where coannihilations dominate in the early universe .",
    "if a signal is detected , the spectrum of recoil events can be used to discriminate between anapole and dipole interaction and hence between majorana and dirac dm .",
    "we have also studied constraints on our simplified model from low energy precision experiments .",
    "we confirm that bounds from the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath46 of the electron and the muon are weaker than the direct detection constraints at @xmath47  gev .",
    "searches for the lepton flavor violating decays @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath30 and @xmath28 are very powerful in setting bounds on dm annihilation into flavor violating final states .",
    "finally , we have studied the possibility of obtaining constraints from a future measurement of the hyperfine splitting in true muonium ( a @xmath50 bound state ) .",
    "we have found such a measurement to be challenging for heavy dm ( @xmath51  gev ) , where excluding thermal relic dm would require a measurement with a relative accuracy better than @xmath52 ( see eq .  ) . for lighter dm ( @xmath53  gev ) , however , requirements are weaker and an interesting measurement may be possible .    in summary ,",
    "our results show that direct dark matter searches are powerful tools to search for leptophilic dm even though dm ",
    "nucleus scattering occurs only at the loop level in this case .",
    "they are complementary to , and sometimes significantly superior to , indirect searches and precision experiments . particularly in a scenario where a peak is observed in the cosmic gamma ray spectrum , but no other indirect hints for dm",
    "are found , virtual internal bremsstrahlung in a leptophilic dm model provides an attractive explanation .",
    "our results show how this scenario can be confirmed in direct detection experiments by looking for the electromagnetic moment interactions of dm with nuclei .",
    "this illustrates once again that the search for dark matter is an interdisciplinary task , and that only a combination of different search strategies can yield optimal results .",
