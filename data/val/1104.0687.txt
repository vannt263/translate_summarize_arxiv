    "recent surveys with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) @xcite , as well as earlier observations with the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) , probe the dust emission at much fainter levels than that has been reached by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ) .",
    "this has vastly improved our understanding of galaxy evolution .",

    "first established the local benchmark for mid- and far - ir luminosity functions ( lfs ) @xcite . in the nineties ,",
    "15@xmath0 m isocam observations were used to derive the 15@xmath0 m lf @xcite at low redshift , as well as to study the evolution effects from the number counts @xcite .",
    "the recent work of @xcite has constrained the slope of the ir and uv lfs at the extreme faint end for the first time using large datasets of local galaxies , and has derived the distribution function of star formation rate in the local universe .",
    "deep mips surveys carried out in the past few years fertilized the ground for understanding the evolution of lf .",
    "@xcite illustrated the variation of 15@xmath0 m lf in the range of 0.3@xmath61.2 and suggested that the comoving ir energy density evolves dramatically , increasing with look - back time as ( 1+z)@xmath7 up to z@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "ir bright galaxies emit the bulk of their energy as dust - reprocessed light generated by dusty star formation ( sf ) or accretion onto the supermassive blackholes , referred to hereafter as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . obtaining information on the relative contribution of",
    "sf / agn is critical for understanding a galaxy s integrated emission .",
    "@xcite explored the star - formation history at 0.3@xmath1z@xmath11.2 .",
    "however , the mips 24@xmath0 m photometry they used for that study did not allow them to account for the agn contribution , or constrain the relationship between the stellar mass growth and blackhole mass growth .",
    "recent work of @xcite have identified agn dominated sources and excluded these objects from their samples to derive the sf lfs .",
    "the shape of lf depends on the rest - frame wavelength .",
    "uv / optical lf usually follows the profile of a schechter function @xcite , while at mid / far - ir wavelengths , the bright end slope is observed to be shallower than the exponential cut - off of a schechter function @xcite .",
    "this is rather intriguing because both uv and far - ir emission traces the same star - formation , and the different shapes for the lfs are suggested to be a result of dust extinction effect .",
    "the recent work of @xcite claims that the shallower slope of the ir lf could be due to the contribution of agn at the high luminosity end and when the agn component is removed , the sf lf can be fit with a schechter function .",
    "this further motivates our work of separating the sf and agn emission in our objects to understand their contribution to the lf .    to quantify the relative contribution of star - formation and agn to the infrared luminosities ,",
    "spectral decompositions have been performed by several groups @xcite . in high mid - ir luminosity systems at z@xmath22 , @xcite found an average agn fraction of @xmath8 of total ir luminosity for strong pah sources while this number goes up to @xmath970% for weak - pah sources .",
    "the study of @xcite of a sample of submm galaxies at similar redshift has revealed at most a 30% contribution from agn at mid - ir ( 5 - 11.5@xmath0 m rest - frame ) . in the local universe",
    ", the contribution of nuclear activity to the bolometric luminosity of ulirgs has been quantified with six independent methods by @xcite , reaching an average agn contribution of @xmath10 , whereas @xcite suggest that intense star formation accounts for 85% of the ir emission in local ulirgs , with agn contributing 15% .",
    "it is clear that the relative contribution of sf / agn varies in galaxies of different luminosities @xcite , with the agn playing more critical roles in more luminous systems .",
    "it must also be a function of wavelength , since the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the two components are quite distinct .",
    "the different selection criteria and decomposition techniques among different samples and authors also add to the differences derived in the relative contribution of sf and agn .",
    "current studies on ir lfs are mostly based on mips 24@xmath0 m observations , which implies a heavy reliance on the sed library used to make k - corrections and derive the monochromatic continuum or total infrared luminosities .",
    "recently , @xcite have derived 8@xmath0 m and 15@xmath0 m lfs , as well as the corresponding star - formation lf , for a sample of z@xmath20.7 objects , taking advantage of their irs spectra . the 5 millijansky unbiased extragalactic survey ( 5muses ) ,",
    "an infrared spectroscopic survey of 330 objects selected by their mips 24@xmath0 m flux densities , provides an important sample for understanding the infrared galaxy population ( helou et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "although ir luminosity functions have been extensively studied at low redshift , we find 5muses to be a unique sample for deriving lf for the following reasons : 1 .",
    "being a mid - ir flux - limited sample , we reach a wide range of infrared luminosity ( @xmath210@xmath11l@xmath12 to @xmath210@xmath13l@xmath12 ) .",
    "we reach to higher redshifts than previous samples , e.g. the rbgs @xcite .",
    "the irs spectra of our sample and far - ir measurements for most of them allow us to minimize the uncertainties on k - correction and luminosity estimation associated with adopting specific seds to be applied to all sources .",
    "4 . last but not least , the irs spectra allow for a careful decomposition of every single source into a sf and agn component and estimation of their contribution to the luminosity density .",
    "this will facilitate further studies on how the sf / agn fraction in the integrated luminosity density evolves in a cosmological context .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the sample selection , and then the infrared and optical data used in this study .",
    "we introduce our methodology of using the 1/v@xmath14 method to derive luminosity function in section 3 , where we also demonstrate how we correct for the incompleteness of the 5muses sample . in the same section ,",
    "we discuss in detail our methods of the sf / agn decomposition of the irs spectra and how we estimate the sf contribution in a statistical sense .",
    "the 15 and 24@xmath0 m lfs , as well as the corresponding sf lfs are presented in section 4 , together with a discussion of how the star - formation fraction varies with luminosity and wavelength .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section 5 . throughout this paper , we assume a @xmath15cdm cosmology with @xmath1670kms@xmath17 , @xmath18=0.27 and @xmath19=0.73 .",

    "the sources are selected from the swire ( elais - n1 , elais - n2 , lockman hole and xmm ) and the extragalactic first look survey ( xfls ) fields , covering a total area of 40.6 square degrees on the sky .",
    "it provides a representative sample at intermediate redshift ( @xmath21 ) , previously unexplored by _ spitzer _",
    "since most of the spectroscopic work was focused on nearby spiral galaxies ( sings ) @xcite , local lirgs and ulirgs @xcite , and the much fainter and more distant ( z@xmath22 ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "a total of 1111 objects have f@xmath20(24@xmath0 m ) between 5 and 100mjy from the five survey fields of 5muses excluding stars . in order to efficiently observe the objects using the staring mode of irs and include the largest fraction of a galaxy s integrated light , only objects unresolved within an aperture of d=10.5@xmath22 ( corresponding approximately to the slit width of the long - low module of irs ) are included in the final pool and this results in a total of 800 sources .",
    "then 330 objects are randomly selected from the 800 final candidates .",
    "the details of the sample can be found in helou et al .",
    "( 2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "we have obtained low - resolution mid - ir spectra for all 330 objects in 5muses using the infrared spectrograph on board the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "both short - low ( sl : 5.2 - 14.5@xmath0 m ) and long - low ( ll : 14 - 37@xmath0 m ) modules are used , with spectral resolution of 64 - 128 .",
    "the integration time on each object ranges from 300 to 960 seconds to achieve roughly the same snr @xcite .",
    "the irs data are processed by the _",

    "then the background - subtracted cleaned spectrograms are reduced with the optimal extraction method of the _ spitzer _ irs custom extractor ( spice ) software to extract the 1-d spectra .",
    "the details on the reduction of the irs data can be found in @xcite .",
    "the irs spectra allow us to derive redshifts for sources with mid - ir emission and/or absorption features .",
    "we have also searched for optical spectra of our sample in the literature .",
    "a total of 50 5muses objects either do not have redshift information from the literature , or their irs spectra are characterized by featureless power law continua , which can not yield redshifts .",
    "we obtained redshifts for some of these sources by using the double spectrograph instrument on the palomar 200 inch telescope in 2009b and 2010a terms .",
    "the optical data are reduced with the iraf software using the standard routines for bias subtraction , flat - fielding , sky background removal and wavelength calibration . finally , for sources with multiple emission line features",
    ", redshifts are derived using all available emission lines .      combining the irs , palomar spectra and literature work",
    ", we found secure redshift measurements for 309 objects out of the 330 sources in 5muses ( 94% ) .",
    "the redshift distribution of 5muses is shown in figure [ fig : z_hist ] .",
    "we also show the redshift distribution for starburst , composite and agn - dominated sources respectively , which have been classified based on their apparent 6.2@xmath0 m pah ewsm pah ew@xmath230.5@xmath0 m are sb - dominated ; sources with 0.2@xmath0m@xmath1pah ew@xmath10.5@xmath0 m are composite ; and sources with pah ew@xmath10.2@xmath0 m are agn - dominated . ]",
    "( wu et al . 2010 ) .",
    "since we are only interested in the redshift range of z@xmath10.3 for this study , the relevant redshift completeness is close to 1 for two reasons : ( 1 ) the sources for which we are not able to find redshifts from 80 minutes of integration time on the palomar 200 inch telescope have very low r band to 24@xmath0 m band flux ratios f@xmath24(r)/f@xmath24(24@xmath0 m ) .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : z_rz ] , objects with low f@xmath24(r)/f@xmath24(24@xmath0 m ) ratios ( ie .",
    "log[f@xmath24(r)/f@xmath24(24@xmath0m)]@xmath1 - 2.6 ) are more likely to have high redshifts ( z@xmath230.3 ) ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( 2 ) the irs spectra of the sources without redshifts are characterized by featureless power - law continuum in the mid - ir .",
    "this indicates that they are most likely agn - dominated .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ fig : z_hist ] that the median redshift for agn - dominated sources is much higher than sb or composite sources .",
    "the median redshift for sources with 6.2@xmath0 m pah ew@xmath23 0.2@xmath0 m is 0.13 , while it is 0.40 for sources with 6.2@xmath0 m pah ew @xmath1 0.2@xmath0 m .",
    "thus these power law sources are much more likely to lie at the high end of the redshift distribution .    for this study , we focus on objects with z@xmath10.3 , which includes 226 objects . among the 21 ( 330 - 309 )",
    "sources without redshift , only 4 do not have very low f@xmath24(r)/f@xmath24(24@xmath0 m ) ratios , e.g. their log[f@xmath24(r)/f@xmath24(24@xmath0m)]@xmath23 - 2.6 , and might be located at z@xmath10.3 .",
    "this indicates that the redshift completeness for our sample at z@xmath10.3 is @xmath2598% .",
    "the targets for 5muses are randomly selected based on f@xmath24(24@xmath0m)@xmath235mjy after excluding the resolved objects . understanding the selection function for 5muses is crucial for building the luminosity function . because we exclude extended objects , it is likely that we have excluded more nearby objects than those at higher redshifts .",
    "thus when we derive the number density , instead of applying a uniform correction factor of @xmath23.4 ( @xmath26 ) , we need to investigate the selection effect in individual redshift bins before we build our luminosity function .",
    "redshift information is not available for all the sources in the parent sample of 5muses , thus we use the redshift catalog of @xcite for the xfls field to understand the redshift distribution when a flux limit of 5mjy is imposed . @xcite observed the xfls field using the hectospec instrument on mmt for 5 positions covering a 1 degree diameter field of view individually .",
    "then they combined redshifts from hectospec with redshifts from sdss , and reached a completeness of @xmath290% at f@xmath20(24@xmath0m)@xmath231mjy in the 3.3 square degrees of their survey field .",
    "these authors also provided the completeness factors at different flux limits , which we use to derive the final number counts at f@xmath20(24@xmath0m)@xmath235mjy in the xfls field .",
    "then we divide the number of objects in different redshift bins by the total number of objects in the xfls field , and derive the fractional contribution of number counts in this field at f@xmath24(24@xmath0m)@xmath235mjy . using this as a reference , we predict the number of objects in the corresponding redshift bins for the 5muses sample .",
    "then we divide the predicted number counts by the number of objects we have observed and obtain the correction factor in each redshift bin .",
    "finally , we fit a second - order polynomial to the data and this gives us the completeness correction factor @xmath27(z ) , which is then used to correct for the incompleteness at different redshifts .",
    "we limit our study of the mid - ir luminosity function to z@xmath10.3 because the rest - frame 24@xmath0 m bandm filter , instead of the monochromatic 24@xmath0 m continuum . ]",
    "moves outside the irs spectrum beyond z@xmath280.3 .",
    "in addition to that , our relatively bright flux limit of f@xmath24(24@xmath0m)@xmath235mjy results in a fast decrease of the number of objects as redshift increases , which would yield results that have low statistical significance at high redshift .    in this study , we use the 1/v@xmath14 method @xcite to derive the luminosity function , which does not require any assumption on the shape of the lf .",
    "the 1/v@xmath14 method counts galaxies within a volume .",
    "v@xmath14 is calculated individually for each source in our sample as the maximal volume within which that galaxy is detectable in this survey .",
    "the availability of 5 - 35@xmath0 m irs spectrum allows us to accurately make k - corrections based on the observed sed shape for individual galaxy .",
    "we first derive the k - correction for each object , and then move the galaxy to the redshift where its 24@xmath0 m observed flux reaches the limit of this sample , 5mjy .",
    "the maximum comoving volume is calculated as :    @xmath29    where [ z@xmath30,z@xmath31 is the redshift range of interest . for our study , we ignore sources with z@xmath10.02 , while z@xmath32 is the lower of the two : a ) the maximum redshift considered in this study , 0.3 , b ) the maximum redshift a source can be detected at the limiting observed 24@xmath0 m flux of 5mjy . the uniformity of the distribution of galaxies is tested by checking the v / v@xmath14 values and we find @xmath33=0.54 for the sources used in this study . the luminosity function",
    "is then derived by using the following formula @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the total survey area of 5muses sample ( 40.6 square degrees ) , v@xmath36 is the comoving volume over which the ith galaxy could be observed , @xmath37logl is the size of the luminosity bin and @xmath27 is the completeness correction factor for the ith galaxy .",
    "@xmath27 is a function of redshift and was calculated in section 3.1 .",
    "we divide the sources into seven luminosity bins , and calculate the value of @xmath38 in each bin .",
    "the uncertainties include both the poisson noise statistics on the number of sources used in the measurement , and the uncertainty associated with the completeness correction factor @xmath27 .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : selection ] , the uncertainty of @xmath27 is rather large , mainly due to the small number of objects in each redshift bin in xfls at f@xmath24(24@xmath0m)@xmath235mjy , so we assign an uncertainty of 40% to @xmath27 , which is the average uncertainty for the data points we use to calculate the correction factor . because our k - corrections are made directly from the source sed , we have almost negligible uncertainties associated with the conversion from the observed flux to the rest - frame luminosities . for the luminosity functions presented in this paper",
    ", we do not include noise from the cosmic variance since we sample several widely distributed directions .",
    "the mid - ir sed of star forming galaxies and agn show distinctly different spectral features . as a result ,",
    "the availability of 5 - 35@xmath0 m irs spectra for the 5muses sample allows us to disentangle the star - formation and agn contribution to the galaxy luminosity .",
    "star - forming galaxies often display broad emission features , which are generally attributed to the emission from pahs .",
    "agn , on the other hand , are usually characterized by featureless power - law continuum ( except for a few high - ionization fine - structure lines ) and their mid - to - far ir continuum slopes are normally flatter than star - forming galaxies . a combination of one starburst template and a power - law continuum with a free spectral index",
    "have often been used to decompose galaxy spectra into star - formation and agn components for high - redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "the high s / n irs data of the 5muses sample allow us to take into account detailed mid - ir features and decompose the galaxy spectra much more accurately . among mid - ir spectral features ( pah strength , continuum slopes , silicate strength , fine - structure lines , etc .",
    ") , pah strength or the ir continuum slopes are arguably the most commonly used indicators for star - formation , so we select our templates mainly based on these two parameters .",
    "we start from our empirical sed template library @xcite , which has included star - forming galaxies , ulirgs and pg/2mass quasars , and select 15 star - forming galaxy ( 6.2@xmath0 m pah ew@xmath230.5@xmath0 m ) templates and 10 quasar templates , covering as large a range of pah strength and slope variation as possible .",
    "then we perform a least-@xmath39 fit for each combination of a star - formation template and a quasar template to find the most likely coefficients that would describe the observed 5muses spectrum as a linear combination of the two templates . in the upper panels of figure [ fig : samplefit ] , we show examples of decomposition of irs spectra of typical starburst dominated , composite and agn dominated sources .    * statistical constraints on the star - formation contribution : * rather than directly adopting the star - formation fraction at 15@xmath0 m from the best - fit , we build the probability density function ( _ pdf _ ) of the star formation fraction by weighting the values of star formation fraction for each trial fit by exp(-@xmath40 )",
    ". then the star - formation fraction is taken to be the median of the resulting probability density function and the 1@xmath41 uncertainty is taken to be the 16th-84th percentile range . on the lower panels of figure [ fig : samplefit ] , we show the corresponding _ pdf _ for each source and the sf fraction and its associated uncertainties are also indicated on the plot .",
    "as discussed earlier , the 6.2@xmath0 m pah ew and the continuum slope have often been used as indicators of star - formation activities .",
    "we compare the 6.2@xmath0 m pah ew and continuum slope of f@xmath24(24@xmath0m)/f@xmath24(15@xmath0 m ) versus sf fraction estimated from the probability distribution on the left and middle panels of figure [ fig : pahslopesf ] .",
    "our median likelihood sf fraction clearly correlates with both parameters while the scatter is quite significant for intermediate values of f@xmath24(24@xmath0m)/f@xmath24(15@xmath0 m ) ratios .",
    "note however that for f@xmath24(24@xmath0m)/f@xmath24(15@xmath0m)@xmath10.3 , all but 2 sources have very low star - formation fraction , suggesting that very flat mid - ir slopes are a strong discriminator for agn .",
    "we also note that some sources , even though they have very large pah ews ( @xmath230.5@xmath0 m ) , have star - formation fractions only @xmath250.5",
    ". this could be due to the fact that we are looking at the star - formation fraction at 15@xmath0 m in this study , while the contribution to the total ir luminosity is very likely to be dominated by sf .",
    "on the other hand , we also need to point out that the sf fraction we derive has at least @xmath220% uncertainty . finally , we plot the sf fraction versus the ir luminosity for each source on the right panel of figure [ fig : pahslopesf ] and we do not observe any correlation .",
    "this indicates luminosity itself provides limited information on the energy source of a galaxy .",
    "clearly , there is no single parameter that could be used to determine the sf fraction accurately , thus a combination of a few is indeed needed in order to constrain the relative contributions of sf and agn .",
    "from the 5 - 35@xmath0 m irs spectrum of the 5muses sample , we can directly estimate the rest - frame mips - equivalent 24@xmath0 m luminosities . using the 1/v@xmath14 method ,",
    "we have derived the 24@xmath0 m luminosity function for sources with z@xmath10.3 .",
    "our 24@xmath0 m lf is shown in figure [ fig : lf24 ] and the corresponding data points are reported in table [ lffit ] .",

    "the dotted line denotes the luminosity calculated at the median redshift of our sample corresponding to the 24@xmath0 m flux limit .",
    "note that 5mjy is the flux limit on the observed 24@xmath0 m , while the flux limit we use here is taken to be the rest frame 24@xmath0 m flux density corresponding to the galaxy with f@xmath43(24@xmath0m)=5mjy and maximum k - corrected .",
    "on figure [ fig : lf24 ] , we have also included the 24@xmath0 m lfs by @xcite for comparison .",
    "our lf is in good agreement with @xcite at the low end , while at the high end , our data points are located between the 0.05@xmath1z@xmath10.2 and the 0.2@xmath1z@xmath10.35 lfs they have derived .",
    "this indicates that in the redshift range we derive our lf , evolution is probably already at work , as will be addressed in more detail later on .",
    "we then compute the rest - frame 15@xmath0 m monochromaticm . ]",
    "luminosity function for our sample .",
    "lf at this wavelength has been extensively studied in the local universe @xcite as well as at high redshift @xcite to explore the evolution of galaxy populations .",

    ", we plot our 15@xmath0 m lf with solid circles and the corresponding data points are reported in table [ lffit ] .",
    "the dotted line denotes the luminosity calculated at the median redshift of this sample corresponding to the 15@xmath0 m flux limit .",
    "as expected , the completeness level at 15@xmath0 m is much lower than at 24@xmath0 m , since this is a 24@xmath0 m selected sample at z@xmath10.3 .",
    "the dashed line is the fit to our lf with double power - law exponential function . during our fit",
    ", we fixed the faint end slope to @xmath44=1.2 , which has been well determined from similar studies in the local universe .",
    "the results of the fitting parameters are reported in table [ lfpara ] . for comparison",
    ", we also overplot the local 15@xmath0 m lf from @xcite derived using isocam observations .",
    "similar to what we have observed when we compare our 24@xmath0 m lf with @xcite , the 5muses lf is in good agreement with xu s lf at the low end , while our lf is slightly higher at the high luminosity end .",
    "this can be explained by the differential evolution effect .",
    "the density or luminosity evolution with redshift have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "evolution affects different luminosity bins by different amounts , because they are populated from different redshift ranges . in the lower panel of figure [ fig : lf15 ]",
    ", we plot the median redshift in each luminosity bin as a solid circle and the 16th and 84th percentile as the error bar .",
    "the median redshift ( z=0.09 ) for xu s sample has also been plotted ( solid line ) together with its 1@xmath41 population dispersion .",
    "although the median redshift for the sources used in this study is 0.12 , it is clear that the high luminosity end is dominated by sources at higher redshift , thus our slightly higher lf at the bright end is almost certainly a result of that difference .",
    "in addition to using the double power - law to fit the lf , we have also attempted using a single schechter function . in figure",
    "[ fig : lf15 ] , we overplot the fit with schechter function as the blue dot - dashed line . although schechter function can fit our data reasonably well , the fit is rather poor in both the faint and bright end when the data points from the iso 15@xmath0 m lf by @xcite are included .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we have shown that the 15@xmath0 m lf need to be fit with a double power - law exponential function because the bright - end slope of the lf is clearly flatter than the schechter function .",
    "this is in contrast to uv lfs , which display much steeper slopes at the high luminosity end .",
    "as both the uv and ir luminosities trace active star formation , with the ir being the reprocessed portion of the uv , one would expect similar behaviors by the lfs of uv and ir emission . using spitzer irac observations of the bootes field ,",
    "@xcite have shown that the 8@xmath0 m luminosity function of a sample of _ star - forming _ galaxies does indeed follow the shape of a schechter function .",
    "more recently , using akari data , @xcite have shown that after removing the optically identified agn , their ir lf becomes much steeper . using _ spitzer _",
    "irs spectra , @xcite have studied the 15@xmath0 m lf at z=0.7 and constrained the slope of the sf lf at the high luminosity end using a schechter function .",
    "so the flatter lfs we are deriving probably reflect agn contributions to the ir , and we will verify this hypothesis in what follows . in section 3.3 , we have shown our method of decomposing the star - formation / agn contribution from the mid - ir spectra of 5muses sources and estimated the star - formation fraction by taking the median likelihood of the probability density function .",

    "local 15@xmath0 m sf lf : * using the median estimate of the star - formation fraction for each object , we derive the 15@xmath0 m star - formation luminosity by multiplying the 15@xmath0 m monochromatic continuum luminosity by the star - formation fraction at the corresponding wavelength obtained from spectral decomposition .",
    "the resulting individual sf luminosities are then used to build the sf lf . on the left panel of figure [ fig : lf15_sf ] ,",
    "we show the 15@xmath0 m sf lf ( red squares ) at z@xmath10.3 .",
    "the black dotted line is a fit to the lf adopting the schechter function .",
    "we overplot the local 15@xmath0 m lf for normal spiral and starburst galaxies by @xcite as the blue crosses .",
    "these authors analyzed data from the elais southern fields and excluded agn in their study .",
    "their sflf appear to be in good agreement with our results .",
    "we also overplot the total 15@xmath0 m lf as the black filled circles on the left panel of figure [ fig : lf15_sf ] , and the dashed line is a fit to the total 15@xmath0 m lf with double power - law exponential function .",
    "the two lfs , the total and the star - formation lfs at 15@xmath0 m , differ significantly at l@xmath46l@xmath47 .",
    "this is presumably due to the agn contribution at high luminosities .",
    "the agn lfs display distinctly different shapes from sf lf as has been shown by @xcite , etc .",
    "when the luminosity increases , the agn contribution also increases progressively .",
    "this agn component reveals its presence in the total 15@xmath0 m lf by requiring a different slope in the fit at high luminosity . in figure",
    "[ fig : lf15_sf ] , we have overplotted the 15@xmath0 m agn lf as green diamonds and fit the data with a double power - law exponential function .",
    "clearly , the agn lf presents a much shallower slope at high luminosities .",
    "on the other hand , the 15@xmath0 m sf lf drops quickly at the bright end and it could be fit well with a schechter function .",
    "this has already been seen in the local universe for the 8@xmath0 m lf of star forming galaxies by @xcite , as well as the 15@xmath0 m agn - corrected lf at 0.6@xmath1z@xmath10.8 by @xcite .",
    "* local 24@xmath0 m sf lf : * we repeat the same steps used to derive the 15@xmath0 m sf lf at 24@xmath0 m and show the 24@xmath0 m sf lf on the right panel of figure [ fig : lf15_sf ] . again , we observe the departure of the total and sf lfs at 24@xmath0 m at the bright end and the best - fit parameters are reported in table [ lfpara ] . @xcite",
    "have identified agn from optical spectroscopy and derived 24@xmath0 m sf lf in several redshift bins .",

    "star formation and agn activities have been extensively studied across all wavelengths . despite the amount of effort to quantify the sf / agn contribution and explore its evolution with luminosity / redshift",
    ", no fair comparison can be made unless truly equivalent samples are studied . our 5muses sample , after correcting for selection effects ,",
    "essentially defines a relatively bright ir selected unbiased sample , which is critical for understanding the galaxy evolution and energy balance in a cosmological context . in this subsection",
    ", we discuss how the sf / agn fraction varies with wavelengths , luminosity and redshift .      in section 4",
    ", we have derived the 15@xmath0 m luminosity function for the entire sample at z@xmath10.3 , as well as the 15@xmath0 m star - formation luminosity function . integrating the differential lf",
    ", we estimate the luminosity density at 15@xmath0 m to be 1.5@xmath50.3@xmath4810@xmath49l@xmath50mpc@xmath51 to which the sf contribution is 9.0@xmath52.2@xmath4810@xmath52l@xmath50mpc@xmath51 .",
    "this gives a sf fraction of @xmath258@xmath519% to the integrated 15@xmath0 m luminosity density .",
    "then we extrapolate our results at 15@xmath0 m to the total ir . following the technique described in @xcite ,",
    "we convert 15@xmath0 m luminosity density to the total ir luminosity density for the agn component and the sf component separately .",
    "although the uncertainty in the sf fraction in total ir will be significantly higher because the error in converting l@xmath53 to l@xmath54 also comes into play , this is still a critical quantity to obtain , especially for studies of the distant universe , where the pah features are more difficult to measure , or the pahs in high - redshift galaxies might have different properties ( e.g. larger ews ) for similar dust mass fractions .",
    "we find that the star - formation contribution comes up to 83% of the total ir luminosity density .",
    "this is understandable as the sed of a star - forming galaxies is much steeper than agn , thus the fir emission will be dominated by sf .",
    "if we convert the ir luminosity for the star - formation component to the star - formation rate and integrate over cosmic time , we find our derived star formation rate density are consistent with the dust extinction corrected values of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we repeat the same exercise at 24@xmath0 m . integrating the 24@xmath0 m lf , we find the luminosity density at 24@xmath0 m to be 3.4@xmath51.1@xmath4810@xmath49l@xmath12mpc@xmath51 while the sf luminosity density is 2.6@xmath51.1@xmath4810@xmath55l@xmath12mpc@xmath51 .",
    "this gives a sf fraction of @xmath278@xmath542% at 24@xmath0 m , higher than the number at 15@xmath0 m , while consistent with the concept that sf becomes more dominant at longer wavelength .",
    "we again convert the integrated 24@xmath0 m luminosity to total ir luminosity density for star - forming systems and agn separately and find the star - formation fraction to increase to @xmath289% , in agreement with the estimate from 15@xmath0 m .",
    "if we take the average of the two ( 86% ) , then the sf fraction in the total ir luminosity density we have derived is higher than the study of @xcite for local ulirgs , while more consistent with @xcite .",
    "however , we need to bear in mind that both veilleux and nardini study the ulirg population , while the luminosity of our sample is mostly in the range of 10@xmath56to 10@xmath57 . recent study of @xcite derived an average agn fraction of 12% in the total ir for lirgs , consistent with our estimate .",
    "as already noted ( figure [ fig : lf15_sf ] ) , the 15@xmath0 m sf lf departs from the 15@xmath0 m lf most significantly at the bright end , and this is again observed at 24@xmath0 m .",
    "it suggests that the sf fraction is a function of luminosity @xcite . in order to quantify how this fraction varies , we plot on the left panel of figure [ fig : sf_fraction ] the sf fraction at 15 @xmath0 m versus the 15@xmath0 m luminosity .",
    "we divide our sources into several luminosity bins and estimate the contribution of sf in each luminosity bin .",
    "the error bar represents the poisson noise in each bin .",
    "we find that the sf fraction decreases as the 15@xmath0 m luminosity increases .",
    "this is expected since agn plays a more important role in the energy budget for more distant , thus more luminous sources in our sample ( see figure [ fig : sf_fraction_lir_z ] ) . on the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : sf_fraction ] , we plot the sf fraction at 24@xmath0 m versus the 24@xmath0 m luminosity .",
    "we again observe a trend of the sf fraction decreasing with larger l@xmath58 , however , the decline is much milder and the sf fraction is also higher at 24@xmath0 m as compared to the 15@xmath0 m .",
    "finally , we convert the 24@xmath0 m sf luminosity and 24@xmath0 m luminosity to l@xmath59 and l@xmath54 , and show on the left panel of figure [ fig : sf_fraction_lir_z ] , how the total ir sf fraction varies as a function of ir luminosity , while on the right panel , we display the sf fraction versus redshift .",
    "we find that the sf fraction decreases with redshift , while there is little dependence of sf fraction with l@xmath60 .",
    "the decrease of sf fraction with redshift can be understood since our sample selects a higher fraction of agn - dominated sources as redshift increases ( see also figure [ fig : z_hist ] ) .",
    "we observe a mildly decreasing , or rather flat correlation between the ir sf fraction and l@xmath54 because : 1 ) at z@xmath10.3 , the luminosity of our sources only ranges from 10@xmath61l@xmath12 to 10@xmath13l@xmath12 and the majority of the sources included in this study are sf dominated ; and 2 ) even for a source dominated by a powerful agn in the mid - ir , its fir emission could still be powered by star - formation , thus sf dominates the total ir luminosity . because of the dominant contribution of sf in the fir luminosity , we do not observe a strong dependence on l@xmath54 for the sf fraction .",
    "this suggest that the mid - ir might be a more reliable wavelength if one wants to study the sf / agn fraction .",
    "the launch of the _ herschel _ space telescope has opened a new window for observing the cold dust in the universe .",
    "data from large area _",
    "herschel _ surveys , such as _ hermes _ @xcite , will provide essential constraints on the fir emission for sources in our sample , allowing a direct decomposition of sf / agn in the total ir luminosity .",
    "future studies using 70 - 500@xmath0 m data from _ herschel _ will help to further constrain the sf fraction in the total ir luminosity density , and the associated uncertainties .      in this section ,",
    "we compare the lfs derived from the 5muses sample with relevant work at higher redshift to understand the evolution effects .",
    "the median redshift for our lf is 0.12 .",
    "when compared with 15@xmath0 m lf by @xcite from iso work , we find in general good agreement between our lf and xu s lf , while at the high luminosity end , the two lfs show some discrepancy . because of the higher median redshift of the objects in the high luminosity bin of our lf , this small discrepancy with the local lf hinted at evolution effects as a function of redshift .",
    "we then compare our work with studies at high redshift . 15 or 24@xmath0 m lfs and lfs for star - forming galaxies",
    "have been derived by several different groups @xcite .",
    "in addition to deriving the rest - frame 15@xmath0 m lf from the 5muses sample , the availability of 5@xmath6235@xmath0 m irs spectra also allowed us to decompose the star formation and agn contributions to the ir spectral energy distribution in a more precise way , and thus derive the sf lf using the sf luminosity in each object from our sample .",
    "the most relevant work at higher redshift is at z=0.7 by @xcite .",
    "these authors use the irs spectra of a z=0.7 sample to estimate the sf and agn contribution to lf . in figure",
    "[ fig : lf_15_highz ] , we compare the 15@xmath0 m sf lf ( red diamonds ) from 5muses with the corresponding 15@xmath0 m sf lf at z=0.7 by @xcite ( blue squares ) . on the same figure",
    ", we also overplot the total 15@xmath0 m lf derived from 5muses sample ( black filled circles ) and its counterpart at z=0.7 from the work of @xcite ( yellow crosses ) .",
    "we observe strong evolution effects in both the total and the sf lfs . with data only in two redshift bins ( z=0.12 and z=0.7 ) , we were not able to place stringent constraints on the amount of evolution on density ( @xmath63 ) and luminosity ( @xmath64 )",
    ", however , if we adopt the values proposed by @xcite and evolve our total 15@xmath0 m lf at z=0.12 to z=0.7 by a factor of @xmath63=2.1 and @xmath65=2.6 , we find a good match between the evolved lf ( black dotted line ) and the observed data ( yellow crosses ) .",
    "we follow a similar approach to evolve the 15@xmath0 m sflf from z=0.12 to z=0.7 . in figure",
    "[ fig : sflf_evolve ] , we show that if we evolve our 15@xmath0 m sfl f at z=0.12 ( black solid line ) by a factor of @xmath63=2.5 and @xmath64=2.6 , it matches very well ( reduced @xmath66 ) with observed rest - frame 15@xmath0 m sf lf at z=0.7 from @xcite s work ( blue dashed line ) .",
    "could a pure density evolution or luminosity evolution explain the difference we observe in the sflf at z=0.12 and z=0.7 ?",
    "in figure [ fig : sflf_evolve ] , we show the best fit to the sf lf at z=0.7 if we only allow density evolution on our local sflf ( green dash - dot - dot line ) . the best fit returns @xmath63=5.3 and the reduced @xmath39=65.6 .",
    "on the same figure , we also show the best fit when only luminosity evolution is allowed ( yellow dotted line ) .",
    "we find @xmath64=4.3 and the reduced @xmath39=70.0 .",
    "even though we only have data in two redshift bins , which makes it difficult to place stringent constraints on the amount of evolution we require on luminosity and density , we can at least confirm from our work that neither pure luminosity nor pure density evolution is sufficient to explain the difference between sf lfs at z=0.12 and z=0.7 .",
    "we should however point out some caveats .",
    "although both our work and @xcite s work used irs spectra as diagnostic tools for distinguishing sf and agn , our lf is derived by separating the energy density contribution in each source , while they use irs spectra to determine the major source of energy in each object , and then remove the agn dominated sources when building their sflf . because they only have irs spectra for @xmath2 40 galaxies from their flux limited sample , the low end of their sflf is obtained by shifting the mips 24@xmath0 m luminosity to rest - frame 15@xmath0 m ( z=0.7 ) , and they assign these low luminosity objects as dominated by star formation .",
    "given our very rigorous analysis , we clearly see some differences in the total lf and the sflf at 15@xmath0 m even at the low luminosity end ( see the comparison of the black dot - dashed line and the black solid line ) , thus @xcite might have overestimated the sflf below l@xmath67=10@xmath68l@xmath12 .",
    "we have analyzed a spitzer spectroscopic sample of 24@xmath0 m selected objects in the swire and xfls fields to derive the 15 and 24@xmath0 m luminosity functions at 0@xmath1z@xmath10.3 .",
    "when combined with local and high - redshift studies , this provides critical information on understanding the evolution of energy budgets over the past three billion years ( z@xmath10.3 ) .",
    "our conclusions are summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "we have derived 24 and 15@xmath0 m lfs for our sample at z@xmath10.3 .",
    "the availability of the 5 - 35@xmath0 m allows us to make k - corrections directly using the observed sed .",
    "the 24 and 15@xmath0 m lfs display rather shallow slopes at the bright end , which is due to the increase of agn contribution in more luminous systems .",
    "\\2 . using the 5 - 35@xmath0 m irs spectra ,",
    "we have decomposed the 5muses objects into star - formation and agn components .",
    "the sf fraction is taken to be the median likelihood of the probability density function .",
    "we calculate the 15 and 24@xmath0 m sf luminosities in each object , and subsequently build the sf lfs .",
    "the sf lfs can be described with a schechter function .",
    "we have also estimated the sf contribution to the integrated 15 and 24@xmath0 m luminosity density for our sample .",
    "the sf fraction is found to be 58% at 15@xmath0 m and it goes up to 78% at 24@xmath0 m . using the conversion factor from l@xmath69 to l@xmath54 for star - forming galaxies and agns respectively , we found the sf fraction to be @xmath286% in the total ir luminosity density .",
    "the sf fraction is also found to be a function of luminosity / redshift , decreasing as luminosity or redshift increase , while the trend is more obvious in mid - ir , suggesting that mid - ir wavelength is more sensitive to the presence of agn .",

    "<S> when we remove the contribution of agn , the bright end of the luminosity function exhibits a strong decline , consistent with the exponential cutoff of a schechter function . integrating the differential luminosity function , we find that the fractional contribution by star formation to the energy density is 58% at 15@xmath0 m and 78% at 24@xmath0 m , while it goes up to @xmath286% when we extrapolate our mid - ir results to the total ir luminosity density . </S>",
