    "a binary star is a system of two stars and they orbit around their common centre of mass ( walter , 1940 ; kuiper , 1941 ) .",
    "in fact , at least @xmath0 of the stars are found to be in binary systems ( abt , 1983 ; pinfield et al . ,",
    "the orbital periods ( porb ) of binary stars range from 11 minutes to  @xmath1 years .",
    "( podsiadlowski , 2001 ) . in a binary star",
    "roche lobe plays a very major role .",
    "it actually coins the specific region about a component star in a binary system within which the orbiting material remains gravitationally bound with respect to that star ( herbig , 1957 ; plavec , 1966 ) .",
    "detached binaries are binary stars where each component is within its roche lobe and neither star fills its roche lobe .",
    "mass transfers are unlikely for this category of binaries . in case of semi - detached binaries ( kopal , 1955 )",
    "one of the components fills the roche lobe but the other does not . in",
    "case of a contact binary ( kopal , 1955 ) both the components fill their roche lobes .    in case of semi - detached and contact binaries ,",
    "mass transfer is quite expected .",
    "in fact , the majority of binaries are in fairly wide systems that do not interact strongly and both the stars evolve essentially as single star .",
    "but there is a large fraction of systems ( for porb at the left hand neighbourhood of 10 years ) that are close enough ( podsiadlowski , 2001 ) that mass is transferred from one star to another which changes the structures of both the stars and their subsequent evolution .",
    "they are termed as close binaries .",
    "although the exact numbers are somewhat uncertain , binary surveys suggest that the close binaries range between @xmath2 to @xmath0 ( duquennoy and mayor , 1991 ; kobulnicky and fryer , 2007 ) of the total binary population .    crawford ( 1955 ) and hoyle ( 1955 ) independently proposed that the observed secondaries are originally the more massive stars . at the primary level both the companions in a binary evolve independently .",
    "but as the donor expands beyond its roche lobe , then the material can escape the gravitational pull of the star and eventually the process of mass transfer starts from donor to gainer .",
    "the material will fall in through the inner lagrangian point .",
    "normally there are two possible mechanisms for mass transfer between stars in a close binary system .",
    "the first one is conservative mass transfer in which both the total mass and angular momentum of the binary are conserved and the second one is non - conservative mass transfer where both the total mass and angular momentum decays with time .",
    "observationally , there are evidences for both conservative and non conservative mass transfer in close binaries ( podsiadlowski , 2001 ; yakut , 2006 ; manzoori , 2011 ; pols , 2012 ) .",
    "the modelling of non - conservative mass transfer is a challenging one as in this case governing mechanism becomes very much complicated and uncertain due to the loss of the mass as well as the angular momentum in the binary .",
    "mass transfer in close binaries is often non - conservative and the ejected material moves slowly enough that it can remain available for subsequent star formation ( izzard et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "some communications are available which have tried to address some issues in the non - conservative mass transfer . packet ( 1981 ) proposed that accretion and spin up continues until the mass of the gainer increases by about @xmath3 at which point it rotates so fast that material at its equator is unbounded .",
    "rappaport et al .",
    "( 1983 ) and stepien ( 1995 ) calculated the relative angular momentum lost from the system for a non - conservative mass transfer with uniform accretion rate .",
    "soberman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) discussed on different types of modes of mass transfer like roche lobe overflow , jeans mode and produced detailed description of orbital evolution for non - conservative mass transfer for different modes as well as for a combination of several modes .",
    "podsiadlowski ( 2001 ) discussed briefly the magnetic braking for non - conservative mass transfer in a binary system . .",
    "interestingly , nelson and eggleton ( 2001 ) made a survey of case a ( with short initial orbital periods ) binary evolution with comparison to observed algol - type systems under the assumption of conservative mass transfer .",
    "they arrived at the conclusion that this simplified assumption has much less acceptability in view of the real observation and they pointed out the consideration of loss of mass and angular momentum in order to understand the dynamics more precisely .",
    "sepinsky et al .",
    "( 2006 ) discussed the mass loss in the non - conservative mass transfer and loss of angular momentum in eccentric binaries .",
    "van rensbergen et al . (",
    "2010 ) discussed on the mass loss out of close binaries .",
    "manzoori ( 2011 ) sketched the effects of magnetic fields on the mass loss and mass transfer for non - conservative mass exchange with uniform rate of accretion by the gainer .",
    "davis et al .",
    "( 2013 ) demonstrated mass transfer in eccentric binary systems using binary evolution code .",
    "interestingly , the above works mainly dealt with uniform mass accretion rate by the gainer .",
    "but real situations may not always play by this simple rule . in this regard",
    "we must mention that stepien and kiraga ( 2013 ) while detailing on the evolutionary process under the non - conservative mass transfer in close binary system argued for non - uniform rate of mass accretion with respect to time .    in the present work we have tried to introduce a new mathematical model for the non - conservative mass transfer in the close binary which can address the issues like the mode of mass transfer and mass loss under the consideration of the critical mass limit ( for the gainer ) ( packet , 1981 ) of the transfer when the gainer is spun up through an accretion disk .",
    "the present model has be en prescribed taking in to account the gradually decreasing profile of the mass accretion rate by the gainer star with respect to time as well as with respect to the increase in mass of the gainer star and consequent time dependent mass profiles of the component stars and the orbital angular momentum of the close binary system have been demonstrated .",
    "we have also provided a numerical model in view of our present consideration .",
    "we first assume that @xmath4 is the mass of the gainer star and @xmath5 is the mass of the donor star at time t. initially @xmath6 i.e. greater mass is discharging mass and lower mass is in taking mass .",
    "we here consider that the process of this mass exchange continues within the range @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is supposed to be the critical mass of the gainer beyond which the process completely stops .",
    "this assumption is made following the argument made by packet ( 1981 ) that the process of mass transfer continues till the gainer gets @xmath3 increase in its weight when the gainer is spun up through an accretion disk as beyond this the accretor rotates so fast that material at the equator gets unbounded .",
    "we consider the following model of non - conservative mass transfer :    @xmath9    @xmath10    it is to be noted that there already exists a conventional model of non - conservative mass transfer in close binaries ( podsiadlowski et al . , ( 1992 ) ; sepinsky et al . , ( 2006 ) ; van rensbergen et al . , (",
    "2010 ) ; davis et al . , ( 2013 ) ) assuming the mass exchange rate to be uniform with respect to time and the proposed model in this context was @xmath11 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 carry the same meaning as in ( 1 ) .",
    "later stepien and kiraga ( 2013 ) showed that for non - conservative mass transfer this mass exchange rate decreases gradually with time and also according to izzard et al .",
    "( 2013 ) this mass exchange rate is very slow and decreases as the gainer captures mass . in view of this",
    "we introduced two factors in the above model given in ( 1 ) : the first factor @xmath12 is to trace the gradually decreasing profile of mass exchange rate with time and in this connection the parameter @xmath13 must be small enough so that this rate of exchange remains feeble altogether .",
    "the second factor @xmath14 is to capture the gradually decreasing profile of this exchange rate with the increase in @xmath4 within the limit @xmath7 as mentioned earlier . here",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is dimensionless but the parameter @xmath16 has the unit per unit time.    now applying bernoulli s law to the gas flow through the inner lagrangian point , we get    @xmath17    where a is a numerical constant likely to be between 1 and 2 .",
    "since , @xmath18 ( pols , 2012 ) where @xmath19 is the total timescale of mass transfer and p is is the orbital time period we therefore have ,    @xmath20    for stars with convective envelops , i.e. for red - giants or low - mass main sequence stars , @xmath21 and this gives us from ( 3 ) ,    @xmath22    using ( 4 ) in ( 1 ) ,    @xmath23    we consider that at t=0 ( when this mass exchange started ) the initial masses of gainer and donor were @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "as @xmath19 is taken to be the total time scale of mass transfer we can believe that @xmath19 is the hypothetical time taken by the gainer to reach the mass @xmath8 starting from @xmath24 , provided there is no reverse mass transfer or any other issue preventing this mass exchange .    on integration ,",
    "( 4 ) gives ,    @xmath26    this gives ,    @xmath27    again integrating ( 5 ) we get ,    @xmath28    using ( 6 ) in ( 8) ,    @xmath29    this gives      for   @xmath31 + now as the process of mass transfer continues till the gainer gets @xmath3 increase in its weight when the gainer is spun up through accretion disk ( packet , 1981 ) we have ,    @xmath32    thus from ( 10 ) we get , @xmath33,\\ ] ] for @xmath34    we expect that at @xmath35 , @xmath36 appreciably nears to the critical value @xmath37 and this suggests us to take @xmath38 at the right hand neighbourhood of zero .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath15 must assume their magnitudes in accordance with this .    as we know that in non - conservative mass transfer , less than @xmath39 of the mass ejected from the donor reaches the gainer i.e. as the accretion efficiency is less than about 0.25 ( de mink et al . , 2009 )",
    "we have @xmath40 , @xmath41 this gives ,    @xmath42\\ ] ] now , @xmath43\\ ] ] is an increasing function of t. hence minimum of this function occurs at t=0 .",
    "this gives , @xmath44=\\frac{11}{4 } ~~[~using~(11 ) ~]\\ ] ]    we have , @xmath45 ( pols , 2012 ) where @xmath46 , r being the radius of the donor and @xmath47 being the roche lobe radius .",
    "we also have @xmath48 ( pols , 2012 ) .",
    "so we can take , @xmath49    the orbital period should be less than 100 days so that the star can fill its roche lobe during its expansion through main sequence phase till to a red giant ( monzoori , 2011 ) .",
    "this gives us @xmath50 ( days ) and from ( 14 ) we can consider @xmath51 days i.e. @xmath52 years . on the other hand , we have @xmath53 years ( postonov and yungelson , 2014 ) .",
    "this gives finally ,    @xmath54    as a is expected to lie in the range between 1 and 2 and further @xmath55 , the expression @xmath56 is expected to be in the range of order between 1 and @xmath57 depending on the ratio @xmath58 .",
    "thus in order to bring the expression @xmath59 at the vicinity of zero as argued previously we must take @xmath60 in the order of 10 which gives also , @xmath61 as a is expected to be in the range between 1 and 2 .",
    "this gives ,    @xmath62\\ ] ]    the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of a circularized close binary system at time t is given by , ( demircan et al .",
    ", 2006 )    @xmath63    where , @xmath64 is the total mass of the system at time t , a is the separation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and g is the gravitational constant .",
    "( 17 ) can be written as    @xmath65    where @xmath66 @xmath67 being the binary angular velocity .",
    "we have from ( 18 ) ,    @xmath68    where the orbital period is @xmath69    from ( 20 ) combining the results of ( 6 ) and ( 12 ) , we can obtain the time dependent profile of the orbital angular momentum j. however rappaport et al .",
    "( 1983 ) worked in the framework of non - conservative mass transfer with uniform exchange rate to estimate the amount of orbital angular momentum that is lost by the binary system on the basis of the understanding that the angular momentum lost for the system is equivalent to the angular momentum of the lost mass at any instant .",
    "but that might not work consistently in the long run .",
    "so taking in to account the non - conservative mass transfer with non - uniform accretion rate we prefer to furnish the above time dependent model of orbital angular momentum directly as an explicit function of the changing masses of both gainer and donor star during the process of non - conservative mass transfer .",
    "we here produce a numerical example for the non - conservative mass transfer in close binary system taking the initial masses of the gainer and donor as @xmath70(gm ) and @xmath71 ( gm ) . for the present calculation",
    ", we consider the values of the parameters as @xmath72 ( per year ) and @xmath73 .",
    "the profiles of the change in masses for both gainer and donor as well as the changing profile of the orbital angular velocity with time are observed within the pre - assigned time scale of mass exchange as @xmath74 ( years ) and orbital period p=90 ( days ) . in this regard the graphs for @xmath75 against t ( fig .",
    "1 ) , @xmath76 against t ( fig .",
    "2 ) and j against t ( fig .",
    "3 ) are demonstrated to visualize this changing profile in the binary .",
    "interestingly in the present calculation we can observe some increase in the magnitude of j at the very initial phase ( around up to 3000 years ) .",
    "but after that phase we can see a steady decrease in j ( see fig .",
    "this might have occurred due to the reason that at the initial level @xmath4 increases sharply while @xmath5 experiences steady decrease .",
    "this altogether may have generated this kind of convex shape in the graph of j at the initial phase .",
    "but afterwards as the mass accretion rate by the gainer varies slowly and consequently @xmath4 shows a very weak variation with time , j continues to show a steady decreasing profile with the decrease in @xmath5 [ in view of ( 20 ) ] .",
    "in this paper we have made an effort to establish a mathematical model of non - conservative mass transfer in close binary systems which can address the gradually reducing rate of the mass accretion by the gainer from the donor with respect to time ( stepien and kiraga , 2013 ) as well as with respect to the increase in mass of the gainer ( izzard et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "in the present model we have taken in to account a critical mass limit of the gainer for this mass exchange ( packet , 1981 ) beyond which this process may not be continued . in view of this we have presented the time dependent profiles of the masses of both the component stars in a close binary as well as of the orbital angular momentum of the corresponding binary system .",
    "we have presented a numerical example in this regard to demonstrate the changing profiles of masses of the component stars in a close binary as well as the orbital angular momentum of the system .",
    "however the formula of packet ( 1981 ) used in the present model is valid when the gainer is spun up through an accretion disk .",
    "when the gainer is spun up through direct impact this formula may not be appropriate . in those situations",
    "the spin up of the gainer can be modulated by tidal interactions .",
    "hence in the process the gainer can accrete much more than @xmath3 of its mass without rotating at critical velocity for a long period of time .",
    "we will work in future in this direction to understand the critical limit of mass accretion under the consideration that the gainer is spun up through direct impact .",
    "magnetic field can play a significant role in this mass transfer and mass loss for some close binary systems ( podsiadlowski , 2001 ; manzoori , 2011 ) .",
    "this can be an interesting future study to incorporate the effect of the magnetic field in the present model .",
    "on the other hand there have been claims on the possibility of reverse mass transfer in binary systems ( crawford , 1955 ; hoyle , 1955 ; nelson and eggleton , 2001 ; stepien and kiraga , 2013 ) .",
    "mass loss is also common in the process of single star evolution .",
    "so for a component star in a binary system mass loss may occur both for its single star evolutionary process as well as for binary star evolution . it can be critical study in this context to separate these two issues for better understanding .",
    "there is also a suggestion to include the effect of neutrino emission according to the photon - neutrino coupling theory for better understanding of the evolution of binary systems ( raychaudhuri , 2013 ) .",
    "future study in this context may focus also on these issues .",
