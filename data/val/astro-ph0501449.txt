    "the fraction of molecular material at high temperatures ( @xmath0  k ) indicates the amount of molecular gas either currently participating in star formation or experiencing its immediate after effects such as shocks ( e.g. scoville et al .",
    "1982 ; shull & beckwith 1982 ) .",
    "a useful probe of molecular gas at high excitation is the ro - vibrational  2.122  line .",
    "2.122  emission derives from collisional excitation by shocks or radiative excitation in ultraviolet radiation fields ( e.g. goldader et al .",

    "the data obtained for the key project sample include mid - infrared imaging and spectrophotometry , far - infrared spectroscopy , and  imaging . as a follow - up to the key project we have recently obtained 57@xmath610  2.122  spectral data cubes and arcminutes - scale  datasets for six galaxies .",

    "observations were obtained over the period 2003 february through 2003 october .",
    "the array of six 10.4  m telescopes was used in its `` compact '' configuration for observing one track each for ngc  2388 and ngc  7771 ; ngc  4418 was observed in the `` low '' and `` equatorial '' arrangements for one track apiece .",
    "the average single - sideband temperature ranged from 304 to 378  k for the set of four tracks .",
    "spectral resolution was provided by a digital correlator configured with four bands , each with @xmath7  mhz channels , yielding a total velocity coverage @xmath8  at the redshifted  line .",
    "nearby radio - loud qsos were used for gain and passband calibration .",
    "the data were calibrated using the standard owens valley array mma program ( scoville et al .",
    "1993 ) and mapped using the bima miriad package ( sault , teuben , & wright 1995 ) .",
    "the beam sizes for the different observations are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] along with the rms noise level in the source - free channels of the cleaned maps .",
    "the planets uranus and neptune were used as flux calibrators ; the absolute  fluxes are uncertain at the 20% level .",

    "the  emission for ugc  2855 follows the spiral arm and bar patterns seen in .",
    "the molecular bar is @xmath98  kpc long . as described in httemeister , aalto , & wall ( 1999 ) , the radio continuum and  both peak within an arcsecond of 03@xmath1048@xmath1120.8@xmath12@xmath1370@xmath140758 .",

    "the apparent linear cutoff along the northern edge is an artifact of the  map obtained by httemeister , aalto , & wall .",
    "taylor et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have previously compared  emission with  for ngc  1569 .",
    "we have obtained  data for  region 2 of waller ( 1991 ) , which also overlaps with region c of greve et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and gmc 3 of taylor et al .",
    "neither of the super starclusters for which ngc  1569 is famous is covered by the  map , though super starcluster a is near the eastern edge of the  map .",
    "the  image exhibits fairly striking features due to the winds from the starclusters .",
    "the  emission is strongest in the southwestern quadrant of the region mapped in  ( dale et al .",
    "2004 ) , a region that also shows significant  emission .",
    "sheth et al . (",
    "2002 ) have previously compared the  emission with  for ngc  6946 .",
    "the  emission in the center of ngc  6946 displays a north - south structure and generally follows what is seen at , though as pointed out by sheth and collaborators , the  emission appears on the leading side of the  emission .",
    "the linear structure to the  emission for ngc  7771 follows the general inclined - disk trend evidenced by  ( and broadband optical and infrared images ) . as for ugc  2855 ,",
    "the molecular disk is asymmetric with the northeastern side of the nucleus 50% stronger in  emission than the southwestern .",
    "curiously , the molecular disk emission in the northeast is aligned with the  emission whereas the two distributions are largely misaligned for the southwestern portion of the disk .",
    "the  morphology essentially follows that at 7  ( dale et al .",
    "2000 ) , so the northeast - southwest differences can not be explained by dust extinction .",
    "the  fluxes integrated over the interferometer maps are listed in table  [ tab : fluxes ] along with fluxes extracted over the field - of - view of the palomar integral field spectrometer  pointings.30% larger than the pifs fields - of - view for ngc  2388 and ngc  7771 . ] in comparison with the global fluxes obtained from single - dish observations that are listed in the rightmost column of table  [ tab : fluxes ] , the integrated fluxes from the arrays are systematically lower .",
    "part of this discrepancy can be attributed to the relatively small  map sizes ( for ngc  6946 and ugc  2855 ) .",
    "some of the extended flux is also missed by the limited @xmath15 coverage inherent to interferometric measurements ; the minimum dish spacing of the ovro `` compact '' configuration , for example , resolves out structures larger than @xmath16  ( see helfer et al . 2003 ) .",
    "detailed investigative work by helfer et al .",
    "shows that , on 10  scales , interferometers capture 80 - 90% of the total emission .",
    "the recovery fraction approaches 100% on these scales if the co is dominated by a central concentration , similar to the situation for all our targets save for ngc  1569 .",
    "rigopoulou et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find that the percentage of `` warm '' molecular gas as traced by mid - infrared  rotational lines ( @xmath17  k ) , with respect to the bulk of the molecular gas that is `` cold '' and traced by the millimeter  transition , is 1 - 10% by mass for starbursts , and 2 - 35% for seyferts .",
    "the  mass at even higher temperatures ( @xmath0  k ) can be computed from the extinction - corrected 2.122  ro - vibrational  near - infrared line flux : m(h_2)_warm = 2 m_p n_h_2 v_h_2 = 2 m_p f_=10s(1 ) 4d^2 f_v=1,j=3 a_=10s(1 ) h 5.08  m_(f_=10s(1 ) ^-2 ) ( d ) ^2 where we assume the orion vibrational temperature @xmath18  k and thus a population fraction @xmath19 ( scoville et al .",
    "1982 ) , and a 1@xmath200  s(1 ) transition rate of @xmath21@xmath22  s@xmath23 ( turner , kirby - docken , & dalgarno 1977 ) .",
    "the `` cold '' molecular hydrogen mass can be inferred from the integrated  flux according to m(h_2)_cold 1.18 10 ^ 4  m_(s_^12co(10 ) ) ( d ) ^2 ( _ g ) where @xmath24 is the galactic -to-  conversion factor ( wilson 1995 ) .",
    "the warm / cold  mass ratios range between 10@xmath25 to 10@xmath26 for the small fields mapped in  2.122 .",
    "the luminous infrared galaxy ngc  6240 has the largest known  2.122  line luminosity , and the largest ratio of  line - to - bolometric luminosity ratio ( @xmath27 , which is 0.3% of the bolometric luminosity ; see draine & woods 1990 ) .",
    "the upper end of the range we find for our sample s _ local _ warm / cold molecular mass ratio ( 10@xmath25 to 10@xmath26 ) is consistent with the value for ngc  6240 ( van der werf et al .",
    "1993 ; young et al .",
    "1995 ) . to expand upon our result and",
    "place it within a larger context , we have extracted a large pool of  2.122  and  data from the literature .",
    "a large , uniform database of global  fluxes for nearby galaxies is provided by young et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "2.122  data for at least 32 of these galaxies can be found in the literature , and for those galaxies with multiple measurements we use the fluxes from the largest apertures ( hall et al .",
    "1981 ; rieke et al .",
    "1985 ; heckman et al . 1986 ; kawara et al . 1987 ; fischer et al .",
    "1987 ; moorwood & oliva 1988 ; puxley et al . 1988 ; lester et al . 1990 ; forbes et al . 1993 ; van der werf et al . 1993 ; calzetti 1997 ; larkin et al .",
    "1998 ; roussel et al . 2003 ) . since the  2.122  maps from the literature typically do not span areas as large as those covered by the young et al .",
    "co maps , we have estimated the portion of the co flux that derives from within the  2.122  apertures .",
    "we use an exponential model for the co emission along with the scalelengths and effective co radii suggested in young et al .",
    "the data are plotted in figure  [ fig : ratios ] as a function of global  far - infrared color .",
    "the data are corrected for galactic extinction and a uniform @xmath28 is assumed .",
    "the range in `` global '' warm / cold  mass ratio drawn from the literature spans a slightly larger range , extending down to 10@xmath29 .",
    "in addition , the mass ratio tracks the far - infrared color .",
    "note also that the trend holds regardless of nuclear activity .",
    "correcting for internal extinction would likely steepen the slope of the trend , as sources with warmer far - infrared colors typically exhibit larger extinctions ( e.g. hattori et al .",
    "however , compared to the @xmath30  mag typically found for starburst nuclei ( ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997 ; dale et al .",
    "2004 ) , the reddening vector displayed in figure  [ fig : ratios ] shows that a large internal extinction is necessary to significantly shift the data points .",
    "another caveat is that the co - to-  conversion factor is likely to differ from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "some authors suggest the co - to-  conversion factor clearly depends on metallicity ( e.g. wilson 1995 ; arimoto , sofue , tsujimoto et al .",
    "1996 ; israel 1997 ) whereas others claim negligible variation above a metallicity of 12+log[o / h]@xmath98.0 ( e.g. rosolowsky et al . 2003 ; bolatto et al .",
    "metallicities were found for half of the galaxies in the literature , and using the co - to-  prescription described in ( wilson 1995 ) we find only a 10% increase ( 0.04 dex ) in the average warm / cold ratio . if internal extinction and the co - to-  conversion factor @xmath31 were properly gauged for each galaxy the data points would differ , but it is unlikely that the main trend would be washed out .",
    "it is worth questioning whether this trend with  is just a global effect : are the variations from the overall trend more significant on a local scale ? does the observed trend simply reflect smoothing on a global scale of more variable local phenomena ?",
    "the  interferometric maps allow us to sample the cold molecular hydrogen on a scale more similar to the typical extent of the  2.122  emission .",
    "the local far - infrared colors are estimated using  from the higher resolution  mid - infrared imaging data and the -to-  mapping for star - forming galaxies ( dale et al .",
    "2001 ; dale & helou 2002 ) .",
    "the small data points displayed in figure  [ fig : ratios ] represent the `` local '' ratios for the six galaxies in table  [ tab : obs]these data stem from just the palomar integral field spectrometer  fields - of - view . except for ngc  4418 , which is listed as a seyfert  2 galaxy in ned ,",
    "the local ratios are indicated by stars to indicate that they derive from star - forming regions .",
    "the data for these six small - scale ( sub - kpc to kpc ) regions are consistent with the galaxy global data .",
    "the relation may break down on the parsec or tens of parsec scale ( e.g. scoville et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , where the mass ratio is 10@xmath32 for the core of the orion molecular cloud ) , but higher resolution data would be required to probe to this level in extragalactic regions .",
    "the gas mass ratio gauges the molecular gas phase of the interstellar medium whereas the far - infrared color is a probe of the dust emission .",
    "the two measures are coupled , likely due to the effects of star formation on the interstellar medium .",
    "the warm / cold molecular gas mass ratio is a measure of star formation activity via shocks and perhaps uv excitation ( draine & woods 1990 ; van der werf et al .",
    "1993 ) , while the far - infrared color is a measure of star formation activity via dust grain temperature ( hattori et al . 2004 ; xilouris et al . 2004 ; dale et al . in preparation ) . in either case , the same stars are ultimately responsible for heating the warm molecular gas and interstellar dust .",
    "a locally - based coupling could arise from molecule formation on dust or molecular gas excitation via the photoelectric effect from grains . on the other hand , a more global description would simply link radiation leaking out from a younger stellar population embedded within or near a molecular cloud complex and heating interstellar dust distributed on kpc scales .",
    "the photoelectric basis for local coupling is unlikely since photoelectrons primarily arise from the smallest grains , whereas the far - infrared color is dominated by emission from large grains ( e.g. hollenbach & tielens 1999 ) .",
    "moreover , the far - infrared color is more of a large - scale measure since it reflects the balance of emission from diffuse cirrus and /photodissociation regions ( e.g. helou 1986 ) .",
    "in other words , a global scaling is likely .",
    "we have obtained near - infrared  and interferometric  maps for six nearby galaxies , data that trace different phases of interstellar molecular gas .",
    "we find that the mass ratio of warm and cold molecular gas is of order @xmath22 to @xmath33 , indicative of the amount of molecular material that is experiencing the effects of active star formation . after supplementing these sub - kpc to kpc scale data with integrated ( global ) data from the literature",
    ", we find a broad trend between the molecular gas mass ratio and the far - infrared color .",
    "both ratios are conceptually linked to star formation , though it is unlikely that they are directly physically coupled .",
    "it is more likely that the link relates to radiation emerging from young stars within or near molecular clouds and heating dust grains distributed on kpc scales .",
