    "the resulting charged boson can then condense leading to superconductivity@xcite . remarkably , the superconductor so obtained is in the same phase@xcite as a bcs superconductor obtained by condensing cooper pairs . in other words , both routes to superconductivity lead to the same final destination . in conventional metals ,",
    "the occurence of superconductivity is attributed to the presence of cooper pairing of the landau quasiparticles of the normal fermi liquid state due to attractive interactions arising from phonons . in the cuprate high-@xmath1 superconductors , on the other hand",
    ", it may well be that the superconductivity occurs via the splintering of the electron .",
    "some evidence for this is provided by angle - resolved photoemission experiments@xcite which do not see any evidence for landau quasiparticles in the normal state .",
    "the quantization of electromagnetic flux in units of @xmath2 is usually taken as evidence of the presence of cooper pairing in superconductors .",
    "however , in the  non - pairing \" fractionalization route to superconductivity - which is driven by the condensation of a charge @xmath0 chargon - @xmath2 flux quantization is nevertheless possible due to the presence of topological `` vortex - like '' excitations@xcite in the normal state - dubbed the visons .",
    "indeed , the existence of visons as gapped excitations is crucial@xcite for the electron to be able to fractionalize at all .",
    "recently , we proposed an experiment@xcite that could directly detect the visons in the normal state thereby providing a direct test of the idea that the electron fractionalizes in the cuprates .    in this paper ,",
    "we propose several other tests of the idea that the electron is fractionalized in the non - superconducting state .",

    "in contrast to this classic effect , we argue that if the insulator in the junction is fractionalized , there will in addition be oscillations at a frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the ratio of the amplitudes of the oscillations at the two different frequencies depends on the charge gap and the vison gap in the fractionalized insulator .",
    "a good candidate to maximize the amplitude of the @xmath8 oscillation is the _ undoped _ cuprate insulator .",
    "the undoped cuprates are antiferromagnetic mott insulators .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref .",

    "observation of @xmath8 oscillations will establish experimentally the fractionalization of the electron in the undoped cuprate .    in recent years",
    ", a number of experiments@xcite probing tunneling into small grains of conventional low-@xmath1 materials have shown an `` even - odd '' effect : the tunneling conductance has a periodic sequence of peaks as a function of the total charge on the grain .",
    "the period is _ twice _ the electron charge - this can be interpreted as due to cooper pairing of electrons in the superconductor .",
    "we argue that this result will be modified if the insulating barrier in the tunnel junction is fractionalized .",
    "specifically , we consider the situation where the tunneling occurs from superconducting leads through an insulating tunnel barrier to a small superconducting grain .",
    "if the insulator is fractionalized , it becomes possible for chargons to tunnel through .",
    "consequently , the tunneling conductance would have a periodic sequence of peaks with period set by @xmath0 rather than @xmath6 .",
    "another test of the fractionalization scenario for the underdoped cuprates was pointed out a long time ago by sachdev , nagaosa , and lee@xcite .",
    "they observed that a superconductor that descends from a fractionalized insulator has regimes in which the energy cost of an @xmath9 vortex is smaller than two isolated @xmath2 vortices .",
    "thus observation of stable @xmath9 vortices in the superconducting phase would be an indirect test of the fractionalization in the  normal \" state . here",
    ", following their ideas , and using currently available data , we provide a rough estimate of the region of stability of the @xmath9 vortex .",
    "we begin by very briefly reviewing the theory of the fractionalized insulator .",

    "this is significant .",

    "observation of such @xmath8 oscillations in the ac josephson effect will prove that the undoped cuprate is fractionalized ( despite it s neel long range order ) .",
    "in passing , we note that even in the conventional ac josephson effect as probed by the shapiro steps in an irradiated junction , for instance , subharmonic oscillations at frequency @xmath67 with integer @xmath68 are present@xcite .",
    "these occur due to the possibility of absorption of @xmath68 photons by the tunneling cooper pairs .",
    "however , for small intensity of the radiation , the amplitude for the processes with @xmath69 is substantially smaller than for @xmath70 .",
    "we may then safely ignore the possibility of multi - photon absorption .",
    "as the intensity of the radiation is increased on the fractionalized junction , multi - photon absorption should also become possible leading to subharmonic oscillations at frequencies @xmath71 .",
    "it is important to note that our result does _ not _ depend on the  pairing \" symmetry of the superconductor . in particular",
    ", the two superconductors could be conventional low-@xmath1 @xmath72-wave materials ( see fig .",
    "[ ivsist ] ) .",
    "this perhaps surprising fact further emphasizes our point that cooper pair condensation and chargon condensation lead to the same superconducting phase .",
    "the charge has no integrity as a good quantum number inside the superconducting state .",
    "thus it is possible to halve the ac josephson frequency to @xmath8 by making an insulating barrier in which the chargons can freely propagate .",
    "these general points are further illustrated by considering an insulating barrier made of a conventional material in which the electron is _ not _ fractionalized .",
    "now chargons can no longer propagate coherently from one superconductor to the other .",
    "however , the cooper pair tunneling can proceed as before .",
    "formally , this may be seen in the @xmath10 formulation by noticing that the non - fractionalized phases are obtained when @xmath73 . in this case , the operator @xmath45 will fluctuate very rapidly with average value zero .",
    "the amplitude for single chargon tunneling is thus zero , and only cooper pair tunneling occurs .",
    "we therefore then obtain the standard ac josephson effect with frequency @xmath74 .",
    "once again , this result too holds independently of the pairing symmetry of the superconductor .",
    "in particular , this is true despite our description of the cuprate superconductors as a charge @xmath0 condensate .",
    "= 3.3 in    [ ivsist ]    further insight may be obtained by noting that the conventional josephson effect may be thought of as due to a phase - slip process in which @xmath75 vortices pass through the insulator as shown in fig .",
    "[ sisvtx ] .",
    "if the insulator is fractionalized , then it allows free propagation of @xmath76 vortices@xcite .",
    "but the @xmath75 vortices are gapped , and their propagation is suppressed .",
    "indeed , the vison is precisely the remnant of the gapped @xmath75 vortex in the fractionalized insulator@xcite .",
    "motion of an @xmath76 vortex across the junction corresponds to a chargon phase - slip by @xmath77 , or equivalently a cooper pair phase slip by @xmath78 .",
    "this then leads to ac josephson oscillations at frequency @xmath8 .",
    "if the lateral width @xmath55 of the junction is finite , then the visons will slip through the interface at a rate that is exponentially small in @xmath55 .",
    "this will then restore the conventional josephson coupling at long time scales .",
    "thus , the result in eqn . [ jos ] assumes the limit of large @xmath55 as mentioned earlier .",
    "another consequence of the possibility of coherent chargon tunneling through the insulator is that if a dc squid is made with fractionalized insulators for the barriers , the current will be a periodic function of the flux enclosed with period @xmath9 rather than the conventional @xmath2 .",
    "= 3.3 in    [ sisvtx ]    = 3.3 in    [ sistvtx ]    some words of caution are necessary in performing experiments to look for the anamolous ac josephson effect in the undoped cuprate .",
    "first , if the cuprates are fractionalized , it seems most likely that the fractions of the electron are confined along the @xmath79-axis . in particular",
    ", the chargons can not tunnel coherently between successive copper - oxygen layers .",
    "this implies that the anamolous ac josephson effect will be seen only in the geometry in which the @xmath79-axis of the cuprate insulator is parallel to the interface .",
    "second , thus far we have assumed a perfect interface between the superconductors and the insulator .",
    "if the interface is weak , so that the insulator is only weakly connected to one or both superconductors , the anamolous josephson effect will not be seen .",
    "this is because , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , along any line of weak contact , there will be a ( @xmath80 ) phase transition at which coherent chargon ( or spinon ) tunneling across the line will be blocked .",
    "equivalently , along such a  weak line \" , visons can slip through unhindered - this will restore the standard josephson effect .",
    "it is therefore necessary to have interfaces that are good enough that vison slippage through the interface is prevented as it is elsewhere in the junction .",
    "the hallmark of a superconductor is fluxoid quantization , which follows directly from the condensation of a charged boson . in a neutral superfluid ,",
    "it is simply the vortex which is quantized . on the other hand ,",
    "insulating states are characterized by a quantization of the electric charge . a direct way to measure",
    "this quantization is by exploiting the coulomb blockade effect . in a typical geometry",
    "a small metallic  grain",
    "\" is electrically isolated from two metallic leads by the presence of two insulating tunnel barriers . upon tuning the voltage on a gate electrode , @xmath81 , conveniently located to capacitively couple into the metallic grain with capaciatance @xmath42 , it is possible to  charge up \" the grain one electron at a time .",
    "this single electron charging can be detected by measuring the elecrical conductance through the grain as a function of the gate voltage .",
    "one finds a periodic sequence of conductance peaks with spacing @xmath82 - each peak occuring when there is a degeneracy between having @xmath68 and @xmath83 electrons on the grain .",
    "this coulomb blockade experiment can be correctly thought of as the  dual \" of the classic little - parks experiment - under the interchange of flux with charge .",
    "exploiting the coulomb blockade to detect possible electron fractionalization in the underdoped cuprates is problematic since the chargon fragment carries the full electron charge .",
    "but as we now discuss , it should nevertheless be possible if the small metallic grain is replaced by a small superconducting grain .",
    "coulomb blockade experiments involving a small superconducting grain connected to metallic leads via two insulating tunnel barriers have revealed@xcite an astonishing  even - odd \" effect . due to the singlet pairing of electrons on the superconducting grain , adding an extra electron to a grain with an _ odd _ number of electrons is slightly less costly ( the gap energy ) than when the grain has an even number of electrons .",
    "this leads to an observable even - odd effect in the spacing between successive conductance peaks , with the period set by the distance between two peaks : @xmath84 - a charge @xmath6 periodicity corresponding to cooper pairs of electron .    to detect the chargon , we propose redoing this coulomb blockade experiment , making the insulating barriers from undoped cuprate material .",
    "specifically , imagine a small superconducting grain which is electrically isolated from two superconducting leads with tunnel barriers made from undoped cuprate - as depicted schematically in fig [ coulbl ] .",
    "the ideal experiment involves using conventional @xmath72-wave low @xmath1 superconductors@xcite .",
    "we presume that with opaque barriers and a small grain , there is no josephon coupling between the two electrodes .",
    "nevertheless , each of the two barriers can be viewed as a josephson junction connecting the grain to the external leads , with a josephson coupling energy of the general form given in eqn .",
    "if the undoped cuprates are deep within a fractionalized phase , the single chargon hopping term proportional to @xmath61 will dominate the pair tunnelling term . in that case , as one tunes a gate potential which is capacitively coupled to the grain , it should be a chargon which is discretely hopping onto the grain - not an electron or a cooper pair . since the superconducting grain is a chargon condensate ( even for a low @xmath1 material ) , these chargons can be readily absorbed by the condensate .",
    "this implies that the _ conductance peaks should be charge-@xmath0 periodic",
    "_ - @xmath82 - with no even - odd effect present . as in the discussion of the josephson effect , here",
    "too it is necessary to have very good interfaces so that single chargons can move freely through .",

    "vortex pairing\"@xcite .",
    "specifically , a fractionalized insulator descends from a conventional superconductor when two @xmath2 vortices pair and condense .",
    "the resulting @xmath9 vortex - pair condensate leads directly to halving of the charge @xmath6 periodicity on the superconducting grain .",
    "this is the dual analog to the halving of the electron flux quantization in the original little - parks experiment .",
    "several years ago , sachdev , nagaosa and lee@xcite pointed out the possible stability of @xmath9 vortices in the superconducting state close to the transition to a spin - charge separated normal phase .",
    "a single @xmath2 vortex is still a stable object , but a pair of them have higher energy than an @xmath9 vortex . here , we review the physics behind this observation , and use the currently available data to estimate the region of stability of the @xmath9 vortex .",
    "the energy of any vortex in the superconducting state has two contributions .",
    "first there is the energy of the superflow .",
    "this is determined by the superfluid stiffness @xmath85 - the coefficient of the @xmath86 term in the landau - ginzburg free energy for the phase of the cooper pair . for a vortex of strength @xmath87 ,",
    "the superflow energy is given by e_sf = n^2 j ( ) , with @xmath88 being the penetration depth and the coherence lengths , respectively .",
    "the second contribution is the energy in the core of the vortex .",
    "if the underdoped cuprates emerge from a normal state that is fractionalized , the @xmath2 vortex is made possible by the presence of the vison .",
    "thus , the core energy of an @xmath2 vortex includes the energy cost of a vison .",
    "now let us assume that the very underdoped insulator is fractionalized .",
    "then the vison gap is non - zero in the insulator , and is expected to be smooth across the superconductor - insulator transition .",
    "consequently , the core energy of the @xmath2 vortex inside the superconducting state in the very underdoped regime is roughly the same as the vison gap , and is non - zero on approaching the quantum transition to the insulator . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath9 vortex does not have a vison in it s core and it s core energy vanishes on approaching the superconductor - insulator transition assuming it is second order .",
    "( this is also consistent with the idea that the fractionalized insulator may be viewed as a condensate of @xmath9 vortices ) . in our earlier work@xcite",
    ", we have suggested that the vison gap is roughly of the order @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the temperature associated with the pseudogap crossover .",
    "we may therefore estimate e^core _ k_b",
    "t^*.    it is clear from the above that the difference between the energy of a single @xmath9 vortex and that of two well - separated @xmath2 vortices is e^core _ + 2j ( ) - 2 k_b t^*. if the @xmath80 transition from the superconductor to the fractionalized insulator is second order , then the core energy of the @xmath9 vortex must vanish on approaching the transition .",
    "further , we expect that this core energy will essentially be set by @xmath85 - thus it is numerically smaller than the superflow energy by a factor of order @xmath91 ( see below ) . for a rough estimate",
    "we drop it completely .",
    "thus , for the @xmath9 vortex to be cheaper , we need j ( ) k_b t^*. clearly , this will always happen close enough to the transition .",
    "empirically , the zero temperature stiffness is proportional to @xmath92 in the underdoped regime . in @xmath93 , we have@xcite @xmath94 .",
    "further , we have @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "we thus have the rough condition 7t_c t^ * , on the maximum @xmath1 for @xmath9 vortex stability .",
    "the estimate above addresses the issue of the stability of the @xmath9 vortex at zero temperature . on moving up in temperature , the stiffness @xmath85 decreases thereby decreasing the superflow contribution while there should be no significant change in the core energies .",
    "thus , the @xmath9 vortex would gain in stability .",
    "considerable caution is required in trying to observe these stable @xmath9 vortices in experiments .",
    "the force between two @xmath2 vortices is always repulsive at large separation ( much bigger than the core size ) where it is dominated by the superflow .",
    "thus it is necassary for two well - separated @xmath2 vortices to overcome the superflow energy barrier and get close enough before the gain in core energy of the @xmath9 vortex can provide for the attraction to bind them together . in practice ,",
    "depending on the dynamics and the history of the sample , it may be possible for @xmath2 vortices to be observable in some highly metastable state even in a regime in which a single @xmath9 vortex has lower energy than a pair of @xmath2 ones .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a number of tests of the idea that the electron is fractionalized in the underdoped and undoped insulating cuprates .",
    "these experiments are sensitive to the presence of the chargon in the excitation spectrum of the insulator . as such , they allow for a direct experimental probe of the question of whether the undoped cuprate is fractionalized . in our earlier work@xcite , we proposed an experiment to detect the vison in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "this vison detection experiment is however not very suitable to addressing the issue of fractionalization in the undoped cuprate .",
    "the experiments proposed in this paper are thus complementary to this vison detection experiment . taken together , we believe that a positive result in any of these experiments would be compelling evidence for fractionalization of the electron in the cuprates .",
    "we conclude by reemphasizing one intriguing aspect of the results in this paper .",
    "we have argued that in both the ac josephson effect and in the coulomb blockade tunneling experiment , the outcome depends sensitively on whether the insulating tunnel barrier is fractionalized or not . surprisingly , the precise nature (  pairing \" symmetry ) of the superconducting state is unimportant . in particular , both experiments should be possible with conventional low-@xmath1 superconductors .",

    "<S> we propose several tests of the idea that the electron is fractionalized in the underdoped and undoped cuprates . these include the ac josephson effect , and tunneling into small superconducting grains in the coulomb blockade regime . in both cases , we argue that the results are qualitatively modified from the conventional ones if the insulating tunnel barrier is fractionalized . these experiments directly detect the possible existence of the chargon - a charge @xmath0 spinless boson - in the insulator . </S>",
    "<S> the effects described in this paper provide a means to probing whether the undoped cuprate ( despite it s magnetism ) is fractionalized . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the experiments discussed here are complementary to the flux - trapping experiment we proposed in our earlier work@xcite .    </S>",
