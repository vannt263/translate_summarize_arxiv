    "_ bayesian inference _ can be seen both as a sub - field of information theory and of general statistical inference @xcite .",
    "a typical problem in this field is : given observed noisy data and known statistical model of a noisy communication channel ( transition probability ) , as well as a _",
    "prior distribution _ for the input ( a pre - image ) , find the most likely pre - image , or compute the _ a posteriori _ marginal probability for some part of the pre - image .",
    "this field is also deeply related to _",
    "combinatorial optimization _ , which is a branch of optimization in computer science , related to operations research , algorithm theory and complexity theory @xcite .",
    "a typical problem in _ combinatorial optimization _ is : solve , approximate or count ( exactly or approximately ) instances of problems by exploring the exponentially large space of solutions . in many emerging applications ( in magnetic and optical recording , micro - fabrication , chip design , computer vision , network routing and logistics ) ,",
    "the data are structured in a two - dimensional grid ( array ) .",
    "moreover , data associated with an element of the grid are often binary and correlations imposed by the problem are local , so that only nearest neighbors on the grid are correlated .",
    "such problems are typically stated in terms of binary statistical models on planar graphs .    in this paper , we discuss a generic problem of bayesian inference defined on a planar graph .",
    "we focus on the problem of weighted counting , or ( from the perspective of statistical physics ) we aim to calculate the partition function of an underlying statistical model .",
    "as the seminal work of onsager @xcite on the two - dimensional ising model and its combinatorial interpretation by kac and ward @xcite have shown , the planarity constraint dramatically simplifies statistical calculations .",
    "by contrast , three - dimensional statistical models are much more challenging , and no exact results are known .",
    "building on the work of physicists , specifically on results of fisher @xcite and kasteleyn @xcite , barahona @xcite has shown that calculating the partition function of the spin glass ising model on an arbitrary planar graph is _ easy _ , as the number of operations required to evaluate the partition function scales algebraically , @xmath0 , with the size of the system . to prove this ,",
    "the partition function of the spin - glass ising model was reduced to a dimer model on an auxiliary graph , and the partition function was expressed as the pfaffian of a skew - symmetric matrix defined on the graph .",
    "the polynomial algorithm was later used in simulations of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "however , barahona also added a grain of salt to the exciting positive result , showing that generic planar binary problem is difficult @xcite . specifically , evaluating two - dimensional spin glass ising model in a magnetic field is np - hard , i.e. it is a task of likely exponential complexity .    when an exact computational algorithm of polynomial complexity is not available , efficient approximations become relevant .",
    "typically , the approximation is built around a tractable case .",
    "one such approximate algorithm built around the fisher - kasteleyn pfaffian formula was recently suggested by globerson and jaakkola in @xcite .",
    "although this approximation ( coined  planar - graph decomposition \" ) gives a provable upper bound for the partition function for some special graphical models , it constitutes just heuristics , i.e. it suffers from lack of error - control and the inability of gradual error - reduction .",
    "controlling errors in approximate evaluations of the partition function of a graphical model is generally difficult .",
    "however , one recent approach , developed by two of us and called loop calculus @xcite , offers a new method . loop calculus allows to express explicitly the partition function of a general statistical inference problem via an expansion ( the loop series ) , where each term is explicitly expressed via a solution of the belief propagation @xcite , or bethe - peierls @xcite ( bp ) equations .",
    "this brought new significance to the bp concept , which previously was seen as just heuristics .",
    "the bp equations are tractable for any graph ; generally , the number of terms in the loop series is exponentially large , so direct re - summation is not feasible .",
    "however , since any individual term in the series can be evaluated explicitly ( once the bp solution is known ) , the loop series representation offers a possibility for correcting the bare bp approximation perturbatively , accounting for loop contributions one after another sequentially .",
    "this scheme was shown to work well in improving bp decoding of low - density parity check codes in the error - floor regime , where the number of important loop contributions to the loop series is ( experimentally ) small , and the most important loop contributions ( comparable by absolute value to the bare bp one ) have a simple , single - connected structure @xcite . in spite of this progress ,",
    "the question remained : what to do with other truly difficult cases when the number of important loop corrections is not small , and when the important corrections are not necessarily single - connected ? in general",
    ", we still do not know how to answer these questions , while a partial answer for the important class of planar models is provided in this paper .      in this manuscript",
    "we show that , for any graph ( planar or not ) , the partial sum of the loop series over single - connected loops reduces to evaluation of the full partition function of an auxiliary dimer - matching model on an extended , regular degree-3 graph .",
    "weights of dimers calculated on the extended graph are expressed explicitly via solution of the respective bp equations .",
    "the dimer weights can be positive or negative .",
    "in general , summing the single - connected partition is not tractable .",
    "however , in the planar case , it reduces ( through manipulations reminiscent of the fisher - kasteleyn transformations ) to a pfaffian defined on the extended graph , which is also planar by construction .",
    "thus , we find a big class of planar graphical models which are computationally tractable by reduction ( via a bp / gauge transformation ) to a loop series including only single - connected loops , and summable into a pfaffian .",
    "moreover , we find that the partition function of the entire loop series is generally reducible to a weighted pfaffians series , where each higher - order pfaffian is associated with a sum of dimer configurations on a modified subgraph of the original graph .",
    "each term in the pfaffian series is computationally tractable via the belief propagation solution on the original graph .",
    "the material in the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "a formal definition of the model is given in section [ subsec : model ] and a brief description of loop calculus @xcite forms section [ subsec : loopcalc ] .",

    "this research should be of a special interest in the context of recently proposed polynomial quantum algorithm for calculating partition function of the potts model @xcite .",
    "besides , recent progress @xcite shows that a kasteleyn - type approach is extendable to a @xmath99-ary case , leading to the concept of  heaps of dimers \" , and ( in the continuum limit ) to fascinating connections with special , highly symmetric complex surfaces , known as harnack curves .",
    "* one would also be interested to study how ( and if ) phase transitions in the disorder - averaged planar ensembles , e.g. analyzed in @xcite , are related to distribution of parameters characterizing computational tractability ( complexity ) of the models . * in @xcite , the problem of finding all pseudo - codewords in a finite cycle code ( corresponding to the type of graphical model discussed in this paper ) , was addressed by constructing a generating function known as graph zeta function @xcite . the interesting fact discovered in @xcite",
    "is that this generating function of pseudo - codewords has a determinant formulation , based on a discrete graph operator .",
    "hence , one may anticipate an existence of yet uncovered relation between the graph zeta function and a pfaffian - loop resummation of related graphical models .",

    "in this appendix we discuss graphical transformations reducing any binary problem to the vertex - function model described by eq .",
    "( [ p_sigma ] ) , where all vertices are of degree three .",
    "our main focus here is on the planar graphs , and on the graphical transformations preserving planarity .",
    "however some of the transformations and considerations discussed below apply to an arbitrary graph .    , to set of variables , @xmath130 on respective edges .",
    ", width=226 ]    often the original binary model is not represented in the vertex - function form .",
    "some or all binary variables describing a problem may actually be assigned to vertices of a graph , then respective functions are associated with edges and not vertices .",
    "obviously , one can also reformulate the model reducing it to the vertex ( canonical for our purposes ) form .",
    "the transformation is illustrated in figure  [ fig : vtoe ] .",
    "algebraic form of the transformation shown in the figure reads , @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the characteristic function equal to unity if all variables @xmath130 are equal each other and equal to zero otherwise .",
    "-vertex to two @xmath133-vertices .",
    "it is assumed that ( 1 ) number of nodes in the gray area is not large , i.e. @xmath134 , ( 2 ) the new graph ( on the right ) is planar , ( 3 ) ordering ( say clockwise ) of the external nodes is preserved .",
    "the number of parameters characterizing the @xmath33-vertex is @xmath135 or smaller , thus the number of parameters characterizing the two @xmath133 vertices and vertices from the gray area is sufficient , i.e. @xmath136 , to parameterize the original vertex.,width=226 ]    next , let us notice that , given a vertex - function model ( [ p_sigma ] ) with the degree of connectivity higher than three , one can always perform a sequence of transformations reducing the degree of connectivity of all the nodes in the resulting graphical model to three .",
    "an elementary graphical transformation of the kind is illustrated in figure  [ fig : nn-1 ] .",
    "it is assumed that the transformation is applied sequentially to vertices of degree larger than three till none of these are left .",
    "the end result is that : ( a ) there are no vertices of degree larger than three left within the graph ; ( b ) the increase in the total number of vertices is polynomial ; ( c ) if the original graph is planar the resulting graph is also planar .",
    "the set of transformations just described is general , and thus often inefficient , in the sense that knowing specific form of the factor functions one can practically always do a more efficient , customized and simpler reduction .",
    "below we will illustrate this point on examples .          the spin glass ising model is usually defined in terms of @xmath137 variables associated with vertices of the graph @xmath138 where summation under the exponential on the r.h.s .",
    "goes over all edges of the graph , and @xmath139 associated with an edge can be positive or negative .",
    "obviously one can apply the vertex - to - edges transformation , explained in figure  [ fig : vtoe ] , to restate the spin glass ising model as a vertex - function model .",
    "however , in this case one can also do a simpler transformation to the dual graph .",
    "let us consider a planar triangulated graph @xmath140 shown in black in figure  [ fig : triang ] .",
    "all vertices of the respective dual graph , @xmath141 , shown in red in figure  [ fig : triang ] , have degree of connectivity three .",
    "we assume that the spin glass ising model is defined on the planar triangulated graph @xmath140 . defining a new variable @xmath142 on an edge of @xmath141 as the product of two variables of the original graph @xmath143 connected by an edge @xmath144 of @xmath140 crossing the edge @xmath145 of @xmath141",
    ", one finds that the sum on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ ising ] ) , rewritten in terms of the new variables , becomes , @xmath146 .",
    "however , the new variables , @xmath142 are not independent , but rather related to each other via a set of local constraints , @xmath147 : @xmath148 .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ ising ] ) restated in terms of the new variables on the dual graph gets the following compact vertex - style form @xmath149 one interesting observation is that the allowed configurations of @xmath150 on the dual graph correspond exactly to the single - connected loops on @xmath141 , where the loops are built from the excited , @xmath151 , edges . therefore , and",
    "in accordance with discussion of section [ sec : singleloops ] , calculation of the partition function for the spin glass ising is reduced to evaluation of the respective pfaffian , which is the task of a polynomial complexity .",
    "notice also that adding a magnetic field ( linear in @xmath152 ) term in the expression under the exponent on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ isingg ] ) will raise the complexity level to exponential .          consider a linear code with the code - book defined in terms of the bi - partite tanner graph , @xmath153 consisting of @xmath154 bits and @xmath155 parity checks , and the set of edges @xmath156 relating bits to checks and checks to bits .",
    "then a message @xmath157 is a codeword of the code if it satisfies all the parity checks , i.e. @xmath158 .",
    "assuming that all the codewords are equally probable originally , and that the white channel transform a bit @xmath152 of the original codeword into the signal @xmath159 with the probability @xmath160 , one finds that the probability for @xmath161 to be a codeword resulted in the measurement @xmath162 is @xmath163 where , as usual , the partition function @xmath13 is fixed by the normalization condition , @xmath164 .",
    "( [ ldpc ] ) represents an example of a mixed graphical model , with variables @xmath165 defined on bit - vertices , the parity - check functions defined on check - vertices and the channel functions ( carrying the dependencies on the log - likelihoods @xmath166 ) also associated with the bit - vertices . in this case transformation to the vertex - style model is done by direct application of the vertex - to - edges procedure of figure  [ fig : vtoe ] to all the bit - vertices of @xmath68 .",
    "then , the vertex - style version of eq .",
    "( [ ldpc ] ) becomes @xmath167    in general , degree of connectivity of bit - vertices and check - vertices may be arbitrary .",
    "direct application of the general procedure explained above ( see figure  [ fig : vtoe ] and discussion therein ) allows to reduce all the higher - degree nodes to a larger set of nodes of degree three .",
    "however , a simpler dendro - reduction is possible both for the bit - vertices and check - vertices . the dendro trick ( e.g. discussed in @xcite for complexity reduction of a linear programming decoding of ldpc codes )",
    "is schematically illustrated in the two right panels of figure  [ fig : ldpc ] , where respective algebraic relations are @xmath168 and @xmath169 is equal to unity if all arguments are the same , and it is zero otherwise .",
