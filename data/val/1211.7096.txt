    "a variety of techniques have been developed to derive three - dimensional ( 3d ) profile of physical quantities from two - dimensional physical observables on the plane of the sky .",
    "these techniques can be divided into two broad classes that will be denoted here as inverse method and forward - fitting method .",
    "the forward - fitting approach assumes a priori parameterized models for the 3d physical quantity in order to compare its projection with the observables in the plane of the sky @xcite .",
    "@xcite , for example , have developed a formalism to derive the 3d icm temperature profile from spectroscopic sz observations alone using a parametric model .",
    "however , one of the downsides of the forward - fitting method is a need for an a priori parameterization , which might not wholly reflect the 3d physical quantities and not adequately retain the full information e.g. of the temperature profile in the gas distribution .",
    "furthermore , the desired physical parameters of clusters extracted in this way can be prone to large systematic uncertainties , due to simplified modeling of the properties of the hot icm and cluster morphology .",
    "the inverse method , on the other hand , introduces one or more arbitrary parameters to guarantee a smooth and physically acceptable 3d physical quantity by combining x - ray and sz imaging data @xcite .",
    "the main goal of our work is therefore to develop a robust non - parametric approach to derive 3d physical parameters of galaxy clusters from multifrequency sz observations . in order to assess",
    "how accurately one can recover the 3d icm profiles , we analyze mock ccat observations of simulated galaxy clusters extracted from hydrodynamical simulations , taking into account various instrumental noise and astrophysical contaminations .",
    "we also briefly discuss the application of our technique for upcoming multifrequency sz observations . throughout this work",
    "we assume the flat @xmath2cdm model , with matter density parameter @xmath3 , cosmological constant density parameter @xmath4 , and hubble constant @xmath5 where @xmath6 . unless otherwise stated , quoted errors are at the 68.3% confidence level .",
    "the sz effect is a small distortion of the spectra of the cmb , due to the inverse compton scattering of the cmb photons off of hot ( @xmath7 k ) electrons of the icm trapped into the gravitational potential well of the dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "the cmb photons have a low probability @xmath8 of interaction ( @xmath9 is defined as the optical depth ) with the hot electrons of the icm , which increases on average their energy approximately by a factor @xmath10 , producing a distortion of the black - body spectrum of the cmb : this appears as a decrement of the monochromatic flux of the cmb at frequencies smaller than 218 ghz and as an increment at frequencies larger than 218 ghz .",
    "the sz effect is expressed as a small variation in the brightness intensity @xmath11 of the cmb as a function of the observation frequency : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath14 is the electron pressure of the icm at the volume element of coordinate * r * , @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath16 is the line of the sight distance , @xmath17 , @xmath18 k , and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the streaming velocity of the ic gas along the line of sight and it is positive ( negative ) for a receding ( approaching ) cluster .",
    "@xmath21 takes into account the spectral shape of the sz effect and it reads : @xmath22 the first term in equation ( [ eq : deltai2 ] ) is the thermal sz ( tsz ) distortion with spectral shape : @xmath23 where @xmath24 accounts for the frequency dependence of the sz effect , and for the relativistic corrections related to the term @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "its magnitude is given by the comptonization parameter : @xmath26 if we assume a simplified isothermal parameterization of the icm we have @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "note that the relativistic correction term @xmath25 in equation ( [ eq : gx5 ] ) becomes significant at high frequency and/or high icm temperature : for a hot @xmath29  kev clusters , the relativistic corrections are @xmath30% of the total signal at 100 ghz and @xmath31% at 675 ghz , making the sz brightness very prone to the icm temperature .",
    "the second term in equation ( [ eq : deltai2 ] ) is the kinetic sz ( ksz ) distortion , which arises from the doppler shift due to bulk motion of the electrons with respect to the rest frame of the cmb photons .",
    "the spectral shape of the ksz effect is given by , @xmath32 where the term @xmath33 is the relativistic corrections of the ksz effect @xcite , and its magnitude is proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "it is worth noting that in equation ( [ eq : deltai2 ] ) the kinetic distortion is maximal at the crossover frequency ( @xmath35  ghz ) , where the tsz effect vanishes , while at lower or higher frequencies it is smaller than the thermal distortion of a factor @xmath36 for typical values of gas temperature and peculiar velocity relevant for clusters .",
    "note also that , in order to calculate @xmath37 , an a priori measurement of the gas temperature e.g. , from x - ray is needed .",
    "x - ray temperature is also essential for estimating the cluster mass through the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption . for these reasons , sz studies of cluster have have been mostly done in combination with x - ray measurements to date ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we observe that , given the spectral signature of @xmath21 , in principle it is possible to separate the physical variables @xmath38 by deprojecting @xmath11 in equation ( [ eq : deltai ] ) , in order to infer @xmath39 .",
    "sensitive multifrequency sz observations can measure @xmath11 , thereby enabling measurements of the desired physical parameters , including @xmath38 , independently of the x - ray measurements .",
    "specifically , this reconstruction is accomplished by comparing the theoretical prediction of @xmath39 to the deprojected observed quantities . in the next section we present a robust non - parametric approach to reconstruct 3d physical quantities from two - dimensional projected sz maps by inverting equation ( [ eq : deltai ] ) .",
    "a variety of techniques have been developed to derive 3d physical quantities ( e.g. @xmath39 ) from two - dimensional physical observables on the plane of the sky ( e.g. @xmath11 ) . as discussed in ",
    "[ intro ] , in this work , we develop a robust non - parametric approach for inverting equation ( [ eq : deltai ] ) and constraining 3d temperature and pressure profiles from sz - only multifrequency observations .",
    "we assume that the cluster is spherically symmetric and it has a onion  like structure with @xmath40 concentric spherical shells , each characterized by uniform gas density and temperature within it .",
    "therefore , the cluster image in projection is divided into @xmath41 rings ( or annuli ) of area @xmath42 , which are assumed to have the same radii of the 3d spherical shells . the sz boundary ( the most external ring )",
    "will be represented by the @xmath41th ring of area @xmath43 and radius @xmath44 .",
    "let us define @xmath45 as the sz signal to be recovered from the deprojection method within the @xmath46th shell . in our analysis",

    "we assumed that @xmath57 : this means that in @xmath50th ring of the image we account also for the so - called edge effect , i.e. for the contribution of the shells @xmath58 of radius @xmath59 .",
    "now , in order to infer @xmath60 , we introduce two types of information .",
    "the first is a statistical information and allows us to obtain a solution which reproduces the data with a known accuracy . in our case , since the error on the data are assumed to follow a normal distribution , the @xmath61 gives the accuracy of the solution : @xmath62}^{\\rm t}\\#{\\bf",

    "the second information is related to the physics , and it allows us to ensure that the solution is physically acceptable .",
    "we use an approach known as regularization , which involves introducing additional a priori information in order to solve an ill - posed problem .",
    "this information is usually of the form of a penalty for complexity , such as restrictions for smoothness , by reducing the number of degrees of freedom of the problem .",
    "it includes various facts known about the solution a priori , e.g. the total cumulative mass in clusters must be positive , and monotonically increasing regardless the observational data .",
    "it is then necessary to introduce a means of balancing the regularization constraints with the accuracy to which the solution reproduces the data , which is parameterized by @xmath61 .",
    "this has been accomplished by using the lagrangian multipliers to find a solution ; in particular we minimize the function : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a function that is minimized when the solution best satisfies the regularity constraint , and @xmath66 is the smoothing parameter .",
    "we adopt the philips - towmey regularization method @xcite . generally , this method consists of minimizing the sum of the squares of the @xmath67 order derivates of the solution around each data point . for our purposes ,",
    "we define the `` smoothness '' constraint as the minimum of the sum of the squares of the second derivatives , so that : @xmath68 where the @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and the matrix @xmath72 is defined in @xcite .",
    "the solution of equation ( [ kk3 ] ) reads ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath73    by varying @xmath66 , we can therefore vary the degree to which the solution is dominated by consistency with the data ( i.e. it is statistically acceptable ) or with the regularizing constraints ( i.e. it is physically acceptable ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath66 is therefore critical to obtaining a reliable solution . to choose the value of @xmath66 we use the cross - validation , which offers an objective and robust way of choosing the smoothing parameter .",
    "cross - validation consists of predicting each data point @xmath74 by finding a solution using all the data but that point .",
    "the best value of @xmath66 is the one that predicts the observations best , i.e. the one which minimizes the average quadratic errors between the data @xmath74 and their predicted values or the reduced @xmath61 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for further details ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing the improvement of this method with respect to the standard deprojection technique in x - ray spectra ( or surface brightness ) , where customarily the desired solution is inferred via inversion of equation ( [ kk ] ) under the assumption that @xmath75 , neglecting the edge effect . in this case",
    "@xmath76 would be an upper triangular matrix , whose inversion would allow us to determine @xmath60 via equation ( [ kk ] ) . while this approach is commonly employed in the deprojection of x - ray physical observables , such as the x - ray temperature or brightness @xcite , for sz data it would not be satisfactory , because the contribution of the shells with radius greater than the sz boundary is non - negligible ( since the sz effect is linearly proportional to the electronic density , unlike the x - ray brightness ) , and the measurement errors @xmath77 are not taken into account in the determination of the expectation value of @xmath60 .",
    "alternatively , one could extrapolate the profile of @xmath74 via an analytical function out to @xmath78 and consider an @xmath79 upper triangular matrix @xmath76 in order to infer @xmath60 via equation ( [ kk ] ) : nevertheless , in this case the solution could be systematically biased , depending on the assumed extrapolated profile and on the choice of outermost bin . note that in our approach we corrected for the edge effect without assuming any a priori profile of @xmath74 beyond the sz boundary .",

    "given the spectral signature of @xmath21 , we then separate the physical variables @xmath38 by comparing the deprojected observed quantity @xmath60 to its theoretical prediction .",
    "errors have been evaluated via monte - carlo randomization , by generating correlated random numbers @xmath165 with probability density function @xmath166 where @xmath74 is the expectation value and @xmath142 is the covariance .",
    "the final error estimate is accomplished by diagonalizing the covariance matrix @xmath142 . in practice , by using its eigenvectors @xmath167 , we rotate into a space in which the covariance matrix becomes @xmath168 , i.e. it is diagonal with eigenvalues @xmath169 .",
    "we can thus treat the rotated parameters @xmath170 as independent and uncorrelated measurements with probability density @xmath171 . to obtain the probability density function @xmath166 we use the following relation : @xmath172    figure [ ent246 g ] shows the recovery of 3d temperature and pressure profiles from the mock ccat analysis of cl101 and cl104 clusters viewed along three orthogonal projections .",
    "cl101 is a massive , dynamically active cluster , which experiences violent mergers at @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "cl104 is a similarly massive cluster , but with a more quiescent history .",
    "this cluster has not experienced a significant merger for the past 6  gyrs , making it one of the most relaxed systems in the n07 sample .",
    "we find a remarkable agreement between the `` measured '' temperature ( pressure ) profiles and the true mass - weighted temperature ( pressure ) for the relaxed cluster cl104 .",
    "we find a variation of order @xmath175 in both the recovered pressure and temperature profiles obtained for different projections of the same cluster .",
    "the recovery of the icm profiles is still quite good for the unrelaxed cluster cl101 with the systematic bias at the level of @xmath176% , due to the combination of the presence of substructures and the departure of the icm distribution from the spherical symmetry .",
    "moreover , internal bulk motions can introduce additional biases in the derived icm profiles , especially in disturbed systems ( e.g. , characterized by the high values of @xmath86 in table  [ tabdon ] ) . note that via our non - parametric method the full information about the icm profile",
    "is preserved in converting the sz brightness profile to 3d temperature and pressure profiles .",
    "we also assess the impact of the primary cmb anisotropies on the derived icm profiles , by comparing the recovered profiles from the maps with and without cmb anisotropies , while always including the thermal noise .",
    "we find that the bias due to the primary cmb anisotropies is small in the cluster cores , but they become comparable to that of the thermal noise in the outer radii ( @xmath177 ) .    in figure",
    "[ ent246gtt3 ] , we show the mass profiles obtained by applying the hydrostatic equilibrium equation on the temperature and pressure profiles derived from the mock ccat analysis . similarly , we also compute the hydrostatic mass profiles using the mass - weighted temperature and pressure measured directly in simulations .",
    "we then compare these hydrostatic mass profiles to the true mass measured directly from simulations in order to assess the bias in the recovered mass profiles .",
    "we find that the multifrequency ccat sz analysis of individual cluster can recover the hydrostatic mass profiles very accurately in the entire radial range for the relaxed cluster .",
    "note , however , that the hydrostatic mass is biased low compared to the true mass by @xmath178 ( n07b ) , primarily due to the violation of the hydrostatic condition even in the inner regions of a very relaxed cluster ( cl104 ) . in the unrelaxed cluster ( cl101 ) , the bias is larger especially in the outer regions where the departure from the hydrostatic equilibrium is even more significant . note that the bias in the hydrostatic mass could be corrected if we could measure the level of bulk and turbulent gas motions in clusters ( e.g. , by ksz effect ) and account for the non - thermal pressure provided by these components @xcite .    in figure [ entps3xkn3e ]",
    "we demonstrate the recovery of the global properties of the icm , by showing the ratios of the measured and true mass - weighted temperature , integrated compton parameter ( @xmath179 ) , mass - weighted line - of - sight peculiar velocity within a sphere of radius @xmath82 for the sample of simulated clusters .",
    "we find a non - negligible scatter in both the reconstructed temperature and @xmath179 . for 16 hours of ccat observations , the total scatters ( intrinsic plus statistical measurement errors )",
    "are @xmath11313% for the mass - weighted temperature and 4% for @xmath179 , while the intrinsic scatters ( variance of the data points without the measurement errors ) are relatively small ( @xmath180% and @xmath181% , respectively ) , primarily due to substructures and triaxiality of the icm distribution .    in figure [ entps3rkn3 ]",
    ", we assess the impact of various sources of uncertainties by adding contaminants to the tsz signal one at a time , starting with the ksz signal , the relativistic electrons , the primary cmb anisotropies , and the thermal noise in order .",
    "we find that the temperature profile is recovered very well for cl104 .",
    "the recovery is not as accurate for cl101 , in which the recovered temperature could be biased by @xmath182% at any given radius . in absence of other sources of noise ( i.e. , using the tsz data alone )",
    ", the reconstructed 3d temperature profiles are biased by only @xmath183 for cl104 and @xmath184 for cl101 .",
    "biases are generally larger for the unrelaxed systems that exhibit more significant departures from the spherical symmetry indicated in table  [ tabdon ] . at large radii ( @xmath185 ) , we find that the primary cmb anisotropies are one of the main sources of systematic uncertainties in the 3d temperature reconstruction .",
    "for example , at @xmath186 the bias due to the primary cmb anisotropies is @xmath113 10% of the sz signal at 93  ghz . in the inner regions ( @xmath187 ) ,",
    "the primary cmb anisotropies introduce the scatter at the level of 7% and 10% for cl104 and cl101 , respectively .",
    "our analyses indicate that the relativistic electrons , peculiar velocity and thermal noise have little effect on the recovered 3d temperature of a hot ( @xmath90  kev ) galaxy clusters .",
    "recent sz surveys showed that clusters at higher redshift ( e.g. @xmath188 ) seem more disturbed than their low - redshift counterparts @xcite . to assess possible differences expected for high - redshift clusters",
    ", we also analyzed the outputs of the simulated galaxy clusters at @xmath189 .",
    "first , higher - redshift clusters are projected over a smaller area of the sky : this translates into a poorer spatial resolution in the measured three - dimensional parameters and larger measurement errors ( up to 20 - 30% ) due to the larger impact of the cmb anisotropies .",
    "second , the high - redshift clusters are more disturbed on average : this leads to larger systematic errors as well .",
    "galaxy clusters are excellent tracers of the large - scale velocity field in the universe .",
    "the ksz effect , due to the relative motion of the cluster with respect to the rest frame of the cmb , enables direct measurements of the cluster peculiar velocity independently of the cluster distance . in principle",
    ", this technique can be used to measure deviations of the cluster s motion from the hubble flow with high precision at any redshift .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard candle ( e.g. , sne ) whose measurement errors increase monotonically with redshift . in this section",
    "we evaluate how well we can measure the peculiar velocity of clusters using multifrequency sz observations .    in practice",
    ", there are a number of complications for the ksz measurements of the cluster peculiar velocity : ( i ) the ksz effect is much smaller than the tsz effect and is entangled with other contributions to comptonization of the cmb , such as energetic non - thermal electrons : difficulties might arise in separating these different spectral signatures in sz signal @xmath190 via multifrequency sz data ; ( ii ) the blackbody ksz distortion is degenerate with the spectrum the primordial cmb anisotropies , which is also a blackbody ; ( iii ) the observed kinematic sz signal gets significant contributions from the internal gas motions in galaxy clusters , limiting the accuracy of the peculiar velocity measurement at the level of @xmath191  km / s for individual clusters @xcite .    concerning the first point ,",
    "the cluster peculiar velocity is often estimated from the ksz maps alone , by focusing on observations at the crossover frequency at 218  ghz where the tsz emission vanishes .",
    "however , the exact value of the crossover frequency depends weakly on the electron spectrum ( gas temperature and density , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , real observations are obtained with receivers with a finite bandwidth typically of order a few ghz .",
    "the ksz observations are contaminated by other signals , including tsz emission and non - thermal sz from relativistic electrons .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ ent2t8 ] , which shows the ratio between the kinetic and thermal sz effect obtained by receivers with bandwidth of 7.5  ghz and centered on 218  ghz .",
    "we can see that the thermal and kinetic sz signals are comparable in intensity ; i.e. the tsz effect does not fully vanish because of the finite width of the bandwidth and the dependence of the crossover frequency on the gas temperature and density .",
    "to address these issues , we analyze mock ccat simulations in order to assess how well we can measure the peculiar velocity of galaxy clusters . figure [ ent246gf ] shows the reconstructed streaming velocity profile @xmath192 as a function of the cluster - centric radius .",
    "we find that the velocity radial profile @xmath192 in the icm matches the true spherically - averaged cluster peculiar velocity .",
    "our retrieved streaming velocity profiles suggest that systematic uncertainties in the measured @xmath192 is typically of order of 100 km / s , but there are occasional outliers with bias of order a factor 2 in a certain projection axis of disturbed clusters .",
    "for example , the largest bias is found in cl106 , which is a disturbed system with a large value of @xmath86 ( table  [ tabdon ] ) .",
    "therefore , one way to control such a large bias is to consider only relaxed systems with a low value of @xmath86 and average the peculiar velocity out to the sz boundary .",
    "note also that the biases are present even in relaxed systems due to frequent minor mergers that continuously perturb the clusters gas atmosphere @xcite .",
    "next , we consider the mass - weighted peculiar velocity averaged within a circular aperture . averaging out within a fixed radius has two advantages : ( i ) the mass - weighted peculiar velocity is more easily obtainable with sz observations with moderate angular resolution ; ( ii ) the bias in the measured mass - weighted streaming velocity tends to be smaller than the differential radial profiles @xmath192 . in figure [ entps3xkn3e ]",
    "we present the ratios between the measured and true peculiar velocities obtained along three orthogonal projections , where the recovered velocity is mass - weighted averaged inside a circular aperture of radius equal to the boundary of the observation . for most of the objects ,",
    "the average peculiar velocities derived from different projection axes are consistent within statistical errors of order @xmath193  km / s ( corresponding to a fractional uncertainty of @xmath194% ) .",
    "this dispersion sets a theoretical lower limit on the accuracy with which cluster peculiar velocity can be measured for an individual cluster .",
    "the bias in the averaged peculiar velocity mainly arises from : ( i ) internal motions of the icm , which gives an systematic error of around @xmath191  km / s @xcite ; ( ii ) triaxiality , which introduces an systematic error of @xmath195  km / s ; ( iii ) systematic intensity change @xmath196 due to relativistic electrons , which gives an systematic error of @xmath197  km / s .",
    "these errors are also largely independent of the cluster redshift , in contrast to galaxy peculiar velocity surveys . therefore , ksz measurements of the cluster peculiar velocities might serve as promising tools for studying cosmology , including the expansion history of the universe , the matter density of the universe , the primordial power spectrum normalization , and the dark energy equation of state @xcite .",
    "in this paper we presented a non - parametric inversion method for reconstructing 3d temperature and pressure profiles of the icm from multifrequency sz observations . in order to assess the accuracy to which the 3d physical parameters can be recovered from observations",
    ", we analyzed mock cerro chajnantor atacama telescope ( ccat ) observations of simulated clusters , while taking into account several sources of uncertainties associated with instrumental effects and astrophysical foregrounds .",
    "we showed that our method enables the recovery of the 3d icm temperature and pressure profiles out to large radius ( @xmath198 ) of a hot ( @xmath199  kev ) cluster , while retaining full information about the gas distribution .",
    "accurate recovery of the icm pressure and temperature profiles , in turn , enables accurate determination of the mass - weighted temperature , integrated sz signal ( @xmath179 ) , and the cluster mass profiles assuming the hydrostatic equilibrium of the gas in the cluster potential .",
    "we found that the bias in the reconstructed 3d icm and mass profiles are dominated by substructures and asphericity of the cluster gas distribution , while the contaminations by thermal noise , relativistic electrons and the cmb anisotropies are small .",
    "note also that the hydrostatic mass is a biased estimate of the true cluster mass , due to the presence of non - thermal pressure provided by bulk and turbulent gas motions . a joint analysis of sz and",
    "lensing measurements may help constrain the biases due to triaxial shape and non - thermal pressure further @xcite .",
    "we also assessed the accuracy to which the cluster s peculiar velocity could be measured with upcoming multifrequency observations of the ksz effect .",
    "we find that there is a non - negligible total scatter of @xmath200% for individual clusters . for 16h hours of ccat observation ,",
    "the measurement errors are still dominated by statistical uncertainties , instead of systematic uncertainties .",
    "the systematic bias in the averaged peculiar velocity mainly arises from : ( i ) internal motions of the icm ( @xmath201  km / s ) ; ( ii ) triaxiality ( @xmath195  km / s ) ; ( iii ) systematic intensity change @xmath196 due to relativistic electrons ( @xmath197  km / s ) .",
    "thus , ccat measurements of the cluster peculiar velocities via ksz effect should serve as unique and potentially powerful probes of the dynamics of the universe and cosmological parameters .",
    "the inversion method presented here should be a valuable tool for analyzing multifrequency sz observations of galaxy clusters . while the sz effect has been used mainly for constraining the electronic pressure to date , high - resolution , multifrequency sz observations ( e.g. , by ccat ) will enable detailed characterization of the temperature and velocity structures in the icm , without follow - up x - ray observations .",
    "sz observations are especially unique and powerful in probing the outskirts of high - redshift clusters and complementary to x - ray observations which are sensitive to the inner regions of nearby clusters . in this sense ,",
    "ccat sz observations are complementary to the upcoming erosita x - ray cluster survey with comparable angular resolutions .",
    "furthermore , ccat sz observations will provide unique constraints on the cluster peculiar velocities and possibly internal gas flows especially in the outskirts of high - redshift clusters , which are difficult to measure using the upcoming astro - h mission via shifting and broadening of x - ray spectral lines .",
    "the present work is a step forward toward robust reconstruction of the 3d icm , mass , and streaming velocity profiles for a sample of clusters and promises to help advance cosmological studies based on the cluster growth over cosmic time in the coming decade .",
