    "the quasar 3c273 ( z=0.158 ; schmidt 1963 ) is one of the most studied superluminal radio sources ( e.g. zensus et al .",
    "1990 ) . due to its brightness and proximity",
    "( 1 milliarcsecond corresponds to 1.85 parsec ; @xmath0=100kms@xmath1mpc@xmath2 , @xmath3=0.5 ) , it has been the target of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations over a wide range of radio frequencies .",
    "the radio structure of 3c273 shows a well defined core - jet morphology from the mas scale up to the arcsecond scale .",
    "the jet extends out to @xmath420 arcseconds with the ridge line of emission showing a clear ` wiggle ' ( davis et al .  1985 ) .",
    "vlbi imaging at frequencies from 5 to 100ghz has shown that the ridge line of the jet is curved on a scale from 0.05 to 25 mas , oscillating around the main orientation of the jet ( bth et al .",
    "1991 ; krichbaum et al .",
    "1990 ; zensus et al .",
    "zensus et al .  (",
    "1990 ) , examining the positions of the components at various epochs , pointed out that major bends apparently occur at about 0.2 , 34 , 1011 and 1517 mas from the core .",
    "they also suggest that discrepancy in the position angles of some of the components observed at different frequencies may represent a spectral index gradient across the jet which implies a frequency dependence of the jet ridge line in the evolution of parsec - scale jet .",
    "krichbaum et al .",
    "( 1990 ) investigated the jet structure and showed that there are clear indications that the jet bends along its entire length down to @xmath41 mas .",
    "( there are too few observations interior to this ) .",
    "they also pointed out that the ridge line in the jet has a quasi - sinusoidal shape .",
    "we present here vlbi observations of 3c273 at 22ghz and 43ghz .",
    "they were performed as part of a multi - frequency campaign carried out from december 12 , 1992 to january 24 , 1993 .",
    "results from the x - ray observations can be found in leach et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and for the mm - band observations in m@xmath5hardy et al .",
    "hybrid maps at the two frequencies for four out of five epochs of observations will be shown .",
    "model - fitting of the final data set obtained as a result of the imaging / self - calibration process had performed also .",
    "an analysis of the source structure in the first 8 mas of the jet and measurements for short time - scale structural variations in 3c273 are presented and the results discussed .",
    "the vlbi observations used an array consisting of the vlba and effelsberg , medicina and noto at 22ghz , while the stand - alone vlba was used at 43ghz .",
    "five sets of observations were made from december 1992 to january 1993 at roughly 10 day intervals .",
    "data were recorded on markiiia compatible terminals , in mode e ( 14 mhz bandwidth ) .",
    "typically , each scan had lasted 13 minutes .",
    "the data were correlated at the array operations centre in socorro , new mexico .",
    "the correlator output was calibrated in amplitude and phase using @xmath6 is the nrao s _ astronomical image processing system _ ] and imaged using difmap ( shepherd et al .",
    ".    the amplitude calibration of vlbi observations at 22ghz and 43ghz , is mainly limited by the lack of point source calibrators .",
    "system temperature measurements were made at the end of each scan and the gain curve of each telescope was used to correct the variation of effective antenna gain with antenna elevation for all telescopes .",
    "the calibration accuracy differs between observing sessions , owing to different weather conditions .",
    "( millimetric observations are sensitive to the water vapor content of the atmosphere . )",
    "images were made for each calibrator source scheduled for a few scans during the observing program , namely 0804@xmath7499 and 1611@xmath7343 at 22ghz , oj287 and bllac at 43ghz . from an inspection of the visibility plots",
    ", it appears that these sources were barely resolved with the array and are therefore reasonable calibrators . the poor _ uv_-plane coverage ( @xmath43700 and @xmath45000 visibilities on average at 22ghz and43ghz respectively ) and the rms noise ( @xmath4 14mjy ) did not allow these to be mapped properly .",
    "much of the flux from their jet structure ( see kellermann et al .",
    "1998 ) is clearly lost .",
    "we were able to image the central brightest component only and most of the emission from the more extended structure is missed .",
    "the self - calibration procedure , which uses closure amplitudes to determine telescope amplitude corrections , gave calibration factors that are within 10% of unity .",
    "total power measurements , contemporary with the vlbi observations , were not available for the calibrators .",
    "these sources are known to be highly variable with time at high frequencies .",
    "light curves at 22ghz for 1611@xmath7343 and oj287 can be found in tornikoski et al .",
    "the ratio between our extrapolated ` zero baseline ' flux density and the total power flux density is @xmath40.75 for both 1611@xmath7343 and oj287 .",
    "tornikoski et al .",
    "( 1994 ) also report monitoring observations for bl  lac at 37ghz . here",
    ", the ratio between the two flux densities is @xmath80.5 .",
    "however , bl  lac has a more extended structure than 1611@xmath7343 and oj287 and we were unable to image this successfully .",
    "the total correlated flux density for 3c273 at both frequencies is about one half of the total power measurements with single dish .",
    "however , correlated flux and total power flux follow a similar trend ( see , for example von montigny et al .  1997 ) . more recent 22ghz vlba observations by leppnen et al .  (",
    "1995 ) do show a similar ratio .",
    "in conclusion we estimate that the systematic amplitude calibration errors for any of the data sets are @xmath9 .    during session four",
    "( 14 january 1993 ) , the array was so heavily affected by adverse weather conditions that only crude images could be made . data from that session will not be used in the following discussions .",
    "table 1 summarizes the observational data and imaging .",
    "column 1 : project name ; column 2 : date of the observation ; column 3 : observing frequency ; column 4 : stations ; column 5 : beam major axis ; column 6 : beam minor axis ; column 7 : major axis position angle ; column 8 : dynamic range , i.e. the ratio between the peak flux density and the rms noise in the image , measured far from the source of emission .    * table1 - vlbi observations of 3c273 *    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,^,^,>,^ , > \" , ]     in the _ x_-direction , components 4 and 5 change their separation from the core at the same apparent speed , with values in agreement with previous measurements obtained with observations which had a much larger time sampling . component 3 has a lower speed , while component 2 shows a separation from the core which _ decreases _ with time .",
    "the probability given from the reduced chi - square analysis to obtain a similar fit by random is @xmath10 .",
    "such a reverse speed , if real , has not been observed in a superluminal source before .",
    "y_-direction , where the positional accuracy is lower , we have sufficient resolution to be able to measure the apparent speed of the components .",
    "component 2 seems to be stationary with respect to the core .",
    "components 3 and 4 are moving north with different speeds , while component 5 is moving in a direction opposite to component 4 .    in table6 the projected velocities , obtained by combining the two velocity components , are given ( columns 6 and 7 respectively ) .",
    "the direction of the radial velocity vectors are not parallel to the jet axis , of course , in agreement with the view that the components in 3c273 are moving along a wiggling path .",
    "the observations at 22ghz and 43ghz were quasi - simultaneous during the full series of sessions . in order to estimate the spectral indices of the components , we have used the flux densities obtained from model - fitting the source structure . at 22ghz ,",
    "the adopted flux densities come from data sets with comparable _ uv _ ranges to the 43ghz observations ( i.e.@xmath11m@xmath12 ) .",
    "the spectral index of each component for each session is shown in fig.14 .    among the five components ,",
    "only component 1 , believed to be the core of emission , has an inverted spectrum . during the last session ,",
    "the flux density of the core at 43ghz is much higher than at 22ghz and the spectrum more inverted .",
    "this might suggest that a new component is emerging from the core itself .",
    "all of the components along the jet do show a steep spectrum , which steepens progressivle with distance from the core .",
    "the spectral indices @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , are in the following ranges : component 1 between 0.2 and @xmath151.5 ; component 2 between 0.2 and 1.9 ; component 3 between 0.7 and 1.2 ; component 4 between 1.1 and 3.0 ; component 5 between 1.3 and 2.2 .",
    "these spectral indices are quite steep",
    ". this may be because some flux density was lost at 43ghz because of the better resolution in the north - south direction .",
    "it is difficult to model the weak components in the region from 2 to 8 mas from the core . to visualize the outer part of the jet ,",
    "the position of the peak of the emission for each blob has been derived from the hybrid maps of figs.18 . as a reference point",
    "we have taken the strongest component in the images ; this corresponds to component 3 in the model - fitting .    from this",
    "we find that , to within the positional accuracy , the components are co - moving with the reference component , _",
    "i.e. _ we do not detect any change in separation with time between the reference point and any blob in the outer part of jet during the period of our observations .",
    "the position of the peak of emission derived for each component from both the 22ghz and 43ghz images is plotted in fig.15 together with the estimated errors , weighted by the signal - to - noise ratio of those components .",
    "the linear - correlation coefficient obtained by fitting the points with a straight line gives @xmath150.27 which is rather poor .",
    "the straight line drawn in fig.15 represents the major axis pa@xmath16 of the jet . obviously , the points lie both above and below that straight line .",
    "the second line represents a polynomial , which fits the distribution of the series of data and has a multiple - correlation coefficient very close to 1 .",
    "the points at 22ghz and 43ghz are fully mixed .",
    "independent polynomial fits to the two series of data give almost identical results .",
    "we do not see any effects of opacity on the component positions within the accuracy of our measurements .",
    "the jet path is not collinear with the major axis and the wiggles , are now clearly tracked . from fig.15",
    "we can derive the wavelength of the oscillation , which is @xmath86 mas ( or @xmath811 pc ) .",
    "the sub - arcsecond scale structure of the radio jet in 3c273 has been investigated by many authors using radio interferometric observations .",
    "in addition to the superluminal motion detected in the core with vlbi at high frequencies , these investigations also show that the ridge - line of the jet shows a wiggle. davis et al .",
    "( 1985 ) were able to track the ridge over the whole 21 arcseconds length of the jet in their 1 arcsecond resolution merlin 408mhz image .",
    "they interpret the wiggle in terms of precession in the central object with a period of 15@xmath17 years , assuming a deceleration in the jet material and an apparent tranverse velocity which equals the superluminal value observed a few mas from the core .",
    "zensus et al .  (",
    "1990 ) , combining their 5ghz vlbi observations with those available in literature , pointed out that the ridge line appears to oscillate around the main orientation of the jet , with major bends apparently being located at about 0.2 , 34 , 1011 and 1517 mas from the core . with their investigation zensus et al .",
    "( 1990 ) were also able to track the components loci in one case , suggesting that that component had followed the same path .",
    "similar results were obtained by krichbaum et al .",
    "( 1990 ) when adding observations at 43ghz .",
    "they were able to track the bending in the inner jet down to @xmath40.5 mas from the core and pointed out that strongly - bent jets in regions close to the core are a common phenomenon  for example , these are seen in 3c345 , 3c84 and 1803 + 784 .    the image of 3c273 produced by bth et al .",
    "( 1991 ) at 100ghz with a resolution of 50 @xmath18as shows that the jet has a position angle which is significantly different from those observed at lower frequencies .",
    "they claim that the inner structure has a more pronounced wiggling structure than seen on larger scales .",
    "table2 summarizes the pas of the jet major axis in 3c273 at several angular scales .",
    "the differences between pas suggest that the wiggle can be seen on all angular scales ; this suggests that there is a common mechanism responsible for this . from this point of view , the observations presented here add important pieces of information on the inner jet structure of 3c273 .",
    "first of all , in the 42 days of monitoring done , we do not detect any dramatic structural variation along the jet .",
    "there is a good evidence for jet bending , which starts inside the first parsec from the core .",
    "we have also been able to measure the apparent speeds of the inner jet components in orthogonal directions .",
    "the values obtained are generally consistent with those available in the literature ( i.e. zensus et al .  1990 ) .",
    "additionally , we find ( i ) a counter - moving component and ( ii ) that along the _",
    "y_axis , there are components which move in opposite direction .",
    "those behaviours are strong indications for a precessing jet .",
    "in fact , the geometry which permits us to see apparent recessional motion in an approaching object requires the object to be moving along a spiral path about an axis close to the observer s line of sight .",
    "moreover , the tranverse speeds for the outer components are likely to be higher than for the components closest to the core .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the ` core ' of the source is actually component 2 . in this case , components 3 , 4 and 5 are moving at lower speeds with respect to the core",
    ". component 1 would then be part of the counter - jet .",
    "this does not agree with the observation that component 1 is the only one showing an inverted spectral index .",
    "moreover , its apparent speed would be significantly lower than that infreed from these observations    the case for a precessing jet is made stronger by the distribution of the loci of the peaks of emission for the components detected in the region of the jet from 2 to 8 mas .",
    "their quasi - sinusoidal distribution indicates a pattern wavelength of @xmath196mas . assuming an apparent tranverse velocity of @xmath20 and using @xmath21 ( davis et al .  1985 )",
    ", we derive a period t@xmath227 years .",
    "this value should be considered as an upper limit .",
    "it is clear from the model - fitting that the jet starts wiggling even closer to the core .",
    "the available resolution is not good enough to derive a firm period for that oscillation .",
    "the derived period is very short compared with that estimated by davis et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and two orders of magnitude shorter than that given by roos ( 1988 ) for active galaxies during their final , most luminous stage .",
    "a comparably small value of 22 years was derived for the precessing period of the jet in 3c279 ( abraham et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that the positions derived from the 22ghz and 43ghz images are fully mixed .",
    "the fits for the two series of dots are rather similar .",
    "since we are observing in the optically thin part of the spectrum , we would not see any frequency dependence of positions transverse to the jet .",
    "this effect would cause the jet to appear more curved at higher frequency due to opacity effects suggested by zensus et al .",
    "observations at lower frequencies ( in the optically - thick regime ) with similar resolution are needed to confirm this definitively .",
    "the source 3c273 is not the only blazar showing curved trajectories .",
    "sources like 1803@xmath7784 ( kellermann et al .",
    "1998 ) , 3c279 ( unwin et al .  1998 ) , 3c84 ( dawhan et al .",
    "1998 ) , 3c454.3 ( pauliny - toth 1998 ) , 0836@xmath7710 ( otterbein et al .  1998 ) and 3c345 ( lobanov & zensus 1998 ) do show oscillations in their jet trajectories .",
    "the morphology of the last two sources has been explained in terms of kelvin - helmholtz instabilities . in 3c345 ,",
    "the components propagate with constant apparent speed along a helically - twisted trajectory .",
    "hardee ( 1987 ) was able to explain this successfully using a model for the helical twisting of a light relativistic jet expanding in response to an external pressure gradient .",
    "a similar approch has been used by otterbein et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to explain the displacements in the jet of 0836@xmath7710 .",
    "the present observations can not exclude the possibility that the morphology in 3c273 can be modelled with kelvin - helmholtz instabilities .    an alternative model for the helical path of some relativistic jets ,",
    "invokes a shock wave propagating along curved trajectories .",
    "such a model has been discussed by gomez et al .",
    "( 1993 , 1994 ) . in it ,",
    "the strongest emission is obtained when the shock wave reaches the bent regions towards the observer .",
    "we thank the staffs at the telescopes and at the correlator for their kind collaboration .",
    "the national radio astronomy observatory is a facility of the national science foundation operated under the cooperative agreement by associated universities inc .",
