    "stochastic pattern formation is ubiquitous in science and technology ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the many references therein ) .",
    "some examples include viscous fingering in fluids , dendritic crystallization , electro - deposition , dielectric breakdown and the growth of bacterial colonies .",
    "it is remarkable that , despite their disparate physical origins , many such patterns can essentially be described by one of two generic models .",
    "these models are distinguished by the nature of the stochastic growth at the interface , which is usually taken to be either : ( i ) uniform  as in the eden model @xcite , or ( ii ) laplacian  as in the diffusion - limited aggregation model @xcite .",
    "these generic models and their numerous refinements have been intensively studied and have proved highly successful in describing the growth of patterns in which one stable phase propagates into a second unstable phase .",
    "for example , in the formation of snowflakes the snow crystal ( stable phase ) propagates into water vapour ( unstable phase ) . in viscous fingering a low viscosity fluid ( stable phase )",
    "is pumped under pressure into a background high viscosity fluid ( unstable phase ) .",
    "these are examples of laplacian growth processes .",
    "an example of a uniform growth process is the spread of a bacterial colony ( stable phase ) via cell - division into a nutrient - rich environment ( unstable phase ) @xcite .",
    "however , many important growth processes have two or more competing unstable phases .",
    "an example is the williams - bjerknes ( wb ) model @xcite for the growth of tumours , in which both the cancerous cells and the normal cells are unstable ( both may be displaced by cell division ) .",
    "the limiting growth is governed by this competition .",
    "the cancerous cells have the competitive advantage of dividing faster than normal cells .",
    "importantly , early simulations of the model @xcite revealed that the invasive nature of the tumours can be accounted for solely by an almost evenly balanced contest between the cancerous cells and the normal cells .",
    "these early simulations also investigated the regression probability , defined as the probability that the advantaged phase , starting out as a single seed , will become extinct under the growth process .",
    "subsequent simulations @xcite and rigorous mathematical studies @xcite revealed that the abnormal region , whenever it survives , can be described as an asymptotic shape ( with a one - dimensional boundary ) , the average radius of which grows linearly in time .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a class of uniform stochastic growth models ( which includes the wb model ) involving competition between two phases .",
    "the equilibrium populations of the competing phases are calculated using a mean field analysis similar to that used recently for a dynamical model of virus spread @xcite .",
    "leading order approximations for regression probabilities are also calculated .",
    "the mean field results and regression results are in good agreement with simulations carried out on a square lattice with periodic boundaries .",
    "consider a regular lattice with @xmath0 sites where @xmath1 are of type @xmath2 and @xmath3 are type @xmath4 .",
    "define an interface site as one which has one or more nearest neighbouring sites of the opposite type .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the number of type @xmath2 interface sites and type @xmath4 interface sites respectively .",
    "the total number of nearest neighbour sites surrounding a lattice site is the lattice co - ordination number denoted here by @xmath7 ( for example , @xmath8 on the square lattice ) .    in the models below the numbers of type @xmath2 sites and type @xmath4 sites change in time as a consequence of interface interactions which occur when an interface site is changed into the opposite type .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the probability for site @xmath10 to be changed to a type @xmath4 site and similarly for @xmath11 .",
    "the complete set of transition probabilities for the site @xmath10 are then ; @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is used to represent the situation in which site @xmath10 is a type @xmath2 site and a type @xmath4 site respectively .",
    "the mean field probability that a @xmath4 site will be changed into an @xmath2 site is thus @xmath15 similarly @xmath16 is the mean field probability that an @xmath2 site will be changed into a @xmath4 site . using these probabilities",
    "we can write down general mean field population equations for this class of models which relates the numbers of species before ( time @xmath17 ) and after ( time @xmath18 ) an interface interaction : @xmath19 the mean field steady state defined by @xmath20 and @xmath21 thus yields the ( equivalent ) equilibrium conditions @xmath22 we shall make use of both forms of the mean - field equilibrium condition in the following .",
    "note that the steady state mean field probabilities @xmath23 and @xmath24 are in general functions of @xmath25 .",
    "in the wb model , the spread of cancers is modelled by the growth of two types of cells , cancerous cells and normal cells , which compete via cell division in a basal layer . the cancerous cells are taken to divide @xmath26 times faster than normal cells .",
    "this factor @xmath26 is called the carcinogenic advantage .",
    "it is supposed that when a cell in the basal layer divides the daughter cell displaces a neighbouring cell up out of the basal layer @xcite .",
    "the implementation of the model is straightforward .",
    "start with a regular lattice of sites ( basal layer ) labelled type @xmath2 ( cancerous ) or type @xmath4 ( normal ) .",
    "select a site at random with a bias ( due to the carcinogenic advantage ) for selecting type @xmath2 .",
    "choose one of the neighbouring sites of the selected site at random and convert it to the same type as the selected site .",
    "typically there are many growth steps that do not change the configuration of the basal layer .",
    "we have simulated this model within a rectangular region covering @xmath27\\times [ -100,100]$ ] square lattice sites using periodic boundaries in both directions .",
    "initially the top half of the rectangular region is comprised of abnormal cells and the bottom half is comprised of the normal cells .",
    "the configurations of normal and abnormal cells for the case @xmath28 are shown at four different time snapshots in fig .",
    "two points of note are : i ) the interface between normal and abnormal cells is highly irregular ; ii ) the ratio abnormal cells to normal cells increases in time until ( on average ) the advantaged species completely dominates .      to determine the mean field equilibrium state for this model we first define the model transition probabilities .",
    "the probability that a site @xmath10 will be changed ( @xmath29 ) or reconfigured ( @xmath30 ) into type @xmath2 is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of neighbouring @xmath2 sites adjoining site @xmath10 .",
    "the first factor is the carcinogenic advantage for a division of an @xmath2 cell .",
    "the second factor is the probability that the @xmath2 cell chosen for division is one of the neighbours of site @xmath10 .",
    "the final factor is the probability that if a neighbouring @xmath2 cell for site @xmath10 is chosen for division it will displace the cell at site @xmath10 out of the basal layer leaving an @xmath2 cell at that location .",
    "similarly the probability that a site @xmath10 will be changed or reconfigured into type @xmath4 is @xmath33 the normalization of the probabilities , @xmath34 follows immediately from the identities @xmath35    substituting the expressions for the transition probabilities ( [ wbia ] ) , ( [ wbib ] ) into the mean field equilibrium condition ( [ eqm2 ] ) yields @xmath36 this result can be simplified by the identity @xmath37 which follows from the eqs ( [ identitya ] ) , ( [ identityb ] ) , together with the neighbour summation rule @xmath38 . using the identity ( [ identity ] ) the mean field equilibrium result ( [ wbe1 ] ) simplifies to @xmath39 from our stochastic simulations described above",
    "we have have obtained a plot in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] of the time taken for all @xmath4 cells to die out ( @xmath40 ) and the time for all @xmath2 cells to die out ( @xmath41 ) as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "the extinction time rapidly increases with decreasing @xmath43 and there is a clear possibility for a steady state with both species at @xmath44 .",
    "a different form of the equilibrium condition can be derived by writing the mean field probability that any @xmath4 type cell is changed into an @xmath2 type cell as @xmath45 the first factor on the right is the probability that an @xmath2 cell divides , the second factor is the probability that the dividing @xmath2 cell is an interface cell and the third factor is the probability that @xmath2 interface cells displace @xmath4 interface cells ( there is a finite probability that @xmath2 cells might divide without any resultant change in the configuration ) . similarly the mean field probability that any @xmath2 type cell is changed into a @xmath4 type cell can be written as @xmath46 substituting ( [ wbbanew ] ) and ( [ wbabnew ] ) into the mean field equilibrium condition ( [ eqm1 ] ) now yields @xmath47 comparing ( [ wbeqm1 ] ) with the previous equilibrium condition ( [ wbeqm ] ) we obtain the additional equilibrium result @xmath48    note that in general we can write @xmath49 where the factor @xmath50 is included because some of the @xmath4 interface cells are counted more than once in the sum , and similarly @xmath51 combining ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) with the identity ( [ identity ] ) thus yields @xmath52 comparing the general result ( [ e3 ] ) with the equilibrium condition ( [ wbeqm2 ] ) we now have @xmath53      here we consider the case in which a single cancerous site ( @xmath54 ) is surrounded by normal sites ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the transition probabilities are thus @xmath56 summing over the lattice sites we have @xmath57    the probability @xmath58 is the probability for regression in one step .",
    "the probability for regression without any growth within @xmath59 steps is given by @xmath60 and the probability for regression without growth after infinitely many steps is @xmath61    we anticipate that the probability for regression without growth will be the dominant term in the overall probability for regression , which includes the probability for regression after growth , so that ( [ wbregress ] ) may be taken as a leading order approximation .",
    "to investigate this further consider regression within three steps .",
    "the possible scenarios and associated probabilities are : @xmath62 the sum of the probabilities in the first three scenarios above is the probability for regression without growth within three steps ( eq ( [ regressm ] ) with @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 is the probability @xmath65 in a cluster with two adjacent type @xmath2 cells .",
    "it immediately follows that the ratio the probability for regression after growth within three steps to the probability for regression without growth within three steps scales as @xmath66 .",
    "we have studied regression in simulations with @xmath28 over @xmath67\\times [ -10,10]$ ] sites on a square lattice . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we have plotted the frequency of regression within three , five and ten steps versus the total number of runs used in the frequency estimate , over a range of the total number of runs up to @xmath68 .",
    "the upper two horizontal lines on the plot are the probabilites for regression without growth after five and ten steps and the lower horizontal line is the full probability for regression after three steps .",
    "the comparison between the monte carlo results and the algebraic regression results provides evidence that regression without growth dominates the regression process .      in the limit",
    "@xmath69 the @xmath4 cells never divide and the transition probabilities become : @xmath70    in this case there are only two possible events @xmath30 and @xmath29 . the event @xmath30 affects the time scale for configurational changes but does not affect the configurations themselves . hence if we do not concern ourselves with the time scales for change we can set @xmath71 and renormalize @xmath72 where the sum is over all type @xmath4 interface sites . in this",
    "limit the model is equivalent to the original model introduced by eden @xcite , which is also referred to as the eden b model @xcite .",
    "in this model only interface sites are considered for division . select an interface site at random with a bias for selecting type @xmath2 and convert one of the neighbouring sites of the selected site to a site of the same type .",
    "note that this model still allows non - configurational changes where the number of type @xmath2 interface sites and the number of type @xmath4 interface sites may both be conserved after a growth event .",
