    "investigations of such magnetic fields through spectropolarimetric observation were reported recently @xcite . together with a suitable inversion technique , which takes into account the joint action of the hanle and zeeman effects , full - stokes polarimetry is in fact a powerful diagnostic tool to obtain information about the three - dimensional geometry of the magnetic fields that channel the spicular motion . in particular",

    "every 2 minutes simultaneous measurements of stokes @xmath1 , @xmath2 and one linear polarization component ( alternatively @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) was stored allowing to observe the time evolution . despite of the fact that the dynamic jets that we call spicules have a lifetime of 5 - 10 minutes , the general structures of the obtained stokes images remained almost similar even during the long measurements .",
