    "intergalactic globular clusters ( igcs ) are not bound to any particular galaxy but move freely in the potential wells of galaxy clusters .",
    "table 1 will help the reader with the notation used in this paper .",
    "the existence of igcs has been considered by a number of authors .",
    "the first discussion about them was by @xcite , who measured the distance to the abell no .  4 globular cluster ( gc ) . obtaining a distance modulus of 20.8",
    ", he concluded that it is therefore an _ intergalactic tramp_. van den bergh ( 1958 ) estimated that the number of igcs within the local group is one third of the total number of gcs .",
    "but the first real quantitative studies of igcs in galaxy clusters were done by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that galaxies in galaxy clusters suffer several dynamical effects owing to encounters with neighboring galaxies and to the action of the general galaxy cluster field ; as a result , galaxies lose some gcs .",
    "since these processes are very sensitive to the distribution of the total mass of the galaxy cluster , the study of igcs may help us to solve the problem of how the _ missing mass _ is distributed . in this scenario ,",
    "the number density of lost igcs should follow the total mass distribution ; hence , they might be concentrated toward the center of the galaxy cluster . in the same context",
    ", @xcite suggested that cd envelopes and the diffuse light in coma have the same origin : they are composed of stars tidally stripped from galaxies during coma s collapse .",
    "so gcs might have been stripped as well , creating an igc population .",
    "alternatively , if igcs do exist in galaxy clusters , they may have been formed in situ in scenarios such as biased gc formation .",
    "@xcite argued that the number density of gcs in biased formation scenarios is extremely sensitive to the presence and amplitude of a background field , such as galaxy cluster - sized and galaxy - sized perturbations in the primordial matter distribution .",
    "gcs would have been much more likely to form in developing protogalaxies than in complete isolation , but a small number of igcs is expected . in these scenarios ,",
    "the number density of igcs would be very small , and also might follow the galaxy cluster mass distribution .    from a galaxy formation point of view",
    ", as gcs are thought to be among the oldest objects in the universe , they provide useful information about the galaxy formation and evolution processes . by studying a globular cluster system ( gcs ) associated with a single galaxy ,",
    "the history of the host galaxy is probed .",
    "the hypothesis of the existence of an igc population has been used to gain insight into the high-@xmath5 problem .",
    "@xcite argued that a high value of @xmath5 in galaxies located near the centers of galaxy clusters is the result of the accretion of a number of igcs .",
    "they assumed that an igc population exists in all galaxy clusters , and that the number density of igcs is concentrated toward the center of the galaxy cluster .",
    "recently , @xcite did a dynamical analysis of the gcs associated with m87 .",
    "they concluded that the metal - rich gcs of m87 formed with the galaxy , and that the metal - poor gcs are gradually accreting onto m87 along virgo s principal axis .",
    "this could therefore be an example of how the accretion of igcs would influence the galaxy s evolutionary history .",
    "although some authors consider that the accretion of igcs is capable of modifying the properties of the gcs of a galaxy , there are a number of others that defend the view that the greater part of a gcs is formed in situ from the protogalactic cloud @xcite .",
    "so the possible influence of the accretion of igcs in galaxy formation and evolutionary models is still an open issue . in this context , the existence or not of igcs and , if they do exist , their abundance and distribution become crucial ingredients in the development of a unified galaxy evolution scenario .",
    "even though the existence of igcs is often assumed , there is little evidence to date to prove this .",
    "do gcs form only during starbursts in galaxies or can they form in isolation ? if igcs exist in all galaxy clusters , their number and spatial distribution are fundamental pieces of information for testing the different gc formation models .",
    "furthermore , the influence of igcs in the evolution of elliptical galaxies is still not clear .",
    "is accretion of igcs important during the galaxy s formation and evolutionary history ?",
    "if this is the case , is it important for all elliptical galaxies , or only for those located in some privileged locations inside galaxy clusters ? in this paper the existence of an igc population in the coma galaxy cluster has been tested and quantified using the surface - brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) technique .",
    "our purpose is to obtain information about the igc population from the study of the unresolved point sources by means of sbf analysis .",
    "the measured sbf signal is produced mainly by faint galaxies and the igc population ( if such a thing exists ) .",
    "for this reason , during sbf measurements , a good characterization of the faint end of the background differential galaxy number counts , @xmath6 , is fundamental .",
    "a number of authors have measured the slope of the faint end of @xmath6 in the @xmath7 filter .",
    "results range from @xmath8 @xcite to @xmath9 = 0.3134 @xcite .",
    "this slope has also been measured in the hubble deep field @xcite , with @xmath10 for the @xmath11 filter and @xmath12 for the @xmath13 filter down to magnitude 26 .",
    "for the intermediate @xmath7 filter , the slope must be between @xmath12 and 0.36 . from the sbf analysis presented in this paper ,",
    "we provide not only information about the existence or not of an igc population , but also an estimate of the slope of the faint end of @xmath6 .",
    "observations of the 16 giant elliptical galaxies and the 4  blank \" regions studied in this paper were done on 2000 april 25 and 27 , with the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) at the roque de los muchachos observatory ( la palma ) , using the wide field camera and the sloan @xmath7 filter .",
    "this work is based on the results obtained by @xcite , where the observations , photometric calibration and data reduction procedures are described in detail , as well as the sbf analysis .",
    "we provide here only a short outline of the latter .",
    "the concept of sbf was introduced by @xcite , who noted that , in the surface photometry of a galaxy too far to be resolved , a pixel - to - pixel fluctuation is observed due to the poisson statistics of the spatial distribution of stars , gcs , background galaxies , etc .",
    "the variance of the fluctuation depends on the stellar population , the gcs , background galaxies , foreground stars , and , of course , the distance .",
    "it can be assumed that the total pixel - to - pixel variance of an image is the sum of all the independent contributions .",
    "the sbf technique involves spectral analysis of the signal and provides as a result the total psf - convolved variance ( @xmath14 ) , produced by all objects whose spatial flux distribution is convolved with the psf : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the variances produced by the stellar populations , gcs , background galaxies , and foreground stars , respectively .",
    "if a population of igcs is being analyzed , @xmath16 can be neglected , and hence @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the pixel - to - pixel variance produced by the igc population where this exists .    the pixel - to - pixel variance produced by a class of object",
    "can be evaluated as the second moment of the differential number counts of that object population . in this way",
    ", @xmath18 can be obtained from the background @xmath6 , fitted to the resolved point sources , and @xmath19 from the predicted star counts , computed making use of a galaxy model .",
    "once @xmath18 and @xmath19 are estimated and @xmath14 is measured , @xmath22 can be easily obtained from equation  [ p0 ] .",
    "note that in coma , gcs can not be directly resolved from ground - based observations ( except the brightest individuals ) , so , in order to determine the surface number density of igcs , sbf analysis becomes necessary .",
    "the surface number density of igcs ( @xmath0 ) can be estimated from @xmath22 assuming a fixed gc luminosity function ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "a fixed @xmath23 provides a fixed @xmath24 ratio that can be used to transform variances into surface densities .",
    "this ratio depends on the photometric calibration .",
    "marn - franch & aparicio s ( 2002 ) results used here are listed in table [ igc ] .",
    "the name of the region studied is listed in column 1 . in column 2 , the distance to the coma galaxy cluster center is also shown .",
    "finally , the obtained @xmath14 in the outer region of each galaxy ( the region further away from the galactic center , where galactic gcs no longer exist ) and in the  blank \" areas are listed in column 3 .",
    "the following discussion is based on these results .",
    "let us consider regions close to the studied galaxies , but beyond the galactic halos .",
    "if igcs existed then @xmath21 would be @xmath25 @xmath14 is measured from sbf analysis .",
    "but , in order to obtain @xmath0 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 must be deduced first .",
    "coma is in a nearly perpendicular direction to the galactic plane , so the expected number of foreground stars is very low and its contribution to the background variance is negligible when compared with the variance produced by the gcss of the coma galaxies @xcite .",
    "but foreground stars can produce a significant contribution to the total variance in intergalactic regions , so they must be considered if the variance produced by igcs and the faint end of @xmath6 is to be analyzed .",
    "@xcite computed the predicted star counts in selected fields and photometric bands using their model for the galaxy .",
    "in particular , they computed the predicted star counts in the northern galactic pole in the @xmath7 filter down to magnitude 26.5 ( fig .",
    "[ stars ] ) . by computing the second moment of these star counts",
    ", @xmath28 can be obtained for the north galactic pole .",
    "the result is @xmath29 assuming a @xmath30 uncertainty for the star counts model predictions . as coma is very close to the north galactic pole",
    ", we adopt this value and assume that it is constant over coma .",
    "the background galaxy variance , @xmath31 , has to be obtained from the differential galaxy number counts , @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite obtained a slope of @xmath8 for the faint end of @xmath6 in filter @xmath7 .",
    "more recently , @xcite obtained slopes in the range @xmath9 = 0.300.34 , also in @xmath7 .",
    "unfortunately , the adopted value of @xmath9 has considerable effects in the resulting @xmath0 .",
    "for this reason , we have evaluated @xmath0 considering three values for the @xmath6 slope , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath8 , and has analyzed the results separately .",
    "the corresponding zero points of @xmath6 have been obtained from fits to the resolved point sources measured by @xcite in which the slope is a fixed parameter .    as an example ,",
    "@xmath6 values are shown in fig .",
    "[ bglf ] for the three slopes @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath8 overplotted on the resolved point sources in region `` blank 3 '' .",
    "it can be seen that the three values of @xmath9 are in principle compatible with the resolved galaxy distribution in this region",
    ".    the variance @xmath26 can be now deduced as the second moment of @xmath6 , and @xmath21 can be obtained from equation  [ sigmaigc ] . in table",
    "[ igc ] , and for each value of @xmath9 , the results associated with each galaxy for @xmath26 are listed in column 4 .",
    "the error bars of @xmath26 have been computed taking into account only the @xmath6 fitting uncertainty .",
    "note that in @xcite the error bar of @xmath26 was determined considering possible variations in the slope of the faint end of the @xmath6 ( from @xmath32 to @xmath34 ) , but in the present study , these possible variations are being considered explicitly by studying the cases @xmath32 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 separately .",
    "equation [ sigmaigc ] can now be used to derive @xmath21 for each region .",
    "the results are given in column 5 of table [ igc ] .",
    "the number population of igc , @xmath0 , can be estimated from @xmath21 using the @xmath24 ratios listed column 6 .",
    "these ratios were computed in @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 is listed in column 7 .",
    "note that @xmath0 is expresed in @xmath37 , while the rest of columns are expresed in @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath21 uncertainties have been computed adding in quadrature the uncertainties of @xmath14 and @xmath31 . on the other hand ,",
    "the uncertainties of the ratio @xmath24 have been neglected .",
    "the reason is that @xmath23 is assumed to be universal ( we assume the same @xmath23 parameters adopted in marn - franch & aparicio 2002 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) . in this sense",
    ", the uncertainty in the @xmath23 parameters would introduce a rescaling factor common to all the results , but the relative errors would not change and the proofs of igcs detection would remain valid .",
    "the origin of the galaxy - to - galaxy variations in the ratio @xmath24 relies on the differences of the photometric calibration constants .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath0 for the field regions associated with the 16 galaxies studied in @xcite ( dots ) and for four additional intergalactic field regions ( stars ) are plotted in fig .",
    "[ gamma ] versus the distance @xmath7 to the coma galaxy cluster center .",
    "each panel corresponds to a value of @xmath9 .",
    "regions associated with galaxies were selected in @xcite with the aim of sampling the background .",
    "they are beyond the gcs of each galaxy and they consequently sample the intergalactic field population .",
    "the four intergalactic `` blank '' regions are far from any galaxy . the fact that the average of @xmath0 for these regions is the same as for the regions associated with galaxies confirms that the field is really being sampled in both cases .    the most significant characteristic of the plots in fig .",
    "[ gamma ] is the flat distributions of values .",
    "the only point perhaps departing from this trend is that associated with the central galaxy , ngc 4874 .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen that @xmath0 is negative in almost all cases for @xmath8 , indicating that this value is unlikely . on the other hand , if @xmath32 , then @xmath0 is clearly a positive number , implying that an igc population should exist .",
    "this population is also detected if @xmath33 , but less clearly .",
    "it should be noted that , if @xmath9 = 0.300.34 , @xmath0 does not correlate with @xmath7 , and hence with the environment , except for the fact that the density associated with the central galaxy is higher .",
    "rather , the igc population would be uniformly spread all over coma .",
    "we will discuss this issue further in section  4 .    for each value of @xmath9 ,",
    "we have computed the average @xmath41 in coma using all but the central points .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ meanigc ] and have been plotted in fig .",
    "[ gamma ] by dashed lines .",
    "dotted lines show the 1 @xmath42 intervals ( @xmath42 is the root mean square of the data point distribution ) .",
    "the estimated errors of the mean have also been computed using the usual formula @xmath43 and are the errors quoted in table  [ meanigc ] .",
    "the extreme cases considered above for the @xmath6 slope , @xmath32 and @xmath8 , characterize two distinct scenarios .",
    "we have seen that the latter produces negative @xmath0 all over coma , which indicates that @xmath6 must be shallower .",
    "let us consider now in more detail the possibility @xmath32 . in this case , fig .",
    "[ gamma ] shows that igcs would exist and would be spread all over coma .",
    "furthermore , no relation with the distance to the galaxy cluster center is apparent .",
    "however , all the gc formation scenarios mentioned in  [ intro ] imply that @xmath0 should follow the galaxy cluster mass distribution . assuming this and in order to test our results",
    ", we will consider three different galaxy cluster simplistic mass distributions , @xmath44 , and analyze the expected @xmath0 distribution for each model .",
    "@xcite has given for coma a cut - off radius @xmath45 , a core radius @xmath46 ( i.e. @xmath47 ) and , using @xmath48 km s@xmath49 mpc@xmath49 @xcite for the hubble parameter , a total mass @xmath50 .",
    "this value for the hubble parameter corresponds to a distance of 97.2 mpc and to @xmath51 mpc and @xmath52 mpc . in this context , the three considered galaxy cluster mass distribution models correspond to a king model , a homogeneous sphere of radius equal to the cut - off radius of coma ( @xmath53 ) and a homogeneous sphere of radius equal to twice the cut - off radius of coma .",
    "all them are plotted in the upper panel of figure [ massdis ] .",
    "all the mass distributions are normalized to a total galaxy cluster mass of @xmath54 @xcite",
    ". the vertical solid line represents the coma cut - off radius , @xmath55 .",
    "once a mass distribution model is assumed , the expected @xmath0 can be deduced projecting the galaxy cluster spatial mass distribution and taking into account a gc formation efficiency .",
    "the latter is a measure of the fraction of mass converted into gcs . @xcite",
    "defined the gc formation efficiency in galaxies as @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are the mass densities of gcs , gas , and stars in the galaxy , respectively .",
    "@xcite found this definition of @xmath60 to be universal from galaxy to galaxy and equal to @xmath61 .",
    "we will use here a similar definition for the intergalactic medium that , for convenience , we define in terms of surface density : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the surface mass density of igcs and @xmath64 is the baryonic surface mass density of the galaxy cluster obtained projecting @xmath44 .",
    "the relation between the baryonic surface mass density and the igc surface number density is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the mean mass of a gc .",
    "assuming @xmath67 @xcite , the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ massdis ] shows @xmath68 as a function of @xmath7 for the three mass distribution models plotted in the upper panel .",
    "this figure shows that the baryonic mass distribution model required to produce an approximately constant , non - null , @xmath0 distribution along coma ( up to @xmath69 , at least ) should be similar to a very extended homogeneous sphere .",
    "the unrealistic nature of this model indicates that a value as low as @xmath32 for the slope of the faint end of @xmath6 is unlikely .",
    "moreover , it suggests that the igc surface density , @xmath0 , is actually zero all over coma , with the probable exception of the surroundings of the central galaxy",
    ". the value of @xmath9 that reduces the mean @xmath70 to zero ( excluding the central value ) can be calculated from interpolation in the data listed in table  [ meanigc ] and turns out to be @xmath3 .",
    "the former is the slope of @xmath6 beyond the detection limit of @xmath71 reached by @xcite and @xcite and is valid at least down to the @xmath7 magnitude significantly contributing to the sbf .",
    "this magnitude can be evaluated by considering that in table  [ igc ] the error bars associated with @xmath31 are , on average , about 5% .",
    "if @xmath31 is computed for different limiting magnitudes , it is found that the variance produced by background galaxies fainter than @xmath4 is lower than this value of 5% . the signal produced by fainter galaxies remains below the error bars . in conclusion , @xmath4 can be assumed the faintest limit of our determination , so that the slope of the faint end of @xmath6 is @xmath3 ( this slope is valid down to @xmath4 at least ) .    for comparison , it is interesting to note that @xcite have measured the slope of @xmath6 for deeper @xmath11 and @xmath13 magnitudes from the hubble deep field .",
    "they obtain @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 for the magnitude interval [ 23,26 ] , and @xmath72 for @xmath11 and @xmath73 for @xmath13 for the magnitude interval [ 26,29 ] .",
    "in  4.1 we concluded that the most likely value for the general igc density in coma is zero , and that this is accomplished with a slope @xmath74 for the faint end of the background differential galaxy number counts , @xmath6 .",
    "we will now further discuss the implications of these results on the igc population and the overall baryonic mass distribution in coma .    in fig .",
    "[ massdis2 ] , @xmath0 obtained with @xmath10 is plotted as a function of @xmath7 , the distance to the coma center .",
    "the points have been computed as an interpolation between the @xmath33 and @xmath8 results listed in table [ igc ] .",
    "it can be seen that the mean @xmath70 is zero , as required . only ngc  4874 seems to be surrounded by a significant number of igcs . a king model , such as that plotted in fig .",
    "[ massdis ] , can now be compared with the igc distribution .",
    "the efficiency @xmath75 can be calibrated from the central igc density @xmath76 @xmath77 and is @xmath78 .",
    "incidentally , this value is two orders of magnitude smaller than that obtained by @xcite for gcs belonging to galaxies .",
    "the former @xmath75 and the concentration parameter @xmath47 derived by @xcite for the intergalactic matter in coma associated with the x - ray radiation can be used to plot the expected distribution of igcs .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ massdis2 ] , upper panel ( solid line ) .",
    "this would be the distribution of igc in coma if : ( i ) the x - ray emission properly samples the baryonic intergalactic mass distribution in coma ; ( ii ) the gc excess observed in the central region is caused by a genuine igc population bound by the general coma potential well , and ( iii ) if the efficiency @xmath79 is constant all over coma .",
    "this distribution lies beyond the error bars of several single @xmath0 values .",
    "a higher concentration parameter is required to properly fit the @xmath0 point distribution .",
    "the best fit to a king distribution produces @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the result has been plotted in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ massdis2 ] .",
    "the reduced chi - square for the best fit results @xmath82 which indicates that the fit is good enough . on the other hand , @xmath83 for the @xmath47 king model fit . for @xmath84 ( as in our case ) ,",
    "the integral probability of the @xmath85 distribution is 0.001 for @xmath86 , showing that the @xmath47 king model fit can be rejected with a high confidence level .",
    "the concentration parameter @xmath80 , implies a core radius of @xmath87 .",
    "this is of the order of , or smaller than , the size of the coma central galaxy ngc 4874 .",
    "in fact , in @xcite , the spatial structure of the ngc 4874 gcs was studied out to a distance of @xmath88 from the galaxy center , and its edge was probably not reached .",
    "this suggests that the obtained @xmath0 excess around the center of coma is produced by the outermost extension of the ngc 4874 primitive gcs rather than being a trace of an igc system . in other words , the spatial distribution of @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ massdis2 ] is probably the map of the ngc  4874 gcs .",
    "this result suggests that an igc population does not exist in coma .",
    "this points toward gcs having been formed only , or almost only , from protogalactic clouds .",
    "none of them , or perhaps very few , could have formed in isolated regions .",
    "this is in good agreement with the in situ formation scenario for the gcss @xcite .",
    "if the distribution of igcs followed the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters @xcite , it would be reasonable to expect that @xmath0 would show a spatially extended gradient across de galaxy cluster .",
    "this not being the case , it seems inappropriate to support the relationship between igc and dark matter distributions , although it is true that the relationship could still exist but not be strong enough to be detected .    on the other hand ,",
    "a number of authors have argued that accretion of igcs might influence the formation and evolution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that accretion of igcs is not a significant effect in galaxy formation and evolutionary processes in the coma galaxies , since our conclusion is that igcs do not exist in coma .",
    "@xcite found the existence of three subgroups of galaxies in coma , one of them associated with the cd galaxy ngc 4874 and the other two with ngc  4889 and ngc  4839 .",
    "they conclude that the non - stationarity of the dynamical processes at work in the coma core is due to the merging of small - scale groups of galaxies . in this context , each subgroup formed separately and then the merger between the different groups took place . in @xcite , five galaxies belonging to the @xcite subgroup 1 ( the ngc 4874 group ) were analyzed showing that a relation between @xmath5 and the distance to the central galaxy ngc 4874 was compatible with the data .",
    "the possibility of accretion of igcs being responsible for this relation was discussed . in the light of our new results and owing to the absence of igcs found here , this possibility should be also rejected .",
    "the existence of an igc population in the coma galaxy cluster has been tested using the sbf .",
    "the measured sbf signal is mainly produced by faint galaxies and the igc population ( if it exists ) .",
    "for this reason , the @xmath0 results reached and the @xmath6 faint end are connected .",
    "as we do not have a precise enough measurement of @xmath6 in the coma galaxy cluster , @xmath0 has been obtained considering three different values for the @xmath6 slope ( @xmath32 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ) and the results have been analyzed separately .",
