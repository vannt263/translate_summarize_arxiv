    "superfluid helium-4 is a typical boson fluid to occur in nature and bose condensation is believed to be the fundamental reason for such a phenomenon . recently ,",
    "superfluidity of liquid helium-4 in highly connected porous structures ( vycor glass , glass plate , xerogel , aerogel , graphite , fine powders , steel , german silver , plastic films , _",
    "etc_. ) has been observed and studied intensively .",
    "@xcite however , so far no satisfactory explanation of experimental observations on these materials has been achieved .",
    "@xcite since porous media can be treated as solids with fractal or non - integer dimensions , @xcite we believe that it is imperative to study the extent of the dimensionality contribution to the superfluidity in order to understand the experimental results .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the physical properties of ideal bose gas with fractal dimensions between @xmath0 ( thin film limit ) and @xmath1 ( the bulk limit ) .",
    "the results will be compared with experimental results obtained from liquid helium-4 in porous media .",
    "surprisingly , we find that most of salient features of experimental observations on liquid helium-4 in porous solids can be explained using the theoretical results from the ideal gas model in fractal dimensions .",
    "this indicates that the dimensionality contribution , not the mutual interactions , is the dominant factor for superfluidity in porous media .",
    "the ideal bose gas system at integer dimensions was studied long time ago.@xcite however , study at fractal dimensions was carried out only quite recently.@xcite the density of states which is essential to calculate thermodynamic properties of the bose gas in @xmath2-dimension , where @xmath2 is any real number , is given by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the @xmath2-dimensional coefficient which is known as @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the gamma function , @xmath7 the mass , and @xmath8 the @xmath2-dimensional _ measure _ or volume .    in order to obtain physical quantities of the @xmath2-dimensional bose gas , it is necessary to obtain the grand partition function in @xmath2-dimension , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the thermodynamic fugacity defined by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the thermal wavelength defined by @xmath14 . with the coefficient @xmath4 , we can readily calculate the grand partition function in @xmath2-dimension .",
    "the @xmath15 is the bose gas function defined by @xmath16 the coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath10 are restricted to @xmath18 and @xmath19 regions .",
    "the bose gas function can be also extended to non - integer dimensions,@xcite and has an integral expression , @xmath20 note that this representation is valid only when @xmath21 .    using the above expressions",
    ", we obtain the average number of particles in @xmath2-dimension , @xmath22 we use the above equations to calculate thermodynamic properties in fractal dimensions in the following .",
    "before we go into detailed calculations , we briefly summarize experimental findings on superfluid helium-4 in porous media , since we are interested in whether the dimensionality considered above plays any role in real situations .",
    "it is known that physical properties of superfluid helium-4 in porous media show quite puzzling behaviors . @xcite upon reducing the lab variables of porous media such as  pore filling , \"  thickness , \"  number of layers , \" or ",
    "coverage , \" the capacity curves show the following generic behaviors independent of the porous media or substrates : ( i ) the critical temperature for superfluidity onset shifts downwards almost linearly .",
    "( ii ) the bulk - like sharp cusp disappears and the peak gets smaller .",
    "furthermore , there appears a systematic crossing at low temperatures .",
    "( iii ) the shape of the curve gets rounder and , eventually , becomes flat .",
    "these experimental findings are summarized in fig .",
    "these figures are reproduced from references [ 1 - 4 ] , so that comparison with the theory can be made transparent . here",
    ", we observe that the above experimental findings appear independent of detailed nature of porous media and also of interactions between particles .",
    "this fact strongly suggests that , at least , the qualitative nature of the above behavior may originate from geometric factors .",
    "( iv ) another interesting physical property is the superfluid density shown in fig .",
    "2 . the sample e has smaller density , which implies more connectivity of porous structure than the sample",
    "it is shown that the curves from different media do not cross one another .",
    "this again indicates that the superfluid density is strongly dependent on the porous structure .",
    "numerous theories have been suggested to explain the above experimental observations .",
    "@xcite however , so far no completely successful theory has emerged .",
    "for example , the kt model of the vortex mediated transition in two - dimensional space gives an excellent explanation of question ( i ) for very thin films of one or two layers but not for other samples .",
    "we now calculate the physical properties in fractal dimensions and compare the results with the experimental findings summarized above .",
    "fractal dimensionality measures disorderness in terms of the connectivity of the system .",
    "\\(i ) the critical temperature , @xmath23 , for the superfluidity of the ideal bose gas in fractal space can readily obtained from eq .",

    "necessary parameters are taken from reference 25 .",
    "the formula can be simplified when @xmath2 approaches to 2 to be given by @xcite @xmath25 the results are surprisingly in good agreement with the experimental findings shown in fig .",
    "1 . even though we completely neglected the interactions between bose particles , the @xmath26 limit has the same form with the kt theory prediction.@xcite note that the kt theory can not account the experimental results for thick films , but the present @xmath27 limit agrees with the correct bulk value .",
    "\\(ii ) the specific heat of the ideal bose gas in fractal space can readily obtained , too , from the grand partition function @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "( a ) when @xmath29 @xmath30 and , ( b ) when @xmath31 @xmath32 the @xmath33 curves for several values of fractal dimensions are plotted as functions of temperatures in fig .",
    "we observe that the cusp disappears when the dimension is less than 3 , and the peak height becomes smaller with decreasing dimensionality .",
    "also , fig .",
    "4 shows that there exists a systematic crossover at low temperature regions .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with the experiments shown in fig",
    "\\(iii ) in fig .",
    "4 , we observe that the peaks of the specific heat curves become less and less prominent and , eventually , the curves become flat with decreasing dimensionality .",
    "we show that this behavior originates from a hidden hierarchy in the superfluidity transition with fractal dimensions .",

    "the curves again show the shift of @xmath23 with decreasing dimensionality .",
    "also , it is shown that the discontinuity of @xmath37 disappears with decreasing dimensionality . in order to investigate this behavior",
    "more closely , we studied the relation between the continuity of higher derivatives of @xmath36 and the fractional dimensionality .",
    "taking higher derivatives on @xmath36 and considering the behavior at @xmath23 , we obtain the following relation : @xmath38 = \\lim_{\\eta \\rightarrow 0 }     \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{nj } \\ , \\eta ^{j+2-\\frac{(j+1)d}{2 } } ,   \\label{crt}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath39 are finite constants , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the specific heats below and above @xmath23 .",
    "this formula can also be proved by mathematical induction method ( see appendix ) .",
    "the hierarchy of the superfluidity transition with the fractal dimensionality obtained from the above formula is summarized at table 1 .",
    "this table explains the physical origin of the roundness tendency of the specific heat curves with decreasing the dimensionality .",
    "\\(iv ) in real system the superfluid fraction is different from the condensate fraction , but the structure of the condensate fraction may shed some clue for the superfluid fraction .",
    "the condensate fraction in @xmath2-dimension can readily be obtained from eqs .",

    "it is shown that the curves with higher dimensions have higher @xmath23 and the curves do not cross each other . the fig .",
    "6 gives the information that the sample e has a higher fractal dimension than the sample f in fig .",
    "also , the aerogel has the highest fractal dimension , the xerogel is the next , and the vycor has the lowest one in fig .",
    "of course , they are all less than the bulk value of @xmath43 .",
    "the qualitative features of the theoretical curves are in excellent agreement with the experimental results in fig .",
    "even the tail structure at @xmath44 is reproduced .",
    "physical properties of the ideal bose gas in fractal dimensions are studied theoretically .",
    "the results are compared with the experimental findings from the superfluid helium-4 in porous media .",
    "it is found that the main characteristics of the experimental results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical results obtained from the simple ideal bose gas in fractal dimensions . such a good agreement may not be totally unexpected .",
    "careful examination of the experimental results reveals that the salient features are independent of materials and mutual interactions , thus suggesting that the dominant contributions should come from geometrical factors .",
    "another important point of the theoretical study is the existence of a hierarchy of the superfluidity transitions with changing fractal dimensionality .",
    "the peak of heat capacity is not necessary for the superfluid transition in porous media",
