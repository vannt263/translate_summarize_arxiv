    "spontaneous random molecular fluctuations play a significant role in the driving kinetic mechanism of many regulatory enzymatic reactions .",
    "random fluctuations in genetic networks are inevitable as chemical reactions are probabilistic and many genes , rnas and proteins are present in low numbers per cell .",
    "gene expressions , for example , involves a series of single - molecule events subject to significant thermal fluctuations , which may result in a divergence of fate and lead to non - genetic population heterogeneity",
    ". moreover , mean levels of heterogeneity for the populations are ensured by regulatory factors that tune the spontaneous fluctuations .",
    "although many examples of potentially noise - exploiting cellular processes have been discussed and documented in literature , how cells function and process information when the underlying molecular events are random still remains an open question  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "other cellular processes influenced by noise include ion - channel gating , neural firing , cytoskeleton dynamics and molecular motors  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "simulation schemes that model each individual reaction event can be computationally demanding @xcite as the copy of the input and output molecules increases .",
    "therefore , as an alternative way to account for molecular fluctuations in biochemical reactions is to assume that the time evolution of a species of interest is produced at an average rate @xmath0 , degraded at rate @xmath1 and follows the stochastic differential equation :    @xmath2    in the above equation the noise term is appended as the additive ( white ) noise source @xmath3 weakly perturbing deterministic evolution of the system .",
    "obviously , implicit for such a formulation is a continuous description of molecular species where the dynamics is cast in terms of infinitesimal changes of concentrations .",
    "( [ eq : lang ] ) will be further postulated to study dynamics of a catalytic reaction .",
    "we consider the phenomenological michaelis - menten scheme for the catalysis accompanying a spontaneous replication of molecules @xmath4 where a substrate @xmath5 forms first a complex @xmath6 with molecules of the enzyme @xmath7 , before the conversion of @xmath5 to a product @xmath8 is completed . by assuming that the production of @xmath5-type molecules inhibited by a hyperbolic activation ( michaelis - menten inhibition kinetics ) is the slowest process under consideration and by considering a conserved mass of enzymes @xmath9",

    "it reduces the model complexity by effectively reducing the number of considered molecular species and reactions .",
    "+ in the case of michaelis - menten kinetics this approximation assumes also much larger concentration of substrate @xmath5 than the enzyme concentration @xmath15 and with the steady - state constraint @xmath16 leads to a characteristic regulatory term @xmath17 in the dynamic ( [ lang ] ) . the resulting potential profile eq.([profile ] ) has at most three extrema representing deterministic stationary states of the system ( see fig .  [",

    "most of tumoral cells bear antigens which are recognized as strange by the immune system . a response against these antigens",
    "may be mediated either by immune cells such as t - lymphocytes or other cells , not directly related to the immune system ( like macrophages or natural killer cells ) .",
    "the process of damage to tumor proceeds via infiltration of the latter by the specialized cells which subsequently develop a cytotoxic activity against the cancer cell - population .",
    "the series of cytotoxic reactions between the cytotoxic cells and the tumor tissue may be considered to be well approximated by a saturating , enzymatic - like process whose time evolution equations are similar to the standard michaelis - menten kinetics .",
    "the variability of kinetic parameters defining this process naturally affects the extinction of the tumor @xcite .",
    "the process of population growth and decay can be described as a motion of a fictitious particle in a potential @xmath11 , whose shape varies in time due the noisy @xmath20 parameter .",
    "minima of the potential correspond to stable states of the population , where , in case of a purely deterministic system , the cell concentration does not grow or decay .",
    "one of the minima is always at @xmath21 , which reflects the fact that the state in which cancer cells are absent is a stable one .",
    "the other minimum corresponds to a fixed - size cell population .",
    "noise - induced transition between those stable states across the potential barrier may be interpreted as a `` spontaneous '' extinction of cancer due to environmental fluctuations , as well as due to random variations in the immune response efficiency .",
    "we will study a system with parameters chosen in such a way that @xmath21 is a global minimum .",
    "we are interested in the lifetime of the metastable state .",
    "mean escape time has been intensively studied in order to characterize the lifetime of metastable states of static and fluctuating potentials with different initial conditions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the studies show that the mean escape time has different non - monotonic behaviors as a function of both the thermal noise intensity and the mean frequency of potential fluctuations .",
    "these behaviors are a signature of two noise - induced effects , namely the resonant activation ( ra ) @xcite-@xcite and the noise enhanced stability ( nes ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the nes effect increases the average lifetime of the metastable state , while the ra phenomenon minimizes this lifetime .",
    "the purpose of this work is to find the optimal range of parameters in which the positive role of resonant activation phenomenon , with respect to the cancer extinction , prevails over the negative role of nes , which enhances the stability of the tumoral state .",
    "the following section explains more extensively the concepts of resonant activation and noise - enhanced stability and their role in the analysis of cancer growth kinetics . in the next section",
    "we report the appearance of ra and nes phenomena in this model and we discuss the statistics of first passage times in this regime . in the same section",
    "the role of different potential profiles on the ra and nes effects , with piece - wise linear and mm potentials with reflecting boundary is analyzed .",
    "finally we draw the conclusions .",
    "our starting point is the following langevin equation of an overdamped brownian particle moving in a random fluctuating potential barrier @xmath22    here @xmath3 is a gaussian process with zero mean and correlation function @xmath23 .",

    "the nonmonotonic behavior of the mean escape time as a function of the additive noise intensity @xmath61 depends on the potential profile parameters , on the parameters of the multiplicative dichotomous noise and also on the initial position of the brownian particle  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "noise enhances the stability of the metastable state with different peculiarities related to different dynamical regimes : the average lifetime can greatly increase when the noise intensity is very low with respect to the height of the barrier and the initial positions of the brownian particles are in the  divergent \" dynamical regime  @xcite .",
    "when the particle starts from initial positions within the potential well , at small values of @xmath61 with respect the height of the potential barrier and for a fixed potential , it will follow the monotonic behavior of the kramers formula , as a function of the noise intensity .",
    "the mean escape time will then tend to infinity for @xmath62 .",

    "[ fig : mmapprox]a .",
    "the reflecting barrier placed in the proximity of the metastable state pushes the particle away from it and therefore decreases the mfpt for all values of the noise intensity , producing an overall reduction of the nes effect .",
    "the brownian particle experiences only two different slopes in the piece - wise linear potential , while more slopes are experienced , and therefore more time spent around the metastable state , in the mm potential  @xcite .",
    "this explain why the piece - wise linear potential is the worst approximation . for noise intensity values greater than the height of the potential barrier ,",
    "the different shape of the potential profile becomes irrelevant and the decreasing of mfpt values is due to the reflecting boundary only . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mmapprox]b is reported the mfpt as a function of the correlation time of the multiplicative noise , at a fixed value of the noise intensity , for the same different potential profiles .",
    "the effect of the reflecting boundary is again to decrease all the mfpt values in the mm potential and therefore to reduce the absolute values of the ra phenomenon .",
    "the minimum of mfpt is of course more pronounced in the exact mm potential and the piece - wise linear potential is again the worst approximation .",
    "both effects are robust enough to be observed in different potential profiles .      in this section",
    "we look for the coexistence region of ra and nes effects .",

    "the results reported here are an extension of those presented in @xcite .",
    "the results confirm the existence of resonant activation and noise - enhanced stability phenomena in the studied system .",

    "the considerations of subsection  [ subsec : ra ] are valid not only for trajectories starting from inside the potential well , but also for arbitrary initial positions in the potential , if only the particle has a chance to be trapped behind the potential barrier for some time .",
    "if the additive noise intensity is very large , a particle starting from the outer slope of the barrier does not  feel \" the barrier at all . if , in turn , the additive noise is very weak , the particle slides down the slope in an almost deterministic way .",
    "but at intermediate values of @xmath61 , the particle can ( in some , very infrequent , realizations of the stochastic process ) be trapped behind the barrier and , in case of such a rare event , its escape time changes non - monotonically as a function of @xmath50 , in a way described in subsection  [ subsec : ra ] .",
    "this effect of coexistence of noise - enhanced stability and resonant activation effects can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d_3.65 ] .",
    "when the trajectory starts on the outer slope of the potential , only small fraction of the realizations are trapped into the well , and thus the ra effect is very small because only few trajectories will contribute to it . in order to obtain a well - visible ra ( a large enough number of trapped trajectories ) we have to choose the initial position sufficiently close to the top of @xmath43 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath82 .",
    "for this initial position we observe a co - occurence of nes and ra .",
    "since both effects act here in an opposite way , there exists a regime of @xmath61 and @xmath50 parameters where noise - enhanced stability is strongly reduced by resonant activation .",
    "this region is well visible in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d_3.65 ] for values of parameters : @xmath86 , @xmath87 . in fig .",

    "most trajectories ( more than @xmath88 of all ) are those which do not fall into the potential well .",
    "the trajectories trapped are minor contibutions : their fraction ( of order of @xmath89 , @xmath90 and even @xmath91 ) depends on the barrier switching rate and on the additive noise strength . at @xmath92 ,",
    "the first passage times of particles , which had not been trapped into the well , are of order of @xmath93 .",
    "the first passage times of the trajectories trapped behind the potential barrier depend of course on @xmath50 : in the region where the resonant activation is better visible , for small @xmath50 the first passage times are of order of @xmath94 , for large @xmath50 they are of order of @xmath95 and more , and for the intermediate values of @xmath50 the first passage time drops down to the order of @xmath96 .",
    "we studied a langevin equation derived from the phenomenological michaelis - menten scheme for catalysis accompanying a spontaneous replication of molecules .",
    "it contains an additive noise term ( gaussian white noise ) and a multiplicative noisy driving ( dichotomous noise ) in the term responsible for inhibition of population growth .",
    "the models of that type are widely used in biophysical description of cell - mediated immune surveillance against cancer @xcite , analysis of cell survival including repair kinetics after exposure to ionizing radiation @xcite or delineation of factors responsible for the efficient action of biological regulatory networks @xcite .",
    "we examined how the two different sources of noise influence the population s extinction time , identified with the mean first passage time of the system over the zero population state .",
    "we observe appearance of two noise - induced resonant phenomena in the system : mean first passage time displays here a non - monotonic behavior which depends on the characteristic parameters of the noises present in the system , namely the additive noise intensity @xmath61 and the correlation time @xmath50 of the multiplicative noise .",
    "the occurence of a minimum in mfpt ( resonant activation ) is related to the @xmath50 parameter , whereas the emergence of the maximum in mfpt ( noise - enhanced stability ) is connected with @xmath61 .",
    "we report the evidence for co - occurrence of resonant activation and noise - enhanced stability in the same regime of noise parameters .",
    "we observe that the strong stability enhancement of the metastable state comes from very few contributions from the trajectories trapped in it .",
    "their first passage times are several orders of magnitude longer than the first passage times of the trajectories which approached the absorbing boundary without being trapped in the metastable state .",
    "we analyzed the role of different potential profiles , with a reflecting barrier , on ra and nes phenomena .",
    "we found a very interesting , from the point of view of growth kinetics of cancer cells , coexistence region of both effects . in this region the nes effect , which enhances the stability of the tumoral state ,",
    "is strongly reduced by the ra effect , which enhances the cancer extinction . in other words , an asymptotic regression to the zero tumor size",
