    "ex  lupi , the prototype of the class of the eruptive pre - main sequence stars called exors , underwent its largest outburst recorded in the past 50 years in early 2008 ( history of the observations of ex  lupi and exors : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observational definition of exor variables relies strongly on the prototype ex  lupi , which spectroscopically looks like a classical t  tauri star in the quiescent phase @xcite , but flares by 13 magnitudes in the visible roughly once a decade , with each outbreak lasting about a year @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic behavior in the outburst is complicated , and sometimes related to an expanding stellar shell ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is increasingly accepted , however , that the circumstellar disk plays the primary role in the outbursts , in which mass accreted from the envelope is stalled somewhere in the disk , until it reaches a critical surface density and triggers a disk instability .        the idea that exor outbursts arise inside the accretion disk originates in their observational similarity with fuors . the most compelling evidence that the fuor outburst has its origin in a disk is the split absorption lines in the visible to the near - infrared with wavelength separation of two absorption peaks gradually decreasing with the wavelength @xcite .",
    "this is most naturally accounted for when the absorption lines at long wavelengths arise from the cool outer part of the disk , where the orbital velocity is slower ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "fuors and exors are historically considered as different classes of eruptive pre - main sequence stars . however",
    ", both classes may represent a similar eruptive event , and differ only quantitatively in terms of flare amplitude , outburst duration , and outburst frequency .",
    "recent outbursts of v1647  ori ( the central source of ",
    "mcneal s nebula  , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are recurrent like exors , yet the amplitude of the outburst is more compatible with fuors , which fills the gap between these two classes .",
    "the mass accreted in a single outburst and the frequency of the outbursts indicates that an exor / fuor star acquires a substantial fraction of its mass solely during the outbursts .",
    "it lends circumstantial support to the theory that exors / fuors are not a group of special variable stars , but a state of the accretion phase that stars commonly experience during their evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , there are indeed qualitative differences between fuors and normal t  tauri stars , such as the clustering nature , as fuors tend to be in isolation , while other t  tauri stars are in clusters @xcite .",
    "moreover , the number of known fuors in the orion nebula cluster falls short if all class  i sources go through the fuor phase with a finite duty cycle @xcite , although the number may increase with the inclusion of the `` fuor - like '' stars being identified recently @xcite .",
    "the current focus of exor studies is to understand ( 1 ) what is the mechanism of the disk instability , ( 2 ) what is the relationship between exors and fuors , and ( 3 ) what is the role of exor / fuor events in the context of star formation .    in this report",
    ", we will concentrate on the cause of the disk instability and the physical scale of the outburst , as it often gives a clue to the trigger of the instability . the most favored model to date , thermal instability in a disk ,",
    "is induced by ionization , and subsequent opacity increase due to negative hydrogen ions @xcite .",
    "the thermal instability is therefore only operational within a limited disk radius , where atomic hydrogen is subject to thermal ionization .",
    "if the physical size of the outburst is larger , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) instability may be favored , as it predicts a massive accretion in the magnetic dead zone at 110  au @xcite .",
    "if the outburst involves the whole disk , the scenario of an unseen companions leading to global disk instability may also work @xcite .",
    "the vibrational transitions of co are a unique probe of the inner regions of disks ( 0.011  au ) due to their high critical density ( @xmath4  @xmath5 ) and high excitation energy ( @xmath6  k ) .",
    "measurement of the location of the emitting gas is relatively straightforward under the assumption that the gas is in keplerian rotation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we utilized multi - epoch observations of co vibrational transitions in ex lupi to constrain where in the disk the hot gas is located during the outburst , and how its physical property develops with time .",
    "the present study is part of the first multi - wavelength campaign of ex  lupi from the optical @xcite , near - infrared @xcite to mid - infrared wavelengths @xcite during the 2008 eruption .",
    "we will use @xmath7  pc as the distance to ex  lupi from @xcite , and the stellar parameters from @xcite following @xcite ( table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of the co fundamental band were performed at the _ vlt _ and the subaru telescope over a total of 6 epochs ( figure  [ lc ] ) .",
    "half of the data were obtained in the director s discretionary time ( ddt ) on 14 , 17 , and 21 august 2008 at the _ vlt_. two wavelength intervals of the co fundamental band ( 4.664.77  @xmath0 m and 4.864.99  @xmath0 m with gaps between the four detector chips ) were observed with crires @xcite to cover the low [ @xmath8(1)@xmath8(11 ) ] and the high [ @xmath8(21)@xmath8(32 ) ] rotational transitions of v=1 - 0 in order to provide good constraints on the rotational excitation temperature of the hot gas .",

    "we conclude that the origin of the broad co emission is not the stellar photosphere or accretion columns , but the circumstellar disk .",
    "we will deconvolve the broad and the narrow emission components using a simple slab model in the next sections .",

    "<S> these emission lines appear exclusively in v=1 - 0 . </S>",
    "<S> the line widths translate to a characteristic orbiting radius of 0.4  au . </S>",
    "<S> the broad line component ( fwzi @xmath2 150  km  s@xmath1 ) is highly excited upto v@xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the line flux of the component decreases faster than the narrow line emission . </S>",
    "<S> simple modeling of the line profiles implies that the broad - line emitting gas is orbiting around the star at 0.040.4  au . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation state , the decay speed of the line flux , and the line profile , indicate that the broad - line emission component is physically distinct from the narrow - line emission component , and more tightly related to the outburst event . </S>"
