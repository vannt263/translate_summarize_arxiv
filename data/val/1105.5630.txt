    "@xmath18 becomes stable with respect to strong interaction , and must decay radiatively , or even weakly if the mass becomes lower than the threshold made of two pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "in constituent models with a flavor - independent central potential , the stability of @xmath26 configurations comes from a favorable effect when the charge - conjugation symmetry is broken , as noted many years ago @xcite .",
    "this is the same mechanism by which , in qed , the loosely bound positronium molecule evolves into the very stable hydrogen molecule .",
    "it is worth noting that in the large @xmath27 limit , the light degrees of freedom can not resolve the closely bound @xmath28 system .",
    "this results in bound states similar to the @xmath29 states , with @xmath28 playing the role of the heavy antiquark  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath26 states have been studied using a variety of simple or elaborated potential models @xcite .",
    "the corresponding four - body problem is very delicate .",
    "for instance , an expansion on harmonic - oscillator states was used in @xcite .",
    "it is efficient for deep binding but converges very slowly for weak binding .",
    "if truncated , this expansion may fail to demonstrate stability with potentials that do bind , because it lacks explicit @xmath30 components , which are important near threshold @xcite , and are included in the gaussian expansion sketched in @xcite and systematically developed in @xcite .",

    "@xcite for a discussion about the four - quark problem .",
    "all authors agree that such states become bound when the quark over the antiquark mass ratio becomes sufficiently large .",

    "the difference between these two states can only come from the short - range part of the interaction .",
    "the first study of tetraquarks with two heavy quarks within qcd ( spectral ) sum rules ( qcdsr ) was done in @xcite by using diquark - antidiquark current .",
    "this study is revisited and improved in the present paper .",

    "<S> we have studied , using double ratio of qcd ( spectral ) sum rules , the ratio between the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 assuming that they are respectively described by the @xmath2 and @xmath3 molecular currents . </S>",
    "<S> we found ( within our approximation ) that the masses of these two states are almost degenerate . since the pion exchange interaction between these mesons is exactly the same , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that if the observed @xmath1 meson is a @xmath4 molecule , then the @xmath5 molecule should also exist with approximately the same mass . </S>",
    "<S> an extension of the analysis to the @xmath6-quark case leads to the same conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the su(3 ) breakings for the @xmath7 mass ratios . motivated by the recent belle observation of two @xmath8 states , we revise our determination of @xmath9 by combining results from exponential and fesr sum rules </S>",
