    "transport properties of quantum junctions have been studied for over two decades motivated not only by their technological relevance but also the opportunities they provide to explore fundamental physics .",
    "for example quantum dot junctions provide a good platform for verification of fundamental concepts , like fluctuation theorems @xcite .",
    "there have also been a lot of technologically relevant proposals of diodes @xcite , transistors @xcite , heat engines @xcite , which can be realized using quantum junctions made of single molecules or quantum dots .",
    "quantum dot junctions can also serve as promising candidates for realizing quantum computers @xcite .",
    "current flowing through quantum dot junctions have been measured experimentally @xcite and studied using various theoretical formulations like quantum master equations ( qme ) @xcite , scattering matrix ( sm ) @xcite , and non equilibrium green s function ( negf ) method @xcite .",
    "qme and sm approaches are valid within a certain parameter regime , but negf method is exact and can be applied in all regimes , although analytically tractable results can be obtained only for non - interacting systems .",
    "although a good amount of theoretical work on quantum conduction exists in the literature , however the role of system - reservoir coupling has not been much emphasized , except in the discussions of decoherence @xcite . how does the current vary as system - reservoir coupling is changed ? to answer this question we note that , in a simple scattering picture , the system - reservoir coupling offers resistance to the tunneling electrons .",
    "higher the coupling , lower the resistance and , therefore , larger is the current .",
    "this picture is in full agreement with the results of quantum master equation formulation which predicts a monotonic increase in the current as the coupling is increased .",
    "however , this does not present the complete picture and it is not at all obvious what happens as one goes beyond the regime of qme or simple scattering picture .    in this work",
    "we explore the effect of strong system - reservoir couplings on the net current flowing through quantum junctions .",
    "we find that current is not always an increasing function of the coupling strength .",
    "in fact , surprisingly , we find that for certain cases , the net current may diminish at large coupling strengths . as we discuss below",
    ", this surprising behavior is a consequence of the quantum interference between the eigenstates which carries a negative ( against the applied bias ) current which may cancel the current contributions coming from the eigenstates . the current behavior for large couplings ,",
    "of course , depends on the quantum dot configuration and is not universal . for certain configurations ,",
    "there is an optimal value of the coupling strength at which the current is maximal .    to explore this current behavior we consider two simple models both consist of two quantum dots coupled to two fermionic reservoirs but differ in their configurations .",
    "this is discussed in the next section . in sec .",
    "( [ sec-3 ] ) , we calculate the net current flowing through these junctions and partition it into contributions coming from populations and coherences and analyze the behavior of these contributions as a function of system reservoir coupling strengths .",
    "we present conclusions in sec .",
    "( [ sec-4 ] ) .",
    "we start by considering a simple model shown in fig . [ model ] .",
    "it consists of two quantum dots each having a single electron orbital coupled to each other and also coupled to two fermionic reservoirs .",
    "the hamiltonian describing this model is given as , @xmath0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the single particle hamiltonian for the isolated molecule . here",
    "@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) are the fermionic annihilation ( creation ) operators for destroying ( creating ) electron at site @xmath4 and similarly @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are operators for destroying ( creating ) electron in state labeled by k in the @xmath7 lead ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "first two terms in the hamiltonian represent isolated system and lead hamiltonians , and the third term represents hybridization between system and lead sites with @xmath9 and @xmath10 representing coupling of the @xmath7th lead with dot @xmath11 and dot @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "we have also assumed wide - band approximation ( system lead coupling is independent of k ) .",
    "the net current @xmath13 ( same as @xmath14 ) flowing into the left lead at steady - state is given by the rate of change of charge on the left lead i.e. , @xmath15 .",

    "bonding and anti - bonding ( population ) contributions are equal due to the parameters chosen ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 )",

    "( [ fig-4 ] ) . it is to be noted that although current through the population and coherence channels increases linearly with @xmath46 , the zero - bias conductivity is quadratic while the finite - bias conductivity reaches a constant value @xmath99 for the population ( @xmath100 ) and coherence ( @xmath101 ) channels , respectively .",
    "in this work we have explored the effects of system - reservoir coupling on currents through molecular ( quantum dot ) junctions .",
    "it is shown that the net current in a molecular junction is not always a monotonically increasing function of the coupling strength .",
    "we have demonstrated this by considering two simple model junctions which are easily realizable in experiments . for a serially arranged double quantum dot system , the net current behaves non - monotonically and goes to zero for large @xmath46 , while for a side - coupled quantum dot system , the current increases monotonically and saturates to a finite non - zero value .",
    "these two different current behaviors originate due to competition between the classical and the quantum contributions to the junction conductance .",
    "the classical current , described in terms of the eigenstate populations , and the quantum contribution , that comes from the superposition between the eigenstates , have opposite contributions to the net current .",
    "the classical part is always positive ( flows along the applied bias ) while the quantum contribution is always negative for large couplings . for a serially coupled system , for large couplings ( @xmath46 ) , the classical and the quantum contributions saturate to the same finite value that corresponds to the ( quantum ) conductivity of a perfect channel .",
    "the two contributions therefore tend to cancel each other out completely at large @xmath46 , leading to the net zero current through the junction . on the other hand , for a side - coupled system , the two contributions grow linearly with @xmath46 in opposite directions with the same rate .",
    "this results in the net current saturating to a finite value .",
    "the coherent contribution in this case is negative for all @xmath46 values .",
    "it is to be noted that while for serially coupled system , the coherent contribution can be positive or negative or even vanish depending on the system parameters , for a side - coupled system , however , the coherent contribution is always negative and is zero only when the net current vanishes .",
    "that is for a side - coupled system , the coherent channel always conducts in the direction opposite to the applied bias and can not be blocked to maximize the net current , which is possible for a serially coupled system .",
    "although the conclusions drown above are based on calculations on simple model systems , we find that the qualitative results remain valid even for more complicated junctions within more realistic couplings ( without wide - band approximation ) .",
    "for example , for a lorenzian bath spectral density , the results for large couplings @xmath102 remain valid for both model systems .",
    "similarly , for a circular molecular junction , for example benzene molecular junction , the population and coherences contribute oppositely to the net current .",
    "this seems to be a general trend for currents in molecular junctions .",
