    "givental s construction may be used for smooth well formed complete intersections in weighted projective spaces ( as well as it is expected to work for complete intersections in varieties that admit `` good '' toric degenerations like grassmannians , see  @xcite and  @xcite ) in the same way as for complete intersections in smooth toric varieties , see   [ section : nef ] below for details .",

    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in   [ section : nef ] we give definitions of nef partitions and landau  ginzburg models they correspond to . in   [ section : wpgraphs ] we introduce the combinatorial method to deal with nef partitions based on certain graphs with vertices labelled by non - trivial weights of the weighted projective space . in  ",

    "let @xmath3 be a smooth well formed fano complete intersection of hypersurfaces of degrees   in @xmath8 .",
    "assume that @xmath3 admits a nef partition @xmath15    [ definition : givental lg ] givental s landau  ginzburg model is a quasi - projective variety in  @xmath16 with coordinates @xmath17 given by equations @xmath18 together with a function @xmath19 called _",
    "if the nef partition is nice , then one can birationally represent givental s landau  ginzburg model by a complex torus with a function on it . this function",
    "is represented by the following laurent polynomial .",

    "then givental s landau  ginzburg model for @xmath3 is birational to @xmath26 with coordinates @xmath27 with superpotential @xmath28 see  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "indices of variables in the factors in the numerator are  .",
    "however one can choose any @xmath29 indices among @xmath30 to distinguish such variables .",
    "the resulting family is relatively birational to the one presented above .",
    "we see that the main difficulty to represent givental s landau  ginzburg model for a weighted complete intersection by a laurent polynomial is to find a nice nef partition ; once it is found it is easy to get a birational isomorphism between givental s landau  ginzburg model and a complex torus , so any nice nef partition gives a laurent polynomial in this way .",
    "givental s construction of landau  ginzburg models can be applied , besides complete intersections in smooth toric varieties or weighted projective spaces , to other related cases such as complete intersections in grassmannians or partial flag varieties , see  @xcite . unlike the case of weighted projective spaces , it is easy to describe nef partitions in the latter cases , and this can be done in a lot of ways .",
    "however the main problem for representing landau  ginzburg models by laurent polynomials in this case is to find a `` good '' nef partition among all of them , and to construct the birational isomorphism with a complex torus , see  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "givental in  @xcite computed _ @xmath5-series _ of complete intersections in smooth toric varieties , that is a generating series of genus zero one - pointed gromov  witten invariants with descendants .",
    "he proved that this series gives a solution of picard  fuchs equation for the family of fibers of the superpotential .",
    "the @xmath5-series is described in terms of boundary divisors of the toric variety and the hypersurfaces that define the complete intersection . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that givental s recipe for @xmath5-series for complete intersections in singular toric varieties works in the same way provided that the complete intersection does not intersect the singular locus of the toric variety .",
    "the reason is that curves lying on the complete intersection ( that is ones that we count ) do not intersect the singular locus , so we can resolve singularities of the toric variety and apply givental s recipe ; the exceptional divisors do not contribute to the @xmath5-series .",
    "thus one can explicitly write down an @xmath5-series for @xmath3",
    ". one can easily compute the main period for @xmath14 , see , for instance ,  @xcite , and check that it coincides with the @xmath5-series for @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , if the newton polytope of @xmath14 is reflexive ( which holds for complete intersections in usual projective spaces , see  @xcite and  @xcite , but in fact it is not common for weighted complete intersections in weighted projective spaces with non - trivial weights ) , then @xmath14 admits a calabi ",
    "yau compactification ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark  9 ) ) .",
