    "evolutionary game theory has been used extensively to study the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas @xcite .",
    "a social dilemma is typically modeled as a game with two strategies , cooperate ( @xmath0 ) and defect ( @xmath1 ) , whose payoffs for pairwise interactions are defined by a matrix of the form    @xmath2    @xcite . for a focal player using a strategy on the left - hand side of this matrix against an opponent using a strategy on the top of the matrix , the first ( resp .",
    "second ) coordinate of the corresponding entry of this matrix is the payoff to the focal player ( resp .",
    "opponent ) .",
    "that is , a cooperator receives @xmath3 when facing another cooperator and @xmath4 when facing a defector ; a defector receives @xmath5 when facing a cooperator and @xmath6 when facing another defector . since the same argument applies to the opponent ,",
    "the game defined by ( [ generic2by2 ] ) is _",
    "symmetric_. if defection pays more than cooperation when the opponent is a cooperator ( @xmath7 ) , but the payoff for mutual cooperation is greater than the payoff for mutual defection ( @xmath8 ) , then a social dilemma @xcite arises from this game due to the conflict of interest between the individual and the group ( or pair ) .",
    "the nature of this social dilemma depends on the ordering of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "biologically , the most important rankings are given by the prisoner s dilemma ( @xmath9 ) and the snowdrift game ( @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "since matrix ( [ generic2by2 ] ) defines a symmetric game , any two players using the same strategy are indistinguishable for the purpose of calculating payoffs . in nature , however , asymmetry frequently arises in interspecies interactions such as parasitic or symbiotic relationships @xcite .",
    "interactions between subpopulations , such as in dawkins battle of the sexes game @xcite , also give rise to asymmetry that can not be modeled by the symmetric matrix ( [ generic2by2 ] ) .",
    "even intraspecies interactions are essentially always asymmetric : ( i ) phenotypic variations such as size , strength , speed , wealth , or intellectual capabilities ; ( ii ) differences in access to and availability of environmental resources ; or ( iii ) each individual s history of past interactions , all affect the interacting individuals differently and result in asymmetric payoffs .",
    "the winner - loser effect , for example , is a well - studied example of effects of previous encounters on future interactions and has been reported across taxa @xcite , including even mollusks @xcite .",
    "asymmetry may also result from the assignment of social roles @xcite , such as the roles of  parent \" and  offspring \" @xcite : cooperation may be tied to individual energy or strength , for example , which is , in turn , determined by a player s role . in the realm of continuous strategies , adaptive dynamics has been used to study asymmetric competition , which applies to the resource consumption of plants , for instance @xcite . in social dilemmas containing many cooperators , accumulated benefits may be synergistically enhanced ( or discounted ) in a way that depends on who or where the players are @xcite , thereby making larger group interactions asymmetric . to model such interactions using evolutionary game theory",
    ", the payoff matrix must reflect the asymmetry .    in the _ donation game _",
    ", a cooperator pays a cost , @xmath11 , to deliver a benefit , @xmath12 , to the opponent , while a defector pays no cost and provides no benefit @xcite . in terms of matrix ( [ generic2by2 ] )",
    ", this game satisfies @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "provided @xmath12 and @xmath11 are positive , mutual defection is the only nash equilibrium . if @xmath17 , then this game defines a prisoner s dilemma .",
    "perhaps the simplest way to modify this game to account for possible sources of asymmetry is to allow for each pair of players to have a distinct payoff matrix ; that is , the payoff matrix for player @xmath18 against player @xmath19 in the donation game is    @xmath20    for some @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "if player @xmath18 cooperates , then this player donates @xmath21 to his or her opponent and incurs a cost of @xmath23 for doing so . as before ,",
    "defectors provide no benefit and pay no cost .",
    "the index @xmath18 could refer to a baseline trait of the player , the player s location , his or her history of past interactions , motivation @xcite , or any other non - strategy characteristic that distinguishes one player from another .",
    "games based on matrices of the form ( [ donationmatrix ] ) , with payoffs for _ both _ players in each entry of the matrix , are sometimes called _ bimatrix _ games .",
    "although bimatrix games have appeared in the context of evolutionary dynamics @xcite , most of the focus on these games has been in the setting of classical game theory and economics ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where  matrix game \" generally means  bimatrix game . \"",
    "bimatrix games may be used to model classical asymmetric interactions such as those arising from sexual asymmetry in the battle of the sexes game @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric , four - strategy hawk - dove game of @xcite consisting of the strategies hawk , dove , bourgeois , and anti - bourgeois may also be framed as a ( @xmath25 ) bimatrix game ( see * ? ? ?",
    "symmetric matrix games , such as ( [ generic2by2 ] ) , are special cases of bimatrix games .",
    "we explore here the ways in which bimatrix games can be incorporated into evolutionary dynamics and used to model natural asymmetries in biological populations .",
    "we treat two particular forms of asymmetry : _ ecological _ and _ genotypic_. ecological asymmetry is derived from the locations of the players , whereas genotypic asymmetry is based on the players themselves . with ecological asymmetry , @xmath26 is the payoff matrix for a player at _ location _",
    "@xmath18 against a player at _ location _ @xmath19 .",
    "since the payoffs depend on the locations of the players , this form of asymmetry requires a structured population .",
    "ecological asymmetry is a natural consideration in evolutionary dynamics since it ties strategy success to the environment . in the donation game , for instance",
    ", cooperators might be donating goods or services , but the costs and benefits may depend on the environmental conditions , i.e. the location of the donor .    on the other hand",
    ", players might instead differ in ability or strength , and ",
    "strong \" cooperators might contribute greater benefits ( or incur lower costs ) than  weak \" cooperators .",
    "this variation results in genotypic asymmetry , where each player has a baseline genotype ( strength ) and a strategy ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) .",
    "this form of asymmetry turns out to be subtler than it seems at first glance , however , since genotypes are generally represented by strategies in evolutionary game theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , it might seem that the genotype and strategy of a player could be combined into a single composite strategy and that the symmetric game based on these composite strategies could replace the original asymmetric game . as it happens , whether genotypic asymmetry can be resolved by a symmetric game depends on the details of the evolutionary process .",
    "classically , evolutionary games were studied in infinite populations via replicator dynamics @xcite , and more recently these games have been considered in finite populations @xcite . because every biological population is finite , we focus on finite populations ( which , for technical reasons , we assume to be large ) . since ecological asymmetry requires distinguishing different locations within the population , we assume that the population is structured and that a network defines the structure .",
    "network - structured populations have received a considerable amount of attention in evolutionary game theory and provide a natural setting in which to study social dilemmas @xcite .",
    "compared to well - mixed populations , in which each player interacts with every other player , networks can restrict the interactions that occur within the population by specifying which players are `` neighbors , '' i.e. share a link .",
    "we represent the links among the @xmath27 players in the population using an adjacency matrix , @xmath28 , which is defined by letting @xmath29 if there is a link from vertex @xmath18 to vertex @xmath19 and @xmath30 otherwise ( and satisfies @xmath31 for each @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .    in an evolutionary game ,",
    "the _ state _ of a population of players is defined by specifying the strategy of each player .",
    "each player interacts with all of his or her neighbors .",
    "the total payoff to a player is multiplied by a selection intensity , @xmath32 , and then converted into _ fitness _ ( see methods ) .",
    "once each player is assigned a fitness , an update rule is used to determine the state of the population at the next time step @xcite .",
    "for example , with a birth - death update rule , a player is chosen from the population for reproduction with probability proportional to relative fitness .",
    "a neighbor of the reproducing player is then randomly chosen for death , and the offspring , who inherits the strategy of the parent , fills the vacancy .",
    "this process is a modification of the moran process @xcite , adapted to allow for ( i ) frequency - dependent fitnesses and ( ii ) population structures that are not necessarily well - mixed .",
    "the order of birth and death could also be reversed to get a death - birth update rule @xcite . in this rule",
    ", death occurs at random and the neighbors of the deceased compete to reproduce in order to fill the vacancy .",
    "these two rules result in the update of a single strategy in each time step , but one could consider other rules , such as wright - fisher updating , in which _ all _ of the strategies are revised in each generation @xcite .",
    "the rules mentioned to this point define strategy updates via reproduction and inheritance ; as such , we refer to them as _ genetic _ update rules .",
    "another popular class of update rules is based on revisions to the existing players strategy choices .",
    "we refer to rules falling into this class as _ cultural _ update rules .",
    "examples include imitation updating , in which a player is selected at random to evaluate his or her strategy and then probabilistically compares this strategy to those of his or her neighbors @xcite . a more localized version of this update rule is known as pairwise comparison updating , in which a player chooses a random neighbor for comparison rather than looking at the entire neighborhood @xcite . under _ best response dynamics _",
    ", an individual adopts the strategy that performs best given the current strategies of his or her neighbors @xcite . in each of these cultural processes ,",
    "the strategy of a player can change , but the underlying genotype is always the same , which suggests that baseline genotype and strategy need to be treated separately .",
    "genotypic asymmetry needs to be handled more carefully if the update rule is genetic since the nature of genotype transmission affects the dynamics of the process .",
    "in contrast to cultural processes , the genotype _ and _ strategy of a player at a given location may both change if the update rule is genetic : genotype may be inherited but not imitated .",
    "we will see that this property results in cultural and genetic processes behaving completely differently in the presence of genotypic asymmetry .",
    "_ phenotype _ may have both genetic and environmental components @xcite , and after treating the genetic ( genotypic ) and environmental components separately , these two forms of asymmetry may be combined in order to get a model in which the asymmetry is derived from varying baseline phenotypes .",
    "thus , with a theory of both ecological asymmetry and genotypic asymmetry based on inherited genotypes , one can account for more complicated forms of asymmetry appearing in biological populations .",
    "here we develop a framework for _ ecologically _ asymmetric games in which the payoffs depend on the locations of the players as well as their strategies .",
    "we assume that all of the players have the same set of strategies ( or  actions \" ) available to them , @xmath33 .",
    "the payoff matrix for a player at vertex @xmath18 against a player at vertex @xmath19 is    @xmath34    that is , a player at vertex @xmath18 using strategy @xmath35 against an opponent at vertex @xmath19 using strategy @xmath36 realizes a payoff of @xmath37 , whereas his opponent receives @xmath38 . since @xmath37 depends on @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    ", these payoff matrices capture the asymmetry of the game .",
    "in the simpler setting of symmetric games , the pair approximation method has been used successfully to describe the dynamics of evolutionary processes on networks @xcite . for each @xmath39",
    ", this method approximates the frequency of strategy @xmath35 , which we denote by @xmath40 , using the frequencies of strategy pairs in the population .",
    "pair approximation is expected to be accurate on large _ random regular _ networks @xcite , so we assume that the network is regular ( of degree @xmath41 ) and that @xmath27 is sufficiently large .",
    "( for @xmath42 , the network is just a cycle , which we do not treat here . )",
    "we also take @xmath43 , meaning that selection is _ weak _ , which results in a separation of timescales : the local configurations equilibrate quickly , while the global strategy frequencies change much more slowly .",
    "this separation allows us to get an explicit expression for the expected change , @xmath44 $ ] , in the frequency of strategy @xmath35 for each @xmath45 . incidentally , weak selection happens to be quite reasonable from a biological perspective since each trait is expected to have only a small effect on the overall fitness of a player @xcite .",
    "interestingly , for two genetic and two cultural update rules , weak selection reduces ecological asymmetry to a symmetric game derived from the spatial average of the payoff matrices :    [ thm : maintheorem ] in the limit of weak selection , the dynamics of the ecologically asymmetric death - birth , birth - death , imitation , and pairwise comparison processes on a large , regular network may be approximated by the dynamics of a _ symmetric _ game with the same update rule and payoff matrix @xmath46 , i.e.    @xmath47    where @xmath48 for each @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    for a proof of theorem  [ thm : maintheorem ] ,",

    "( for each of the four processes , the explicit expression for @xmath55 is provided in methods . ) the matrix @xmath57 accounts for local competition resulting from the population structure ( see * ? ? ? * ) . in particular ,",
    "the ohtsuki - nowak transform ,    @xmath58    which transforms the classical replicator equation into the replicator equation on graphs , also applies to evolutionary games with ecological asymmetry .",
    "even though interactions are now governed by a symmetric game , theorem  [ thm : maintheorem ] states that , in general , the dynamics depend on the particular network configuration , @xmath28 ; that is , the symmetric payoffs defined by @xmath51 still depend on the network structure , or , equivalently , on the distribution of ecological resources within the population .",
    "however , somewhat surprisingly , there is a broad class of games for which this dependence vanishes :    [ def : spatiallyadditive ] if @xmath59 for each @xmath45 and @xmath49 , then @xmath26 is called a _ spatially additive _ payoff matrix . if @xmath26 is spatially additive for each @xmath18 and @xmath19 , then the game is said to be spatially additive .",
    "a game is spatially additive if the payoff for an interaction between any two members of the population can be decomposed as a sum of two components , one from each player s location .",
    "note that spatial additivity is different from the  equal gains from switching \" property @xcite in that neither implies the other .",
    "however , spatial additivity is an analogue in the following sense : if two players at different locations use the same strategy against a common opponent , then the difference in these two players payoffs for this interaction is independent of the location of the opponent .",
    "interchanging  location \" and  strategy , \" one obtains the equal gains from switching property . the importance of spatially additive games is due to the following corollary to theorem  [ thm : maintheorem ] :    [ cor : spatiallyadditive ] if @xmath26 is spatially additive for each @xmath18 and @xmath19 , then the expected change in the frequency of strategy @xmath35 , @xmath44 $ ] , is independent of @xmath28 for each @xmath45 . in particular , the dynamics of the process do not depend on the particular network configuration .    as an example ,",
    "the asymmetric donation game is spatially additive _ and _ possesses the equal gains from switching property , which greatly simplifies the analysis of its dynamics :    [ ex : donationecological ] the asymmetric donation game with payoff matrices defined by eq .",
    "( [ donationmatrix ] ) is spatially additive and satisfies    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of the asymmetric game are the same as those of its symmetric counterpart with benefit , @xmath63 , and cost , @xmath64 , regardless of network configuration or resource distribution . under death - birth ( resp .",
    "imitation ) updating , this result implies that cooperation is expected to increase if and only if @xmath65 ( resp .",

    "[ fig : ecological](a ) compares the predicted result obtained from @xmath51 to simulation data for imitation updating when benefit and cost values are distributed according to gaussian random variables .    in order to illustrate",
    "when corollary  [ cor : spatiallyadditive ] fails , we turn to cooperation in the snowdrift game @xcite . in this game , two drivers find themselves on either side of a snowdrift . if both cooperate in clearing the snowdrift , they share the cost , @xmath11 , equally , and both receive the benefit of being able to pass , @xmath12 . if one player cooperates and the other defects , both players receive @xmath12 but the cooperator pays the full cost , @xmath11 .",
    "if both players defect , each receives no benefit and pays no cost . in order to incorporate ecological asymmetry",
    ", we assume that the benefits are all the same since they are derived from being able to pass in the absence of a snowdrift . on the other hand ,",
    "the cost a player pays to clear the snowdrift may depend on his or her location : the snowdrift may appear on an incline , for example , in which case one player shovels with the gradient and the other player against it .",
    "moreover , when two cooperators meet , they might clear unequal shares of the snowdrift . thus , the payoff matrix for a player at location @xmath18 against a player at location @xmath19 should be of the form    @xmath67    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "intuitively , when two cooperators face one other , they each begin to clear the snowdrift and stop once they meet ; the quantity @xmath70 indicates the fraction of the snowdrift a cooperator at location @xmath18 clears before meeting the cooperator at location @xmath19 .",
    "a natural choice for @xmath70 is    @xmath71    which is the unique value that gives @xmath72 for each @xmath18 and @xmath19 , ensuring that the game is _ fair _ ,",
    "i.e. that the cooperator with the higher cost clears a smaller portion of the snowdrift than the one with the lower cost .",
    "averaging the payoff to one cooperator against another over all possible locations gives    @xmath73    which is the upper - left entry of @xmath51 .",
    "in contrast , the remaining three entries of @xmath51 do not depend on @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , provided there are at least two locations with distinct cost values , the dynamics of an evolutionary process depend on the particular network configuration ( theorem  [ thm : maintheorem ] ) .",
    "this network dependence is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : networkdependence ] .",
    "suppose now that we set @xmath74 to model ecological asymmetry in the snowdrift game ; that is , if two cooperators meet , they each clear exactly half of the snowdrift .",
    "if there are two cost values in the population , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , with @xmath77 , then a player who incurs a cost of @xmath75 finds it beneficial to cooperate against a defector , but a player who incurs a cost of @xmath76 would rather defect in this situation .",
    "thus , based on the social dilemma implied by the ranking of the payoffs , a player who incurs a cost of @xmath75 for cooperating is always playing a snowdrift game while a player who incurs a cost of @xmath76 is always playing a prisoner s dilemma .",
    "it follows that ecological asymmetry can account for multiple social dilemmas being played within a single population , even if the players all use the same set of strategies ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "the payoff matrices of this particular game are spatially additive , so , by corollary  [ cor : spatiallyadditive ] , the dynamics do not depend on the network configuration .",
    "if @xmath78 is the fraction of vertices with cost value @xmath75 then @xmath79 is the average cost of cooperation for a particular location and the dynamics are the same as those of the symmetric snowdrift game in which the cost of clearing a snowdrift is @xmath64 ( see fig .  [",

    "that is , microscopically , there is a mixture of prisoner s dilemmas and snowdrift games , but , macroscopically , the process behaves like just one of these social dilemmas . consequently , although the dynamics of this evolutionary process may depend on the network configuration , the type of social dilemma implied by this game does not .        , as a function of the frequency of cooperators , @xmath82 , for a spatially non - additive snowdrift game , eq .",

    "in contrast , for genetic update rules , the asymmetry present due to differing genotypes can be removed completely if the genotypes of offspring are determined by genetic inheritance :      genetic update rules are defined by the ability of players to propagate their offspring to other locations in the population by means of births and deaths . in other words , there is a reproductive step in which genetic information is passed from parent(s ) to child .",

    "for example , consider a model player whose offspring _ replaces _ a focal player and a model player whose strategy is _ imitated _ by a focal player .",
    "for symmetric games , processes based on these two types of updates are mathematically identical ; if asymmetry is present , then the fact that one update is genetic ( replacement ) and the other is cultural ( imitation ) becomes important .",
    "thus , asymmetric games can highlight fundamental differences in evolutionary processes that are based on distinct update rules but happen to behave similarly when the underlying game is symmetric .    in order to incorporate into evolutionary games",
    "the asymmetries commonly studied in classical game theory , our focus has been on games with asymmetric _ payoffs_. games with asymmetric payoffs arise naturally from different forms of interaction heterogeneity .",
    "dependence of payoffs on the environment is a reasonable assumption when considering ecological variation @xcite .",
    "certain patches may provide resources or have drawbacks that influence a player s success when using a particular strategy @xcite .",
    "asymmetric interactions may also be the result of heterogeneity in the sizes or strengths of players @xcite .",
    "whether the source of asymmetry is the environment or the players themselves , our model effectively resolves a collection of microscopically asymmetric interactions with a macroscopically symmetric game in the limit of weak selection . figs .",
    "[ fig : ecological ] and [ fig : networkdependence ] illustrate this result for three common update rules .",
    "similar forms of asymmetry have been studied previously in evolutionary game theory : @xcite consider asymmetry appearing in the update rule that results in  attractive \" and  repulsive \" players in the pairwise comparison process .",
    "for games with population structures defined by _ two _ graphs (  interaction \" and  dispersal \" graphs ) , @xcite show that the evolution of cooperation can be inhibited by asymmetry arising from differences in these two graphs .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite show that heterogeneous population structures can promote the evolution of cooperation by effectively transforming a collection of microscopic social dilemmas into a global coordination game .",
    "this result is reminiscent of our theorem  [ thm : maintheorem ] , which relates the microscopic interactions to the global behavior of a process .",
    "such heterogeneous population structures can result in asymmetric interactions even if the underlying game is symmetric @xcite .",
    "these models , although somewhat different from ours , demonstrate that asymmetry ( in its many forms ) has a remarkable effect on evolutionary dynamics .",
    "although genotypic asymmetry can always be reduced to a ( larger ) symmetric game under genetic update rules , this symmetric game can be of independent interest .",
    "for example , eq .  ( [ eq : genotypicbd ] ) shows that if cooperators vary in size or strength , then certain cooperators may increase in the donation game even under birth - death updating .",
    "in contrast , cooperation never increases in the absence of cooperator variation @xcite . though defectors still eventually outcompete cooperators , the transient increase in cooperators suggests that other evolutionary processes with this form of asymmetry can behave in novel ways .",
    "if both ecological and genotypic asymmetries are present , they can be handled separately : genotypic asymmetry is reduced to either ( i ) ecological asymmetry ( if the update rule is cultural ) or ( ii ) a symmetric game with more strategies ( if the update rule is genetic ) . in either case , an evolutionary game with both ecological and genotypic asymmetries can be reduced to a game with ecological asymmetry only and hence theorem  [ thm : maintheorem ] applies .",
    "our framework handles asymmetry resulting from varying baseline traits due to _ both _ environment and genotype , which could be referred to as _",
    "asymmetry .",
    "the presence of ecological or genotypic asymmetry in an evolutionary process does not necessarily depend on the selection strength or update rule ; these forms of asymmetry may be incorporated into many evolutionary processes .",
    "theorem  [ thm : maintheorem ] , which effectively reduces a game with ecological asymmetry to a particular symmetric game , is stated for four common update rules in evolutionary game theory .",
    "[ fig : ecologicalstrongerselection ] demonstrates ( using the asymmetric snowdrift game ) that this theorem is specific to _ weak _ selection .",
    "that selection is weak is often a reasonable assumption when using evolutionary games to study populations of organisms with many traits .",
    "however , our study of the asymmetric snowdrift game for stronger selection strengths suggests that the behavior of asymmetric games is more complicated if selection is strong . though more difficult to treat analytically , symmetric games under strong selection are worthy of further investigation .",
    "asymmetry is omnipresent in nature , and any framework that is used to model evolution should take into account possible sources of asymmetry .",
    "we have formally introduced ecological and genotypic asymmetries into evolutionary game theory and have studied these asymmetries in the limit of weak selection .",
    "asymmetry has a natural place in the donation game and the snowdrift game , but our results are applicable to any general @xmath94-strategy matrix game .",
    "our treatment of asymmetry highlights important differences between models of cultural and genetic evolution that are not apparent in the traditional setting of symmetric games .",
    "ecological and genotypic asymmetries cover a wide variety of background variation observed in biological populations , and , as such , our framework enhances the modeling capacity of evolutionary games .",
    "for the two genetic processes ( death - birth and birth - death ) and the two cultural processes ( imitation and pairwise comparison ) we consider , we treat ecologically asymmetric games on a large , regular network using pair approximation @xcite .",
    "we assume here that the degree of the network , @xmath56 , is at least @xmath133 . for @xmath42 ,",
    "the network is just a cycle , and we do not treat this case here .",
    "the detailed steps of each calculation are omitted but we include the main setups to allow for reconstruction of the reported results .",
    "we begin by recalling the way in which these four processes are defined ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) :    1 .   in the death - birth process",
    ", a player is selected uniformly at random from the population for death .",
    "a neighbor of the focal individual is then selected to reproduce with probability proportional to relative fitness , and the resulting offspring replaces the deceased player ; 2 .   in the birth - death process",
    ", an individual is selected from the population for reproduction with probability proportional to relative fitness , and the offspring replaces a neighbor at random ; 3 .   in the imitation process",
    ", an individual is chosen uniformly at random to evaluate his or her strategy .",
    "this focal individual either adopts a strategy of a neighbor ( with probability proportional to that neighbor s relative fitness ) or retains his or her original strategy ( with probability proportional to own relative fitness ) ; 4 .   in the pairwise comparison process ,",
    "a focal individual is selected uniformly at random from the population to evaluate his or her strategy .",
    "a model individual is then chosen uniformly at random from the neighbors of the focal individual as a basis for comparison , and the focal player adopts the strategy of the model player with probability proportional to the model player s relative fitness .",
    "let @xmath134 be the set of pure strategies available to each player and suppose that there are @xmath27 players on a regular network of size @xmath27 ( i.e. every node is occupied ) .",

    "<S> a common assumption in evolutionary game theory is that interactions are symmetric , which means that the players are distinguished by only their strategies . in nature , however , the microscopic interactions between players are nearly always asymmetric due to environmental effects , differing baseline characteristics , and other possible sources of heterogeneity . to model these phenomena , we introduce into evolutionary game theory two broad classes of asymmetric interactions : ecological and genotypic . </S>",
    "<S> ecological asymmetry results from variation in the environments of the players , while genotypic asymmetry is a consequence of the players having differing baseline genotypes . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a theory of these forms of asymmetry for games in structured populations and use the classical social dilemmas , the prisoner s dilemma and the snowdrift game , for illustrations . </S>",
