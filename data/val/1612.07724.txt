    "the innermost regions in agn are in a strong gravity regime due to their close proximities to the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",

    "x  ray  time - resolved spectroscopy of agn is therefore our ultimate tool to probe gr effects under extreme gravity conditions .",
    "the emission from the approaching side of the disk is enhanced due to doppler boosting , while it is diminished from the receding side . since the central engine is unresolved , obscuration by optically thick matter of the different x  ray  emitting regions by structures in our line of sight ( los ) is a promising manner to distinguish the reflection from different parts of the disk @xcite , and a method to investigate relativistic effects in agn x ",

    "ray  absorption in agn has been noticed on all time scales , not depending of their luminosity or morphology @xcite .",
    "the absorber has been identified with clouds of the dusty , clumpy torus at the pc  scales and long timescales @xcite , or the blr at short timescales @xcite . in the latter , the observed absorption variability points to cloud sizes of the order of few gravitational radii , thus comparable to the x  ray  emitting regions .",
    "so , detailed modeling of such events can enable us to draw an accurate picture of the system s geometry .",
    "this high variability has been explained through fast column density changes as a result of material in the blr crossing our los @xcite .",
    "agn spectra are composed of at least two components : the continuum power law emission , from the corona , and the reflection  dominated component , from the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "both components arise from regions of the accretion flow only a few  @xmath1 away from the central smbh @xcite .",
    "the geometry that we assume for the system consists of a smbh , characterized by its mass ( @xmath2 ) and spin parameter ( @xmath3 ) , around which an optically thick but physically thin ionized accretion disk extends from the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) out to @xmath4 .",

    "ray  source : the hot and radiatively compact spherical corona with radius between @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite ; the slab geometry @xcite ; the patchy structure @xcite ; and the jet base interpretation @xcite , just to mention some of them .",
    "we adhere to the slab geometry : in the following , the corona is a parallel plane at a negligible distance above the disk .",
    "the inner radius of the corona is forced to be coincidental with the isco , while its outer radius is only a few @xmath1 .",
    "for the reprocessed component , we assume it to arise from the innermost regions of the accretion disk , between the isco and an outer limit determined by the disk s emissivity index which is constrained to satisfy that at least @xmath7 of the reprocessed emission comes from the innermost @xmath8@xmath9@xmath1 , i.e.  @xmath10 .",
    "the eclipsing cloud is assumed to be co  rotating with the disk at a velocity of 3000kms@xmath11 , typical of the blr of the system . since these kind of obscuration events are more likely to be detected in unobscured sources , we disregard the torus of the unification models within the framework of this work .",
    "we build our model within @xcite , as a power law accounting for the x  ray  continuum , plus the x  ray  reflection code xillver @xcite accounting for the reflection component .",
    "these two components are multiplied by the kynconv relativistic convolution model @xcite , which adds all relativistic effects due to strong gravity and fast motions close to the smbh , allowing to obscure part of the emission with a circular cloud whose size and position can be determined .",
    "we model the accretion disk to cover at least one half of the sky as seen from the central engine , with a typical ionization of @xmath12ergcms@xmath11 and solar abundances .",
    "the energy cutoff is frozen to 300kev .",
    "the main parameters that can be tuned are : the inclination @xmath13 of the system with respect to our los ; the black hole spin @xmath14 ; the emissivity index @xmath15 ; the cloud position ; and the cloud size .",
    "the column density @xmath16 and ionization log@xmath17 of the cloud are set by the ionized absorption code @xcite .",

    "we choose an intermediate arbitrary intermediate value of @xmath18 .",
    "absorption due to partially ionized material in the host galaxy is modelled with .",
    "the equivalent column density ranges from @xmath19 ( compton  thin ) to @xmath20 ( compton  thick ) , typical for clouds in the blr . its ionization takes values between @xmath21 ( neutral ) and @xmath22 ( highly ionized material ) .",
    "the radius and position of the cloud are determined by a set of parameters of the relativistic code , all in terms of gravitational radii .",
    "the primary continuum emission from the corona is modelled with a simple power law component with photon index set to a typical value of @xmath23 .",
    "the continuum normalization is chosen so that the unabsorbed @xmath24kev  x  ray  flux is @xmath25erg@xmath26s@xmath11 , typical for bright , local agn .",

    "the reprocessed emission is modelled by means of the x ",
    "ray  reflection code @xcite .",
    "the photon index is the same as for the continuum .",
    "the iron abundance is set to solar and the disk ionization is fixed to a typical value of log@xmath28 in order to allow the existence of enough reflection features .",
    "we set the same cutoff as for the power law .",
    "finally , the reflection normalization is fixed in order to get a reflection fraction between 1 and 2 , i.e.  the disk to cover at least one half of the sky as seen from the central engine , in agreement with observations .",

    "therefore the flux - profiles observed are symmetric .",

    "notice that the flux from the approaching side of the disk ( left wing ) is several times greater than that from the receding side ( right wing ) in the gr - dominated scenario .",
    "different values of the isco , and hence the smbh spin , imprint the eclipse lightcurves too . in the cases where the cloud size is comparable to the isco , it is possible to measure the isco with great precision in an unprecedented manner when the size of the cloud is known , by simply measuring the distance between the peak preceding and following the smbh position in the lightcurves",
    "when larger clouds are involved in the eclipse , gr effects are still detectable , although measurement of the isco becomes infeasible .",
    "it is important to mention that the secondary peaks of the lightcurves obtained in some of the configurations described here are beyond the limits of detectability of available instruments .",

    "ray  observatories such as the athena mission must be further investigated . yet , most of the actual physical situations still represent interesting cases that we can discern by using current technology .",
    "the singular shapes of the light curves described in section[model ] can explain the second rise observed in some other light curves detected in actual observations taken during blr clouds eclipses .",
    "variable partial covering in the time  resolved spectral analysis of the seyfert galaxy ngc1365 is well explained by a model consisting of a constant continuum absorbed by a constant column density , plus a variable partial  covering component @xcite .",
    "the covering fraction variations are highly significant and clearly show the signature of a complete transit of an eclipsing cloud .",
    "the same behaviour is shown by swiftj2127.4 + 5654  @xcite .",

    "first we fix some parameters based in previous unabsorbed observations .",

    "we adopt the high  energy cutoff @xmath39kev  @xcite .",
    "we fix the column density of the neutral eclipsing cloud to @xmath40@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "finally , we assume that the cloud follows a keplerian orbit co  rotating with the smbh and the accretion disk , moving at velocity @xmath41kms@xmath11  @xcite . for a black hole mass of @xmath42@xmath43 ,",
    "this is @xmath44@xmath1ks@xmath11 .",
    "the occultation event characterised in swiftj2127.4 + 5654  lasts @xmath45ks , so that considering the upper limit in the velocity as the correct value , the cloud would travel a distance of @xmath9@xmath1 within this lapse @xcite .",
    "we divide the spectra in 24 equal sub ",
    "spectra , consequently each one of these sub  spectra covers @xmath46@xmath1 in the cloud s orbit .",
    "we force the position @xmath47@xmath1 to coincide with the lowest flux observations , so that our observation starts when the cloud is at @xmath48@xmath1 and ends when it reaches @xmath49@xmath1 .",
    "the only parameters that are not frozen are the normalizations of the power law and the reflection component , and the radii of the obscuring cloud and the corona .",
    "these four parameters are free to vary .",
    "the normalization of the reflection component , as well as the cloud and source radii are constrained to be the same for all of the 24 spectra .",
    "the normalizations of the power law are allowed to vary independently for every spectrum .",
    "we performed fits with all the 24 spectra extracted from the  observation of swiftj2127.4 + 5654 .",
    "the results of the fit are poorly constrained ( @xmath50/dof@xmath8@xmath51 , see left column of table[tab : swift_fit ] ) .",

    "the cloud s radius is @xmath73@xmath1 , i.e.  the cloud represents around @xmath8@xmath74 of the source in size ( @xmath8@xmath75 in projected surface ) .",
    "the cloud is only a few times ( less than one order of magnitude ) thicker than when @xmath54 was fixed , with column density of @xmath76@xmath26 , in stead of the originally fixed value of @xmath77@xmath26 .",
    "these results on the geometry of the system are complementary to those obtained when the gr eclipsing cloud code was not used ( see @xcite ) , with cloud and source sizes @xmath78@xmath79@xmath80@xmath1 , and @xmath81@xmath79@xmath82@xmath1 , respectively : both the cloud and the source are slightly larger , most likely in order to account for the larger column density ( @xmath8@xmath83@xmath26 in stead of @xmath8@xmath84@xmath26 ) .",
    "we have introduced a new relativistic x  ray  spectral model for characterising x ",
    "ray  occultation events , involving key parameters such as the size of the x  ray  emitting regions ( the innermost accretion disk and/or the corona ) , the disk s emissivity index , the column density , ionization state , linear size and velocity of the obscuring cloud , the black hole spin , and the inclination of the system with respect to our los . tests on  simulated data show that our instruments detect anisotropic emission from the disk : gr effects enhance the emission from the side of the disk approaching towards the observer , while emission from the receding parts decreases .",
    "we show how an eclipse of the x  ray  emitting regions by a cloud in the blr of the system can be used to probe the close environments of the central smbh .",
    "since the tests carried out have been satisfactory , we fit our relativistic model to real data from a long  observation of swiftj2127.4 + 5654 .",
    "we define an annulus - like x  ray  source , parallel and close to the accretion disk , whose inner radius is fixed to @xmath71@xmath1 from previous unabsorbed observations .",

    "the sizes of the cloud and the source are lightly larger , probably in order to balance the larger column density calculated in the gr scenario .",
