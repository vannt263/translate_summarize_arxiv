    "currently , a large number of lattice results have appeared using staggered fermions to discretize the quark fields.@xcite what contrasts these calculations with earlier lattice calculations is the use of 2 + 1 dynamical flavors of light quarks , with up and down quark masses down to @xmath0 ( where the lattice strange quark mass is roughly its correct value ) , multiple lattice spacings , and the ability to understand the light quark and continuum limit .",
    "this last step allows one to minimize systematic errors in many of these results , so as to make an accurate extrapolation to the physical values of the light quark masses .    for staggered fermions ,",
    "this step is highly non - trivial .",
    "introductions of scaling violations which are rather large at finite lattice spacings cause strong effects .",
    "these violations are reduced using improved actions , but are still not negligible.@xcite because many of these violations add to the squared pion mass , it is perhaps not surprising that when attempting to construct the relevant chiral perturbation theory , they must be included as chiral symmetry breaking terms , similar to the way the quark masses enter .",
    "this review is intended to be focussed on this aspect of analyzing lattice data .",
    "we begin by outlining lattice qcd with staggered quarks in sec .",
    "[ sec : latqcd ] .",
    "we continue by discussing the general procedures for deriving a low - energy effective theory for qcd with staggered quarks in sec .",
    "[ sec : schpt ] .",
    "we then use this to calculate some pion - related quantities in sec .",
    "[ sec : pions ] , and include heavy quarks in sec .",
    "[ sec : heavylights ] .",
    "overall , we will focus primarily on results from chiral perturbation theory that have been applied to lattice data to obtain relatively small systematic errors as a result .",
    "there are many other quantities that have been studied , and we will briefly touch upon them in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "we begin by formulating quantum chromodynamics on a discrete spacetime lattice with a uniform lattice spacing @xmath1 .",
    "the quark fields live on sites , and the gluon fields live on links , although we will not discuss the gluons in detail .",
    "while focussing on the quarks , we will discuss everything in terms of the free theory for simplicity , but the results carry over to the interacting case .    the simplest discretization is given by replacing the derivatives in the free euclidean quark action by difference operators : @xmath2\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath3 runs over the three lightest quarks @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a spacetime point , @xmath7 is a unit vector in the @xmath8-direction , and @xmath9 is the mass of the quark flavor @xmath3 .",
    "this action has the well - known doubling problem , which can be seen in the momentum - space propagator for a given flavor @xmath3 @xmath10 this has a low - energy mode as @xmath11 at @xmath12 , but also when any component of @xmath13 is near @xmath14 or 0at one of the corners of the brillouin zone .",
    "the appearance of these additional 15 doublers is a general result of discretizing fermions.@xcite there several techniques to rid oneself of the doubling problem,@xcite and we will focus here on the staggered discretization.@xcite    to arrive at the staggered quark formalism , we realize that when going to a discretized euclidean space , one breaks the @xmath15 rotational symmetry down to a discrete subgroup composed of finite rotations by @xmath16 ( denoted by @xmath17 ) .",
    "this implies that we can perform a redefinition of the quark fields in eq .   that diagonalizes the @xmath18 matrices , thereby decoupling the different spinor components of @xmath19 .",
    "we then keep only one spinor component per field and we have decreased the number of degrees of freedom by a factor of four , and giving us the action @xmath20\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the single - component field remaining after the field redefinition and dropping the other spinor components . to show that this set of 16 single - component fermions ( per flavor @xmath3 ) corresponds to four four - component dirac fermions is a straightforward exercise that we will not pursue here .",
    "the most important point here is that different species ( or `` tastes '' ) of a given flavor are identified ( in momentum space ) with different corners of the brillouin zone.@xcite    it is possible to take only a single flavor and add a more general mass matrix which can split the degeneracy in eq .",
    "so as to describe four - flavor qcd ( the four tastes are identified as four different flavors).@xcite however , this procedure has technical difficulties making it rather tough to implement numerical .",
    "what is done in practice is to create one staggered field for each flavor one wishes to simulate . after evaluating the path integral over the fermions",
    ", we obtain the fermion determinant for each staggered field , which is a determinant describing four tastes .",
    "since these four tastes are degenerate in mass , the fourth - root of this determinant should then be a determinant describing a single taste of the staggered quark.@xcite    this `` rooting '' technique is rather common in staggered simulations , but it is not without theoretical issues . at finite lattice spacing , there are interactions among staggered quarks which violate the taste symmetry : the symmetry which rotates the tastes among themselves and is a symmetry of the free theory . in the interacting theory , the exchange of high momentum gluons can change the taste of a quark .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourquark ] and one can see that by exchanging a momentum of order of the cutoff ( @xmath23 in the figure ) does not move the quark far off shell , as it would with other discretizations , but instead changes the quark to a different taste with a small amount of momentum .",
    "here is assumed to be of order @xmath14 . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are up quarks of different tastes , as are @xmath26 and @xmath27.,width=384 ]    the question remains as to whether or not it is valid to take the fourth root of the staggered determinant _ before _ one takes the continuum limit . if these two operations did not commute , then a rooted - staggered theory would not be equivalent to a one - flavor continuum theory in the continuum limit .",
    "although there is no proof that exists that proves the validity of this procedure , there are indications that the rooted theory is legitimate .",
    "there is a large body of supporting evidence in favor of the validity of the rooted theory , as well as some evidence implying this trick is not valid@xcite ( we refer the reader to ref .   for an excellent review of the current status of the rooting procedure ) . assuming the validity of this trick",
    ", we will now pursue the application of 0.4expt  to the rooted staggered theory .",
    "although the rooting procedure gives the correct number of degrees of freedom in the sea sector , this does not mean that we can not see the effects of these additional tastes .",
    "in fact , we will see that staggered chiral perturbation theory , even after correcting for the fourth - root trick , shows a significant dependence on the different tastes of quarks that arise .",
    "since one can not simulate at physical @xmath24 and @xmath26 quark masses currently , one must extrapolate to the physical masses from the larger masses actually used . for this one",
    "needs chiral perturbation theory ( 0.4expt ) .",
    "however , continuum 0.4expt  is not appropriate for a lattice theory , as there are other sources of chiral symmetry breaking besides the mass term . for staggered quarks ,",
    "this additional chiral symmetry breaking arises primarily from the taste - violating interactions discussed in the previous section . as such",
    ", one must appropriately modify the chiral theory to take into account these additional chiral symmetry breaking effects,@xcite and construct a staggered chiral perturbation theory ( s0.4expt ) .",
    "the first step in this procedure is to write down the symanzik effective action@xcite for the lattice theory .",
    "the idea is that , given a lattice action @xmath28 , one can write it as an expansion in @xmath1 about the continuum limit @xmath29\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the continuum qcd lagrangian . for the staggered quark and gluon actions",
    ", this expansion is in @xmath31 ( there are no errors linear in @xmath1 ) , so only even values of @xmath32 are included in this sum .",
    "we will work only to @xmath33 in this review .",
    "the first term , @xmath30 , is straightforward , as it is merely the continuum lagrangian corresponding to the lattice theory . for higher - order terms , all possible operators that satisfy the lattice symmetries",
    "must be included , making this procedure progressively more difficult when working beyond @xmath34 .",
    "we will discuss the @xmath30 and some of the @xmath34 terms in detail , although the @xmath35 terms have been worked out as well.@xcite in current lattice simulations with staggered quarks , we have @xmath36 with @xmath37 the chiral scale . since in the continuum chiral expansion , @xmath38",
    ", we use a power counting scheme such that @xmath39 as well .",
    "this implies that we will omit terms in @xmath34 that have powers of the quark masses or derivatives , as these terms would necessarily be of order @xmath40 ( we use @xmath13 generically for any power of derivative or pion mass for simplicity ) , which is one higher order than that which we are working to .",
    "once we have the symanzik action worked out to a given order , we can then transcribe the symanzik terms to the underlying chiral theory .",
    "this process is well understood for the continuum theory@xcite and we will work through the basic details when discussing @xmath30 , as going through this process for the higher - order terms is a straightforward extension .",
    "although the @xmath30 term is simply the continuum lagrangian , recall that this action is one with four tastes for every flavor of quark .",
    "for qcd with @xmath41 flavors , we have @xmath42 where the @xmath43 refers to terms which do not include the quark fields , such as the pure gluon lagrangian .",
    "the quark fields are @xmath44-component objects with the 4 tastes for each of the @xmath41 flavors , and @xmath45 is the @xmath46 mass matrix ( note that the four tastes for each flavor have the same mass ) .",
    "also , the mass matrix is real , but the forthcoming spurion analysis is simpler by considering it to be a complex operator ; in the end we set @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath30 has an @xmath48 chiral symmetry in the limit @xmath49 , where , ( with @xmath50 ) @xmath51 is a symmetry of eq .  .",
    "the chiral symmetry is broken down to the vector subgroup @xmath52 by a non - vanishing quark condensate , which gives rise to @xmath53 goldstone bosons .",
    "these bosons are encapsulated in a field @xmath54 $ ] , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the @xmath46 matrix which contains the goldstone bosons . for the case",
    "where @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 where @xmath59 , _ etc .",
    "_ , and @xmath60 .",
    "we use the euclidean gamma matrices @xmath61 , with @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the @xmath65 identity matrix .",
    "we write eq .   in the flavor basis , where @xmath66 _ etc .",
    "_    since the quark masses are non - zero but small compared with @xmath67 , we can include them as a soft breaking of the chiral symmetry . to do this systematically ,",
    "we promote the mass matrix to a spurion field with the transformation @xmath68 which makes @xmath30 invariant under the chiral symmetry group . thus",
    ", using @xmath69 and @xmath70 , we can write down a low - energy effective action for @xmath30 ( after setting @xmath47 ) : @xmath71 this is just a continuum 0.4expt  expression for @xmath44 flavors of quarks in euclidean space . @xmath3 and @xmath8 are unknown parameters that are directly related to the tree - level pion decay constant and chiral condensate .    the methodology of determining the low - energy chiral lagrangian from the symanzik action is the same for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and so forth . we need to know the operators that exist at the level of the symanzik action , which can , in general , break the chiral symmetry of the massless qcd lagrangian . by promoting objects that appear in the symanzik action to spurion fields with specific transformation properties ( as we did for the mass matrix )",
    ", we can make the theory invariant and then from this , we can generate the corresponding operators at the chiral level .",
    "terms in the symanzik action contributing to @xmath34 come from several sources .",
    "they can only arise from two - quark operators or four - quark operators , but we can immediately drop the two - quark operators from our analysis here .",
    "this is because a two - quark operator has dimension three , which goes to dimension one when we add in the required factor of @xmath31 .",
    "this means we need three powers of mass , in the form of the quark mass or derivatives , and then the overall term will be at least of order @xmath72 , which is higher order than that to which we are working .",
    "the four - quark operators are the only terms we need currently ( one can easily see that higher numbers of quark fields will only contribute at higher powers of @xmath31 ) .",
    "effectively , we are looking at the terms in @xmath34 in the limit @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    in determining the operators that arise in @xmath34 , one must first enumerate all of the operators that are consistent with the full lattice symmetry group at finite @xmath1 .",
    "the full symmetry group was discussed for @xmath75 in ref .   and for general @xmath41 in ref .  .",
    "for non - zero quark mass ( assuming @xmath32 of the quarks are degenerate and @xmath76 are non - degenerate , with @xmath77 ) , this symmetry group is @xmath78 .",
    "here , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are flavor number symmetries , @xmath81 is the clifford group with generators @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the group of hypercubic rotations in euclidean space .",
    "the number of operators that contribute to @xmath34 is around 25 , where spin and taste indices are uncoupled ( there are 10 operators where the spin and taste indices are coupled , but these do not contribute at this order ) .",
    "many of these , however , do not need to be analyzed , as it was shown in ref .   that only `` odd - odd '' four - quark operators need to be included in our list .",
    "with this realization , we can take the analysis for the @xmath75 case from ref .   and make the replacement of the taste matrices @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the @xmath86 identity matrix in flavor space , and @xmath87 can be any of the 16 tastes .",
    "although we will not go into detail on the analysis for all of the operators , we will sketch the steps for a single set of operators . for simplicity",
    "we will pick a four - quark operator that has a vector spin structure and arbitrary taste structure : @xmath88 ^ 2\\ , \\ ] ] where the @xmath89 s and @xmath90 s are the same @xmath44-component objects above , and the taste matrices are going to be set equal in the end , @xmath91 .",

    "a chiral invariant , just as we did for the mass term in @xmath30 .",

    "they will appear as analytic terms when we calculate quantities to one - loop order , however .",
    "we can now use eq .   to calculate light meson ( referred to from now on generically as `` pions '' ) quantities .",

    "@xmath119 , to the physical basis : @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",

    "the procedure for diagonalizing the mass matrix , or equivalently calculating the full propagator , for the flavor - neutral fields is described quite well in ref .  , and we just state the results here . for comparison , we first write the propagators for the flavor - charged fields with taste @xmath87 , or flavor - neutrals with taste @xmath126 or @xmath127 : @xmath128 for the flavor - neutrals , the propagator can be a little more complicated . for the taste - vector , taste - axial , or taste - singlet we have @xmath129 with for the axial and vector tastes : @xmath130 we have written eq .   explicitly for @xmath57 , but one can see the pattern .",
    "there are @xmath41 factors of @xmath131 in both the numerator and denominator .",
    "those in the numerator correspond to masses of the pions in the flavor basis and those in the denominator are those in the physical basis .",
    "the result is the same for the taste singlets , but we can take @xmath122 in those terms to get @xmath132    one final issue we have avoided thus far is the fact that we have an incorrect number of tastes per flavor in our theory .",
    "our theory has @xmath44 species of quarks , or four tastes for the @xmath41 flavors .",

    "these are the loops which are removed by taking the fourth root in lattice simulations , and we must correct for this in the chiral theory . since each quark loop can have four tastes , we merely multiply these terms by a factor of @xmath133 to reduce the theory to the correct number of tastes per flavor .",
    "the multiplication factor arises in two places .",
    "terms which are connected ( only include the @xmath134 parts of the propagators ) and those which are disconnected , coming from the @xmath135 portion of the flavor - neutral propagators . for the latter case ,",
    "the correction is rather straightforward . as explained in detail in ref .",

    "the former case , which corresponds to the connected terms , is also rather straightforward .",
    "identifying the quark loops leads to the conclusion that they must each be multiplied by a factor of @xmath133 .",
