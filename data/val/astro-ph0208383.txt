    "most of the known cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) were originally discovered because of their dramatic optical variability , exemplified by the outbursts of dwarf novae and classical novae .",
    "more recently , however , ultraviolet and x - ray sky surveys have led to discoveries of many new cvs , including members of subclasses that have less spectacular optical light variations ( e.g. , the novalike variables ) .    follow - up investigations at radio wavelengths have led to detections of a few well - known , mostly nearby , cvs as radio sources . in this paper",
    "we report what we believe to be the first case in which the sequence of discovery has been reversed : we have detected a new cv during a radio survey , with the subsequent confirmation having been made in the optical band .",
    "the first ( `` faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters '' ) survey is aimed at producing a deep radio map of 10,000 square degrees at the north and south galactic caps ( see becker , white , & helfand 1995 ; white , becker , helfand , & gregg 1997 ) .",
    "the survey is being carried out at 1.4  ghz with the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) , and can be thought of as a radio analog of the optical palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) .",
    "source positions are provided to better than @xmath1 accuracy , and the sensitivity limit is about 1  mjy .    the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ; gregg et al .",
    "1996 , white et al .",
    "2000 ; becker et al .",
    "2001 ) is a follow - up effort aimed at finding large numbers of qsos and characterizing their properties .",
    "the fbqs candidates are first radio sources that have a stellar - appearing optical counterpart in the apm catalog , which is based on automatic plate measuring machine scans of the poss - i plates ( mcmahon & irwin 1992 ; mcmahon et al .",
    "the majority of fbqs candidates are found to be qsos , bl lac objects , or other extragalactic sources .",
    "only 8% of the candidates turn out to be galactic stars , the bulk of which are merely chance coincidences of unrelated , ordinary foreground stars with the radio positions .",
    "actual radio emission from galactic stars is exceedingly rare , even at the 1  mjy limit of the first survey , as discussed in detail by helfand et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "it was thus a surprise when one of the faint fbqs candidates proved to be a galactic star with an unusual spectrum , which clearly showed it to be a previously unknown cv .",
    "this source , cataloged with a 1.4  ghz radio flux density of 3.58  mjy , lies at the j2000 coordinates given in the first line of table  1 .",
    "lying @xmath2 away from the radio source , at the coordinates listed in the second line of table  1 , is a faint stellar object contained in the apm catalog .",
    "also listed in the bottom line of table  1 are the coordinates and magnitudes of a nearby comparison star , used in the ccd observations described in the next section .",
    "figure  1 presents a finding chart for the optical candidate , with the radio contours superposed .",
    "the radio source is designated first j102347.6 + 003841 ( but hereafter the name will be shortened to first j1023 + 0038 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the discovery spectrogram , which was obtained on 2000 may 6 by mark lacy with the lick observatory 3-m telescope .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by a blue continuum , with superposed emission lines of the balmer series , , and .",
    "the spectrum is fairly typical of a cv in quiescence ( see , for example , the spectroscopic atlas of williams 1983 ) .",
    "however , the lines of and especially of are rather stronger than in most dwarf novae , and suggest that the object may be more closely related to the subset of magnetic or am herculis - type cvs .",
    "the spectrum is , in fact , rather similar to that of am her itself , as illustrated in williams figure  13 .    as this paper was being prepared for publication , we realized that the source lies within the area of the sky covered by the june 2001 early data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; stoughton et al .",
    "inspection of the data archive ( maintained at stsci ) shows that both photometry and a spectrum are available .",
    "table  2 gives the sdss astrometry and photometry for both the cv candidate and the comparison star .",
    "the sdss position is @xmath3 away from the radio position .",
    "the sdss spectrum is quite similar to our lick spectrum shown in figure  2 , although the equivalent widths of the emission lines appear to be slightly lower .",
    "moreover , the emission lines are incipiently resolved into double - peaked profiles .",
    "this would suggest that there is an accretion disk present in the system , and that therefore it may be a dq  herculis - type magnetic cv , rather than a full - fledged am  herculis system ( in which an accretion disk would be lacking ) .",
    "if the optical candidate counterpart of first j1023 + 0038 is a cv , then it would be expected to exhibit rapid optical variability . in order to search for such variations , h.e.b . and m.s.o .",
    "obtained photometric observations on five nights in 2000",
    "november and december , using the 2.1-m reflector at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) .",
    "a tektronix @xmath4 ccd was used , with @xmath5 on - chip binning . in order to maximize the signal",
    ", we used a schott bg39 glass filter , which yields a broad - band blue bandpass .",
    "only a @xmath6 pixel subraster was read out , in order to reduce the read - out time between exposures but still produce a large enough field to contain both the target and a nearby comparison star . even with this ccd setup , however , the readout time was still 25  s with the kpno data acquisition system .",
    "exposure times of 30 - 60  s were used in 2000 november , and were shortened to 10  s for all of the 2000 december observations .",
    "table  3 contains a log of the ccd observations . as noted in the table ,",
    "none of the nights were photometric , but accurate differential photometry is readily possible under non - photometric conditions , as has been shown by grauer & bond ( 1981 ) , ciardullo & bond ( 1996 ) , and many others .",
    "we performed standard aperture photometry on the frames , and reduced the data to differential magnitudes of the target with respect to the comparison star . in order to set an approximate photometric zero point",
    ", we adopted the blue magnitude of 16.14 given for the comparison star in the apm catalog .",
    "figure  3 shows our resulting light curves from the five nights of photometry .",
    "the differential magnitudes are generally accurate to better than 0.01  mag ( i.e. , smaller than the size of the plotting points ) , except on the very cloudy night of 2000 dec 24 where the errors were typically several hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "the object indeed shows variability on both slow and rapid timescales , confirming its classification as a cv .",
    "although generally maintaining a level around magnitude 17.5 , it showed a flare of @xmath00.8  mag lasting about 20  min ( apart from one rapid dip back to the baseline level ) on 2000 december 23 . on december 24",
    "the target was more active , being initially about 0.5  mag brighter than on previous nights , declining briefly , and then ramping up by about 1  mag over about half an hour and remaining at that level for over an hour ( apart from two rapid dips ) .",
    "the object also shows short - timescale flickering , which gives the light curves a noisy appearance . on the first four nights , and on the fifth night when the star was near its baseline level ,",
    "the light curves show a curious `` bimodal '' appearance , i.e. , the magnitudes tend to cluster near either `` high '' or `` low '' levels but rarely in between .",
    "we suspect that this appearance arises from our sparse sampling of a light curve that may have flickering with a timescale of approximately 10  s ; we are thus missing about 2/3 of the points that we would have obtained with uninterrupted 10-s integrations .",
    "power spectra were calculated for all of the light curves , but revealed no significant coherent signals ; of course , we were not able to test for signals with periods shorter than @xmath070  s , such as are seen in some of the dq  her - type subset of magnetic cvs ( patterson 1994 ) , because of the @xmath735  s interval between integrations .",
    "we see no evidence , in our fairly limited data set , for eclipses or other repetitive phenomena occurring on an orbital timescale .",
    "determination of the orbital period of the system will require additional photometry or a radial - velocity study .",
    "a strong confirmation that the optical cv is indeed the counterpart of the radio source would come from variability of the radio source .",
    "we therefore searched the first database for evidence of such variability .",
    "the first survey is based on data collected by the vla on a hexagonal grid of field centers spaced by about @xmath8 , and an object can thus appear in overlapping images from several adjacent fields ( becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) .",
    "the first source catalog is constructed by summing the overlapping fields to get uniform sensitivity on the sky , and does not contain information on source variability . however , a sufficiently bright radio source can be detected by inspecting the individual grid images before they are coadded .",
    "the sensitivity in each observation is a function of the distance of the source from the field center .",
    "table  4 lists details of the three vla observations of fields that contained first j1023 + 0038 .",
    "the successive columns give the observation date and time , followed by the position of the field center .",
    "5 gives the distance of the source from the field center , and col .",
    "6 contains the primary beam response of the vla at that radius .",
    "( note , for example , that the response drops to 0.5 of its value at the field center at a radius of @xmath9 . ) finally , in cols .  7 and 8 , @xmath10 is the measured flux density ( mjy ) for the source ( or the @xmath11 upper limit in the case of non - detection ) , and @xmath12 is the true flux density after correction for the primary beam response .",
    "as table  4 shows , first j1023 + 0038 was detected in only one of the three observations , on 1998 august 10 . at that time , the implied true flux density of 6.6  mjy was well above the @xmath11 upper limits of the two earlier observations .",
    "the source is therefore definitely variable at 1.4  ghz by a factor of 3 or more over a period of only a few days .",
    "the source was also not detected in the 1.4  ghz nrao vla sky survey , carried out between 1993 and 1996 , with a 50% completeness limit of 2.5  mjy ( condon et al .",
    "variability at this level among first radio sources is extremely rare , and makes it virtually certain that the variable radio source is the counterpart of the optical cv .",
    "the first cv to be detected at radio wavelengths was the prototypical magnetic cv am herculis , whose emission was discovered at the vla by chanmugam & dulk ( 1982 ) .",
    "they detected a flux density of 0.67  mjy at 4.9  ghz , and suggested that the emission is from mildly relativistic electrons trapped in the magnetosphere of the white dwarf .",
    "subsequent observations by dulk , bastian , & chanmugam ( 1983 ) led to detection of a strong flare from am  her , which lasted about 10  min and reached a peak of 9.7  mjy at 4.9  ghz ; dulk et al .",
    "were also able to set an upper limit on the quiescent flux density of am  her at 1.4  ghz of 0.24  mjy .",
    "the magnetic dq her - type system ae aqr has also been detected as a variable radio source , with the initial discovery having been made at the vla by bookbinder & lamb ( 1987 ) ; they found a flux density at 1.4  ghz varying from 3 to 5 mjy .",
    "other radio detections of am her- and dq her - type cvs have been reported by pavelin , spencer , & davis ( 1994 ) and references therein .",
    "by contrast , non - magnetic cvs in general are not detectable radio sources ( nelson & spencer 1988 ) , strongly suggesting that a highly magnetic white dwarf is a key element in the production of radio emission . for further information",
    ", the reader is directed to the summary of radio emission from cvs by mason , fisher , & chanmugam ( 1996 ) .",
    "we thus strongly suspect that first j1023 + 0038 is a new magnetic cv , either of the dq  her or am  her variety .",
    "our detection of a 6.6  mjy flare at 1.4  ghz is remarkable because , with a quiescent optical magnitude near 17.5 , first j1023 + 0038 is so optically inconspicuous .",
    "( by comparison , ae  aqr is an 11th - mag object , and am her lies generally around 12th-13th mag , although with occasional drops to `` low '' states below 15th  mag ) .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the flare that led to our serendipitous discovery of first j1023 + 0038 was simply a very rare and unusually energetic one , or whether this object is indeed much more radio luminous than the typical magnetic cvs .",
    "we urge follow - up observations at radio , optical , and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "optical spectroscopy should reveal the orbital period , and might provide direct evidence for a strong magnetic field .",
    "polarimetry would determine whether the object is a highly magnetic am  her system .",
    "a search of archival plate collections , and future long - term photometric monitoring , might reveal either dwarf - nova outbursts , or am  her - like low states , although the object is rather faint .",
