    "since about 1985 it has been recognized that the composition of the solar corona and the photosphere are not the same . in the corona ,",
    "the ratios of abundances of elements with first ionization potentials ( fip ) less than about 10 ev relative to abundances of elements with a fip greater than about 10 ev are about a factor of 3 - 4 times higher than in the photosphere .",
    "those elements with a fip greater than 10 ev appear to have a photospheric composition in general ( with respect to hydrogen ) in the corona , and the low fip elements are enhanced in abundance there .",
    "this fractionation has recently been explained @xcite as being due to the ponderomotive force in the chromosphere from alfvn waves .",
    "this is usually directed upwards , and acts on chromospheric ions , but not neutrals .",
    "elements that are predominantly ionized in the chromosphere ( low fip elements like al , mg , si , ca , and fe ) can be enhanced in abundance as they flow up to the corona , whereas high fip elements such as c , n , o , ne , and ar that are largely neutral appear essentially unaffected . the abundance of sulfur ( fip = 10.36 ev ) is between photospheric and coronal .",
    "it was recognized very early that the most plausible site for fip fractionation was the chromosphere , where low fip elements are generally ionized and where high fip elements are at least partially neutral .",
    "henoux ( 1995 , 1998 ) reviewed the early models .",
    "those which rely on ion - neutral separation by diffusion in magnetic fields , in temperature gradients , or in upward plasma flows suffer from problems of the speed of the process ( diffusion is inherently slow ) or the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "realistic fip effect models must include some form of external force that acts upon the plasma ions but not upon the neutrals .",
    "the first effort along these lines ( antiochos 1994 ) considered the cross - b thermoelectric electric field associated with the downward heat flux carried by electrons which gives rise to chromospheric evaporation .",
    "this draws ions into the flux tube , enhancing their abundance over neutrals .",
    "the absence of a fip effect in coronal holes arises naturally , but in coronal regions where fip fractionation occurs , a mass dependence is predicted , which is not observed .",
    "henoux & somov ( 1992 ) proposed that cross - b pressure gradients arising in current carrying loops could enhance the ion abundance by a `` pinch '' force .",
    "azimuthal motions of the partially ionized photosphere at flux tube boundaries generate a system of currents flowing in opposite directions , such that the azimuthal component of the field vanishes at infinity .",
    "details of the fractionation ( mass dependence , degree , etc ) remain to be worked out , but it is thought to begin just above the temperature minimum region at about 4000 k , and continue until temperatures where all elements are ionized . more recent suggestions have been that chromospheric ions , but not neutrals , are heated by either reconnection events ( arge & mullan 1998 ) , or by waves that can penetrate down to loop footpoints from the corona ( schwadron , fisk & zurbuchen 1999 ) . strengths and weaknesses of these two models are discussed in some detail by laming ( 2004 ) . for the time being we comment that although both models seem capable of producing mass independent fractionation of about the right degree , they , in common with the others mentioned above , only predict positive fip effects . in these models",
    "there is no possibility of an `` inverse fip '' effect such as seen in the coronae of active stars ( see e.g. feldman & laming 2000 , laming 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "this consideration led laming ( 2004 ) to consider the action of ponderomotive forces due to alfvn waves propagating up through the chromosphere and either transmitting into or being reflected from coronal loops .",
    "this force can in principle be either upward or downward and is given approximately by ( see derivation in appendix a ) @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the particle cyclotron frequency and the wave frequency respectively , @xmath3 and @xmath4 the charge and mass , and @xmath5 is the wave peak transverse electric field .",
    "the dependence on the alfvn speed , @xmath6 , means that the ponderomotive force is usually strongest at the top of the chromosphere .",
    "the ponderomotive acceleration , @xmath7 , is independent of the ion mass , leading to the essentially mass independent fractionation that is observed . using an analytic model solar loop from hollweg ( 1984 ) , upward ponderomotive forces on ions are much more common in solar conditions , and for typical density gradients in the chromosphere can be larger than the gravitational force downward .",
    "the magnitude of the fip fractionation is dictated by the resonant properties of the coronal loop and the corresponding wave energy density .",
    "large loops with resonant frequencies similar to the chromospheric period of 200 - 300 seconds admit strong alfvn wave fluxes with correspondingly large fip fractionation .",
    "open field lines , or coronal holes , with formally infinite wave periods or unresolved fine structures ( i.e. the chromosphere and lower transition region away from coronal loop footpoints , feldman 1983 , 1987 ) with much shorter wave periods do not have much alfvn wave transmission into them and so would have very low fip fractionation , as observed . using model chromospheres from vernazza , avrett , & loeser ( 1981 ) ,",
    "most of the fip fractionation is found to occur at the top of the chromosphere at altitudes with strong density gradients near the plateau regions , where low fip elements are essentially completely ionized and high fip elements are typically at least 50% ionized .",
    "the laming ( 2004 ) model thus comes about as a natural extension of existing work on alfvn wave propagation in the solar atmosphere with essentially no extra physics required .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the @xcite model using a numerical treatment of alfvn wave propagation in a coronal loop rooted in the chromosphere at each footpoint .",
    "section 2 describes this model and the improvements over @xcite with a series of illustrative examples .",
    "section 3 gives a more complete tabulation of the fip fractionation expected in a variety of elements , and section 4 gives some discussion of the implications of the new models , both for the solar coronal abundances of helium and neon , and for mhd wave origin and propagation in the solar atmosphere , before section 5 concludes .",
    "laming ( 2004 ) used a wkb approximation to treat the case of strong transmission of alfvn waves into a coronal loop , and hence evaluate the fip fractionation .",
    "here we have extend this work to a non - wkb treatment .",
    "the procedure follows that described in detail by cranmer & van ballegooijen ( 2005 ) , but applied to closed rather than open magnetic field structures .",
    "the transport equations are ( see appendix b for a derivation ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the elssser variables for inward and outward propagating alfvn waves respectively .",
    "the alfvn speed is @xmath6 , the upward flow speed in @xmath10 and the density is @xmath11 .",
    "the signed scale heights are @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in the solar chromosphere and in closed loops",
    "we may take @xmath14 .",
    "we use the same chromospheric model as before in laming ( 2004 ) , but this time also embedding it in a 2d force - free magnetic field computed from formulae given in @xcite , and shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we take a scale here of 1 unit to 1,000 km , and place the bottom of the plot at 500 km altitude in the chromosphere .",
    "the region where the plasma beta ( ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure ) equals unity is taken at 650 km altitude , or at @xmath15 in the figure .",
    "this region is where upcoming acoustic waves from the convection zone can convert to alfvn waves by mode or parametric conversion , or where downgoing alfvn waves can convert back to acoustic waves .",
    "we adopt an altitude of 650 km as the boundary of our simulations where alfvn waves are launched upwards .",
    "we consider a loop model similar to that of @xcite , the coronal portion of which is illustrated in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "waves from beneath impinge on the right hand side chromosphere - corona boundary and are either reflected back down , or transmitted into the loop .",
    "waves in the loop section bounce back and forth , with a small probability of leaking back into the chromosphere at either end .",
    "the magnetic field in the coronal loop section is uniform , and is simply the extension of chromospheric force - free field into the corona . in the current work",
    ", the non - uniformity of the magnetic field in the low chromosphere has no effect on the fip effect , since the fractionation in this work appears towards the top of the chromosphere where the magnetic field is almost parallel .",
    "the loop density is similarly extrapolated , but with a density scale height taken here to be equal to the loop length .",
    "all models presented here assume waves propagating up the @xmath16-axis at @xmath17 .",
    "equations ( 2 ) are integrated from a starting point in the left hand side chromosphere ( hereafter chromosphere `` a '' ) where alfven waves leak down into the chromosphere , back through the corona to the right hand side ( chromosphere `` b '' ) where waves are fed up from below . in this way",
    "the reflection and transmission of alfvn waves at the loop footpoints and elsewhere is naturally reconstructed .",
    "the velocity and magnetic field perturbations are calculated from @xmath18 the wave energy density and positive and negative going energy fluxes are @xmath19 and the wave peak electric field appearing in equation ( 1 ) is @xmath20    given the ponderomotive acceleration from equation ( 1 ) , the fip fractionations are calculated in a similar manner to @xcite , but with one important modification . in the momentum equations ( 10 ) and",
    "( 11 ) of @xcite , we add the motion in the wave to the ion and neutral partial pressures , so that @xmath21 where the first two terms in parentheses represent the ion thermal velocity and the microturbulent velocity in the model chromosphere , and the third term represents the motion of the ion in the alfvn wave . in true collisionless plasma , neutrals would not respond to the wave .",
    "however the solar chromosphere is sufficiently collisional that neutrals move with the ions in the wave motion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for wave frequencies well below the charge exchange rate that couples neutrals and ions , and so neutrals require the same form for their partial pressure as the ions . following the derivation through , writing @xmath22 from equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) in @xcite ( with the ponderomotive term in @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 ) we find @xmath25+\\rho_s\\left[g+\\nu _",
    "{ eff}\\left(u_s - u\\right)\\right]+\\rho _ sa\\xi _ s\\nu _ { eff}/\\nu _ { si}=0\\ ] ] where @xmath26 $ ] , with @xmath27 being the ionization fraction of element @xmath28 , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 the collision rates of ions and neutrals respectively of element @xmath28 with the ambient gas , and @xmath31 the ponderomotive acceleration .",
    "this leads to @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "we argue that in the absence of the ponderomotive acceleration @xmath31 , the effect of turbulence should be to fully mix the element composition .",
    "thus we choose @xmath34 in equation ( 7 ) such that @xmath35 to yield the fractionation by the ponderomotive force as @xmath36    as mentioned previously @xcite , the solar chromosphere is undoubtedly more active and dynamic than represented by equations ( 6 - 9 ) .",
    "however this choice allows us to model a chromosphere which in the absence of alfvn waves is completely mixed , presumably by hydrodynamic turbulence , and upon which the ponderomotive force acts to selectively accelerate chromospheric ions .",
    "chromospheric simulations excluding turbulence find huge ( and unobserved ) variations in various coronal element abundances due to ambipolar and thermal diffusion @xcite .",
    "it would appear that such abundance variations are unavoidable in the situation that the chromosphere remains undisturbed for a sufficient length of time ( days to weeks in the case of * ? ? ?",
    "we argue that hydrodynamic turbulence acts on timescales much shorter than this ( but still longer than that required to establish the fip effect ) to leave a fully mixed chromosphere in the absence of ponderomotive forces .",
    "we model the ponderomotive acceleration as acting only on the chromospheric ions , since the ponderomotive acceleration divided by the flow velocity @xmath37 s@xmath38 is much greater than the charge exchange rate ( of order 1 s@xmath38 ) .",
    "this rate should also be sufficiently greater than the turbulent mixing rate discussed above .",
    "we also use a more recent chromospheric model ( model c7 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , introduced as an update to the older valc model @xcite used previously in @xcite .",
    "we continue to evaluate photoionization rates using incident spectra based on @xcite with the extensions and modifications outlined in @xcite . in most cases , the `` very active region '' spectrum is used , being the most consistent with the underlying chromospheric model .      in the following , figures [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] , and [ fig5 ]",
    "illustrate the solutions for a loop 100,000 km long , with coronal magnetic field @xmath39 g. this yields a wavelength for 3 minute period waves approximately the same as twice the loop length , and therefore such waves can be transmitted into the coronal loop section from the chromosphere .",
    "we concentrate on 3 minute waves since unlike 5 minutes waves , these require no special conditions to propagate up into the corona @xcite . figure [ fig3 ] shows the coronal section of the loop . from top",
    "to bottom the three panels give the amplitudes of @xmath40 and @xmath41 in units of km s@xmath38 .",
    "real and imaginary parts are given as black and gray lines respectively , with @xmath41 and @xmath40 given by solid and dashed line respectively .",
    "the wave amplitude has been chosen to be @xmath42 km s@xmath38 in the corona , giving a typical spectral line fwhm consistent with observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the second panel gives the wave actions ( energy fluxes ) for the left going ( solid ) and right going ( dashed ) lines , and their difference divided by the magnetic field as a dotted line , in arbitrary units .",
    "this last quantity should be a straight horizontal line if energy is properly conserved in the calculation .",
    "the third panel gives the ponderomotive acceleration , in cm s@xmath43 . throughout the coronal section of the loop ,",
    "it is significantly lower than the gravitational acceleration .",
    "solid lines indicate positive , i.e. right going , and dashed lines indicate left going accelerations . the oscillation amplitude has been chosen to give mass motions within observational constraints @xcite , as measured from line profiles .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the same three plots for the left hand side chromosphere `` a '' , where waves leak down from the corona , together with a fourth panel showing the degree of fractionation for the abundance ratios fe / h , o / h , and he / h . the ponderomotive acceleration in the chromosphere is much larger than in the corona , especially towards the top .",
    "the most significant fractionation occurs here , increasing fe / h in this case by a factor of 1.4 over photospheric values , o / h by a factor of around 1.25 , with he / h remaining nearly unchanged .",
    "finally figure [ fig5 ] shows the same four panels for the chromosphere `` b '' on the right hand side , where the upgoing alfvn waves originate .",
    "the ponderomotive acceleration is still pointed upwards ( though is negative in the coordinate system used here ) , giving the same fip fractionations as before . in exact resonance",
    ", the chromospheric ponderomotive force behaves the same as at the opposite footpoint already shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "figures [ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] show the same variables as before , but for a loop 100,000 km long and with magnetic field @xmath44 g. now the loop is a quarter wavelength long , and almost complete reflection of the incident alfvn waves on the right hand side takes place .",
    "the simulation has been normalized so that the incident alfvn wave flux coming up from the chromosphere is about the same as for the on resonance case .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows that the coronal loop oscillation is now much weaker than before , by about a factor 20 . in the left hand chromosphere `` a '' ( figure [ fig7 ] ) negligible alfvn wave flux leaks through and no fip fractionation occurs . in the right hand",
    "chromosphere `` b '' ( figure [ fig8 ] ) , the behavior is quite different to the previous case .",
    "the ponderomotive force is now _ downwards _ pointing for most heights in the chromosphere , and it is still very small , also giving essentially no fip fractionation .",
    "the downward directed ponderomotive force might be of interest in cases where the turbulence is stronger .",
    "as reviewed in @xcite , the coronae of various active stars exhibit an inverse fip effect , where the low fips are depleted in the corona instead of being enhanced .",
    "the reversal of the ponderomotive force under these conditions is a plausible mechanism for such abundance anomalies .",
    "the first case above was designed to give a coronal nonthermal mass motion within observational limits , i.e. a root mean square @xmath45 km s@xmath38 .",
    "the upgoing energy flux of alfvn waves at the loop footpoint is @xmath46 ergs cm@xmath43 s@xmath38 , and is insufficient to power the coronal radiation power loss by one to two orders of magnitude . in this subsection",
    "we consider the same loop as in the first case , but with an alfvn wave upward energy flux of about @xmath48 ergs cm@xmath43 s@xmath38 ; sufficient to power radiation from a 100,000 km loop with a density of @xmath49 @xmath50 . the predicted nonthermal mass motions in the corona are now unphysically high , in excess of 100 km s@xmath38 , unless we are able to argue that only a small region of the corona oscillates with this speed .",
    "we discuss this further in subsection 4.1 . this is less of a problem in the transition region",
    "where the `` classical '' transition region that connects a coronal loop with the chromosphere has only recently been identified in observations @xcite , being otherwise masked by `` unresolved fine structures '' @xcite .",
    "@xcite in fact observed nonthermal line broadening in what he interprets as the `` classical '' transition region approaching the values modeled in this section , and suggests that they arise from the passage of an alfvn wave with sufficient energy flux to heat the corona . in this strong wave field ,",
    "the behavior of the fip fractionation is now subtly different , as shown in figures [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] for the left and right hand side chromospheres ( `` a '' and `` b '' ) respectively . on each side ,",
    "fe is somewhat more enhanced than in the previous case , at 3 - 3.3 .",
    "o has a fip fractionation of about 1.7 - 1.8 , similar to before , but he / h is now at about 0.8 of its photospheric value .",
    "this new behavior can be understood with reference to equation 5 , and the denominator in the integral , @xmath51 . in the case that the first two terms in @xmath52 dominate , i.e. weak alfvn turbulence , all elements ( high fips as well as low fips ) are fractionated positive to h because h has the largest thermal velocity in the denominator .",
    "when the alfvnic velocity dominates , the fractionation changes and is determined solely by the numerator in the integral . in this case",
    "the element that stays neutral the longest , he , as expected , has the lowest abundance in the corona , being depleted with respect to h. this occurs because h experiences a stronger ponderomotive enhancement .",
    "o / h is unchanged , again as expected because o and h have very similar ionization potentials and their ionization structures are locked by charge exchange reactions between them .",
    "fe remains fractionated with respect to h , by a similar amount as before .",
    "the inclusion of the alfvn turbulence in @xmath53 leads to a natural saturation of the fip effect , at about the level observed .",
    "thus for a wide range of turbulence levels , and fip effect of around 3 should be expected .",
    "the decrease in he / h is especially interesting",
    ". it might be relevant to the he abundance in the solar wind , of around 4 - 5% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) compared with a photospheric abundance of 8% , also seen in coronal holes and quiet solar corona @xcite , and is discussed further below .",
    "we put three alfvn waves with angular frequencies 0.025 , 0.022 , and 0.016 rad s@xmath38 , with relative intensities 1:0.5:0.25 in the left hand chromosphere designed to match the network power spectrum displayed in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "the loop is 100,000 km long as before , with a magnetic field of 7.1 g , which puts the 0.025 rad @xmath54 on resonance . in the first case ,",
    "fip fractionations are computed for the left hand chromosphere `` a '' , using the very active region spectrum of @xcite , and are given in table 1 .",
    "this is the region where waves leak into the chromosphere from the corona before being reflected back up again , and should give fip fractionation .",
    "the corresponding model is shown in figure 11 .",
    "there are three important differences from the tabulation given previously ( table 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "the first is that with increasing wave energy flux , the fip fractionations now appear to saturate at levels corresponding to a fractionation of low fip elements overabundant with respect to high fip elements by a factor of about 3 , and does not increase without limit .",
    "this arises from the inclusion of the term in @xmath55 in the ion and neutral partial pressures discussed above , and means that for a wide range of turbulent energy densities , similar fractionated abundances should result .",
    "the other new features , already mentioned briefly above , are the depletion in the he abundance , and at higher energy fluxes also the ne abundance relative to h. these also stem from the modification to the partial pressures .",
    "these new calculations are compared in table 1 with observations from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . @xcite",
    "give abundances measured in the slow speed solar wind during 1997/8 relative to o , relative to photospheric abundances given by @xcite .",
    "@xcite give abundances observed spectroscopically in a region of quiet solar corona , again tabulated relative to the photospheric composition of @xcite , with small modifications by @xcite . with the exceptions of mg and k , the calculated abundances agree well with those observed for a wave energy flux between one and four times that shown in figure 11 , both for the elements that are depleted , like he and ne , and for those enriched .",
    "we predict stronger fractionation in mg than is in fact observed , and stronger than in @xcite .",
    "the reason for this has been tracked to the use of the newer chromospheric model from @xcite , where h retains a higher degree of ionization lower in the chromosphere than in the previous val models .",
    "this then in turn renders the ionization of mg probably spuriously high because of charge transfer ionization with the ambient protons .",
    "the difference in ionization fraction between 0.99 and 0.95 makes a considerable impact on the fractionations that result .",
    "other low fip elements , si , and fe , do not have charge transfer ionization rates tabulated by @xcite , and so are unaffected by this change .",
    "the cause of the discrepancy for k is less clear . like",
    "na , k is very highly ionized throughout the chromosphere due to its very low fip , and should be expected to fractionate strongly , though @xcite do comment that their analysis only includes one line of k ix .",
    "the results of the calculation for the right hand side chromosphere `` b '' are given in figure 12 .",
    "the loop model chosen is resonant with the 0.025 angular frequency wave , and this is the component transmitted into the corona .",
    "however the fip fractionation is significantly reduced by the presence of the other wave frequencies which are reflected from the corona . in the right hand",
    "chromosphere `` b '' the weaker components on the left are now the strongest .",
    "this does not produce much change in the ponderomotive acceleration , but increases the term @xmath55 in the denominator of the integrand in equation 6 , thereby reducing the fractionation .",
    "a wave source in the chromosphere is unlikely to be monochromatic , and so this situation of partial transmission and partial reflection with the reduced fip fractionation will be ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere .",
    "this does not agree with observations , for which chromosphere `` a '' is a much better match .",
    "we therefore argue that if the fip effect is due to the ponderomotive force of alfvn waves in the chromosphere , these must have a source in the corona .",
    "we return to this thought in subsection 4.1 .",
    "although this calculation has been done for a closed loop , we expect that this chromospheric wave pattern will also arise at the footpoint of an open field line in a coronal hole .",
    "in fact the character of our chromospheric solution matches well with that found in the open field case by @xcite , subsequently shown in @xcite to exhibit fip fractionation similar to that observed in the fast solar wind .",
    "we emphasize this point by showing in figures 14 and 15 the coronal and chromospheric portions of an open field flux tube . in this case",
    "we start the integration at an altitude of @xmath56 km with purely outgoing waves , and work back to the solar surface .",
    "this restricts us to the region where the solar wind outflow speed is still much lower than the alfvn speed , in keeping with our assumption of @xmath14 above .",
    "we take magnetic field from @xcite , modified by @xcite , and choose a density scale height to match the observed and modeled density profiles in @xcite .",
    "figure 14 shows @xmath40 and @xmath57 , chosen to match the observational and modeling constraints in @xcite .",
    "figure 15 shows the extension of these variables into chromosphere `` b '' , in a similar manner to the previous figures .",
    "while there is much more to be said about the wave properties in open field lines , the important point to be made here is that the ponderomotive force naturally produces a very small fractionation in this geometry .",
    "this is consistent with observed abundances in the fast solar wind @xcite and in coronal holes @xcite .",
    "a tabulation of coronal hole fractionations is given in table 2 , in a similar format to that in table 1 , using the coronal hole incident spectrum of @xcite .",
    "it appears from the forgoing that the abundance anomalies observed in various regions of the solar corona may yield inferences on the energy fluxes of alfvn waves in the chromosphere .",
    "our initial considerations then imply that wave energy fluxes sufficient to heat the solar corona or accelerate the solar wind are necessary to produce the correct fractionation .",
    "energy fluxes observed in slow mode and fast mode waves are not sufficient to heat the solar corona @xcite .",
    "the detection of alfvn waves , the favored mode for transporting energy to the solar corona , is much harder , since they are incompressible and can only be revealed through doppler shifts or motions , which become hard to see in inhomogeneous conditions where alfvn waves on neighboring flux surfaces can propagate at different speeds and lose phase coherence .",
    "however @xcite claim the detection of alfvn waves in the solar corona , albeit with insufficient energy flux to heat the corona .",
    "@xcite argue that the detected waves are in fact kink mode waves , for the reasons suggested above .",
    "@xcite observe transverse waves in the chromosphere , which they argue should be interpreted as alfvn waves in the absence of a chromospheric waveguide .",
    "however these waves are inferred from the observed oscillations of spicules , which clearly have radial structure . the energy flux detected by these authors",
    "@xmath46 ergs cm@xmath43 s@xmath38 is close to being sufficient to heat the solar corona or accelerate the solar wind .    in this paper",
    "we argue that the fip effect is due to the ponderomotive force associated with transverse waves in the chromosphere .",
    "longitudinal mhd waves do not generate electric field . in order to generate the observed fip fractionation ,",
    "the energy fluxes associated with these waves need to be of order @xmath58 ergs cm@xmath43 s@xmath38 , much closer to those required for coronal heating .",
    "it is clear that fip fractionation is associated with the transmission of waves between the chromosphere and the corona , and correspondingly we argue that the required transverse waves should be identified as alfvn waves to meet this condition .",
    "the fast mode totally internally reflects somewhere in the transition region or low corona ( schwartz & leroy 1982 , leroy & schwartz 1982 ) .",
    "the nonthermal mass motions predicted in the coronal section of this loop are higher than observed . in the transition region , this is not necessarily a problem since ample evidence exists to show that the `` classical '' transition regions of coronal loops are rarely observed , being masked as they are by a population of smaller `` unresolved fine structures '' @xcite . in the corona , this may also be true if the heating occurs in thin filament or shells as in alfvn resonance models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while the rest of the emitting loop undergoes much slower oscillations .",
    "another possibility might be the generation of turbulence following coronal reconnection events associated with nanoflares @xcite . in each case",
    "it is likely that the turbulence would actually be produced in the coronal section of the loop , not in the chromosphere , and will also be in resonance with the loop .",
    "this also appears to be the conclusion to be drawn from section 3 .",
    "chromosphere `` a '' where waves leak down from the corona before being reflected back again gives stronger and more consistent fip fractionations for a wide variety of wave spectra than chromosphere `` b '' , where waves are incident upwards on the loop from the chromosphere below .",
    "we therefore argue that the fip effect is more likely to arise with a coronal source of alfvn waves , rather than a chromospheric source as originally conceived in @xcite , and that this inference will constrain the means by which the corona may be heated .",
    "the fractionations computed in this paper differ from those in @xcite in three notable ways .",
    "first , as the turbulent energy density increases , the fractionation does not increase without limit but saturates at values broadly consistent with those observed .",
    "this is due to a refinement in our formalism discussed above , where the wave oscillation velocity is included in the ion and neutral partial pressures in equation 3 .",
    "the second is that at high turbulence levels , he becomes significantly depleted relative to h. comparing tables 1 and 2 , we find a stronger depletion in the coronal loop , representative of the slow speed solar wind , than we would in a coronal hole , the source of the fast wind .",
    "the abundance ratio he / h in the fast solar wind is fairly constant at about 5% @xcite , or a depletion of 0.59 from the photospheric value of 8.5% .",
    "he / h in the slow speed solar is lower , and generally more variable .",
    "@xcite and @xcite find he / h varying with wind speed , with these variations being more pronounced at solar minimum , where he / h @xmath59 for speeds below 300 km s@xmath38 , approaching 4.5% for speeds above 500 km s@xmath38 . at solar maximum , he / h is always in the range 3.5 - 5% .",
    "@xcite also find a dependence on heliographic latitude during periods of solar minimum , with lower he / h being found closer to the heliographic equator .",
    "table 1 gives values of he / h down to about 3.5% .",
    "overall though , our modeled values for the abundance ratio he / h are very encouragingly consistent with observations , lending confidence to our approach .",
    "the third , and most controversial new feature is the similar depletion predicted for ne .",
    "this was originally suggested by @xcite from a survey of the ne / o abundance ratio in a sample of late - type stellar coronae , as a solution to the problem in helioseismology presented by the reduction in the solar photospheric abundance of o ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". specifically , @xcite the depth of the solar convection zone demands a metallicity higher than that coming from the standard solar composition , with the o abundance revised downwards by nearly a factor of 1.5 @xcite from @xcite .",
    "ne , having no photospheric lines on which to base an abundance measurement , was suggested as the element most likely to resolve this by having a higher postulated abundance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite find coronal ne / o typically @xmath60 in stars which exhibit either no fip effect or an inverse fip effect , and argued that the general consistency of ne / o among their sample of 21 stars suggests no significant fractionation between ne and o here between photosphere and corona .",
    "the solar coronal abundance ratio ne / o , measured at @xmath61 @xcite would imply therefore that ne is depleted in the solar corona relative to the photosphere , similarly to he .",
    "our calculations in table 1 provide some support to this view , especially at higher turbulence levels , where ne / o is about 0.5 of its photospheric value .",
    "one main feature of laming ( 2004 ) model and the calculations presented above is that the fractionation is predicted to occur relatively high up in the chromosphere , at altitudes greater than 2000 km .",
    "however in the literature there are already indications that , at least in active regions and flares , that fractionation should set in lower down .    in an analysis of hrts",
    "ii ( the naval research laboratory s high resolution telescope and spectrograph ) data , athay ( 1994 ) observed variations in the c i 1561  /fe ii 1563   line intensity ratio .",
    "compared to plage regions around a sunspot , the sunspot itself has a higher ratio c i / fe ii , while surrounding c i dark flocculi have a lower ratio .",
    "similar results are found by doschek , dere & lund ( 1991 ) and feldman , widing & lund ( 1990 ) .",
    "this absence of fractionation in the sunspot presumably relates to the absence of acoustic waves in sunspots ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because convection is inhibited by the strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the fact that this is observed in lines of c i and fe ii suggests that fractionation must set in at lower altitudes than originally modeled by laming ( 2004 ; see figure 1 ( left and right panels ) , where o and c are becoming ionized in the region of fractionation , and one would expect neutral o i and c i to be emitted from lower , unfractionated layers ) .",
    "the existence of fractionation at these low altitudes also offers a possible explanation of the observation by phillips et al .",
    "( 1994 ) who found rather small difference in the abundances of fe determined from soft x - ray flare plasma , compared with that lower down in the atmosphere , determined from the fe k@xmath62 fluorescent line , rather than the strong fip effect expected .",
    "more recently murphy & share ( 2005 ) studied @xmath63-ray emission from flares .",
    "protons accelerated into the chromosphere by the flare excite @xmath63-ray emission from the ambient plasma when its density reaches about @xmath64 @xmath50 .",
    "element abundances determined from the resulting @xmath63-ray spectrum show the presence of a fip fractionation .",
    "the densities at which this occurs correspond to the low chromosphere where sound and alfvn speeds are approximately equal , and certainly not the lyman @xmath65 plateau region where fractionation is expected in the laming ( 2004 ) model . a search for fip fractionation in photospheric lines i.e. below the chromosphere ( sheminova & solanki 1999 ) reveals very little , if any fractionation .",
    "thus all available observational evidence suggests that the low chromosphere as another plausible place for fip fractionation to occur .",
    "we speculate that the growth of alfvn waves from sound waves near the @xmath66 layer will give an extra ponderomotive force in this region that can account for this .",
    "zaqarashvili & roberts ( 2006 ) give a treatment of the parametric conversion of sound waves into alfvn waves which requires @xmath67 when both are traveling in the same direction along the magnetic field .",
    "this distinguishes it from the phenomenon of mode conversion , which requires nonzero wavevector perpendicular to the magnetic field to proceed ( e.g. mcdougall & hood 2007 ) , and parametric conversion lower down in high @xmath62 plasma where the sound waves must be oblique @xcite .",
    "waves impinging on the chromosphere from below are fast magnetoacoustic waves from the high @xmath62 ( gas pressure / magnetic pressure ) solar interior . in the absence of mode conversion ,",
    "these retain their acoustic character propagating as a slow mode wave when @xmath68 further up in the chromosphere ( mcdougall & hood 2007 ) .",
    "at the altitude where @xmath69 ( i.e. where the phase speeds of magnetic and acoustic waves are similar ) these waves can mode convert into other mhd wave modes ( bogdan et al .",
    "this would be consistent with the findings of sheminova & solanki ( 1999 ) , who find essentially no fip effect at photospheric altitudes .",
    "acoustic waves will produce no ponderomotive force , and only once mode conversion to the other mhd modes has occurred can fractionation proceed .",
    "in conclusion then we have refined the model of @xcite for fip fractionations arising from the ponderomotive force as alfvn waves propagate through the chromosphere .",
    "we have implemented a non - wkb treatment of the wave transport , which can be further modified to include the effects of wave growth and damping , and made a correction to the previous formalism to include the alfvn wave transverse velocity in the chromospheric ion and neutral partial pressures .",
    "the new effects are a saturation of the fip effect at the correct level , and predicted depletions in the coronal abundances of he and ne , again consistent with observations .",
    "we find the best match to the observed coronal or solar wind element abundances arises for models with an alfvn wave energy fluxes sufficient to heat the corona or accelerate the solar wind .",
    "the inference that a coronal source of alfvn waves provides a fip effect better matching the observations suggests that coronal abundance anomalies may provide novel insights into the coronal heating mechanism(s ) .",
    "this work was supported by nasa contract nng05hl39i , and by basic research funds of the office of naval research .",
    "i thank daniel savin , cara rakowski and an anonymous referee for comments on the manuscript .",
    "the ponderomotive force arises from the effects of wave refraction in an inhomogeneous plasma . in a nonmagnetic plasma , the refractive index , @xmath70 ,",
    "is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the plasma frequency .",
    "waves are refracted to high refractive index , which means low plasma density .",
    "the increased wave pressure can then expel even more plasma from the low density region , leading to ducting instabilities . in magnetic plasma , @xmath73 , where @xmath1 is the ion cyclotron frequency .",
    "thus waves refract to high density regions , and plasma is attracted to regions of high wave energy density .",
    "a simple expression for the ponderomotive force on an ion may be derived as follows .",
    "the lagrangian density for a system of thermal plasma of density @xmath74 with particle mass @xmath4 and waves is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the thermal speed and @xmath77 is the oscillatory speed induced by the wave of particle @xmath78 , with mass @xmath79 , and charge @xmath80 .",
    "wave electric and magnetic fields are given by @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively , and @xmath83 is the vector potential .",
    "we have omitted the interaction term involving the electrostatic potential , since this is constant in a neutral plasma .",
    "putting @xmath84 and @xmath85 for mhd waves , then @xmath86 the `` @xmath87 '' euler - lagrange equation gives @xmath88 neglecting the spatial variation of @xmath89 and hence @xmath90 , and evaluating for the component of @xmath76 orthogonal to @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this is the same as the expression derived by landau , lifshitz & pitaevskii ( 1984 ) , and agrees with earlier work ( e.g. lee & parks 1983 ) if @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the peak electric field in the wave , giving a ponderomotive force @xmath95 when @xmath96 , the ponderomotive acceleration is thus _ independent of ion mass _ , which is one crucial property relevant to obtaining an almost mass independent fractionation as observed .",
    "it is also independent of ion change , so long as the ion is charged ( and not neutral ) .",
    "litwin & rosner ( 1998 ) give a similar expression derived from the @xmath97 term in the mhd momentum equation .",
    "we start from the linearized mhd force and induction equations , @xmath98 and @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath92 are the unperturbed velocity and magnetic field , @xmath101 and @xmath82 are the perturbations , and @xmath102 is the density .",
    "equation ( b1 ) is rewritten using @xmath103 to yield @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the alfvn velocity .",
    "writing @xmath106 since @xmath107 ( assuming @xmath108 ) , and similarly for @xmath109 , and using @xmath110 gives @xmath111 here @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and below @xmath114 .",
    "similar manipulations give the induction equation in the form @xmath115 taking equation ( b4 ) plus or minus equation ( b5 ) and rearranging gives the final result , @xmath8 where @xmath116 , representing waves propagating in the @xmath117 z - directions .",
