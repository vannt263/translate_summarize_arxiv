    "the quantum teleportation phenomenon @xcite has become one of the central aspects in the investigations of quantum entanglement .",
    "its possible applicability for quantum communication and its experimental realization in different physical systems @xcite gave rise to a wide spread interest in several related problems , including possible alternative schemes @xcite , discussion and resolution of experimental and theoretical limitations @xcite and the connection to nonlocality and inseparability @xcite .",
    "the relation of nonlocality and inseparability of mixed states has already been a challenging problem before the advent of quantum teleportation .",
    "werner @xcite introduced inseparable mixed states which do not violate bell s inequalities .",
    "several measures have been defined to quantify the amount of entanglement contained in mixed states @xcite , partly inspired by entanglement distillation protocols @xcite . whether it is possible to employ",
    "a bipartite mixed state for quantum teleportation has turned out to be an additional nontrivial question in this field @xcite .",
    "recently , bose and vedral @xcite have investigated the direct relation between the mixedness of a state and its usefulness for teleportation .",
    "they applied the von neumann entropy @xmath0 as a measure for mixedness , and find that there is a threshold for this quantity above which the bipartite state @xmath1 becomes useless for teleportation .",
    "in order to separate the quantum and classical aspects of communication , n. and b. gisin @xcite and independently steiner @xcite have presented a local hidden variable ( lhv ) model which , supplied by classical communication , is capable of reproducing quantum correlations of two spin 1/2 particles in singlet state .",
    "brassard et al .",
    "@xcite quantify the amount of classical communication required to be supplemented to simulate quantum correlations for given numbers of qubits .",
    "more recently , cerf et al .",
    "@xcite have presented a protocol in an lhv model for teleporting a quantum state via classical communication . on the other hand , m. .",
    "zukowski @xcite has investigated the connection of local realism and the nonclassical part quantum teleportation process , and concluded , that no local hidden variable model can reproduce the quantum prediction .",
    "the effect of mixedness of a bipartite state applied for teleportation is obviously an important aspect in understanding the classical  quantum limit .",
    "the classical limit of the original protocol of bennett has not yet been investigated .",
    "quantum teleportation , the basic primitive of quantum communication networks consists of the transmission of a quantum state via a combination of classical channels and quantum correlations . in lack of either the classical channel or the entangled resource ,",
    "only noise is obtained .",
    "but what is the classical analogue of bennett s scheme ? to answer this question , we investigate a set of bipartite states interpolating between an ideal entangled state and a possible classical limit .",
    "this approach provides a transition from the quantum teleportation to its classical counterpart .    in this paper",
    "we examine , what happens to a teleportation scheme , when the density matrix elements of the entangled state used as a correlated pair , which are off - diagonal on product basis , are reduced .",
    "this approach , turning the entangled state into a classical correlation , obviously offers a possible way of obtaining a classical limit of the teleportation process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : telep ] the class of bipartite states in argument is described , and bennett s protocol of quantum teleportation of a qubit is summarized in a consistent density matrix formalism .",
    "the latter can be regarded as a special case of the treatment of e. g. @xcite or @xcite . by replacing the ideal epr pair with the states investigated ,",
    "we obtain our main result . starting from this ,",
    "two examples are studied in detail : in section [ sec : class ] the purely classical limit is introduced , and in section [ sec : stat ] cases between the ideal quantum teleportation and the classical limit are analyzed by examining a gedankenexperiment .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] summarizes the results .",
    "we restrict ourselves to two - level systems , and use the terminology of spin-@xmath2 particles .",
    "the results can be applied to any representation of qubits , e. g. for the polarization of single photon states , for which quantum teleportation is experimentally feasible @xcite .",
    "the spin @xmath3-component eigenstates of the particles are denoted by @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "density matrices of the bipartite systems , if not otherwise stated , are represented on the natural product state basis @xmath6 .",
    "we will also use the notation @xmath7 for the four bell - states .    let us examine bennett s scheme of quantum teleportation @xcite of a qubit : the sender , alice has particle 1 of @xmath2 spin in the state @xmath8 and wants to teleport it to bob .",
    "the upper indices of density matrices ( and other operators ) refer to the number assigned to the particles .",
    "they share particles 2 and 3 in a state @xmath9 as an entangled resource , and there is also a classical communication channel between them .",
    "alice has an ideal bell - state detector , and bob can carry out unitary transformations on particle 3 given to him . as a starting point of our investigation , let us suppose , that the state of particles 2 and 3 is described by the following density matrix : @xmath10 the lower indices in the kets indicate the number assigned to the particles .",
    "let @xmath11 be real parameter between @xmath12 and @xmath13 . for @xmath14 , @xmath15 ,",
    "thus in this case alice and bob share an epr pair .",
    "this is the case of ideal quantum teleportation . otherwise , the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix are multiplied by @xmath16 . for @xmath17",
    "the density matrix is diagonal in the product state basis , describing classical statistics only .",
    "this state is the mixture of the product states @xmath18 .",
    "such a state can be generated by a _ classically stochastic _ source emitting particles with opposite spins , with equal probability of sending `` up '' and `` down '' state both for particles 2 and 3 .",
    "the states in equation ( [ eq : entangled ] ) may be rewritten in the bell - basis , we find @xmath19 that is , the state is a mixture of the two @xmath20 bell - states .",
    "the class of states examined here is a subclass of werner states ( which were examined from teleportation s point of view in references  @xcite ) where the two @xmath21 states do not occur .",
    "let us consider now the entire teleportation process .",
    "initially , the state of the whole system of the three particles is the product of the states in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : instate ] ) and ( [ eq : entangled ] ) : @xmath22 alice carries out a bell - state measurement , which is described by one of the operators including projection of subsystems 1 and 2 to a bell - state , @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for one of the four bell - states , and @xmath25 is the identity operator for the hilbert - space of particle 3 .",
    "the result of the measurement is @xmath26 , corresponding to the @xmath26-th bell - state .",
    "this information is sent to bob via the classical channel . because the detection of each bell - state occurs with probability @xmath27",
    ", the operator is multiplied by @xmath28 in order to preserve the norm of the state obtained .",
    "the state of the system after the measurement is given by applying the operator in equation  ( [ eq : bellmeas ] ) to the state in equation  ( [ eq : in123 ] ) . from this",
    "we obtain the state of bob s particle by tracing out in the other two particles : @xmath29 in the last step , bob has to apply a unitary transformation @xmath30 on state @xmath31 , according to alice s measurement result @xmath26 , which is the identity operator in case alice has detected @xmath32 , and @xmath33 for detecting @xmath34,@xmath35 , and @xmath36 respectively . carrying out the calculations described , we obtain our main result : the state teleported to bob reads @xmath37 it can be seen that _ the reduction of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix describing the entangled resource is inherited by the teleported state .",
    "_ thus teleportation acts as a phase - damping channel .",
    "as a first example , let us examine the case of `` teleporting '' a classical bit .",
    "assume , that @xmath17 , that is the density matrix describing the entangled resource is diagonal . according to ( [ eq : result ] ) , only the diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix of the input state , i.e. the statistics of the measurement of the spin-@xmath3 component is preserved .",
    "therefore , let us suppose , that the input state in equation  ( [ eq : instate ] ) is already diagonal : @xmath38 . in this section we consider measurement of the @xmath3 components of the spins .    under these circumstances our particles can be exactly identified with classical bits .",
    "the states of these classical bits , denoted by @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , are identical with the basis quantum states @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the diagonal density matrix of the input quantum state describes a classical probability distribution of bit 1 .",
    "this is transferred into bit 3 via a classical communication channel and a _ classical _ correlation .",
    "the process itself can be interpreted in the following way : the source of bits 2 and 3 broadcasts correlated bit - pairs @xmath41 or @xmath42 with equal probability .",
    "this can be regarded as the classical limit of an epr - pair .",
    "bit 2 is obtained by alice , who makes a measurement , which tells whether bit 1 and 2 are the same or different .",
    "one can not speak of superpositions in this classical context , and therefore the two @xmath20 and the two @xmath21 bell - states coincide in this limit : the former two mean simply `` the two bits are different '' ( @xmath20-detection ) , and the latter `` the two bits are the same '' ( @xmath21-detection ) . thus the bell - state measurement degenerates to an `` exclusive or '' operation , resulting in a single bit of information , communicated to bob .",
    "bob has to carry out the proper transformation to regain the `` teleported '' bit .",
    "there is no phase of the probability amplitudes for classical probability , thus the transformations in equation  ( [ eq : u ] ) degenerate to a conditional not operation : in case of `` @xmath20 detection '' , bob has obtained bit 3 in the proper state , while in case of `` @xmath21 detection '' he has to invert bit 3 .",
    "finally bit 3 is left with the original value of bit 1 .",
    "since the values of bits 1 or 2 are irrelevant from the `` bell - state measurement '' , it is not necessary for alice to be aware of the actual value of bit 1 to be `` teleported '' .",
    "therefore the method works for `` teleporting '' an unknown classical bit as well , similarly to the quantum protocol .    the classical protocol described here is well known as the one - time - pad in classical cryptography @xcite .",
    "this is , in some sense , the classical protocol most similar to quantum teleportation .",
    "it is the `` teleportation '' of the ( optionally unknown ) state of a classical bit via a classical communication channel and a classical correlation .",
    "the classical correlation provides noise in the lack of the classical communication channel , while the classical channel itself is useless for reconstruction of the result without the correlation .",
    "note that instead of measuring the state of bit 1 and simply communicating its value , only a comparison with a reference has been made .",
    "having described the classical analogue , we may now examine @xmath43 , which interpolates between the classical and the quantum case .",
    "we calculate the consequence of ( [ eq : result ] ) to the result of a teleportation experiment . for simplicity ,",
    "let us suppose , that we want to teleport the state @xmath44 , having @xmath3-component of @xmath45 , rotated by a given angle @xmath46 around the @xmath47 axis of the coordinate system .",
    "the operator of this rotation ( @xmath48 ) is @xmath49 @xmath50 being the first pauli - matrix , and thus we have the state @xmath51 to be teleported . according to ( [ eq : result ] ) , we obtain @xmath52 as result of the teleportation process . in order to verify the teleportation , one may measure the spin along an axis obtained by rotating the @xmath3 axis with the angle @xmath53 around the x axis .",
    "the probability of finding this component of the spin @xmath45 is in this case is @xmath54 for @xmath14 we obtain the familiar cosine - type result valid for ideal teleportation , @xmath55 which is equal to @xmath13 for @xmath56 , meaning perfect teleportation to any direction . for a given input state @xmath57 , the probability for finding the output in the input state after the teleportation is the fidelity of the teleportation of the input state .",
    "this fidelity is @xmath58.\\ ] ] in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] we have plotted this function .",
    "it is equal to 1 in the case of ideal teleportation .",
    "the basis states @xmath59 and @xmath60 are always properly teleported , as we have seen in the classical case .",
    "the minimum of the fidelity for any @xmath16 occurs for the equal superposition of the two basis states ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the minimum value for @xmath17 is @xmath2 , expressing that the result of the measurement can be either @xmath62 or @xmath63 with equal probability , thus this state is not at all teleported .",
    "increasing the purity of the mixed state increases the domain of the angles in which teleportation can be regarded as reliable .",
    "we have studied the role of the off - diagonal density matrix elements of the entangled pair in the teleportation of a qubit . by setting these to zero ,",
    "we have obtained the classical one - time pad cypher , as a classical limit of quantum teleportation .",
    "we have demonstrated the result on the behavior of statistics and fidelity of a gedankenexperiment .",
    "we have found , that the fidelity of the teleportation is most sensitive to the loss of the quantum entanglement in the epr pair for a state at a right angle to the quantization direction .",
