    "magnetic white dwarfs comprise @xmath15% of all white dwarfs and have surface field strengths in the range @xmath13@xmath210@xmath3 to 10@xmath4 gauss ( g ) .",
    "the 65 isolated ( non - interacting binary ) cases known at the time of the review of wickramasinghe & ferrario ( 2000 ) cover most of the white dwarf spectral types ( eg . da , db , dq , dc ) , but have up to now not included any dz stars which show lines of heavy elements like ca , mg , na and fe .",
    "this has restricted their use as astrophysical laboratories of the effects of strong magnetic fields on the light elements hydrogen , helium and molecular carbon .",
    "the subject of this paper is the discovery of the first magnetic dz object , identified in the course of routine spectral classification of cool stars from the luyten half second ( 1979 , lhs ) proper motion catalog .",
    "we present in @xmath52 the spectrum of this object , lhs  2534 ( wd  1221 - 023 , using the notation of mccook & sion 1999 ) .",
    "this dwarf offers the first empirical data in an astrophysical setting of the zeeman effect on neutral na , mg , and both ionized and neutral ca .",
    "the optical spectrum of the new magnetic white dwarf was obtained on 8 february 1998 using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris , oke et al .",
    "1994 ) at the 10 m w. m. keck observatory ( keck - ii ) on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "these observations were made as part of a service observing request .",
    "the 300 g / mm grating blazed at 5000    was used with a one arc second slit to obtain spectra of 6  resolution covering @xmath6   . a single 900-second exposure was obtained , and the data are plotted in figure  1 .",
    "in addition to being magnetic , lhs  2534 is one of the most heavily - blanketed of the known cool dz white dwarfs .",
    "the temperature is evidently not too different from that of the sun , as the strongest features  3933 , 3968   , 4226   , 5175   , and 5892aa   are also among the strongest in the optical spectrum of the sun .",
    "hydrogen , especially h@xmath7 , is not detected , so one may conclude the star has a helium - dominated atmosphere , like most dz stars .",
    "monochromatic magnitudes for many cool white dwarfs were measured using the palomar multichannel spectrophotometer colors and published by oke ( 1974 ) and greenstein ( 1976 ) ; the colors b(4255   ) , g(4717   ) , v(5405   ) , r(6944   ) and i(8000   ) overlap the wavelength range of these spectra .",
    "synthetic colors from the pure helium atmosphere models of bergeron , wesemael , & beauchamp ( 1995 ) may be compared .",
    "the v - i slope is probably least affected by metallic absorption .",
    "the measured value of + 0.24 from our spectrum compares with + 0.266 for a 6,000  k log g=8 atmosphere , and + 0.152 at 6,500  k. from this we may conclude that lhs  2534 has a @xmath8 near 6,000  k. the star is clearly warmer than the heavily - blanketed lp  701 - 29 ( dahn et al 1978 ) for which kapranidis & liebert ( 1986 ) estimated @xmath9  k. the v - i measurement of greenstein ( 1984 ) suggests @xmath14,800  k from the pure - helium models .",
    "both g - r and especially b - v are substantially redder than the pure - he models predict .",
    "likewise , lhs  2534 is cooler than the heavily - blanketed dz star g  165 - 7 , for which wehrse & liebert ( 1980 ) estimated 7,500  k and the v - i color ( greenstein 1984 ) suggests 7,100  k. perhaps the most similar of the well known dz stars is van  maanen  2 , at g - r = + 0.26 and v - i = + 0.13 .",
    "bergeron , ruiz & leggett ( 1997 ) estimate 6,770  k from fitting a multi - color energy distribution of this star .",
    "the zeeman effect on neutral sodium is a classic problem ( zeeman 1897 ) that is encountered here for the first time in regard to white dwarfs .",
    "thus , we briefly summarize the situation .",
    "sodium is isoelectronic with hydrogen , so magnetic effects involve only the single valence electron .",
    "the d@xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and d@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) lines comprise a resonance doublet that couples the @xmath14 term with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . the feature is also seen in g  165 - 7 ( hintzen & strittmatter 1974 , wehrse & liebert 1980 ) , where the doublet splitting can not be resolved due to pressure broadening .    in a weak magnetic field",
    "( @xmath17  g ) , the @xmath18 levels are each split into 2 sublevels , and the @xmath19 level splits into 5 according to @xmath20 , and the magnitude of the splitting is computed according to ls coupling .",
    "ten distinct components result .",
    "this is the regime normally encountered in solar observations ( e.g. , beckers 1969 ; caccin , gomez , & severino 1993 ) .",
    "the spin and orbit decouple when the splitting due to the external magnetic field overwhelms that due to the fine - structure effect . in figure  1",
    ", the feature appears as a strong triplet at @xmath215862 , 5892 , and 5924 . the observed splitting is not only considerably larger than the 6    fine - structure effect , but the pattern is centered near the mean wavelength of the nonmagnetic doublet .",
    "hence , we conclude that the paschen - back approximation is appropriate and we analyze the feature as an ordinary linear zeeman triplet with an insignificant quadratic component .",
    "the displacements of the @xmath22 components are then @xmath23  @xmath24 and @xmath2592  @xmath24 for @xmath265862 and @xmath265924 , respectively .",
    "( it is customary in atomic spectroscopy to use wavenumber units . ) from the linear zeeman effect , the mean surface field ( cf .",
    "garstang 1977 ) is computed according to @xmath27 which yields an average value for the two components of @xmath28  g = 1.92  mg . there are , in fact , direct laboratory measurements of the d lines which overlap this field strength and corroborate the accuracy of the linear approximation .",
    "garn et al .",
    "( 1966 ) reported splittings between the @xmath22 components that from 30    for a longitudinal field of 0.94  mg up to 163    at 5.1  mg .",
    "our measurement of 1.92  mg is the mean surface field strength .",
    "detailed modeling of the line profile , preferably supported with spectropolarimetric observations , is necessary to draw conclusions about the field geometry .",
    "a dipolar geometry is usually an adequate approximation , though the pattern is often offset significantly from the center of the star .",
    "time - dependent observations might determine if the star rotates , and allow the modeling of periodic changes in the geometric view .",
    "both @xmath22 components and , to a lesser extent , the @xmath29 component should be circularly polarized , while linear polarization and polarization of the continuum should be small .",
    "the subordinate triplet connects levels @xmath30 with @xmath31 for @xmath215167.3 , 5172.7 , 5183.6 , respectively . in lhs  2534",
    "the region shows 4 principal components at wavelengths of @xmath15149   , 5180   , 5205   , and 5235   . modeling each component of the parent triplet as a simple zeeman triplet in a field of @xmath32  mg",
    "indeed produces a complex with only 4 lines due to overlapping of some of the 9 components .",
    "the short - wavelength edge matches that of the data , but the splitting between lines is somewhat less than observed and thus the feature does not extend sufficiently far to the red .",
    "we take this as evidence that the linear zeeman approximation has broken down for this ion , where the fine - structure effect is comparable to the magnetic interaction .",
    "we are aware of no computations of the behavior of in this intermediate regime .",
    "the ion is isoelectronic with , but has spin - orbit splitting which even exceeds that of the features and results in the well - known `` h '' ( 3933   ) and `` k '' ( 3968   ) doublet components being well - resolved even at low spectral resolution in zero field . since the linear magnetic term in the hamiltonian is thus comparable to the spin - orbit term , the splitting at such a low field is more complicated still .",
    "calculations have been published by kemic ( 1975 ) . at a field strength of 1.9  mg , the 10 zeeman components of the doublet group themselves into 3 features centered around @xmath33 , and comprised primarily of transitions from upper levels @xmath16 @xmath34 , @xmath16 @xmath35 , and @xmath15 @xmath36",
    "these are heavily blended for the observed line widths , and together result in the broad depression centered near 3957   .",
    "strong absorption features due to and many other heavy elements are prominent in the spectra of late type stars shortward of 4000   , and may also contribute in lhs  2534 .",
    "finally , the strong neutral calcium resonance line at 4226    shows a complex structure , and any magnetic components are severely blended .",
