    "the wires have been coated galvanically with silver to increase the wire diameter from 50@xmath1 m to 150@xmath1 m in order to avoid gas amplification .",
    "the trigger is made of a coincidence of four scintillation counters which cover an area of 1 cm ( along the wires ) @xmath43 6 cm (= two tubes in height ) and are placed in the middle of the active part of the tubes .",
    "+ the whole setup can be moved horizontally by a stepper motor within a range of 1 m from the centre of the muon beam . by moving the apparatus with respect to the beam",
    "one can adjust the trigger rate from 10hz/@xmath0 up to more than 10khz/@xmath0 .",
    "whereas in atlas the tubes will be read out with tdcs , here the full analog pulse information was read out with 250 mhz flash adcs @xcite .",
    "this is necessary for measuring pulse height reductions and to be independent of a fixed discriminator threshold .",
    "+    an important property of the data acquisition was the ability to record at least 8 successive tracks without dead time .",

    "it is also used to observe effects coming from event - to - event fluctuations where the `` history '' of the tube has to be known .",

    "+ in order to achieve this readout without dead time , a trigger logic has been set up that does not need any readout cycle between the first and eighth event trigger . the memory depth of the flash adc is 2048 bytes per channel corresponding to 8192 ns in time which is large enough to store the waveforms of 8 pulses .",
    "the digitization of the flash adcs is started for each new muon trigger and stopped after 1@xmath1s .",
    "+    the time differences between consecutive triggers were measured with a setup of slow tdcs ( clock ) covering a time range of @xmath44 20 ms . with this information it is possible to compute for every tube the time differences to the last hit .",

    "a typical size for the data that had to be read out after every cycle ( 8 events ) was 40 kb .",
    "the data were processed by a vme processor operated under os9 and stored on an exabyte tape . to maximize the readout speed , all time critical routines",
    "have been written in assembler code .",
    "the maximum readout rate that could be achieved ( if the particle rate was high enough ) was @xmath46 events within one spill of the cern sps accelerator ( 2.4s beam followed by a pause of ) and was limited by the speed of the tape drive .",
    "the time needed to take a high statistics run ( 800.000 triggers ) at highest rates was 4 hours .",
    "+ a slow control system was installed to monitor the relevant parameters such as temperature , gas flow , gas mixture , pressure and the high voltages of the tubes .",
    "+ the measurement of drift times with this kind of flash adc needs a special setup .",
    "the time difference between incoming start signal and start of the digitization can vary randomly between 0 and 12ns . in order to get a precise time marker ,",
    "the trigger signal starting the readout was delayed by 800 ns and fed into the test input of the preamplifiers fbpanik-04 @xcite .",
    "thus , every drift chamber pulse was followed by a reference pulse coming always with the same delay with respect to the muon trigger .",
    "the time difference between the pulse and the reference pulse is the drift time plus a constant offset t@xmath47 .",
    "+ the time bins of the flash adcs have a width of 4 ns . to get a better time resolution of the pulse , the dos ( difference of samples ) method was used which was developed for the analysis of the flash adc data of the opal experiment@xcite .",
    "this method is numerically rather simple but very efficient in both finding pulses and calculating the drift time with an accuracy better than 1ns .",
    "first , the pulse shape is differentiated by subtracting the pulse heights of successive bins .",
    "then pulses can be found if the differentiated pulse reaches a certain threshold .",
    "finally the drift time is calculated as the weighted mean of the differentiated pulse around the position of the maximum of the differentiated pulse . + an event display of a muon passing the chamber is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig = eventdisplay ] . +",
    "in order to measure the correct gain drop that is only due to particle rate one has to take care of several effects that influence the measured pulse height .",
    "first of all , only data from the same tube are compared to exclude systematic errors like dependence on preamplifiers or slightly different gas mixtures .",
    "+ one important quantity is the temperature of the gas .",
    "the pulse height increases with temperature if the pressure is kept constant ( fig.[fig = gainmeas ] ) .",
    "the order of magnitude of this effect is some percent per kelvin .",
    "since the data were taken in a non - air - conditioned hall with temperature variations of up to 5k within one measurement , temperature corrections of the pulse height had to be done .",
    "gas gain measurements at different temperatures have been done with the setup described in @xcite for the gases that were tested in beam measurements .",
    "thus it was possible to apply the correct temperature corrections and to get the diethorn parameters needed for the calculation .",
    "+ however , the most important point is to compare only pulses with equal drift times for the primary electrons .",
    "as can be seen in , the measured pulse height increases with drift time ( with distance from the wire ) .",
    "pulses with a short drift time have a lower maximum and a longer tail compared to those with long drift time  although the primary ionisation is lower due to the shorter track length inside the tube .",
    "therefore , a cut on the drift time was applied to ensure that only pulses with approximately the same drift distance were compared .",
    "+    [ fig = height_tuberad ]    after these cuts , the maximum of each pulse was determined and histogramed .",
    "because the muons are minimum ionising particles , the distribution of the pulse heights follows a landau function @xcite which was fitted to the data .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig = landaufit ] . to describe the distribution of the pulse heights , the most probable pulse height ( which is one parameter of the fit ) was used and not the mean value of the data sample ( which is bigger ) . in the following pulse height",
    "means the most probable pulse height of the landau fit .",
    "[ fig = height_rate ] shows the behaviour of the pulse height with increasing rate for three different settings of the high voltage , corresponding to gas gains of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 at zero rate .",
    "+ the solid lines show a calculation of the pulse height using the diethorn formula ( [ eq : gain ] ) to calculate the gain drop . for the calculation of the electric field ( [ eq : newfield ] ) and the actual gain , several iterations of the calculation of @xmath51v ( [ eq : dv ] ) , the gas gain ( [ eq : gain ] ) and the maximum ion drift time ( [ eq : newt+ ] ) are necessary to obtain an accurate value for the charge density @xmath12 ( [ eq : rho ] ) . to compare measured pulse height and calculated gain , one needs to know the ion mobility which was fitted to @xmath52 and found to be consistent with the value of 1.53@xmath53 for ar@xmath54 in ar from @xcite .",
    "+ one can see that an initially high gas gain drops rather fast with increasing rate , going down to 30% of its initial value at 10khz/@xmath0 . for nominal atlas conditions with a gas gain of 2@xmath55 and photon rates @xmath56100hz/@xmath0 ( corresponding to a muon rate of 200hz/@xmath0 ) the behaviour is rather uncritical , the reduction is some 10% .",
    "+ however , at very high rates , the pulse height is rather independent of the high voltage , the electric field is reduced to the same limiting value .",
    "the order of magnitude of the gain drop with rate is approximately the same for different gases , but the gain drop is larger for gases with low working point ( low high voltage for the same gas gain ) . in that case , the ion drift time is longer and so the space charge density is higher .",
    "+ the same study was done for the 2 cm and 4 cm tubes . because the primary ionisation of a muon is proportional to its path length inside the tube , the signals of a 4 cm tube are higher than those of 3 cm and 2 cm tubes if all are operated at the same gas gain . in order to compare the behaviour of the different tubes , measurements at the same charge per track ( not at the same gas gain ) at zero rate",
    "were compared . for easier comparison , the charge for a 3 cm tube at a gas gain of @xmath57",
    "is set to 1 in fig.[fig = height_tuberad ] .",
    "for the 4 cm tube , no measurement was available for charge=1 , so a calculation is shown ( dashed line ) together with a measurement for lower charge .",
    "one can clearly see that the gain drop is increasing for bigger tubes at the same irradiation .",
    "it is almost negligible for the 2 cm tube , but even for the 4 cm one , the gain drop is in the order of 20% at a muon rate of 1khz/@xmath0 and the nominal gas gain . + the gain reduction could be totally compensated by increasing the high voltage by @xmath51v ( [ eq : dv ] ) corresponding to the actual rate ",
    "assuming that the irradiation is homogeneous along the tube .",
    "the electric field for drifting electrons is changed with rate according to ( [ eq : newfield ] ) . whereas the field changes are more or less the same for different gases at the same rate ( at least if they have to be operated at the same high voltage ) , the effects to the electron drift times are different . the drift time is given by @xmath58 the change in drift time depends on the slope of the drift velocity @xmath59 with the electric field .",
    "a gas becomes faster with rate if the slope is positive and slower if it is negative .",
    "+ one can see here that in order to keep the drift time changes small , one has to look for gases with constant drift velocity , so called linear gases ( linear because in this case , the r - t relation is a straight line ) .",

    "ions were generated at positions according to the results of step one for all previous tracks within the time of the ion drift .",
    "fig [ fig = ioncloud ] gives an example of the distribution of space charges coming from different events .",
    "now , electrons were put at radii r=0.5 mm ...",
    "r=14.5 mm ( or the respective tube radius for the 2 and 4 cm tubes ) and the drift in the ( static ) field resulting of all relevant space charges and the applied voltage was calculated .",
    "the time needed to arrive at the wire was histogramed for each radius",
    ". +    fig .",
    "[ fig = shiftdemo ] ( left ) shows the distribution of these times for radius=14.5 mm .",
    "the right plot shows the position shift resulting from inserting the drift times in the r - t relation ( for rate=0 ) and subtracting the real position where the electron started .",
    "the big , narrow peak belongs to tracks where no charges were inside the tube because the last hit was longer than the ion drift time ago .",
    "the distributions become more and more gaussian for higher rates . + from the histogram of the position shifts ,",
    "two parameters are extracted : the mean value which tells how wrong the r - t relation is for the actual rate and the rms which gives the contribution to resolution decrease .",
    "this number has to be added quadratically to the resolution of the drift tube at zero rate to get the correct value for the resolution at the investigated rate .",
    "+    for comparison with the measurements and the analytical calculation done in the previous section , the mean position shifts for rate=0 ... 1khz/@xmath0 have been calculated ( fig.[fig = shiftsim ] , top ) .",
    "they agree within 5% with the values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig = terr ] ( bottom ) for the gas ar - c@xmath27h@xmath60-n@xmath27-co@xmath27 92 - 3 - 2 - 3% .",
    "[ fig = shiftsim ] bottom shows the corresponding rms values of the position shift histogram .",
    "this is the contribution to the resolution loss coming from fluctuations .",
    "the numbers are non - negligible in the case of high rates and for high precision drift tubes like those of the muon spectrometer for atlas . in that case , the resolution of the tubes is dominated by this effect for a non - linear gas .",
    "+ calculations of drift chamber properties can be done very precisely using the garfield @xcite program .",
    "it also gives reliable numbers for the expected resolution ( at zero rate ) .",
    "it was used to compute the resolution of the gases ar - c@xmath27h@xmath60-n@xmath27-co@xmath27 92 - 3 - 2 - 3% and ar - ch@xmath26-n@xmath27 91 - 5 - 4% with parameters discriminator threshold , noise etc set as expected for atlas conditions .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig = totres ] ( open circles ) . on the contrary to the results shown before ,",
    "the gas gain was doubled to @xmath81 in order to have the same amount of space charges at the same rate as expected for the photons of the atlas background . also the measured data that will be shown below",
    "refer to muon data with a gas gain of @xmath82 .",
    "+ the results of the resolution loss for a rate of 500hz/@xmath0 are shown as squares . the total resolution ( filled circles )",
    "is then given as a quadratical sum of both contributions .",
    "for the first gas , space charges play an important part for radii @xmath28 8 mm , becoming the dominant contribution .",
    "for the second gas , the resolution is not affected by space charges even at very high rates .",
    "the different behaviour of the two gases is in agreement with the expectations : fig.[fig = drift_calc ] already showed that the drift time is nearly uneffected due to space charges for ar - ch@xmath26-n@xmath27 91 - 5 - 4% .",
    "for this linear gas , the drift velocity stays constant with changing electric field - in contrast to the non - linear gas .",
    "+ an experimental proof of these simulations is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig = res129 ] , [ fig = res040 ] .",
    "tracks have been fitted through the chamber and the resolution of a single tube was calculated for different conditions . for the gas ar - c@xmath27h@xmath60-n@xmath27-co@xmath27 92 - 3 - 2 - 3% , one can see in both , measurement and simulation a degradation of the resolution for big radii in the case of high rates .",
    "it is not visible if one takes only low rate data or  as in shown in fig.[fig = res129](bottom )  selects from a high rate run only those events where the previous track was longer than the ion drift time ago and all space charges are gone .",
    "+ the degradation of the resolution is also not visible for a linear gas ( fig.[fig = res040 ] ) where data were taken at the same rate and no cut on the event selection was applied .",
    "+ the measured resolution is slightly worse ( also for low rate ) than the simulation .",
    "this is due to the higher noise and a higher threshold for identification of the pulses needed for our flash adcs .",
    "the simulation shown refers to tdc measurements as foreseen for atlas .",
    "increasing the relevant parameters brings the simulation in accordance with our measurements .",
    "+ finally , the expected resolution of 2 , 3 , and 4 cm tubes shall be compared using a non - linear gas ( for a linear one , the differences are mostly negligible in all cases ) .",
    "the 3 cm results are shown in fig.[fig = totres ] , the others in fig.[fig = totres24 ] .",
    "the 2 cm tube is nearly unaffected by the high irradiation , a resolution loss occurs only in the last 2 mm . on the contrary , for a 4 cm tube",
    "the resolution is dominated by the space charge contribution and the mean spatial resolution becomes much worse than 100@xmath1 m .",
    "gain reduction and changes of drift times have been measured as a function of the rate . for the gases that have been tested ,",
    "a good agreement between measurements and calculation was found .",
    "predictions of the high rate behaviour for new gases can be made without performing measurements . + the gas gain reduction due to space charges is similar for most gases and unavoidable . for a constant rate",
    "it could be compensated by increasing the high voltage .",
    "+ the electric field for drifting electrons is increased because of space charges for radii larger than 4 mm ( in a 3 cm tube ) . for linear gases ( like ar - ch@xmath26-n@xmath27 91 - 5 - 4% )",
    "this may have almost no effect on the r - t relation even at very high rates . for non - linear ones",
    "there are already big effects at rates of 100hz/@xmath0 .",
    "whereas the r - t relation can be adapted for a given irradiation rate , it is ( for practical applications ) impossible to correct for the field fluctuations resulting from the random distribution of the times between two hits .",
    "this gives a contribution to the total resolution of the drift tube which for non - linear gases becomes the dominant limitation of the spatial resolution at large distances from the wire .",
    "we would like to thank our colleagues from the atlas muon collaboration , especially the people from the test beam group for their support and many helpful discussions at any time of the day or night .",
