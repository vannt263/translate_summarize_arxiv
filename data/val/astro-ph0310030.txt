    ", width=336 ]    before i begin the discussion of the standard solar model , i want to begin by paying tribute to two of the great scientists and pioneers of neutrino astrophysics , ray davis ( figure  [ fig : ray ] ) and bruno pontecorvo ( figure  [ fig : pontecorvo ] ) .",
    "bruno first suggested using chlorine as a detector of neutrinos in a chalk river report written in 1946 .",
    "ray followed up on bruno s suggestion and the careful unpublished feasibility study of louie alvarez . using with care and skill a chlorine detector and reactor neutrinos , ray showed in 1955 - 1958 that @xmath4 and @xmath5 were different .",
    "about a decade later , ray first detected solar neutrinos , laying the foundation for the studies that are so widely discussed today .",
    "bruno recognized that solar neutrinos could potentially tell us something about particle physicists and he laid the foundation for the modern theory of neutrino oscillations .",
    ", width=288 ]    the solar neutrino saga has been a community effort in which thousands of chemists , physicists , astronomers , and engineers have contributed in crucial ways to refining the nuclear physics , the astrophysics , and the detectors so that the subject could become a precision test of stellar evolution and , ultimately , of weak interaction theory .",
    "but , these two wonderful scientists and wonderful human beings started us on a marvelous road of discovery .",
    "ray s role in the subject , like bruno s , has been unique .",
    "any historical summary , even of solar models , would be grossly incomplete if it did not emphasize the inspiration provided by ray s experimental vision . although ray never was involved in solar model calculations , and has always maintained a healthy skepticism regarding their validity , his interest in performing a solar neutrino experiment was the motivation for my entering and remaining in the subject .",
    "more importantly , for all of the formative years of the  solar neutrino problem \" , ray inspired everyone who became involved with solar neutrinos by his conviction that valid and fundamental measurements could be made using solar neutrinos .",
    "we committed to a subject that did not attract main stream scientists because we believed in ray s dream of measuring the solar neutrino flux .    in 1967 , one year before the first results of ray s chlorine solar neutrino experiment were announced , bruno published a prophetic paper entitled : ` neutrino experiments and the problem of conservation of leptonic charge ' [ zh .",
    "53 , 1717 ( 1967 ) ] . in this paper ,",
    "bruno suggested many different experiments that could test whether leptonic charge was conserved .",
    "the grandchildren of these experiments are being discussed this summer by particle physicists at conferences held all over the world .",
    "bruno included a short section in his paper that he called ` oscillations and astronomy . ' in this section , bruno wrote : `` from the point of view of detection possibilities , an ideal object is the sun , '' what a wonderfully contemporary statement !",
    "bruno , like most particle physicists of the 1960 s , the 1970 s , the 1980 s , and even the 1990 s , did not believe astrophysical calculations could be reliable .",
    "he wrote in this same section on oscillations and astronomy : `` unfortunately , the weight of the various thermonuclear reactions in the sun , and the central temperature of the sun are insufficiently well known in order to allow a useful comparison of expected and observed solar neutrinos , from the point of view of this article . ''",
    "[ this was 30 years before the precise confirmation of the standard solar model by helioseismology . ] to support his claim , bruno referenced only his 1946 chalk river report , which mentioned the sun in just two sentences .",
    "bruno did cite our detailed calculations of the solar neutrino fluxes elsewhere in his 1967 paper , but they seem not to have affected his thinking",
    ".    ray and i have written three articles on the history of solar neutrino research ( in 1976 , 1982 , and 2000 , see http://www.sns.ias.edu/  jnb under the menu item solar neutrinos / history ) .",
    "it is not feasible to present in a short talk a balanced account of all the material covered in these three articles with the appropriate acknowledgments of the important work of so many people .",
    "therefore , i shall just describe some of the highlights regarding the standard solar model from a very personal view .",
    "i encourage the listeners who are interested in a more balanced presentation to look back at the earlier articles which provide references to critical work done by a large number of researchers .",
    "i describe the development of the  standard solar model \" for neutrino predictions in five subsections , covering the period 1962 - 1988 ( section  3.1 ) , 1988 - 1995 ( section  3.2 ) , 1995 - 1997 ( section  3.3 ) , 1998 - 2002 ( section  3.4 ) , and 2002 - 2003 ( section  3.5 ) .      at the time ray and i first began discussing the possibility of a solar neutrino experiment , in 1962 , there were no solar model calculations of solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "ray , who heard about some of my work on weak interactions from willy fowler , wrote and asked if i could calculate the rate of the @xmath3be electron capture reaction in the sun .",
    "after i did the calculation and submitted the paper to physical review , i woke up to the obvious fact that we needed a detailed model of the sun ( the temperature , density , and composition profiles ) in order to convert the result to a flux that ray might consider measuring .",
    "i moved to willy s laboratory at caltech , where there were experts in stellar modeling who were working on stellar evolution .",
    "we used the codes of dick sears and icko iben , and a bit of nuclear fusion input that i provided , to calculate the first solar model prediction of solar neutrinos in @xmath6 .",
    "the result was extremely disappointing to ray and to me , since the event rate from neutrino capture by chlorine that i calculated from our first flux evaluation was too small by an order of magnitude to be measured in any chlorine detector that ray thought would be feasible .",
    "the situation was reversed in late 1963 , when i realized that the capture rate for @xmath7b neutrinos on chlorine would be increased by almost a factor of @xmath8 over my earlier calculations because of transitions to the excited states of argon , most importantly the super - allowed transition from the ground state of @xmath9cl to the isotopic analogue state at about @xmath10 mev excitation energy in @xmath9ar .",
    "this increase in the predicted rate made the experiment appear feasible and ray and i wrote a joint paper for physical review letters proposing a practical chlorine experiment , a paper that was separated into two shorter papers to meet the space requirements .    during the period @xmath11 ,",
    "the input data to the solar models were refined in a number of important ways as the result of the hard work of many people .",
    "the most significant changes were in the measured laboratory rate for the @xmath1he-@xmath1he reaction ( changed by a factor of 3.9 ) , in the theoretically calculated rate for the @xmath12 reaction ( changed by @xmath13% ) , and the observed value of the heavy element to hydrogen ratio , @xmath14 ( decreased by a factor of @xmath15 ) .",
    "unfortunately , each of the individual corrections were in a direction that decreased the predicted flux .",
    "ray s first measurement was reported in prl in 1968 .",
    "our accompanying best - estimate solar model prediction ( made together with n. a. bahcall and g. shaviv ) was about a factor of 2.5 times larger than ray s upper limit .",
    "but the uncertainties in the model predictions were , in 1968 , sufficiently large that i personally did not feel confident in concluding that the disagreement between prediction and measurement meant that something fundamental was really wrong .",
    "as it turned out , the values of the stellar interior parameters used in @xmath16 are in reasonably good agreement with the values used today . however , the uncertainties are much better known now , after more than three decades of intense and precise studies and refinements by many different groups working all over the world .",
    "the laboratory measurement of the @xmath3be(@xmath17)@xmath7b cross section was a principal source of uncertainty in the @xmath18 prediction , remained a principal uncertainty in @xmath16 , and is still today one of the two largest uncertainties in the solar neutrino predictions .",
    "the best - estimate measured value for the cross section has decreased significantly since 1968 ( see figure  [ fig : be7pcrosssection ] ) .    as we shall see in the subsequent discussion , the only fundamentally new element that has been introduced in the theoretical calculations since @xmath16 is the effect of element diffusion in the sun ( see 1988 - 1997 below ) .    during the period @xmath19",
    ", very few people worked on topics related to solar neutrinos .",
    "there was only one solar neutrino detector , ray s chlorine experiment .",
    "his measurement was lower than our prediction .",
    "i concentrated during these two long decades on refining the predictions and , most importantly , making the estimates of the uncertainties more formal and more robust .",
    "we calculated the uncertainties by computing the partial derivatives of each of the fluxes with respect to each of the significant input parameters . in 1988 , roger ulrich and i also did a monte carlo study of the uncertainties , which made use of the fluxes calculated from @xmath20 standard solar models . for each of the @xmath20 models ,",
    "the value of each input parameter was drawn from a probability distribution that had the same mean and variance as was assigned to that parameter .",
    "the monte carlo results confirmed the conclusions reached using the partial derivatives .",
    "the uncertainty estimates made during this period are the basis for the uncertainties assigned in the current neutrino flux predictions and influence inferences regarding neutrino parameters ( like @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) that are derived from analyses that make use of the solar model predictions .      in the period @xmath23 , f. rogers and j. iglesias of the livermore national laboratory",
    "published their detailed and improved calculations of stellar radiative opacities and equation of state .",
    "now almost universally used by stellar modelers , this fundamental work resolved a number of long standing discrepancies between observations and predictions of stellar models .    in the same @xmath24 rmp paper in which we presented the monte carlo study of the uncertainties , roger ulrich and i also made comparisons between the predictions of our standard solar model  constructed to predict solar neutrinos  and",
    "the then existing helioseismological data on @xmath25-mode oscillations .",
    "the agreement was reasonably impressive : the model predictions and the measured frequency splittings agreed to about @xmath26% .",
    "but , we suspected that there was something missing in the solar models .    during the period @xmath27",
    ", my colleagues and i made successively better approximations at including element diffusion in the solar model calculations .",
    "first , we derived an approximate analytic description which was included in the solar models ( after some significant coding struggles ) and later we made use of a precise computer subroutine that calculated the diffusion numerically .",
    "this work was done with s. basu , a. loeb , m. pinsonneault , and a. thoule .      in @xmath28 , steve tomczyk and his colleagues presented the first observations of the solar @xmath25-mode oscillations that included modes that sampled well both the intermediate solar interior and the deep interior .",
    "these observations determined precise observational values for the sound speed over essentially the entire solar interior .",
    "we were in a wonderful position to make use of these precise sound speeds . in @xmath28 , marc pinsonneault and i",
    "had just published a systematic study of improved solar models that incorporated the new opacity and equation of state calculations from the livermore group and , most importantly , we had succeeded in including helium and heavy element diffusion in our standard solar model .",
    "together with sarbani basu and joergen christensen - dalsgaard , we showed that the helioseismologically measured sound speeds were in excellent agreement throughout the sun with the values calculated from our previously constructed standard solar model .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : soundspeeds ] , the agreement averaged better than @xmath29% r.m.s . in the solar interior .",
    "we made a simple scaling argument between accuracy in predicting sound speeds and accuracy in predicting neutrino fluxes .",
    "the concluding sentence in the abstract of our prl paper was :     standard solar models predict the structure of the sun more accurately than is required for applications involving solar neutrinos . \"    ,",
    "width=336 ]    this result was published in the january 1997 issue of prl , but i had earlier presented at neutrino 96 in helsinki ( june 1996 ) the same conclusion based upon somewhat less precise helioseismological data . since some of you were present also at helsinki , you may be interested in the precise form of the statement made in the printed proceedings :     helioseismology , as summarized in figure 2 [ a comparison of measured and calculated sound speeds ] , has effectively shown that the solar neutrino problems can not be ascribed to errors in the temperature profile of the sun . \"    the helioseismological confirmation of the standard solar model changed for me personally the way that i regarded ` the solar neutrino problem . '",
    "i no longer felt it was necessary to soften the claim that the origin of the ` problem ' was new physics not bad astronomy .",
    "so , from the astronomical perspective , we have known for six years that new physics was required to resolve the discrepancy between the standard predictions of the solar model and electroweak theory . even prior to the existence of this helioseismological evidence ,",
    "it had become clear that one could not fit the data for all the solar neutrino experiments by simply re - scaling standard predictions of neutrino fluxes .",
    "why did it take so long ?",
    "in section  5 , i will try to answer the question : why were some physicists unconvinced by the astronomical evidence that solar neutrino oscillations occurred ?",

    "particle physicists , and most other physicists too , were skeptical of what astronomers and astrophysicists could learn about an environment that they could neither visit nor manipulate .",
    "these physicists often had only a newspaper - level understanding of the observational phenomena that stellar models reproduced and the constraints they met .",
    "second , physicists who heard talks on solar neutrinos , were most impressed by the fact that the @xmath7b solar neutrino flux depended on the 25th power of the central temperature , @xmath57 .",
    "this dependence seemed to many physicists too sensitive to allow an accurate prediction ( an objection which was answered experimentally only by the helioseismological measurements in 1995 and their successful comparison in 1996 - 1997 with standard solar model predictions , see section  3.3 . )",
    "third , the simplest interpretation of the discrepancy between observed and predicted solar neutrino event rates , vacuum neutrino oscillations ( proposed by bruno pontecorvo ) , suggested large mixing angles for the neutrinos .",
    "it was widely ( but not universally ) agreed among particle theorists that mixing angles in the lepton sector would be small in analogy with the mixing angles in the quark sector .",
    "the most popular view of particle theorists over most of the history of solar neutrino research has been that since quarks and leptons are probably in the same multiplets , they should have mixing angles of comparable size .",
    "this objection to new solar neutrino physics was removed only when mikheyev and smirnov built upon the earlier work of wolfenstein to describe the magic of the msw effect .",
    "ironically , the small mixing angle ( sma ) msw solution persuaded a significant number of physicists that there might be new physics being revealed by solar neutrino experiments , although today we know that only large mixing angles solutions are good fits to all the available solar and reactor neutrino data .",
    "i think that the spirit with which many particle physicists regarded solar neutrino research is best expressed by a quotation from the introduction of a 1990 paper written by h. georgi and m. luke [ nucl .",
    "b , 347 , 1 ( 1990 ) ] .",
    "they began their article as follows :     most likely , the solar neutrino problem has nothing to do with particle physics .",
