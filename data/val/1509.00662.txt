    "the discovery of new extrasolar planetary systems is today routinely carried out with a wealth of space - based and ground - based observational facilities , and our knowledge frontier has already moved on from their mere search to the determination of stellar and planetary properties which are relevant to understand the evolution of these bodies during stellar lifetime . in particular , one of the open issues is the extent of magnetic star ",
    "planet interaction ( spi ) and its detectable effects in systems with close - in massive planets ( so called `` hot jupiters '' ) .",
    "this phenomenon is astrophysically important for the characterization of planetary magnetospheres , and as a mechanism of energy and angular momentum transfer between the host star and its planet(s ) @xcite .",
    "observations of variable chromospheric emission signatures , such as the ca ii h&k lines cores , were reported for a few stars , with a modulation period close to the orbital period of the planet @xcite , and interpreted as evidence of spi of magnetic origin .",
    "in fact , a tidally induced effect can be excluded because  for low - eccentricity orbits ",
    "the periodic modulation is expected twice per orbital period , due to the two tidal bulges on the opposite sides of the stellar surface .",
    "conversely , a purely stellar activity effect is unlikely because the relevant time scale should be the stellar rotation period rather than the planetary orbital period .",
    "however , significant chromospheric variability is visible only at some epochs , and the existence of detectable spi signatures at x - ray wavelengths is a matter of debate .",
    "@xcite showed that stars with hot jupiters are statistically brighter in x - rays than stars without hot jupiters , and @xcite claimed a correlation between the x - ray luminosity of the host star and the planetary mass which he ascribed to the same phenomenon .",
    "detailed statistical studies by @xcite and @xcite , reached instead the conclusion that the above results can be affected by observational biases , and that spi induces quite small effects in most cases , which become important and measurable only in peculiar systems .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite pinpointed the case of two wide binaries where the planet - hosting primary component is much brighter in x - rays than expected by considering the activity level of the coeval companion .",
    "this finding suggests that spi , by acting through transfer of angular momentum from the planet to the star and increasing thus the stellar rotation and activity , may lead to enhanced x - ray emission and thus `` rejuvenating '' the star .",
    "detailed studies of individual systems were also performed , leading to different results : the occurrence of repeated flaring events in hd189733a just after egress from planet occultation , observed with _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite , suggests a systematic spi that leads to x - ray and fuv variability phased with the planetary motion ; instead , a long _ xmm - newton_monitoring program of hd179949 @xcite , showed evidence of chromospheric and coronal variability most likely due to stellar rotation and to intrinsic short - term activity evolution , but no clear signature related to the orbital motion of the planet .",

    "* ) , with an expected dependence on the relative velocity between the coronal and planetary magnetic fields .",
    "another key parameter is given by the relative strength of planetary and stellar magnetic fields , which determines the level of intersection of the respective alfvnic surfaces , as investigated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "sophisticated mhd simulations by @xcite confirm that the interaction of stellar and planetary magnetospheres lead to magnetic stresses that may result in reconnection and reconfiguration events where energy is eventually dissipated by high - energy radiation .    as a possible test of this scenario we focused our attention on , a system with a jupiter - mass planet in an eccentric orbit .",
    "in fact , spi is expected to have a strong dependence on the star ",
    "planet separation @xcite , and in systems with elongated orbits it must occur preferentially or exclusively in proximity of periastron , when the stellar and planetary magnetospheres are close enough to interact .",
    "the system is composed by a g0 primary ( @xmath18 ) at 75pc from the sun and a transiting planet ( @xmath19 ) on a 21.2 days period orbit with eccentricity @xmath20 , and periastron and apoastron distances of 7.4 r@xmath21 and 39.1 r@xmath21 , respectively ( semimajor axis @xmath22au , * ? ? ?",
    "the host star is characterized by a chromospheric activity index @xmath23 ranging from @xmath24 to @xmath25 @xcite , typical of middle - aged solar - type stars .",
    "we observed hd17156  with the epic camera on board _ xmm - newton _  in two visits of @xmath26ks each , on september 5 and september 20 2014 .",
    "the aim was to observe the star with the planet at the periastron passage and far from periastron in order to seek phase - related x - ray variability which could be ascribed to spi .",
    "the observation data files ( odf ) were reduced with sas ver .",
    "13.5 and the latest set of calibration files ( ccf ) . for each exposure , we obtained tables of the events calibrated in detector positions , arrival time , energy , event _ pattern _ and quality flag .",
    "we filtered the events for the recommended flags and patterns ( flag=0 , pattern @xmath27 ) , with energies in the broad band 0.38.0kev , and in a soft band 0.31.5kev .",
    "since a soft spectrum is expected for low - activity stars like hd17156 , we preferred the soft band for source detection in the epic images , as already experimented with the observations of hd189733 , having the bulk of x - ray emission below 1.5 kev @xcite .    for the detection of the star and for estimating significance and rate , or upper limits , we used a code based on a multi - scale wavelet convolution @xcite .",
    "hd17156  was also observed with the harps - n spectrograph @xcite at the italian 3.6 m telescopio nazionale galileo . in this paper",
    "we present data acquired between 2014 august and december , in preparation and as a follow - up of the _ xmm - newton _  program .",
    "the full observation log is shown in tab.[tab : obslog ] .",
    "note in particular two harps - n observations coordinated with _ xmm - newton _ , on 2014 september 9 and 21 , the latter effectively simultaneous with _ xmm - newton _  while the planet was at periastron .",
    "optical spectra were acquired with different exposure times , for different aims : short exposures ( 15 minutes each ) belong to a long - term series aimed to precise radial velocity measurements , while long exposures ( 120 or 180 minutes ) were optimized for high - resolution spectroscopy of the ca ii h&k 3968.5 , 3933.7  chromospheric emission lines . in order to avoid saturation at longer wavelengths ,",
    "the long exposures were always split in a number of 15 minutes sub - exposures , and the raw images were combined a posteriori to compute an average spectrum using the standard harps - n pipeline . in this respect , we have followed the same observation strategy and data reduction and analysis detailed in @xcite .",
    "these data were employed to update the orbital parameters .",
    "adopting the transit timing reported in @xcite , we obtained the following ephemeris ( @xmath28 ) for the passage at periastron : @xmath29 the orbital phases at the start of each observation are reported in tab.[tab : obslog ] .",
    "in fig . [ ximag ] we show the field of view around hd17156  in the two _ xmm - newton_exposures . the brightest source visible in both images",
    "is an unidentified background source , at @xmath30 from the optical position of our target .",
    "hd17156  was not detected while the planet was approaching the apoastron ( september 5 ) , at a level of @xmath31 of the local background , while it was detected in the visibility window that started 9 hr after periastron ( september 20 ) and lasted for about 10 hr . employing the pn and mos  2 data",
    ", we obtained a @xmath32 significance level in the soft band , with a pn - equivalent count rate of @xmath33cts s@xmath34 using a maximum wavelet spatial scale of @xmath35 .",
    "about @xmath36 photons were collected in total in the two epic detectors , and their time distribution is compatible with a constant source ( kolmogorov  smirnov test probability @xmath37% ) .",
    "the evaluation of the target x - ray flux is hampered by the presence of the contaminating background source , detected in the first observation with a count rate @xmath38% higher than in the second observation . however ,",
    "this source is quite hard and highly absorbed : in fact , its spectrum can be described as a thermal source with @xmath39kev attenuated by a hydrogen column density @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "hence , we employed only the events collected with the pn detector in the soft band ( 0.3 - 1.5 kev ) already used for the source detection process . taking into account the encircled energy fraction for a point source within a @xmath35 radius , we obtain a count rate of @xmath42 cts / s for hd17156 .",
    "we estimated the source x - ray flux assuming optically thin emission from a thermal plasma with solar composition and @xmath43mk , as appropriate for a solar - type corona , thus obtaining @xmath44 erg @xmath41 s@xmath45 . a similar procedure yielded an upper limit @xmath46 erg @xmath41 s@xmath45for the source emission far from the periastron .    in order to evaluate the intrinsic source x - ray luminosity , we estimated the interstellar absorption starting from the stellar effective temperature @xmath47k @xcite , which implies an unreddened color @xmath48 @xcite , and a color excess @xmath49 , yielding an optical extinction @xmath50 , and hence @xmath51 @xmath41@xcite . from this value of absorption and the thermal emission model assumed above",
    ", we obtain an unabsorbed flux of @xmath52 erg @xmath41 s@xmath45 , and a corresponding x - ray luminosity of @xmath53 erg s@xmath45  close to periastron .",
    "similarly , far from periastron the upper limit is @xmath54 erg s@xmath45 .",
    "we note however that these estimates are very sensitive to the assumed plasma temperature .",
    "for example , a 1 mk plasma would imply x - ray luminosities 6 times larger than reported above .",

    "symbol sizes indicate different exposure lengths . in red the harps - n observations coordinated with _",
    "xmm - newton _ , and the baseline obtained with an error - weighted regression , excluding only the data point which corresponds to the x - ray detection of the target . ]      the mount wilson @xmath1 index was computed by the harps - n pipeline following the recipe of @xcite .",
    "we recall that this is a measure of the chromospheric emission in the ca ii h&k lines , corrected for a basal level depending on the stellar @xmath55 color , and normalized to the stellar bolometric luminosity . in fig .",
    "[ fig : caii ] we show the variation of @xmath23 vs.  time , from 2014 august to december , and vs.  orbital phase . in the 5 months",
    "considered , the data suggest a chromospheric activity level essentially flat within the uncertainties of the measures .",
    "most remarkable is the significantly higher ( @xmath56 ) value of @xmath1 measured simultaneously with the x - ray detection of our target .",
    "in fact , we observed a 4% increase of the chromospheric emission at phase 0.03 ( just after periastron ) with respect to the previous measurement taken at phase 0.46 ( approaching apoastron ) .",
    "high @xmath1 values apparently occurred also on other dates in 2014 august , but these measurements are affected by relatively large uncertainties because they were derived from observations with short exposures .",
    "some low - level variability could also be due to residual systematics in the reduction of the harps - n data @xcite .",
    "hd17156  showed enhanced chromospheric and coronal emission a few hours after the passage of the planet at the periastron .",
    "both the x - ray luminosity and the @xmath1 index indicate a star with a magnetic activity level lower than expected .",
    "in fact , modeling of the rossiter ",
    "mclaughlin effect yields a rotational velocity of @xmath57 km s@xmath34 @xcite , and the computed rotation period @xmath58days leads to a presumed x - ray luminosity @xmath59@xmath60erg s@xmath45 , adopting the activity  rotation relations by @xcite .",
    "starting from a stellar age of @xmath61gyr , based on transit and asteroseismic observations by @xcite , we also derive @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the range @xmath64 $ ] from the activity  age relations by @xcite .",
    "our observed chromospheric and coronal emission levels are , respectively , a factor @xmath65 and @xmath66 lower than the values above . on the other hand",
    ", the measured chromospheric index indicates an x - ray luminosity 12@xmath67erg s@xmath45 , in agreement with the _ xmm - newton_observations .",
    "we conclude that hd17156  was in a low - activity state , with a `` quiescent '' x - ray luminosity just below the detection sensitivity of the sept 5 _ xmm - newton_observation .",
    "consequently , in the following we assume an average large - scale magnetic field strength of just 1 g @xcite , and an energy release @xmath68erg s@xmath45due to an spi event at the periastron .",
    "we deem unlikely the occurrence of a spontaneous flaring event of such power ( @xmath69 quiescent @xmath70 ) in the corona of a quiet star , such as hd17156 , just after reaching the minimum star  planet separation .",
    "one hypothesis is that the spi phenomenon has a magnetic origin .",
    "we evaluated the energy budget with the magnetic spi models by @xcite .",
    "we assume a loop interconnecting the stellar magnetic field with a planetary field of @xmath66  g ( based on analogy with our jupiter and theoretical models , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for magnetic confinement , the plasma temperature near the planet position should not exceed 0.7  mk .",
    "in this case , the maximum available power due to magnetic stresses near periastron is @xmath71 erg s@xmath45 , for a stellar potential dipolar configuration .",
    "we do not expect any energy release by this mechanism at apoastron .",
    "a possible difficulty with this explanation rests on the mhd time scales for establishing an interconnecting loop , building up the magnetic stresses and releasing the accumulated energy , given the fast planetary passage .",
    "in fact , the relative velocity of the magnetic field co - rotating with the star with respect to the planet speed at periastron is about 160 km s@xmath45 , implying a dynamical time scale of 1015 hr .",
    "stability of such a long loop ( @xmath72 cm ) is also an open issue .",
    "reconnection between separate stellar and planetary magnetospheres is also unlikely , because the dissipated power would be lower than estimated above by about four orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the power emitted in x - rays is released by matter evaporated from the planet and accreted onto the star near periastron @xcite .",
    "this requires a mass accretion rate larger than @xmath73 g s@xmath45 to make a power of @xmath74erg s@xmath45 available .",
    "the free - fall time from the inner lagrangian point l1 to the star is about 14 hr , making this process compatible with the delay of the brightening we observed after periastron . on the other hand",
    ", detailed simulations are required to understand the mechanism and time scale of accumulation and spill over of evaporated material onto the star .",
    "in any case , inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : caii ] shows that no significant chromospheric brightening was observed near other periastron passages , preceding or following the one highlighted by the x - ray detection .",
    "we conclude that spi events in this high - eccentricity system occur occasionally , or they have a short time duration .",
    "monitoring of hd17156  will be continued in the frame of the gaps programme with the aim to better understand the frequency of the putative spi effects and their nature .",
