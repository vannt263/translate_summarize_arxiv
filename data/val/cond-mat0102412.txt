    "the old problem of surmounting a potential barrier , known as kramers problem , is doubtlessly relevant in connection with many topics , in fields ranging from physics to finance .",
    "it is a key ingredient to understanding phase - transitions in complex systems , both in and far - from thermal equilibrium . in particular",
    ", the quantity known as the escape time ( or mean first passage time ) from one stable state to another has found numerous applications in a variety of interesting and novel problems .",
    "for example , it plays a key role in stochastic resonance @xcite , in describing fluctuation - induced transport such as occurs in kink motion @xcite and ratchets @xcite .",
    "even the extent of chaos in hamiltonian systems has been shown to have connections with this quantity @xcite .",
    "a nice collection of these and other stochastically driven processes can be found in ref @xcite .",
    "however , all of the above examples have been formulated within a standard brownian framework , for which diffusion properties are normal . in this paper",
    "we look at the problem of calculating the escape time for systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion of the correlated type ( in contrast to levy type diffusion , which we do not discuss here ) .",
    "an understanding of escape time properties in such systems could open the door for understanding new stochastically driven phenomena . to our knowledge",
    "there has yet been little work done along these lines , although we are aware of some studies relating the anomalous transport properties on a random comb to the distribution of mean first passage times @xcite .",
    "the systems we are interested in are such that the diffusion is dependent on the density of particles @xmath4 , resulting in a diffusion coefficient which is proportional to a power ( @xmath5 ) of @xmath4 .",
    "many physical systems are well - described by this class of processes .",
    "let us mention , amongst other examples , percolation of gases through porous media ( @xmath6)@xcite , thin saturated regions in porous media ( @xmath7 ) @xcite , gravitational spreading of thin liquid films ( @xmath8 ) @xcite , heat transfer by marshak waves ( @xmath9 ) @xcite , surface growth ( @xmath10 ) @xcite , spatial diffusion of biological populations ( @xmath6)@xcite , plasma flows ( @xmath11)@xcite . explicitly , these processes are ruled by an equation of the type known in the literature as _ porous media equation_@xcite    @xmath12^\\nu,\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is a dimensionless coordinate representing a bond - length , angle or any other chemical or physical state variable , @xmath14 is the dimensionless time and @xmath15 .",
    "rewritting the nonlinear term as @xmath16 , it becomes evident that the restriction @xmath17 guarantees that the flux will be from more dense to less dense regions .",
    "since the non - linearity in @xmath4 is known to lead to anomalous diffusion if @xmath3 ( namely superdiffusion for @xmath11 and subdiffusion for @xmath18@xcite , as @xmath19 ) important anomalies are also expected when crossing over a barrier is involved .",
    "precisely , we want to unveil here how escape properties are altered when @xmath3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the systems of interest and discuss some of their general features .",
    "because fluctuations are determined by @xmath20 for @xmath3 , the escape behavior will depend on the initial condition @xmath21 .",
    "therefore we first consider systems in the vicinity of the steady state , a condition which allows analytical treatment .",
    "numerical and analytical results for this case are presented in secs .",
    "iii and iv , respectively . in sec .",
    "v we study numerically the escape behavior of systems far from the steady state , comparing the results with the previous ones . finally , section vi contains concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider a set of identical particles immersed into a thermal environment such as that described by the porous media equation ( [ pme ] ) . under the influence of an external bistable potential @xmath1 , introduced in order to probe the escape behavior",
    ", the density of particles evolves following the nonlinear fokker - planck ( fp ) equation :    @xmath22\\,+\\ , d\\partial^2_x[\\rho(x , t)]^\\nu.\\ ] ]    this class of equations has been the object of diverse previous studies@xcite .",
    "the stationary solution of eq .  ( [ fp ] ) is @xmath23_+^{\\frac{1}{\\nu-1}}/z,\\ ] ] where @xmath24_+=max\\{f,0\\}$ ] , @xmath25 is a ( positive ) normalization constant , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the absolute minimum of the potential . in the limit @xmath29",
    "the standard linear fokker - planck equation is obtained .",
    "in such a case , the steady state characterized by the boltzmann - gibbs distribution @xmath30 , is recovered . however , for @xmath3 , the stationary solutions of eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) have the form of the maximum tsallis entropy probability distributions , as already discussed previously @xcite , even in the absence of external drift @xcite .",
    "it is worth recalling that phemonena such as full developed turbulence @xcite , the hadronic transverse moment distribution in high energy scattering process @xmath31 @xcite , among others , have been satisfactorily described in terms of distributions similar to ( [ ss ] ) instead of the canonical stationary one .",
    "steady state solutions are illustrated in fig . 1 for a quartic potential .",
    "note that a cut - off condition ( tsallis cut - off ) , yielding regions with null probability , arises in the @xmath18 case ( see fig .",
    "for a quartic potential the condition @xmath32 must hold so that the solutions can be normalized .",
    "however , the free - particle case requires @xmath33 so we restrict our discussion to this regime .",
    "the nonlinearity in the diffusion term of eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) accounts for the fact that the environment presents some kind of disorder or long range correlations in space - time leading to diffusion anomalies .",
    "the expression @xmath26 can be interpreted as a generalized einstein relation for this scenario .",
    "note that in disordered or correlated systems such as those discussed here , the standard einstein relation is expected to be recovered _ in the absence of disorder _",
    "this corresponds to the case of @xmath34 yielding the well - known result @xmath35 .",
    "also , as was shown in @xcite , the time - dependent form of these einstein relations can be used to demonstrate the anomalous scaling properties of these nonlinear diffusion systems . for the free particle one",
    "obtains @xmath36 .",
    "the ito - langevin ( il ) counterpart of eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) reads@xcite    @xmath37^\\frac{\\nu-1}{2}\\eta(t),\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 is a delta correlated gaussian noise with zero mean and variance 2 . in the particular case @xmath39 , the standard langevin equation for constant noise is recovered .",
    "it is noteworthy that this is a phenomenological description , in which the microscopic trajectories are determined by the macroscopic quantity @xmath4 when @xmath3 .",
    "physically , this represents a kind of statistical feedback . as with state - dependent noise ,",
    "it is to be seen as the influence of the environment , which is otherwise not explicitly taken into account by the equations of motion .",
    "as a particle evolves , it interacts with the environment such that it reacts to the collective density of states around it .",
    "we can think of the subdiffusive case as a kind of `` attraction '' to the other particles : particles tend to stay close to the other particles , fluctuating not far from them .",
    "conversely , we can think of super - diffusive cases as a kind of reaction to the sparseness : if the particle is in a highly populated region then it is in a sense confined by the other particles , and fluctuations are not so large , but as soon as it gets into less dense regions it does not experience this confinement and fluctuations can get very large .",
    "for numerical experiments we chose as prototype of double - well potential the quartic polynomial @xmath40 .",
    "the coefficients were chosen as in fig .  1 , for which @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 corresponding to the bottom of the left - hand well , the top of the barrier and the bottom of the right - hand well , respectively .",
    "we studied the escape behavior close to the steady state .",
    "that is , once a population of a large number of particles has already attained the steady state described by eq .",
    "( [ ss ] ) , a probe was injected at @xmath42 .",
    "then its trajectory was obtained by solving , following the numerical scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite , the il ( [ il ] ) for @xmath45 , starting from @xmath46 .",
    "typical trajectories are displayed in fig .",
    "2 . for @xmath18",
    ", fluctuations are reduced and trajectories result confined to the region within the cut - off boundaries ( see also fig .",
    "1b ) ; moreover , when the diffusion constant @xmath47 is smaller than a critical value @xmath48 ( here @xmath49 for @xmath50 ) , the state space becomes disconnected and crossings become forbidden . for @xmath11 , the amplitude of noise is enhanced in the regions of low density and the entire space tends to be populated .",
    "we measured the mean first passage time , i.e. , the average time interval @xmath51 that a particle at @xmath42 takes to reach for the first time a given state @xmath52 . in fig .",
    "3 we present plots of @xmath53 vs. @xmath13 . for @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "3a ) , plateaux become evident as @xmath47 approaches @xmath48 indicating that most of the time is spent overcoming the barrier around @xmath43 . on the other hand , for @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "3b ) , the passage time is sensitive to the exact final state and there is not a well defined plateau , even in the small-@xmath47 regime .",
    "moreover , as @xmath47 decreases , the curves collapse to a limiting one for states below @xmath44 , but grow faster above @xmath44 , diverging in the limit @xmath55 .",
    "the escape behavior seems to be discontinuous at @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath56 there is no diffusion , however , for finite @xmath47 the particle is attracted towards the deepest valley at @xmath44 and becomes trapped within a typical time interval which is bounded from above .",
    "this effect can be understood having in mind that fluctuations depend on @xmath47 not only through the factor @xmath57 but also by means of the density through a factor that , for @xmath11 , becomes very large outside the neighborhood of the absolute minimum where particles tend to concentrate as @xmath55 . in other words ,",
    "the deterministic case is not recovered when @xmath55 since the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath58 does not vanish in that limit due to the singularity at @xmath59 .",
    "let us show that these results can be understood analytically . for a system in the vicinity of the steady state , we can consider the following approximation for eq .",
    "( [ fp ] )    @xmath60\\,+\\ , d\\partial^2_x[\\{\\rho_s(x)\\}^{\\nu-1}\\rho(x , t)].\\ ] ]    once the fp equation is linear , the problem of escape from a well can be treated directly , following the same lines as for homogeneous processes characterized by time independent drift and diffusion coefficients @xcite .",
    "basically an equation for the probability that the particle is still within a given interval of state space at time @xmath14 is found using the corresponding backward fokker - planck equation and solved under appropriate boundary conditions . in this way",

    "the escape time follows the power law @xmath76 .    if @xmath77 and @xmath78 , then , it is possible to find an approximate expression for the escape time @xmath70 when @xmath73 ( hence @xmath79 ) is sufficiently small , noting that the integrands in eq .",

( [ taprox ] ) indicates that @xmath70 diverges for vanishing @xmath73 . in particular , if @xmath71 , @xmath88 and the deterministic limit is achieved . in the limit",
    "@xmath29 the exponential growth of @xmath70 with @xmath69 is always recovered .",
    "the problem in the vicinity of the steady state actually corresponds to a linear one with a state dependent diffusion coefficient .",
    "however , it allows an analytical treatment which can be had in mind as a reference when studying more general cases . in order to test how the previous results compare to those of a more general situation",
    ", we also performed numerical studies of the escape properties far from the steady state .",
    "particularly , we studied the case where particles are injected all at the same time at @xmath42 .",
    "this instance requires simultaneous integration of the fp equation , in order to follow the evolution of @xmath20 starting from @xmath89 , together with integration of the il equation ( [ il ] ) , starting from @xmath90 .",
    "now , the parameter @xmath74 must lie in the region @xmath65 due to the divergence in eq .",

    "( [ tnu ] ) fits well to the numerical results for any @xmath65 , following the power law @xmath91 derived above .",
    "on the other hand , for small @xmath47 , crossing times become closer to those of the standard case @xmath39 for any @xmath74 .",
    "this can be understood as follows . for @xmath18 ,",
    "passage times are smaller than those given by eq .",
    "( [ tnu ] ) since , as the distribution evolves , there is an initial passage even between regions disconnected at the steady state ( see fig .",
    "5(a ) ) . however , our results suggest that the divergence of @xmath70 for a finite critical @xmath47 , close to @xmath48 , still occurs . on the other hand , in the range @xmath11 ,",
