    "one of the many skills involved in learning how to play the clarinet is to control the attack of a new note .",
    "tonguing is an important aspect of a clear and precise attack , but the evolution of the mouth pressure during the first instants of the note is also seen to affect the attack considerably .",
    "moreover , in some particular situations , tonguing may not be involved in starting a new note .",
    "hence there is both scientific and practical interest in the question : what combinations of tonguing and evolution of the blowing pressure produces sharp and precise attacks ?    as a self - sustained musical instrument ,",
    "the clarinet can be seen as a dynamic system in which the oscillation is controlled by input parameters from the musician .",
    "two of the most important @xcite are the blowing pressure and the lip force upon the reed .",
    "models predict the range of parameter values that allow for the production of a musical note @xcite .",
    "other useful predictions are the dependence of amplitude of oscillation on these two parameters , period doubling bifurcation points @xcite , or the parameter regions where the reed touches the lay of the mouthpiece .",
    "@xcite .",
    "more complex models exist that can simulate the reed oscillation in time - domain @xcite or harmonic balance methods @xcite .",
    "they provide more accurate predictions but their complexity makes it hard to grasp the causality relation between parameters and consequences in oscillatory behaviour .    in previous studies in which mouth pressure was gradually increased at constant rates , oscillations appeared at a much higher mouth pressure threshold than that predicted assuming a constant mouth pressure .",
    "high thresholds were observed in an artificially blown clarinet @xcite and even higher in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "analytical reasoning  @xcite based on dynamic bifurcation theory @xcite predicts a delay in the threshold of oscillation for a linearly increasing mouth pressure , but the exact value of mouth pressure at which it occurs is only valid for simulations performed with very high precision .",
    "the threshold observed with normal precision simulations can only be explained with a modified theory @xcite using stochastic perturbations @xcite .",
    "this article extends previous studies by the present authors by switching the focus from the threshold of oscillation to a complete description of the amplitude of oscillation .",
    "a simplified model of a note attack is a constant increase in the mouth pressure ( as used in previous articles ) which ceases increasing and then remains constant at a defined value .",
    "the effect of ceasing the pressure increase is studied analytically to develop a full recipe for estimating the envelope of the attack .",
    "this recipe is then explored by comparing to actual simulations of the raman model .    in section [ sec : clari - theo ] , the model of the clarinet used in this work is briefly presented , as well as some of its known properties .",

    "a non - linear function @xmath2 relates the pressure difference between the mouth and the mouthpiece ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mouth pressure ) to the volume of air that flows past the reed ( @xmath1 ) .",

    "so far it has been hard to relate the amplitude envelope to the value of the mouth pressure . in interrupted ramps of the mouth pressure however , the oscillations seem to be triggered close to the inflection point of the blowing pressure  @xcite . in this case , an exponential amplitude growth then resumes .",
    "this is as expected for low values of @xmath135 , as shown in the example in section [ sec : small - gamma_m ] .",
    "the values of @xmath4 at the start of the oscillation depend on the rate of growth of the mouth pressure , an indication that the system is determined by the stochastic fluctuations in the mouth pressure .",

    "@xmath191  @xcite gives the approximate value of the mouth pressure parameter for which an audible sound appears , or in other terms , the distance from the invariant @xmath107 curve becomes `` macroscopic '' .",
    "when the linear growth of the mouth pressure is suddenly stopped at @xmath136 and then kept constant at a value @xmath135 , two situations must be distinguished :    1 .",

    "@xmath194 : the audible ( `` macroscopic '' ) sound begins at @xmath195 ( see sections  [ sec : large - gamma_m ] and [ sec : effectnoise ] ) .    in most practical cases",
    "the latter situation is more common : because of the limited precision or noise , @xmath191 is effectively reduced to values that are much closer to the static threshold .",
    "this work shows that the amplitude envelope produced with a regular increase of blowing pressure in a simplified clarinet system can be described reasonably well by the use of a single function @xmath79 that is a characteristic of the system .",
    "this function can be used in exact and `` noisy '' cases to describe the envelope beyond the static threshold @xmath74 .    when the pressure increase is interrupted , the exponential envelope corresponding to the transient of a static - parameter case can be matched with the one corresponding to growing pressures . in many practical cases ,",
    "when the interruption occurs at sufficiently low values of the blowing pressure , this corresponds to a fixed starting amplitude so that the transient time measured from the interruption is roughly independent of the previous history of the system .",
    "these conclusions show some dramatic effects of the stabilisation of the mouth pressure that are due to the discontinuity in derivative .    in summary , a sudden cessation in the increase inmouth pressure can have a large impact in the initial transient of the clarinet if it appears at a low enough value of mouth pressure .",
    "a preliminary comparison with a smoother stabilisation profiles @xcite suggests that smoother profiles give rise to slower transients .",
