    ", there can be quantum phase transitions @xcite characterized by an order parameter with the possible development of long - range order and a transition to a broken symmetry state .",
    "interactions can also lead to `` mott insulators '' ( mi ) and to metal - insulator transitions @xcite .",
    "an important question is whether or not in the thermodynamic limit a mott insulator must be associated with a phase transition that is accompanied by a broken symmetry and a corresponding order parameter . in his original work ,",
    "mott @xcite argued that the insulating character did not depend upon an order parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "slater @xcite emphasized the relation of the insulating behavior to the long range order , and in many cases it is known that the mi state must be accompanied by a broken symmetry@xcite .",
    "to address such issues theoretically we must have methods that can clearly distinguish metals from insulators , i.e. , the ability to transport charge@xcite vs. localization of the electrons@xcite .",
    "insulators at absolute zero can not transport arbitrary amounts of charge macroscopic distances across their bulk ; however , the center of electronic charge can shift in response to external fields , which is described in terms of changes in polarization@xcite .",
    "the polarizability is characterized by the degree of electronic delocalization@xcite which increases with the proximity to the metallic state .",
    "recently , there have been new developments defining macroscopic polarization and localization in terms of the insulating ground state wavefunction@xcite .",
    "these theories formulate the polarization and localization in terms of berry s phases @xcite which can be calculated using `` twisted boundary conditions '' or in terms of the expectation value of an exponentiated operator .",
    "such twisted boundary conditions have been applied in the past to study metals and approach metal - insulator transitions from the metallic side@xcite . with the recently developed methods for insulators , there are now complementary tools@xcite to provide quantitative information on the divergence of the localization length as one approaches the metal - insulator transition from the insulating side",
    ".    generalized hubbard models @xcite are well - suited for studies of fundamental issues regarding metals and insulators because they are simple models that exhibit a wide range of behaviors depending upon the parameters in the models .",
    "the simplest of all , the original hubbard model with an on - site interaction @xmath5 and nearest neighbor hopping @xmath6 in @xmath4 , was solved exactly by lieb and wu  @xcite .",
    "their paper , entitled `` absence of mott transition ... '' , conveys the point that there is no change of spatial symmetry and no phase transition at any positive u. at half - filling the model is metallic at @xmath7 , whereas at any positive interaction u a gap exists to charge excitations but no gap exists to spin excitations .",
    "this is commonly referred to as the mi state , but in this case there is no `` mott transition '' . at any other",
    "filling , the model is always metallic .",
    "there is never a state that would be called an ordinary band insulating ( bi ) state .",
    "however , in systems of higher dimensionality ( @xmath8 ) , a mi state is always accompanied by a broken symmetry@xcite .",
    "many new possibilities emerge for generalized hubbard models in @xmath4 .",
    "the ionic @xmath0d hubbard model with two inequivalent sites , proposed by nagaosa@xcite and later by egami@xcite as a model ferroelectric , is ideal for studying how quantized particle transport is modified by electron correlation in a many body system . on general grounds we expect a transition to occur from an ionic band insulator to a strongly correlated mott insulator as @xmath5",
    "is increased .",
    "evidence for such a transition was found in exact - diagonalization calculations@xcite , where the electronic polarization was found to jump abruptly between two discrete values fixed by the existence of two centers of inversion at the two sites .",
    "such behavior has been termed a `` topological transition '' @xcite that occurs in finite systems and therefore is distinct from a true quantum phase transition .",
    "these solutions predict that the model has a metallic point separating two insulating phases and that a ferroelectric polarization results only if the atomic sites are displaced from the centers of inversion .    however , recently fabrizio , et al.,@xcite have proposed that this model will instead exhibit two quantum phase transitions : one from a bi state to a long range bond ordered ( bo ) state , predicted to be in the ising universality class , and a second from the bo to the mi state , predicted to be a kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "such transitions to bo states have recently been found in @xmath0d hubbard models with extended interactions ( u - v ) by nakamura.@xcite the bo state is a broken symmetry state in which the system becomes ferroelectric due strictly to electron - electron interactions even if all the atoms are at centers of inversion .    during the course of the present work ,",
    "two preprints have reported calculations of charge and spin gaps in the model@xcite . even though each work uses the density matrix renormalization group ( drmg ) that allows studies of very large 1d systems , each group reports great difficulty in extrapolating to large size the small spin gaps and the two papers come to opposite conclusions regarding the existence of the bo state .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the ionic hubbard model using a method that ( i ) will treat electron correlation exactly and ( ii ) scale to large systems needed to treat systems near second - order phase transitions .",
    "for these reasons we use quantum monte carlo @xcite(qmc ) which in principle is exact since there is no `` fermion sign problem '' in this particular @xmath0d model ( so long as there is non - zero overlap between our trial function and the true ground state ) . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first qmc study of polarization and localization in any system , and the first study of the ionic hubbard model with systems large enough to determine quantitatively the nature of the transitions and whether or not there exists the spontaneously bond - ordered phase proposed by fabrizio , et al.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , if there are indeed quantum phase transitions in the ionic model  whereas it is known that there are none in the usual non - ionic hubbard model  then it follows that one must address the issue : is a critical degree of ionicity required , or is the usual hubbard model unstable to infinitesimal ionic perturbations ?",
    "it is known @xcite that the usual hubbard model is unstable to dimerization at all @xmath5 .",
    "thus a second question is : does this instability play a fundamental role in stabilizing the bond - ordered state ?",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we introduce the model studied in this paper . in certain cases , depending upon the parameters of the hamiltonian , this model is exactly soluble .",
    "we discuss the relevance of these solutions to the more general case studied in this paper . in sec .",
    "iii formulas for evaluating the electronic polarization and localization are presented . in sec iv",
    ", we introduce the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods employed to evaluate expectation values and we describe their respective limitations .",
    "these are variational and green s function monte carlo algorithms and the `` forward walking '' method for computing expectation values of operators that do not commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "our results are presented in sec .",
    "v and comparisons are made with previous studies using exact diagonalization and hartree - fock . in section",

    "there is no change of symmetry from the case of @xmath7 ( which is a metal ) and at  very large \" @xmath19 the system reduces to the heisenberg spin model , which also has no long range order or spin gap in one dimension . for large",

    "the limiting cases ( i ) and ( ii ) are also instructive for our purposes . in the former ( @xmath46 )",
    "there is a transition at @xmath47 from a singlet state with two electrons on the site with on site energy @xmath48 , which is like a band insulator , to a state with one electron per site which has a spin on each site and is like a mott insulator .",

    "is there a spontaneous@xcite bond - ordered phase ?",
    "we shall test these ideas with our qmc simulations applied to the general case where there are no exact analytic solutions .",
    "the issues associated with calculating the electric polarization in an extended system have a long , torturous history@xcite .",
    "only recently have formulas been devised that express the polarization and localization of electrons directly in terms of the ground state wavefunction@xcite .",
    "one type of formulation measures the change in polarization as a berry s phase obtained by integrating over twisted boundary conditions and an adiabatic parameter that characterizes the evolution of the system as it moves from one state to another@xcite .",
    "this approach has also been extended to localization in an independent particle formulation@xcite and recently in a many - body formalism@xcite .",
    "an alternative approach has been developed by resta and sorella@xcite and others@xcite , who expressed the electronic polarization and localization in terms of the expectation value of a complex operator @xmath53 where the average is taken with respect to a truly correlated many body wavefunction utilizing periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) sampled using one of the quantum monte carlo techniques discussed in section iv . in terms of @xmath54",
    "the polarization of the many body ground state can be expressed as @xmath55 and a measure of the electronic delocalization is given by @xmath56 these expressions are exact only in the limit of an infinitely large system , and in practice one measures each for increasingly larger supercells until convergence is met .",
    "recently souza et al @xcite have shown that eqs  [ polarization ] and  [ localization ] are in fact valid in a correlated many - body system and related this formulation to that using twisted boundary conditions .",
    "they also demonstrated that the formulas relate directly to measurable fluctuations of the polarization , thus validating the two formulas as direct measures of electronic polarization and delocalization .    to our knowledge",
    "the present work is the first study of polarization and localization on large systems with fully - correlated many - body wavefunctions sampled using qmc .",
    "previous work has been limited to exact diagonalization studies on small systems or mean field methods such as dft and hf . for our work",
    "we use quantum monte carlo methods techniques with eqs  [ polarization ] and  [ localization ] because these are directly in the form of expectation values of quantities using wavefunctions that have the usual periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this is a great advantage in qmc since we can use the same methods developed for other problems @xcite .",
    "the approach using twisted boundary conditions would require a change in the algorithms , in particular the adoption of a `` fixed - phase''@xcite rather than a fixed node method .",
    "such an approach would have important advantages , the most significant that it would allow calculations of polarization and localization to be done on smaller supercells@xcite .",
    "there are other reasons that we prefer to use the standard boundary conditions : we shall see that very large cells are readily handled in qmc and furthermore the ability to work with large systems is very important in conclusions on the nature of the phase transitions in this study .",

    "[ hamiltonian ] . in order to understand the meaning of the polarization and bond order in this system , it is helpful to consider first the non - interacting case with @xmath7 , where one can visualize the electronic properties in terms of wannier functions . at zero dimerization ( @xmath123 )",
    "the wannier functions are centered on the sites whose onsite energy is shifted by @xmath157 and @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath17 electrons of opposite spin in each unit cell both occupy the lowest energy wannier function centered on the lower energy site . in the dimerized lattice ( @xmath117 ) ,",
    "the centers are displaced from the sites .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath121 dictates the amount by which they are off center from the lowest energy site while sign of @xmath121 determines whether the center is to the left or right of this site . strictly speaking the existence of wannier functions in correlated systems ( @xmath41 )",
    "has yet to be proven but we will continue to use the concept of the center of the localized states for illustrative purposes . as u increases the electrons",
    "find it energetically undesirable to occupy the same site , and in the dimerized state the center of the distribution shifts further away from the low energy site .",
    "the limit of this displacement ( i.e. , polarization ) is @xmath158 since one would never favor having more than one electron on the higher energy site .",
    "similarly , the limit of the bond order is @xmath159 corresponding to isolated dimers .    as @xmath51",
    "there are only three possibilities .",
    "if there is a spontaneous breaking of the inversion symmetry the polarization can assume any fractional value between 0 and 1/2 . if there is no breaking of symmetry , there are still two possibilities since there are two centers of symmetry : the polarization can be 0 or 1/2 .",
    "if the reference point defined to be zero is the usual band insulator where both electrons occupy the wannier function centered on the lower energy site , it has been proposed@xcite that p = 1/2 corresponds to a mott insulator with no long range order .",
    "we first report results of our study of the ionic hubbard model with parameters fixed at the values used in previous work@xcite , so that direct comparisons can be made .",
    "the energy scale is set by defining @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "the previous conclusions with which we will compare are based upon exact diagonalization of the many - body hamiltonian in small supercells@xcite and hartree - fock calculations@xcite .",
    "the study@xcite using exact diagonalization of @xmath163 site lattices with twisted boundary conditions found a jump of @xmath110 in the electronic polarization for @xmath164 , i.e. an electron in each unit cell being transported @xmath110 lattice constant , at a critical value of @xmath5 ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "this was interpreted as a transition between bi and mi phases , which was supported by hartree fock ( hf ) calculations that showed similar behavior at @xmath166 .",
    "extrapolations using larger cells of @xmath167 sites@xcite find @xmath168 , presumably a more converged value .",
    "the key points are : ( i ) the transition point @xmath169 is found to be a metallic point with divergent delocalization ; ( ii ) effective charges diverge and change sign at the transition ; and ( iii ) there is no sign of the bond - ordered state predicted by fabrizio , et al.@xcite .",
    "this new state would have long range order and break the inversion symmetry of the lattice , thus allowing the polarization to take any fractional value .",
    "the present work is based upon the qmc algorithms described earlier and the formulas for polarization and localization in section iii .",
    "the first step in applying the qmc methods is to find a trial wavefunction that has as much overlap with the true ground state as possible .",
    "this is achieved by optimizing the parameters @xmath170 to minimize the energy . to determine the optimal value of @xmath171 we have used a newly devised technique that significantly reduces the amount of computational effort required @xcite . using the optimal gutzwiller parameter the energy of @xmath76 for different @xmath172 and @xmath73",
    "is sampled using vmc .",
    "we adjust @xmath172 and @xmath73 to lower the vmc energy and measure it at several points in the neighborhood of its minimum .",

    "previous studies distorted the lattice by varying degrees and these results provide a basis of comparison with qmc .",
    "we have measured the polarization of the ionic lattice for large ( @xmath173 ) and small ( @xmath174 ) lattice distortions and plotted these with the corresponding results of previous studies in fig  [ fig2 ] .",
    "size effects are accounted for by extrapolating to the thermodynamic limit in @xmath175 ; this will be outlined more clearly in the following section .",
    "the lanczos results agree well with those of qmc for @xmath173 considering the fact they were obtained using @xmath163 site supercells with twisted boundary conditions .",
    "this is in agreement with previous studies using exact diagonalization @xcite on the usual hubbard model which found that small cells of this size were sufficient to reach thermodynamic convergence in the @xmath176 regime , whereas convergence with cell size is worse for smaller @xmath121 .",
    "( the jump in the polarization found in hf calculations for non - zero @xmath121 is unphysical and arises because the mean field approximation leads to an anti - ferromagnetic ground state . in @xmath4",

    "as the magnitude of the distortion ( @xmath121 ) approaches @xmath156 the difference between qmc and lanczos becomes greater .",
    "studies using exact diagonalization and hf observed that the polarization as a function of @xmath121 tended to @xmath156 below a critical @xmath5 and @xmath110 above it ; consequently the dynamic charge was observed to change sign upon crossing this critical point . in the lower plot of fig  [ fig2 ] this",
    "is exhibited as a crossing of the curves for @xmath177 .",
    "on the contrary we observe that the dynamic charge remains the same sign for the entire range of @xmath5 studied ( except that the sign of @xmath178 is difficult to establish for large @xmath5 where it is near zero ) .",
    "this difference is attributed to the fact that for small @xmath123 and for @xmath5 near @xmath169 the electrons are very delocalized and correlation lengths exceed the cell size@xcite .",
    "integrating over twisted boundary conditions provides thermodynamically quenched expectation values so long as the wannier functions of the eigenstates @xmath179 have vanishing overlap .",
    "near the critical point the @xmath179 , obtained by exact diagonalization of @xmath163 and @xmath167 site rings , do overlap significantly ; consequently , regardless of the number of k - space points averaged over by resta and sorella , the polarization will not converge to that of qmc .    the average polarization in fig  [ fig2 ]",
    "was measured using forward walking . for the polarization at these values of @xmath121 ,",
    "forward walking is not essential and the same results can be obtained using eq  [ groundstateapproximation ] .",
    "however , localization is more sensitive to inaccuracies in the wavefunction and accurate expectation values are provided only by using forward projection even at these relatively large values of @xmath121 . as the level of dimerization is reduced such that @xmath180 the extrapolation technique breaks down and only forward projection can provide accurate estimates for polarization and localization . consequently we only report in this paper those qmc results obtained using forward projection .",
    "the observation of a topological transition in the work of resta and sorella , and guidopoulos , et al . , is based upon their finding that as @xmath122 the polarization jumps discontinuously from 0 to 1/2 at a critical @xmath181 ( or @xmath182 ) .",
    "this means that the dynamic charge ( @xmath183 ) , defined as @xmath184 , diverges and changes sign at @xmath185 as @xmath122 . in latter work",

    "we will compare these results with our work below .",
    "we have measured the forward walking estimators for @xmath187 , @xmath151 and @xmath186 and taken the limit of @xmath188 to study the nature of the quantum phase transition .",
    "the formulas used to obtain expectation values for polarization and localization are only accurate in the limit @xmath189 .",
    "this limit is taken by fitting measurements at finite @xmath112 to a linear least squares fit in @xmath190 and extrapolating to @xmath156 .",
    "we have found @xmath191 to accurately account for the finite size effects of @xmath187 and @xmath127 for @xmath186 .",
    "this scaling has only been found appropriate upon increasing the supercell size above a critical threshold which depends on the proximity of the metallic state .",
    "the accuracy of the finite size corrections to @xmath187 are illustrated in fig  [ pdifflextrap ] at @xmath192 for different magnitudes of @xmath121 .",
    "the data in fig  [ pdifflextrap ] was collected near the critical point of the phase transition , where size effects are large and must be treated accurately .",
    "if the system is sufficiently far from such a critical point , size effects are less pronounced and there is a more rapid convergence to the thermodynamic limit .    using the infinite @xmath112 estimates for the polarization and localization on lattices dimerized by @xmath193 we have performed a linear least squares fit and extrapolated to the centrosymmetric limit ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "this method makes the assumption that the response of the lattice to dimerization is linear .",
    "however , near the phase transition non - linearity will cause this to break down . in fig  [ plvsud5714 ]",
    "we have plotted the polarization and localization of the ionic model for different magnitudes of dimerization .",
    "the phase transition we observe using qmc differs from the topological transition found using exact diagonalization and hf .",
    "as previously mentioned , in the bi and mi phases the polarization is restricted to @xmath156 or @xmath110 .",
    "resta and sorella identified the shift from @xmath156 to @xmath110 as the signature of a @xmath194 transition .",
    "however , we observe that @xmath187 takes a continuous range of values in the centrosymmetric limit which can not occur in either the bi or the mi phase .",
    "this can only occur if the global inversion symmetry of the lattice is broken by a long range bond ordered state , predicted by fabrizio et al @xcite on the basis of field theory arguments in which he mapped the hamiltonian onto two ising spin models .",
    "the order parameter of this phase transition is the average bond order function @xmath151 , where @xmath29 is given in eq  [ dimerization ] .",
    "the spontaneous bond order of the centrosymmetric lattice is obtained by extrapolating to @xmath123 the @xmath195 of the same distorted lattices as before .",
    "we fixed the supercell size to @xmath196 sites and found the consequent size effects are within order of the error with which we can measure the bond order .",
    "these results are plotted in fig  [ dimerplot ] .",
    "we have attempted to classify the quantum phase transition by fitting the polarization and bond order of the centrosymmetric lattice to a function of the form @xmath197^{\\xi},\\ ] ] where @xmath198 is the critical exponent and determines the universality class of the transition .",
    "a non - linear least squares routine was used to fit the data , with fitted parameters @xmath169 , @xmath125 , and @xmath198 listed in table i. in fig  [ criticalfit ] the data for @xmath187 and @xmath151 and the corresponding fits are plotted .",
    "both quantities behave similarly near the critical point and the @xmath169 of each is nearly identical .",
    "we find @xmath198 for @xmath187 and @xmath151 are near @xmath110 , the expected mean field exponent . on the other hand , fabrizio , et al.@xcite , predicted that the transition is of the ising universality class and thus @xmath198 should be @xmath199 .",
    "we do not know whether the difference is real or it is simply due to the possibility that the range of @xmath200 over which the scaling belongs to the universality class is too small for us to observe in the present work .",
    "alternatively , the existence of the bond ordered state can be observed by directly studying the symmetric lattice without any lattice distortion .",
    "quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) are characterized by a symmetry breaking that occurs in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "below @xmath169 the lattice is a band insulator with no bond order but above @xmath169 the electrons will spontaneously choose to bond order with @xmath201 .",
    "there are two such states characterized by the same magnitude but opposite sign of the bond order . for any finite system",
    "the ground state remains a linear combination of both .",
    "however in the limit @xmath189 one of these is arbitrarily chosen as the ground state .",
    "even though the qmc simulations of the symmetric lattice for @xmath202 measure zero bond order and polarization for long simulations , the imaginary time evolution of the simulations clearly depict the projected ground state moving from one of these bond ordered states to the other .",
    "this phase separation gives rise to large auto correlation times .",
    "the evolution of the bond order and polarization in imaginary time are illustrated in fig  [ phasesep ] for @xmath203 and @xmath204 sites . as the ground state moves between bo states of opposite symmetry both the polarization and dimerization",
    "are observed to change sign .",
    "this provides an alternative method of detecting the existence of the bo state .    at large @xmath5",
    "one might expect that the ionic @xmath4 hubbard model is a mott insulator .",
    "fabrizio , et al.@xcite , predict the existence of a kosterlitz - thouless transition for large @xmath2 at which the lattice becomes a mott insulator .",
    "such a transition would be characterized by polarization of @xmath110 and no bond order . on the contrary we do not observe either for any @xmath5 considered which included values up to @xmath205 .",
    "the bond order does diminish but appears to asymptotically approach @xmath156 and the polarization appears to converge to @xmath110 only in the limit of @xmath206 . yet working with such strongly correlated systems has the disadvantages that ( i ) fluctuations of the local estimators increase due to greater inaccuracies in the trial wavefunction and ( ii ) forward walking works so long as the trial wavefunction has some overlap with the exact ground state and as u increases overlap with the exact ground state diminishes .      an alternative approach to study the phase transition(s )",
    "is to diminish the ionic potential @xmath1 while keeping @xmath5 fixed , so that the ratio @xmath2 increases .",
    "we have fixed the strength of electron correlation to @xmath132 and studied the bond order and polarization for @xmath207 .",
    "the behavior of the centrosymmetric lattice is inferred using two approaches ( i ) extrapolating results obtained on lattices with @xmath208 and ( ii ) looking for evidence of phase separation in the symmetric case .",
    "fig  [ pbvsdelta ] shows the results of the first approach for a fixed supercell length of @xmath196 sites . in the first we ve neglected size effects and fixed the super cell length to @xmath196 sites . at large @xmath1 the single body contribution to the hamiltonian is the dominant term and the lattice is a band insulator .",
    "consequently the bond order and polarization are @xmath156 . however , as @xmath209 a transition occurs to a bo state where the bond order is non - zero and the polarization assumes values between @xmath156 and @xmath110 as before .",

    "the bond order in the @xmath210 limit is shown by the dotted line in fig  [ pbvsdelta ] .",
    "these results were obtained by linearly extrapolating the bond order at finite @xmath121 .",
    "( no extrapolation was performed for the polarization since it is sensitive to size effects that were addressed in the previous section . )",
    "our results indicate the bond - order state exists at all values of @xmath211 studied .",
    "the finite value of the bond order for @xmath51 shown in fig  [ pbvsdelta ] contrasts sharply with the vanishing of the bond order as @xmath210 for the non - ionic hubbard model ( @xmath39 ) as shown in fig  [ ed24vsuplahub ] . at @xmath44",
    ", we always find @xmath212 and polarization equal 1/2 as they must be for a mi state with no long range order .",
    "however , our qmc simulations of the symmetric case ( @xmath123 and @xmath132 ) at the smallest value of the ionic potential studied @xmath213 reveal two bo states phase separating in imaginary time qualitatively the same as shown in fig  [ phasesep ] .",
    "thus from our studies , there is no sign of a second transition to a mi state as proposed by fabrizio , et al.@xcite , and the long range bond ordered state in fig  [ pbvsdelta ] appears to exist for any finite @xmath211 .",
    "this implies that the mi state in @xmath4 exists only within the usual hubbard model and in ionic hubbard lattices only in the limit @xmath214 . at large @xmath5",
    "the ionic hubbard model has been mapped onto the heisenberg spin model .",
    "the present finding suggests that such a mapping may be insufficient for hubbard models with ionic potentials and that terms ignored or considered small possibly play a fundamental role .",
    "existence of a long range bond ordered state can be inferred by measuring the bond order correlation function ( @xmath215 ) .",
    "we define @xmath215 as @xmath216 where @xmath33 is defined in eq .",
    "[ dimerization ] and is the strength of the @xmath34 bond of the lattice .",
    "if the bo state exists then this correlation function would be staggered as a consequence of the periodic arrangement of dominant and weak bonds . in fig .",
    "[ bondordercorrfuncts ] @xmath215 is plotted for @xmath217 separate cases : ( i ) @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath204 ( ii ) @xmath220 , @xmath132 , @xmath221 ( iii ) @xmath39 , @xmath222 , @xmath221 and ( iv ) @xmath218 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 .",
    "the first case corresponds to the band insulating regime in which @xmath215 exponentially approaches a constant , confirming the lack of any long range ordered phase .",
    "conversely in the last case , which corresponds to the system in fig  [ phasesep ] that exhibited phase separation , its clearly visible that @xmath215 is staggered , signifying the presence of a long range bond ordered state .",
    "finite size effects in each of these cases were determined to be miniscule and small systems were deemed sufficient to measure @xmath215 .",
    "the second case corresponds to diminishing @xmath1 so as to move the system towards the established mott state of the usual hubbard model . at this point in the phase diagram the wells of the bimodal distribution",
    "are weakly defined ; thus making it extremely difficult to observe the phase separation of the bond order parameter directly .",
    "in contrast , the bond order correlation function is clearly staggered , though to a lesser degree than that of the later case .",
    "case iii ) is the mott state of the usual hubbard model .",
    "the staggered behavior of @xmath215 does not approach a finite limit at large @xmath223 , but rather tends to @xmath156 in a fashion that appears to be a power law ; contrary to the exponential convergence observed in the bi regime .",
    "comparison of cases ii ) and iii ) shows that in each case the staggered behavior of @xmath215 is longer ranged than in the band insulating and strongly bond ordered cases ; this exemplifies the difficulty of measuring the bond order or the phase separation of this generalized model as the ionic potential tends to zero .",
    "the staggered nature of @xmath215 can be used to determine the mean bond order of the lattice . defining two new variables",
    "@xmath224 \\cdot ( -1)^{r}\\ ] ] and @xmath225 and substituting eq  [ bocorrelationfunction ] in place of @xmath215 we can relate these two quantities in terms of measurable quantities . at large @xmath223 the @xmath34 and @xmath226 bonds",
    "are uncorrelated and @xmath227 is the rms bond order of the lattice whereas @xmath228 is the square of the average bond strength .    in the limit of large @xmath223 the average bond order @xmath119 can be expressed in terms of @xmath227 as : @xmath229 this estimate is exact when @xmath230 where @xmath231 is the correlation length .",
    "fig  [ b_r ] shows @xmath232 plotted vs r for the same cases as in fig  [ bondordercorrfuncts ] .",
    "the strongly bond ordered system converges to an estimate of the bond order that is remarkably close to that obtained by extrapolating from distorted lattices ( @xmath233 ) .",
    "the weakly bond ordered case appears to converge to a value near @xmath234 which is in reasonable agreement with the extrapolated value of @xmath235 .",
    "the band insulating estimate rapidly approaches @xmath156 as a function of @xmath223 , whereas the mott insulating system appears to approach @xmath156 in a power law fashion .",
    "one of the primary results of the present work is the quantitative demonstration of the stability of the bond - ordered phase for interaction @xmath5 above a critical value @xmath236 for any non - zero @xmath1 .",
    "most of our work was carried out through dimerizing the lattice by @xmath121 and examining the @xmath210 limit .",
    "there were two reasons for this : ( i ) this is an aid in the actual calculations which are stabilized by the applied bias , and ( ii ) the variation with dimerization @xmath121 is important in and of itself . regarding the second point ,",
    "it is well known that the ordinary non - ionic hubbard model is unstable to dimerization , with a logarithmic peierls instability at @xmath7 that becomes a stronger fractional power law instability at large @xmath5@xcite .",
    "our work shows that as a function of @xmath2 the ionic hubbard model undergoes a phase transition from a stable non - dimerized bi phase to a correlated phase in which the instability is _ more severe _ than in the non - ionic hubbard model .",
    "this is evident in comparison of fig.2 with figs . 5 and 7 .",
    "in the former for the non - ionic case , the decrease of the bond order with @xmath121 is clearly observed and is consistent with previous theoretical predictions of the power law form .",
    "however , in all the calculations for the ionic model for @xmath2 above the critical value , the average bond order @xmath151 is found to extrapolate to a non - zero value .",
    "this is observed even for @xmath121 much smaller than previous studies . from this evidence alone",
    "there are two possibilities : 1 ) the bo phase with broken symmetry is stable at zero dimerization , or 2 ) there is non - analytic behavior as @xmath51 which is even stronger than that for the non - ionic hubbard model .",
    "this result is sufficient to draw conclusions about real 1d systems in which the sites are allowed to dimerize if this leads to lower energy . in either scenario above dimerization",
    "would always occur ( except in the bi phase ) . in the former case",
    "the bo phase would occur spontaneously and by symmetry there would always be an accompanying lattice distortion . in the second scenario , dimerization would occur and lead to bond order . the symmetric mott insulator would never occur and the only transition would be from a bi phase to a dimerized bo phase .    at this point",
    "we can compare with experiment on 1d materials .",
    "experimental works by torrance , et al.,@xcite observed a second order transitions between neutral ( bi ) and ionic ( bo ) states in organic charge transfer solids .",
    "the transition occurs upon applying pressure over a wide range of temperatures and was attributed to the rise in madelung energy of the crystal .",
    "no state synonymous to the mott state was observed .",
    "in addition , however , calculations on the centrosymmetric lattice show directly existence of the bo phase in our simulations .",
    "one observation is the `` phase separation '' or ",
    "flip - flop between left and right bo phases as a function of imaginary time in the qmc simulations .",
    "the other is the staggered behavior of the bo correlation functions for which the numerical data out to large distance supports power law behavior in the non - ionic case and long range order in the ionic case .",
    "other work on related systems also has identified bo phases .",
    "recent work by nakamura @xcite in the extended hubbard model has found a rich phase diagram in which there are @xmath17 transitions from a @xmath237 and @xmath238 regime .",
    "the extended hubbard model differs from the ionic model studied here in that there is an additional next nearest neighbor coulomb potential @xmath239 and no ionic potential @xmath1 .",
    "nakamura identifies the first transition as belonging to the gaussian universality class and the later as a kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "the @xmath240 phase observed by nakamura exists at all @xmath239 down to the usual hubbard model ( @xmath241 ) ; where both the gaussian and the kt transitions coexist .",
    "we can imagine the @xmath169 at which the @xmath237 transition takes place increasing concurrently as the ionic potential is increased from zero .",
    "let us now consider why the bo phase was not found in previous studies that used exact diagonalization lanczos techniques to treat small finite systems@xcite .",
    "there are two reasons why these studies did not find the bo phase . in the bo phase",
    "the energy can parameterized by the bond order parameter ( eq  [ dimerization ] ) that develops a bimodal distribution with minima at @xmath242 .",
    "the true ground state is a linear combination of these @xmath17 degenerate bo states , @xmath243 which of course has no net bond order .",
    "the situation is similar in many aspects to a ferromagnet ; it is only in the thermodynamic limit that one or the other of the two states is the true ground state with long range order . for finite systems existence of the bo state",
    "can be inferred from correlation functions ; however , to our knowledge this has not been done in other work .    a second reason that the bo states have not been observed may be that there is no bimodal distribution for the small cells studied by exact diagonalization .",
    "we have addressed this issue using qmc by measuring the average bond order on distorted lattices of @xmath244 sites and extrapolating to the centrosymmetric limit . at this point in the phase diagram ( @xmath245 , @xmath246 )",
    "lattices with less than @xmath247 sites do not exhibit the bo phase and only upon working with larger supercells does qmc detect the phase separation of the two bo states . consequently , exact diagonalization methods are not currently feasible in such cases since they scale exponentially with @xmath112 .",
    "recent work using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method has reported results for charge @xmath248 and spin @xmath249 gaps in these models .",
    "this approach should enable one to distinguish the phases since ( i ) @xmath250 in the bi phase , ( ii ) @xmath251 in the bo phase , and ( iii ) @xmath252 but @xmath253 in the mi phase .",
    "it was found to be very difficult and to require extremely large cells to determine spin gaps in the bo / mi phases , and the two reports came to opposite conclusions on the existence of the bo phase . in our qmc calculations",
    "we have also determined the charge and spin gaps .",
    "our estimates of the charge gap are in qualitative agreement with other works ; however , the spin gap is very small in all cases except in the bi regime and statistical noise does not permit accurate determination of such small gaps in qmc .",
    "both dmrg calculations find the spin gap to vanish , i.e. , the mi phase to be the ground state for large @xmath5 .",
    "we have no direct explanation of this difference : it may be that our procedure is not sufficiently accurate to determine the bo - mi transition , which is the most difficult part of the present work .",
    "on the other hand , it may be that the dmrg calculations on finite cells with open boundary conditions may have difficulties : the surface effects break the symmetry of the problem which may lead to extremely problematic size effects and potential errors . in any case , we are very confident that our work establishes that the bo state is either the ground state or very close to the ground state in energy ; this is clear from our tests on the ordinary hubbard model shown in fig . @xmath0 .",
    "we have studied the phase diagram of an idealized dielectric , the @xmath0d ionic hubbard model proposed by nagosa@xcite and egami@xcite .",
    "this model undergoes a phase transition as a function of the on - site interaction @xmath5 , which has been a source of controversy .",
    "the only previous quantitative studies@xcite concluded that at a critical @xmath5 there is an abrupt `` topological '' transition from a band insulator to a mott insulator with no broken symmetry or long range order in either phase .",
    "the signature of the transition was found to be an abrupt change of @xmath110 in the polarization at which the effective charge diverged signifying the delocalization of the electron states@xcite .",
    "recently , however , there has been a prediction@xcite that this model would exhibit two quantum phase transitions : the first signifying a change of state from a band insulator to a broken symmetry phase with long range alternating bond order , and the second a transition to the mott insulator .",
    "we have studied this model using quantum monte carlo methods which allow the simulation of much larger systems than studied by exact diagonalization@xcite .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the first application of qmc to determine the polarization and localization of an electronic system .",
    "we evaluate the expectation values of the bond - order , polarization and localization using the expressions eqs  [ dimerization ] ,  [ polarization ] and  [ localization ] .",
    "it is found that upon crossing a critical value @xmath169 a change of phase occurs from a band insulating to bond - ordered state .",
    "the bond order develops continuously ( see fig  [ criticalfit ] ) as a function of @xmath254 and since the inversion symmetry is broken , the polarization also varies continuously , unlike the results of the small cell exact - diagonalization calculations.@xcite the critical behavior is uniquely determined by fitting the bond order and polarization to a scaling function near the critical regime .",
    "we find an exponent near 1/2 , which differs from that for the ising class proposed in ref  @xcite ; however , it may be that we are outside of the regime in which the scaling belongs to the appropriate universality class .",
    "in addition , we found that there is a metallic point at @xmath169 where the system is metallic . at this point",
    "the charge gap must vanish which we have found in pure ground state calculations by determining the fluctuations of the polarization .",
    "the calculations determine quantitatively the localization length@xcite , which diverges at the transition .",
    "an important part of the present qmc work is that we use a forward projection scheme which allows exact estimates , in principle , of any operator , including ones such as the polarization ( or center of mass position operator ) that do not commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore the nodes of this @xmath0d model are known exactly , so the qmc method is in principle exact . in order to confirm the existence of the bond ordered state",
    ", we carried out calculations on dimerized lattices ( @xmath255 ) whose inversion symmetry is explicitly broken , and let @xmath121 become small .",
    "qmc allows us to work with large enough lattices so as to study systems with levels of dimerization much smaller than previously feasible@xcite .",
    "we find good agreement with previous results obtained from the heisenberg spin model that predict electronic correlation enhances the instability to bond ordering.@xcite in addition , we can see from the simulations of the symmetric lattice that the system is alternating between the two degenerate states of bond - order ( see fig  [ phasesep ] ) .",
    "we have searched for the proposed transition to a mott insulating state , but we have not observed such a transition from the bond ordered regime even for very large @xmath5 or very small @xmath1 .",
    "even the smallest value of @xmath1 considered in this study ( @xmath256 ) is sufficient to cause the ionic hubbard model to be unstable to bond ordering , although there is no broken symmetry in the usual hubbard model ( @xmath257 ) , neither in the exact solution@xcite nor in our results .",
    "thus our results show that the instability to dimerization is even stronger in the ionic model than that known previously for the ordinary non - ionic hubbard model.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , for the centrosymmetric lattice ( @xmath164 ) , calculations of correlation functions and observations of `` flip - flop '' between left and right bond - ordered states in the qmc simulations provides further evidence for the stability of the bond - ordered state .    among the interesting consequences of the stability of the bo state",
    "is the existence of fractional charges.@xcite for the case of a dimerized or bond - ordered state , the charge is an irrational fraction the value of which depends upon the value of @xmath1@xcite .",
    "finally , these results imply that if dimerization is allowed ( which is always the case in real materials since the atoms can always dimerize if it lowers the energy ) then the symmetric mott state is never stable and the only phase transition is from the symmetric bi to the dimerized bo state .",
    "this is experimentally confirmed by torrance et al.@xcite ; where upon increasing the electronic interaction a @xmath258 transition takes place .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge erik koch for his help implementing lattice quantum monte carlo methods and david campbell , michele fabrizio , eduardo fradkin , erik koch , gerardo ortiz , rafaelle resta , anders sandvik , pinaki sengupta , ivo souza and david vanderbilt for invaluable discussions .",
    "this work would not have been feasible without the computational resources of the national supercomputing center at the university of illinois and the materials research laboratory .",
    "we are especially grateful to the nt supercluster , managed by rob pennington and michael showerman , which provided the majority of the computational resources for this study .",
