    "a puzzling and most prominent feature of the cosmic ray ( cr ) spectrum is the so - called knee , where the spectral index of the all - particle power - law spectrum changes from approximately @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "several models have been proposed in order to explain this feature shown in fig.[fig : all - particle - compilation ] , but none of them has managed to become broadly accepted .",
    "some models focus on a possible change in the acceleration mechanism at the knee  @xcite , e.g.  due to the limiting energy defined by the size and magnetic field strength of the acceleration region ( @xmath4 . other ones discuss an increased leakage of crs from the galaxy due to a change in the confinement efficiency by galactic magnetic fields  @xcite . again , this results in a rigidity scaling of the knee according to the maximum confinement energy . finally , a third group of models attributes the effect of the knee to cr interactions at their sources , during their propagation in the galaxy , or in the upper atmosphere .",
    "such scenarios include nuclear photodisintegration processes by uv - photons at the sources  @xcite , interactions of crs in dense fields of massive relic neutrinos  @xcite , production of gravitons in high - energy pp collisions  @xcite , etc .",
    "a recent review about this topic can be found e.g.  in refs .",
    "@xcite .    to distinguish between these models and allowing to answer the long pressing question about the origin of cosmic rays and about the knee in their spectrum ,",
    "high quality and high statistics data are required over an energy interval ranging from at least 0.5 to 500 pev .",
    "it appears worthwhile to mention that solving the old problem about the origin of crs in the pev region is a prerequisite also for an understanding of the highest energies in the gzk - region . due to the low flux involved , only extensive air shower ( eas )",
    "experiments are able to provide such data . in eas experiments ,",
    "primary crs are only indirectly observed via their secondaries generated in the atmosphere .",
    "the most important experimental observables at ground are then the electromagnetic ( electrons and photons ) , muonic , and hadronic components . in addition or alternatively , some experiments also detect photons originating from cherenkov and/or fluorescence radiation of charged particles in the atmosphere . for a brief review about eas observables and their experimental techniques",
    "the reader is referred to refs.@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , progress on interpreting eas data has been modest mostly because of two reasons : firstly , the eas development is driven both by the poorly known high - energy hadronic interactions and their particle production in the very forward kinematical region as well as by uncertainties in the low energy interaction models influencing mostly the lateral particle density distribution functions @xcite .",
    "secondly , due to the stochastic nature of particle interactions , most importantly the height of the very first interaction in the atmosphere , eas are subject to large fluctuations in particle numbers at ground . to make things even more complicated , the amount of fluctuations depends , amongst others , sensitively on the primary cr energy and mass  @xcite . here",
    ", it is very important to realize that eas fluctuations are not to be mistaken as random gaussian errors associated with the statistics in the number of particles observed at ground .",
    "the latter one can be improved by the sampling area of an eas experiment , while the former one is intrinsic to the eas itself , carrying - for a sample of events - important information about the nature of the primary particle .",
    "clearly , both kinds of fluctuations have to be accounted for in the data analysis of steeply falling energy spectra in order to not misinterpret the observations .",
    "kascade ( rlsruhe hower ore and rray tector ) is a sophisticated eas experiment for detailed investigations of primary crs in the energy range of the knee . for reconstructing the cr energy and mass and for investigating high - energy hadronic interactions",
    ", kascade follows the concept of a multi - detector set - up providing as much complementary information as possible as well as redundancy for consistency tests .",
    "most relevant for the results presented in this paper is the scintillator array comprising 252 detector stations of electron and muon counters arranged on a grid of @xmath5 m@xmath6 . in total , it provides about 500 m@xmath7 of @xmath8- and 620 m@xmath6 of @xmath9-detector coverage .",
    "the detection thresholds for vertical incidence are @xmath10 mev and @xmath11 mev .",
    "more details about the @xmath8- and @xmath9-detectors and all other other detector components can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the traditional and perhaps most sensitive technique to infer the cr composition from eas data is based on measurements of the electron ( @xmath12 ) and muon numbers ( @xmath13 ) at ground .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that for given energy , primary fe - nuclei result in more muons and fewer electrons at ground as compared to proton primaries .",
    "specifically , in the energy range and at the atmospheric depth of kascade , a fe - primary yields about 30% more muons and almost a factor of two fewer electrons as compared to a proton primary .",
    "the basic quantitative procedure of kascade for obtaining the energy and mass of the cosmic rays is a technique of unfolding the observed two - dimensional electron - vs - muon number spectrum of fig.[fig:2d ] into the energy spectra of primary mass groups  @xcite .",
    "the problem can be considered a system of coupled fredholm integral equations of the form @xmath14 where the probability @xmath15 + @xmath16   + is another integral equation with the kernel function @xmath17 factorizing into three parts . here",
    ", @xmath18 describes the shower fluctuations , i.e.  the 2-dim distribution of electron and truncated muon number for fixed primary energy and mass , @xmath19 describes the trigger efficiency of the experiment , and @xmath20 describes the reconstruction probabilities , i.e.  the distribution of @xmath12 and @xmath21 that is reconstructed for given _ true _ numbers @xmath22 , @xmath23 of electron and truncated muon numbers .",
    "the probabilities @xmath15 are obtained by parameterizations of eas monte carlo simulations for fixed energies using a moderate thinning procedure as well as smaller samples of fully simulated showers for the input of the detector simulations .",
    "because of the shower fluctuations mentioned above , unfolding of all 26 energy spectra ranging from protons to fe - nuclei is clearly impossible . therefore , 5 elements ( p , he , c , si , fe ) were chosen as representatives for the entire distribution .",
    "more mass groups do not improve the @xmath24-uncertainties of the unfolding but may result in mutual systematic biases of the reconstructed spectra @xcite .",
    "the unfolding procedure is tested by using random initial spectra generated by monte carlo simulations .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that knee positions and slopes of the initial spectra are well reproduced and that the discrimination between the five primary mass groups is sufficient .",
    "for scrutinizing the unfolding procedure , different mathematical ways of unfolding ( gold - algorithm , bayes analyses , principle of maximum entropy , etc . ) have been compared and the results are consistent  @xcite . for generating the kernel functions",
    "a large number of eas has been simulated  @xcite employing corsika  @xcite with the hadronic interaction models qgsjet ( version 2001 )  @xcite and sibyll 2.1  @xcite .",
    "=    the result of the unfolding is presented in fig.[fig : spectra ] for each of the two interaction models . clearly , there are common features but also differences in the energy distributions obtained with the two interaction models .",
    "the all - particle spectra coincide very nicely and in both cases the knee is caused by the decreasing flux of the light primaries , corroborating results of an independent analysis of ref.@xcite .",
    "tests using different data sets , different unfolding methods , etc .",
    "show the same behavior  @xcite .",
    "as the most striking difference , sibyll suggests a more prominent contribution of heavy primaries at high energies .",
    "this difference results from the different @xmath25-@xmath26 correlation shown in fig.[fig:2d ] , i.e.  sibyll predicts higher electron and lower muon numbers for given primaries as compared to qgsjet",
    ".    =    is there a way to judge which of the two models is better suited for describing the data ?",
    "this is done most easily by comparing the residuals of the unfolded two - dimensional @xmath25 vs @xmath26 distributions with the actual data used as input to the unfolding ( fig.[fig:2d ] ) .",
    "the result of such an analysis is presented in fig.[fig : chi2 ] in terms of @xmath24 . the deviations seen reveal some deficiencies of qgsjet at low electron and muon numbers and they nicely demonstrate that sibyll encounters problems in describing the high-@xmath25 - low-@xmath26 tail of the experimental data at 10 pev and above  @xcite . if not being prepared to accept an additional significant contribution of superheavy primaries ( @xmath27 ) required in case of sibyll simulations to fill the gap at high muon numbers , the results point to a muon deficit ( a / o electron abundance ) in this model .",
    "definitely , this problem needs further attention and will be very important also for composition studies at higher energies  @xcite .    with this caveats kept in mind",
    ", the kascade data favor an astrophysical interpretation of the knee and are in agreement with a constant rigidity of the knee position for the different primaries .",
    "similar results were very recently obtained from combined eas - top / macro measurements  @xcite , though for two mass groups only , and were again confirmed for three mass groups from eas - top electron and muon measurements  @xcite . within the given error bars , the mean logarithmic masses of both experiments agree well with one another .",
    "additional information about the cr origin and their propagation in the galactic environment can be obtained from global anisotropies in their arrival directions .",
    "model calculations show that diffusion of crs in the galactic magnetic field can result in anisotropies on a scale of @xmath28 to @xmath29 depending on the particle energy and on the strength and structure of the galactic magnetic field @xcite .",
    "since the diffusion scales again with the rigidity , a factor of 5 - 10 larger anisotropies are expected for protons as compared to iron primaries .",
    "this rigidity dependent diffusion is one of the possible explanations of the knee .",
    "=    due to the small anisotropy expected a large data sample and careful data selection is necessary .",
    "about @xmath30 eas events in the energy range from 0.7 to 6 pev were selected and studied in terms of rayleigh amplitudes @xmath31 and phases @xmath32 of the first harmonic . neither for the full set of data nor for electron - rich and -poor eas significant rayleigh amplitudes were found .",
    "the upper limit on the large scale anisotropy is depicted in fig.[fig : anisotropy ] @xcite and is in line with results reported from other experiments .",
    "we shall come back to this result in the next section .",
    "even though the location of cr sources should be obscured due to the deflection of charged particles in the magnetic field of our galaxy , there is interest to perform point source searches .",
    "for example , neutrons are not deflected and can reach the earth if their energy and hence decay length is comparable with the distance of the source .",
    "a decay length of 1 kpc corresponds to a neutron energy of about @xmath1 ev .",
    "also , by applying appropriate cuts to electron and muon numbers from eas , searches for @xmath33-ray point sources can be performed in the pev range .",
    "such a study has been performed based on 47 mio eas with primary energies above @xmath34 tev .",
    "a certain region in the sky is then analyzed by comparing the number of events from the assumed direction with an expected number of background events . for the latter ,",
    "the so - called time - shuffling method has been used . as a result ,",
    "again no significant excess is found in the region of the galactic plane or for selected point source candidates .",
    "assuming equal power laws in the energy spectra of background and source events , upper flux limits can be calculated for given energy thresholds . for a steady point source that transits the zenith , we obtain an upper flux limit of @xmath35 m@xmath36s@xmath37 ( see fig.[fig : anisotropy ] r.h.s . )",
    "this is roughly 1 - 2 orders of magnitude larger than the crab flux extrapolated to this energy .    very recently , chilingarian reported the detection of a source of high - energy crs in the monogem ring @xcite .",
    "changing slightly our cuts in zenith angle to widen the declination range thereby covering the position of the source candidate , we find 742 events within an opening angle of @xmath38 around the suggested location with an expected number of 716 background events yielding an upper flux limit of @xmath35 m@xmath36s@xmath37 .",
    "similar values are found when searching for an excess from the location of the pulsar psr b0656 + 14 located near the centre of the monogem snr @xcite .",
    "the new high quality data presented in the previous sections have revitalized the interest to understand both the origin of crs in the knee region and the phenomenon of the knee structure itself .",
    "=    this is because discriminating models of maximum acceleration energy from galactic diffusion / drift models of the knee or from particle physics interpretations require detailed inspection of knee structures seen in _ individual _ mass groups combined with precise measurements of cr anisotropies .",
    "targets of particular interest are the individual energies of the spectral break , the power - law indices below and above the knee , and the smoothness of the turn - over regions .",
    "even though , these goals are not yet achieved totally , important steps have been made to it .",
    "previous investigations were limited to inclusive cr all - particle spectra and to global changes of the mean logarithmic mass , @xmath39 , with primary energy .",
    "unfortunately , such measurements appear to be too insensitive for a convincing discrimination of models .",
    "furthermore , analyses were mostly restricted to investigating _",
    "mean _ values of distributions to be compared to eas simulations .",
    "this implies that deficiencies of hadronic interaction models easily remain unrecognized .    a very good example demonstrating the discrimination power of the new data presented here and showing the amount of information contained in it is given by a recent study of wick @xcite .",
    "based on the earlier suggested connection between gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and ultrahigh - energy crs @xcite they propose a model for the origin of crs from @xmath40  ev / nucleon up to the highest energies ( @xmath41  ev ) . in that model ,",
    "grbs are assumed to inject cr protons and ions into the interstellar medium of star - forming galaxies - including the milky way - with a power - law spectrum extending to a maximum energy @xmath42  ev .",
    "high - energy crs injected in the milky way diffuse and escape from our galaxy .",
    "ultra high - energy crs with energies @xmath43 to @xmath44ev that have larmor radii comparable to the size scale of the galactic halo escape directly from the milky way and propagate almost rectilinearly through extragalactic space . by the same token , uhecrs produced from other galaxies",
    "can enter the milky way to be detected .",
    "uhecrs formed in grbs throughout the universe then travel over cosmological distances and have their spectrum modified by energy losses , so an observer in the milky way will measure a superposition of uhecrs from extragalactic grbs and hecrs produced in our galaxy .    thereby , the cr spectrum near the knee is understood by crs trapped in the galactic halo that were accelerated and injected by an earlier galactic grb .",
    "assuming magneto - hydrodynamical turbulence superposed to the galactic magnetic field , a fit to the preliminary kascade data , shown in fig.[fig : wick - spectra ] , suggests a 500 pc distant grb that released @xmath45  ergs in crs if the grb took place about 210000 yrs ago . keeping in mind the still large uncertainties of the data and some freedom of parameters in the model",
    ", there is remarkable accordance observed . in this model ,",
    "the rigidity dependence of knee position is caused by galactic modulation effects .    since in this model",
    "a single galactic grb is responsible for most of the crs in the knee region , anisotropies in the arrival directions are expected on different levels , depending on the distance and age of the grb .",
    "for example , the authors state that if an anisotropy below @xmath46% is confirmed , then a number of implications follow .",
    "either we are located near a rather recent grb , which could be unlikely , or the cr energy release from grbs is larger than the one given above @xcite .",
    "thus , improving the anisotropy limits of the previous section would help to further pin down this model .",
    "however , before starting to over - interpret the data , we should emphasize again the influence of the interaction models to extracted energy spectra .",
    "more work is still needed to improve the models and to arrive at smaller systematic uncertainties .",
    "on the other hand , the very valuable study of an interesting model demonstrates the informational content reached by present data .",
    "=    the upper energy range of kascade is - besides event statistics - mostly given by its sensitive area of @xmath5 m@xmath6 limiting the reconstruction quality of the highest energy events .",
    "to improve the situation for eas beyond @xmath1 ev , kascade has recently been extended to kascade - grande by an installation of additional 45 detector stations ( 37 as _ grande _ array plus 8 as _ piccolo _ trigger array ) over an area of @xmath47m@xmath7 .",
    "a sketch of the experimental set - up is depicted in fig.[fig : ka - gr - ldf ] ( lhs ) . in the present configuration kascade - grande consists of @xmath48m@xmath7 of scintillator area for the electron component , of @xmath49m@xmath7 for measuring muons at four different muon energy thresholds , and of @xmath50m@xmath7 for high - energy hadron detection .",
    "thus , kascade - grande displays the full capability of a multi - detector experiment with much better muon sampling than any previous eas experiment in this energy range  @xcite . data taking has started in july 2003 and an example of lateral particle density distributions observed in a single eas is shown in fig.[fig : ka - gr - ldf ] ( rhs ) .",
    "the data quality and detector performance is evident .",
    "not shown are muon densities measured additionally with the kascade central detector and with the muon tracking detector .",
    "sensitivity to the primary mass is again given by the electron - muon density measurements as well as by reconstructions of the muon production height by means of triangulation @xcite .",
    "another goal of kascade - grande is the development and test of techniques for radio detection of eas .",
    "attempts to observe radio pulses from air showers were made during the late 1960s and they appear to experience a renaissance at present .",
    "the motivation arises from the facts that radio signals probe eas in the maximum of their longitudinal development , similarly to atmospheric cherenkov and fluorescence experiments .",
    "however , radio antennas would operate and observe eas 24 hrs a day while optical observations typically reach a duty cycle of 10% only .",
    "furthermore , the signals may be cheap to detect with new modern electronics allowing instrumentation of huge experiments . lofar ( low frequency array ) is a new major digital radio interferometer under development by radio astronomers @xcite . due to its fully digital nature",
    "it will be able to filter out interference and form beams even after a transient event like an eas has been detected . to test this new technology and demonstrate its ability to measure air showers , 10 prototype antennas for the frequency range of 40 to 80 mhz",
    "were installed in a joint venture ( lopes collaboration ) at the site of kascade - grande .",
    "coincidences observed will allow to reconstruct eas in a hybrid mode by both techniques , thereby allowing to judge the reliability and quality of the radio technique in a unique way @xcite .",
    "if proven successful , the radio technique offers new opportunities for instrumenting the next generation of giant eas experiments .",
    "kascade has provided a wealth of new high quality eas data in the knee region giving important insight into the origin of the knee and of crs in general .",
    "conclusive evidence has been reached on the knee being caused by light primaries mostly .",
    "furthermore , the data are in agreement with a rigidity scaling of the knee position giving support to an astrophysical origin by either maximum acceleration or diffusion / drift models of propagation .",
    "for example , the astrophysical parameters of the grb model of ref.@xcite are nicely constrained by the preliminary kascade data and are constrained furthermore by measurements of global anisotropies of crs .",
    "observations of a cr excess from the monogem snr can not be confirmed .",
    "presently , more data and more observables are being analyzed , particularly in terms of composition analyses employing reconstructions of the muon production height .",
    "together with measurements of energetic hadrons in the central calorimeter , the unfolding technique of electron and muon numbers in eas has become a powerful tool to reconstruct the properties of primary particles in eas and it also provides important clues on how to improve the hadronic interaction models employed in corsika simulations .    kascade - grande has just started its routinely data taking and will extend the measurements up to @xmath44ev , thereby allowing to verify the existence of the putative iron knee marking the so - called second knee in the all - particle cr spectrum .",
    "this , together with improved statistics for anisotropy measurements will allow to confront astro- and particle - physics motivated models of the knee in much more detail to the experimental data as is possible now .",
    "the use of radio antennas complementing the experimental kascade - grande set - up may open a new window to future eas observations on large scales .",
    "interesting first observations have been made and are presently being analyzed in detail ."
