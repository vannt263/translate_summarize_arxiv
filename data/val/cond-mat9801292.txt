    "complex fluids such as microemulsions , foams , and colloidal suspensions provide a wealth of interesting physical phenomena .",
    "their use is ubiquitous in the processing , energy and chemical industries .",
    "therefore it is important to explore ways in which their properties can be modelled numerically to test physical theories , predict behaviour and provide feedback to industrial planning .",
    "the modelling of complex fluids is not an easy task as both the rheology and the complicated phase behaviour of the fluid must be incorporated .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations , whilst providing an accurate picture of the microscopic physics , are usually too computer - intensive to address hydrodynamic time scales . in computational fluid dynamic solutions of the navier - stokes equations the specific behaviour of a given fluid can only be input via ad hoc constitutive relations .",
    "recently new methods of simulating fluid flow have become available .",
    "these include lattice - gas cellular automata@xcite , dissipative particle dynamics@xcite , and lattice boltzmann simulations@xcite .",
    "the aim is to reproduce the physics of fluid flow , primarily mass and momentum conservation , while including the important features of the underlying microscopic physics .",
    "these approaches have been successfully applied to several complex fluids including polymer solutions@xcite , particulate suspensions@xcite and microemulsions@xcite .",
    "however application of the techniques to model complex fluids is still in its infancy and validation of , and comparison between , the different methods is still needed .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on lattice boltzmann simulations .",
    "a fluid is modelled on a mesoscopic length scale by means of distribution functions which evolve according to a discretised version of a simplified boltzmann equation .",
    "the correct equilibrium behaviour is imposed by inputting the correct thermodynamics such that the system evolves to the minimum of a chosen input free energy@xcite .",
    "we use the lattice boltzmann approach to explore the kinetics of phase separation of a model , two - dimensional , fluid with lamellar and droplet equilibrium phases .",
    "our main conclusions are :    1 .",
    "when the system is quenched to the lamellar phase a glassy metastable state of tangled lamellae forms .",
    "however , hydrodynamic flow alleviates the frustration and allows the system to attain the striped ground state .",
    "2 .   as the concentration of the minority phase",
    "is increased the system prefers to phase separate into a lamellar and a one - component phase .",
    "the lamellae minimise their free energy by forming a spiral pattern around the one - component hole . again",
    "this state can only be reached by the fluid if hydrodynamic flow is allowed in the system .",
    "3 .   when one component of the binary fluid predominates droplets of the minority fluid form .",
    "their size is determined by the balance of the surface tension terms in the free energy .",
    "phase separation in this system is unaffected by hydrodynamics .",
    "sections 2 and 3 of the paper are devoted to a description of the model and the relevant thermodynamics and to a summary of the numerical approach respectively .",
    "section 4 summarises phase separation in a 50:50 fluid mixture emphasising the rle of hydrodynamics .",
    "the 60:40 mixture which phase separates into a lamellar and one - component state is considered in section 5 .",
    "section 6 treats the 90:10 composition ratio where droplets of the minority phase are stable .",
    "section 7 summarises the results , putting them in the context of previous work , and suggests directions for future research .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional binary fluid with components @xmath0 , @xmath1 of number density @xmath2 , @xmath3 respectively .",
    "this can be modelled by the landau free energy@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the order parameter of the system and we assume that the total density @xmath6 is constant .",
    "the free energy ( [ eqn1 ] ) corresponds to a disordered state at high temperatures ( @xmath7 ) and an ordered state at low temperatures ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "@xmath9 is related to the surface tension . for @xmath9",
    "sufficiently large the ordered phase consists of two coexisting bulk phases with @xmath10 , the volume of each determined by the initial ratio of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . as @xmath9 is decreased the formation of interfaces becomes favourable but the fluid remains stable because of the positive curvature energy related to @xmath11 in ( [ eqn1 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath12 the ordered state is then a striped or lamellar phase with the width of the lamellae being determined by the interface  interface interaction . for @xmath13",
    "this is replaced by a phase of circular droplets of @xmath0 in @xmath1 with radius determined by the balance between the negative surface tension and the positive curvature free energies of the interfaces .",
    "thermodynamic properties of the binary fluid follow directly from the free energy ( [ eqn1 ] ) .",
    "in particular we shall need the chemical potential @xmath14 which couples to the density difference @xmath15 @xmath16 obtaining the pressure tensor is slightly more complicated@xcite .",
    "the pressure parallel to the interface follows from ( [ eqn1 ] ) @xmath17 however off - diagonal terms must be added to ensure that the pressure tensor obeys the equilibrium condition @xmath18 considering a linear combination of all symmetric tensors having two or four gradient operators shows that a suitable choice is @xmath19",
    "the aim is to simulate a fluid with equilibrium properties described by the free energy ( [ eqn1 ] ) which obeys the navier - stokes and convection - diffusion equations . to this end",
    "we use a lattice boltzmann technique@xcite .",
    "we consider a square lattice and define two sets of distribution functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 on each lattice site @xmath22 .",
    "each @xmath23 is associated with a lattice vector @xmath24 .",
    "the results presented in this paper are for a 9-velocity model on a square lattice with @xmath25 .",
    "physical variables are related to the distribution functions through @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mean fluid velocity .",
    "the distribution functions undergo a collision step followed by a streaming step according to the evolution equations @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the time step , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are relaxation parameters , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are equilibrium distribution functions the choice of which determines the physics inherent in the simulation . equations ( [ eqn6 ] ) and ( [ eqn7 ] ) are discrete boltzmann equations with a bgk collision term@xcite .",
    "following the standard lattice boltzmann prescription we assume that @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be expanded as power series in the bulk velocity @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 the expansion coefficients @xmath39 are determined by @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath14 are given by ( [ eqn5 ] ) and ( [ eqn3 ] ) respectively and @xmath47 is a mobility .",
    "note that the conditions ( [ eqn10 ] ) , ( [ eqn11 ] ) , and ( [ eqn13 ] ) correspond to local conservation of density , momentum and density difference respectively .",
    "explicit expressions for the expansion coefficients are given in appendix a.    expanding ( [ eqn6 ] ) and ( [ eqn7 ] ) to order @xmath48 and using ( [ eqn10])([eqn15 ] ) leads to the macroscopic equations @xmath49",
    "@xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52    it is apparent from these equations of motion that the fluid will evolve through two competing growth mechanisms .",
    "the first of these is diffusion , described by eqn .",
    "( [ eqn22 ] ) with @xmath53 .",
    "the second is bulk momentum transfer or hydrodynamic flow described by the navier - stokes equation  ( [ eqn21 ] ) .",
    "the relative importance of diffusive and hydrodynamic flow can be altered by varying the viscosity @xmath54 through changes in @xmath31 ( see equation  ( [ eqn23 ] ) ) . for high viscosities",
    "the velocities remain sufficiently small that hydrodynamic flow is irrelevant and the evolution of the microstructure is diffusive . for low viscosities , however , the reynolds number becomes larger and hydrodynamic effects can dominate in changing the domain morphology .",
    "simulations run from the same initial conditions but with high or low viscosities enable us to build up a very clear picture of the effects of hydrodynamics on the domain growth .",
    "we first describe the behaviour of a symmetric binary fluid with a ratio of number densities @xmath55 of @xmath56 when it is quenched from a disordered state into the ordered region .",
    "our aim is to compare the path of the spinodal decomposition for different values of the surface tension and of the viscosity .",
    "initial results for this concentration have appeared elsewhere@xcite .",
    "for all runs the system was initialised with @xmath57 and @xmath15 chosen randomly between 0.5 and 0.5 .",
    "it was then quenched to a final state defined by parameters @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the simulations were run with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the system size was @xmath64 and simulations were typically run for @xmath65 time steps .",
    "this took approximately @xmath66 days on a dec alpha workstation .",
    "smaller lattice sizes gave similar results .",
    "for @xmath9 sufficiently negative the equilibrium state is a lamellar phase . after a quench at high viscosity",
    "the fluid gets stuck in a metastable state of lamellae which have approximately the correct width , but which are tangled . for low viscosity",
    ", however , hydrodynamic flow builds up and can remove topological defects from the system and allow the fluid to reach equilibrium .",
    "evidence for these conclusions is shown in figure  [ figure1 ] where snapshots of the domain growth are compared for three different sets of parameters :    * high viscosity , two - phase coexistence ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) , * high viscosity , lamellar equilibrium ( @xmath67 , @xmath69 ) , * low viscosity , lamellar equilibrium ( @xmath70 , @xmath69 ) .",
    "consider first ( a ) which is at a value of @xmath9 that corresponds to bulk phase separation and a value of @xmath31 that suppresses hydrodynamic flow .",
    "after initial transients sharp domains form . these are more elongated than for a system with @xmath71 but they grow continuously and become more isotropic .",
    "an exponent @xmath72 characterising the growth is commonly defined by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a length scale , which we take as the inverse of the first moment of the circularly averaged structure factor , and @xmath75 is the time@xcite . at late times",
    "@xmath72 converges to @xmath76 as expected for lifshitz - slyozov diffusive growth in a binary system",
    ". runs at different values of @xmath9 indicate that as @xmath9 is decreased an increasingly long time is taken to reach the @xmath76 regime@xcite .    for @xmath77",
    "there is a qualitative change in the behaviour of the system as shown in figure  [ figure1]b .",
    "these results were obtained for the same value of @xmath31 but with @xmath69 where the equilibrium is the lamellar state .",
    "now the system forms portions of lamellae of width approximately equal to the equilibrium value .",
    "these lamellae are tangled in a way that depends on the initial conditions .",
    "the diffusive growth to the tangled phase is slow , possibly logarithmic , and once the glassy phase has been reached there is no further discernable movement on the time - scale of the simulation . for smaller @xmath9",
    "the lamellae are thinner and the system freezes sooner .",
    "remaining with the value @xmath69 we then ran the same simulation ( starting from the same initial conditions ) for @xmath70 .",
    "the lower value of @xmath78 implies a lower viscosity and the possibility of hydrodynamic flow at earlier times .",
    "the initial behaviour was the same as for case ( b ) with a glassy lamellar phase being formed .",
    "however at a later time @xmath79 there was a significant change in the domain pattern .",
    "this is most easily seen from the snapshots in figure  [ figure1]c where it is apparent that the topological frustration of the glassy phase is being removed and the lamellae are lining up in the global equilibrium state .",
    "an example of the effect of hydrodynamic flow on the defects is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the lamellae are initially too wide .",
    "hydrodynamic forces tend to lengthen them causing the broken lamellar to join and the stripes to buckle . at high viscosities",
    "the defect does not disappear .",
    "we next consider a concentration ratio @xmath80 .",
    "now there is too little of the @xmath1-phase to form lamellae of the correct width throughout the system .",
    "we shall show that the equilibrium state corresponds to phase separation into a lamellar region coexisting with a bulk @xmath0-phase . as before equilibrium",
    "can only be reached with the help of hydrodynamic flow .",
    "simulations were again run at different values of @xmath31 and @xmath9 to provide a comparison .",
    "snapshots of the time evolution are shown in figure  [ figure3 ] for the same parameters as those used for the symmetric mixture considered in section iv .",
    "figure 4 is a double logarithmic plot of the variation of the domain size with time comparing the growth in the three different cases .",
    "column ( a ) of figure 3 shows the path to bulk phase separation for @xmath68 . droplets form by spinodal decomposition and then grow by lifshitz - slyozov diffusion .",
    "the curvature term in the free energy becomes less important for larger droplets and they become more circular .",
    "the data in figure 4 is consistent with the expected growth exponent @xmath81 at late times .",
    "figure 3b compares a simulation for @xmath69 , a value for which the lamellar phase is stable in the symmetric mixture .",
    "the value of @xmath31 is chosen so that only diffusive growth is possible .",
    "it is apparent from figure [ figure3]b that the final state is a mixture of droplets and short lamellae .",
    "there are no further discernable changes in morphology on the time scale of the simulation as confirmed in figure 4 .",
    "evidence that this droplet state is metastable is provided when the same simulation is run with a low viscosity .",
    "bulk fluid flow now allows the droplets to join to form lamellae and align .",
    "a surprising amount of movement is seen leading to the growth process shown in figure  [ figure3]c . in figure 4 the onset of hydrodynamic flow in this system",
    "is marked by a rather sharp increase in the measured length scale .",
    "the final state is coexistence between a lamellar and a bulk a - phase .",
    "the lamellae order in a distinctive spiral around the hole of a - phase , to minimise the elastic free energy which would be generated by incorrect lamellar spacings .",
    "finally we remark that very similar results were obtained for a concentration ratio of @xmath82 .",
    "finally we describe phase separation in a highly asymmetric binary fluid with @xmath83 . now",
    "the equilibrium for @xmath9 sufficiently negative comprises droplets of @xmath1 in @xmath0 . figure 5 compares results for two different values of @xmath9 :    * high viscosity , two - phase coexistence ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) * high viscosity , lamellar equilibrium ( @xmath67 , @xmath69 )    the main difference between the growth processes in figures 5a and 5b is a direct consequence of the final equilibrium state . for @xmath68 ,",
    "once the domains have formed they continue to grow slowly by the diffusion of material between them .",
    "this is the lifshitz - slyozov growth process , driven by the difference in chemical potential between droplets of different size . for @xmath69",
    "however there is a preferred size for droplets , set by the competition between the surface tension and the curvature energy , and growth stops once the droplets have reached this size .",
    "a second difference is that for the negative value of @xmath9 droplets form much more quickly in the early stages of growth .",
    "this is a consequence of the reduced surface tension",
    ".    runs for a low viscosity and negative @xmath9 showed a negligible influence of hydrodynamics on growth for this concentration .",
    "this is as expected .",
    "hydrodynamic flow can act to make a droplet circular because of the pressure difference between points of different curvature .",
    "however once the drops are circular hydrodynamic flow can not directly lead to droplet coalescence although it may speed up the diffusive growth@xcite .",
    "we have shown that there is a wealth of interesting behaviour as even rather simple structured fluids attain equilibrium .",
    "competition between diffusive and hydrodynamic modes lead to final states dependent on the dynamic parameters of the system .",
    "in particular we have emphasised that hydrodynamic flow is often important in allowing a system to reach its equilibrium state .",
    "the results were obtained using lattice boltzmann simulations .",
    "the approach has two particular advantages in this context .",
    "firstly equilibrium is determined by a free energy which is an intrinsic part of the simulation so the structure of the equilibrium state can be chosen rather naturally .",
    "secondly the viscosity of the fluid can be tuned over a wide range .",
    "we caution however that the lattice boltzmann evolution is not described by an h - theorem and thus no proof exisits that the path to equilibrium is a physical one .",
    "lattice boltzmann simulations do not intrinsically include noise although this can be added in an ad hoc way .",
    "an important question is whether such fluctuations can relax the disordered lamellar states .",
    "we ran simulations aimed at investigating this but found no effect of noise on the glassy structure .",
    "in real two - dimensional smectics fluctuations destroy the lamellar order .",
    "however , for this model we expect a stable lamellar phase , both because of the lack of fluctuations and because we impose a mean - field free energy .",
    "our conclusions are in broad agreement with those of bahiana and oono@xcite who considered the spinodal decomposition of a model of block copolymers designed to give a lamellar equilibrium . despite the long - range interactions in the model",
    "a tangled lamellar phase was formed after a quench .",
    "this could be ordered by including terms approximating hydrodynamic flow in the simulation .",
    "other related work@xcite uses a langevin approach which includes hydrodynamics to model phase separation in microemulsions .",
    "the domain growth slows as the surfactant density is increased .",
    "this method provides an alternative numerical way to study complex fluids and it would be interesting to gain a fuller understanding of the applicabilities of the different approaches .",
    "there are many questions that remain to be considered .",
    "these include the effect of confinement or shear on the phase separation , dynamical asymmetry in the viscosities of the two fluid components , and the rle of a very low diffusivity , which has been shown to alter the path to bulk phase separation in binary fluids@xcite .",
    "work is in progress to include a surfactant as a third phase rather than modelling its effect by changing the surface tension .",
    "extensions to three dimensions are highly desirable .",
    "these are feasible but at the limit of current numerical resources .",
