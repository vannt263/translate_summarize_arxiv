    "flexible and dissociative models for simulation of liquid water have often been used in classical statistical mechanical studies of aqueous materials .",
    "they present technical advantages for carrying - out simulations and are of - the - essence where dissociation of water molecules is necessary to the chemistry being studied .",
    "studies of clusters suggest that quantum mechanics plays a non - negligible role in proton transfer.@xcite however , directly incorporating quantum mechanics via discretized path integral approaches may require orders of magnitude larger computational effort than the classical problem .",
    "this report investigates constructing simple intramolecular wavefunctions for aqueous species .",
    "these wavefunctions might be used in monte carlo simulations of aqueous solutions with the same computational techniques used to treat flexible simulation models classically .",
    "more specifically , our goal is to determine the complication and accuracy to be expected in constructing wavefunctions that might be transferrable and useful in related studies of aqueous solution chemistry .",
    "we take the deuterated hydronium ion , d@xmath0o@xmath1 , as a specific example species .",
    "we choose this ion because of the substantial current interest in proton exchange processes in water and in the spectroscopy of charged clusters of water molecules ; we choose the deuterated case to avoid the interesting complications of spin restrictions on the wavefunctions .",
    "in addition we will study here only states of zero angular momentum , j=0 .",
    "our goal will be to obtain a simple intramolecular wavefunction for this species in a reasonably organized fashion .",
    "a traditional exhaustive expansion of the wavefunction into a basis will produce satisfactory vibrational energies with effort but does not produce a simple result for the wavefunction .",
    "less traditionally , diffusion monte carlo@xcite will produce satisfactory vibrational energies for low energy states with effort but not a simple wavefunction for other uses .",
    "in contrast , the historical work of mcmillan@xcite , a variational monte carlo calculation for the ground state of liquid he@xmath5 , does directly center on the construction of a simple wavefunction .",
    "the monte carlo character of this technique is limited to the primitive but essential task of evaluating integrals with a many - body wavefunction .",
    "this approach permits simple but sophisticated descriptions of correlation and can include a limited number of excited states .",
    "the possibility of simultaneous treatment of excited states provides an additional avenue for description of correlation .",
    "in fact , the density matrix monte carlo approach @xcite of recent years can be regarded as a generalization of the mcmillan calculation ; the @xmath6=0 circumstance is precisely the result that we view as the mcmillan calculation with excited states .",
    "the full power of the density matrix monte carlo approach can be used with rough initial estimates of the wavefunctions sought .",
    "the monte carlo calculation systematically improves the computed energy levels .",
    "however , since our goal is to derive a wavefunction useful in other contexts , we emphasize finding and utilizing the best simple function we can before the density matrix monte carlo procedure takes over .    we will initially use pair - product wavefuctions for atomic motion .",
    "the components of the pair - product are obtained by diagonalizing an approximate density matrix .",
    "we emphasize that initial model vibrational wavefunctions need not be orthonormal .",
    "it is found ( below ) that these initial pair - product wavefunctions capture two body correlations fairly well .",
    "using them as a basis in mcmillan and density matrix monte carlo calculations incorporates further correlation effects . to obtain more compact wavefunctions ,",
    "the variational principle is used to identify the important many - body correlations .",
    "these effects are included into the ground state wavefunction and yield a significantly improved simple wavefunction for the ground state .",
    "a few of these correlated wavefunctions can be used as the basis in a mcmillan calculation yielding reasonably accurate wavefunctions .",
    "we develop the vibrational wavefunctions analogously to development of wavefunctions for liquid he .",
    "we initially seek a pair product form @xmath7 in this case , we expect the functions @xmath8 to be local mode orbitals and the functions @xmath9 to serve as correlation functions .",
    "the casual interpretation of these functions as orbitals will serve to distinguish vibrational excitations .",
    "the method sketched here is based upon the observation that the eigenfunctions of the asymptotic @xmath10 density matrix are suitable initial estimates of the pair functions sought .",
    "this method has the additional advantage that harmonic analysis of a potentially rough energy landscape is not required .",
    "we start with a function of this simple form for several reasons .",
    "first , a similar distribution is implied when flexible and dissociative pair simulation models of water are treated classically .",
    "second , elements of such a form might be approximately transferrable to od and dd joint distributions in other settings - this would be the natural assumption for simulation calculations .",
    "third , such a form would be similar , though not the same as a ground state vibrational wavefunction for a harmonic system .",
    "the distinctions are that normal modes coordinates are not used , and that functions employed can attempt to treat anharmonic systems by deviating from gaussian form where the potential is anharmonic .",
    "the remainder of this paper characterizes such wavefunctions and investigates some improvements .",
    "the natural orbitals of a density matrix @xmath11 are introduced by @xmath12 in fact the asymptotic @xmath10 limit of the density matrix is simple:@xcite @xmath13 sethia _ et al . _ showed that though the density matrix used is approximate , satisfactory orbital functions are obtained.@xcite this form for the thermal density matrix is more than merely an approximation . for small @xmath6 , it is asymptotically correct . therefore , it is satisfactory if the application permits a small @xmath6 .",
    "the subsequent developments exploit this point .      for higher dimensional problems",
    ", we can exploit the approximate density matrix to produce the necessary reasonable pair functions after tracing - out all other degrees of freedom .",
    "this tracing - out will be generally possible on the basis of classical monte carlo techniques .",
    "consider a system composed of n particles located at @xmath14 .",
    "the n - body high - temperature thermal density matrix is @xmath15 we now focus on the \\{ij } pair of particles .",
    "for all other particles , we restrict the density matrix to the diagonal .",
    "for example , taking \\{ij}=\\{12 } we obtain @xmath16 now for the \\{12 } pair we transform to the \\{12 } center of mass and relative coordinates : @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    note that @xmath22 is not the molecular center of mass and that the potential generally does depend on @xmath22 .",
    "however , in the interest of simplicity and in view of the form sought eq .",
    "( [ pproduct ] ) , we will trace - out the @xmath22 dependence also . our final step will be to use classical monte carlo techniques for the integrations required to bring eq .",
    "( [ rdiagtrans ] ) into the form of eq.([norbs ] ) for the relative coordinate r. thus we sample configurations with the probability density @xmath23 and we estimate the kernel @xmath24 where @xmath25/m,\\left [ m_1{\\bf r}_1+m_2{\\bf r}_2 -m_1{\\bf r'}\\right]/m\\ldots{\\bf r}_n ) & - & v({\\bf r}_1,{\\bf r}_2\\ldots{\\bf r}_n)\\enspace . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath26 is symmetric . for the case considered here , it does not depend on the angles that * r * or * r*@xmath27 make with the laboratory fixed coordinate system .",

    "since we here focus on radial functions , we only need the kernel after having averaged over that polar angle .",

    "weight each configuration @xmath34 and the corresponding @xmath35 by @xmath36/m,\\left [ m_1{\\bf r}_1+m_2{\\bf r}_2 -m_1{\\bf r'}\\right]/m \\ldots { \\bf r}_n))/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] 3 .",

    ", we solve the one dimensional equation @xmath42 @xmath43 is not @xmath44 but is proportional to it .",
    "this approach is not limited to the circumstances that one member of that pair is a massive molecular center .",
    "this can be applied also for dd pairs in the d@xmath0o@xmath1 molecule . however , for the d@xmath0o@xmath1 molecule in particular , it is natural to regard the od functions as local mode orbitals and the dd functions as providing a subsequent account of correlations .",
    "the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are found for the second version of the ojamae - shavitt - singer ( oss ) potential@xcite using @xmath47=0.01 hartree and a sample size of 500,000 @xmath48 configurations .",
    "this energy parameter is 6.3 kcal / mole ( more than 3000 k ) , a value above the inversion barrier of 4.4 kcal / mole .",
    "smaller values for @xmath6 are problematical because of the fragmentation of the d@xmath0o@xmath46 molecule at high temperatures .",
    "figure  [ phidd ] shows @xmath9 obtained .",
    "the additional approximation of fixing one of the deuterons in the reference bond has the significant effect of narrowing the pair function .",
    "as expected , the effect is not as dramatic for fixing an oxygen atom .",
    "the co - linear assumption of fixing the orientation of the reference bond is not significant .",
    "these functions were also obtained for the stillinger , stillinger , hogdgon ( ssh ) potential.@xcite a comparison of features of ssh and oss is presented in table  [ comppot ] .",
    "the higher ( more realistic ) binding energy for the additional proton in the ssh case and the higher inversion barrier of this potential permits a smaller @xmath6 . in that case",

    "the numerical arrays describing the od and dd functions were fit to cubic splines with first derivatives set to zero at the end points@xcite and the pair product wavefunctions of eq .",
    "( [ pproduct ] ) were obtained .",
    "several steps were taken to assess the quality of these wavefunctions . for the oss and ssh potentials ,",
    "the variational monte carlo@xcite zero point energies of the pair product wavefunctions are 0.0321(2 ) and 0.0367(6 )  hartrees , respectively .",
    "simple diffusion monte carlo@xcite zero - point energies for the potentials are 0.02516(3 ) and 0.03042(3 )  hartrees .",
    "( all errors are two standard deviations unless otherwise noted . )",
    "the energy for the pair product function is between 20% and 30% too large .",
    "this function was further optimized by introducing parameters to move ( m ) and scale ( s ) the pair functions ; @xmath52 .",
    "no significant lowering of the energy was found .",
    "the quality of optimization of these pair functions can be analyzed directly .",
    "the usual variation principle can be expressed as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the usual local energy function and the subscripted brackets @xmath55 indicate an average with probability density @xmath56 . for a pair product wavefunction",
    "this form implies @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the @xmath59 pair joint density operator .",
    "this stationary requirement is satisfied for the exact ground state wavefunction since the local energy is spatially constant .",
    "deviation of the left side of eqn .",
    "[ variationalcondition ] from zero will be defined as optimization deficit .",
    "figure  [ errordd ] shows the optimization deficit for the oss dd pair functions and the dd vmc radial distribution function .",
    "the od functions show similar low optimization deficits ; these pair functions lead to accurately uncorrelated pair densities and local energies and are thus well optimized .",
    "note that the largest deficits are at the tails of the distribution .",
    "thus further optimization would require significant effort because of the difficulty of getting statistically significant data for those infrequent events .",
    "we can use model excited state functions to improve the ground state and get a few low lying states at the same time .",
    "a concise expression of these approaches is obtained by focusing on the density matrix .",

    ", we estimate the matrix elements @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath6 not too large . as @xmath6 gets large , information is lost for highly excited states , so this approach depends on location of an intermediate range of @xmath6 . @xmath63 and @xmath64 are then diagonalized simultaneously .",
    "the @xmath65 need not be orthonormal initially since monte carlo methods will be used to perform the required integrations .",

    "an ordered set of excited state functions is constructed .",

    "inclusion of a small number of excited states substantially improves the predicted zero - point energy ; the 20 - 30% error with the pair product wavefunction is reduced to about a 10% error with inclusion of nine states .",
    "however , the improvement of this prediction with increasing numbers of excited states is slow .",
    "as shown in tables  [ osscfmctau=0 ] and  [ sshcfmctau=0 ] , inclusion of 94 and 99 states still results in a 4 - 6% error .",

    "( see figure  [ ossground9 ] ) tables  [ osscfmctauplateau ] and  [ sshcfmctauplateau ] show the energy estimates for lowest 5 symmetric states for oss and ssh respectively .",
    "the average energies and their standard deviations as a function of @xmath6 were used in a marquardt s fit to the function @xmath81 .",
    "error bars were obtained by dividing the configurations used to calculate the matrices into smaller sets , diagonalizing these sets , obtaining the standard deviation for their eigenvalues , and dividing it by the square root of the number of sets .",
