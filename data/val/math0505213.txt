    "determinants play an important role in many areas of mathematics .",
    "often , the solution of a particular problem in combinatorics , mathematical physics or , simply , linear algebra , depends on the explicit computation of a determinant .",
    "some useful and efficient tools for evaluating determinants are provided in krattenthaler s survey articles @xcite , @xcite , which also contain many explicit determinant evaluations that have appeared in the literature and give references where further such formulae can be found .    as examples of interesting determinant evaluations , we mention the weyl denominator formulas for classical root systems , which play a fundamental role in lie theory and related areas",
    ". in general , the weyl denominator formula for a reduced root system reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the weyl group , @xmath2 the set of positive roots and @xmath3 . for the classical root systems",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , this identity takes the explicit form    [ wd ] @xmath8    respectively .    in this article , we are interested in generalizing to the level of _ elliptic determinant evaluations_. by this we mean that the matrix elements should be defined in terms of theta functions , so that it is _ a priori _ clear that the quotient of the two sides of the identity is an elliptic function of some natural parameters .",
    "up to date , according to our knowledge , very few elliptic determinant ( and pfaffian ) evaluations are known , see @xcite , @xcite , ( * ? ? ? *",

    "* th .  4.17 , lem .",
    "most of these results contain elliptic extensions of weyl denominators , and are thus apparently related to root systems .",
    "an elliptic extension of the weyl denominator formula was obtained by macdonald @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "he introduced , and completely classified , _ affine root systems_. moreover , he extended the weyl denominator formula to the case of _ reduced _ affine root systems . in this",
    "setting , both the root system and the weyl group are infinite , so the resulting _ macdonald identities _ equate an infinite series and an infinite product .",
    "the precise statement is more complicated than , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "8.1 ) and , for the special cases of interest to us , corollary [ mlc ] below .",
    "the macdonald identities can be interpreted in terms of kac  moody algebras @xcite .",
    "notable special cases include watson s quintuple product identity @xcite ( for the affine root system @xmath9 ) , winquist s identity @xcite ( for @xmath10 ) and the so called septuple product identity @xcite ( put @xmath11 in the @xmath12 case of proposition [ mdp ] below ) .",
    "there are seven infinite families of irreducible reduced affine root systems and seven exceptional cases",
    ". we will only consider the infinite families , which macdonald denotes @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "they should not be confused with the classical root systems mentioned above .",
    "( for instance , the classical root system @xmath20 is non - reduced whereas the affine root system @xmath20 is reduced . )",
    "although the corresponding macdonald identities do give elliptic extensions of , it is only for type @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 that they can immediately be written as determinant evaluations .",
    "nevertheless , one of our goals is to rewrite all seven cases in determinant form , and prove them by an `` identification of factors '' argument similar to the usual proof of the vandermonde determinant .",
    "this new proof of the macdonald identities is rather similar to stanton s elementary proof @xcite , but the use of determinants makes the details more streamlined .    for each affine root system @xmath21 under consideration , we define a corresponding notion of @xmath21 theta function .",
    "we then give a `` master determinant formula '' , proposition  [ wp ] , which expresses a determinant of @xmath21 theta functions as a constant times the @xmath21 macdonald denominator .",
    "when the constant can be explicitly determined , we have a genuine determinant evaluation .",
    "such explicit instances of the master formula include a determinant of warnaar ( proposition [ bcdet ] below ) , new generalized weyl denominator formulas for all seven families of reduced affine root systems ( theorem  [ adet ] , theorem  [ cdet ] and corollaries [ bcdet2 ] to [ ddet ] ) and determinant versions of the macdonald identities ( proposition  [ mdp ] ) .",
    "theorem [ adet ] include as special cases the determinants of frobenius and hasegawa cited above , and has a non - trivial overlap with the determinant of tarasov and varchenko .",
    "the most striking difference between our new elliptic denominator formulas and those found by macdonald is the large number of free parameters in our identities .",
    "this probably makes the results more difficult to interpret in terms of , say , affine lie algebras . on the other hand",
    ", the presence of free parameters seems useful for certain applications .",
    "indeed , special cases of our identities have found applications to _ multidimensional basic and elliptic hypergeometric series and integrals _ , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , to the study of _ ruijsenaars operators _ and related integrable systems @xcite , @xcite , to _ combinatorics _ , see @xcite for an extensive list of references , as well as to _ number theory _",
    "it thus seems very likely that our new results will find similar applications .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ secpre ] contains preliminaries on jacobi theta functions . in section  [ sectrs ]",
    "we introduce theta functions associated to the seven families of reduced affine root systems .",
    "we then give our master formula , proposition  [ wp ] .",
    "in section  [ secell ] we obtain several elliptic determinant evaluations that can be viewed as explicit versions of proposition [ wp ] .",
    "the main results are theorems  [ adet ] and  [ cdet ] ( the other determinant evaluations are corollaries of these ) .",
    "section  [ secrat ] features several corollaries obtained by restricting to the _ polynomial _ special case .",
    "finally , in section  [ secmac ] , we obtain determinant evaluations that are shown to be equivalent to the macdonald identities for non - exceptional reduced affine root systems .",
    "we thank eric rains for his comments on corollary [ lem ] , leading to some improvements in that part of the paper , and vitaly tarasov for clarifying how to obtain corollary [ tvcor ] from the results of @xcite , see remark [ tvrem ] .",
    "throughout this paper , we implicitly assume that all scalars are generic , so that no denominators in our identities vanish .",
    "the letter @xmath22 will denote a fixed number such that @xmath23 .",
    "when dealing with the root system @xmath24 , we will also assume a fixed choice of square root @xmath25 .",
    "the case @xmath26 will be considered in section [ secrat ] .",
    "we use the standard notation @xmath27 @xmath28 then , @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes a primitive @xmath31th root of unity .",
    "we employ `` multiplicative '' , rather than `` additive '' , notation for theta functions .",
    "this corresponds to realizing the torus @xmath32 as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we take as our building block the function @xmath35 we will sometimes use the shorthand notation @xmath36",

    "the macdonald identities involve the macdonald denominator @xmath51 where @xmath2 is the positive part of a reduced affine root system and @xmath52 a formal exponential .",
    "although we will not need anything of macdonald s theory , it may be instructive to explain what means in the case @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 , @xmath55 , be a basis for @xmath56 , and write @xmath57 for the affine function @xmath58 .",
    "then , affine @xmath6 consists of the roots @xmath59 @xmath60 the positive roots are @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 thus , the macdonald denominator for @xmath6 is @xmath65 introducing variables @xmath22 and @xmath66 by @xmath67 , @xmath68 , takes the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath6 macdonald identity gives the explicit multiple laurent expansion of this function , where @xmath71 are viewed as non - zero complex variables and @xmath22 as a constant with @xmath72 .",
    "more generally , the macdonald denominators for the seven families of reduced affine root systems equal , up to a trivial factor that has been chosen for convenience , @xmath73 we will use the above list as a rule for labelling our results .",
    "each of our elliptic determinant evaluations expresses the macdonald denominator of some affine root system as a determinant .",
    "the following definition may seem strange , since root systems are usually associated to multivariable functions .",
    "however , it will enable us to give a very succinct statement of proposition [ wp ] . note that , except in the case @xmath74 , @xmath75 is an @xmath21 theta function of each @xmath71 .",
