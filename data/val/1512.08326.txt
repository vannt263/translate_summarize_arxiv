    "while average pulse shapes do vary with frequency @xcite , the pulse shapes of radio pulsars , including those objects having two or more stable shapes associated with metastable state of the magnetosphere ( i.e. , the shapes do not show evolution in time ) , are stable and show no secular evolution except for a few pulsars in ns - ns binaries where geodetic precession alters the orientation of the beam @xcite and in the crab pulsar in which larges changes in pulse shape are seen over a few decades @xcite .",
