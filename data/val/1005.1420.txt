    "a constant uniform _ magnetic _ field configuration in an inertial frame of reference has cylindrical symmetry ; therefore , the motion of a test charge in this field is such that the particle s momentum and angular momentum in the direction of the field are constants of the motion .",
    "the particle in general moves with constant speed on a helix whose axis is along the field direction ; moreover , the radius and step of the helical path are constants as well .",
    "the sense of helical motion about the direction of the magnetic field is positive ( negative ) for a test particle of negative ( positive ) electric charge .",
    "if the initial velocity of the particle is normal to the direction of the magnetic field , then the particle simply moves along a circle in the plane perpendicular to the field .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the analogous situation for the motion of free test particles in a _",
    "gravitomagnetic _ field .",
    "the nonlinearity of this field implies that only a rough similarity may be anticipated .",
    "we investigate geodesic motion in a rotating dynamic spacetime region that is a ricci - flat solution of einstein s equations with cylindrical symmetry  @xcite .",
    "though this time - dependent gravitational case is considerably more complicated than the magnetic case , we find qualitatively similar phenomena .",
    "in fact , the helical motions up and down parallel to the axis of symmetry are reminiscent of the double - jet structure of certain high - energy astrophysical sources .",
    "quasars and active galactic nuclei generally exhibit distinct relativistic outflows .",
    "these jets are conjectured to originate from massive rotating black holes surrounded by accretion disks ; the outflows are focused beams of relativistic particles that proceed up and down along the rotation axis of the black hole ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) .",
    "similar phenomena have been observed in other high - energy astrophysical sources such as the galactic x - ray binary systems . while our results suggest a mechanism for astrophysical jet formation , the more complicated physical process involves general relativistic mhd  @xcite . the present work ",
    "together with previous efforts  @xcite  contributes to the purely gravitational aspects of this fundamental problem in astrophysics .    for a subclass of the ricci - flat solutions under consideration ,",
    "we show that the geodesic equations have families of special exact solutions that we call gravitomagnetic jets .",
    "more precisely , a gravitomagnetic jet is a set of special geodesics .",
    "these generally exhibit helical motions about the axis of cylindrical symmetry and their union is a non - compact connected invariant manifold that attracts all nearby geodesics .",
    "while we highlight features of these jets in the source - free cylindrical spacetime region of interest and provide strong ( numerical ) evidence that these families are attractors , the interesting question of the nature of the external matter currents that could generate such a gravitational field remains beyond the scope of our present investigation .",
    "according to general relativity , a rotating mass generates a relativistic , and hence non - newtonian , gravitomagnetic field that is due to mass current .",
    "the exterior gravitomagnetic field of the earth has recently been _ directly _ measured via gravity probe b ( gp - b )  @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "solutions of einstein s equations in the case of axial symmetry have received attention for a long time ( see ch .",

    "previous interesting work on exact cylindrically symmetric gravitational fields in connection with the origin and structure of astrophysical jets has mainly involved the study of geodesics in the interior of time - independent rigidly rotating dust cylinders  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of free test particles in this case is directly influenced by the gravitational attraction of the rotating dust particles ; to avoid this circumstance , we concentrate here on certain source - free gravitational fields that happen to depend exponentially upon time .",
    "these ricci - flat fields are perhaps more representative of the strongly time - dependent near - zone exteriors of accreting and growing gravitationally collapsed configurations where astrophysical jets are expected to originate .",
    "the temporal variation of the gravitational fields considered in our work leads to a significant and surprising feature of the special exact solutions of the geodesic equations .",
    "the speeds of test particles in gravitomagnetic jets start from values that are always above a certain minimum speed , rapidly increase along their paths and asymptotically approach the speed of light .",
    "the minimum speed represents the speed of circular motion perpendicular to the axis of rotation .",
    "the range of this minimum speed turns out to be from zero up to about @xmath0 .",
    "is the main general relativistic problem of high - energy astrophysical jets solved in our paper ?",
    "our gravitational model is certainly too elementary to be an adequate representation of the complex physical situation .",
    "nevertheless , in our simple model free test particles appear to be exponentially accelerated to almost the speed of light resulting in ultrarelativistic jet streams parallel and antiparallel to the axis of rotation .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the class of spacetime metrics that we study in this paper is described in section ii .",
    "each metric in this class involves a function @xmath1 that is a solution of an ordinary differential equation and must be so chosen as to render our system of cylindrical coordinates admissible in the spacetime region of interest .",
    "the procedure for the determination of an appropriate @xmath1 is described in section iii .",
    "the rotational aspects of the resulting gravitational field are discussed in section iv .",
    "section v treats the motion of free test particles and null rays in the spacetime region of interest .",
    "this section also contains a discussion of the special analytic solutions of the geodesic equations that form gravitomagnetic jets . numerical evidence that gravitomagnetic jets are indeed attractors is presented in section vi .",
    "section vii contains a discussion of our results . for clarity of presentation , some of the detailed calculations and mathematical arguments",
    "are relegated to the appendices .",

    "the proofs of the main mathematical results regarding the solutions of a certain highly nonlinear ordinary differential equation are given in appendix  [ appen : b ] , where , due to the nature of the subject matter , some of the notation employed is independent of the rest of the paper .",
    "appendix  [ appen : c ] treats the geodesics of the time - reversed metric .",
    "in a study devoted to gravitational radiation  @xcite , a solution of the source - free gravitational field equations was described and partially interpreted using rotating cylindrical gravitational waves .",

    "we transform it to the lotka - volterra system   in appendix  [ appen : b ] .",
    "we do not know an explicit general solution of eq .  .",
    "for the only explicit solutions known to exist , we note that @xmath17 constant is unacceptable as the 4d metric   would then degenerate into a 3d spacetime , and the solutions @xmath18 correspond to the special free rotating gravitational waves investigated in detail in  @xcite and the references cited therein .",

    "the corresponding two - parameter isometry group is not orthogonally transitive .",
    "the invariant magnitude of the hypersurface - orthogonal @xmath44 is given by @xmath46 , while for @xmath45 , which is not hypersurface - orthogonal , the invariant magnitude is @xmath47 .",

    "thus , the gravitational potentials must be sufficiently smooth functions of these coordinates ; moreover , the lichnerowicz admissibility conditions  @xcite require that the _ principal minors _ of the metric tensor and its inverse be negative for our choice of metric signature .",

    "the character of metric tensor   depends on the choice of a solution of the differential eq .  .",

    "it is then possible to reduce the second - order eq .   to equations of first order  see appendix  [ appen : b ] .",
    "indeed , consideration of scale - invariant quantities leads to substantial simplifications in our work .",
    "the admissible class that we seek is a scale - invariant subclass of solutions of eq .   that are all of the form depicted for two cases in the top panel of figure 1 .",
    "in fact , in appendix  [ appen : b ] we prove that there is an open set of initial conditions that corresponds to admissible solutions each of which exists on an interval @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , with limiting values @xmath84 and @xmath85 such that @xmath86 at @xmath87 , the function @xmath20 is increasing , @xmath88 is decreasing and @xmath20 approaches infinity as @xmath21 approaches infinity .",
    "in addition , we show that there is an open set of initial conditions for solutions defined on @xmath82 with the same end - point asymptotics such that the scale - invariant function @xmath89 defined by @xmath90 has a zero @xmath91 in the interior of the interval of existence @xmath82 .",
    "the physical significance of this property is that it is the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of jets ; that is , if @xmath89 has such a zero , then the ( timelike and null ) geodesic equations admit special helical solutions propagating upward and downward on an interior cylinder of radius @xmath91 .",
    "these special solutions form gravitomagnetic jets .",
    "we also show that there is an open set of initial data corresponding to solutions that satisfy both conditions .    to clarify the connection of the present work with the solutions treated in ref .",

    "the present paper is therefore devoted to the study of solutions in the fourth quadrant for which @xmath100 and hence @xmath101 .",
