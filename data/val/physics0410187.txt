    "the laser photodetachment ( lpd ) technique combined with an electrostatic probe has been widely applied to the measurements of negative ion density and the drift velocity @xcite . in this measurement ,",
    "the excess electrons , produced by the laser - induced photodetachment process , @xmath0 , are detected by a positively biased electrostatic probe .",
    "then , we can determine the negative ion density @xmath1 and the drift velocity @xmath2 on the basis of the peak value of the excess electron current @xmath3 and of the temporal evolution of the electron current response , respectively .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out that negative ions play an important role in the divertor region for experimental fusion reactors .",
    "the negative ions are expected to contribute to the enhancement of recombination processes , which are capable of reducing the heat flux to the divertor plate @xcite .",
    "authors have been applied lpd technique to divertor simulator map ( material and plasma ) -ii for the purpose of clarifying the contribution of negative ions to the plasma recombination @xcite . up to now , however , the applicability of the laser photodetachment technique under the existence of magnetic field has not been examined . in particular , _ in situ _ measurement of not only the sheath around an electrostatic probe but also of the collection region of photodetached electrons ( pde ) stretches to the outside of the sheath is desirable for this purpose . in the present paper ,",
    "the developed new measurements of electron sheath thickness and the length of the collection region of pde are presented .",
    "the recovery time of lpd signal @xmath4 , in which the electron density at the center of the laser beam recovers to the initial density , is expressed using the drift velocity of negative ions @xmath2 and the radius of laser beam @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the recovery time of the lpd signal is expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents the radius of the cylindrical probe tip and @xmath8 the thickness of the electron sheath . because the sheath thickness is negligible at the space potential , the recovery time at the space potential @xmath9 is deduced by substituting @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 - 2 ] ) , as follows : @xmath11 thus , the sheath thickness is obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 - 2 ] ) and ( [ tr_modif ] ) , as @xmath12    next , let us consider the case that a screening object is inserted in the laser beam channel .",
    "originally , the screening object is used to avoid the probe surface ablation @xcite by shielding the probe tip from the direct laser irradiation @xcite .",
    "we named this screening method `` eclipse laser photodetachment method '' after a lunar eclipse , in which the shadow of the earth protects the moon from irradiation by the sun .",
    "it was confirmed that this eclipse - lpd method provides the proper negative ion density when the screening object is sufficiently smaller than the laser size @xcite .",
    "a schematic view of the experimental arrangement of the eclipse - lpd is depicted in fig . [",
    "fig : eclipse ] ( a ) .",
    "a thin wire was inserted in the laser beam channel to form a thin shadow in the laser channel .",
    "the position of the shadow was changed with a micrometer of the wire stage .",
    "note that the width of the shadow becomes a little wider than the screening object because of the diffraction of the laser beam .",
    "taking into consideration the distance from the wire to the probe tip ( @xmath130.5 m ) and the wavelength of the laser ( 532 nm ) , the calculation based on the fresnel diffraction provides the effective shadow width @xmath14 of the wire diameter plus 0.6 mm @xcite .",
    "typical temporal evolution of the conventional lpd signal and that of the eclipse - lpd are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : signals ] .",
    "we have checked that the recovery time is not disturbed by the screening object when the shadow width is sufficiently thinner than the laser diameter .",
    "thus the sheath effects can be observed in both eclipse - lpd signals and in conventional lpd signals as the shift of the recovery time .    on the other hand ,",
    "the time for the lpd signal to reach its peak value depends on the displacement between the effective probe surface including the sheath and the edge of the photodetached electron _ swarm_. the configuration of the laser beam and probe tip in eclipse - lpd",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eclipse ] ( b ) . when the probe is located outside the laser - irradiated area as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eclipse ] ( b ) , the peak time of the signal @xmath15 is shifted from @xmath16 by @xmath17 . because the propagation velocity of the excess electron _ swarm _ toward the outside of the laser irradiated region corresponds to the negative ion drift velocity @xcite ,",
    "the time shift due to the propagation can be expressed according to fig .",
    "[ fig : eclipse ] ( b ) as @xmath18 where @xmath14 is the shadow width and the term @xmath19 represents the probe radius corrected by the sheath thickness .",
    "the shift of the peak time at the space potential @xmath20 can be also deduced by substituting @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ ptim_modif ] ) as @xmath21 finally , the electron sheath thickness is deduced from the difference between eqs .",

    "moreover , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 - 2 ] ) and ( [ ptim_modif ] ) , the sheath thickness is obtained as @xmath23 therefore , in the eclipse - lpd method , we can obtain the sheath thickness @xmath8 in three independent ways .",

    "( [ sheath1 ] ) or of eqs .",
    "( [ sheath2 ] ) and ( [ tr_modif ] ) requires two signals at different bias voltages , space potential , and positive bias .",

    "the intensity of the lpd signal is sensitive to the dimension of the collection region of pde . in the eclipse - lpd method ,",
    "the signal intensity decreases when part of the collection region is shaded by the shadow .",
    "however , the signal intensity recovers when the shadow is well aligned with the electrostatic probe .",
    "this phenomena can be explained by the excess electrons leaked from the irradiated region to the shaded region @xcite .",
    "the width of the total signal dip is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the length of the collection region of pde .",
    "we can thus obtain @xmath25 .",

    "the probe was located at the peripheral region of the plasma column , where the negative ion density ratio to the electron density is about several percent @xcite .",
    "the negative ion density ratio was so small that we neglected the modification of the sheath structure due to the photodetachment process .",
    "second harmonic nd : yag laser pulses ( the wavelength of @xmath35532 nm ) were used for the photon source of the photodetachment .",
    "a thin wire for the eclipse - lpd is located outside the vacuum chamber .",
    "the distance from the wire to the probe tip was about 0.5 m and the shadow position was adjusted with a micrometer of the wire stage . in the case of 15 mt ,",
    "the larmor radius of the electrons is comparable to the size of the probe . in order to examine the effect of the magnetic field , the case without the magnetic field",
    "was compared with the case at 15 mt . in reality , a weak magnetic field of less than 1 mt exists even when the coil currents at the target chamber are turned off . however ,",
