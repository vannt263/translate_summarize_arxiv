    "string theory @xcite remains to be the leading candidate to incorporate gravity into a unified quantum framework of the elementary particle interactions .",
    "the string scale ( @xmath8 ) is naturally close to the quantum gravity scale @xmath9 gev , or to a grand unification ( gut ) scale @xmath10 gev @xcite .",
    "it has been argued recently that the fundamental string scale can be much lower @xcite . with the existence of large effective volume of extra dimensions beyond four , the fundamental quantum gravity scale may be as low as a tev .",
    "this is thought to have provided an alternative approach to the hierarchy problem @xcite , namely the large gap between the electroweak scale @xmath11(100 gev ) and the planck scale of @xmath12 .",
    "what is extremely interesting is that these scenarios would lead to very rich phenomenology at low energies in particle physics @xcite and astroparticle physics @xcite that may be observable in the next generation of experiments .",
    "one generic feature of string models is the appearance of string resonances ( sr ) in scattering of particles in the energy region above the string scale .",
    "the scattering amplitudes are of the form of the veneziano amplitudes @xcite , which may develop simple poles . in the @xmath13-channel , the poles occur at @xmath14 with degeneracy for different angular momentum states .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the scattering involving gravitons ( closed strings ) is perturbatively suppressed by higher power of string coupling with respect to the open - string scatterings which therefore are the dominant phenomena at energies near and above the string scale .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the possibility of producing the string resonances of a tev - scale mass and studying their properties at colliders .",
    "we adopt the simplest open - string model in the d - brane scenario @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that all standard model ( sm ) particles are identified as open strings confined to a d3-brane universe , while a graviton is a closed string propagating freely in the bulk . for a given string realization of the sm",
    ", one should be able to calculate the open - string scattering amplitudes , in particular the chan - paton factors @xcite that are determined by the group structure of the particle representations and their interactions .",
    "unfortunately , there is no fully satisfactory construction of the sm from string theory and we are thus led to parameterize our ignorance .",
    "we demand that our stringy amplitudes reproduce the sm amplitudes at low energies .",
    "the zero - modes of the scattering amplitudes are all identified as the massless sm particles and no new exotic states of the zero - modes are present . by taking chan - paton factors to be free parameters ,",
    "a non - trivial stringy extension of the sm amplitudes to a higher energy region is accomplished by a unique matching between stringy amplitudes and those of the sm at low energies .",
    "in fact , this scheme has been exploited in some earlier works .",
    "these include possible low - energy effects from the string amplitudes on four - fermion interactions @xcite , and searching for signals in cosmic neutrino interactions @xcite . in this paper , we explore the search and detailed study of their properties for these string resonances at hadron colliders such as the fermilab tevatron and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . in the string models ,",
    "we expect a series of resonances with a predicted mass relation @xmath15 . moreover , the angular distributions of the sr signals in parton - parton c.m .  frame present distinctive shapes in dileptonic and diphotonic channels due to the angular momentum decomposition .",
    "rather small forward - backward asymmetry is another feature of the model .",
    "these are all very unique and remarkably specific in contrast to signals from other sources of new physics .",
    "it is found that the lhc experiments may be sensitive to a string scale of @xmath16 tev .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first construct tree - level open - string scattering amplitudes for the dileptonic and diphotonic production processes in sec .",
    "[ ampl ] , which reproduce the sm amplitudes at low energies and extend to include string resonances . in sec .",
    "[ pwe ] , string resonance approximation is discussed and each string resonance is expanded into partial waves to see their angular momentum states . using the @xmath0 constraints at the tevatron , lower bounds on the string scale",
    "are obtained in sec .",
    "the analysis at the lhc is carried out in sec .  v. we summarize in sec .",
    "vi our results and emphasize the generic features and profound implications of the amplitude construction .",
    "the complete expressions for the scattering amplitudes and the decay widths are given in two appendices .",
    "the 4-point tree - level open - string amplitudes can be expressed generically @xcite @xmath17 where ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) represents external massless particles with incoming momenta .",
    "@xmath18 are kinematic parts for @xmath19 amplitudes @xcite , which are given in appendix a. the mandelstam variables at parton level are denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for physical process ( @xmath22 )",
    ", the @xmath20 and @xmath21-channels are labeled by ( 1,2 ) , ( 1,4 ) and ( 1,3 ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath23 are the chan - paton factors and in the usual construction , @xmath24 following ref .",
    "@xcite , we adopt the normalization of @xmath25 .",
    "since a complete string model construction for the electroweak interaction of the standard model is unavailable , we will assume that these chan - paton factors are free parameters and @xmath23 is typically in range of @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is essentially the veneziano amplitude @xmath29 where the regge slope @xmath30 , and the amplitude approaches unity as either @xmath31 or @xmath32 .    of special interests for this article",
    "are the @xmath33 processes that may lead to clear experimental signatures at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "we thus concentrate on two clean channels : the drell - yan ( dy ) dilepton production ( @xmath34 ) and the diphoton production ( @xmath35 ) , from @xmath36 annihilation and possibly gluon - gluon fusion . in this section ,",
    "we explicitly construct the string amplitudes for these production processes .      at hadron colliders ,",
    "the @xmath37 dilepton production processes are @xmath38 .",
    "the tree - level process for @xmath39 is absent in the sm . in the massless limit of the fermions",
    ", we label their helicities by the chirality @xmath40 . for the process with initial state @xmath41 , we have two cases depending on the helicity combination of the final state leptons .",
    "the non - vanishing amplitudes are those for @xmath42 .",
    "the external particle ordering is ( @xmath22 ) .    with the notation as in appendix",
    "a , this process belongs to a type of @xmath43 , with @xmath44 denoting the helicity of the particle with respect to incoming momentum .",
    "our construction thus leads to the physical amplitude @xmath45 .",
    "\\label{eq:2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding standard model amplitude is via the electroweak interaction , @xmath46 where the photon and @xmath47 contributions are given by @xmath48 here @xmath49 and the @xmath50 coupling @xmath51 .",
    "the neutral current couplings are @xmath52 .",
    "the crucial assumption for our approach is to demand the string expression eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) to reproduce the standard model amplitude in the low - energy limit when @xmath53 .",
    "this can be achieved by identifying the string coupling with the gauge coupling @xmath54 , and matching the chan - paton factors @xmath23 as @xmath55 we then obtain the full result @xmath56 for simplicity , we will take the chan - paton parameter @xmath57 to be positive and @xmath58 .",
    "taking @xmath57 to be negative will not change our numerical results appreciably .    a few interesting features",
    "are worthwhile commenting .",
    "first , we see that the string amplitude eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) consists of two terms : one proportional to the sm result multiplied by a veneziano amplitude @xmath28 ; the other purely with string origin proportional to an unknown chan - paton parameter @xmath57 . in the low - energy limit @xmath59 , @xmath60 , reproducing the sm result regardless of @xmath57 .",
    "this implies that @xmath57 can not be determined unless one specifies the detailed embedding of the sm to some more generalized group structure in a string setup .",
    "the seemingly disturbing fact is that one of the chan - paton factors @xmath61 must be made dependent upon the @xmath47-pole , rather than pure gauge couplings .",
    "this reflects our ignorance of treating the electroweak symmetry breaking in our approach .    as for the other helicity combination @xmath62",
    ", it belongs to the class of @xmath63 .",
    "we apply the same methods as stated above and find the crossing relation @xmath64 and an index interchange in the @xmath65 factor , @xmath66 with @xmath67 .    in our open - string model",
    ", there is the possibility of dilepton production via two initial state gluons .",
    "this amplitude vanishes at tree - level in the standard model , but could be non - zero in the open - string model if the gluons and leptons belong to some larger gauge group in which the chan - paton trace is non - vanishing .",
    "the amplitude belongs to a type of @xmath68 according to appendix a. with @xmath69 , the result reads @xmath70 where @xmath57 may be different for each helicity combination of external particles .",
    "in fact , there exists an intrinsic ambiguity for the string coupling identification since there are both strong interaction and electroweak interaction involved simultaneously .",
    "coupling identification for this subprocess would not be determined without an explicit string model construction .",
    "this problem is beyond the scope of this article . to be conservative",
    ", we have identified the string coupling with the weak coupling @xmath71 .    for @xmath72",
    ", we have @xmath64 of the above expression .      another clean signal in addition to dilepton production at hadron colliders is the diphoton final state .",
    "we therefore construct the string amplitudes for diphoton processes in this section .",
    "we again label the helicities by @xmath73 , and as in the dileptonic processses , the non - vanishing amplitudes are those with @xmath74 .    using the kinematic amplitudes for fermions and gauge bosons @xmath75 as given in appendix a and the matching techniques between the string and sm amplitudes described in the previous section , we obtain the following open - string amplitudes for @xmath76 , @xmath77 which correctly reproduce sm amplitudes at low energies , given by the first term . for the other helicity combination @xmath78",
    ", the amplitude can be obtained by @xmath64 .    identifying this process with @xmath79 ,",
    "one has @xmath80 with @xmath69 .",
    "note that this amplitude is of purely stringy origin .",
    "there exists the same ambiguity for the string coupling identification as in @xmath81 . to be conservative ,",
    "we have matched the string coupling with the electromagnetic interactions .",
    "for the other helicity combination @xmath78 , the amplitude can be obtained by @xmath64 .",
    "the factor @xmath82 in the veneziano amplitude develops simple poles at @xmath83 , implying resonant states with masses @xmath84 . at energies near the string scale ,",
    "string resonances thus become dominating .",
    "one can perform a resonant expansion , @xmath85 thus , by neglecting @xmath86 which does not contain @xmath13-channel poles , @xmath87 it is a remarkable result that this purely stringy function @xmath88 has only odd-@xmath89 srs due to the crossing symmetry between @xmath90 and @xmath21 .",
    "it represents the stringy effects of spin - excitations along the string worldsheet , which are suppressed at low energy .",
    "these are the generic features of stringy effects we wish to explore at the high energy experiments .",
    "the open - string amplitude construction for drell - yan processes predicts the existence of exotic intermediate states such as leptoquarks in the @xmath21-channel and higher spin bosonic excitations in the @xmath13-channel as string resonances . due to the limited c.m .",
    "energy accessible at collider experiments , we need to keep only the first few resonances . applying the general results of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:7.1 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) to the dilepton string amplitudes , we obtain the amplitude formula for the first two resonances , with @xmath91 defined as angle between initial quark and final anti - lepton in the parton c.m .",
    "frame , @xmath92\\quad & { \\rm for}\\ \\ell_\\alpha\\bar{\\ell}_\\beta \\\\   \\\\",
    "ig_l^2\\frac{(1+\\cos{\\theta})^2}{4 } \\left [ \\frac{s } { s - m^2_s } ( f_{\\beta\\alpha}+2 t )   - \\frac{s}{s-2m^2_s}f_{\\beta\\alpha } \\cos{\\theta } \\right ] & { \\rm for}\\ \\ell_\\beta\\bar{\\ell}_\\alpha",
    ".   \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the full amplitude then will appear as a sum @xmath93    a few remarks on the amplitudes are in order .",
    "firstly , even we set free chan - paton parameter @xmath57 to zero , there are still contributions from string resonances .",
    "this can be seen from the veneziano factor multiplying to the sm term in the string formula .",
    "significant differences from the standard model cross sections can be expected if the string scale is accessible at future colliders .",
    "second , the amplitude for the first ( odd-@xmath89 ) string resonance depends on the chan - paton parameter @xmath57 , while the second ( even-@xmath89 ) resonance does not .",
    "the even resonances are completely determined by the gauge factors @xmath65 in the standard model .    in the string model , there is a possible contribution from gluon fusion to lepton pairs , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) . near the string resonance",
    ", we have @xmath94 where the sign @xmath95 corresponds to @xmath96 , and @xmath97 to @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "there are only odd-@xmath89 string resonances from this gluon contribution .",
    "this is generic for any processes if the standard model amplitude vanishes at tree - level .",
    "it is always proportional to the function @xmath88 which vanishes in the low energy limit , which only has odd-@xmath89 resonances . as a comparison , for processes with the non - vanishing amplitudes in standard model at tree - level",
    ", their open - string amplitude will most likely contain both odd- and even-@xmath89 srs .",
    "the only exception is when the stringy correction piece multiplying to the standard model amplitude is @xmath86 which does not contain sr pole in the @xmath13-channel .",
    "this occurs naturally when the zero - mode ( sm ) tree - level exchange is in @xmath90 or @xmath21 but not in the @xmath13 channel .",
    "we can see from the list in appendix a that @xmath100 , to be multiplied with @xmath86 in the full amplitude expression , never contain @xmath13-channel pole .",
    "this is consistent with the physical picture that sr is the spin excitations of the zero - mode intermediate state . if the zero - mode ( sm ) intermediate state does not exist , then there will not exist sr interacting with the same gauge charges .",
    "an example of this kind of processes is @xmath101 which we can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) . for diphoton production , there are thus only odd-@xmath89 string resonances .",
    "the first sr ( @xmath102 ) for both processes are @xmath103 the expressions for opposite helicity combinations @xmath104 are given by @xmath105 .",
    "observe that sr coupling is proportional to @xmath57 which is completely undetermined .",
    "we will include these @xmath102 resonances and ignore those of @xmath106 in our lhc analysis for the diphoton signals .",
    "there is degeneracy of states with different angular momenta at each sr as can be seen from the dependence on different powers of @xmath90 for each @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:7.1 ] ) .",
    "generically , any amplitude @xmath107 can be expanded in terms of the wigner functions @xmath108 @xcite as @xmath109 where @xmath110 , and @xmath111 are the partial wave amplitudes corresponding to a definite angular momentum state @xmath112 .           for completeness , in table [ alpha ]",
    "we provide the expansion coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ expand ] ) , and the relevant wigner functions are @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "numerically , the total widths for each processes when @xmath116 are @xmath117 where we have included all necessary decay modes into related final states for each resonance .",
    "for instance , the width @xmath118 includes the partial decay widths of sr into charged leptons , neutrinos , and quarks .",
    "partial decay modes into massive bosons such as the higgs and @xmath119 are not included .",
