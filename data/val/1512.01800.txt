    "point - contact ( pc ) spectroscopy of the electron- phonon interaction ( epi ) in normal metals @xcite enables direct measurement of the spectral function of epi under the condition that the inelastic electron mean - free path length @xmath5 is greater than the dimensions of the contact and the temperature is quite low ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the limiting phonon frequency ) .",
    "the purpose of this work is to obtain quantitative information about the epi in tantalum - determine the absolute intensity of the pc epi function @xmath8 and the parameter @xmath0 and also to determine more accurately the form of the pc epi function .",
    "a new method was employed to prepare pure @xmath1 homocontacts and @xmath2 and @xmath3 heterocontacts , which enabled us to obtain high - intensity spectra .",
    "the value of the eep parameter @xmath0 in a pure homocontact is 6.5 times greater than the value obtained in the preceding work @xcite .",
    "it is demonstrated that quantitative information can be obtained about the epi of tantalum in @xmath2 heterocontacts .",
    "it was found that the contributions of copper and gold to the pc spectrum of the heterocontact are not noticeable though the form of the pc spectra of @xmath4 is different in homo- and heterocontacts .",
    "the reasons for these phenomena are established .",
    "it is shown that heterocontacts enable the determination of the ratio of the fermi velocities of the corresponding electrodes .",
    "a tantalum single - crystal with the resistance ratio @xmath9 , a copper single - crystal with the resistance ratio @xmath10 and a gold polycrystal with approximately the same value of @xmath11 were employed as the material for the electrodes .",
    "the electron momentum mean - free path length in tantalum at liquid - helium temperature , determined by the impurities , equals about 900  for our samples . in the estimate",
    "@xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13  @xcite were used .",
    "electrodes with dimensions of @xmath14 were cut out by the electric - spark method and subjected to chemical polishing in a mixture of concentrated acids . for tantalum , the mixture consisted of @xmath15 , taken in equal volume ratios , while for copper the mixture consisted of @xmath16 in the volume ratio 2:1:1 .",
    "the gold electrodes were chemically treated in aqua regia .",
    "the electrodes were then flushed in distilled water , dried , and mounted in a clamping device .",
    "the contacts were created by the modified shear method @xcite , and in so doing , in order to obtain stable pure contacts , the following procedure was employed : a reference current equal to @xmath17 was fixed with completely shunted samples , after which the shunts were switched off and a contact was obtained with a resistance from several hundreds to several thousands of ohms , most often with a dependence r(v ) of a nonmetallic type .",
    "after this the current was increased in steps with the help of a resistance box connected in series with the point contact .",
    "the initial resistance of the box was much greater than the resistance of the point contact .",
    "the voltage on the point contact in this case , as a rule , varied insignificantly and equaled @xmath18 . when the required resistance was achieved the contact",
    "was held under that current for several minutes .",
    "the contacts prepared in this manner were much cleaner than those prepared by the standard procedure @xcite and were distinguished by high mechanical and electric stability .",
    "we note that the quality of the spectra was significantly higher than those which we obtained previously@xcite . at the same time , together with a general increase in the intensity of the spectrum , the relative intensity of the peak increases significantly .",
    "this can be explained by the decrease in the degree of deformation of the material in the region of the contact @xcite when it is prepared .",
    "the critical fields required for suppressing superconductivity also dropped by a factor of 3 - 5 . with the new method for forming the contact with bias voltages of several hundreds of millivolts , the contact was in the normal regime .",
    "the temperature at the center of the contact reaches the softening point of the metal and , unlike impulsive breakdown , is maintained at this level for quite a long time , so as to order the crystal lattice of the metal in the region near the contact .",
    "additional purification of this region apparently also occurs at the same time by the electric transport method .",
    "we note that for electroforming the heating in the @xmath2 heterocontacts is not symmetric : only the tantalum edge is heated .",
    "this is linked with the fact that for high bias voltages the flight of the electrons from the copper side remains close to ballistic .",
    "this is indirectly confirmed by the change in the differential resistance - for @xmath19 homocontacts with bias voltages of the order of 300 - 350 @xmath20 it increases by 20 - 40% compared with @xmath21 , while for @xmath2 heterocontacts and @xmath1 homocontacts it more than doubles for such bias voltages .    since the short - circuiting begins most often with a resistance of several kiloohms , while the final resistances of the point contact equal , as a rule , not more than several tens of ohms , the shunting of the short circuit by the tunneling gap of the reference oxide by the comparison resistance is eliminated .",
    "multiple contacts are also unlikely to form under conditions of electroforming .",
    "another advantage of this method is the possibility of `` growing '' short - circuits with the required resistance with an accuracy of several percent .",
    "the same method was also employed to prepare @xmath3 point contacts , i.e. , the method is in principle also applicable to metals which are mutually soluble ( copper and tantalum are not mutually soluble in the solid and liquid phases ) .",
    "some of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 point contacts were prepared by the standard shear method .",
    "the optimal resistances of the point contacts , prepared by electro - forming , turned out to be several times higher than the corresponding values for point contacts prepared by the standard shear method .",
    "this could be attributable to the difference in the form of the short - circuits formed : in the shear method the short - circuit apparently forms along cracks in the reference oxide , and in this case its form is described best by the model of a prolate ellipse . for electroforming ,",
    "the form of the short circuit is probably closer to a circular opening .",
    "measurements were performed in an intermediate cryostat with a capillary , structurally analogous to that described in ref.@xcite , in the temperature range 1.4 - 6 k. for measurements of the pc characteristics in the normal state the superconductivity was destroyed either with a magnetic field from a superconducting solenoid or by raising the temperature above @xmath22 for tantalum .",
    "for a detailed investigation the point contacts were selected beforehand according to quality criteria described in ref.@xcite because the electron energy mean - free path length at energies close to the debye energy is quite short , the best results were obtained for comparatively high - resistance samples , whose resistance fell into the range from 20 to @xmath23 .",

    "one possible reason for this strong difference in absolute intensities and the form of ta spectra in homo- and heterocontacts could be the following .",
    "the difference in the absolute intensities of pc epi functions and eliashberg s thermodynamic epi function is linked with the different form factors - in the case of the thermodynamic function every electron scattering event is effective , and for the pc epi function large - angle scattering processes make the main contribution .",
    "this is usually also linked with the decrease in the relative intensity of the high - frequency maximum in the pc spectra @xcite . in a heterocontact the tangential component of the electron momentum is conserved across the interface .",
    "for this reason any electron that has undergone inelastic scattering in tantalum and whose @xmath72 component of the momentum has been reversed will return into the copper , being deflected after refraction at the boundary toward the @xmath72 axis , which increases the contribution of small - angle scattering processes in @xmath4 to the `` return current '' , which determines the inelastic correction to the current through the point contact .",
    "( we note that the maximum angle of incidence of the electrons from the copper side , when total internal reflection does not yet occur , equals @xmath216 with respect to the @xmath72 axis . ) at the same time the form factor for the metal with the lower value of @xmath217 also approaches the form factor of eliashberg s thermodynamic function , while the absolute intensities of the pc function @xmath114 and the epi parameter @xmath0 become closer to the corresponding values of the thermodynamic function .",
    "this is also indicated by the closer form of the pc epi function of the heterocontact ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , curves 4 - 6 ) and the thermodynamic epi function ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , curve 7 ) .",
    "we note that the pc spectrum of the metal with the large value of @xmath89 in the heterocontact undergoes opposite changes , owing to the fact that the scattering by angles @xmath218 does not contribute to the return current ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and thereby accentuates the effect of the @xmath219 factor , which emphasizes the scattering by large angles .",
    "therefore if we could separate out the low intensity contribution to the pc spectrum from the metal with large @xmath220 , we would see that its form differs even more strongly from eliashberg s epi function than the form of the pc epi function obtained from the spectrum of the homocontact of this metal . at the same time , as one can see from table i , a physically more reliable result for @xmath221 is obtained using @xmath210 .",

    "does not depend on @xmath232 . in this case",
    "@xmath233.\\ ] ] the deviation of @xmath140 from 1 affects the magnitude of the excess current much more strongly than it affects the intensity of the spectrum .",
    "thus the excess current for @xmath234 is half of the excess current for @xmath235 , while the intensity of the spectrum in this case equals @xmath236 of the starting intensity .    in our experiments",
    "there was no correlation between the absolute intensity of the spectrum and the magnitude of the excess current , observed in refs . @xcite and @xcite for tin contacts .",
    "the superconducting characteristics turned out to be more sensitive to contamination than the spectral characteristics .",
    "the magnitude of the excess current in the contacts with an intense spectrum in the n state could vary from 0 up to 0.8 of the theoretical value for a clean @xmath231 contact , but the critical josephson current was almost always absent .",
    "this indicates the presence of depairing centers in the plane of the constriction . in heterocontacts with an intense pc spectrum",
    "the parameter @xmath226 could vary from 0 to 1.1 .",
    "from here it follows that at least for @xmath237 a geometric asymmetry of the heterocontact existed and @xmath4 filled most of the volume near the constriction , and in addition in this asymmetric heterocontact for @xmath226 close to 1.1 the ballistic regime was realized .    in this case",
    "it is obvious that the absolute intensity of the pc function @xmath114 and the epi parameter @xmath0 , calculated for the @xmath2 heterocontact , are close , just like for a @xmath1 heterocontact with the same resistance and the same characteristics calculated for @xmath1 homocontacts .",
    "the reason for the fact that copper does not contribute to the spectrum is also understandable .",
    "the decrease in the relative intensity of the @xmath206 peak in the homocontact compared with the heterocontacts could be linked with the heating of the contact for energies close to the debye energies .",
    "the typical resistances of our contacts equal @xmath238 , which corresponds to diameters of 120 - 50  .",
    "if the energy mean - free path length is evaluated from the relation @xmath239 ( here @xmath240 ) is the energy relaxation time and @xmath121 is eliashberg s thermodynamic function , given , e.g. , in the tables of ref .",
    "then for @xmath241 we have @xmath242 , i.e. , contacts with the lowest resistances at energies close to the debye energies must be in a state close to the thermal state , when spectroscopy is impossible .",
    "at the same time , although the background for the high - resistance contacts is high ( 50 - 70% ) and the intensity of the @xmath206 peak is lowered appreciably , it is nonetheless quite well resolved .",
    "this indicates that it is incorrect to use the relation indicated above for determining the energy relaxation time , since this relation is predicated on the equilibrium electron distribution function .",
    "a substantially nonequilibrium electron distribution function is realized in the point contact near the constriction , and although the energy electron mean - free path length is much greater than the diameter of the contact , it is still not large enough , which increases the background and decreases the intensity of the @xmath206 peak .",
    "it is much easier to satisfy the condition @xmath243 with the use of copper as the counterelectrode , since there are no restrictions from the side of the copper edge and the condition @xmath244 ( @xmath245 is the radius of the contact ) must be satisfied .",
    "the decrease in the background level in heterocontacts is also explained by the lower heating of the contact owing to the much better thermal conductivity of the copper edge , which efficiently removes heat .",
    "the two possibilities , however , are not mutually exclusive .",
    "both symmetric and unsymmetric heterocontacts with a dominant contribution of tantalum are apparently realized . at the same time , as the interface between the metals moves away from the plane of the geometric symmetry of the contact , the effective volume of phonon generation in tantalum increases and the effect of the @xmath134 function barrier between the metals owing to the difference in the fermi velocities decreases .",
    "at the same time , the effect of the form factor , which is determined by the difference in the fermi momenta and the intensity of the pc epi function of the metal with the smaller value of @xmath246 , approaching eliashberg s thermodynamic function , also decreases . in @xmath2 heterocontacts , the mutual effect of these factors",
    "is largely compensated , and for this reason the contribution of copper to the spectrum is not noticeable , while the intensity of the spectra does not change much as the symmetry of the contact changes .",
    "the magnitude of the excess current , however , changes at the same time over a wide range . to check this proposition , we prepared a series of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 contacts using the standard shear method , with which a geometrically symmetric contact is most likely to be formed .",
    "as in the case of the electroforming of contacts , however , no contribution from copper and gold to the spectrum was observed in heterocontacts .",
    "the absolute intensity of the spectra for @xmath1 homocontacts and @xmath2 heterocontacts in this case was much lower than with electroforming , and turned out to be close to the absolute intensity of the spectra which we obtained previously @xcite . in the case of @xmath3 point contacts ,",
    "the absolute intensity of the pc spectra obtained for electrically formed point contacts turned out to be only slightly higher than for point contacts prepared by the standard shear method @xcite .",
    "this is apparently explained by the mutual solubility of @xmath247a and @xmath248 .",

    "[ fig2 ] correspond to the free - electron approximation , and in addition in heterocontacts the values of @xmath194 and @xmath195 were calculated just as for homocontacts with the same resistance .",
    "all estimates made above must be treated with care . since @xmath260 metals have two groups of valence electrons , in different experiments one or another group of electrons can make the dominant contribution . for example , in niobium , which is the electronic analog of tantalum , the fermi velocity , determined in optical measurements , @xmath261 ( ref .",

    "the calculation is based on the results of the theory of shekhter and kulik @xcite , and the case of the ballistic contacts in the approximation of a spherical fermi surface was examined .",
