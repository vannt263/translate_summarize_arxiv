    "both classical and quantum topology in 3-dimensions are mature subjects , but deep connections between the two worlds are still rare .",
    "since the classical world is a limit of the quantum world when the planck constant goes to zero , we expect classical topological information to emerge from quantum topology when the level @xmath3 of the physical quantum witten - chern - simons theories @xcite for a simple lie group @xmath2 goes to infinity .",
    "two possible instances of this phenomena are the volume conjecture and asymptotic faithfulness of mapping class group representations .",
    "the mathematical realization of quantum witten-@xmath2-chern - simons theories at level=@xmath3 is commonly considered to be the reshetikhin - turaev tqfts from the modular tensor categories ( mtcs ) @xmath4 @xcite . a closely related construction of tqfts is through skein theory , where the temperley - lieb algebras as rediscovered by jones @xcite and reformulated by kauffman @xcite using diagrams are exemplars of theories related to @xmath0 , called the jones - kauffman tqfts @xcite .",
    "contrary to many claims in the literature , these two versions of tqfts , though closely related , are different as their underlying mtcs are different .",
    "for example , in the @xmath0 level=2 case , the mtc @xmath5 for reshetikhin - turaev tqft has central charge @xmath6 , while the skein jones - kauffman mtc is the ising category with @xmath7 @xcite . more concretely , when looking at the mapping class group respresentation of the torus the image of the dehn twist along the meridinal curve is the @xmath8-matrix of the mtcs , they are @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively . in general , there are non - trivial frobenius - schur indicators in the reshetikhin - turaev tqfts , which make them hard to work with using graphical calculus .",
    "we choose to work with the jones - kauffman tqfts and their skein generalizations due to their elementary combinatorial nature , and study the asymptotic faithfulness of their representations of the mapping class groups of orientable closed surfaces . in @xcite ,",
    "the asymptotic faithfulness is verified for @xmath0 and we generalize it to @xmath1 in this note .",
    "our results are parallel to he asymptotic faithfulness of the representations from quantum @xmath11 reshetikhin - turaev tqfts @xcite .",
    "a salient feature of @xmath0-tqfts is the multiplicity - freeness of all fusion spaces : the dimension of the space for a labeled pair of pants is either @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "another convenience is that all simple objects are self - dual with trivial frobenius - schur indicators .",
    "it follows that the skein theory requires only unoriented simple closed curves and unoriented trivalent graphs with uncolored tri - valent vertices .",
    "then a complexity of a state vector for an induction has obvious topological meaning as the measure of the number of parallel simple closed curves . to generalize to @xmath1",
    ", we have to use oriented curves and colored trivalent vertex .",
    "once we identify the right complexity , our proof is completely analogous to the @xmath0 case .",
    "another key ingredient is the explicit knowledge of the fusion spaces given by the generalizations of jones - wenzl projectors .",
    "the difficulty in extending this result to the other rank @xmath14 spiders of kuperberg lies in obtaining an explicit description of the triangle spaces . for the construction of a basis",
    "the key result obtained in @xcite allows our argument to be carried through .",
    "in particular we have for the @xmath15 the parameter @xmath16 described below is a crucial simplification that is not easily extended to the other spiders .",
    "turaev asked in @xcite : is the ( projective ) action of the mapping class group of a closed oriented surface @xmath17 in the module of states of @xmath17 irreducible ?",
    "consider the kernels of these actions corresponding to all modular categories .",
    "is the intersection of these kernels non - trivial ? ( this would be hard to believe . ) \" in the specific case of skein @xmath4 tqfts we conjecture that asymptotic faithfulness holds , meaning that the intersection of the kernels are the central elements of the mapping class group .",
    "the spiders are skein constructions of the representation theory of a rank @xmath14 lie algebra , which provide a generalization of the temperley - lieb algebra for @xmath18 to @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we will only focus on the case of @xmath15 , as our interest will be in @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath15 spider is generated by the following two webs seen in figure @xmath13        subject to the following relations in figure @xmath14 .",
    "relations ]    kuperberg abstractly proved the existence of generalized jones - wenzl idempotents for the simple lie algebras of rank @xmath14 , which are called clasps @xcite .",
    "the work of kim developed the theory of jones - wenzl idempotents for rank @xmath14 lie algebras , and in particular for @xmath15 .",
    "a graphical recursion was found for these projectors @xcite .",
    "these are the minimal projectors in the skein algebra of the disk .",
    "they satisfy the annihilation axiom as well , under both @xmath22 and caps .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath23 for the fundamental projector indexed by @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "to build up the theory of the interwiner spaces in the @xmath15 web in the classic case , we turn our attention to @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28    corresponding to the disc with @xmath29 entries and @xmath30 exits , where these boundary points are organized into three groups , the projector @xmath31 is placed on the corresponding grouping .",
    "up to an invertible scalar from above , this construction gives us an isomorphism class of vector spaces , called the intertwiner space of type @xmath32 , denoted @xmath33 , which will be referred to as the fusion or triangle space @xmath34 .",
    "illustrated below is an element of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 represents a skein in the disc .",
    "a necessary condition for the intertwiner spaces to be nontrivial is @xmath37 where @xmath16 is a parameter of the space .",

    "this implies that as long as @xmath69 , the fundamental projectors are identical at level @xmath3 to the classical case , which immediately implies that as as long as @xmath70 the triangle spaces are similarly the same as the classical case .",
    "proofs are contained in chapter @xmath71 of @xcite .",
    "a construction is known which builds a tqft from a manifold invariant generated by a skein theory @xcite . in order for this construction to work the skein theory",
    "must satisfy some properties , which can be found in @xcite .",
    "lickorish established that the @xmath73 skein theory of yokota satisfies these properties and can be used to build such a tqft @xcite .",
    "we will work with the specialization of his work to @xmath1 where the manifold invariant was first developed by ohtsuki and yomada .",
    "more general approach to constructing picture tqfts is outlined in @xcite .    a second construction of this tqft follows from the general procedure in @xcite . results of blanchet have shown that the skein theory of yokota allow for the construction of @xmath74 as a modular tensor category @xcite .",
    "to describe the vector space @xmath72 given by our @xmath75 tqft , we fix a level @xmath3 of the theory .",
    "a vector space @xmath72 is spanned by admissible labelings of a spine of @xmath76 .",
    "a pants decomposition of @xmath76 leads to a spine of @xmath76 using the dual trivalent graph of that pants decomposition inside the handlebody @xmath77 bounded by @xmath76 .",
    "an admissible labeling of a trivalent graph ia defined as follows . each edge of the trivalent graph is associated with a fundamental projector , and each vertex a vector from the triangle space of the three incident edges .",
    "then @xmath72 is defined to be the free complex vector space spanned by each admissible labeling of a spine of @xmath76 .",
    "equivalently @xmath72 is the reduced skein space , generated by framed links in @xmath78 and subject to relations coming from the kernel of a bilinear pairing .",
    "let @xmath79 be an orientation preserving homeomorphism .",
    "now we look to define an action @xmath80 this action arises through the skein theoretic description given by ohtsuki and yamada@xcite .",
    "we describe the action @xmath81 when @xmath82 is a positive dehn twist about a curve @xmath83 .",
    "if we take @xmath84 to be a labeling of a spine of @xmath76 then we have @xmath85 is the labeling which is given by taking @xmath86 and adjoining the skein representing the label @xmath86 with the curve @xmath87 , colored with @xmath88 , inserted inside the boundary with a @xmath89 framing relative to the boundary . where @xmath88 is as defined in @xcite .",
    "the sliding property , balanced stabilization hold @xcite .",
    "let @xmath76 be a closed , oriented surface , @xmath79 an orientation preserving homeomoprhism , and @xmath90 the action of @xmath82 on @xmath91 .",
    "let @xmath92 and @xmath93 similar",
    ". then @xmath94    to begin we note that it suffices to assume that @xmath82 is a positive dehn twist about a curve @xmath87 . following the above description of the action we will have a skein stacked with @xmath87 labeled with @xmath95 and",
    "framed placed over the curve @xmath96 placed over the curve @xmath87 labeled with @xmath95 with the opposite framing , as seen on the left of figure @xmath97 . then using the handle slide property of @xmath95 we are able to pull the bottom copy of @xmath87 through @xmath96 at the cost of a dehn twist about @xmath87 .",
    "this leaves us with @xmath93 and two copies of @xmath87 having opposite framings .",
    "finally we apply the balanced stabilization property of @xmath95 to cancel these opposite copies .",
    "this is visualized in figure @xmath71 in the case where @xmath76 is the torus with each parallel square having edges identified , and @xmath87 and @xmath96 are the meridian and longitude respectively .",
    "we start with two key lemmas .",
    "let @xmath96 and @xmath98 be two non - trivial , non - isotopic simple closed curves on a closed orientable surface @xmath76 .",
    "then there exists a pants decomposition of @xmath76 such that @xmath96 is one of the decomposing curves and @xmath98 is a non - trivial `` graph geodesic '' with respect to the decomposition .",
    "( that is , @xmath98 does not intersect any curve of the decomposition twice in a row ) .",
    "suppose there exists an unoriented simple closed curve @xmath100 such that @xmath101 is not isotopic ( as a set ) to @xmath96 .",
    "then @xmath81 is a multiple of the identity for at most finitely many @xmath3 .",
    "that is , as @xmath3 increases @xmath82 is eventually detected .      by lemma @xmath104 above",
    ", there exists a handlebody @xmath77 bounded by @xmath76 such that @xmath96 bounds an embedded disk in @xmath77 and @xmath101 is a non - trivial graph graph geodesic with respect to a spine @xmath105 of @xmath77 .",
    "this is illustrated below , where encircled region is exactly what is forbidden by the graph geodesic property .",
    "now let @xmath106 be the vector determined by @xmath77 with the empty labeling , and @xmath107 the vector determined by the pair @xmath108 ( where @xmath101 is pushed into the interior of @xmath77 ) .",

    "we have @xmath133 passing through the disk .",

    "this decomposition follows from an inductive argument .",
    "we are left to look at the vertex of each trivalent graph .",
    "this vertex is a skein in the triangle space of @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",

    "there exists an @xmath129 such that @xmath128 .",
    "thus @xmath143 as we can do this for each vertex and we will have a nonzero scalar pulled from each one",
