    "it will be shown that the nature of gap states and detailed property of superconducting mechanism plays a much less prominent role than that of the geometrical factors .",

    "the bogoliubov approximation will be applied for the model hamiltonian in weakly interacting regime to calculate the condensate .",
    "the condensate fraction will be calculated as a function of temperature and dimensionality between 2 and 3 .",

    "finally , the theoretical results on the charged bosons in fractal dimensions between 2 and 3 will be compared to experimental data on superfluid density of superconducting films and the physical implications will be discussed .",

    "3 we note that @xmath59 is proportional to the superfluid density @xcite , and inverse of the sheet inductance , @xmath60 , is also proportional to the areal superfluid density , @xmath61@xcite .",
    "we observe that the two figures in fig .",
    "3 exhibit the same generic splitting behavior for samples with various thickness . considering differences in the detailed physical properties between lsco and moge films ,",
    "such qualitative similarity is quite surprising and , thus , it strongly implies that the generic behavior stems from some hidden common properties .",
    "there have been several theoretical efforts to explain the general features of the superfluid density of superconducting films .",
    "it has been shown that the simple bcs and the d - wave symmetry just lead into a quadratic dependence of @xmath62@xcite and , thus , can not explain the generic splitting behavior .",
    "effect of thermal fluctuations is shown to explain the relative flat behavior of curves at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "but it could not also explain the above mentioned behavior .",
    "since the superconducting mechanisms of lsco is believed to be basically different from that of moge , any theory which explains the behavior should not be based on the microscopic details of the superconducting mechanisms of the two materials . instead",
    ", it should mainly reflect the common geometric nature of superconducting films .",
    "it has been shown that condensation of bound pairs can be used to explain the superconductivity with proper scaling@xcite . in the previous section",
    ", we have shown that the superfluid density , which originates from the charged boson condensation in fractal dimensions , @xmath63 , exactly duplicates the observed experimental data from the superconducting films .",
    "therefore , we believe that the theoretical results in fig . 2 are the natural explanation of the experimental observations in fig .",
    "we note also that the general features of the superfluid density curves of the superconducting films are qualitatively similar to those of liquid helium-4 in films and porous media@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the condensate of charged boson fluid at finite temperatures in non - integer dimensions between 2 and 3 .",
    "the condensate and superfluid fraction are obtained as functions of temperature and dimensions at various values of the coupling strength .",
    "we have shown that the generic splitting behavior of the superfluid density universal for superconducting films may originate from the geometric nature of the films and detailed nature of the superconducting mechanism plays a much less prominent role than generally believed .",
