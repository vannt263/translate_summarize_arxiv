    "the coupling of light with an atomic state depends basically on two factors : ( a ) the spread of the wave function or dipole moment of the atomic state , and ( b ) the density of photon states in the energy region of interest . in the search for optimizing this coupling , atomic rydberg states and three - dimensional microcavities , where the photon modes exhibit a discrete spectrum ,",
    "have been used .",
    "one of the salient realizations is the construction of micromasers @xcite .",
    "more recently , excitonic states in quantum dots have proven to be excellent candidates to replace atomic rydberg states in a microcavity . from one side",
    ", quantum dots can easily be incorporated inside the microcavity by means of modern semiconductor technology , thus avoiding the complicated step in which a beam of atoms in rydberg states is prepared . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective bohr radius in a semiconductor is a factor of @xmath0 larger than the corresponding radius in vacuum , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are , respectively , the electron mass and dielectric constant of vacuum , and @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the corresponding magnitudes in the semiconductor . in gaas , for example , this factor is around 200 . as a result , the ground - state exciton wave function is as spread as an atomic rydberg state .",
    "transitions energies are typically in the infrared range .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the dynamics of a quantum dot - microcavity system , focusing on the stationary or asymptotic photonic states in the cavity .",
    "a previous , very serious , study of this dynamics @xcite has been motivated by recent experimental work @xcite , and theoretical papers @xcite , in which the exciton - cavity coupling is characterized , and the system is shown to serve as an efficient source of single triggered photons , and a possible source of entangled photons .    the results of ref .",
    "rely on the assumption that the quantum dot may support only one excitonic state ( a shallow dot ) .",
    "we relax this assumption , allowing more than one excitonic state in the dot .",
    "coulomb interactions among particles are shown to play an important role in the dynamics , shifting the single - pair levels , modifying the rabi frequencies , and causing interference effects . the most relevant consequence of including additional pair states in the dot , however , is shown to be the existence of asymptotic oscillatory states , in which the number of photons oscillates around a mean value , with periods between 0.5 and 1.5 ps ( for the set of parameters used in the calculations ) .",
    "we keep the assumption that the excitonic states are coupled to a single photon mode .",
    "this means that the separation between photon modes in the cavity should be larger than the splitting between excitonic states in the dot .",
    "as the latter magnitude is of the order of a few mev , our results will be valid for cavities with a radius of 0.5 @xmath5 m or smaller @xcite .    a second ,",
    "simplifying , working hypothesis is the mean field approximation . for electrons ,",
    "it means the neglect of correlation terms in the evolution ( bloch ) equations . for light",
    ", we use a semiclassical or coherent ( lamb ) description , in which the field is characterized by an amplitude and a phase .",
    "let us stress that , in the intervals of parameters we consider , when the number of photons proves to be significantly different from zero the statistics of the photon field is poissonian or near poissonian , at least in the one - exciton dot @xcite , in such a way that the coherent approximation for the photon field is justified .",
    "the reward from this simplification is that the system of evolution equations is relatively small , allowing a qualitative analysis of its solutions , and the extension to deeper dots , which may support more than one electron - hole states .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the basic evolution ( bloch - lamb ) equations are obtained , and the initial conditions used to solve them are discussed .",
    "[ sec3 ] is devoted to the presentation of results .",
    "the one- , two- , and three - states dots coupled to a single photon mode ( with a given polarization ) are studied .",
    "additionally , the two - states dot coupled to a polarization degenerated light mode is also considered . finally , concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "our model microcavity is assumed to have an ideal cylindrical shape .",
    "its radius is lower than 0.5 @xmath5 m , in such a way that the spacing between photon modes is of the order of 20 mev.@xcite we will be interested in one of these modes . to fix ideas , we speak about the lowest mode , polarization degenerated , which is called he@xmath6 according to the terminology for modes in a guide @xcite . in the paper , we will conventionally denote the two polarization components as @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "a quantum dot is located at a point along the cavity axis in which the electric field has a maximum .",
    "we assume a gaas dot .",
    "the dot has also a cylindrical shape .",
    "its height is lower than 10 nm , in such a way that light - hole sub - bands have higher energy than the heavy - hole ones and , in a first approximation , could be ignored in the dynamics .",
    "a second reason for not including light holes is that their coupling to the photon modes is a factor of 3 less intense than the heavy hole coupling @xcite .",
    "electron - hole pairing is induced by both coulomb interactions and the coupling to the photon mode .",
    "thus , in addition to the electron , hole and photon populations :    @xmath9    in these equations , @xmath10 and @xmath11 label electron and hole single - particle states in the dot . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the corresponding creation operators . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are operators for the two photon polarizations . in the @xmath16 functions , we have explicitly indicated the electron and hole states that are coupled to a polarized mode .",
    "for example , in @xmath17 the coupling of a spin - down electron state ( @xmath18 ) with a `` spin - up '' hole state ( coming from a @xmath19 electron state in the valence band ) is due to the @xmath7 mode , and it is reinforced by coulomb interactions .",
    "notice also that we have assumed pairing between specific electron and hole states , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( orbitals ) .",
    "we will use a harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath10 characterized by radial and angular momentum projection quantum numbers , @xmath20 , the hole state coupled to @xmath10 is @xmath21 .",
    "the pair is created in a zero total angular momentum state , corresponding to the selection rule for interband transitions @xcite .",
    "mean values , @xmath22 , come from averaging with a density matrix .",
    "we are interested in the very low temperature , @xmath23 limit .",
    "this density matrix is time dependent .",
    "thus , the population and polarization functions , eqs .",
    "( [ eq1]-[eq6 ] ) , are time - dependent functions",
    ". we will derive dynamical equations for their time evolution ( bloch - lamb equations ) .",
    "a further simplification equates @xmath24 .",
    "this means that the dot is initially neutral , and that we are interested in the dynamics over a time interval smaller than ( or of the order of ) the relaxation times in the dot ( the coherent regime @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , we will follow the dynamics in the time interval ( 0 , 20 ps ) .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the quantum dot - microcavity system can be written in the following form :    @xmath25    the @xmath26 functions refer to the single - particle energies of the used basis states . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath27 are the matrix elements of the external ( quantum dot ) confinement potential .",
    "@xmath28 is the strenght of coulomb interactions , and @xmath29 the strenght of the electron - photon coupling ( assumed constant ) .",
    "the energy of the photon mode is written as @xmath30 .",
    "the dynamical equations are obtained by taking time derivatives of the occupation and polarization functions ( [ eq1]-[eq6 ] ) .",
    "one gets for @xmath31 , for example :    @xmath32\\;\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    once the commutator is computed , we take the mean - field or quasiparticle contribution ( in which mean values of products of four or more operators are expressed in terms of products of occupations and polarization functions ) , and neglect the collision terms @xcite .",
    "the result for @xmath33 is :    @xmath34    and a similar equation for @xmath35 .",
    "notice that coulomb interactions preserve spin .",
    "thus , if @xmath10 is a spin - down state ( as assumed in eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) ) , the @xmath36 states entering the sum should be spin - down states also .",
    "this is the reason why only @xmath17 functions enter the sum .    the equation for the photon number is straightforwardly obtained also , and leads to :    @xmath37    notice the conservation of the polariton number , as it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) ( or directly from the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) ) : @xmath38 , where :    @xmath39    the equations for the polarization functions , @xmath16 , are obtained in the same way .",
    "we shall stress , however , that the modulus , @xmath40 , is determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) , and it follows that @xmath41 .",
    "nevertheless , we are forced to use the equation for @xmath42 in order to determine its phase .    in the same way ,",
    "the modulus of @xmath7 ( understood as @xmath43 ) is determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) , but its phase is not .",
    "thus , we must write the equation for @xmath7 .    both @xmath44 and @xmath16 should contain a rapidly varying phase factor , @xmath45 , due simply to the frequency of rotation of the electric field .",
    "for example , @xmath46 ps@xmath47 for the gaas band gap .",
    "in contrast , we expect characteristic frequencies of the order of @xmath48 1 ps@xmath47 in the variation of @xmath31 or @xmath49 .",

    "typical values of @xmath150 are around 5 ps or larger @xcite . then , there is a new nontrivial situation for the @xmath130 dot , in which one electron - hole pair is coupled to the @xmath7 photon mode , and the second one to the @xmath8 mode .",

    "the zeeman splitting between exciton states is around 0.7 mev .",
    "the lowest exciton state is coupled to the @xmath8 photon .",
    "then , in the equation for @xmath151 ( the exciton coupled to the @xmath7 photon ) , we add a term    @xmath152    and for @xmath153 a term    @xmath154    notice the pauli blocking factors in them .",
    "spin - flip transitions from @xmath153 to @xmath151 would require an activation mechanism to overcome the energy barrier , and will not be included .",
    "the results for the system with cavity parameters @xmath122 ps@xmath47 , @xmath155 ps@xmath47 , @xmath156 ps@xmath47 , are shown in fig .",

    "step - like variations in one of the photon populations are transmitted to the other photon number .",
    "interesting enough is the region @xmath158 ps@xmath47 , where there are only @xmath8 photons in spite of the fact that @xmath159 .",
    "we have explicitly written and numerically solved the evolution ( bloch - lamb ) equations describing the dynamics of a quantum dot - microcavity system .",
    "the main simplifications contained in our equations are the following : ( a ) they are mean field equations , i.e. , dot not contain particle - particle correlations , and ( b ) the photon field is coherent . assumption ( b )",
    "is closely related to ( a ) .",
    "the reward from this simplified approach is that the system of equations is relatively small , allowing a qualitative analysis of its solutions and the extension to larger dots , which may support more than one electron - hole pair .    in the simplest system with @xmath106 ,",
    "the qualitative analysis revealed the existence of resonance intervals for the parameters , where the coupling to the photon field of the cavity is optimal and the number of photons in the stationary state reaches a maximum .",
    "there is also a second stable stationary state , which is not reached because the used ( null ) initial conditions is not in its basin of attraction .",
    "the two stable solutions should be further analysed focusing on a possible optical bistability in this system@xcite . outside the resonance interval , one of the stable states dissapears ( suggesting a bifurcation ) leading to the appearence of stable periodic orbits in which the physical magnitudes oscillate . in this",
    "oscillatory states , the quantum dot is periodically absorbing and emitting photons from and to the cavity . under strong pumping , the transition resonance - out of resonance may be almost step - like , a fact which may also have interesting applications .",
    "we have left many questions unexplored such as , for example , the width of the resonance interval in @xmath101 , or the transient time before the stationary state is reached , as functions of the system parameters .",
    "let us stress that the existence of two stable stationary solutions are intuitively related to the two possible couplings between an exciton and a photon ( the two polariton branches in a quantum well under weak coupling , for example ) .",
    "however , we can not yet understand the way they may arise from the system of linear equations of ref . .",
    "we think that the truncation fo the photon fock space is responsible for this difference with our results .",
    "larger systems exhibit even more complex dynamics , which seems to strongly depend on the position of the single - pair levels .",
    "most of the new features are already seen in the @xmath130 dot , when both pair states are coupled to the same photon mode .",
    "we showed results for a dot in which the energy levels are 8 - 10 mev appart , in such a way that individual resonance intervals are resolved .",
    "coulomb interactions are shown to have drastic effects , not only on the level positions , but also causing interferences and altering the very nature of the stationary states .",
    "oscillatory states are reached almost for any values of the system parameters , even inside the resonance intervals .",
    "cooperative or non cooperative behavior of the single - pair levels are obtained in different parameter regions . in the @xmath144 system , these features are reinforced .",
    "the account of relaxation between electronic states or a change in the pumping scheme used to feed the dot are shown to have small impact on this qualitative and semiquantitative picture .",
    "other effects such as the coupling to the delocalized states of the wetting layer surrounding the self - assembled dot are to be considered .",
    "this coupling to the wetting layer is crucial in other contexts @xcite .",
