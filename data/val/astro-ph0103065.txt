    "nevertheless , the details of the earliest evolutionary steps remain somewhat unclear .",
    "the embedded flow at cepheus e ( hereafter cep e ) displays all the characteristics of an extremely young object still surrounded by a thick cocoon of cold gas ( e.  g. cernicharo et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and hence provides an ideal opportunity to study the development of molecular / ionic outflows and their surrounding environments during the earliest stages of star formation .",
    "cep e was identified originally as a cloud core in molecular co observations ( sargent  @xcite ) , and subsequently , an associated outflow was discovered ( see fukui  @xcite ; hodapp @xcite ) .",
    "the region around cep e has proved more complicated than the early co and the k@xmath4 observations indicated ; there are at least two other outflows besides the original compact north - south h@xmath0 flow identified by ladd & hodapp  ( @xcite ) .",
    "one is nearly perpendicular to the main h@xmath0 flow and appears as a faint chain of h@xmath0 1 - 0 s(1 )  2.121  emission knots towards the west ( eislffel et al .",

    "all three flows arise within a 5  region around iras 23011 + 6126 , which presumably encompasses the driving source ( lefloch , eislffel & lazareff @xcite ; noriega - crespo , garnavich & molinari @xcite , hereafter ncgm ; cernicharo et al .",

    "iras 23011 + 6126 is estimated to have a very high bolometric luminosity , @xmath7   ( lefloch et al .",

    "the blueshifted south lobe of the original h@xmath0 cep e outflow is observed at optical wavelengths as herbig - haro hh 337 , in the shock excited  and [ sii ] 6717/31 emission lines ( noriega - crespo @xcite ; devine , reipurth & bally @xcite ) . this collisionally excited emission is characteristic of an extremely low excitation hh object ( @xmath6  1@xmath8 ionization ) with an anomalously high electron density , n@xmath9  4100  , leading to an unusually high pre - shock density of @xmath10  ( ayala et al .",
    "@xcite ; hereafter aya ) .",
    "both the  and [ sii ] emission can be modeled using a j shock of v@xmath11  15 - 30  ( aya ) , although the near - ir h@xmath0 spectra agree better with c - shock models with v@xmath11  35  ( ladd & hodapp  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been suggested that a mach disk produces the optical emission while the ir emission arises from a bow shock ( aya ) .",
    "some of the first three dimensional simulations of molecular jets were intended to model the complex structure of the h@xmath0 cep e outflow ( suttner et al .",
    "surprisingly they demanded relatively large ( @xmath12 ) densities , which could be a sign of a very early stage of jet development .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the estimated dynamical age of the cep e outflow , @xmath13 years ( eislffel et al .",
    "@xcite ) , assuming a distance of 730 pc .",

    "( iso ) and the _ owens valley radio observatory _ ( ovro ) millimeter wave array at far / mid infrared and millimetric wavelengths at higher sensitivity and spatial resolution , permit not only a probe of deeper regions of the molecular environment surrounding the outflow , but also a determination of the main excitation and cooling mechanisms .",

    "figure 4 displays the images corresponding to the h@xmath0 0 - 0 s(2 ) to s(7 ) lines . in accord with expectations based on ground based optical and h@xmath0 observations at 2  , the south lobe is brighter at shorter wavelengths , as the flow breaks through the cloud .",
    "the north lobe , buried deeper in the cloud , has fainter s(3 )  9.66   and s(2 )  12.28  emission , due probably to the broad second maxima at 9.7   due to silicates ( si - o ) stretch mode in the extinction curve ( draine  @xcite , mathis  @xcite ) .",
    "the co and h@xmath0o emission can be studied by means of a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) model in spherical geometry , taking into account the first 35 rotational levels of co and the first 30 rotational levels of o - h@xmath0o .",

    "( @xcite ) for h@xmath0o .",
    "there are six main parameters to fit : temperature ( t ) , h@xmath0 density ( n(h@xmath0 ) ) , co and o - h@xmath0o column densities ( n(co ) and n(o - h@xmath0o ) ) , intrinsic width of the line ( v@xmath27 ) and angular size of the emitting area ( @xmath28 ) . to determine all of them simultaneously , two _ initial _ assumptions are necessary : ( 1 ) the co and o - h@xmath0o emission arise from the same region ; ( 2 ) the co lines are optically thin , i.e. their line fluxes do not depend on their intrinsic widths , while the o - h@xmath0o lines are optically thick .",
    "since the lws resolution is too poor to establish size and position of the emitting region , it is difficult to justify ( 1 ) from our data .",
    "however , in a 15   beam , the h@xmath0o emission in hh 7 - 11 appears to arise from the shocked regions already seen in the co emission bullets ( cernicharo , gonzalez - alfonso & bachiller ( @xcite ) and bachiller & cernicharo @xcite ) .",
    "the adoption of assumption ( 2 ) will be confirmed by our models .",
    "figure 5 shows the co line fluxes as a function of the rotational quantum number , j@xmath29 , for cep e north and south lobes .",
    "the shape of the distribution is determined only by t and n(h@xmath0 ) , while the absolute fluxes are determined by t , n(h@xmath0 ) and @xmath30n(co ) , which is proportional to the total number of co molecules within the emitting volume .",
    "two extreme cases for each lobe are consistent with the observations .",
    "all the models predict that the co lines are effectively optically thin .",
    "figure 5 shows that the agreement is good for j@xmath29@xmath1722 ; but for higher j@xmath29 the models underestimate the observed fluxes .",
    "this could indicate the existence of a hotter co gas component as suggested by spinoglio et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for t tau .    assuming that the co and the o - h@xmath0o line emission is from the same gas , the temperatures and densities derived from the co lines can be used to model the o - h@xmath0o line fluxes .",
    "since these lines are optically thick , their absolute fluxes depend on all the free parameters in the model , t , n(h@xmath0 ) , n(o - h@xmath0o ) , v@xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "their relative fluxes ( or line ratios ) , on the other hand , do not depend on @xmath28 . thus , with t and n(h@xmath0 ) known , the line ratios were modeled and the values of n(o - h@xmath0o ) and v@xmath27 were constrained .",
    "models of the absolute fluxes then allowed a derivation of @xmath28 .",
    "the o - h@xmath0o lines at 179 , 174 , 113 and 75   were used because they have the highest signal to noise ratio and because the o - h@xmath0o  179  /174",

    "@xcite ) .    according to the lvg models , the high - j co emission detected by iso - lws indicates a temperature between 220 k and 1200 k. since the contribution to low - j emission from gas at such temperatures is negligible , the iso observations must be tracing only the hottest shocked molecular material .",
    "by contrast , millimetric observations of the low - j emission ( j=2 - 1 , lefloch et al .",

    "thus the existence of a global fuv field can be indirectly inferred from the presence of extended pahs emission over the entire fov of the cvf isocam observations ( see figure 3 ) . however , the pahs emission could arise anywhere along the line of sight to cep e.    cep e is near the cepheus ob3 association ( sargent  @xcite ) with members at distances of 500 - 1000 pc ( crawford & barnes @xcite ; jordi , trullois & galadi - enrquez  @xcite ) .",
    "since there are at least 42 bona fide o and b stars in the association ( garmany  @xcite ; naylor & fabian  @xcite ) , the diffuse fuv field should be sufficient to generate the observed [ c  ii ] flux .",
    "one member , hd 217086 ( o7n ) , could by itself account for a fuv flux with g@xmath61  6 if it is at 725  pc ( garmany  @xcite ) , similar to the distance to cep e , and separated from cep e by @xmath6  80 .",
    "hipparcos measurements of hd 217086 give a parallax of 1.20@xmath62 0.92 milli - arcsec , approximately 100 pc farther away , but the errors are large .",
    "the cep e outflow can clearly be seen in the @xmath2co j = 1 - 0 transition at 110.2 ghz , shown in figure 9 .",
    "one of the most interesting features of this figure is how the @xmath2co emission is almost bounded by the h@xmath0 outflow lobes , except at the edge of the south flow , which is breaking through the molecular cloud .",
    "similar behavior is observed for the high velocity co gas in the hh 211 embedded outflow ( gueth & guilloteau  @xcite ; fig 4 ) , and in hh 1/2 ( moro - martin et al .",
    "@xcite , fig 2c ) .",
    "in lte approximation , using an excitation temperature of 20 k ( ladd & hodapp @xcite ) , an abundance of @xmath2co / h@xmath0 @xmath6  1.2@xmath1910@xmath63 and an inclination angle of 45 , the following parameters are derived for the red and blue - shifted outflow lobes respectively : dynamical time scales of 4000 and 8000 years , masses of 0.08 and 0.05 , kinetic luminosities of 0.1  for both , and mass loss rates of 7@xmath1910@xmath63 and 6@xmath1910@xmath63 /year .",
    "nevertheless , these estimates are quite uncertain due to spatial filtering problems , core contamination , and the fact that the edges of the outflow are more than 20   from the phase center of the map , and thus affected by primary beam attenuation .",
    "figure 10 shows a position - velocity diagram along the outflow axis ( pa=10 ) with the ambient cloud at -11 and the outflow extending approximately from 0 to -20 .",
    "faint ( 2-@xmath25 ) emission is also seen at @xmath6  30 and -40 .",
    "we may be tracing high velocity gas that is concentrated nearer to the source than its low velocity counterpart .",
    "the left panel of figure 11 shows the emission from this gas integrated from -47 to -20   and from 0 to 25 .",
    "there is no correspondence between this high velocity @xmath2co component and the @xmath64 co 4 - 3 bullets detected by hatchell , fuller & ladd ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter are @xmath65 away from the core and have velocities of -120 and 60  lsr ( a velocity range not covered by our observations ) .",
    "a position - velocity diagram along the axis of the second outflow detected in @xmath64co by ladd & hodapp ( @xcite ) ( pa=-45 ) was also constructed but no emission was detected .",
    "images of the c@xmath23o j = 1 - 0 emission at 109.782182 ghz were also made , and show a core surrounded by a poorly imaged halo .",
    "there is no evidence of the cep e outflow , which is not unexpected from this optically thin emission .",
    "the right panels of figure 11 display the continuum emission at 222 ghz and 110 ghz around iras 23011 + 6126 .",
    "the 222 ghz image shows two unresolved sources in a 1.38@xmath191.06   beam , with integrated fluxes of 90 mjy and 67 mjy respectively . at 110 ghz ,",
    "the continuum emission is resolved and has a diameter of @xmath6 3   or @xmath6  2200 au ( at 730 pc ) and a flux of 35 mjy .",
    "it is tempting to interpret this observations as a double source surrounded by an envelope .",
    "the presence of a second source strongly suggests that the multiple outflows are due to multiple sources and not to precession .",
    "the projected distance between these sources is of @xmath66  or @xmath67 au at 730 pc .",
    "this separation implies a long orbital period , even for an intermediate mass system , with a range of @xmath68 - @xmath69 yrs , i.e. larger than the kinematical age of the outflow .    using a dust temperature of 18 k and @xmath70 @xmath6  2 ( ladd and howe @xcite )",
    ", a gas - to - dust ratio @xmath6  100 and dust opacities of 0.005 @xmath71g@xmath52 ( preibisch  @xcite ) , the masses associated with the two 222 ghz sources , within 1.4 , are 2.5  and 1.8 . from the 110 ghz continuum , the mass associated with the envelope is found to be 13.6 .",
    "ladd & howe ( @xcite ) , for comparison , computed a mass of 10   within a radius of 3000 au . at 110 ghz",
    ", there is no spatial resolution to separate the two sources .",
    "the cvf isocam observations clearly detect an embedded source that we identified with iras 23011 + 6126 .",
    "figure 12 shows the composite spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of iras 23011 + 6126 .",
    "it resembles that of a class i source ( lada @xcite ) , rather than a class 0 as proposed by lefloch et al ( @xcite ) , based on millimetric observations . presently , there are reasons to believe that the distinction between class 0 and class i is not as sharp as previously thought ( see e.  g. gregersen et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "following ncgm , model fits to the sed are calculated assuming : ( 1 ) a dust opacity dominated by bare silicates at a temperature of 18 k and a density of 7.5@xmath72 , and ( 2 ) silicates with a thin ice mantle at a temperature of 18 k and a density of 6@xmath72 .",
    "the models assume power - law density and temperature distributions , with a core inner radius of 0.065 au and outer radius of 2500 au . as figure 12 shows ,",
    "the continuum level of cam observations near log(@xmath73 ) @xmath6  13.3 is lower than that of the bare silicates model . as the success of the model using silicates with a thin ice mantle suggests , this can be attributed to absorption by h@xmath0o at 10 - 12  .",
    "the effect has been noticed in other low mass protostars such as elias 29 ( boogert @xcite ) .",
    "this model produces a mass envelope of 13.2   and bolometric luminosity of @xmath74 .",
    "comparable masses have been obtained assuming a constant density over a spherical volume ( 10  , ladd & howe @xcite ) and in dust temperature dependent models ( 18  , lefloch et al .",
    "the bolometric luminosity derived by our models , however , is a factor of 2 smaller that these cases @xmath75   versus 70   or 100  .",
    "we suspect the discrepancy is due to the integration methods used , since coarse approximations overestimate the integrated flux .",
    "our estimates of the luminosity and envelope mass are more appropriate for an intermediate mass object rather than a low mass class i system ; although not as massive and luminous as iras 05553 + 1631 (= gal 192.16 - 03.82 ) ( shepherd et al .",
    "@xcite ) or iras 20126 + 4104 ( shepherd et al .  @xcite ) .",
    "the cep e outflow has been studied in the mid ( @xmath76  ) and far infrared ( @xmath77  ) using the iso instruments cam and lws , and at millimetric wavelengths ( 110.2 and 222 ghz ) using ovro . in the near and mid - ir ,",
    "the cep e morphology is similar to that expected for a jet driven outflow , where the leading bow shocks entrain and accelerate the surrounding molecular gas ( e.  g. raga & cabrit  @xcite ; masson & chernin  @xcite ) .",
    "as expected , fine structure atomic / ionic emission lines are found , which very likely come from the leading bow shock , in both the mach disk and the stagnation tip , where j - shocks are dominant ( figure 13 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 , h@xmath0o and co molecular emission could arise further ` downstream ' at the bow shock wings where the shocks are oblique and more likely to be c - type ( smith  @xcite ) .",
    "the range of shock velocities to excite these species is @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath2co emission arises from entrained molecular gas and , as in other outflows , a compact high velocity emission is observed , together with an extended low velocity component that _ almost _ coincides spatially with the h@xmath0 near - ir emission .",
    "the millimetric continuum emission shows two sources .",
    "we identify one of them with iras 23011 + 6126 and we postulate that it is the driver of the cep e outflow ; the other , also an embedded source , is likely to be driving one of other outflows observed in the region .",
    "finally , the strong [ c  ii ] 158  emission must originate from an extended pdr , very likely excited by the nearby cepheus ob3 association .",
    "our main conclusions are :  1 . the mid infrared spectra show strong pure rotational h@xmath0 lines , that coincide spatially with the h@xmath0 1 - 0 s(1 ) 2.12  emission .",
    "excitation diagrams indicate that this emission is coming from a region at 1000@xmath201300 k , in agreement with the post - shock temperatures expected for shock velocities in the range 20@xmath2030 , consistent with c - shock diagnostics of h@xmath0 line ratios .  2 .",
    "the far infrared spectrum is rich in h@xmath0o and co lines .",
    "the line fluxes can be modeled using an lvg code , assuming that the h@xmath0o and co emission arises from the same region .",
    "two extreme models fit the observations , with temperatures either of 220 or 1200 k ( table 4 ) .",
    "the resulting h@xmath0o abundances are between 100 and 4000 times greater than the one found in quiescent molecular clouds , confirming once more the presence of high water abundance in the shocked gas associated with young stellar outflows . from comparison with shock models",
    ", we conclude that c - shocks with v@xmath43 @xmath6  8 - 14   can reproduce the h@xmath0o and co observations .",
    "3 . two strong atomic lines [ o  i ]  63   and [ c  ii ]  158   are present in the lws spectra .",
    "the ratio of their fluxes is close to 1 , indicating a pdr origin . taking into account the significant contribution to the [ o  i ] line from j - shocks , and comparing with pdr models ( kaufman et al  @xcite )",
    ", we find that two models reproduce the observations , g@xmath60 = 30 , n = 60  and g@xmath60 = 6 , n = 5500  erg s@xmath52 @xmath45 , where g@xmath60 is the incident fuv flux in units of @xmath59 erg s@xmath52 @xmath45 .",
    "cep e is relatively close to the cepheus ob3 association , which can produce the diffuse fuv field required by these models .",
    "the bipolar outflow can be seen in the high resolution @xmath2co image at 110.2 ghz .",
    "this emission is bounded by the h@xmath0 condensations .",
    "outflow velocities extend from 0 to -20 , and are centered on the ambient cloud velocity of -11 .",
    "there is also evidence for high velocity gas at 30 and -40   very close to the source . from the @xmath2co observations we estimate , for the north and south outflows lobes respectively , time scales of 4000 and 8000 years , masses of 0.08 and 0.05 , similar kinetic luminosities of 0.1  for both , and mass loss rates of @xmath79 and @xmath80 /year .",
    "this confirms that the outflow is very young as the high water abundance seems to indicate .",
    "the continuum images at 222 ghz show the presence of two unresolved sources within the positional error bars of iras 23011 + 6126 .",
    "the masses associated with them are 2.5  and 1.8 .",
    "the lower spatial resolution of the continuum observations at 110 ghz allow us to detect the surrounding envelope which has a mass of 13.6   and a radius of 1100 au .",
    "no evidence is found for any of the other outflows observed at near - infrared of radio wavelengths .",
    "the presence of a second source , however , strongly suggests that the multiple outflows are due to multiple sources and not to precession .",
    "the separation of these sources is about 1.4or @xmath67 au , and so even for an intermediate mass system , the binary period would be of the order of @xmath81 yrs , which is longer than the kinematical age of the outflow .",
    "a simple envelope model for the spectral energy distribution of iras 23011 + 6126 predicts a mass envelope of 13.2   and a luminosity of @xmath75   from silicates with thin ice mantles .",
    "the spectral features observed at 5@xmath2017  in iras 23011 + 6126 are closer to those of a class i source , and the mass and luminosity estimated are those of an intermediate mass yso , rather than a low mass class 0 object .",

    "<S> the cepheus e outflow has been studied in the mid and far infrared using the iso cam and lws instruments , and at millimetric wavelengths using ovro . in the near and mid - ir , </S>",
    "<S> its morphology is similar to that expected for a jet driven outflow , where the leading bow shocks entrain and accelerate the surrounding molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , fine structure atomic / ionic emission lines arise from the bow shocks , at both the mach disk and the stagnation tip , where j - shocks are dominant . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath0 , h@xmath0o and co molecular emission could arise further ` downstream ' at the bow shock wings where the shocks ( v = @xmath1 ) are oblique and more likely to be c - type . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2co emission arises from entrained molecular gas and a compact high velocity emission is observed , together with an extended low velocity component that _ almost _ coincides spatially with the h@xmath0 near - ir emission . </S>",
    "<S> the millimetric continuum emission shows two sources . </S>",
    "<S> we identify one of them with iras 23011 + 6126 , postulating is the driver of the cepheus e outflow ; the other , also an embedded source , is likely to be driving one of other outflows observed in the region . finally , we suggest that the strong [ c  ii ] 158  emission must originate from an extended photo - dissociation region , very likely excited by the nearby cepheus ob3 association .    </S>",
