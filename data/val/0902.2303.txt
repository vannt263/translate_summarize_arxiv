    "topological solitons in field theories over @xmath2 are typically classified by an integer - valued topological charge @xmath3 , and are usually thought of as being some superposition of @xmath3 basic building blocks , the 1-solitons .",
    "if the space @xmath2 is replaced by a cylinder @xmath4 the picture is not so simple : there may be more than one topological charge , while the 1-solitons from the original theory may break up into smaller objects .",
    "the most well - studied case is that of calorons @xcite in yang - mills theory on @xmath5 . while a caloron sometimes resembles a collection of instantons on a cylinder ,",
    "it is more correctly thought of as a superposition of fundamental monopoles , since instantons may be separated into monopoles , but the converse is not true .",
    "moreover , there is not just @xmath6 , but @xmath7 different types of fundamental monopole , @xmath7 being the rank of the gauge group @xmath1 .    as a general rule ,",
    "instantons in @xmath1 yang - mills theory are similar to the so - called `` lumps '' of the @xmath8 sigma models .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that lumps on a cylinder @xmath9 ( or `` chains '' ) will have similar properties to calorons . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", bruckmann has constructed an example of a chain in the @xmath10 sigma model which exhibits constituents in much the same way as calorons . here",
    "we extend bruckmann s analysis to @xmath0 sigma models .",
    "further aspects of @xmath0 chains are explored in another new article @xcite . after completing this work",
    ", we learned that similar constructions also appeared in the earlier paper @xcite .",
    "it is worth asking why constituents were not discovered in sigma models earlier .",
    "in fact , there has been a number of studies of chains in sigma models .",
    "the reason constituents were not observed is that the constituents are only visible if the periodic boundary condition is accompanied by a suitable `` twist '' ; this is entirely analogous to the condition of `` non - trivial holonomy '' which is necessary for constituent monopoles to be observed in calorons .",
    "a number of explanations have been put forward for the constituent structure of calorons .",
    "the earliest can be found in the work of garland and murray , who , following a suggestion of hitchin , showed that a caloron can be identified with a monopole on @xmath11 whose gauge group is a loop group @xcite .",
    "then the different types of constituent in a caloron can be associated with the roots of the loop group , just as an @xmath1 monopole exhibits constituents associated with the roots of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "unaware of this earlier work , lee and yi later predicted the existence of constituents using a string - theoretic argument , and this paper motivated the explicit constructions of @xcite .",
    "the nahm transform for calorons is also suggestive of a constituent structure , as noted by kraan and van baal @xcite .",
    "however , the link between constituents and nahm transforms is not universal : monopole chains have both constituents and a nahm transform @xcite , but there is no clear link between the two .",
    "prior to the explicit constructions @xcite , chains in the @xmath0 sigma models were predicted to exhibit constituents by tong @xcite , using string theory arguments similar to lee and yi s .",
    "tong s argument actually applied to semi - local vortices , which approach sigma model lumps in a strong coupling limit , and motivated the paper @xcite . here , we will show that , like the constituent monopoles of a caloron , the constituents of a sigma model chain can also be understood classically , using loop groups . unlike in calorons , consituents in sigma model chains can not be understood using a nahm transform , since no nahm transform for sigma models is known @xcite .",
    "an outline of the rest of this article is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly recall the definition of the @xmath0 sigma models . in section 3 , we review and analyse the sigma - model analog of monopoles , which we have called `` multi - kinks '' , and which were previously studied in @xcite . in section 4",
    "we construct and analyse chains in the sigma models . in section 5",
    "we review some facts about loop groups , and in section 6 we show how these can be used to understand the constituent structure of chains .",
    "we conclude with some comments in section 7 .",
    "the field content of a sigma model is a map @xmath12 between two manifolds equipped with metrics @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and induced volume forms @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the energy functional is @xmath17 here , and throughout , we use the shorthand notation @xmath18 in the mathematical literature , a function @xmath19 which minimizes @xmath20 is called harmonic . in the case where @xmath21 is a riemannian 2-manifold and",
    "@xmath3 is khler with khler form @xmath22 , there is a lower bound @xmath23 called the bogomolny bound , which is saturated if and only if @xmath19 is holomorphic @xcite .",
    "the lower bound is homotopy - invariant",
    ".    we will be interested in the case where @xmath21 is @xmath24 and @xmath3 is @xmath7-dimensional complex projective space @xmath0 . the simplest way to define",
    "this space is as a quotient : @xmath25 . in practise",
    ", we will use two models for this space .",

    "we represent points in @xmath0 by non - zero column vectors with square brackets , and column vectors related by a rescaling are understood to be equivalent : @xmath36 \\sim \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\kappa z^1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\",

    "a disadvantage of this representation is that it can be tricky to evaluate the energy density of a given field @xmath19 .",
    "one must first use the rescaling ( [ rescaling ] ) to ensure @xmath19 takes values in @xmath41 , and then evaluate the @xmath42 using the quotient metric on @xmath43 .",
    "the quotient metric agrees with ( [ metric ] ) when @xmath41 is defined by @xmath44 .",
    "thankfully , we will rarely need to evaluate energy densities in what follows .",
    "multi - kinks were introduced in @xcite , and are the sigma model analog of monopoles .",

    "we may choose coordinates so that @xmath61 for real numbers @xmath62 satisfying @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we assume further that these inequalities are strict : this is analogous to the condition of maximal symmetry breaking for monopoles . in order that the energy be finite",

    "if @xmath80 is a cartan subalgebra of @xmath27 , then a cartan subalgebra for the lie algebra of @xmath233 is obtained by adding the generator @xmath257 of @xmath231 .",
    "the roots are denoted @xmath265 , where @xmath266 , @xmath112 is a root of @xmath27 or zero , and @xmath267 ; their action is @xmath268 for @xmath269 , and @xmath270",
    ". there are @xmath66 simple roots , given by @xmath271 the dynkin diagrams of lie groups @xmath26 and the corresponding loop groups are depicted in figure [ dynkin ] .",
    "we are now ready to elucidate the root structure associated with chains",
    ". we shall show that a @xmath0 chain is the same thing as a multi - kink in a sigma model whose target is the loop space @xmath234 .",
    "let @xmath19 be a chain satisfying @xmath272 . define a map @xmath273 by @xmath274",
    "making this reparametrisation is a little like changing the gauge of a caloron from the algebraic gauge ( where the component of the gauge field in the periodic direction @xmath275 vanishes at infinity and the caloron is periodic up to a gauge transformation ) to a gauge where @xmath275 is non - zero at infinity and the caloron is strictly periodic ( eg the polyakov gauge ) @xcite .    the bogomolny equation for @xmath19 , @xmath276 is equivalent to @xmath277 this is formally identical to the bogomolny equation for a multi - kink ( [ dw bog equation ] ) , since @xmath278 is an element of the lie algebra of @xmath279 .",
    "similarly , the energy functional for @xmath19 is equal to @xmath280 where the potential function @xmath281 is equal to the norm squared of the vector field induced on @xmath234 by @xmath282 .",
    "here we are using the metric defined in ( [ loop metric ] ) .    identifying chains with @xmath234 kinks",
    "explains the constituent structure of chains identified earlier .",
    "just as the @xmath7 fundamental kinks of a multi - kink were identified with the @xmath7 simple roots of @xmath26 , so too are the @xmath214 fundamental kinks of a chain identified with the @xmath214 simple roots of @xmath279 .",
    "notice too that the masses @xmath141 of the fundamental kinks are in this case proportional to @xmath283 , analagous to ( [ mass formula ] ) .    as a concrete example",

    "the horizontal axis represents the cartan sub - algebra @xmath80 of @xmath145 and the vertical axis represents the lie algebra of @xmath231 .",
    "the orbit of @xmath285 is @xmath286 .",

    "in this article , we have explored the connection between chains and multi - kinks in sigma models . we were able to construct explicitly all solutions to the appropriate bogomolny equations , with our choice of boundary conditions .",
    "we showed how the constituent structure of both can be understood using the structure theory of lie algebras ; for the case of chains , the relevant lie algebra was associated with a loop group .",
    "the constituents provide a simple physical picture of multi - kinks and chains : the number of moduli can be accounted for by assigning a position and a phase modulus to each constituent , while the total mass is equal to the sums of the masses of all of the constituents .",
    "the dimensions of the moduli spaces of chains are completely determined in a simple way by the topological charges and boundary conditions imposed .",
    "we have demonstrated this by constructing all solutions explicitly , but for other solitons ( for example instantons , calorons and monopoles ) the dimension of the moduli space is known without existence of explicit solutions .",
    "it would be interesting to know whether the dimensions of moduli spaces could be related to the topology more directly , for example by using an index theorem .",
    "we point out here that sigma models have been studied in connection with loop groups before .",
    "atiyah has demonstrated the existence of a bijection between moduli spaces of @xmath1 yang - mills instantons and moduli spaces of lumps in sigma models with target @xmath287 @xcite , while charbonneau and hurtubise have explored a similar correspondence for calorons .",
    "we have discovered many similarities between @xmath0 sigma model chains and @xmath26-calorons .",
    "most notable are the charge formula ( [ caloron charge ] ) , which resembles the formula for calorons , and the ordering prescription among consituents of a chain , which mirrors an ordering prescripition among the constituent monopoles @xmath227-symmetric calorons .",
    "the latter might have an explanation via atiyah s result , particularly as atiyah s paper focuses on the case of @xmath227 symmetry , and exploits loop groups .",
    "however , we have not succeeded in finding a direct link ; the main problem is that atiyah s target space @xmath288 does not coincide with our target space @xmath234 .",
