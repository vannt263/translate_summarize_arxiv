    "batteries have been the focus of intense scrutiny in recent years .",
    "this research is driven by specialized requirements for energy storage , e.g. , capabilities for high current for automotive purposes , high capacity batteries to buffer disparities in supply and demand for the power grid , and high energy density for batteries used in portable electronic devices.@xcite much effort is directed toward studying rechargeable lithium batteries,@xcite as that is the preferred base material due to the high energy densities achievable , its good cyclability properties , a high working voltage , and its abundance in the earth s crust .",
    "numerical modeling flanks experimental work in the goal to optimize batteries .",
    "traditionally , macro - homogeneous modeling uses diffusive processes through porous material to describe batteries on a mesoscale ( i.e. , smaller than the electrode , larger than a molecule ) , and adds charge and mass balance equations as well as transfer kinetics across the boundary surfaces.@xcite such simulations very successfully reproduce the macroscopic behavior of batteries , and can be used to optimize parameters such as electrode thickness .",
    "mesoscopic porous electrode models form the basis for the li - ion battery module for instance in the commercial comsol multi - physics simulation package . however",
    ", some of the underlying assumptions of this approach can be considered `` uncertain at best.''@xcite    mesoscale modeling requires constitutive equations .",
    "it is possible to input a great many effects based on parameterized experimental data into such descriptions .",
    "those include , but are not limited to , ionic and electronic conductivities , specific surface areas , tortuosities , porosities , activity coefficients , transference numbers , concentrations , diffusion coefficients , current densities , electrochemical potential , reaction rate constants , solid electrolyte interface transport processes , contact resistances between active material and current collector , and mechanical properties such as strain tensors , elastic moduli or fracture strengths.@xcite unfortunately , this parameterizability which makes the approach suitable to describe real batteries also limits its general predictive power , especially on the nanoscale .    in recent molecular dynamics ( md ) works , on the other hand ,",
    "much effort has been devoted to dealing with certain aspects of battery design in detail .",
    "examples are plentiful and include improving the intercalation of lithium into graphite , or calculating the transport properties of lithium through various electrode materials .",
    "@xcite in contrast to mesoscale models , md simulations tackle micro- and nano - physical aspects of the problem ( typically only considering half - cells ) , but can not make macroscopic predictions on , for instance , how the voltage during discharge changes under the influence of various control parameters such as temperature , discharge current , or changes of cell geometry .",
    "standard md methods  based on either conventional _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) or traditional _ charge equilibration _ ( qe )  @xcite  can not be used to model a battery as a whole , because those seek to equalize the chemical potential . however , the difference in the chemical potential between two electrodes is precisely what drives charge transport in a battery .",
    "furthermore , both approaches are ill - suited to model history - dependent effects .",
    "the reason is that they carry out a unique energy minimization based on instantaneous nuclear positions . the electron transfer process during a redox reaction brings about a quasi - discontinuous change of the electronic state , modifying all molecular orbitals,@xcite while the atomic configuration remains virtually unaltered .    time - dependent dft ( tddft )  @xcite can elucidate history dependence to some degree .",
    "however , this is expensive computationally , and , more severely , conceptual difficulties remain .",
    "they pertain to ( a ) setting up a meaningful initial state with the correct voltage between anode and cathode , and ( b ) reproducing correct level hopping due to an overestimation of the long - range polarizability in current dft schemes . the application of tddft , and similarly _ ab initio _",
    "md , to electrochemical processes with regards to batteries has been limited.@xcite    recently , it was proposed that the limitations of md calculations can be mitigated by introducing the oxidation state as a time - dependent variable , which needs to be subjected to dynamics.@xcite in addition to exchanging partial charges as in the standard _",

    "method,@xcite atoms can then change their ionization state ( i.e. , participate in a redox reaction ) by swapping integer charges across a bond ( integer charge transfer ",
    "hereafter , the method is referred to as the redox split - charge equilibration ( redoxsqe ) method .    in a previous work,@xcite we applied redoxsqe to case studies of contact electrification between two clusters of ideal metals and ideal dielectrics , respectively .",
    "if two initially neutral clusters with differing electron affinities are brought into contact , they will exchange charge . after separation",
    ", some portion of the transferred charge does not flow back , generating a remnant electric field that was not present before the contact .",
    "neither conventional qe methods nor ( non - time - dependent ) dft can capture this history - dependence .",
    "redoxsqe in contrast , successfully produces charge hysteresis effects during approach and retraction , despite identical atomic positions .    in this paper",
    "we apply the redoxsqe method to a more complex problem .",
    "we want to bridge the gap between the mesoscale and highly accurate ( dft , accurate force field ) approaches , and model a nano - battery .",
    "if properly parameterized , redoxsqe can be used to model the microphysics at both electrode - electrolyte interfaces , including their structural evolution and changing morphology , as well as battery performance degradation . at this stage ,",
    "the simulations are meant to serve as proof - of - concept , rather than emulate any real system or produce new quantitative insights . however , even at its present qualitative level , our model reproduces generic features of battery discharge .",
    "we believe that redoxsqe can be parameterized to describe real materials quantitatively , because unmodified sqe combined with rebo ( reactive empirical bond - order ) force fields has yielded good agreement with experimental and dft results ( heats of formation of isolated molecules , radial distribution functions for water and ethanol , and energies of oxygenated diamond surfaces ) for systems in which each element had a well - defined oxidation state.@xcite    this paper is structured as follows .",

    "the symbols @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote bond parameters , constant for each bond type . in this paper the plateau value @xmath23 , because we are primarily concerned with metallic contacts .",

    "our parameterization of the bond hardness smoothly approaches @xmath21 at the lower threshold , while it diverges at the upper threshold , where the bond breaks . at both thresholds ,",
    "the force brought about by the distance - dependence of the bond hardness has a cusp , which may lead to very small drifts in the total energy .",
    "this is discussed in detail in the previous work.@xcite      prior to calculating the coulomb force and the md step , in the so - called equilibration step , we update all split charges on `` active '' bonds for a fixed atomic configuration .",
    "a bond is classified as `` active '' if its bond hardness is zero or finite ( but not infinite ) , i.e. if the bond length @xmath28 .",
    "inactive bonds do not carry partial charges .",
    "we minimize the potential energy with respect to the split charge distribution by solving the homogeneous linear system of equations @xmath29 with a steepest - descent solver.@xcite the potential @xmath30 is that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sqe_potential ] ) .",
    "typically , the minimization requires only a handful of iterations .",
    "however , following an integer charge transfer ( see sec .  [",
    "subsec : ict ] ) , up to several thousand iterations can be necessary to find the split charge distribution minimizing the energy .",
    "next , we update the total charge on each atom according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : q_from_sqs ] ) , based on the atomic integer charges carried , and the bond charges , and proceed with the normal md calculation .    for the battery simulations shown below , we only allow split - charge ( and integer - charge ) exchange between electrode atoms .",
    "electrolyte atoms are modeled as fixed - charge particles .",
    "the novel feature of redoxsqe is that it allows for integer charge transfer ( ict ) besides the exchange of partial charges across dielectric bonds.@xcite this section briefly describes the implementation , while sec .",
    "[ subsec : ictm ] explains how we treat charge transfer across metallic bonds .    at each time step , we select all `` dielectric '' bonds with @xmath31 , i.e. , any pair of atoms that is sufficiently close together to share a split charge , but not close enough to have a vanishing bond hardness ( `` metallic '' bonds ) .",
    "we also exclude electrolyte atoms from participating in icts because they are assumed to be unreactive with the electrode for maximum battery efficiency.@xcite furthermore , our nave implementation sets hard limits on the oxidation state for each atom type  in the simulations presented below we do not allow double ionization .",
    "more sophisticated rules are conceivable , but left for future work .    for each eligible bond , we draw a random number between zero and one , uniformly distributed .",
    "if it is smaller than a certain threshold ( somewhat arbitrarily chosen @xmath32 ) , an ict is attempted .",
    "this is to approximate the electron transfer rate . in more realistic simulations",
    ", this rate must be determined from quantum - chemical calculations . for a trial ict ,",
    "we increment or decrement the integer charge ( i.e. , the oxidation state ) of each participating atom by one elementary charge , with the algebraic sign the same as the sign of the split charge between the two atoms .",
    "then we re - equilibrate the partial charges , and calculate the system s total potential energy . if the charge transfer has lowered the energy ( i.e. , the system now evolves on a landau - zener level with strictly lower energy ) , the move is accepted , otherwise it is rejected and the original state restored .",
    "a modification in future code implementations will be be to accept icts according to some metropolis - type condition instead.@xcite then , the energy can also increase with a certain probability during an ict , fulfilling the principle of detailed balance , and producing the correct equilibrium distributions . in our current model",
    "we expect that the metropolis algorithm mainly changes the dynamics near the transition state , i.e. , the reorganization of the solvent might take longer due to back jumps .",
    "however , the final state will not be altered because fluctuations of solvated ions to become neutral are extremely rare events .    besides changing the oxidation state",
    ", an ict also changes the atom type .",
    "this is necessary because an ion may have different atomic properties ( such as radius and interaction parameters ) as well as bond characteristics from its neutral counterpart .",
    "the type change necessitates also taking into account the short - range interaction energy for the ict .",
    "an electrode atom only changes its type if it gains the `` correct '' charge .",
    "the opposite charge is absorbed by , and distributed across , metallic bonds , e.g. , among connected remaining electrode atoms .",
    "for the anode , this means that an atom is stripped of a negative integer charge ( i.e. , one or more electrons ) , and becomes a cation ( i.e. , it changes from atom type 1 into type 3 ) , while the negative charge remains on the anode .",
    "it serves to compensate for the positive charge accumulated by sending negative charge through the external resistor .",
    "while the net positive charge is localized on the cation , the remnant negative charge is distributed across the entire anode as split charges instantaneously , even though _ formally _ there is still _ one particular _ anode atom that carries the charge via its oxidation state , for book keeping .",
    "conversely at the cathode , adsorbed cations receive negative integer charges transferred from the anode and are neutralized ( they change from atom type 4 to type 2 ) , as their surplus net positive charge is absorbed .",
    "in addition to the procedure described above , we draw another random number and only proceed with the trial ict if this exceeds some threshold ( for instance @xmath33 , to attempt an ict only every tenth md step ) , in order to alleviate a bias introduced by the order in which we query bonds .",
    "this results in two trial icts per atomic oscillation period , on average . in future implementations we will randomize the order of bonds for which we attempt an ict , and fully eliminate the bias .",
    "all in all , the maximum number of attempted icts per md time step is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of redox - active atoms , @xmath36 is their average coordination number , and @xmath37 is the fraction of icts that passed picking the second random number ( e.g. @xmath38 ) .",
    "lastly , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the fraction of dielectrically bonded atoms .",
    "the factor is @xmath41 for atoms dissolved in redox - inert solvent ( e.g. , in the electrolyte ) , and @xmath42 in clusters of redox - active material .      for a `` metallic '' bond with @xmath43 , the backflow of partial charge",
    "exactly compensates the transfer of integer charge .",
    "such a move would always be accepted because the energy is unchanged , but would still cause an expensive yet unnecessary re - equilibration of split charges .",
    "in addition to the integer charge transfer across a `` dielectric '' bond with finite bond hardness , we therefore implement a second mode of ict that applies to metallic bonds .",
    "we call such an operation ictm .",
    "we implement ictms such that we draw a random number for each metallic bond between two atoms otherwise eligible of an ict .",
    "if this number exceeds a threshold , an integer charge is swapped , and immediately compensated by an equal split charge transfer in the opposite direction .",
    "together , those transfers are energetically neutral moves in a metal .",
    "no sqe needs to be performed , and no type change occurs , so no further computations are needed .",
    "ictms thereby allow for `` oxidation state diffusion . ''",
    "if the integer charge get transferred onto the `` front atoms '' in the anode ( the atom connected to the wire , see sec .",
    "[ subsec : ext_resistor ] below ) , we do not allow it to move away anymore .",
    "i.e. , the total charge after adding the `` external '' split charge ( connected via resistor to the other electrode ) .",
    "] as a consequence , all free negative integer charges ( which could be interpreted as electrons ) eventually migrate to the front atom , and are sent across the external resistor , in accordance with the real physical process .",
    "similarly , negative integer charges emanate from the cathode s front atom and diffuse toward cations adsorbed to the electrode surface .",
    "ictm happens as next - neighbor hopping .",
    "it would be more meaningful if a metal cluster as a whole had an excess of integer charge ( positive or negative ) , rather than individual atoms in a metal cluster being assigned an oxidation state .",
    "this would also reproduce realistic physics more faithfully by allowing an immediate transfer of integer charges between any two atoms connected to a metallic cluster .",
    "however , for bookkeeping and domain decomposition reasons , we stick to the current procedure , eliminating the overhead of a cluster analysis .",
    "we emphasize that during an ictm , only negative integer charges can diffuse through the electrodes .",
    "it is _ not _",
    "possible for two initially neutral metal atoms to assume the configuration + 1/-1 , in contrast to the ict in dielectrics , because one of the two atoms changes its type in such a case .    also note that the random number is necessary to reduce ( albeit not fully avoid ) spurious directed motion .",
    "we perform the scan for the ictm deterministically ( e.g. , atom @xmath14 is always queried before atom @xmath44 ) , and therefore would introduce a preferred transfer order if every move was accepted .",

    "both metallic and ionic species are visualized as much bigger than electrolyte atoms are .",
    "the latter are + 1/-1 fixed - charge particles , but their charge coloring is halved , again for better contrast .",
    "the medium - sized particles are cations , while the largest particles are metallic atoms .",
    "those may or may not carry a negative oxidation state , as negative integer charges can hop freely across metallic bonds in an ictm ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : ictm ] ) .",
    "the anode in this simulation initially held 5 layers of atoms ; all atoms of the rightmost layer have undergone redox reactions , each donated a negative integer charge to the anode , and subsequently dissolved as a cation ( roughly 45 atoms in total in this picture ) .",
    "the other layers are still in the middle of this process , and are only partially dissolved .",
    "the anode is positively charged , partly as a result of polarization charges as consequence of the layer of anionic electrolyte particles that wet its surface , and partly because insufficient atoms have dissolved as cations to carry away its excess charge . as expected for a metal , the charges reside primarily on the bulk surface  @xcite .",
    "the cathode started out with only the single fixed layer at the beginning of the simulation , but in this snapshot , about 75 pre - dissolved cations in the right half - cell have already adsorbed , donated their charge , and become part of the metallic cathode .",
    "this process is not homogeneous , the accretion occurs in clusters and produces an uneven surface with fractal - like features .",
    "if redoxsqe is properly parameterized for real materials , it can be useful in the quest to understand the detailed morphology and structure of the surface layer , as well as phenomena such as dendrite formation,@xcite because it resolves the electrode - electrolyte interface .",
    "it may also be useful for intercalation studies of lithium into graphite .    besides some minor polarization charges , the cathode is neutral overall because adsorbed cations have contributed sufficient charges to compensate for the negative charge that has traveled along the connection through the external resistor @xmath45 ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : ext_resistor ] ) .",
    "the external load is implemented as a dedicated partial charge between an atom in the fixed layer of either electrode .",

    "[ subsec : sqe ] ) but receives its value according to ohm s law ( if the switch is closed ) : @xmath47 where @xmath45 is the constant external resistance , and @xmath48 is the instantaneous driving voltage between the two connected front atoms .",
    "the separator only allows electrolyte particles to pass through , all others experience a repulsive force ( see sec .",
