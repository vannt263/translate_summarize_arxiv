    "more than twenty five years have passed since the discovery of pulsars and there is still no consensus on the basic emission mechanism . at the present time",
    ", there are about a dozen competing theories which differ both in the physical effects responsible for the radiation and in the locations where they operate ( @xcite ) .",
    "probably the only point of agreement between all these theories is the association of pulsars with magnetized , rotating neutron stars .",
    "by contrast , there is so much observational data available that none of the existing theories can explain all the _ main _ observational facts .",
    "there are several reasons that have precluded understanding of pulsar radio emission .",
    "first , there is the unusual physical conditions found in pulsar magnetospheres ( relativistic electron - positron plasma , superstrong magnetic fields , ultrarelativistic beam ) .",
    "secondly , only a small fraction of the energy lost by a neutron star is re - emitted in the radio ( even in the high energy range , where a considerable portion of energy is emitted , there is still no consensus on the origin of this emission , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the third reason is that after thirty years of research , we still do not know the general structure of a pulsar magnetosphere ( @xcite ) .",
    "we understand only particular features , like the existence of open and closed field lines and where electric field can be parallel to the magnetic field .    to date , the most widely discussed theory attributes the emission to coherent curvature emission by bunches of particles .",
    "though this theory can explain a broad range of observed pulsar properties by the careful arrangement of the magnetic field geometry and of the form and size of bunches , thirty years of theoretical efforts have failed to explain the origin of these bunches ( @xcite ) .",
    "this theory can also be ruled out on the observational grounds ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the work of @xcite we note , that this theory also fails to explain the observed correlations of the conal peaks @xcite and a large size of the emitting region @xcite ( see section [ observational properties ] ) .",
    "we propose that the pulsar radiation is generated by _",
    "plasma instabilities _ developing in the outflowing plasma on the open field lines of the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "plasma can be considered as an active medium that can amplify its normal modes . in the case of the two instabilities discussed below",
    ", the wave amplification is due to the _ resonant _ wave - particle interaction , i.e. , in the rest frame of the particle the frequency of the resonant wave is zero or a multiple of the gyrational frequency .",
    "the plasma instabilities that we argue operate in the pulsar magnetosphere may be described by the ( somewhat contradictory ) term `` incoherent broadband maser '' .",
    "each single emission by a charged particle is due to the stimulated , as opposed to spontaneous , emission process ( hereby the term maser ) . unlike the conventional lasers in which basically one single frequency gets amplified , in this case charged particles can resonate with many mutually incoherent waves with different frequencies .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a theory of pulsar radio emission developed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we hypothesize , that pulsar radiation is generated by the instabilities developing in the outflowing plasma on the open field lines in the outer regions of the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "radiation is generated by two kinds of _ electromagnetic _ plasma instabilities  cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift instabilities .",
    "the cyclotron - cherenkov instability is responsible for the generation of the core - type emission and the cherenkov - drift instability is responsible for the generation of the cone - type emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "the waves generated by these instabilities are vacuum - like electromagnetic waves so that they may leave magnetosphere the directly .",
    "in contrast to most modern theories of pulsar radio emission , cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift instabilities occur in the outer parts of magnetosphere .",
    "the location of the emission region is determined by the corresponding resonant condition for the cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift instabilities .",
    "instabilities develop in a limited region on the open field lines .",
    "the size of the emission region is determined by the curvature of the magnetic field lines , which limits the length of the resonant wave - particle interaction .",
    "the location of the cyclotron - cherenkov instability is restricted to those field lines with large radius of curvature , while the cherenkov - drift instability occurs on field lines with curvature bounded both from above and from below .",
    "thus , both instabilities produce narrow pulses , though they operate at radii where the opening angle of the open field lines is large .    to a large extent a possible mechanism for the generation of pulsar radio emission is predicated on the choice of parameters of the plasma flow that is generated by a rotating neutron star . at this point we know only the general features of the distribution function of the particles in a pulsar magnetosphere ( @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is believed to comprise ( see fig .",
    "[ distributionfunction ] ) ( i ) a highly relativistic primary beam with the lorentz factor @xmath4 and density equal to the goldreich - julian density @xmath5 , ( ii ) a secondary electron positron plasma with a bulk streaming lorentz factor @xmath6 , a similar scatter in energy @xmath7 and a density much larger than the beam density @xmath8 , ( iii ) a tail of plasma distribution with the energy up to @xmath9 .",
    "the choice of a particular distribution function ( fig .",
    "[ distributionfunction ] ) is very important .",
    "all the following is dependent on this choice . in particular , in our model",
    ", the primary beam is composed of electrons or positrons .",
    "we show in appendix [ instabilityion ] that both cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift instabilities do not develop in an ion beam .",
    "the _ electromagnetic _ cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift instabilities are the strongest instabilities in the pulsar magnetosphere ( @xcite ) .",
    "this differs from the more common case of a nonrelativistic plasma , where electrostatic cherenkov - type instabilities ( i.e. those that result in emission of electrostatic langmuir - type waves ) are generally stronger than electromagnetic instabilities .",
    "in addition , for a one - dimensional plasma streaming along the magnetic field , the effective parallel mass is considerably increased by relativistic effects . for the particles in the primary beam , which contribute to the development of the instability ,",
    "the effective parallel mass is @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is a mass of a particle ) .",
    "this suppresses the development of the electrostatic instabilities .",
    "in contrast , the effective transverse mass , @xmath12 , is less affected by the large parallel momentum .",
    "the electromagnetic instabilities are less suppressed by the large streaming momenta .",
    "thus , the relativistic velocities and one - dimensionality of the distribution function result in a strong suppression of the electrostatic instabilities and strengthen electromagnetic instabilities .    cyclotron - cherenkov generation of wave by fast particles is not new in astrophysics .",
    "for example , cosmic rays in the interstellar medium and in supernova shocks generate alfvn by a similar mechanism . in the case of alfvn waves in the nonrelativistic electron - ion plasma ,",
    "the frequency of the waves @xmath13 can be much smaller than the @xmath14 term and can be neglected in the resonance condition .",
    "the important difference between these applications and cyclotron - cherenkov instability in pulsar magnetosphere is that the generated waves belong not to the hydromagnetic alfvn waves , that can not leave the plasma , but to near vacuum electromagnetic waves .",
    "we should also mention that a cyclotron - cherenkov instability of an electron beam propagating along a magnetic field is known in the laboratory as a very effective source of the high frequency microwave radio emission ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the so called slow - wave electron cyclotron masers ( ecm ) provides a high efficiency and high power microwave source .",
    "though there are no commercial slow - wave ecm available now , they are believed to be very promising devices due to their better control of the beam quality and potentially more compact design than the cyclotron autoresonance masers .",
    "thus , pulsars can be regarded as cosmic slow - wave ecms .    in previous work ( @xcite )",
    "we developed a new approach to the amplification of curvature radiation . we argue , that a new , cherenkov - drift instability , may be operational in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the cherenkov - drift emission combines the features of both cherenkov and curvature emission processes .",
    "this instability is similar to the drift instabilities of the inhomogeneous plasma .",
    "the striking feature is that , unlike the nonrelativistic laboratory plasma , where drift instabilities develop on the low frequency waves with the wave length on the order of the inhomogeneity size , in the strong relativistic plasma drift instabilities can produce high frequency waves .",
    "we develop an approach that treat cherenkov and curvature emission consistently in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the choice of cylindrical coordinates allows one to consider curvature emission as a resonant emission process .",
    "( in the former approaches the wave - particles interaction length was very limited , that precluded a strong amplification under all circumstances ) .",
    "another important difference in this work is the proper account of the dispersion and polarization of the normal modes .",
    "we show that cherenkov - drift instability develops only in a medium which supports subluminous waves .",
    "we argue that the theory based on the cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift instabilities is capable of explaining a very broad range of the pulsars observed properties . in a `` standard '' pulsar with a surface magnetic field @xmath15 and a period @xmath16 s both cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift instabilities",
    "occur at a radius of about @xmath17 cm . in a dipole geometry the emission region",
    "is limited to the field lines near the direction of the magnetic moment of the neutron star .",
    "the emission region for the cherenkov - drift instability is larger than for the cyclotron - cherenkov instability . in both cases",
    "it is determined by the curvature of the magnetic field lines that limit the coherent growth of the waves .    in section [ observational properties ] we shortly review the observational properties of the pulsar radio emission . in section [ instabilities ]",
    "we discuss the microphysics of the underlying cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift instabilities . in section [ model ]",
    "we describe the fiducial pulsar model , and finally in section [ pulsarphenomenology ] we show how the properties of the pulsar radio emission may be explained in the framework of this theory .",
    "a useful observational framework for discussing theory is a description of pulsar radio emission given by @xcite .",
    "the main feature of this model is the division of emission into two main classes : core and cone .",
    "there may be many cones of emission . in each pulsar",
    "the averaged profile may be a combination of core and/or cone emissions ( fig .",
    "[ emissiongeometry ] ) .",
    "the majority of pulsars ( about 70@xmath18 ) show core - type emission .",
    "the typical core emission has the following features : ( a ) the profile has a single component , ( b ) variable circular polarization ( up to 60@xmath18 ) , the amount of the circular polarization either reaches maximum at the maximum intensity or the sense of polarization may reverse in the middle of the pulse ( fig .",
    "emissiongeometry ) , ( c ) linear polarization changes from nearly 100@xmath18 to unpolarized , in most cases the radiation may be split into two orthogonally polarized modes ( @xcite ) .",
    "about 30@xmath18 of all pulsars show pure conal emission and they are divided into two main groups  cone singles and cone doubles which are believed to be closely connected , the only difference being the geometrical path of the line of sight through emission region .",
    "conal type emission shows a great variety of phenomena .",
    "some of the typical features of conal emission are ( a ) the profiles can have up to four components , corresponding to two cones , ( b ) circular polarization is small and unsystematic , ( c ) linear polarization is moderate , some pulsars show a sudden change of position angle by @xmath19 ; in most cases the radiation may be split into two orthogonally polarized modes , then the change of position angle by @xmath19 corresponds to the change in the relative intensity of the modes .",
    "besides these phenomena , cone - type emission shows drifting subpulses , nullings and mode switching .",
    "these effects are probably related to the temporal and/or spatial modulations of the parameters of the outflowing plasma and will not be discused here ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there have been contradictory attempts to determine observationally the emission altitude but this conclusion is model - dependent .",
    "by contrast , @xcite used interstellar scattering to measure directly the size of the emission region of @xmath20 km ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the other , model - dependent , observational evidences for high emission altitudes comes from the large duty cycles often observed in pulsars ( `` wide beam pulsars '' , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "conventionally , these pulsars are interpreted as almost aligned rotators .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the emission may be coming from large radii .",
    "another class of pulsars , those with interpulses , are conventionally interpreted as orthogonal rotators with emission coming from two poles despite the fact that emission bridges are often observed in these pulsars @xcite and , at least in one case , psr b0950 + 08 the polarization data imply a nearly aligned rotator ( @xcite ) .",
    "the crab pulsar also has a bridge of emission between the two pulses , intensities of the main pulse and interpulse are correlated and the angle of linear polarization in the two pulses seems to be related .",
    "in addition , it shows additional emission peaks _ between _ the interpulse and pulse at centimeter wave length @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggests that interpulses come from the same pole .",
    "if so , the simplest interpretation is that emission originates at high altitudes .",
    "in this section we consider the physics of the cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift instabilities ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the terminology used here to describe these instabilities refers to the fact that in the cyclotron - cherenkov emission , a resonant particle changes its gyrational state ( undergoes a transition between different landau level ) , thereby comes the `` cyclotron '' part of its name , but the force that induces the emission is due to the presence of a medium ( the `` cherenkov '' part of the name ) .",
    "the cherenkov - drift emission is similar to conventional cherenkov ( the gyrational state of the resonant particle remains unchanged ) but it involves a nonvanishing curvature drift of the resonant particles .",
    "the interplay between cyclotron ( or synchrotron ) and cherenkov radiation has been a long - standing matter of interest .",
    "@xcite discussed the relation between these two seemingly different emission mechanisms .",
    "they showed that conventional synchrotron emission and cherenkov radiation may be regarded as respectively limiting cases of @xmath22 and @xmath23 of a synergetic ( using the terminology of schwinger _",
    "@xcite ) cyclotron - cherenkov radiation . in the work ( @xcite this analogy has been extended to include inhomogeneity of the magnetic field .",
    "the physical origin of the emission in the case of cherenkov - type and synchrotron - type processes is quite different . in the case of cherenkov - type process",
    ", the emission may be attributed to the electromagnetic polarization shock front that develops in a dielectric medium due to the passage of a charged particle with speed larger than phase speed of waves in a medium .",
    "it is virtually a collective emission process . in the case of synchrotron - type process",
    ", the emission may be attributed to the lorentz force acting on a particle in a magnetic field .",
    "cherenkov - type emission is impossible in vacuum and in a medium with the refractive index smaller than unity .",
    "both the cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift instabilities , that we believe can develop in pulsar magnetosphere , operate in the kinetic regime , i.e. they are of a maser type ( @xcite ) .",
    "this means that there is some kind of population inversion in the phase space , which supplies the energy for the development of the instability . in the present case , the source of free energy is the anisotropic distribution function of the fast particles .",
    "the condition of a population inversion may be restated that the induced emission dominates over induced absorption for a given transition .",
    "the first two steps in identifying the possible maser - type radio emission generation mechanism are ( i ) determining which radiative transitions are allowed in a given system and ( ii ) establishing if the given distribution function allows for the population inversion for the particle in resonance with the emitted waves . in this chapter",
    "we will first discuss the microphysics of the two suggested emission mechanisms and then show that the distribution function of the particles present on the open field lines of pulsar magnetosphere does have a population inversion and allows maser action . when discussing the microphysics of the emission process",
    ", we will concentrate on the spontaneous emission processes .",
    "the induced emission rate , which is important for the development of the instabilities , is derivable from the spontaneous emission in the usual manner . in the process of induced emission ,",
    "the electron emits a wave in phase with the incident wave .",
    "however , both cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift masers are broadband and incoherent because a single electron can resonate with several waves simultaneously .",
    "the cyclotron - cherenkov instability develops at the anomalous cyclotron resonance @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the frequency of the normal mode , @xmath26 is a wave vector , @xmath27 is the velocity of the resonant particle , @xmath28 is the nonrelativistic gyrofrequency , @xmath29 is the lorentz factor in the pulsar frame , @xmath30 is the charge of the resonant particle , @xmath31 is its mass and @xmath32 is the speed of light . note a sign before the @xmath33 term .    to describe the microphysics of the cyclotron - cherenkov emission emission process we first recall the microphysics of the conventional cherenkov emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "consider a charged particle propagating in an unmagnetized dielectric with the dielectric constant @xmath34 .",
    "as the particle propagates , it induces a polarization in a medium . if the velocity of the particle is larger than the velocity of propagation of the polarization disturbances in a medium , which is equal to the phase speed of the waves @xmath35 , the induced polarization can not keep up with the particle .",
    "this results in a formation of the polarization shock front . at large distances , the electromagnetic fields from this `` shock front ''",
    "have a wave - like form corresponding to cherenkov emission .",
    "thus the emission is attributed to the polarization shock front and not directly to the particle .",
    "this polarization shock front acts on the particle with a drag force , which slows down the particle .",
    "this drag force may be considered as a generalization of the radiation reaction force in a medium .",
    "now let us consider the propagation of a particle in a magnetized dielectric along a spiral trajectory .",
    "similarly , the propagating charged particle induces polarization in a medium . if the velocity of the particle is larger than the phase speed of the waves , a polarization shock front develops , which acts on the particle with a drag force . now the drag force , averaged over the gyrational period , has two components : along the external magnetic field and perpendicular to it .",
    "the parallel part of the drag force always slows the particle down .",
    "the surprising result is that the perpendicular component of the drag force acts to _ increase _ the transverse momentum of the particle .",
    "thus a particle undergoes a transition to the state with _ higher _ transverse momentum and _ emits _ a photon .",
    "the energy is supplied by the parallel motion .",
    "the photons emitted by such mechanism correspond to the anomalous doppler effect @xmath36 , with @xmath37 . in a vacuum , only the normal doppler resonance , with @xmath38 , is possible .",
    "the necessary condition for the anomalous doppler effect , @xmath39 , may be satisfied for fast particles propagating in a medium with the refractive index larger than unity .",
    "it is natural to attribute the emission at the normal doppler resonances to the lorentz force of the magnetic field acting on the electron , while the emission at the anomalous doppler resonances is attributed to the electromagnetic drag forces from the medium",
    ".    it may also be instructive to consider the emission process in the frame associated with the center of gyration of the particle . in that frame",
    "the waves emitted at the anomalous doppler effect have _ negative _ energy , so that in the emission process the particles increases its energy and emits a photon .",
    "the cyclotron - cherenkov instability may be considered as a maser using the induced cyclotron - cherenkov emission .",
    "the free energy for the growth of the instability comes from the nonequilibrium anisotropic distribution of fast particles .",
    "the condition that the emission rate dominates the absorption requires population inversion in the distribution function of fast particle ( maser action ) . since radiation reaction due to the anomalous doppler effect induces transition up in quantum levels , for the instability to occur we need more particles on the _ lower _ levels .",
    "from the kinetic point of view , waves grow if the quantity @xmath40 is positive for some values of @xmath26 . for an electron in a magnetic field this condition takes the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a harmonic number . here",
    "@xmath43 corresponds to normal doppler effect ( transition down in landau levels ) and @xmath44 corresponds to anomalous doppler effect ( transition up in landau levels ) .",
    "if the distribution function is a plateau - like in parallel momenta then the condition for instability is @xmath45 which could be satisfied for inverted population for the normal doppler effect or for the `` direct '' distribution for anomalous doppler effect .",
    "the latter case takes place for the beam of particles propagating along the magnetic field with no dispersion in transverse momenta .",
    "there is a possibility for the development of the cherenkov - drift instability , which occurs at the resonance @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the drift velocity , @xmath48 is the curvature radius of the magnetic field line .",
    "a weak inhomogeneity of the magnetic field results in a curvature drift motion of the particle perpendicular to the local plane of the magnetic field line . a gradient drift ( proportional to @xmath49 much smaller than the curvature drift and will be neglected .",
    "when the motion of the particle parallel to the magnetic field is ultrarelativistic , the drift motion can become weakly relativistic even in a weakly inhomogeneous field resulting in the generation of electromagnetic , vacuumlike waves .",
    "the presence of three ingredients ( strong but finite magnetic field , inhomogeneity of the field and a medium with the index of refraction larger than unity ) is essential for this type of emission .",
    "we will call this mechanism cherenkov - drift emission stressing the fact that microphysically it is virtually cherenkov - type emission process",
    ".    conventional consideration of the curvature emission ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) emphasize the analogy between curvature emission and conventional cyclotron emission .",
    "to our opinion this approach , though formally correct , has limited applicability and misses some important physical properties of the emission mechanism .",
    "it has two important shortcomings .",
    "the first is that in adopting a plane wave formalism , the interaction length for an individual electron , @xmath50 , is essentially coextensive with the region over which the waves interact with a single electron .",
    "the approach necessarily precludes strong amplification under all circumstances because the wave would have to grow substantially during a single interaction in a manner that could not be easily quantified .",
    "the second problem was a neglect of dispersion .",
    "we address the first shortcoming by expanding the electromagnetic field in cylindrical waves centered on @xmath51 , and the second explicitly by considering general plasma modes .    in a separate approach kazbegi _",
    "@xcite considered this process calculating a dielectric tensor of an inhomogeneous magnetized medium , thus treating the emission process as a collective effect .",
    "they showed that maser action is possible only if a medium supports subluminous waves . in the previous work ( @xcite we showed how these two approaches can be reconciled and argue that the dielectric tensor approach , which treats the cherenkov - drift emission as a collective process , has a wider applicability .",
    "it is more natural to consider cherenkov - drift emission in a curved magnetic field as an analog of the cherenkov emission with the drift of the resonance particles taken into account , than as the type of a curvature emission . from the microphysical point of view",
    "the emission is again due to the polarization shock front that develops due to the passage of a superluminal particle through a medium , so it is required that the emitting particle propagates with the velocity greater than the phase velocity of the emitted waves .",
    "the cherenkov - drift maser is impossible in vacuum , unlike the curvature emission , which is a close analog of the conventional cyclotron emission and is possible in vacuum .",
    "the curvature provides only the drift component of the velocity , which is essential for the coupling the resonant particle to the emitted electromagnetic wave .    in a cherenkov - type emission",
    "the resonant particle can interact only with the part of the electric field parallel to the velocity .",
    "thus , if the drift of the resonant particles perpendicular to the plane of the field line is taken into account , it becomes possible to emit a _ transverse electromagnetic _ wave with the electric field along the drift velocity , i.e. perpendicular to the plane of the curved field line ( see fig .",
    "[ cherenkov - driftemission ] ) .",
    "the growth occurs on the rising part of the parallel distribution function where @xmath52 .",
    "this is satisfied for the particles of the primary beam .",
    "rotating , strongly magnetized neutron stars induce strong electric fields that pull the charges from their surfaces . inside the closed field lines of the neutron star magnetosphere , a steady charge distribution established , compensating the induced electric field . on the open field lines , the neutron star generates a dense flow of relativistic electron - positron pairs penetrated by a highly relativistic electron or positron beam .",
    "the density of the primary beam is roughly equal to the goldreich - julian density @xmath53 .",
    "we will normalize the density of the pair plasma to the goldreich - julian density .",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 is the multiplicity factor which is the number of pairs produced by each primary particle .",
    "secondary pairs are born with almost the same energy in the avalanche - like process above in the polar cap ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pair creation front in the polar cap region is expected to be very thin so we can in the first approximation neglect the residual electric field in the front that could lead to the reversed current and different initial energies and densities of secondary particles .",
    "the combination of the pair plasma and primary beam is expected to screen the rotationally induced electric field so that the flow is force - free .",
    "another relation between the parameters of the plasma and the beam comes from the energy argument that the primary particles stop producing the pairs when the energy in the pair plasma becomes equal to the energy in the primary beam : @xmath56 where it was assumed that the initial densities , temperatures and velocities of the plasma components are equal . for cold components @xmath57 while for the relativistic components with a temperature @xmath58 the average energy is @xmath59 .",
    "the assumption of equipartition ( [ vg ] ) is very approximate one , but it allows considerable simplification of numerical estimates . if for some reason , this would turn out to be an incorrect assumption , the corresponding formula can be adjusted by changing the scaling .    as an estimate of the densities of the particles from the tail of plasma distribution we will use the assumption that the energy in the tail is approximately equal to the energy in the plasma ( and in the beam ) : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the typical energy and the density of the tail particles .      in this work",
    "we will make numerical estimates for the `` typical '' pulsar with the following parameters :    \\(i ) magnetic field is assumed to be dipole with the magnetic field strength at the surface of neutron star @xmath63 ,    \\(ii ) rotational period of the star @xmath64 s ( light cylinder radius @xmath65 cm ) .",
    "\\(iii ) average streaming energy of the plasma components @xmath66    \\(iv ) temperature of the plasma components @xmath67 .",
    "\\(v ) initial energy of the primary beam at the pair formation front @xmath68 .",
    "the energy of the beam will decrease due to the curvature radiation reaction force ( appendix [ cooling ] ) . then at the light cylinder , where the instabilities occur",
    ", the beam will decelerate due to the curvature radiation reaction to @xmath69 .    for a given period and magnetic field the equation ( [ vg ] )",
    "reduces the number of free parameters for the plasma to two : the plasma temperature and the bulk streaming energy @xmath70 ( or temperature and the multiplicity factor @xmath71 ) .",
    "we chose a strongly relativistic plasma with the invariant temperature @xmath67 .",
    "the multiplicity factor @xmath55 corresponding to these parameters follows from eq .",
    "( [ vg ] ) : @xmath72 .",
    "the average energy of the tail particles is assumed to be @xmath73 .",
    "an important factor that determines the growth rate of the instabilities is the energy scatter of the resonant particles . in estimating the growth rates of the cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift instabilities on the primary beam we will also assume that the scatter in lorentz factors of the primary particles in the pulsar frame @xmath74 . [ deltagamma ]",
    "this assumes that the beam has cooled considerably due to the curvature radiation and lost about 90% percent of its energy .",
    "several points are important in our choice of parameters .",
    "first , we use a relatively low plasma streaming @xmath29-factor ( and respectively high multiplicity factor @xmath71 ) . in the polar cap models",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) the pulsar plasma will have a low streaming @xmath29-factor if the the magnetic field near the surface differs considerably from the dipole field thus reducing the radius of curvature ( @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , the required scatter in energy of the primary beam particles ( @xmath75 ) is very small .",
    "this is due to the effects of curvature radiation reaction on the primary beam during its propagation through the dipole pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the highly nonlinear damping rate due the emission of curvature radiation by the primary beam result in an effective cooling of the beam ( see appendix [ cooling ] ) .",
    "we used two types of the particle distribution function to calculate the relevant moments : water bag and relativistic maxwellian ( @xcite ) . for the case of relativistic maxwellian distribution function",
    "the strongly relativistic temperature @xmath67 implies that , formally , there are many backward streaming particles .",
    "we note , though , that the backward streaming particles do not contribute significantly to any of the relevant moments of the distribution function , so that we can regard the strongly relativistic streaming maxwellian distribution as a fair approximation to the relatively unknown , but definitely very hot , real distribution function .",
    "the location of our typical pulsar on the @xmath76 diagram is shown on fig [ ppdot ] .",
    "the corresponding plasma densities and frequencies are given in tables [ thesesta1 ] and [ table2 ] for the two locations ( near the stellar surface and at the emission region @xmath77 cm in the pulsar and plasma reference frames .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     the radial dependence of the parameters is assumed to follow the dipole geometry of the magnetic field : @xmath78 this may not be a good approximation in the outer regions of the pulsar magnetosphere , where relativistic retardation , currents flowing in the magnetosphere and the effects of plasma loading considerably change the structure of the magnetic field .",
    "it is important for the development of both instabilities that the plasma supported subluminous waves .",
    "such wave indeed exist in a strongly magnetize electron - positron plasma .",
    "if we neglect ( as a first order approximation ) the relative streaming of the plasma electrons and positrons and the field curvature then there are three fundamental modes : transverse extraordinary wave with the electric field perpendicular to the * k - b * plane and longitudinal - transverse mode the electric field in the * k - b * with two branches : ordinary mode and alfvn mode ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . for small angles of propagation with respect to magnetic field the ordinary mode ( upper longitudinal - transverse wave )",
    "is quasi - longitudinal for small wave vector ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 - plasma frequency ) and quasi - transverse for large wave vector ( @xmath81 ) , while the alfvn mode is quasi - transverse for small wave vector and quasi - longitudinal for large ones . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates these modes in the case of cold plasma components in the plasma frame and in the low frequency limit @xmath82 ( @xmath83 is the wave frequency in the plasma frame ) .",
    "the dispersion relations for the extraordinary mode in the pulsar frame in the limit @xmath84 is @xmath85 where we used a relationship between the plasma density and the goldreich - julian density @xmath86 and the definition of the goldreich - julian density .    for the coupled alfvn and ordinary modes it is possible to obtain the asymptotic expansion of the dispersion relations in the limits of very small and very large wave vectors . here",
    "we will give the dispersion relations for the quasitransverse parts of the waves @xmath87    these relationships are valid for the frequencies satisfying the inequality @xmath88 this is a condition that in the reference frame of the plasma the frequency of the waves is much smaller that the typical cyclotron frequency of the particles @xmath89 .",
    "when the relative streaming of the plasma is taken into account , the dispersion relations change considerably : a new , slow alfvn branch appears and the extraordinary and alfvn modes behave differently in the region of small wave vectors ( @xcite ) .",
    "the polarization of the fundamental modes also changes .",
    "for the angles of propagation with respect to magnetic field less than some critical angle , which depends on the difference of the velocities of the components and on the magnetic field , the two quasi ",
    "transverse waves are circular - polarized , while for the larger angles the two transverse modes become linearly - polarized .      in this section",
    "it is shown , that the pulsar radiation may be generated by two kinds of _ electromagnetic _ plasma instabilities  cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift instabilities .",
    "the cyclotron - cherenkov instability is responsible for the generation of the core - type emission and the cherenkov - drift instability is responsible for the generation of the cone - type emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "the waves generated by these instabilities are vacuum - like electromagnetic waves : they may leave the magnetosphere directly .",
    "we assume that the distribution function , displayed in fig .",
    "[ distributionfunction ] , remains unchanged throughout the inner magnetosphere .",
    "this requires that no cherenkov - type two - stream instabilities develop and that the high energy particles are not excited to the high gyrational states by the mutual collisions or by the inverse compton effect .",
    "then the outer regions of the pulsar magnetosphere two instabilities can develop : ( i ) cyclotron - cherenkov instability and ( ii ) cherenkov - drift instability .    a detailed consideration of the conditions necessary for the development of the cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift instabilities are given in appendix [ conditioncyclotron ] and [ conditiondrift ] . both cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift instabilities",
    "develop in the outer regions of the pulsar magnetosphere at radii @xmath90 cm .",
    "the frequencies of the waves generated by the cyclotron - cherenkov instability are given by ( [ g1 ] ) @xmath91 which may be solved for the radius at which the waves with frequency @xmath13 are emitted : @xmath92 the relationship ( [ djjj1 ] ) may be regarded as a `` radius - to - frequency '' mapping . for",
    "a given @xmath93 the radial dependence of the right hand side of equation ( [ djjj ] ) will result in a radial dependence of the emitted frequency .",
    "the radial dependence of the parameters in ( [ g1 ] ) will result in emission of higher frequencies deeper in the pulsar magnetosphere , exactly what is observed .",
    "the frequencies emitted at the cherenkov - drift resonance do not have a simple dependence on radius from the neutron star .",
    "they are determined by several emission conditions which limit the development of the instabilities to the particular location in the magnetosphere and particular frequencies .",
    "the conditions that the instabilities should satisfy are : [ conditions ]    \\(i ) small growth length in a curved field lines @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the range of the emitted resonant angles [ gr ]    \\(ii ) condition of kinetic instability @xmath96    in addition to these , the cherenkov - drift instability should also satisfy another condition :    \\(iii ) the condition of a large drift @xmath97 .",
    "the condition ( i ) states that an emitting particle can stay in a resonances with the wave for many growth lengths .",
    "the condition ( ii ) is a requirement that the growth rate of instability is much smaller than the bandwidth of the growing waves .",
    "this condition is necessary for the random phase approximation to the wave - particle interaction to apply .    in appendices [ conditioncyclotron ] , [ conditiondrift ] and [ conditionmillisecond ]",
    "we show that the above conditions can be satisfied for the chosen set of parameters both in normal pulsar and millisecond pulsars .",
    "the conditions for the development of the cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift instabilities depend in a different ways on the parameters of the plasma",
    ". they may develop in the different regions of the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "in both cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift mechanism , the emission is generated by the fast particles which supply the energy for the growth of the waves .",
    "the total energy available for the conversion into radio emission is of the order of the energy of the particle flow along the open field lines of pulsar magnetosphere : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the radius of a polar cap .",
    "this is sufficient to explain the radio luminosities of the typical pulsar if the effective emitting area is about one hundredth of the total open field line cross section .",
    "the emission pattern for the `` core''-type pulsars ( according to the classification of ( @xcite ) is a circle with the angular extent of several degrees . in our model",
    "the region of the cyclotron - cherenkov instability is limited to the nearly straight field lines ( see fig . [ deutsch ] ) .",
    "the curvature of the magnetic field destroys the coherence between the waves and the resonant particles . to produce an observable emission the waves need to travel in resonance with the particle at least several instability growth lengths .",
    "far from the magnetic axis , where the curvature is substantial , the waves leave the resonance cone before they travel a growth length and no substantial amplification occurs . near the magnetic field axis",
    "the radius of curvature is very large and waves can stay in a resonance with a particles for a long time and grow to large amplitudes .",
    "by contrast , the cherenkov - drift instability requires curvature of the field lines , but its growth rate may be limited by the coherence condition . in a dipole geometry , this will limit the cherenkov - drift emission region to a ring around the central field line .",
    "another possible location of the cherenkov - drift instability is the region of the swept back field lines ( fig .",
    "[ deutsch ] )    the development of the cyclotron - cherenkov instability depends on fewer parameters than the cherenkov - drift instability .",
    "it develops on the nearly straight central field lines .",
    "the conditions for the development of the cyclotron - cherenkov instability ( eqs .",
    "[ g2 ] , [ ab ] , [ g10 ] ) depend on low powers of the plasma parameters , so it is quite robust . by contrast",
    ", the cherenkov - drift instability depends on the plasma parameters _ and _ the radius of curvature of the magnetic field in a complicated way .",
    "this results in a broader range of phenomena observed in the cone emission . if the parameters of the plasma change due the changing conditions at the pair production front , the location of the cherenkov - drift instability may change considerably",
    "this may account for the mode switching observed in the cone emission of some pulsars .",
    "it may also possible beto explain in the framework of our model the phenomenon of `` wide beam geometry '' observed in some pulsars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cherenkov - drift instability may occur in the region , where the field lines are swept back considerably .",
    "then the emission will be generated in what could be called a `` wide beam geometry '' .",
    "if the average energy of the electrons and positrons of the secondary plasma is the same , the fundamental modes of such strongly magnetized plasma are linearly polarized . both of the two quasi",
    " transverse modes ( one with electric field lying in the @xmath100 plane , another with @xmath101 perpendicular to this plan ) may be emitted by the cyclotron - cherenkov mechanism .",
    "this may naturally explain the two orthogonal modes observed in pulsars ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the difference in the dispersion relations and in the emission and absorption conditions between ordinary and extraordinary modes may explain the difference in the observed intensities of these modes .",
    "the rotation of the magnetized neutron star produces a difference in the average streaming velocities of the plasma components .",
    "this results in the circular polarization of the quasi  transverse modes for the angles of propagation with respect to the local magnetic field less than some critical angle .",
    "this may explain in a natural way the occurrence of the circular polarization in the `` core '' emission .",
    "if the cyclotron - cherenkov instability occurs on the tail of the plasma distribution function then the particles of both signs of charge can resonate with the wave . in a curved magnetic field ,",
    "electrons and positrons will drift in opposite directions ( fig .",
    "[ driftdiff ] ) .",
    "as the line of sight crosses the emission region , the observer will first see the left circularly polarized wave emitted by the electrons in the direction of their drift .",
    "when the line of sight becomes parallel to the local magnetic field the wave will resonate with both electrons and positrons in the plasma tail , so that the resulting circular polarization will be zero .",
    "finally , the observer will see the wave emitted by positrons in the direction of their drift .",
    "this can explain the switch of the circular polarization observed in some pulsars .",
    "the cone emission , which is due to the cherenkov - drift instability naturally has one linear polarization .",
    "an important difference from the standard bunching theory is that the waves emitted at the cherenkov - drift resonance are polarized perpendicular to the plane of the curved magnetic field line .",
    "this may be used as a test to distinguish between the two theories . to do so",
    ", one need to determine the absolute position of the rotation axis of a pulsar - a possible but a difficult task .",
    "one possible experiment would involve harrison - tademaru effect ( @xcite ) , which predicts that the spins of neutron stars may be aligned with their proper motion due to the quadrupole magnetic radiation if the magnetic moment is displaced from the center of the star .",
    "unfortunately , the current data does not support this theory ( in the crab , the spin of the neutron star is within @xmath102 of from the direction of the proper motion , while for vela it is approximately perpendicular ) .",
    "symmetry of plerions and direct observation of jets from pulsars ( like the one observed in vela pulsar ( @xcite ) ) combined with polarimetry of the pulsar may be useful in determining the relative position of the electric field of the wave and the magnetic axis .",
    "the cyclotron - cherenkov mechanism predicts a simple dependence of the emitted frequencies on the altitude ( eq . [ djjj1 ] ) .",
    "the predicted power - law scaling of the emission altitudes is @xmath103 .",
    "this is strikingly close to the observed scaling @xmath104 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which is derived from the simultaneous multifrequency observations of the time of arrival of pulses .",
    "a simple `` radius - to - frequency '' mapping will be `` blurred '' by the scatter in energies of the resonant particles , but the general trend that lower frequencies are emitted higher in the magnetosphere will remain .    the cherenkov - drift instability , on the other hand , does not have a simple dependence of the emission altitudes on the frequency .",
    "the resonance conditions for the cherenkov - drift instability are virtually independent of frequency ( eq . [ aa11 ] ) , so that the location of the emission region is determined by the various conditions on the development of the instability ( appendix [ conditiondrift ] ) .",
    "development of the cyclotron - cherenkov and cherenkov - drift instabilities results in an exponential growth of the electromagnetic waves .",
    "the original growth may be limited by several factors .",
    "a very likely possibility is that a spatial growth of the waves is limited by the changing parameters of the plasma .",
    "this possibility is hard to quantify since we do not know structure of the magnetic field in the outer regions of the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the original growth of the instabilities may also be limited by the nonlinear processes : quasi - linear diffusion , induced scattering and wave decay . finally ,",
    "as the waves propagate in a magnetosphere , they may be absorbed by the particles of the bulk plasma ( @xcite ) .",
    "the emergent spectra are the combined results of the these processes : emission , nonlinear saturation and absorption .",
    "we have considered the two most likely nonlinear saturation effects for the cyclotron - cherenkov instability : quasilinear diffusion and induced raman scattering ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the case of quasilinear diffusion , the induced transitions to upper landau levels due the development of the cyclotron - cherenkov instability is balanced by the radiation reaction force due to the cyclotron emission at the normal doppler resonance and the force arising in the inhomogeneous magnetic field due to the conservation of the adiabatic invariant .",
    "these forces result in a quasilinear state and a saturation of the quasilinear diffusion . we have found a state , in which the particles are constantly slowing down their parallel motion , mainly due to the component along magnetic field of the radiation reaction force of emission at the anomalous doppler resonance . at the same time they keep the pitch angle almost constant due to the balance of the force arising in the inhomogeneous magnetic field due to the conservation of the adiabatic invariant and the component perpendicular to the magnetic field of the radiation reaction force of emission at the anomalous doppler resonance .",
    "we calculated the distribution function and the wave intensities for such quasilinear state ( @xcite ) .",
    "in the process of the quasilinear diffusion , the initial beam looses a large fraction of its initial energy @xmath105 , which is enough to explain the typical luminosities of pulsars . the theory predicts a spectral index @xmath106 ( @xmath107 is the spectral flux density ) which is very close to the observed mean spectral index of @xmath108 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the predicted spectra also show a turn off at the low frequencies @xmath109 and a flattering of the spectrum at large frequencies @xmath110 ( this may be related to the upturn in pulsar spectra observed at mm - wavelength , ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "the other possible mechanism that may be important for wave propagation and as an effective saturation mechanism for instabilities of electromagnetic waves is induced raman scattering of electromagnetic waves ( @xcite ) .",
    "the frequencies , at which strong raman scattering occur in the outer parts of magnetosphere , fall into the observed radio band .",
    "the typical threshold intensities for the strong raman scattering are of the order of the observed intensities , implying that pulsar magnetosphere may be optically thick to raman scattering of electromagnetic waves .",
    "absorption processes can play an important role in the formation of the emergent spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "the waves may be strongly damped on the three possible resonances : cherenkov , cherenkov - drift and cyclotron .",
    "alfvn wave is always strongly damped on the cherenkov resonances and possibly on the cherenkov - drift resonance and can not leave magnetosphere .",
    "both ordinary and extraordinary waves may be damped on the cherenkov - drift resonance . in this case",
    "cherenkov - drift resonance affects only the ordinary and extraordinary waves with the electric field perpendicular to the plane of the curved magnetic field line .",
    "the high frequency parts of the extraordinary and ordinary wave may also be damped on the cyclotron resonances .",
    "in fact , in a dipole geometry , electromagnetic waves propagating outward are always absorbed .",
    "the fact that we do see radiation implies that waves get `` detached '' from plasma escaping absorption .",
    "it may be possible also to relate the pulsed high energy emission to the radio mechanisms .",
    "the development of the cyclotron - cherenkov instability at the anomalous doppler effect leads to the finite pitch angles of the resonant particles .",
    "the particles will undergo a cyclotron transition at the normal doppler effect decreasing the their pitch angle .",
    "the frequency of the wave emitted in such a transition will fall in the soft @xmath111-ray range with the frequencies @xmath112 in such a model the high energy emission will coincide with the core component of the radio emission , which is what is observed in crab pulsar and some other pulsars .",
    "we also note , that this may be a feasible theory for the pulsed soft @xmath111-ray emission .",
    "the hard @xmath111-ray and @xmath113-emission can not be explained by this mechanism since the total energy flux in the primary beam is not enough to account for the very high energy emission ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "* general predictions of the maser - type instability *    the formalism of the maser - type emission assumes a random phase approximation for the wave - particle interaction .",
    "any given particle can simultaneously resonate with several waves whose phases are not correlated .",
    "this is different from the reactive - type emission ( like coherent emission by bunches ) when the intensities of the waves with different frequencies are strongly correlated .",
    "thus any observation of the fine frequency structure in the pulsar radio emission may be considered as a strong argument against the reactive - type emission and in favor of the maser - type emission .",
    "* frequency dependence of the circular polarization in the core *    the cyclotron - cherenkov instability can develop both on the primary beam particles and the particles from the tail of the plasma distribution .",
    "the cyclotron - cherenkov instability on the primary beam produces a pulse which has a maximum circular polarization in its center .",
    "the cyclotron - cherenkov instability on the tail particles produces a pulse with the switching of the sense of the circular polarization in its center .",
    "since the resonance on the tail particles occurs on larger frequencies ( eq . [ g1 ] ) the effects of the switching sense of the circular polarization should be more prominent on the higher frequencies .",
    "* linear polarization of the cone radiation *    cherenkov - drift instability produces waves with the linear polarization perpendicular to the plane of the curved field line .",
    "this is in a sharp contrast to many other theories of the radio emission that tend to generate waves with the electric field in the plane of the curved field line .",
    "if one can determine the absolute position of the rotational axis , magnetic moment and the electric vector of the linear polarization , then , assuming a dipole geometry , it will be possible to determine unambiguously the position of the electric vector of the emitted wave with respect to the plane of the magnetic field line .",
    "* no cyclotron - cherenkov instability in millisecond pulsars *    in appendix [ conditionmillisecond ] we show that the cyclotron - cherenkov instability does not develop in the magnetospheres of the millisecond pulsars .",
    "since in our model the cyclotron - cherenkov instability produces core - type emission we predict that millisecond pulsars will not show core - type emission . at present , the existing observations do not allow a separation into the core and cone type emission in the millisecond pulsars .",
    "in this work we presented a model for the pulsar emission generation capable of explaining a broad range of the observations including the morphology , polarization and spectrum formation in normal and millisecond pulsars .",
    "we provided no explanation for the temporal behavior , nulling , drifting subpulses although these phenomena do not challenge the model .",
    "our model makes several testable predictions , like high altitude of the emission region and an unusual relation of the polarization direction to the magnetic axis for the cone emission .",
    "in addition it has flexibility to accommodate a variety of phenomena arising , for example , due to the temporal variations in the flow and the structure of the magnetic field in a given pulsar , or due to the different structure of the magnetosphere in different pulsars .",
    "further progress requires a better understanding of the structure of the pulsar magnetospheres both near the stellar surface where the mutipole moments of the magnetic field can substantially affect the physics of the pair formation front , and near the light cylinder , where the emission is taking place .",
    "it is also necessary to consider the nonlinear stages of the emission mechanisms described above .",

    "the conditions for the development of the cyclotron - cherenkov instability may be easily derived for the small angles of propagation with respect to the magnetic field . representing the wave s dispersion as @xmath114 and neglecting the drift term , the resonance condition ( [ a ] )",
    "may then be written as @xmath115    let us discuss the condition for the development of the cyclotron - cherenkov instability .",
    "first we note that equation ( [ g ] ) requires that @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the first is the condition that the particle is moving through plasma with the velocity faster than the phase velocity of the wave .",
    "the second condition limits the emission to the small angles with respect to magnetic field . assuming that @xmath118 and @xmath119 we find from ( [ g ] ) @xmath120 this resonant frequency increases with radius as @xmath121 .    using the upper limit on the frequencies for the relations ( [ aa10 ] ) to hold , namely @xmath122 .",
    "this sets the limit on @xmath123 : @xmath124 .",
    "this condition is satisfied for the radii : @xmath125 this is the radius where the resonance condition first becomes satisfied for the particles of the primary beam and from the tail of the distribution function .",
    "the cyclotron - cherenkov instability growth rate is ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath126 where we have normalized the density of the resonant particles to the goldreich - julian density @xmath127 .",
    "it follows from ( [ g3 ] ) that the growth rate increases with radius as @xmath128 .",
    "deeper in the magnetosphere the growth rate is slow and the waves are not excited . at some point",
    "the growth rate becomes comparable to the dynamic time @xmath129 .",
    "this occurs at @xmath130    using the equipartition condition ( [ v2 ] ) we conclude that at a given radius the growth on the tail particles is approximately the same ( the higher resonant density is compensated by the higher resonant @xmath29-factor .    starting this radius",
    "the waves will start to grow with the growth rate increasing with radius .",
    "the highest frequency of the growing mode is determined by the condition ( [ g1 ] ) evaluated at the radius ( [ g4 ] ) : @xmath131 these estimates show , that for the chosen plasma parameters the cyclotron - cherenkov instability always develops on the tail of the distribution function and can also develop on the particles from the primary beam . the higher density of the tail particles favors the development of the instability on the tail particles . the cyclotron - cherenkov instability on the tail particles occurs deeper in the magnetosphere on the higher frequencies than the cyclotron - cherenkov instability on the primary beam , which can develop further out in the magnetosphere and produce emission at the lower frequencies .",
    "the growth rate of the cyclotron - cherenkov instability should satisfy two other conditions : the growth length must be much less that the length of the coherent wave - particle interaction and the condition of the kinetic approximation .",
    "the coherent wave - particle interaction in limited by the curvature of the magnetic field .",
    "a particle can resonate with the waves propagating in a limited range of angles with respect to the magnetic field . as the wave propagates in a curved field the angle that the wave vector makes with the field changes and",
    "the wave may leave the range of resonant angles .",
    "if the range of the resonant angles is @xmath95 then the condition of a short growth length is @xmath132    for cyclotron - cherenkov instability we can estimate @xmath133 .",
    "then we find a condition on the radius of curvature @xmath134 at the distance @xmath135 .",
    "the region of the cyclotron - cherenkov instability is limited to the field lines near the central field line .",
    "the transverse size of the emission region may be estimated as @xmath136 .",
    "this gives an opening angle of the emission @xmath137 .",
    "there is another condition that the growth rate ( [ g3 ] ) should satisfy , namely the condition of the kinetic approximation . in deriving the growth rate we implicitly assumed that the wave - particle interaction is described by the random phase approximation , which requires that the spread of the resonant particles satisfies the condition @xmath138    for the particle streaming in the curved magnetic field without any gyration this condition takes the form @xmath139    for the cyclotron - cherenkov instability the last term on the left hand side of ( [ gam ] ) is the dominant : @xmath140    using the growth rate ( [ g3 ] )",
    "this condition may be rewritten as @xmath141 equation ( [ g10 ] ) means that the kinetic approximation is well satisfied inside the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "thus , the conditions for the development of the cyclotron - cherenkov instability may be satisfied for the typical pulsar parameters .",
    "the waves are generated in the observed frequency range near the central field line .",
    "the radius of emission is @xmath142 , the transverse size of the emitting region is @xmath143 and the `` thickness '' of the emitting region is @xmath144 .",
    "this may account for the core - type emission pattern .",
    "in this appendix we calculate the growth rate for the cherenkov - drift instability in the plane wave approximation . originally this growth rate has been obtained by @xcite using the single particle emissivities . here",
    "we give a derivation using the simplified dielectric tensor ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relevant components of the antihermitian part of the dielectric tensor are ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath145    the growth rate of the cherenkov drift instability can be obtained from ( @xcite ) : @xmath146 the growth rate for the lt - mode is @xmath147 and growth rate for the t - mode is @xmath148    where we chose the following polarization vectors @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( see @xcite ) for the discussion of the polarization properties of normal modes in anisotropic dielectric in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the maximum growth rate for the t - mode is reached when @xmath152 and the maximum growth rate for the lt - mode is reached when @xmath153 .",
    "we also note , that in the excitation of both lt- and t - wave it is the @xmath154 component of the electric field that is growing exponentially .    estimating ( [ qaq7 ] ) and ( [ qaq71 ] ) using @xmath123-function ( @xmath155 \\approx c \\sqrt{2   \\delta } /u_d$ ] and max[@xmath156 @xmath157 )",

    "assuming in ( [ qaq81 ] ) that @xmath164 we find the growth rates @xmath165 where @xmath166 .",
    "since cherenkov - drift resonance requires a very high parallel momentum , the resonant interaction will occur on the high phase velocity waves .",
    "this implies that , like cyclotron - cherenkov resonance , cherenkov - drift resonance is always important for the extraordinary mode , while for ordinary and alfvn modes it is important only for small angles of propagation .",
    "we can then use the small approximation to dispersion relations for the small angles of propagation ( [ aa10 ] ) . introducing cylindrical coordinates",

    "we note that for the extraordinary mode @xmath123 is independent of frequency and equation ( [ aa11 ] ) becomes independent of frequency as well .",

    "let us now discuss the condition for the development of the cherenkov - drift instability .",
    "first we drop the @xmath174 term from equation ( [ aa11 ] ) .",
    "this term is much smaller than @xmath175 for the radii satisfying @xmath176 which is satisfied everywhere inside the pulsar magnetosphere .",

    "( [ aa115 ] ) @xmath182 in what follows we assume that the cherenkov - drift resonance occurs in the outer parts of the pulsar magnetosphere where the typical value of the drift velocity is @xmath183 .    the growth rate for the cherenkov - drift resonance instability on the primary beam is calculated in appendix [ growthrate ] , eq .",
    "[ qaq82 ] . expressing the growth rate [ qaq82 ] in terms of the parameters of the magnetospheric plasma we find @xmath184",

    "we find that the condition @xmath185 is satisfied for the chosen parameters and the typical frequency of emission @xmath186 rad s@xmath187 .",
    "the next condition that a growth rate should satisfy is that the growth length be much less that the length of the coherent wave - particle interaction ( [ aa121 ] ) . estimating the range of resonant angles @xmath188 and using the growth rate ( [ qaq8201 ] )",

    "it will restrict the emission region to the field lines closer to the central field line , where the radius curvature is large .",

    "it is harder to satisfy the conditions for the development of the cyclotron - cherenkov instability in the millisecond pulsars than in the normal pulsars . since there is no clear distinction between core and cone - type emission for the millisecond pulsars it is possible that only cherenkov - drift instability develops in their magnetospheres . alternatively",
