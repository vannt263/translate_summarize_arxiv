    "among several methods in nuclear theory , the density functional method provides one of the most widely applicable treatments of many - nucleon systems .",
    "for example , the nucleus is a many - nucleon system , where more than 300 stable nuclei are already known .",
    "all atoms contain nuclei , and the chemical properties are identified by the number of protons included in the nucleus ( cf .",
    "chemical elements : h , he , li , @xmath0 ) .",
    "it follows that the nucleus is one of the most important ingredients of our universe .",
    "the theory based on the nucleonic degrees of freedom is presented , where the nucleon is not an elementary particle but consists of quarks and gluons .",
    "the validity of this theory is based on the fact that nucleons are quite stable quantum entities that can be regarded as effective physical units .",
    "since nucleons are fermions , there are several common features relating this many - fermion system with other physical systems such as many - electron systems and so on .",
    "however , there are several specific features in nuclear energy density functional .",
    "indeed , nucleons , which have isospin and spin degrees of freedom , interact by two completely different forces : nuclear and coulomb forces .",
    "in addition it is worth noting that reactions between nuclei are not similar to reactions of the other physical systems to a large extent .",
    "depending on the isospin degrees of freedom , there are two kinds of nucleons ; i.e. , protons and neutrons .",
    "while we understand the coulomb force well , much is not known about the nuclear force . indeed ,",
    "although the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) lagrangian has already been established , its connection to the nuclear force is still developing .",
    "it makes many - nucleon system research quite difficult and also fascinating .    from a scientific point of view",
    ", many - nucleon research is associated with clarifying the origin , existence , structure and reaction of chemical elements , where the origin of elements heavier than iron has not been understood well .",
    "it is an attempt to understand the time evolution of our universe with respect to the constituent chemical elements ; `` how and where were all the chemical elements created and why do they exist as they are ? '' .",
    "chemical elements which do not naturally exist on earth are called superheavy elements .",
    "these elements are artificially synthesized in the laboratory .",
    "such a superheavy element research is related with clarifying the existence limit of chemical elements .",
    "finite - body quantum systems are often investigated in the research of many - nucleon systems .",
    "although the spherical shape is expected to be energetically favoured if the system is governed simply by surface tension , the nucleus has experimentally been shown to have several shapes : e.g. , spherical , prolate , oblate shapes and so on .",
    "such a research is associated with the structure of nuclei .",
    "it is reasonable to have a unified theoretical framework describing both stationary and non - stationary states .",
    "the nuclear density functional theory is a possible candidate .",
    "the basic equation of the many - nucleon system is the schrdinger equation containing the hamiltonian .",
    "based on the independent particle motion , a possible form of the hamiltonian is generally provided by @xmath1 the first term of the right hand side arises from the kinetic energy , and the other terms in the right hand side from the interaction energy . for the interaction part ,",
    "the density functional theory in many - nucleon system is a theory describing all the interaction by several densities ( for many - electron systems , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . as is already mentioned , the interaction part of the hamiltonian is not perfectly known as far as the many - nucleon system is concerned , so that the one important task in nuclear density functional theory is to find out the ultimate interaction , which can describe all the phenomena in the many - nucleon system .",
    "this point is indeed different from studying many - electron systems .",
    "the process of finding the ultimate effective hamiltonian mainly consists of two steps ; first , to find an appropriate functional form of the effective hamiltonian ; second , to find its best parameter sets .    in this chapter much attention",
    "is paid to show a method of deriving the effective interaction in many - nucleon systems . what is presented in this chapter",
    "is a kind of modelling : the modelling of interacting femtometer - scale fermions .",

    "the effective hamiltonian arising from the nuclear force is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] ; starting from the zero - range nucleon - nucleon interaction ( sec .",
    "[ sub1 ] ) , we show a procedure of obtaining the hamiltonian density ( sec .",
    "[ sub2 ] ) ; the effective hamiltonian is obtained by applying the variational principle   ( sec.[sub3 ] ) . the effective hamiltonian arising from additional forces is briefly discussed in sec .",
    "in particular we provide a mathematically rigorous treatment of applying the variational principle , where infinite - dimensional hilbert / banach spaces are considered .",
    "for the mathematics used in this chapter , refer to the textbooks of functional analysis such as ref .",
    "there are two kinds of nucleons ( isospin degree of freedom @xmath2 ) : protons and neutrons , which are fermions .",
    "in addition the nucleon has the spin degree of freedom .",
    "therefore we are interested in the many - fermion system with spin and isospin degrees of freedom .",
    "nucleons interact by two kinds of forces : nucleon - nucleon interaction @xmath3 is represented by the sum of the nuclear potential @xmath4 , the coulomb potential @xmath5 and the pairing potential @xmath6 : @xmath7 only protons interact by the coulomb force .",

    "it is rational to determine interactions obeying invariance , because the physical law must be invariant regardless of observers .",
    "the following invariance are required for @xmath4 : translational invariance , galilean invariance , rotational invariance , isospin invariance , parity invariance , and time - reversal invariance ( for each invariance , see sec .",
    "7.1.1 of ref .",
    "it is worth noting here that the radial dependence of the function @xmath4 can not be deduced from invariance principles . among several attempts of determining the radial dependence , h. yukawa proposed the yukawa potential : @xmath16 based on meson field theory , where @xmath17 is the compton wavelength of the pion .",

    "<S> the specific features of the density functional used in studying many - nucleon systems , which is quite different from that used in many - electron systems , are also shown . the intended audience are physicists , chemists and mathematicians . </S>",
    "<S> in particular those who will start to study the density functional theory are intended . </S>"
