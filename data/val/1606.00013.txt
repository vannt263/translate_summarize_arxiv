    "galaxy evolution studies have been hampered by the lack of neutral hydrogen ( hi  ) images across cosmic time .",

    "due to technical limitations , not much is known about hi  in distant galaxies but this will soon change with the next generation of radio telescopes .",
    "hi  imaging at @xmath5 will help constrain the evolution of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and possibly explain observed phenomena at high redshift , such as the decline in the star formation rate ( sfr ) since @xmath6 @xcite .    over the past 15 years",
    ", several studies have started to uncover the hi  content beyond @xmath7 .",
    "targeted surveys have observed hi  for a limited number of galaxies at higher redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "long integration times are necessary to detect hi  emission from distant galaxies since the signal is very weak . as a consequence ,",
    "many studies use indirect methods such as stacking and intensity mapping to attain a statistical measure of how much hi  there is in the interval @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    new technology now allows telescopes to carry out hi  observations with large instantaneous frequency coverage .",
    "the first survey to do this is the blind ultra deep hi  environmental survey ( budhies ) , which detected hi  in over 150 galaxies in and around two clusters at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the recently upgraded karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) can now observe the interval @xmath10 in one setting .",
    "we did a pilot study during commissioning that covered the interval @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we reached the theoretical noise over the entire frequency range , demonstrating the feasibility of an hi  deep field .",
    "we are now conducting the cosmos hi  large extragalactic survey ( chiles ) with the vla , a 1002 hr survey where we expect to directly image the hi  distribution and kinematics of at least 300 galaxies in the cosmos field from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , with at least 200 of these at @xmath12 .",
    "these estimates are done by comparing our @xmath13 sensitivity curve ( assuming a 150 km s@xmath14  width ) to the hi  masses predicted for spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in the observed volume using the scaling relation from @xcite .    here , we report the hi  detection of the luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) cosmos j100054.83 + 023126.2 ( henceforth j100054 ) at @xmath15 with the first 178 hr of chiles data .",
    "in addition , we include co observations from the large millimeter telescope alfonso serrano ( lmt ) , and follow - up optical spectroscopic data that confirm the redshift of the detection .",
    "this study not only represents the highest redshift hi  detection in emission , but is the first time we can study the cold gas content ( both molecular and atomic hydrogen ) of a galaxy at @xmath12 .",
    "this letter adopts @xmath16 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , and a @xcite initial mass function .",

    "the cube was made with robustness parameter of 0.8 in casa , has a spatial scale of @xmath23 of 2@xmath24 pixels , and a total of 320 channels of 62.5 khz ( @xmath25 km s@xmath14 at @xmath15 ) .",
    "we first hanning smooth the data to increase the s / n and then iteratively subtract the continuum in the image plane , leading to a typical noise per channel of 75 @xmath26jy beam@xmath14 .",
    "we search for hi  by eye around a subset of the 60 predicted gas - rich galaxies .",
    "we are still in the process of searching for hi  around other galaxies directly and via stacking .",
    "we detect hi  in the galaxy j100054 , which has a predicted @xmath27",
    ". the hi  channel maps ( figure [ fig : hifig]a ) show that the emission is mostly at the @xmath28 level ( with a @xmath29 peak at the position of the galaxy ) .",
    "although the emission is weak , we trust the detection since the signal is at the location and velocity of the galaxy , and appears in several consecutive independent channels .",
    "the emission is seen in 7 panels making it 875 khz wide , which translates to a velocity width of @xmath30 km s@xmath14  after correcting for the channel width .",
    "we calculate @xmath31 assuming that the center of the emission is in panel 5 .",
    "we have high confidence in the emission seen in panels 2 - 5 since it is at the @xmath32 level , with a smooth velocity gradient , and there are no negative contours of high significance . the emission in panels",
    "6 - 8 is weaker and its velocity does not follow a clear pattern .",
    "we generate the total hi  distribution map ( figure 1b ) by adding the emission seen in the 7 channels after smoothing and applying a @xmath33 cutoff .",
    "we also make a moment map excluding the emission seen in panels 6 - 8 , and the morphology is almost identical .",
    "we calculate @xmath34 for both maps , @xmath35 for the one presented here and @xmath36 from the map only including panels 2 - 5 , showing that the hi  in panels 6 - 8 does not contribute much . as seen in figure 1b , the hi  is asymmetric and very extended , encompassing some potentially nearby companions . since the low - level emission in the southern extension is rather sensitive to the noise , the morphology is uncertain .",
    "we also include two integrated hi  spectra in figure 1c , one that integrates over the optical disk of the galaxy , and another one that is centered on the hi  emission .",
    "we calculate a s / n=7 from the hi  spectrum by adding up the signal in the range 1031.5 - 1032.5 mhz , and dividing by the rms calculated in the range 1033 - 1038 mhz ( taking into account the number of channels ) .",
    "lastly , figure 1d is a position velocity ( pv ) diagram that further shows the significance of the detection .",
    "the last panel of figure 1a shows the continuum emission from the line - free channels .",
    "in addition , we have continuum data from the commensal survey chiles continuum polarization ( chiles con pol ) .",

    "the effective beam size is @xmath42 at 84 ghz , and telescope pointing is checked on the nearby qso j0909 + 013 before each observing session .",

    "a single bright line is detected with a s / n = 9.7 centered at 83.7816 ghz ( fig .",

    "this line is fully resolved , as shown by the zoom - in spectrum shown in the inset , and the derived fwhm is @xmath46 km s@xmath14 after correcting for the instrumental resolution .",
    "the narrow co line peak ( fwhm is @xmath47 km s@xmath14 ) , centered on the optical redshift @xmath15 , sits atop a broad base , which accounts for the observed broad line width .",

    "a deep hst i - band image of j100054 ( figure 3a ) shows that it is a massive regular barred spiral with clear spiral arms and a prominent bulge .",
    "in addition , it shows a number of fainter galaxies suggesting that this may be a small group .",
    "the information for the possible companions is scarce , as the four are very faint with @xmath55 and only have measured photometric redshifts .",
    "only one of the companions has a photometric redshift similar to j100054 , but spectroscopic data are necessary to confirm this and determine whether the other ones are indeed background objects .",
    "we obtained an additional long - slit spectrum with the soar 4.1 m telescope and the goodman high throughput spectrograph on 2015 april 17 to confirm the redshift of j100054 .",
    "a slit of 1.68@xmath56 width was oriented north - south on the galaxy , and the 400 l / mm grating yielded spectral coverage 35007500   at a resolution of @xmath57 .",

    "the sfr@xmath79 is negligible , indicating that most of the star - formation is dust - obscured .",
    "we adopt sfr@xmath80 for the rest of the paper .",
    "while the optical image shows j100054 to be a large normal spiral , the cold gas properties depict a more complex picture .",
    "the hi  mass agrees with the predicted one , but its distribution and kinematics are unexpected .",
    "the hi  suggests the possibility of a gravitational interaction , as the hi  looks very disturbed .",
    "many studies have reported sfr enhancement in interacting pairs .",
    "in particular , in the case of a minor merger , the more massive companion experiences a stronger sfr enhancement than the less massive one ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "spectroscopic data are necessary to determine whether the nearby galaxies are at the same redshift .    in addition , the galaxy is extremely h@xmath51 rich , with a value that is even unexpected for local ( u)lirgs . the @xmath81 for this system is approximately 6 times higher than objects with similar @xmath63 in a sample of local ( u)lirgs ( g. privon , in prep ) . here",
    "we present a range of possible values for @xmath82 ( depending on @xmath83 ) but we note that @xmath84 is still a matter of debate even for extreme ( u)lirgs such as arp 220 @xcite .",
    "the co spectrum suggests there might be two components , a broad one and a narrow one .",
    "the fwhm of the narrow component is consistent with the hi  width within the uncertainties .",
    "the broad component could be emission from neighboring galaxies included in the large beam .",
    "we note , however , that the galaxies are fairly small and we do not expect significant contribution .",
    "the more likely explanation is an outflow such as those seen for local ( u)lirgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "lastly , we look at the sfr for different @xmath85 ( figure [ fig : comparison]d ) .",
    "j100054 is just above the starburst threshold , which is defined as four times the sfr-@xmath85 relation @xcite . in summary , these four plots show that j100054 is gas - rich both in molecular and atomic gas , but its sfr is somewhat low given its @xmath81 .",
