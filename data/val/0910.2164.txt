    "the nuclear density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite plays a central role in the quest for a microscopic and quantitative description of atomic nuclei . the energy functionals related to effective two - body density - dependent interactions are the main building blocks of the mean - field theory of the nucleus wherein the self - consistency is imposed through the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) formalism .",
    "this framework has provided a consistent description of a broad range of phenomena ranging from nuclear masses to collective excitations . over the last few years , however , with the influx of high - quality experimental data on exotic nuclei , it has become evident that the standard local functionals ( e.g. , extended skyrme functionals ) are too restrictive when one is aiming at detailed quantitative description and extrapolability @xcite . consequently , various strategies have been devised to develop realistic nuclear energy density functionals ( edf ) @xcite .",
    "these include : ( i ) the use of the density matrix expansion technique @xcite to relate the functional to low - momentum interactions ; ( ii ) extending edf by adding higher - order terms in the local densities @xcite ; and ( iii ) improving spin and isospin properties @xcite . in any case , regardless of the strategy , the fine - tuning of the coupling constants of the functional to a suitably chosen set of experimental data is necessary to provide quality description @xcite .",
    "when aiming at spectroscopic - quality functionals @xcite , the data coming from odd - mass nuclei are crucial : the energies , angular momenta , and parities of one - quasiparticle excitations provide us with basic knowledge about the underlying shell structure . moreover ,",
    "binding energies of odd-@xmath0 systems are instrumental for determining the magnitude of collective effects such as pairing .",
    "theoretically , however , since nuclei with an odd number of particles have non - zero angular momentum ( @xmath1 ) , i.e. , they are spin - polarized , their treatment is considerably more involved as compared to the @xmath2=@xmath3 ground - state ( g.s . )",
    "configurations of doubly - even nuclei .",
    "mathematically , the local edf is a time - even scalar constructed from various local densities and currents related to particle and pairing density distributions @xcite .",
    "the resulting mean field contains both time - even and time - odd terms .",
    "while the time - odd fields automatically vanish in the ground state of doubly - even nuclei , they are non - zero in @xmath1 configurations in which time - reversal symmetry is internally broken @xcite .",
    "the time - odd fields have been investigated in the context of high - spin states @xcite , gamow - teller excitations @xcite , single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "spectra @xcite , and collective dynamics @xcite .",
    "the general consensus is that they can appreciably impact the nuclear collective motion . on the other hand ,",
    "our knowledge of the coupling constants characterizing individual time - odd fields is fairly limited , and the    impact of those terms on nuclear ground - states still needs to be assessed .",
    "conversely , one can ask whether experimental data on nuclear ground states can help constrain the time - odd fields of the nuclear edf .",
    "there have been very few systematic theoretical studies of one - quasiparticle states along isotopic or isotonic chains .",

    "the only global dft study of ground state spin and parity for odd - mass nuclei is that of bonneau _ et al .",

    "the results of refs .",
    "@xcite clearly indicate that the currently used nuclear density functionals give a rather poor description of s.p .",
    "states , so it is imperative to evaluate the magnitude of the effects due to theoretical limitations and approximations .",
    "the goal of this study is to review the description of odd - mass nuclei in the framework of the nuclear dft and assess the magnitude of time - odd polarizations through large - scale surveys .",
    "we compare various treatments of blocking , associated approximations , and resulting uncertainties .",
    "we discuss the choice of the orientation of the alignment vector , which is important for maintaining s.p.characteristics during the blocking procedure .",

    "the nuclear dft in a skyrme variant has been presented in great detail in a number of articles @xcite . in the following we recall only the salient features of the theory that will be needed in this study .",
    "the cornerstone of the nuclear dft is the general one - body density operator @xmath4 .",

    "a basis of discrete states @xmath6 is introduced , where @xmath7 stands for all the s.p .  quantum numbers .",
    "the choice of one particular representation depends on the context .",
    "if @xmath8 is the many - body state , the non - local density matrix in coordinate representation reads : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a fermionic field operator creating a particle at position @xmath11 with spin projection @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the corresponding annihilation operator .",
    "the field operators can be expressed in terms of the standard fermionic creation and annihilation operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 associated with the basis @xmath6 @xcite :    @xmath16    note that in this expression , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are matrix elements of the basis transformation @xmath19 : @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "they are therefore complex s.p .",
    "wave functions dependent on the position vector @xmath11 and spin coordinate @xmath12 .",
    "the inverse relations are :    @xmath22    for complete bases , relations ( [ ctor-1]-[ctor-2 ] ) and ( [ rtoc-1]-[rtoc-2 ] ) allow us to express the relations between the two representations , @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the density matrix .",
    "the density matrix ( [ density - matrix - r ] ) can be regarded as the matrix element of an operator @xmath25 acting in the spin space .",
    "any such operator can be expressed in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath26 and the identity matrix .",
    "this leads to a spin - scalar @xmath27 and a spin - vector field @xmath28 .",

    "the contribution to the total energy of the system coming from the skyrme interaction reads : @xmath29 where @xmath30=0 and @xmath30=1 corresponds to isoscalar and isovector components , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we do not consider proton - neutron mixing @xcite .",
    "using the standard notation for the local densities and currents @xcite , the part of the energy density that depends on time - even fields can be written as : @xmath31 while the part depending on the time - odd fields is : @xmath32 all densities and currents entering eqs .",

    "@xcite .    in this work we point to another possible justification of the efa .",
    "we first notice that the time - even parts of the blocked density matrices given by eqs .",
    "( [ exactblocking - c-1 ] ) and ( [ exactblocking - c-2 ] ) are identical to the time - even parts of the density matrices in efa , eqs .",
    "( [ efa-1 ] ) and ( [ efa-2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , all time - even densities in eq .",
    "( [ heven ] ) are exactly the same in both variants .",
    "consequently , in the blocking and efa approximations , the time - even part of the functional ( sec .",
    "[ sec - dft - edf ] ) yields exactly the same self - consistent solution .",
    "this allows us to reinterpret efa density matrices as those corresponding to the time - even functional in which the time - odd polarizations exerted by the odd particle are dynamically switched off .",
    "of course , the blocking prescription and efa give exactly the same average values of all time - even observables ( e.g. , radii and multipole moments ) but differ in the average values of time - odd observables ( e.g. , spin alignments and magnetic moments ) .",
    "although for the functionals restricted to time - even fields ( or within efa ) the time - reversed q.p  states @xmath82 and @xmath83 are exactly degenerate , this is not true any more in the general case . here , the blocking prescription does depend on which of these two states , or which linear combination thereof , is used in eqs .",
    "( [ exactblocking - c-1 ] ) and ( [ exactblocking - c-2 ] ) . in order to discuss this point ,",
    "we introduce here the notion of an `` alispin '' , which pertains to the unitary mixing of states @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this is in complete analogy with the standard notion of the isospin , which involves the unitary mixing of proton and neutron states .",
    "an alivector @xmath86 is defined as a set of two complex numbers @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) : @xmath90 which corresponds to the linear combination of states @xmath84 and @xmath85 : @xmath91 .",
    "alivectors reside in su(2 ) space ; therefore the alirotation by an angle @xmath92 is defined as : @xmath93 where the alivectors of pauli matrices are denoted by @xmath94 , and @xmath95 denotes the scalar product of alivectors . to recall that the alirotation pertains to a single pair of states , we use superscripts @xmath96 throughout .",
    "the blocked density matrix eq .",
    "( [ exactblocking - c-1 ] ) corresponding to the state @xmath86 reads : @xmath97 if time - reversal symmetry is conserved , the different blocks of the bogoliubov matrices are related : @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "these relations lead to : @xmath100 or , equivalently @xmath101 therefore , in this limit , the exact blocking density matrix becomes independent of the coefficients @xmath102 of the mixing , i.e. , it is an aliscalar . since @xmath103 the efa density matrix also coincides with the exact blocking density matrix ; hence , it is an aliscalar as well .    in the general case where time - reversal symmetry is not dynamically conserved , however ,",
    "the blocking density matrix is not aliscalar and the energy of the system may change as a function of the mixing coefficients @xmath102 . to analyze",
    "what are the consequences of blocking different alirotated states @xmath104 , we introduce the ( real ) alignment vector @xmath105 and the ( complex ) decoupling vector @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "together , they form the matrix elements of the alignment vector - alivector @xmath107 : @xmath108 expanding this operator ( acting on su(2 ) alistates ) in the basis of pauli matrices , we find :    @xmath109    where indices @xmath110 enumerate the components of alivectors . from these considerations",
    "it follows that the alignment vector - alivector @xmath111 , which corresponds to the alirotated pair ( [ alirot ] ) , is obtained by : @xmath112 where @xmath113 are the standard spin-1 matrices @xcite , which are generators of rotation in the vector representation .",
    "this shows that the concept of alirotation ( equivalent to changing the mixing of the blocked state ) translates into a change in the alignment of the system .    to illustrate how this works ,",
    "let us examine the special case where the states @xmath114 and @xmath115 are eigenstates of the @xmath116 signature operator .",
    "since : @xmath117 we can express the states @xmath118 and @xmath119 in terms of @xmath120-eigenstates : @xmath121 which corresponds to the rotation of the system by the euler angles @xmath122 .",
    "consequently , the alivector @xmath123 is the vector @xmath124 alirotated by the angles @xmath125 .",
    "since ( i ) the blocked density matrix is not an aliscalar , and ( ii ) alirotations are induced by rotations of the coordinate system or , equivalently , a change of the symmetry operators used to label s.p.and q.p .",
    "states , we must conclude that the blocked density matrix may depend on the choice of the symmetry operators that commute with the hamiltonian and @xmath119 of @xmath116 , the alirotation by @xmath126 is equivalent to the @xmath116 symmetry , and therefore leaves the system invariant .",
    "this operation corresponds to @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , in this particular case , blocking state @xmath118 or state @xmath119 gives exactly the same energy , even though time - reversal symmetry is internally broken and the q.p .",
    "spectra do not exhibit the kramers degeneracy . ] .",
    "more generally , since all alignment properties of the system are embedded in the vector - alivector operator @xmath128 , we also see that the alirotation of states @xmath84 and @xmath85 corresponds to hfb states having different alignment vectors .",
    "therefore , the latter can be used to tag blocked states .",
    "this is a very convenient method , which can be applied not only for the time - even version of the functional when the quasiparticle states @xmath84 and @xmath85 are degenerate , but also in the case of internally broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the key to our considerations of blocked states is the realization that blocking must depend on the orientation of the alignment vector with respect to the principal axes of the mass distribution .",
    "therefore , the only rigorous way to proceed would be for each quasiparticle excitation to vary the orientation of the alignment vector with respect to the principal axes of the system , and retain the solution with the lowest energy @xcite .",
    "we give in sec .",
    "[ sec - results - symmetries ] a pedagogical illustration of such anisotropy of blocking .    in many practical applications , however , one chooses a fixed direction of alignment dictated by practical considerations .",
    "in particular , the identification of blocked single - particle states @xmath7 and quasiparticle states @xmath129 is most conveniently carried out through the set of conserved quantum numbers characteristic of the problem . in all calculations performed in this work , nuclei are either axially deformed or nearly axial , and they conserve reflection symmetry .",
    "the corresponding symmetry group is @xmath130 ; hence , signature @xmath131 and parity @xmath132 are good quantum numbers . in hfodd signature",
    "is defined with respect to the @xmath70-axis of the reference frame @xcite . in this way",
    ", the alignment vector is restricted to having only the @xmath70-component .",
    "to realize the three possible alignments of the angular momentum along the principal axes , it is sufficient to orient the longest , shortest , or intermediate axis along the @xmath70-axis . since in most cases ,",
    "the configurations analyzed in this study are axial , only two orientations suffice .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ sec - method - parameters ] below how to implement such a scenario .",
    "equivalently , one could work with a good @xmath133-simplex basis such as in ref .  @xcite . in that case",
    ", the default alignment is along the @xmath133-axis , but results still depend on the orientation of the body .",
    "it is only by allowing the alignment vector to cover the full solid angle that physical properties of the system would not depend on the choice of the basis used to describe the odd nucleus .",
    "this section briefly describes the dft solvers used in this work and discusses the choice of parameters entering our calculations .",
    "we also outline various optimization techniques that have been implemented by us to carry out large - scale dft calculations for one - quasiparticle states on leadership class computers .",
    "all calculations in this work are performed with the dft solvers hfbtho @xcite and hfodd @xcite . both codes",
    "solve the skyrme hfb problem in the configuration space by means of the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) expansion technique .",
    "in hfbtho , the cylindrical ho basis is used , and both axial and time - reversal symmetries are imposed .",
    "this implies that the efa must be used for blocking calculations .",
    "the 3d solver hfodd employs the cartesian ho basis and is symmetry - unrestricted .",
    "this unique feature of hfodd makes it a tool of choice for our study , since in the polarized nuclear configurations many self - consistent symmetries are usually broken .",
    "the blocking prescription is implemented exactly in hfodd with all the time - odd fields taken into account .",
    "both codes have been benchmarked against one another and they yield the same results within a few ev for spherical or axially deformed even - even nuclei @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , all nuclei considered in this work are either axial or slightly triaxial , as well as reflection - symmetric .",
    "therefore @xmath70-signature and parity are conserved and used in hfodd to tag q.p.and single - particle states .",
    "however , this implies that the total alignment is confined to the @xmath70-axis .",
    "since the latter is not the quantization axis , one can not easily associate the single - particle spin @xmath134 with the expectation value of the angular momentum : the situation is analogous to the collective rotation in high - spin physics . for the sake of identification of deformed nilsson orbitals , it is convenient , however , to reintroduce @xmath134 as a ( nearly ) good quantum number by orienting the angular momentum along the @xmath133-axis ; the resulting alignment properties correspond to the limit of non - collective rotation .    to this end",
    ", we need to associate the quantization axis with the symmetry axis of the nucleus .",
    "this can be achieved via a euler rotation of the body - fixed frame ( by @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) or by imposing constraints on the expectation values of the quadrupole tensor @xmath138 .",
    "after testing these two options , we choose the euler rotation : calculations for even - even nuclei are performed in the standard @xmath70-signature mode , then solutions are euler - rotated and used to warm - start calculations for odd - nuclei . in this way",
    ", the nilsson quantum number @xmath134 is computed from the expectation value of @xmath139 .",
    "this technique turns out to be both stable and fast .",
    "note that the energies of a given blocked state in the euler - rotated case and original orientation are different , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - dft - symmetries ] .",
    "only a complete survey of all possible orientations of the alignment vector , which would be a major computational endeavour , could pin down the correct orientation .    as is well known ,",
    "calculations for deformed nuclei converge faster if the eigenstates are expanded on a stretched basis that follows the geometry of the nuclear density .",
    "unfortunately , the stretched basis is not compatible with the euler - rotation of the nucleus in space in hfodd .",
    "for that reason , all calculations presented in this work have been carried out in a full spherical basis of @xmath140=14 oscillator shells ( the number of basis states is @xmath141= 680 ) . this choice guarantees stability of results for the relatively modest deformations considered in this study . the oscillator frequency was fixed at @xmath142 @xcite for @xmath143mev .",
    "in this work , we use three commonly used skyrme parametrizations : siii @xcite , skp @xcite , and sly4 @xcite . in the pairing channel",
    ", we employ the density - dependent delta interaction in the mixed variant @xcite : @xmath144\\delta({\\boldsymbol{r}}-{\\boldsymbol{r'}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath145@xmath146 and @xmath147 is the pairing strength ( identical for protons and neutrons ) .",
    "note that the use of such a zero - range interaction requires us to introduce a renormalization ( or regularization ) procedure to avoid non - physical divergences @xcite .",
    "we employ the standard value @xmath65=60mev .    for each skyrme edf , the pairing strength",

    "this choice has been motivated by the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite that by adjusting @xmath147 to experimental data for a spherical semi - magic nucleus one underestimates pairing correlations in deformed systems having lower single - particle level density around the fermi surface .",
    "moreover , by considering the proton pairing gap , one effectively takes into account the coulomb contribution to pairing @xcite .",
    "the pairing strengths used in this work are @xmath150mev , @xmath151 mev , and @xmath152mev for sly4 , siii , and skp , respectively . in sec.[sec - results - stability ] , we also consider sko , @xmath153mev , and skm * , @xmath154mev .",
    "the advent of teraflop and petaflop supercomputers enables large - scale surveys with symmetry - unrestricted dft solvers . to optimize resources , however ,",
    "optimization of the production codes is required .",
    "starting from the original published versions of hfodd and hfbtho , we made a number of improvements .",
    "first of all , a parallel interface using the standard message passing interface ( mpi ) has been constructed to allow the automated distribution of calculations over several computing cores .",
    "let us note that the standard nuclear dft calculations are  embarrassingly parallel \" .",
    "indeed , solving the hfb equations for one nuclear configuration usually does not exceed a few hours on a standard desktop computer .",
    "therefore , each computing core of a massively parallel system can process a single hfb task corresponding to a particular nucleonic configuration . only in the limit of very large ho bases , or for dft solvers constructed in the coordinate space , does the parallelization of the solvers become necessary .",
    "the advantage of using massively parallel architectures is that simultaneous calculations of hundreds or thousands of different many - body configurations are possible in a very reasonable time .",
    "such a strategy makes it possible to extract systematic trends , use standard statistical analysis toolboxes , and ultimately develop nuclear edfs of spectroscopic quality .",
    "the scaling of a dft problem with the number of processors also implies that a simple master - slave parallel architecture is sufficient for most applications , and this solution is adopted here .",
    "all calculations in this study were performed on the cray xt3/xt4 jaguar supercomputer at the national center for computational science at the oak ridge national laboratory and on the cray xt3 franklin supercomputer at the national energy research scientific computing center at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory .",
    "typical production runs have involved from 8,000 to 12,000 computing cores per run , and the typical calculation time was about 2 hours .",
    "the hfb equations represent a coupled system of non - linear equations for nucleonic densities .",
    "the non - linearity enters through the dependence of the mean fields on densities ( self - consistency ) . in order to diminish the number of iterations required to attain a given precision",
    ", we employ the modified broyden method @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the observation that the convergence of the hfb process stops when the characteristic variables in the problem , for example the density @xmath155 , do not change any more from one iteration to the next : @xmath156 . in other words ,",
    "the hfb equations can be viewed as a fixed - point problem , and iterations can therefore be optimized by employing a quasi - newton method .",
    "it was shown that the computational cost ( in units of number of iterations ) could be reduced substantially , by a factor of 3 to 4 .",
    "our particular implementation of the modified broyden method was described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , hfodd solves the hfb problem by expanding eigenvectors in the cartesian ho basis . in terms of speed ,",
    "one of the major bottlenecks in hfodd is the diagonalization of the hfb matrix .",
    "the latter is carried out with the subroutine zheevr of the lapack library .",
    "we found that a significant gain in terms of speed , up to 30 - 40% for large ho bases with , e.g. , @xmath140=20 shells , could be obtained by using machine - specific implementations of the blas and lapack libraries , such as atlas .",
    "based on the experience gained in self - consistent calculations for odd-@xmath0 nuclei , it appears that calculations involving blocking are always less stable than those performed for even - even nuclei .",

    "this numerical noise is the price to pay for the full self - consistency , and it explains why small differences in the initial conditions can actually affect the convergence process .",
    "when only a few nuclei are considered , and a small number of blocked configurations near the ground - state is calculated , one can often find ways to converge calculations , such as : ( i ) changing the linear - mixing parameter of the self - consistent scheme ; ( ii ) starting from the unblocked fully - paired state corresponding to an odd average particle number ( false vacuum ) @xcite ; ( iii ) starting from the even - even nucleus with one more particle for a particle - like blocked state and with one particle less for a hole - like blocked state , as implemented in ref .",

    "one may repeat it by using one or several of these tricks until a converged result is obtained .",
    "this is what was done in previous studies involving self - consistent calculations , and it was possible , because these studies were focused on ground - state properties and only a minimum number of different configurations was considered .",
