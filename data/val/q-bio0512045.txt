    "a fundamental , profound and broad - ranging unsolved question is how cooperation among animals and humans has evolved @xcite . from the point of view of natural selection ,",
    "the question to be answered is why cooperation may be a better strategy for survival or reproduction than a more selfish behavior . for this reason",
    "evolutionary game theory has been the mathematical framework that has provided the deepest insights into this issue @xcite .",
    "simple games such as the prisoner s dilemma @xcite , the snowdrift game @xcite or the stag - hunt game @xcite have been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical work along this line @xcite .",
    "one of the main achievements of this approach has been to show that the emergence of cooperation is sensitive to whether populations are well - mixed , such as in replicator dynamics evolution @xcite , or spatially structured @xcite .",
    "co - evolution of agents and networks @xcite and finite population effects @xcite are also relevant factors to take into account inasmuch as they may enhance or hinder cooperation . however",
    ", none of these approaches has considered the influence of different selection rates so far , surely because ever since darwin it has been acknowledged that natural selection acts at a very slow pace .",
    "nevertheless , recent experiments show that this may not always be the case @xcite : under certain circumstances ( e.g. strong predation or captive breeding ) evolution selects for a new trait in just a few generations .",
    "generally , research on evolutionary game theory is based on a population of individuals or agents that interact by playing a game . in the absence of spatial structure",
    ", it is posited that every agent plays the game against every other one , and then reproduction proceeds according to the payoffs earned during the game stage . for large populations , this amounts to saying that every player gains the payoff of the game averaged in the current distribution of strategies . in terms of time scales",
    ", such an evolution corresponds to a regime in which selection takes place at a much slower rate than the interaction between agents .",
    "however , these two time scales need not be different in general and , in fact , for many specific applications they can arguably be of the same order @xcite .",
    "our main aim in this work is to show that the pace at which selection acts on the population is crucial for the appearance and stability of cooperation . even in non - dilemma games such as harmony @xcite , where cooperation is the only possible rational outcome",
    ", defectors may be selected for if population renewal is very rapid .",
    "similar results hold true for several others games , thus pointing out the necessity to include a discussion on the rate of selection , compared to the rate of interaction , in any study about cooperation or any other situation modelled by evolutionary games .",
    "when selection acts at a much slower rate than interaction , a widely used tool to analyze frequency - dependent selection without mutation is replicator dynamics @xcite .",
    "replicator dynamics assumes a well - mixed population where all agents interact before selection , with a per capita growth rate of each strategy proportional to its fitness ( the payoff earned in a round of games between selection events ) .",
    "however , as stated in the previous section , we aim to understand the effects of different selection rates . to this end",
    ", we introduce the following new dynamics : there is a population with @xmath0 players . a pair of individuals is randomly selected for playing , earning each one an amount of fitness according to the rules of the payoff matrix of the game .",
    "this game act is repeated @xmath1 times , choosing a new random pair of players in each occasion .",
    "after every @xmath1 games , selection takes place .",
    "following @xcite , we have chosen moran dynamics @xcite to model selection in a finite population .",
    "one individual among the population of @xmath0 players is chosen for reproduction proportionally to its fitness , and its offspring replaces a randomly chosen individual . as the fitness of all players",
    "is set to zero before the following round of @xmath1 games , the overall result is that all players have been replaced by one descendant , but the player selected for reproduction has had a reproductive advantage of doubling its offspring at the expense of the randomly selected player .",
    "it is worth noting that the population size @xmath0 is therefore constant along the evolution .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 controls the time scales of the model , i.e. reflects the relation between the rate of selection and the rate of interaction . for @xmath2 selection",
    "is very fast and very few individuals interact between selection events .",
    "higher values of @xmath1 represent proportionally slower rates of selection .",
    "thus , when @xmath3 selection is very slow and population is effectively well - mixed .",
    "it only remains to specify the games we will be studying in this paper , namely binary games .",
    "these have been widely used in evolutionary game theory , because of their simplicity and amenability for both analytical treatment and computer simulation .",
    "a symmetrical binary game is completely defined by its @xmath4 payoff matrix ( or normal form , see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath5 whose rows give the payoff obtained by each strategy when confronted to all others including itself . when interpreted as a model for the emergence of cooperation ,",
    "c and d denote , respectively , the strategies `` cooperate '' and `` defect '' .",
    "different kinds of games have been defined according to the relations between the four coefficients of the matrix @xcite .",
    "the dynamics we introduced in the previous section can be studied analytically and exactly in the following manner : let us denote by @xmath6 the number of cooperators present in the population .",
    "we calculate the probability @xmath7 of ending up in state @xmath8 ( i.e. , all players cooperate ) when starting in state @xmath9 . for @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    ", we obtain an exact , analytical expression for @xmath7 . for arbitrary values of @xmath1",
    ", such a closed form can not be found ; however , it is possible to carry out a combinatorial analysis of the possible combinations of rounds and evaluate , numerically but exactly , @xmath7 .",
    "see appendix [ maths ] for the detailed mathematics .    as our first and most striking example of the influence of the selection rate",
    ", we will start by considering the harmony game @xcite , determined by @xmath12 .",
    "the _ only _ nash equilibrium of this game is @xmath13 , as it is obvious from the payoffs : the best option for both players is to cooperate , which yields the maximum payoff for each one . when this game is framed in our dynamical model , fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a shows that the rationally expected outcome , namely that the final population consists entirely of cooperators , is not achieved for small and moderate values of the selection rate parameter @xmath1 . for the smallest values , only when starting from a population largely formed by cooperators there is some chance of reaching full cooperation ; most of the times , defectors will eventually prevail and invade the whole population .",
    "this counterintuitive result may arise even for values of @xmath1 comparable to the population size , by choosing suitable payoffs ( not shown ) .",
    "interestingly , the main result that defection is selected for small values of @xmath1 does not depend on the population size @xmath0 ; only details such as the shape of the curves ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig:1]b ) are modified by @xmath0 .",
    "[ figure [ fig:1 ] here ]    in the preceding paragraph we have chosen the harmony game to discuss the effect of the rate of selection , but this effect is very general and appears in many other games . to see this , consider the example of the stag - hunt game @xcite , with payoffs @xmath14 .",
    "this is the paradigmatic situation of a @xmath15 game with two nash equilibria in pure strategies , one pareto - dominant @xcite @xmath13 , in which players maximize their payoffs , and the other risk - dominant @xcite @xmath16 , in which players minimize the possible damage resulting from a defection of the partner . which of these equilibria is selected has been the subject of a long argument in the past , and rationales for both of them can be provided . as fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows , results for small @xmath1 are completely different from those obtained for larger values .",
    "indeed , we see that for @xmath10 , all agents become defectors except for initial densities of cooperators close to 1 . however , for values of @xmath17 the resulting curve is quasi - symmetrical , reflecting a much more balanced competition between both strategies .",
    "[ figure [ fig:2 ] here ]    yet another example of the importance of the selection rate is provided by the snowdrift game @xcite , defined by the payoffs @xmath18 .",
    "also known as chicken or hawk - dove , it is a dilemma game not unrelated to , but different from , the prisoner s dilemma .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows that for small values of @xmath1 defectors are selected for almost any initial fraction of cooperators .",
    "when @xmath1 increases , we observe an intermediate regime where both full cooperation and full defection have a nonzero probability , which , interestingly , is almost independent of the initial population . and , for large enough @xmath1 , full cooperation is almost always achieved .",
    "[ figure [ fig:3 ] here ]    finally , we show for completeness the results for the most ubiquitous game in studies about the evolution of cooperation : the prisoner s dilemma @xcite , with payoffs @xmath19 .",
    "as is well known , in this game the rational choice is to defect .",
    "the effect of a small number of games , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , is to bias the game even more towards defection . in any case",
    ", the initial density of cooperators must be very large for cooperation to have some chance of becoming the selected strategy , but for small values of @xmath1 this requirement is most severe .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath1 does not change the qualitative behavior of the prisoner s dilemma , alhtough once again low @xmath1 works against cooperation .",
    "[ figure [ fig:4 ] here ]    similar results are to be found in almost any binary game .",
    "indeed , it can be shown that d strategists are selected for when the payoffs satisfy @xmath20 in the extreme case @xmath10 , irrespective of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , or the population size @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "( [ 3b ] ) in appendix [ maths ] ) .",
    "larger @xmath1 values can not be analyzed in such a simple manner and , in particular , the corresponding results depend on all four parameters of the payoff matrix .",
    "the reason for this dramatic influence of the parameter @xmath1 resides in the resulting fitness distribution over the population . for large values of @xmath1 @xmath23",
    ", most agents have played between selection events , and as a consequence most of the population has nonzero payoff , which in turn implies a nonzero probability of being selected for reproductive advantage . on the contrary , with small @xmath1 @xmath24",
    "the distribution concentrates on the few players that have actually played , these ones being the only candidates for selection .",
    "this results in a completely different probabilistic scenario , with the consequences reflected in the results above .    as a specific example , consider the stag - hunt game shown in fig.[fig:2 ] , for the particular initial number of cooperators @xmath25 . with values of @xmath26 ,",
    "the payoffs are distributed to a large set of pairs of players , with approximate frequencies of @xmath27 @xmath13 , @xmath27 @xmath16 and @xmath28 @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "given that the payoff matrix fulfills @xmath31 , both strategies collect a practically equal amount of fitness , thus with no reproductive advantage for any strategy and then @xmath32 .",
    "however , considering the case of @xmath33 , only a few pairs are selected to play . with pairs @xmath34 or @xmath16 ,",
    "the reproductive advantage is obviously the same , as only one strategy receives all the fitness . but pairs @xmath35 or @xmath30 will draw a strong advantage to defectors , given the relation @xmath36 , which in the end causes @xmath37 .",
    "results for other games can be understood in a similar way .",
    "let us now summarize our main findings . we have shown that selection rate plays a crucial role in determining the fate of cooperation , by studying how evolutionary dynamics in a moran setting depends on the number of times the game is played between selection events .",
    "we have seen that even in a game as simple as harmony , where cooperating is the only rational outcome , rapid selection leads to the success of defectors .",
    "we have observed similar behavior in other examples such as the snowdrift and the stag - hunt games . in binary games about cooperation situations ( including prisoner s dilemma ) , we have found that rapid selection rates generally lead to the promotion of defectors . in other contexts",
    "the interpretation of the results would be different ( such as a choice of the risk - dominant coordination option in the stag - hunt game ) but the effect of the selection rate will undoubtedly be there .",
    "it is important to stress that the results are fully analytic , involve no approximation , and apply to both finite and infinite populations .",
    "although in this paper we have worked only in the framework of binary games , we believe that our main claim , namely that different time scales for interaction and selection can modify the outcome of evolution , is relevant to evolutionary games in general .",
    "consider , for instance , the ultimatum game @xcite , which is one of the most frequently used games in theoretical and experimental studies of cooperation .",
    "this game is much more complex than the previous binary games , as it asymmetrical , i.e. each individual of the pair of interacting players has a role , and there is a large number of strategies , not just two . in the ultimatum game , under conditions of anonymity ,",
    "two players are shown a sum of money .",
    "one of the players , the `` proposer '' , is asked to offer an amount of this sum to the other , the `` responder '' .",
    "the proposer can make only one offer , which the responder can accept or reject .",
    "if the offer is accepted , the money is shared accordingly ( the proposer receives the rest of the money ) ; if rejected , both players gain nothing .",
    "since the game is played only once ( no repeated interactions ) and anonymously ( no reputation gain ) , a self - interested responder will accept any amount of money offered whereas a self - interested proposer will offer the minimum possible amount which will be accepted .",
    "this is precisely the outcome predicted by the replicator dynamics in a well - mixed population : the final population will consist only of fully rational agents which offer the smallest possible amount and accept any amount @xcite . on the contrary , relaxing the assumption of a well - mixed population in favor of a dynamics that allows a faster selection rate changes this result absolutely . proceeding similarly to the binary games of the previous section , pairs of players",
    "are randomly selected to interact , in series of @xmath1 rounds between reproduction - selection events .",
    "exhaustive simulations of different versions of the game with this kind of dynamics have shown that fair split becomes then the dominant strategy @xcite .",
    "an analytical study of this problem that confirms the simulation results is under way @xcite .    finally , the most important implication of our results is that , in studies about the emergence of cooperation , the rate of selection is an extremely influential parameter and very often leads to non - trivial , unexpected outcomes .",
    "of course , the scope of this result is not limited to cooperation among humans , as cooperative phenomena have been reported for many other species including bacteria @xcite .",
    "in fact , the research reported here stresses the importance of selection rates for evolutionary game theory , for all the situations it models ( not only cooperation ) and for evolutionary theory in general @xcite .",
    "in moran dynamics , at each time step an individual is chosen for reproduction proportional to its fitness , and one identical offspring is produced that replaces another randomly chosen individual . in a population of @xmath0 individuals where @xmath38 are c strategists ( cooperators ) and @xmath39 are d strategists ( defectors ) , we have a markov process with a tridiagonal transition matrix ( a birth - death process @xcite ) given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the fitness earned by cooperators ( @xmath43 ) or defectors ( @xmath44 ) after @xmath1 games , and @xmath45 denotes the average over realizations of the process .",
    "the dependence of the calculation on the selection rate , i.e. , on @xmath1 , enters only in these two quantities .",
    "the solution to this birth - death process is obtained in a standard manner @xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath7 the probability of ending up in state @xmath8 when starting off from state @xmath38 .",
    "then we have @xmath46 with boundary conditions @xmath47 , @xmath48 . the solution to this equation",
    "is given by @xmath49 when the ratio of the transition probabilities can be written as @xmath50 equation ( [ 6 ] ) has the closed form @xmath51,\\ ] ] where the generalized binomial coefficient is defined as @xmath52 .",
    "for the extreme case @xmath10 there are two possible outcomes of the variable @xmath53 , namely @xmath54 , with probability @xmath55 ( that of pairing two cs ) , and @xmath56 , with probability @xmath57 ( that of pairing a c and a d ) .",
    "thus , we have @xmath58.\\ ] ] using a similar reasoning for @xmath59 we end up with @xmath60 which has the form ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "notice that if @xmath20 then @xmath61 regardless the values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    in the opposite limit @xmath11 every player plays with every other an infinite number of times , so @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the payoff of @xmath64 strategists when every player plays with every other once .",
    "thus , in this case @xmath65 which has the form ( [ 7 ] ) only when @xmath66 .    for other values of @xmath1 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 can be computed through a combinatorial enumeration of all possible pairings , and the resulting exact expression ( too cumbersome to be included here ) can then be evaluated numerically .",
