    "radio - frequency modulation allows the frequency precision of a stabilised laser to be coherently translated to adjacent wavelengths , and pairs of optical frequencies to be generated with low differential frequency noise .",
    "when achieved by electro - optic modulation , or direct modulation of the current through a diode laser , however , the different frequencies continue to propagate in the same beam mode",
    ". spatial separation hence requires a frequency - dependent transmission or deflection .",
    "a commonly - used device for this is the mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) : with an appropriate path difference within the device , the sidebands emerge from one output port and the carrier from the other . for certain wavelengths ,",
    "a similar effect can be achieved by employing the frequency - dependent faraday effect in an atomic vapour @xcite .",
    "mach - zehnder interferometers find applications as filters and frequency - dependent beam - splitters and combiners @xcite for a variety of applications in optics @xcite , metrology @xcite and quantum information @xcite .",
    "fiber - optic interferometers offer several advantages over free - space devices , such as improved output beam quality , easier integrability with other fiber - optic systems , lower sensitivity to vibrations and air currents , and a generally higher extinction ratio thanks to the ease and accuracy with which the beams may be recombined .",
    "previous applications have included passively - stable microscopic devices for refractive index measurement @xcite , interferometers that intentionally remain unstabilised for sensing purposes @xcite , and devices that have been actively stabilised by dithering @xcite or locking to the side of an interference fringe @xcite .",
    "polarization - dependent methods such as hnsch  couillaud locking , which we have previously used to stabilise a free space interferometer @xcite , can not easily be applied to fiber - optic devices because of the high temperature - dependence of the birefringence upon which polarization - maintaining fibers depend . here , we demonstrate a similarly robust alternative stabilisation method that is suitable for fiber - based interferometers , using a convenient variation of frequency - modulation stabilisation @xcite .",
    "the stabilisation of an interferometer to maximize or minimize the transmission at a given wavelength presents the difficulty that a deviation to either side of the optimum configuration has the same effect upon the transmitted intensity ; this parameter itself therefore gives no indication of the sign of the correction required .",
    "one solution is to perturb the interferometer in a slow , periodic ` dither ' and monitor the relative phase of variation of the transmitted intensity .",
    "a popular alternative is to accept a small offset and stabilise the transmitted intensity to a value just below its peak or above its minimum . in both cases ,",
    "being near a turning point in the measured parameter , the interferometer must be significantly perturbed or displaced for a measurable signal to be obtained .",
    "a more elegant technique , commonly used for the spectroscopic stabilisation of lasers and optical resonators , is to generate sidebands at frequencies either side of the wavelength required and measure the differential effect upon these components .",
    "in contrast to the large , slow perturbations of a dither , these components may be generated by the weak but rapid variations of frequency or phase modulation .",
    "the system remains in its stabilised configuration , and most of the optical power remains at the desired wavelength .",
    "phase - sensitive detection of the beat note in the transmitted intensity then yields the error signal directly @xcite .    here , partly for practical expedience and to avoid parasitic amplitude modulation",
    ", we use a variation upon conventional frequency modulation stabilisation and generate the sidebands by acousto - optic modulation of a fraction of the incident light , which we then direct backwards through the interferometer via the spare output port of the instrument . where true frequency modulation uses beating of the sidebands with the carrier to provide a periodic alternation between the two sidebands",
    ", we achieve this directly by using a suitably aligned chopper wheel : although somewhat inelegant , this approach allows a large sideband spacing while requiring only low frequency detection circuitry .",
    "the derived error signal is used to control the temperature , and hence refractive index , of one arm of the interferometer via a thermoelectric cooler ( tec ) upon which one of the fibers is mounted ; it would alternatively be possible to stretch the fiber using a piezoelectric actuator , as in @xcite .",
    "our apparatus is shown schematically in figure [ mzisetup ] .",
    "the mach - zehnder interferometer is a custom device , supplied by ozoptics @xcite , with internal fiber arms 0.3  m long , one of which is attached to a thermoelectric cooler to regulate its temperature .",
    "an incident laser beam with frequency @xmath0 , bearing sidebands at @xmath1  2.7 ghz , is directed into port a of the mach - zehnder interferometer ; the sidebands are intended to emerge from port d , while the rejected carrier should be sent to port c. a fraction of the incident beam is split off from the main path and sent to the acousto - optic modulator , which produces two spatially distinct beams with frequencies @xmath2 , where @xmath3 80  mhz .",
    "these are alternately fed backwards through the interferometer to the photodiode pd1 . using an indication of the chopper wheel phase provided by pd3",
    ", a microcontroller determines the error signal , which is proportional to the difference in transmitted intensity between the two aom beams , and adjusts the current supplied to the thermoelectric cooler accordingly .",
    "the error signal is given theoretically as follows .",
    "if the fiber lengths within the instrument are @xmath4 , and the fibers have a frequency - dependent refractive index @xmath5 ( including waveguide dispersion ) , then the accrued phase difference @xmath6 between the two paths will be    @xmath7    and the difference in phase difference @xmath8 between optical frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath9 will hence be    @xmath10,\\ ] ]    which may be expanded , assuming constant dispersion , to give    @xmath11   = \\frac{\\delta l \\omega_m}{c } \\left[\\eta(\\omega_0 ) + \\omega_0 \\frac{d\\eta}{d\\omega}\\right ]   = \\frac{\\pi \\omega_m}{\\omega_s } ,   \\label{disp}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is the difference between frequencies that will be separated by the interferometer and is given by    @xmath13}.   \\label{omegas}\\ ] ]    the fraction of light transmitted between diagonally opposite ports of the interferometer will then be proportional to @xmath14 , and the error signal will hence be proportional to    @xmath15    where @xmath16 as defined in equation ( [ disp ] ) above.the form of the error signal @xmath17 is hence given by    @xmath18    this is equal to zero and has finite gradient at both @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is therefore suitable for stabilising the interferometer to maximize transmission of the carrier to either output port according to the sign of the feedback @xcite .",
    "a plot of this signal as a function of the frequency of the input beam is shown in figure [ theoplot ] .",
    "the separation of two closely spaced frequency components of a phase - modulated laser beam is a function that is often required in atomic physics experiments @xcite and laser stabilisation schemes @xcite . for our atomic physics experiments , for example , in which we stimulate raman transitions between the ground hyperfine states of @xmath21rb ,",
    "we modulate a 780  nm laser beam by passage through a 2.7  ghz electro - optic phase modulator ( the remaining 300  mhz being provided by subsequent acousto - optic modulation ) , giving the spectrum shown in figure [ sidebandplot](a ) , in which @xmath2215% of the power is split between the two first - order sidebands . for use in our experiments",
    "the central carrier must be largely eliminated .",
    "many previous solutions incur a significant power loss @xcite or offer only a limited extinction ratio @xcite .",
    "the mach - zehnder interferometer allows the efficient separation of components that differ in frequency by an odd multiple of @xmath12 , defined in equation ( [ omegas ] ) . with an optical path difference @xmath23 specified for our device as 56.0@xmath10.5  mm , @xmath12 = 2.7  ghz , and we may reject the carrier and send only the sidebands to the chosen output port of our interferometer , resulting in the spectrum shown in figure [ sidebandplot](b ) , in which the carrier has been suppressed by over 30 db through interferometric means .",
    "in addition to this , the carrier and sidebands are both attenuated by @xmath224  db by passage through the interferometer , owing to the poor beam quality of the incident light which limited the coupling efficiency into the interferometer .",
    "although a path difference tolerance was specified for the practical device , no measurable difference was found between the positions of minimum carrier transmission and maximum transmission of the first - order sidebands .",
    "mhz relative to the carrier .",
    "interferometric suppression of the carrier is in excess of 30  db . ]      the system in figure [ mzisetup ] was constructed and the signals from each photodiode were sent to a simple digital control system based around an arduino microcontroller @xcite .",
    "the interferometer itself was constructed to our specifications by ozoptics @xcite , with the inter - arm path difference set such that @xmath24 2.7  ghz .",
    "although our specifications allowed small inequalities in power division at the beamsplitters , we in practice observe no measurable effects . with the input at port a and a constant total laser power",
    ", the signal from photodiode pd2 can be used to derive the proportion @xmath25 of the optical power emerging from the interferometer s outputs that leaves via port d. equal powers must be coupled into the interferometer from each of the frequency - shifted beams entering port c ; failure to do so results in narrowing of the locking region and a slight alteration of the lock point .",
    "figure [ errvstransplot ] shows the variation of the power transmission @xmath25 and the error signal @xmath26 during a rapid scan of the inter - arm path difference in the interferometer , performed by making a sudden change to the current supplied to the tec .",
    "the error signal not only exhibits a zero value corresponding with each minimum of @xmath25 , but also the desired antisymmetric form about these points .     from port a to port d , and error signal @xmath26 , shown as functions of time during a rapid scan of the interferometer over several fringes .",
    "the noise on the error signal is primarily electrical in origin . ]",
    "the power transmission @xmath25 was recorded for a period in excess of 2 hours , during which the interferometer was actively locked to a minimum of @xmath25 ( corresponding to @xmath27 ) .",
    "fast fourier transforms of @xmath28 , over both this period and another period of equal length during which the interferometer was left unstabilised , are shown in figure [ fft ] .",
    "the time - average of @xmath25 during this period was @xmath29 ( corresponding to an interferometric extinction of 32.0  db ) .",
    "we believe this to have been limited by the response rate of our feedback system , as measurably non - zero values of @xmath25 were generally accompanied by a notable deviation of the error signal from zero .",
    "extinction could therefore be improved by increasing the response rate of the feedback system , for example by replacing the tec with a fiber - stretching piezoelectric transducer , as in @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated a stable locking method for a fiber - optic mach - zehnder interferometer with a macroscopic inter - arm path difference . our device allowed the time - averaged output from a chosen port",
    "to be interferometrically suppressed by 32  db for a period of over two hours .",
    "the extinction is believed to be limited by the response rate of our feedback system , which might be improved by switching from thermal to mechanical feedback .",
    "our interferometer has been used to separate the carrier wave from the first - order sidebands of a 780  nm laser beam after electro - optic modulation at 2.7  ghz .",
