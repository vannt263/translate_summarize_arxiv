    "the presence of particles in a flowing suspension causes macroscopically relevant effects via small disturbances of the local velocity of the suspending medium even for laminar homogeneous flows .",
    "this effect can augment the transport through the suspension  @xcite .",
    "an important example is blood which is a suspension mostly consisting of red blood cells ( rbcs ) in blood plasma .",
    "of special interest for medical applications is the transport of plasma molecules which due to their dimensions can be assumed to follow the streamlines of the flow and which play a crucial role in blood clotting phenomena .",
    "while advances in the development of coarse - grained blood models have been made , simulations of realistic vessel geometries at particulate resolution are still computationally expensive  @xcite .",
    "therefore , continuous descriptions of blood are applied frequently to study flows at large scales , compared to single cells , eventually supported by a continuous description of the effective transport of cellular and molecular blood constituents  @xcite .",
    "the present work aims instead at developing a continuous description of the fluid velocity fluctuations and its comparison with large - scale particulate simulations in an infinite channel with a single constriction .",
    "a similar geometry is modeled , for example , in ref .",
    "defining appropriate boundary conditions for the inlet and outlet is not trivial in the case of suspensions .",
    "section  [ ch : method ] briefly introduces the coarse - grained particulate blood model  @xcite employed here .",
    "section  [ ch : pi ] contains a description of the required boundary conditions in a parallel implementation .",
    "section  [ ch : rec ] deals with the reconstruction of the flow field and of the plasma velocity fluctuations in a non - particulate simulation .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ ch : conclusions ] .",
    "in an earlier work , a simplified particulate blood model was developed  @xcite .",
    "rbcs are described as oblate spheroids coupled to a lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method  @xcite that accounts for the blood plasma .",
    "one lattice spacing resembles @xmath0 , one lb time step @xmath1 .",

    "@xmath3 stands for the lb equilibrium distribution function for density @xmath4 and velocity @xmath5 of the fluid and @xmath6 for the respective lattice vector .",
    "the present simulations are the first application of this model to a situation where  due to the drop of the pressure @xmath7 induced by the stenosis ",
    "the fluid density @xmath8 varies macroscopically across a system with many cells . under these conditions , the global average @xmath4 in eq .",

    "@xmath12 is an average over all fluid sites at the surface of cell @xmath13 .",

    "( [ eq : deltapppp ] ) at direct cell - wall links .",
    "sometimes a slight mass drift is observed whereas a constant density @xmath4 makes significant spatial variations of @xmath15 impossible in the presence of many cells .",
    "therefore , all densities are rescaled periodically to keep the global average density constant . in the simulations below , the required rescaling factor differs by less than @xmath16 from unity if rescaling is performed every @xmath17 time steps .    since eq .",

    "@xmath19 is @xmath11 s local velocity half - way along the link .",
    "the resulting forces on two cells remain opposite but equal up to first order in velocity .",
    "similarly , for cell - wall links , a fluid distribution @xmath20 is assumed at the wall site . at a cell volume fraction of @xmath21 , the new contact rule leads to an enhancement of the relative suspension viscosity @xmath22 by @xmath23 to @xmath24 or about @xmath25 to @xmath26 for shear rates @xmath27 .",
    "accurate sub - lattice corrections for the hydrodynamic interactions of rigid spheroidal particles near contact have been presented recently  @xcite .",
    "the transition length that a suspension needs to flow through a channel until a macroscopically stable state is achieved is known to be particularly large because of the time required for the particles to re - distribute in response to the laterally inhomogeneous flow  @xcite .",
    "since an appropriately long simulation volume is computationally too expensive , one could close the geometry in the flow direction with periodic boundary conditions and simulate for times long enough that each cell and each volume of fluid passes the system several times .",
    "there is the concrete risk , however , that because of the same effect  @xcite the suspension would retain a memory of the stenosis and the simulation would describe not the flow through a stenosed channel but , in fact , the flow through an infinite series of stenoses .",
    "appropriate boundary conditions are required that provide the cell configurations expected for a long channel without stenosis . the configuration expected for a long channel , however",
    ", is not known _ a priori_. a solution is to develop boundary conditions that allow to independently simulate a periodic sub - volume resembling an infinitely long channel while the resulting configurations are fed into the inlet of the volume that contains the stenosis .",

    "[ fig : periodic - inflow-4 ] . copies of model cells in the periodic sub - volume are generated as soon as they approach the periodic boundary .",
    "while the copied cells are entering the non - periodic volume , their motion is still prescribed by the motion of the original cells .",
    "once the cells in the non - periodic sub - volume have reached a longitudinal position about one cell diameter away from the entrance layer , the connection to the original cells is dismissed and the copied cells interact with the fluid and the surrounding cells as free particles . before a cell in the non - periodic sub - volume reaches the last lattice layer , the sites occupied by it are replaced with fluid initialized according to the local rigid body motion of the cell and the average fluid density @xmath14 . on - site",
    "boundary conditions  @xcite impose the density @xmath15 and the mass flow @xmath28 obtained for every site of the first lattice layer of the periodic sub - volume on the first and the last layer of the non - periodic sub - volume , respectively .",
    "if , in the case of the mass flow , the source position is occupied by a model cell , an estimate is made based on its rigid body motion and the average fluid density .    in a parallel implementation , additional communication in the longitudinal direction",
