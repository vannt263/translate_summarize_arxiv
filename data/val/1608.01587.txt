    "these instruments will extend the measured spectra of known gamma ray emitters , and have the potential to discover new classes of sources . besides the studies of pointlike and quasi  point  like sources , future detectors with a large field of view ( as lhaaso and hiscore ) will have the potential to measure diffuse gamma ray fluxes , such as those produced by the interactions of galactic cosmic rays in interstellar space , or generated by an ensemble of unresolved weak sources , or perhaps , more speculatively , by the decay of dark matter particles in our galaxy .",
    "of particular interest is the search for gamma ray counterparts to the astrophysical neutrino signal recently observed by icecube in the range @xmath102000  tev @xcite .",
    "gamma rays in the energy range we are discussing ( @xmath0  tev ) suffer non ",

    "additional absorption can also occur in the source itself and/or in the circum  source environment .",

    "the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , generated by the emission of all radiation sources in the universe , also fills uniformly space with an average density of approximately 1.5  @xmath11 of higher energy photons .",
    "absorption by the cmbr and ebl essentially precludes extragalactic gamma astronomy above 30  tev , on the other hand galactic astronomy remains possible , but the interpretation of the observations requires taking into account the effects of photon absorption .",
    "the main source of target photons for the propagation of gamma rays in the galaxy ( together with the accurately known cmbr ) is the infrared emission of dust , heated by stellar light .",
    "the radiation field generated by the dust emission has nontrivial energy , space and angular distributions that must be carefully modeled to compute the absorption effects .",

    "the publicly available version of the galprop code has been recently used by esmaili and serpico ( hereafter es ) @xcite to obtain the radiation density in different points of the galaxy , and the results have been used to evaluate the absorption of high energy galactic gamma rays ( with the approximation of an isotropic angular distribution of the target photons ) .",

    "@xcite calculated at redshift @xmath85 .",
    "the ebl angle integrated number density is small , of order 1.5  @xmath11 .",
    "this has the consequence that this component , while very important for extragalactic gamma rays , has a negligible effect for the propagation of photons inside our galaxy .            the absorption coefficient in the solar neighborhood ( averaged over direction ) is shown in fig .  [ fig : kabs - sun ] .",
    "it is instructive to briefly discuss the results .",
    "the contribution of the cmbr has a maximum for a gamma ray energy @xmath89  pev , where the absorption coefficient has the value @xmath90",
    "these numerical results are easy to understand qualitatively .",
    "the energy of maximum absorption @xmath92 is approximately equal ( it is larger by a factor 1.34 ) to @xmath93 where @xmath94 the average energy of the cmbr photons , and corresponds to the gamma ray energy that is best matched to the distribution of the target photons to maximize the pair production cross section .",
    "the maximum value of the absorption coefficient @xmath95 is approximately equal to ( a factor 0.76 of difference to ) to the quantity @xmath96 , which is the product of the pair production at maximum ( @xmath97 ) and the total number density of cmbr photons .",
    "for @xmath98 the absorption coefficient falls very rapidly reflecting the spectral shape of the cmbr photon distribution , while for @xmath99 the absorption coefficient falls @xmath41 reflecting the @xmath100 dependence of the pair production cross section at large @xmath101 .",
    "this pattern for the energy dependence of the absorption coefficient is repeated for the components associated to the target radiation generated by dust and star emission . in these three cases ( cmbr ,",
    "dust emission and star emission ) the energy spectrum of the radiations has ( exactly in the case of the cmbr , and approximately in the other two cases ) a blackbody shape , characterized by temperatures of approximately 2.7  kelvin for the cmbr , 20  kelvin for the dust emission and 30007500  kelvin for starlight .",
    "accordingly , the average energies of the photons associated to the three components are significantly different : ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 and 0.97  ev for cmbr , dust and star emission , respectively ) .",
    "this implies that the critical energy @xmath104 where the absorption effects are largest is 2.2  pev for the cmbr , 150  tev for the dust emission and 1.6  tev for the star emission .",
    "the three components contribute approximately the same energy density to the target radiation field in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath105 , 0.25 and 0.42  ev/@xmath79 ) , ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_here ] ) however since the average photon energies are different , the ( energy and angle integrated ) number densities for the three components are also significantly different ( @xmath106 , 25.0 and 0.43  @xmath11 ) .",
    "the maximum absorption coefficient is proportional to the total number density and is therefore very different for the three components ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109  kpc@xmath91 ) .    for an estimate of the importance of the angular distribution of the target radiation",
    "one can inspect fig .",
    "[ fig : kabs - angular1 ] that shows the absorption coefficient calculated at the position of the sun for the lines of sight that point towards the center and anticenter of the galaxy .",
    "the figure also shows for comparison the absorption coefficient calculated assuming an isotropic angular distribution for the photons .",
    "for the line of sight towards the galactic center ( anticenter ) most of the target photons are parallel ( antiparallel ) to the gamma ray direction , and this gives a lower ( higher ) absorption , with deviations of order @xmath110% with respect to the result for an isotropic distribution .",
    "m by the iras satellite , and for photons traveling radially from and towards the galactic center.,width=302 ]    as discussed above , the ebl has in first approximation the same energy distribution of the sum of the galactic dust and star emission components , but it has a smaller density , reduced by a factor of approximately 20 with respect to the galactic radiation field in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "it follows that @xmath111 ( for the near universe at @xmath112 ) is approximately equal to the sum of the galactic @xmath113 reduced by an order of magnitude .",
    "this results in a negligible absorption effect for gamma rays that propagate for galactic distances .",
    "the calculation of the gamma ray attenuation requires a numerical integration of the absorption coefficient along the gamma ray trajectory .",
    "it is however possible and instructive to obtain a first order estimate of the size of the effect with some simple considerations .",
    "the order of magnitude of the optical depth due to starlight along a line of sight of length @xmath114 can be estimated as : @xmath115 in this equation @xmath116 is the absorption coefficient at the sun , @xmath117 is the density of starlight photons averaged for all points along the line of sight and @xmath118 is density in the solar neighborhood . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau - stars ] the optical depth is proportional to the absorption coefficient at the sun position , and to an effective length @xmath119 that takes into account the average radiation density along the trajectory .",
    "the maximum absorption coefficient due to starlight in the solar neighborhood is of order @xmath109  kpc@xmath91 . since the linear size of the galaxy is of order 1030  kpc , even if the density of starlight near the galactic center is 1 order of magnitude larger than what we observe near the sun",
    ", one can robustly conclude that the optical depth for any galactic source is at most of order a few @xmath120 , with a small attenuation effect .",
    "an estimate of the optical depth due to the radiation created by dust can be obtained from the analogous of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau - stars ] ) . in this case",
    "the maximum of the absorption coefficient in the solar neighborhood ( obtained for @xmath5  tev ) is of order 0.0098  kpc@xmath91 .",
    "the calculation of the density of infrared radiation in different points in the galaxy is very much simplified by the fact that the galaxy is transparent to infrared radiation , and it is therefore relatively straightforward ( this will be discussed more carefully in the following ) to determine the space distribution of the emission from the angular distribution of the radiation observed at the earth , and therefore the density and angular distribution at any point in the galaxy .",
    "it is also straightforward to see that the quantity @xmath121 converges to a finite result ( that depends on the line of sight ) in the limit @xmath122 ( because the density of photons vanishes sufficiently rapidly at large distances from the galactic center ) .",
    "in fact most of the gamma ray absorption happens near the gc . for lines of sight that pass near the gc",
    "the value of @xmath123 is of order 4050  kpc , while the effective distance to the galactic center is of order 20  kpc .",
    "the absorption due to the dust emitted radiation corresponds therefore ( for an energy of order 100150  tev , where the effect is most important ) to a maximum optical depth of order 0.40.5 for objects in the halo of the galaxy seen via a line of sight that crosses the gc , and to an optical depth of order 0.2 for the gc itself .",

    "the discussion of absorption due to the cmbr is straightforward .",
    "the maximum absorption coefficient ( for @xmath124  pev ) is 0.1415  kpc@xmath91 , and optical depth equal to unity corresponds to the distance @xmath125  kpc .",

    "one source of error derives from the fact that the dust space distribution is more irregular and has much more structure than a simple exponential . the density of the radiation is smoother than the emission , because each point in space receives photons from the entire galaxy , but some `` granularity '' in the density distribution of infrared radiation remains",
    "this has the consequence that the true optical depth along a particular line of sight can differ from the smoothed out estimate calculated in the model by as much as 20%30% .",
    ".,width=302 ]    in addition it also possible that the exponential functional forms that we have used do not capture exactly the average space and temperature distributions of the interstellar dust , especially in the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "for example in @xcite , the authors discuss a model for the space distribution of the dust that has a ( dominant ) exponential term together with a gaussian , which enhances the dust mass density near the gc , and also a narrow `` ring '' of dust of radius @xmath196  kpc .",
    "our model also neglects the spiral structures in the galactic disk .",
    "numerical experiments performed along these lines suggest that without spoiling ( or in fact also improving ) the agreement between data and model , it is possible to change the optical depth for trajectories that traverse the inner part of the galaxy by something that can be as large as 30% .    in our model the optical depth due to the infrared radiation for a gamma ray source at the gc has a maximum value of order @xmath197 ( @xmath194 ) , while the optical depth for a source on the far side of the galaxy is of order @xmath198 ( @xmath6 ) . a variation of @xmath167% of the optical depth results for the first ( second ) case in a difference in the absorption probability @xmath199 ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "in this work we have calculated the attenuation of very high energy gamma rays propagating in the galactic and extragalactic radiation fields . the model for the galactic infrared radiation field that is the crucial element in the estimate of the absorption probabilities",
    "is based on a simple analytic description of the interstellar dust , and has been described in a self  contained form .",
    "it is therefore straightforward to replicate the calculations performed here .",
    "the cmbr is the most important source of target photons , and with a spectrum that peaks at @xmath201  ev , is most effective for absorption at gamma ray energy @xmath182  pev , where the absorption length is 7.07  kpc .",
    "this implies that in the pev energy range the galactic center is visible with an optical depth of order unity , and galactic sources beyond the galactic center are very strongly attenuated . at lower energy",
    "the effects of the cmbr are much less significant . as an illustration ,",
    "the absorption length at 300  tev is 72  kpc , and the effects decrease exponentially for decreasing @xmath38 .    for @xmath202  tev ,",
    "the absorption of gamma rays is dominated by target photons generated inside the galaxy .",
    "this radiation has two main components , starlight and dust emission , which contribute an approximately equal energy density in all points of the galaxy .",
    "the spectra of the two components are however well separated , with starlight photons having an average energy of order @xmath203  ev , and dust emitted photons having an average energy @xmath204  ev .",
    "it follows that starlight photons are most effective in the absorptions of gamma rays with energy @xmath205  tev , while infrared , dust emitted photons are mostly effective for @xmath206  tev .",
    "the number densities of the target photons for the two components differ by a factor of order 50 , and therefore the largest optical depths generated by the two components differ by a factor of the same order .",
    "the infrared radiation can generate optical depths as large as @xmath198 ( or absorption probabilities of order @xmath207 ) for lines of sight that traverse the entire galaxy passing close to the center .",
    "this is clearly an important effect , but the entire galaxy and its halo can be observed also in the energy range where the absorption due to infrared radiation is most important .",
    "absorption due to starlight remains always smaller than 1%2% for gamma rays created in any point of the galaxy , and is in practice of negligible importance .    in this paper",
    "we have discussed a simple model , constructed following very closely the work of misioriotis et al .",
    "@xcite , to compute the dust emitted radiation field using only few parameters .",
    "the model describes well the main features ( in energy , space and angle ) of the radiation . the original work of misiriotis et al .",
    "considered only the wavelength range @xmath178 m , where the dust emission is well described as a thermal process with a modified blackbody spectral shape .",
    "the emission at shorter wavelength is more difficult to describe , and more dependent on the ( only poorly known ) composition of the dust grains . extending the work of misiriotis et al .",
    "we have included in the model a simplified description of dust emission in the short wavelength range @xmath20850  @xmath4 m that is however adequate for the purpose of computing gamma ray absorption probabilities .",
    "we have applied our model of the dust emitted radiation , together with a simplified description of starlight , and models of the cmbr and ebl to compute the absorption probability for different gamma ray trajectories in the galaxy .",
    "some examples of these calculations are shown in this work and compared with results already existing in the literature .",
    "the agreement is reasonably good .",
    "a limitation of our model ( that is also in common with previous calculations ) is that the interstellar dust spatial distribution is modeled as a smooth exponential with cylindrical symmetry , while the true distribution has a much more complex and irregular form .",
    "it follows that our model can not claim to determine exactly the precise absorption for any individual gamma ray source , however the results can be considered valid for an ensemble of sources , or for the study of a diffuse flux .",
    "the main source of systematic uncertainty in the modeling of the infrared radiation is probably the description of the dust space distribution .",
    "we have estimated the uncertainty for the optical depth due to infrared radiation in the directions where it is largest ( when the line of sight passes close the gc ) as of order @xmath20930% .",
    "this corresponds to an uncertainty on the absorption probability @xmath7 .",
    "a comment is in order about the effects of the angular distribution of the photons that form the isrf .",
    "the angular distribution of these photons is strongly anisotropic , with the flux concentrated in a narrow band of galactic latitude , and a significant flow of the radiation outward from the galactic center . for gamma rays arriving from the galactic center neglecting the correct angular distributions of the target photons results in an error for the absorption probability of @xmath210 .    in conclusion",
    ", the absorption of very high energy gamma rays with @xmath0  tev by pair production interactions effectively precludes extragalactic observations , but galactic astronomy remains possible and very promising .",
