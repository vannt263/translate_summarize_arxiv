    "the dynamical and thermal relaxation timescales are very short compared to the stellar lifetime , and thus apart from some mass - loss in very close collisions , the star is largely unaffected .",
    "it is however more difficult for the star to shed the excess angular momentum since magnetic breaking operates on timescales of the order of the stellar lifetime ( gray @xcite ) .",
    "high rotation is therefore the longest lasting dynamical after - effect of a close encounter .",
    "the possibility that stars in bh cusps are rapid rotators may have interesting implications for their evolution and the interpretation of their observed properties .",
    "the effects of rotation and rotationally induced mixing in a main - sequence ( ms ) star on its subsequent evolution has been studied by sweigart ( @xcite ) and vandenberg , larson & de propris ( @xcite ) in the context of globular clusters , without specifying the origin of the rotation , and by sills , pinsonneault & terndrup ( @xcite ) in the context of young open clusters .",
    "rotationally induced mixing may reveal itself in the spectral line ratios , and rotation may be directly observed in the spectral line profiles .",
    "detection of such signatures in the spectra of the observed giants can provide additional evidence for the existence of an underlying cusp of ms stars , which at present can not be directly observed .",

    "the rms change in the stellar angular velocity is given by adding in quadrature the contributions from collisions with different values of the peri - separation @xmath33 and of the orbital energy @xmath34 , weighted by the differential collision rate @xmath35 ,    @xmath36    the differential rate is calculated with the approximation that the relative velocity can be described by the maxwellian distribution function ( df ) with a mass - independent 1d velocity dispersion @xmath37 ( sec .",

    "this reflects the fact that the coupling is strongest when @xmath58 equals the lowest frequency stellar pulsation mode .",
    "in order to extend the linear treatment of the soft encounters to strong ( close and penetrating ) encounters , we simulated such encounters with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) technique ( lucy @xcite ; gingold & monaghan @xcite ) . in view of the difficulty of simulating all the aspects of a real stellar collision , and in view of the many uncertainties in the details of the stellar structure , the purpose of these simulations is not to calculate @xmath26 precisely for specific collisions , but rather to gain _ qualitative _ insight about angular momentum transfer in strong encounters , which can then be incorporated in our semi - analytic calculations by simple approximations .",

    "we find that at smaller peri - separations where significant amounts of mass are ejected in the collisions , a large fraction of the angular momentum that is taken out of the orbit is deposited in the ejecta rather than in the target star .",
    "this truncates the @xmath77 divergence and limits the spin - up efficiency , so that the difference between the analytic calculations and simulation results decreases with @xmath33 until the two cross over .",

    "we now discuss our choice of @xmath78 .",
    "figure  [ fig : deep ] shows that @xmath26 is much more suppressed than @xmath18 at small @xmath33 because the stellar moment of inertia increases as a consequence of the collision .",
    "the increase in @xmath27 far exceeds the small change that is expected due to the stellar oblateness that develops in response to the rotation .",
    "the effect seen in the simulation is due to the heating and subsequent expansion of the star by the collision .",
    "our sph models do not include the radiative processes that are necessary for describing the later stages of cooling and contraction .",
    "it is therefore likely that the final value of @xmath26 is not as strongly suppressed as is implied by figure  [ fig : deep ] , but rather follows more closely the behavior of @xmath18 . a collision with an impactor of a size comparable to that of the target results in much more mass - loss than a collision with an impactor that is effectively a point mass ( e.g. a stellar remnant on a ms star or a ms star on a giant ) .",
    "however , it is likely that the sph results over - estimate the mass - loss since a @xmath54 polytrope has a significantly lower binding energy than the realistic stellar structure models on which we base our analytic calculations ( table  [ tab : stype ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : deep ] shows that the analytic estimate of @xmath26 equals the value derived from the simulation at @xmath81 and @xmath82 for polytrope and point mass impactors , respectively . for @xmath18 the analytic estimate and the simulation results are equal at @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "based on the arguments presented above , we adopt in this work the simple prescription that @xmath84 or the size of the impactor , whichever is larger , for all types of collisions .",
    "we note that the analytic calculations still _ under - estimate _ the sph results by a factor of 2 at @xmath85 , and by a factor of 3 at @xmath86 .",
    "a difference of a similar magnitude is seen also in parabolic collisions ( fig .  [",

    "we do not consider such cases in this work and they are not included in the average @xmath90 ( eq .  [ eq : edwm ] ) . because of the very large stellar density and the proximity of the massive bh , it is necessary to check whether a newly formed binary can survive its first orbital period without being disrupted by a tidal interaction with either a third nearby star or the central bh .",
    "we take this into account by considering the orbit as bound only if the change in the orbital angular momentum , @xmath91 , due to the torque exerted on the system by the third mass @xmath92 ( star or central bh ) is smaller than the orbital angular momentum @xmath93 ,    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the distance of @xmath96 from the binary and where we used the relation @xmath97 . for disruption by a star",

    "the stellar dynamical and thermal relaxation timescales are very short relative to the stellar lifetime and the star can radiate the excess energy quickly .",
    "it is harder to shed the excess angular momentum , since magnetic breaking operates on timescales of order of the stellar lifetime .",
    "thus the direct long term effects of the collision are increased rotation , and possibly some mass - loss and some mixing of the stellar envelope .    in this study we calculated the magnitude of the rotation that is built up in a random walk fashion as the star undergoes multiple hyperbolic tidal encounters .",

    "our approach to the problem was to use detailed stellar structure models to calculate , for the first time , the tidal coupling constants for arbitrary hyperbolic orbits in the linear regime of soft encounters .",

    "( 1 ) at peri - separations closer than about twice the target star s radius , the linear results are smaller than the actual spin - up by a factor of at least two .",
    "( 2 ) once mass - loss becomes significant , the ejecta carries away a large fraction of the angular momentum that is extracted from the orbit , and therefore the spin - up saturates at its level just before the onset of mass - loss .",
    "( 3 ) stars can survive deep collisions down to a peri - separation of half the target star s radius .",
    "( 4 ) a simple tidal disruption criterion for hyperbolic encounters can roughly indicate the point where the fractional mass - loss increases to order unity .",
    "we calculated the spin - up of stars in the inner parsec of the galactic center , which is of special interest because of the high quality and wealth of details of the observed stellar data .",
    "we find that over 10 gyr , @xmath0 ms stars in the inner 0.3 pc are stochastically spun - up to 1030% of the centrifugal break - up velocity ( 2060 times higher than is usual for such stars in the field ) .",
    "this effect decreases only weakly with distance from the bh because the increased tidal coupling at lower collision velocities largely compensates for the decrease in the collision rate at lower stellar densities .",
    "we estimated also the stellar survival probability against head - on collisions over 10 gyr , and found that it was significantly large even very close to the center .",
    "the fact that the spin - up is roughly constant over the volume of the inner gc implies that no large error was introduced by neglecting the fact that stars on non - circular orbits sample a varying stellar density over their lifetime .",
    "the spin - up of giant stars over the giant phase is much smaller , or order 12% of the centrifugal break - up velocity ( doubling the rotation that is usual for such stars in the field).the effect is smaller because of their short lifetime and because of the large ratio between the collision velocity and the stellar escape velocity , which decreases the tidal coupling .",
    "these results suggest that stochastic spin - up is an important stellar effect in bh cusps",
    ". however , several caveats apply .",
    "this results depend on the validity of our extrapolation to the non - linear regime .",
    "a real star is not well represented by an ideal gas @xmath54 polytrope , and more realistic and extensive hydrodynamical simulations , including the effects of radiation and nuclear burning , will be needed to verify our results .",
    "we note however that the @xmath54 polytrope model is significantly less bound than the realistic stellar models ( table  [ tab : stype ] ) .",
    "this implies that our estimates for the minimal peri - separation and the tidal radius may be overly conservative .",
    "in addition , because a smaller binding energy , larger tidal coupling coefficients ( fig .  [",
    "fig : tl ] ) and a larger moment of inertia go hand in hand , the spin - up ( @xmath171 ) is less sensitive to the details of the stellar structure than any of these quantities separately .",
    "another uncertainty in applying our results to any specific system , such as the gc , lies in modeling the pmf of the impactors .",
    "generally , mass segregation will work towards increasing the spin - up effect by pushing the ineffective low mass projectiles out of the central region .",
    "dynamical models of the evolution of the galactic nucleus are required to put this on a quantitative footing .",
    "we considered the survival probability of the stars against head - on collisions , but there are also other effects that may compete against the spin - up , which were not included in our estimate .",
    "magnetic breaking , although slow , may be effective over 10 gyr .",
    "unfortunately , at present the details of this process can not be modeled with any certainty .",
    "the cumulative mass - loss in the course of many non - linear collisions was also not considered .",
    "detailed predictions for the observational consequences of high rotation are outside the scope of this work .",
    "we limit our comments on this matter to noting that rotation lowers the effective temperature and luminosity of a star ( kippenhahn , meyer - hofmeister & thomas @xcite ) , but does not significantly affect the spectral classification of a star until it is close to break - up ( gray @xcite ) .",
    "the long term effects of rotation on stellar evolution may be more significant .",
    "we calculated the effective angular velocity , assuming solid body rotation .",
    "the actual distribution of angular momentum could become stratified over time and lead to rotational support of the core ( vandenberg et al .",
    "@xcite ) or to the replenishment the hydrogen in the core by large scale deep mixing ( sweigart @xcite ) .",
    "these effects will manifest themselves in the giant phase of the stars . finally , we note that even in the gc only the giant stars can be presently observed .",
    "rotational broadening in the giant spectra may be marginally detectable with high resolution spectroscopy , and could bolster the case for the existence of an underlying very dense population of faint stars .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that ms stars in a substantial volume of the dense cusps around massive black holes are likely to rotate at a significant fraction of the centrifugal break - up velocity due to stochastic spin - up by hyperbolic tidal encounters .",
    "following the formalism of press & teukolsky ( @xcite ) , the linear tidal coupling coefficients are expressed as    @xmath172 where @xmath173 are overlap integrals that depend only on the stellar structure .",
    "the orbit enters in the term @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the frequency of the mode , @xmath176 is the angular position of the impactor in a coordinate system centered on the target star ( @xmath177 at periastron ) , and where @xmath178 and @xmath179 the time along the hyperbolic orbit as function of the angle @xmath176 is given by @xmath180 ^{-3/2}\\log \\left [ \\frac{e+\\cos \\phi + ( e^{2}-1)^{1/2}\\sin \\phi } { 1+e\\cos \\phi } \\right ] \\right ) \\ , .\\ ] ]    tables  [ t : qwsun ] and [ t : qwrg ] list the mode frequencies and the overlap integrals for the solar and giant models that we investigate in this work .",
    "the classification of the giant modes is complicated by the large value of the brunt - visl frequency in the core , compared to the @xmath181-mode frequencies , thereby giving rise to a mix of @xmath182 and @xmath183 mode behavior .",
    "the corresponding values for ideal gas @xmath54 , @xmath184 , and @xmath185 polytropes are given in lee & ostriker ( @xcite ) .",
