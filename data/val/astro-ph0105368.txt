    "_ ultra high energy ( uhe ) _ neutrinos can be of accelerator and non - accelerator origin . in the former case _ uhe _ protons accelerated in astrophysical sources produce neutrinos in the chain of @xmath9- and @xmath10-decays , when _ uhe _ protons interact with ambient gas or with low energy photons .",
    "since from observations we know that _ uhe _ protons exist with energies up to @xmath11  ev , the maximum energy of neutrinos is expected up to @xmath12  ev .",
    "astrophysical accelerators are usually connected with shock waves in _ sne _ , _ agns _ , _ grbs _ etc , but there could be also some other mechanisms of acceleration , such as acceleration in the strong electromagnetic wave and in strong electric field due to unipolar inductors ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "non - accelerator sources can provide neutrinos even with higher energies .",
    "these sources include production by topological defects ( first suggested in ref.@xcite ) , by decays of superheavy dark matter particles and by annihilation of superheavy particles .",
    "topological defects in many cases become unstable and decompose to constituent fields , superheavy gauge bosons and higgs particles , which then decay to hadrons and neutrinos",
    ". there could be the examples when the constituent superheavy fields are produced at annihilation ( e.g.  annihilation of monopole - antimonopole connected by string ) .",
    "annihilation of dark matter particles ( e.g.neutralino in _ earth _ and _ sun _ ) gives another source of high energy neutrino production .",
    "the maximum energy of neutrinos from above - mentioned sources can reach the _ gut _",
    "high energy neutrino radiation from all sources is inevitably accompanied by other radiations , most notably by high energy gamma rays . even in cases",
    "when high energy photons are absorbed in the source , their energy is partly transformed into low energy photon radiation : @xmath13-rays and thermal radiation . for sources transparent for high energy gamma radiation the upper limit on diffuse neutrino flux",
    "is imposed by the cascade electromagnetic radiation ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "colliding with microwave photons , high energy photons and electrons give rise to electromagnetic cascades with most of energy being in the observed @xmath14  mev ",

    ". the energy density of this cascade radiation should not exceed , according to _ egret _ observations , @xmath16 ev/@xmath17 . introducing the neutrino energy density for neutrinos with individual energies higher than @xmath18 , @xmath19 ,",
    "it is easy to derive the following chain of inequalities ( from left to right ) : @xmath20 an upper bound on integral neutrino flux immediately follows from eq .",
    "( [ cas ] ) : @xmath21 the latter inequality gives a powerful limit on the possible diffuse neutrino flux .    _",
    "uhe _ neutrinos can be detected at the _ earth _ due to their interactions with nucleons in _ cc _ and _ nc _ reactions , @xmath22where @xmath23 . these processes also modify the observed neutrino spectrum ; neutrinos are both absorbed in ( [ cc ] ) and driven to lower energies in ( [ nc ] ) on their way from a source to a detector @xcite .",
    "cross - sections of @xmath24-scattering are very small as compared with @xmath25-cross - sections .",
    "an important exclusion is the resonant @xmath26-scattering @xcite : @xmath27the resonance energy of neutrino is @xmath28  ev ; the hadrons are produced as a spike with energy @xmath29 .",
    "the number of resonant events in the underground detector with the number of electrons @xmath30 is given by the simple formula @xcite : @xmath31where @xmath32  @xmath33 is the effective cross - section ( @xmath34 is the fermi constant ) and @xmath35 is the solid angle open for a deep underground detector ( within another @xmath35 angle neutrinos are absorbed ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of all above mentioned processes can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as regards @xmath25-cross - sections , especially at extremely high energies , they are unknown yet",
    ". really , to calculate the rate of high - energy events in a neutrino detector one actually needs the differential cross - sections of @xmath36 _ dis _ in the whole range of kinematic variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "such cross - sections , with _",
    "qcd_-effects being taken into account ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , may be expressed in terms of _ parton distribution functions ( pdf ) _ in proton , in our case quarks , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "however , an influence of non - perturbative _ qcd_-effects on nucleon _ structure functions ( sf ) _ at small both @xmath1 and @xmath0 can not be accurately estimated .",
    "it makes one to rely just on theoretical models , i.e.  on various extrapolations .",
    "in fact , differential neutrino - nucleon cross - section can be parameterized with the help of two structure functions , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( see e.g.  ref.s  @xcite ) . in the case of cc scattering ( [ cc ] )",
    "these cross - sections are @xmath43where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the @xmath48 sign corresponds to @xmath49 cross - sections , respectively .",
    "it is useful to decompose the @xmath50 into singlet and non - singlet parts , @xmath51the _ nc _ cross - sections ( [ nc ] ) can be presented in a similar way , with @xmath52 replaced by @xmath53 , @xmath54 replaced by @xmath55 , @xmath56 and with structure functions given by @xmath57the chiral couplings @xmath58 are @xmath59we use @xmath60 .",

    "all these parton distributions were obtained as _ lo / nlo _ solutions of _ dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - atarelli - parisi ( dglap ) _ equations with low @xmath1 distributions @xmath66 taken from experimental data at @xmath67  gev@xmath68 .",
    "the calculated structure functions have been found valid in a wide range of @xmath69 parameter space : @xmath70 _ dglap _ approach is based on perturbative physics .",
    "the smallness of the _ qcd _ coupling constant @xmath71 implies @xmath72 .",
    "the value of @xmath73  gev determines the smallest allowed value of @xmath74 and can be viewed as mass of parton in _ qcd _ cascade .",
    "the minimal value of @xmath0 in perturbative approach is then determined @xmath75 , where @xmath76 for @xmath25-scattering .",
    "however , with @xmath77 increasing the ever smaller values of @xmath78 get important in @xmath25-scattering .",
    "it should be noted , that _ hena _ actually promises the deepest insight in small-@xmath0 physics .",
    "indeed , the record measurements today by _ hera _ @xcite relate to @xmath4 structure function with @xmath79 , while neutrino - nucleon _ sf _ with @xmath80  ev are sensitive to @xmath81 . as _ lo / nlo dglap _ dynamics evolves in @xmath1-direction with @xmath0 being fixed , it provides no information about small-@xmath0 _ sf _ behavior .",
    "moreover , the applicability of _ dglap _ approach to small-@xmath0 physics seems to be questionable .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that _ mellin _ transform of _ dglap _ splitting matrix @xmath82 , @xmath83 , suffers from singularities at @xmath84 . these singularities arise in the perturbative expansion of @xmath85 and @xmath86 in powers of @xmath87 .",
    "nowadays , the only small-@xmath0 solution obtained in the framework of perturbative _ qcd _ is the _",
    "bfkl_-pomeron @xcite .",
    "however , the validity of this asymptotic solution is still to be checked .",
    "though the importance of this approach is widely recognized , there were lately many criticisms of the pure _ bfkl_-pomeron solution ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    a certain modification of _",
    "bfkl_-pomeron description has been proposed in ref .",
    "it includes a unified _ bfkl_/_dglap _ evolution equation with a special _",
    "consistency constraint _ imposed on _ bfkl _ component .",
    "authors applied this approach to calculations of neutrino - nucleon cross - sections and checked manifestations of such solution in _",
    "hena_.    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the different approach to the small-@xmath0 physics , which is developing by _ a. donnachie and p. v. landshoff _ , hereafter _ dl _ , with coauthors @xcite .",
    "it is based on the regge theory inspired description of small-@xmath0 @xmath88-structure function , @xmath4 .",
    "the authors have actually made the simplest possible assumption , namely , that contributions from branch points of the complex @xmath89-plane at @xmath90 are much weaker than those from poles .",
    "this hypothesis gives a rather good description of data and may be regarded as a guideline in @xmath4 small-@xmath0 extrapolation search .",
    "though , predicting the power - law growth of cross - sections at high energies , this approach violates the unitarity .    according to _ dl _ , @xmath4 may be written down as a sum of three factorized terms , @xmath91where @xmath92 and @xmath93 relate to the so - called _",
    "pomeron _ , _",
    "soft pomeron _ and @xmath94 exchanges , respectively .",
    "shapes of @xmath95 and values of @xmath96 are parameters ; they are to be chosen so that to better fit the data .",
    "one of the best and the most convenient for our purposes set of @xmath95 , viz.@xmath97was proposed in ref .  @xcite . with @xmath98it describes @xmath99 data points with @xmath100 per point .",
    "it is worthy of note , that authors of this approach rather prefer fits with @xmath101 at high @xmath1 @xcite . in spite of slightly higher @xmath102 , such fits are very attractive since their _ hard pomeron _",
    "term looks similar to the perturbative _ bfkl _ solution .",
    "however , the direct identification of these two pomerons seems to remain dubious .    in the most recent version @xcite of their approach a. donnachie and p. v. landshoff",
    "propose a new parameterization of @xmath4 data .",
    "they have reduced the number of free parameters by including of the real photon cross - section data , @xmath103 .",
    "authors argue that this new fit gives a good description of data also for @xmath104 and for @xmath105  gev@xmath68 . with no additional parameters ,",
    "they describe successfully the charm _ sf _ , @xmath106 , as well .",
    "however , in the new fit authors use again the power - law dependence of coefficient @xmath107 ( [ hardp ] ) at high @xmath1 .",
    "it works good at small @xmath1 , which are characteristic for photoproduction processes , but it does not extend to @xmath108 , which are typical for @xmath25-scattering at @xmath109 . such power - law behavior of the _ hard _ pomeron term can not be reconciled with the quasi - logarithmic dependence on @xmath1 of _ dglap _ _ sf _ at high @xmath1",
    ". therefore we can not directly apply this new successful parameterization to the description of @xmath110-cross - sections",
    ". maybe it will be possible after a slight modification of the form of _ hard pomeron _ coefficient , which would coincide at small @xmath1 with the original one .",
    "but in this paper we are to use the previous , logarithmic , parameterization ( [ f2dl])-([dlpar ] ) .    in fact , all descriptions of small-@xmath0 _ sf _ are basically extrapolations with certain merits and demerits . in this paper",
    "we construct one more set of structure functions @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "we want them    1 .   to be defined in the whole range of variables @xmath37 and @xmath115 ; 2 .   to comprise both perturbative at high-@xmath0 description , viz._cteq5 _",
    "@xcite , and non - perturbative at low-@xmath0 pure _ regge _ theory approach of _ dl _ ; 3 .   to be smooth over both variables with limited change of first derivative over @xmath116 in the interpolation zone .",
    "hereafter we call this approach _",

    "these _ sf _ smoothly shoot to the low-@xmath0 region from the _ cteq5 _",
    "defined high-@xmath0 one .",
    "starting values of functions and of their logarithmic derivatives over @xmath0 in such extrapolation are taken at the @xmath122 boundary of _",
    "according to ( [ sigf2],[f2nccont],[f3nccont ] ) , neutrino - nucleon cross - sections depend just on @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 _ sf _ , which quark contents is given by ( [ qcf2]-[qcf3s ] ) .",
    "however , the best small-@xmath0 data relate to @xmath4 .",
    "being just different combinations of quark density distributions , @xmath39 , these functions are bound indirectly .",
    "so , it is strongly desirable to make use of this information .",
    "let s first obtain the united , smooth over @xmath0 and @xmath1 , structure function @xmath4 , with small-@xmath0 behavior being in accordance with _ dl _ description ( [ f2dl]-[faexch ] ) and with large-@xmath0 one being determined by _",

    "in fact , the _ cteq5 _ @xmath1-dependence of @xmath111 at high @xmath1 and @xmath127 is close to logarithmic , but different ; it rather looks like @xmath128 with @xmath129 .",
    "so , despite both functions fit to the same _ hera _ data at @xmath130 , and therefore should coincide in a wide range of @xmath1 , they inevitably disperse at large @xmath1 . to reduce this discrepancy",

    "it is important , that at large @xmath1 and @xmath138 both descriptions practically do not disperse .    on having",

    "the @xmath0-dependencies of these parameterizations are different . to meet them smoothly",
    ", we undertake an interpolation between @xmath139 and @xmath140 with the help of cubic over @xmath141 polynomials ; these procedure assures the first derivatives to be continuous in the whole interpolation zone .",
    "so , keeping one border of the interpolation zone at @xmath142 and varying the shape of another border , we call the latter @xmath143 , one gets a set of different interpolations .",
