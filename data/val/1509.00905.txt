    "elliptic partial differential equations ( pdes ) with discontinuous coefficients and singular source terms , commonly referred to as elliptic interface problems , occur in many applications , including fluid dynamics @xcite , material science @xcite , electromagnetics @xcite , biological systems , @xcite and heat or mass transfer @xcite . since the pioneer work of peskin in 1977 @xcite ,",
    "lots of attention has been paid to this field in the past few decades @xcite .",
    "an elliptic interface problem is formulated as elliptic pdes defined on piecewise - smooth subdomains , which are coupled together via interface conditions , such as given jumps in solution and flux across the domain interface . without the interface , a large variety of convergent numerical schemes are available for solving the elliptic pdes , such as , finite difference method ( fdm ) , finite element method ( fem ) , finite volume method ( fvm ) , wavelet , radial basis functions , meshless and spectral methods . however , for elliptic interface problems , the direct application of the aforementioned schemes can not yield a convergent solution .",
    "peskin proposed the immersed boundary method ( ibm ) @xcite in order to simulate flow pattern of blood in the heart , in which he approximated the singular sources on the interface . since his work , many numerical methods have been proposed and studied . in 1984 , mayo introduced a second order integral equation approach for poisson s equation and biharmonic equation on irregular domains @xcite , in which the solution is extended to a rectangular region by using fredholm integral equations . a fast poisson solver is utilized to solve the resulting fredholm integral equations on a rectangular region .",
    "continuous derivatives have been assumed to evaluate the discrete laplacian .",
    "this method can deal with jump conditions of @xmath2 \\neq 0 $ ] and @xmath3=0 $ ] when the green s function is available . in 1994 , a level set method in combination with the immersed boundary method @xcite is proposed by osher and his coworkers in order to compute solutions to incompressible two - phase flow .",
    "this level set method is easy to implement , although it is of low convergent rate . in the same year ,",
    "immersed interface method ( iim ) was proposed by levique and li @xcite , in which the interface conditions are incorporated into the finite difference scheme near the interface to achieve second order accuracy based on a taylor expansion in a local coordinate system .",
    "it is a second order interface scheme that does not smear the interface jumps and is used to solve elliptic and parabolic interface problems alike .",
    "the resulting linear system is sparse , but not symmetric or positive definite .",
    "also , second order derivatives of the interface jumps are needed .",
    "the iim is widely used in practice and its extensions can be seen in refs .",
    "@xcite . for instance , in 2001 , li and ito @xcite constructed an iim scheme with resulting linear matrix being diagonally dominate and its symmetric part being negative definite .",
    "in addition to the iim , a large class of finite difference based numerical methods have also been proposed for solving elliptic interface problem .",
    "the crucial idea of these methods is to incorporate jump conditions into the difference stencils near the interface to maintain high order local truncation error using taylor expansion .",
    "numerical schemes based on finite element or finite volume are also developed @xcite .",
    "finite element schemes are usually constructed by modifying the finite element basis near the interface . a few methods on unfitted mesh have been introduced based on the discontinuous galerkin method using interior penalty technique to handle jump and flux conditions @xcite . the weak galerkin finite element method has also been developed for elliptic interface problem @xcite .",
    "other interesting methods developed in recent decades include the ghost fluid method ( gfm ) by fedkiw , osher and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the second order convergence of finite difference formalism of interface methods is proved in 2006 by beale and layton for smooth interface @xcite , whereas convergence analysis of most elliptic interface schemes is yet to be done .    in the past decade , we have dedicated ourselves to designing accurate and robust numerical schemes for solving elliptic interface problems . in 2006 , the matched interface and boundary ( mib ) method @xcite was proposed , motivated by many practical needs , such as optical molecular imaging @xcite , nano - electronic devices , @xcite , vibration analysis of plates @xcite , wave propagation @xcite , geodynamics @xcite and electrostatic potential in proteins @xcite .",
    "one important feature of the mib method is its extension of computational domains by using the so called fictitious values , an strategy developed in our earlier methods for handling boundaries @xcite and interfaces @xcite .",
    "as such , standard central finite difference schemes can be employed to discretize differential operators as if there were no interface .",
    "another unique feature of the mib method is to repeatedly enforce only the lowest order jump conditions to achieve higher order convergence , which is of critical importance for the robustness of the method to deal with arbitrarily complex interface geometries .",
    "higher - order jump conditions must involve higher order derivatives and/or cross derivatives .",
    "therefore , to approximate higher order derivatives and/or cross derivatives , one must utilize larger stencils , which is unstable for constructing high - order interface schemes and cumbersome for complex interface geometries .",
    "the other distinct feature of the mib method is its dimensional splitting . to enforce a 2d or 3d interface jump condition",
    ", we divide the problem into multi 1d ones and resolve a 1d problem at a time , if possible .",
    "this approach enables us to come up with a systematic procedure to resolve high dimensional interface problems .",
    "finally , based on high order lagrange polynomials , the mib method is of arbitrarily high order in principle .",
    "for example , mib schemes up to 16th order accurate have been constructed for simple interface geometries 1d and 2d domains @xcite , and sixth - order accurate mib schemes have been developed for complex interfaces in 2d @xcite and 3d domains @xcite .",
    "recently we have constructed an adaptively deformed mesh based mib @xcite and a galerkin formulation of mib @xcite to improve mib s capability of solving realistic problems .",
    "a comparison of the gfm , iim and mib methods can be found in in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the mib method has been used in our earlier works for solving many scientific and engineering problems , such as poisson - boltzmann equation ( pbe ) @xcite for describing the electrostatic potential in proteins . to our best knowledge",
    ", the mib method is the only method that has demonstrated the second order accuracy for solving poisson or pb equation with realistic protein surfaces with geometric singularities @xcite and for solving poisson equation with multiple material interfaces @xcite .",
    "it can also be used to solve the helmholtz equation for wave scattering and propagation in inhomogeneous media .",
    "a fourth order mib scheme for the helmholtz equation with arbitrarily curved interfaces has been proposed by zhao @xcite .",
    "another example is the geodynamics where the navier - stokes equations with discontinuous viscosity and density is to be solved .",
    "et al _ have developed a second order accurate mib method to solve this problem on non - staggered cartesian grids @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the elastic interface problem in both 2d and 3d domains with arbitrarily complex interface geometry was also addressed by the mib method @xcite . in the past few years",
    ", the mib method has also been applied to the optical molecular imaging @xcite , nano - electronic devices , @xcite and vibration analysis of plates @xcite .",
    "due to the importance and complexity of interface problems , it is still urgent to develop methods that are more accurate , robust and require less computational cost",
    ". finite volume method ( fvm ) is known for its ability to better conserve mass and flux in conservation law problems .",
    "this property is fundamental for the simulation of many physical models , e.g. , oil recovery simulation and computational fluid dynamics in general .",
    "additionally , compared with finite difference method which takes a collocation formulation , fvm is able to deal with solutions with relatively lower regularity . in the present work ,",
    "we propose the finite volume formulation of the mib method ( mib - fvm ) .",
    "the motivation for the proposed mib - fvm is to inherit the merits of both methods , namely , the capability of the mib method in handling complex interface geometries and the advantage of fvm for conservation laws and low solution regularity .    the rest of this paper is organized as the follows . in section [ theory_and_alg ] , the general theory of the mib based finite volume formulation is briefly discussed .",
    "the theoretical formulation and the computational algorithms are given as well . in section [ mib ]",
    ", we present the strategy for treating complex interface geometries . in section [ numericalstudies ] ,",
    "the proposed mib - fvm is validated by benchmark tests , such as 6-petal flower and jigsaw puzzle - like shape in two dimensional ( 2d ) space , and sphere , ellipsoid , cylinder , flower - based cylinder and torus in three dimensional ( 3d ) space .",
    "solutions of less regularity ( @xmath4 continuous ) are also tested for the spherical and ellipsoidal interface in 3d .",
    "this paper ends with a conclusion .",
    "let us consider an open bounded domain @xmath5 with a given interface @xmath6 , which separates the domain into two subdomains , @xmath7 and @xmath8 as illustrated in figure [ interface ] .",
    "is divided by interface @xmath6 into two subdomains , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the mesh is represented by solid lines .",
    "the grid points are represented by blue dots.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the boundary @xmath9 and interfaces @xmath6 may be non - smooth .",
    "the interface can be characterized by a piecewise smooth level - set function @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 . as such",
    ", two subdomains can be given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the elliptic interface problem can be formulated as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a piecewise continuous function , @xmath16 is the boundary value , and @xmath17 is a variable coefficient that is discontinuous across the interface @xmath6 . as a result",
    ", two jump conditions are required to make the problem well posed @xmath18         & =   u^+ - u^-      = \\phi,~      \\forall { \\bf x } ~{\\rm on } ~\\gamma\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath19     & =    \\beta^+ u_n^+ - \\beta^- u_n^-    =   \\psi,~   \\forall { \\bf x } ~{\\rm on } ~\\gamma,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote their limiting value from the @xmath7 side of the interface @xmath6 , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote their limiting value from the @xmath8 side of the interface @xmath6 .",
    "the derivatives @xmath24 and @xmath25 are evaluated along the outer normal direction on the interface . here",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 is at least @xmath28 continuous .",
    "equations ( [ theoryeq1])-([jumpcondition2 ] ) define the elliptic interface problem to be solved in the present work .      to avoid the time - consuming mesh generation procedure , like the original mib method",
    ", we employ the cartesian mesh .",
    "we also employ the vertex - centered finite volume method , which means that we associates control volumes and unknowns to vertices .",
    "the control volumes are cubes whose centers are located at the grid points and whose sides intercept at the midpoints between grid points , which is illustrated by the left chart of figure [ cv ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in both cases , the second order derivatives of @xmath29 blow up at the origin , making the solution only @xmath4 continuous in @xmath8 . since the differential form , eq .",
    "( [ theoryeq1 ] ) , is of second order for the diffusion term , mathematically , eq .",
    "( [ theoryeq1 ] ) is invalid even though the underlying conservation law is still valid .",
    "however , it is noticed that the equivalent term in the integral form , eq .",
    "( [ integralform1 ] ) , involves only the first order derivative .",
    "this reduction of the derivative order is important in dealing with solution which changes so rapidly in space that the spatial derivative does not exist . for these reasons ,",
    "the finite volume method is preferred over the finite difference method in solving problems whose solution has less regularity and exhibits local discontinuities .    in case 8(a ) , we choose constant diffusive coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath23 , whereas in case 8(b ) , @xmath21 and @xmath23 are both position dependent . the numerical solutions and the @xmath0 errors of case 8(a ) and case 8(b ) are depicted in figure [ h2sphere_pic ] and figure [ h2ellipsoid_pic ] , respectively . from the numerical results collected in table [ h2sphere_tab ] and table [ h2ellipsoid_tab ]",
    ", it is seen that the second order accuracy in both cases are essentially obtained .",
    "in this work , we introduce the finite volume formulation of matched interface and boundary method ( mib - fvm ) for solving elliptic interface problems arising from modeling material interface in practice . much effort has been taken to develop advanced numerical schemes for such problems in the past few decades .",
    "however , challenges still remain in this field .",
    "one of the challenge concerns the development of methods with higher order accuracy .",
    "another challenge is to develop methods for dealing with complex interface geometries .",
    "the matched interface and boundary ( mib ) method has been proved to be able to deal with these challenges . however , since the mib method is based on the collocation formulation , it does not work well for solutions with low regularity .",
    "based on the integral form rather than the differential form , the finite volume method ( fvm ) is known for being able to deal with problems with low regularity solutions and better conserve mass and flux .",
    "second order finite volume methods have also been formulated in literature for elliptic interface problems",
    ". motivated by these successes , we propose the present mib - fvm to take the advantages of mib and fvm .",
    "to reduce the computational cost of mesh generation , we utilize the cartesian mesh , although the proposed mib - fvm can be realized on irregular meshes as well .",
    "we also employ the vertex - centered fvm , for which the cubic control volumes are associated with the grid point at the center .",
    "the control volumes are categorized into regular and irregular types , where special treatments of the mib formulation are needed for the irregular ones in order to maintain the designed accuracy .",
    "we study the proposed mib - fvm by a number of classical test cases , including both 2d cases such as 6-petal flower and jigsaw - puzzle like shape , and 3d cases such as sphere , ellipsoid , standard cylinder , flower - based cylinder and torus .",
    "the numerical results all demonstrate the second order accuracy of the proposed method .",
    "the ability of handling interface with complex geometries and solutions with low regularity ( @xmath4 continuous ) indicates that the proposed mib - fvm combines the advantage of both mib and fvm in meeting numerical challenges .",
