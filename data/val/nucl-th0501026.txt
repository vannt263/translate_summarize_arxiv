    "the distributions of mesons at large transverse momenta in @xmath11 or @xmath12 collisions are usually calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd using collinear factorization ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while the shape at transverse momenta larger than 2 - 4 gev can be relatively well explained , the difference between the data and the lowest - order computation is quantified in terms of a so - called k - factor , independent quantity for each energy @xcite .",

    "quite different approaches have been used to describe the particle spectra from the nuclear collisions @xcite . the model in ref.@xcite with an educated guess for ugd describes surprisingly well the whole charged particle rapidity distribution by means of gluonic mechanisms only .",
    "such a gluonic mechanism would lead to identical production of positively and negatively charged hadrons .",
    "the recent results of the brahms experiment concerning heavy ion collisions @xcite show that the @xmath18 and @xmath19 ratios differ from unity .",
    "this put into question the successful description of ref.@xcite . in the light of this experiment ,",
    "it becomes obvious that the large rapidity regions have more complicated flavour structure . at lower energies these ratios",
    "are known to differ from unity drastically @xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite one of us has calculated inclusive pion spectra in proton - proton collisions based on different models of unintegrated gluon distributions taken from the literature . in the present paper in addition to the @xmath0 mechanism",
    "we include also @xmath20 and @xmath21 mechanisms and similar ones for antiquarks in order to obtain a fully consistent description .",
    "many unintegrated gluon distributions in the literature are ad hoc parametrizations of different sets of experimental data rather than derived from qcd .",

    "when extending running @xmath71 to the region of small scales we use a parameter free analytic model from ref.@xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was assumed , based on the concept of local parton - hadron duality , that the rapidity distribution of particles is identical to the rapidity distribution of gluons . in the present approach we follow a different approach which makes use of phenomenological fragmentation functions ( ff s ) . in the following we assume @xmath72 .",

    "as an illustration of the formalism , in the present paper , we shall show results for energies adequate for cern sps i.e. for the energies at which the missing mechanisms should play an important role .    before we adress the distributions of pions we wish to discuss the inclusive spectra of `` produced '' partons .      in the familiar collinear approach",
    "the contributions of diagrams involving quarks and antiquarks are not negligible even at large energies .",
    "a nice , quantitative discussion of this issue can be found in @xcite . in this section",
    "we shall make a similar analysis in our approach based on ccfm updf s . in fig.[fig : partons_xf ] we display the contributions of partons ( gluons , quarks , and antiquarks ) for all diagrams of fig.[fig : diagrams ] for the center - of - mass energy w = 17.3 gev , i.e. energy of recent experiments of the na49 collaboration at cern as a function of jet ( minijet ) @xmath4 .",
    "the parton rapidity is related to the parton @xmath4 as follows @xmath90 where the parton mass here is the same as in eq.([x1_x2 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding cross section is obtained by integration over parton transverse momenta in the interval 0.2 gev @xmath91 4 gev .",
    "the @xmath0 contribution , claimed to be the dominant contribution at rhic @xcite , is somewhat smaller than the contribution of diagrams @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the contribution of diagram @xmath92 ( dashed line ) dominates at negative feynman-@xmath4 , while the contribution of diagram @xmath93 ( dotted line ) at positive feynman-@xmath4 . by symmetry requirements @xmath94 . in order to understand the intriguing asymmetry in @xmath4 of contributions of diagrams @xmath92 and @xmath93 , in fig.[fig : b - decomposition_xf ] we present a further decomposition of the @xmath92 contribution into sea - glue , valence - glue subcontributions and correspondingly of the @xmath93 contribution into glue - sea , glue - valence subcontributions .",
    "this decomposition shows that the sea - glue and glue - sea contributions are of similar size as the valence - glue and glue - valence , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note a different @xmath4-asymmetry of the contributions involving sea and valence quarks .",

    "for the two contributions one obtains a rather similar functional behaviour .",
    "it is worth noticing that in contrast to the standard collinear case in our approach the partonic cross section is fully integrable .",
    "this seems promissing in extending the region of applicability of the `` perturbative '' or the scale of parton distributions .",
    "] qcd towards smaller transverse momenta of hadrons .",
    "the rise of the cross section above @xmath96 0.5 gev is due to a rapid increase of gluonic radiation above @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the minimal factorization scale for the grv parton distributions . on the other hand ,",
    "the rise of the cross section towards @xmath99 is an artifact of freezing factorization scale below @xmath98 in the conjuction of the singular behaviour of the denominator in the parton cross section formulae . to elucidate this issue somewhat better in fig.[fig : partons_pt_extra ] we present also the results with the second prescription for the factorization scale with the minimal shift of the factorization scale ( dotted line ) and the result with an extra substitution of @xmath100 by @xmath101 ( dashed line ) , where @xmath102 is a new nonperturbative parameter of our model specified in the figure .",
    "the second low - scale prescription lead to a smooth behavior of the partonic cross section at low transverse momenta .",
    "the consequences and the sensitivity to the extra prescription on the pion production at low transverse momenta of hadrons will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the passage from parton distributions to hadron distributions is the next step of our analysis . in the present approach",
    "we shall use the approach based on phenomenological fragmentation functions known from other processes . in the literature",
    "it is mostly @xmath103 hadrons reactions which are used for extraction of phenomenological fragmentation functions .",
    "there are a few sets of fragmentation functions in the literature . in the present calculation we shall use the fragmentation function of kretzer @xcite .",
    "there are two advantages of this particular set of fragmentation functions over other known from the literature .",
    "firstly , the kretzer fragmentation functions are available and reasonable even for very low scales @xmath104 1 gev , or even less , i.e. in the region of our interest .",
    "secondly , more attention in their construction was paid to the flavour structure than in any other approach in the literature .",
    "a good control of the flavour structure is essential when discussing and comparing contributions of diagram @xmath95 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 to the pion momentum distributions .    in fig.[fig :",
    "pions_pt ] we compare our model invariant cross sections for @xmath105 ( left panel ) and @xmath106 ( right panel ) as a function of pion transverse momentum at w = 27.4 gev for different values of the parameter @xmath107 of our gaussian nonperturbative form factor . in principle , our result should not exceed experimental data especially in the perturbative regime of @xmath108 2 gev where the perturbative @xmath109 parton subprocesses are crucial .",
    "this limits the value of the nonperturbative form factor to @xmath110 0.5 gev@xmath111 .",
    "as can be seen from the figure the agreement of our model with experimental data is not perfect .",
    "there can be a few reasons for this fact . in order to understand the problem somewhat better",
    "let us concentrate on a small transverse momentum region @xmath112 2 gev .",
    "as an example in fig.[fig : pions_small_pt ] we present our results for @xmath107 = 1 gev@xmath111 .",
    "we observe a deficit at @xmath108 0.5 gev and a strong excess at @xmath113 0.3 gev .",
    "it is particularly intriguing which effect stands behind the huge excess at very small transverse momenta .",
    "in addition , in fig.[fig : pions_small_pt ] we present contributions of different disjoint and complementary regions of variable @xmath80 , as indicated in the figure .",
    "the figure shows that the rapid increase below @xmath104 0.3 gev is caused exclusively by small @xmath114 0.2 i.e. must be traced back to the phenomenological fragmentation functions used .",
    "the kretzer fragmentation functions as calculated from the publicly available computer code @xcite are restricted to factorization scales larger than 1 gev@xmath115 .",
    "therefore in our calculation we were forced to freeze the fragmentation functions below @xmath116 1 gev .",
    "the fragmentation functions at this small scale are shown by the solid line in fig.[fig : kretzer_ff ] for illustration .",
    "a clear rise of the fragmentation functions at small z can be observed , which in conjunction with the previous observation must be responsible for the excess of pions at very small @xmath117 .",
    "the lower limit for the scale of about 1 gev@xmath115 is a recomendation based on analysis of the @xmath118 data rather than a rigorous applicability limit .",
    "in fact , the initial evolution scale in @xcite is @xmath98 = 0.26 gev@xmath115 .",
    "let us try to use the kretzer fragmentation functions at this even lower scale . in fig.[fig",
    ": kretzer_ff ] we show ( dashed line ) the gluon and quark fragmentation functions . while for @xmath119 fragmentation the small - z rise in `` z d(z ) '' completely dissapears and a minimum at z = 0 is obtained ( valence - like character ) , for the quark fragmentation only a saturation of `` z d(z ) '' can be observed . in fig.[fig : pions_small_pt_mu20 ] we show the result for pion production obtained with the fragmentation function at the lowest factorization scale @xmath98 = 0.26 gev@xmath115 . clearly the description of the data is now better .",
    "it is somewhat amusing that even the description above @xmath117 = 0.5 gev is now much better .",
    "it becomes obvious that the choice of the factorization scale is very important in this context .",
    "the description below @xmath117 = 0.2 gev is still rather poor .",
    "this is partially caused by the behaviour of the quark fragmentation functions at small z ( see fig.[fig : kretzer_ff ] ) .",
    "other effects are also possible . for example , we have used a simple one - parameter gaussian form factor . in principle , such form factor may have more complicated functional dependence and can depend not only on the impact parameter , but also on energy and/or @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore the whole formalism with z - dependent fragmentation functions must ultimately break at very low transverse momenta , in particular at small @xmath4 where resonance decays must be treated explicitly .",
    "having this in view our final result seems promissing for further improvements in the future .",
    "inclusion of diagrams @xmath92 and @xmath93 in conjunction with the flavour dependent fragmentation functions lead to the @xmath3 asymmetry .",
    "in fig.[fig : pim_to_pip_pt ] we show the asymmetry as the function of pion transverse momentum . the asymmetry is well described by our model , in contrast to individual distributions .",
    "this seems to suggest the right relative contributions of diagram @xmath95 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the asymmetry depends only weakly on the value of the parameter @xmath107 of the gaussian nonperturbative form factor .    at sps energies it is often customary to use @xmath4 rather than rapidity .",
    "the hadron feynman variable @xmath120 is related to hadron pseudorapidity @xmath74 as @xmath121 and the jacobian of transformation expressed by @xmath120 and @xmath117 is @xmath122 in fig.[fig : pions_xf ] we compare the @xmath4 distributions obtained in our approach for @xmath107 = 1 gev@xmath115 with those from some popular programs available on the market .",
    "the thin and thick ( dashed and dotted ) lines correspond to the different treatment of the scale in the fragmentation functions as described above ( see also the figure caption ) .",
    "clearly some mechanisms at large @xmath4 are missing in our approach .",
    "one of such mechanisms is the so - called pion stripping discussed e.g. in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was not our goal to include all of these effects and describe the experimental data .",
    "our intention here was to identify the dominant mechanisms in the language of unintegrated parton distributions adequate at intermediate and low transverse momenta .    for completeness in fig.[fig",
    ": pions_xf_diag ] we present a decomposition of the pion @xmath4 distribution into the components corresponding to diagrams shown in fig.[fig : diagrams ] .",
    "the purely gluonic contribution ( diagram @xmath95 ) is comparable to the other two contributions at @xmath123 0 , but at @xmath124 0.5 the contributions of diagram @xmath92 and @xmath93 are significantly larger .",
    "similarly as for parton distributions the diagrams @xmath92 and @xmath93 contribute at somewhat larger @xmath125 than the diagram @xmath95 . some differences for @xmath126 and @xmath127 distributions are visible in the figure .",
    "the mechanisms underlying diagrams @xmath92 and @xmath93 are important contributors to understand the @xmath3 asymmetry at small and intermediate values of @xmath4 .",
    "we think , however , that the dominant mechanism of @xmath126 and @xmath127 asymmetry in very forward ( @xmath128 0.5 ) and very backward ( @xmath129 -0.5 ) hemispheres is due to the pion stripping mechanism ( for a reference see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the approach based on unintegrated gluon distributions was applied recently to describe particle momentum distributions at rhic for nucleus - nucleus @xcite and proton - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "we propose new mechanisms , neglected so far in the literature , which involve also quark / antiquark degrees of freedom and are based on ( anti)quark - gluon and gluon-(anti)quark fusion processes followed by the subsequent fragmentation .",
    "these missing mechanisms have been estimated in the approach based on unintegrated parton ( gluon , quark , antiquark ) distributions originating from the solution of a set of coupled equations proposed recently by kwieciski and coworkers .",
    "the formalism proposed recently by kwieciski is very useful to obtain not only gluon unintegrated distributions but also their counterparts for quarks and antiquarks .    in the present paper we have concentrated on low energies @xmath130 20 gev , relevant for sps experiments . by freezing relevant scales for small parton transverse momenta",
    "we achieve a reasonable description of the data down to pion transverse momenta @xmath25 0.5 gev .",
    "the missing terms lead to an asymmetry in the production of the @xmath126 and @xmath127 mesons . while at lower energies of the order of 20  50 gev such an asymmetry has been observed experimentally , it was not yet studied at rhic .",
    "the brahms collaboration at rhic has a potential to study the asymmetries .",
    "such asymmetries may be also useful to pin down the non - gluonic mechanisms as those encoded in diagrams @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the non - ideal agreement with the experimental data at low @xmath5 can be due to approximate treatment of nonperturbative effects embodied in the form factors , as well as in the treatment of hadronization effects with the help of scale - dependent one - parameter fragmentation functions .",
