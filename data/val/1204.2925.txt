    "as the world s demands for energy keep growing , corresponding researches on developing new energy sources or enhancing the energy - consuming efficiency are attracting more and more attentions . until now , the fissile nuclear reactor is still a very important energy source , in which uranium dioxide ( uo@xmath0 ) has been the main fuel component for many years @xcite .",
    "however , during the burning cycle of uo@xmath0 , considerable amounts of redioactive elements emerge in the reaction waste @xcite . and such radioactive waste results in very troublesome long - term storage requirements .",
    "based on these facts , many efforts have been done to look for possible substitutions of uo@xmath0 .",
    "thorium based materials , which are naturally abundant , are identified as good candidates for replacing uo@xmath0 in fissile nuclear reactors because they are able to produce fewer transuranic ( tru ) compared to uranium- and plutonium - based fuels .",
    "and although @xmath2th is not fissile , it can absorb a slow neutron and then form fissile @xmath2u just undergoing multiple beta - decays @xcite .",
    "moreover , because of the good solubility between thorium dioxide ( tho@xmath0 ) and other transuranic dioxides , using the mix oxides ( mox ) of thorium and plutonium in nuclear reactors can also help reducing the large plutonium stockpile while maintaining acceptable safety and control characteristics of the reactor system @xcite . in comparison with previous uranium - based fuels ,",

    "the formation energy results indicate that without any shifts of the fermi energy , the interstitial th@xmath107 defect is very probable to appear in tho@xmath0 with an energy release of 1.74 ev . with changing the fermi energy to different values ,",
