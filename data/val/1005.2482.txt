    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in nonperturbative regime has two fundamental properties : chiral symmetry is dynamically broken and color charges are confined .",
    "the interplay between chiral symmetry breaking and confinement as well as the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions at finite temperature and density are of continuous interests @xcite .",
    "these two transitions are characterized by the breaking and restoration of chiral and center symmetry , which are well defined in two extreme quark mass limits . in the chiral limit when the current quark mass is zero @xmath5 ,",
    "the chiral condensate is the order parameter for the chiral phase transition .",
    "when the current quark mass goes to infinity @xmath6 , qcd becomes pure gauge @xmath7 theory , which is center symmetric in the vacuum , and the usually used order parameter is the polyakov loop @xcite .",
    "the relation between the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions is very important for the phase diagram at high baryon density region @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite that in large @xmath8 limit , a confined but chiral symmetric phase , which is called quarkyonic phase can exist in the high baryon density region .",
    "it is very interesting to study whether this quarkyonic phase can survive in real qcd phase diagram , and how it competes with nuclear matter and the color superconducting phase .",
    "( it is noticed that in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that at zero chemical potential , the lattice results for the thermodynamical properties have a very mild dependence on the number of colors . )",
    "lattice qcd at the current stage can not go to very high baryon density . for zero chemical potential",
    ", previous lattice results show that these two transitions occur at the same temperature , e.g , in ref .",

    "rbc - bielefeld group @xcite and wuppertal - budapest group @xcite have studied the chiral and deconfinement phase transition temperatures with almost physical quark masses .",
    "the rbc - bielefeld group claimed that the two critical temperatures for @xmath9 coincide at @xmath10 .",
    "the wuppetal - budapest group found that for the case of @xmath9 , there are three transition temperatures , the transition temperature for chiral restoration of @xmath11 quarks @xmath12 , the transition temperature for chiral restoration of @xmath13 quark @xmath14 and the deconfinement transition temperature @xmath15 . from this result , we can read that the critical temperatures for different transitions are different . according to the wuppetal - budapest group ,",
    "this is the consequence of the crossover nature .    in the framework of qcd",
    "effective models , there is still no dynamical model which can describe the chiral symmetry breaking and confinement simultaneously .",
    "the main difficulty of effective qcd model to include confinement mechanism lies in that it is difficult to calculate the polyakov loop analytically .",
    "currently , the popular models used to investigate the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions are the polyakov nambu - jona - lasinio model ( pnjl ) @xcite and polyakov linear sigma model ( plsm ) @xcite . however , the shortcoming of these models is that the temperature dependence of the polyakov - loop potential is put in by hand from lattice result , which can not be self - consistently extended to finite baryon density .",
    "recently , efforts have been made in ref.@xcite to derive a low - energy effective theory for confinement - deconfinement and chiral - symmetry breaking / restoration from first - principle .",
    "recent investigation revealed that quark propagator , heat kernels can also act as an order parameter as they transform non trivially under the center transformation related to deconfinement transition @xcite .",
    "but the exciting result is the behavior of spectral sum of the dirac operator under center transformation @xcite .",
    "a new order parameter , called dressed polyakov loop has been defined which can be represented as a spectral sum of the dirac operator @xcite . it has been found the infrared part of the spectrum particularly plays a leading role in confinement @xcite .",
    "this result is encouraging since it gives a hope to relate the chiral phase transition with the confinement - deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the order parameter for chiral phase transition is related to the spectral density of the dirac operator through banks - casher relation @xcite .",
    "therefore , both the dressed polyakov loop and the chiral condensate are related to the spectral sum of the dirac operator .",
    "behavior of the dressed polyakov loop is mainly studied in the framework of lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "apart from that , studies based on dyson - schwinger equations @xcite and pnjl model @xcite have been carried out . in those studies",
    "the role of dressed polyakov loop as an order parameter is discussed at zero chemical potential . in this work",
    ", we will investigate the deconfinement phase transition by using the dressed polyakov loop as an equivalent order parameter in the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model . as we know",
    ", the njl model lacks of confinement and the gluon dynamics is encoded in a static coupling constant for four point contact interaction .",
    "however , assuming that we can read the information of confinement from the dual chiral condensate , it would be interesting to see the behavior of the dressed polyakov loop in a scenario without any explicit mechanism for confinement .    in this work we study the phase transitions in the njl model in @xmath0 plane in chiral limit as well for small quark mass limit .",

    "= 7.5 cm = 6.5 cm    in the case of first order chiral phase transition , the situation is more complicated .",
    "due to the discontinuity of @xmath68 at the first order chiral phase transition point , the temperature derivative of the dressed polyakov loop can be expressed as @xmath69 where , the first term is determined by the regular behavior of @xmath65 ( see fig.[fig - firstderi-1order ] ) , the second term is due to @xmath70 , the jump of @xmath68 at the first order phase transition point at @xmath71 . when @xmath72 , the second term vanishes",
    ". now we consider two limiting cases .",
    "first , in the case of a weak first order phase transition , @xmath70 is small and @xmath61 around @xmath66 is large , as showed in fig.[fig - firstderi-1order ] .",
    "so the first term dominates the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq.dpl1st ] ) and gives the similar result as that in the case of a second order chiral phase transition .",
    "second , in the case of a strong first order chiral phase transition , @xmath70 is large and @xmath61 is small .",
    "so the second term dominates the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq.dpl1st ] ) . then @xmath73 is strongly dependent on the detailed information of @xmath74 .",
    "our numerical results show that @xmath74 decreases as temperature increases , and so the second term also gives a decreasing contribution . in all , it is clear that @xmath67 gets its maximum at @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath57 and @xmath63 coincide in the case of a weak first order chiral phase transition due to remnants of second order chiral phase transition .",
    "the coincidence in the case of a general first order chiral phase transition is supported by our numerical results and can be generally expected .",
    "= 7.5 cm = 6.5 cm    for the case with finite quark mass and small chemical potential , we have no phase transitions but crossover .",
    "so let us consider the second temperature derivative of the dressed polyakov loop @xmath75 whose zero point determines the transition temperature @xmath76 .",
    "[ fig - derivative ] shows the second derivatives of the general chiral condensate @xmath77 at three temperature cases : @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the chiral transition temperature .",
    "similar to our previous observation , large values of @xmath77 appear around @xmath82 ( see the two maximums in fig . [ fig - derivative ] ) , as remnants of the second order phase transition in chiral limit .",

    "@xmath77 around the two maximums dominate the integral in eq.([eq.dpl1 ] ) and @xmath84 does not change its sign . above @xmath81 , the negative part around the minimum cancels the contributions from the maximums , and up to a certain temperature @xmath57 , this cancelation leads to the zero of the integral in eq.([eq.dpl2 ] ) . in all",
    ", the zero point of @xmath84 comes from the negative contribution of the minimum at @xmath85 , so the transition temperature related with the dressed polyakov loop must be greater than the chiral transition temperature , i.e. @xmath86 .",
    "we investigate the chiral condensate and the dressed polyakov loop or dual chiral condensate at finite temperature and density in the two - flavor nambu  jona - lasinio model .",
    "we find the behavior of dressed polyakov loop in absence of any confinement mechanism still shows an order parameter like behavior .",
    "it is found that in the chiral limit , the critical temperature for chiral phase transition coincides with that of the dressed polyakov loop . in the case of explicit chiral symmetry breaking , it is found that the critical temperature for chiral transition @xmath1 is smaller than that of the dressed polyakov loop @xmath2 in the low baryon density region where the transition is a crossover . with the increase of current quark mass the difference between the two critical temperatures",
    "is found to be increasing .",
    "however , the two critical temperatures coincide in the high baryon density region where the phase transition is of first order .    from symmetry analysis ,",
    "the dressed polyakov loop can be regarded as an equivalent order parameter of deconfinement phase transition for confining theory . in the njl model , the gluon dynamics",
    "is encoded in a static coupling constant for four point contact interaction . since in this work",
    "we have included only quark degrees of freedom , a quantitative comparison will not match with other results .",
    "but the interesting fact is that the qualitative features ( angle variation , temperature variation ) of the dressed polyakov loop remains the same .",
    "moreover , we expect that independent of the input of gluedynamics to the quark propagator , it is a general feature for @xmath3 in the case of 1st and 2nd order phase transitions , and @xmath4 in the case of crossover , which qualitatively agrees with the lattice result in ref .",
    "this might indicate that for full qcd , in the crossover case , there exists a small region where chiral symmetry is restored but the color degrees of freedom are still confined .",
    "this result should be checked in other effective models , e.g. in the framework of dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) .",

    "<S> we investigate the chiral condensate and the dressed polyakov loop or dual chiral condensate at finite temperature and density in two - flavor nambu  jona - lasinio model . </S>",
    "<S> the dressed polyakov loop is regarded as an equivalent order parameter of deconfinement phase transition in a confining theory . </S>",
    "<S> we find the behavior of dressed polyakov loop in absence of any confinement mechanism is quite interesting , with only quark degrees of freedom present , it still shows an order parameter like behavior . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that in the chiral limit , the critical temperature for chiral phase transition coincides with that of the dressed polyakov loop in the whole @xmath0 plane . in the case of explicit chiral symmetry breaking , it is found that the transition temperature for chiral restoration @xmath1 is smaller than that of the dressed polyakov loop @xmath2 in the low baryon density region where the transition is a crossover . with the increase of current quark mass the difference between the two transition temperatures </S>",
    "<S> is found to be increasing . </S>",
    "<S> however , the two critical temperatures coincide in the high baryon density region where the phase transition is of first order . </S>",
    "<S> we give an explanation on the feature of @xmath3 in the case of 1st and 2nd order phase transitions , and @xmath4 in the case of crossover , and expect this feature is general and can be extended to full qcd theory . </S>",
    "<S> our result might indicate that in the case of crossover , there exists a small region where chiral symmetry is restored but the color degrees of freedom are still confined .    `` </S>"
