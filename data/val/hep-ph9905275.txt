    "perhaps the most puzzling issue in the physics of elementary particles is the origin of the fermion mass hierarchy .",
    "the top quark mass is observed to be @xmath2 times larger than that of the electron , although both originate at the scale at which electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "other quark and lepton mass eigenvalues , as well as the off - diagonal elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix exhibit hierarchies that are no less mysterious . while many models have been proposed to explain the flavor structure of the standard model , a theory that is economical and compelling has yet to be found .",
    "the naturalness of small couplings , in this case the yukawa couplings of the light fermions , can be understood in a field - theoretic context if a symmetry of the lagrangian is restored when these couplings are set to zero .",
    "thus , one approach to the flavor problem is to propose new symmetries acting horizontally across standard model generations , that forbid all but the top quark yukawa coupling in the flavor symmetric limit . if the flavor symmetry group @xmath3 is spontaneously broken by a set of `` flavon '' fields @xmath4 , then light fermion masses arise generically via higher - dimension operators involving the @xmath4 fields , together with the matter and higgs fields of the standard model .",
    "these operators may have a renormalizable origin , as in the froggatt - nielsen mechanism  @xcite , or may simply be present at the planck scale .",
    "a hierarchy in the light fermion yukawa couplings may be explained if @xmath3 is broken sequentially through a series of smaller and smaller subgroups , at successively lower energy scales . in this paper",
    "we consider a model that explains the quark and lepton mass hierarchies in precisely this way .",
    "in addition , we work within the context of supersymmetry so that the hierarchy between the weak scale and the flavor physics scale @xmath5 is stable under radiative corrections",
    ".    one must now choose a type of symmetry , either global or gauged , for building a model of flavor .",
    "global symmetries are thought to be violated by quantum gravitational effects , and may not be consistent as fundamental symmetries of nature  @xcite .",
    "we therefore focus on gauge symmetries in this paper .",
    "a complication in supersymmetry is that continuous gauge symmetries lead to @xmath6-term interactions between the flavon fields and the scalar superpartners of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "these couplings lead to large off - diagonal squark masses , and unacceptable flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) effects  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , discrete gauge symmetries provide a viable alternative .",
    "a discrete gauge symmetry can arise , for instance , when a continuous gauge symmetry group is spontaneously broken to a discrete subgroup . in this case , the discrete charges of fields in the low - energy effective theory must satisfy constraints that follow from the anomaly freedom of the original gauge group  @xcite . more importantly , however , discrete gauge symmetries can be defined independently of any embedding  @xcite .",
    "for example , such symmetries might arise directly in string compactifications .",
    "we construct a model based on a discrete gauge symmetry satisfying the appropriate low - energy constraints , independent of the origin of the symmetry .",
    "in addition , we restrict our attention to non - abelian discrete gauge groups , since these groups can have two - dimensional irreducible representations . by placing the first two generations of quark",
    "superfields into a doublet , for example , we achieve exact degeneracy of the corresponding squarks in the flavor symmetry limit  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath3 is broken only by light fermion yukawa couplings , a high degree of degeneracy is preserved in the low - energy theory . in this way",
    ", one greatly suppresses the fcnc effects that one would expect otherwise if the superparticle spectrum were generic .    despite the expansive literature on models of flavor  @xcite ,",
    "relatively few successful supersymmetric models based on discrete non - abelian gauged flavor symmetries exist  @xcite .",
    "it seems that most models fall into two categories : ( a ) models with relatively large discrete groups containing so many subgroups that they can easily accommodate the observed fermion mass hierarchy via a sequential breaking of the symmetry , and ( b ) models based on smaller discrete symmetries that require fine tuning to compensate for the fact that the flavor symmetry is a bit too restrictive .",
    "the @xmath7 model  @xcite , for example , is interesting in that it is based on the smallest non - abelian group @xmath8 , and has a simple representation structure .",
    "however , the replication of @xmath8 factors yields a discrete group with @xmath9 elements and numerous subgroups , and so it is not surprising that one can find a breaking pattern that accommodates viable yukawa textures . on the other hand the @xmath10 model  @xcite",
    "has a smaller discrete group ( one with @xmath11 elements , when one takes into account that only a @xmath12 subgroup of the u(1 ) is relevant ) , but has quark mass textures that would not be viable without tuning of order one operator coefficients .",
    "our goal is to find a model that lives somewhere between the two extremes defined above , and believe that the model we present in this paper is a step in the right direction .",
    "we hope that it will lead to interest in finding an optimal theory of flavor based on a non - abelian discrete gauge group .",
    "our model is based on the group @xmath13 , where @xmath1 describes the symmetry of a regular hexagon under proper rotations in three dimensions . in sec .",
    "[ d6 ] , we discuss this symmetry group in more detail , and explain why it is promising for model building . the model itself is presented in sec .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "left- and right - handed matter fields transform under separate @xmath1 factors , and the three generations of a given field have a simple doublet - plus - singlet representation structure , with quarks and leptons distinguished by their transformation properties under a parity subgroup . in sec .",
    "[ phenom ] we consider bounds on the model from flavor - changing processes , and in the final section we summarize our conclusions .",
    "fundamental properties of the theory of discrete groups are summarized in appendix  [ grpthy ] , and details of combining @xmath1 representations appear in appendix  [ clebsch ] .",
    "in order to obtain the degree of degeneracy among the scalar superpartners necessary to suppress fcnc s at a phenomenologically acceptable level , we require that the light two generations of a given mssm matter field appear in at least a doublet . all abelian groups can be shown to possess only one - dimensional irreducible representations , and therefore the desired horizontal symmetry group @xmath3 must be non - abelian . although it is tempting to explain the three - family replication by placing all quarks in triplet representations of @xmath3 , it is also true that the top quark appears to be distinguished from the others by its large mass .",
    "indeed , the top quark is the only one in the standard electroweak theory with an @xmath14 yukawa coupling , suggesting that it may have different transformation properties than fields of the first two generations .",
    "thus , it is natural to assign the top quark to a ( possibly nontrivial ) one - dimensional representation of @xmath3 . if one works only with triplet quark representations as in ref .",
    "@xcite , one must explain with dynamics rather than symmetry why @xmath15 is so large .",
    "the smallest non - abelian group is @xmath8 , the group of permutations among three objects .",
    "it has 3 ! = 6 elements , and possesses one doublet and two singlet representations , thus satisfying eq .",
    "( [ repcount ] ) .",
    "@xmath8 is isomorphic to the dihedral group @xmath16 , which is the group of proper rotations in three dimensions that leave an equilateral triangle invariant . to picture this",
    "geometrically ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , let the triangle lie in the @xmath17-plane with its centroid at the origin , so that @xmath18 is the normal vector .",
    "then @xmath16 is generated by a rotation ( @xmath19 ) of @xmath20 radians about @xmath18 and a rotation ( @xmath21 ) of @xmath22 radians about @xmath23 that turns the triangle upside - down .",
    "note that @xmath24 , so that the group is non - abelian .",
    "the three irreducible representations in this picture are @xmath25 , the trivial singlet left invariant by all actions of the group ; @xmath26 , a singlet invariant under @xmath19 but odd under @xmath21 ( such as the vector @xmath18 ) ; and a doublet @xmath27 , one realization of which is the pair ( @xmath23 , @xmath28 ) .    the simplicity of this structure was used to great effect in the @xmath7 model  @xcite ; there , the three generations of left - handed quarks @xmath29 , the right - handed up - type quarks @xmath30 , and the right - handed down - type quarks @xmath6 were each assigned to @xmath31 representations of different @xmath8 factor groups , while remaining trivial ( transforming as @xmath25 ) under the others . the left - handed leptons @xmath32 and their right - handed partners @xmath33 were assigned to @xmath34 representations of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively . as one sees from the previous paragraph , the combination @xmath34 has the natural geometric interpretation of forming a complete vector in three - dimensional space , if one pictures @xmath16 embedded in the group o(3 ) of all rotations in three dimensions .",
    "this fact is useful in understanding anomaly cancellation conditions , as is discussed in section  [ model ] .",
    "the @xmath7 model successfully explains the light squark degeneracy and the unique largeness of @xmath15 , and also accommodates a phenomenologically viable texture of yukawa matrices through sequential spontaneous symmetry breaking in which flavons , transforming nontrivially under @xmath3 , obtain vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) .",
    "for example , the flavon vev that gives rise to the bottom yukawa coupling appears at a higher scale than the one that gives rise to that of the strange quark , explaining why @xmath37 .",
    "the threefold replication of @xmath8 factors is necessary to allow for a sufficient number of stages of symmetry breaking to accommodate all the distinct yukawa couplings . at each stage of symmetry",
    "breaking there remains some smaller set of symmetries still obeyed by the lagrangian of the theory , which is specified by some subgroup of the original group @xmath3 .",
    "because of its small size , a single @xmath8 factor is insufficient since @xmath8 contains few nontrivial subgroups and therefore allows few distinct stages of symmetry breaking . while it is clearly possible to choose arbitrarily large groups that are suitable for our purposes , such choices violate the desire for minimality in particle physics",
    "therefore , our goal is to find a group large enough to accommodate all the properties in which we are interested but small enough to be compelling for study as a potentially real symmetry of nature .",
    "we seek a model satisfying the following criteria :    * degeneracy of first two generations of squarks in the symmetry limit : a @xmath38 representation structure for the up - type quark superfields , and either a @xmath38 or @xmath39 for the down - type quark and lepton superfields ; * invariance of only the top quark yukawa coupling under @xmath3 ; * a simple pattern of anomaly cancellation ; * enough subgroups to accommodate a viable yukawa texture via sequential symmetry breaking ; * absence of unnatural fine tuning of parameters ; * as small a group as possible , with minimal replication of factor groups .    in order to maintain the attractive features of the group @xmath16 , we consider the 12-element dihedral group @xmath1 , which is the smallest group that nontrivially contains @xmath16 as a subgroup .",
    "@xmath1 is the symmetry group of a regular hexagon under proper rotations in three dimensions , and indeed , is isomorphic to @xmath40 , as may be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . by adjoining @xmath41 , the odd element of the @xmath42 group , which is a rotation by @xmath22 in the @xmath17-plane , one generates the complete @xmath1 : the sixfold rotation ( @xmath43 radians ) necessary for the hexagonal symmetry is @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath1 possesses four singlet and two doublet inequivalent irreducible representations . using the isomorphism @xmath45 ,",
    "these may be labeled * r*@xmath46 , where * r * is a representation of @xmath16 and @xmath47 is a parity indicating the action of @xmath41 on the elements of * r*. for example , the original representations of @xmath16 transforming like @xmath18 and ( @xmath48 ) are identified with the @xmath1 representations @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the other representations of @xmath1 are @xmath51 ( the trivial singlet ) , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "explicit matrix representations and the rules for combining them are relegated to appendix  [ clebsch ] .",
    "a real advantage of the dihedral groups @xmath55 is that , in each doublet representation , the rotation matrix @xmath21 in a particular basis ( corresponding geometrically to a rotation of @xmath22 radians about the @xmath56-axis ) has the form @xmath57 which means that the first component of the doublet in this basis is left invariant under the @xmath42 subgroup of @xmath55 generated by the twofold rotation @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , breaking @xmath58 permits a vev in the first component of the doublet while forbidding one in the second .",
    "this feature goes a long way toward building a hierarchical yukawa texture .",
    "there exists another 12-element group that generalizes @xmath16 , the `` dicyclic '' group @xmath59 .",
    "just as the full rotation group su(2 ) in quantum mechanics forms a double - covering of the classical rotation group o(3 ) , @xmath59 may be thought of as the quantum - mechanical generalization of @xmath16 : in either su(2 ) or @xmath59 , a @xmath60 rotation is not the identity operator for all representations , but rather there exist `` spinorial '' representations for which such a rotation produces a phase of @xmath61 . in particular ,",
    "one of the doublet representations of @xmath59 is spinorial .",
    "unfortunately , one can show that there is no basis in which only one of the components of this doublet receives a vev , leaving an unbroken subgroup .",
    "therefore , the group @xmath1 is more convenient than @xmath59 for building a viable yukawa texture .",
    "finally , we have found that including only two factors of @xmath1 is enough to satisfy all the listed criteria ; in particular , we have assigned @xmath29 and @xmath32 to transform nontrivially under a single @xmath1 , called @xmath62 to denote chirality , and @xmath30 , @xmath6 , and @xmath33 under a corresponding @xmath63 .",
    "with @xmath64 elements , @xmath65 is the smallest group yet discussed in the literature that satisfies our itemized criteria . while we can not rule out that some single , smaller discrete group might be found that works equally well in meeting our requirements , the simple , left - right symmetric form of the @xmath66 model presented in the next section is intriguing , and suggests that this and similar group structures may be worthy of further consideration .",
    "we propose the flavor symmetry group @xmath66 , where the three generations of matter fields transform as @xmath67-dimensional combinations of @xmath1 .",

    "note that the left - handed fields @xmath29 and @xmath32 transform nontrivially only under @xmath62 , while the right - handed fields @xmath30 , @xmath6 , and @xmath33 transform nontrivially only under @xmath63 .",
    "note also that quark and lepton fields are distinguished by their @xmath1 parity properties : quarks transform as @xmath69 , while leptons transform as @xmath70 .",
    "in contrast , the mssm higgs fields must transform under both @xmath1 symmetries : @xmath71 the differing parity assignments assure that the top quark yukawa coupling is invariant under the flavor symmetry , while that of the bottom quark is forbidden in the symmetry limit .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the assignment of , for example , @xmath32 and @xmath6 to different @xmath1 factors implies that this model can not be embedded easily into a unified field theory containing su(5 ) as a subgroup .",
    "however , our model is perfectly consistent with gauge unification in a string theoretic context , which some may argue is preferable , given the absence of the usual doublet - triplet and proton decay problems associated with the existence of color - triplet higgs fields .      to understand anomaly cancellation in this model",
    ", it is useful to study first a simpler example .",
    "consider a toy model based on the flavor symmetry @xmath72 .",
    "let us assign the three generations of matter fields to @xmath73 representations , and assign the two higgs fields of the mssm , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , both to @xmath26 s .",
    "we wish to show that @xmath8 is a consistent discrete gauge symmetry in this low - energy theory .",
    "to do so , imagine adding two additional higgs fields , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , which are doublets under @xmath8 .",
    "now one can embed all the fields into * 3 * -dimensional representations of o(3 ) , since a * 3 * decomposes into @xmath78 .",
    "it is clear in this case that the o(3)@xmath79su(2)@xmath80 and o(3)@xmath79su(3)@xmath80 anomalies vanish trivially , since the o(3 ) generators are antisymmetric , and hence traceless .",
    "it was demonstrated by banks and dine @xcite that the only anomaly cancellation conditions needed for the consistency of the low - energy effective theory are those derived by ibez and ross  @xcite that are linear in the embedding group ( in this case o(3 ) ) , and that involve only the non - abelian low - energy continuous gauge groups .",
    "furthermore , they point out that this is equivalent to the requirement that any effective interaction @xmath81 generated by instantons of these continuous gauge groups remains invariant under the action of the discrete group .",
    "since this latter criterion does not depend on any particular embedding of the discrete group into a continuous one at higher energies , it is the actual constraint we demand on the low - energy effective theory .",
    "since we have seen that the linear o(3 ) anomalies vanish , we conclude that @xmath8 is not anomalous in the extended version of the toy model .",
    "now notice that the higgs fields in the extended theory form a vector - like pair , so that one can give a large mass to the unwanted doublet components , thus decoupling them from the low - energy theory .",
    "( in the o(3 ) embedding , this can be accomplished by breaking o(3 ) through giving a large vev to only the linear combination of * 1*+*5 * coupling to the doublets . )",
    "since @xmath8 remains unbroken when integrating out the unwanted states , the set of operators generated from @xmath81 involving just the light fields , @xmath82 , also remains invariant under @xmath8 .",
    "thus , one concludes that desired low - energy theory is also free of discrete gauge anomalies .",
    "this is the basis of the @xmath8 charge assignments in the @xmath7 model described in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in our model",
    ", we maintain the multiplicity of * 2 * and @xmath26 representations described in the toy model above , for any given @xmath8 factor .",
    "however , the group @xmath1 is isomorphic to @xmath83 , and so one must also check that the @xmath42 factor is not anomalous . to do so , one can embed @xmath42 into a u(1 ) and check that the u(1 ) charges satisfy the linear ibez - ross condition for the @xmath84 anomaly@xcite : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the su(@xmath87 ) invariant defined by @xmath88 and @xmath89 is the u(1 ) charge of the @xmath90th field .",
    "for example , the right - handed quark fields might be embedded into @xmath91 , where we assign u(1 ) charges @xmath92 and @xmath93 to the @xmath27 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ eq : zanom ] ) tells us @xmath94 which is satisfied for @xmath95 .",
    "thus , the @xmath1 representation @xmath96 is anomaly free .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that eq .",
    "( [ eq : zanom ] ) is satisfied for su(2 ) and su(3 ) given the @xmath42 charge assignments presented in ( [ eq : matter ] ) and ( [ eq : higgs ] ) .",
    "note that the anomaly from the @xmath42 subgroup of @xmath62 cancels between the third - generation @xmath32 field and @xmath75 .      to derive the yukawa textures ,",

    "the largest parameters breaking the symmetry arise at @xmath144 , and give rise to @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 .",
    "in typical flavor models with @xmath148 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 appear at @xmath121 ; their slightly larger size in this model may easily be accommodated choosing @xmath149 or a smaller @xmath150 combined with some adjustment of the undetermined order unity coefficients .",
    "the next parameters of interest are @xmath151 , arising at @xmath121 and @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 at @xmath124 .",
    "these give rise to phenomenologically acceptable values for our choice of @xmath150 .",
    "note at this point that the yukawa matrices @xmath155 and @xmath156 , although arising from different flavon structures , have the same basic texture ; in order to accommodate the detailed differences between the down - type quark and lepton textures , one must choose coefficients such that @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "the entries giving rise to @xmath159 , @xmath160 or @xmath161 , appear at @xmath162 , and indeed give rise upon diagonalization to a cabibbo angle of @xmath163 , since the ( 12 ) entries are suppressed by one power of @xmath110 compared to the ( 22 ) entries .",
    "the couplings @xmath164 and @xmath165 appear at @xmath166 , and have appropriate magnitudes , taking into account the factor 1/3 previously mentioned . finally , @xmath167 arises only at third order in the flavon fields as described in the previous subsection , and appears ( as desired ) at @xmath141 .",
    "in the previous section , we showed that there is a three - step symmetry breaking pattern for @xmath66 that yields viable yukawa textures , given our choice of flavon fields .",
    "it remains to be addressed whether the scalar superpartner mass - squared matrices retain a sufficient degeneracy after the flavor symmetry group is broken to suppress supersymmetric fcnc effects adequately .",
    "we consider this question in the current section .",
    "first , note that scalar degeneracy is still approximate in the low energy theory , so one may treat off - diagonal scalar masses in an insertion approximation .",
    "this is clearly justified for scalars of the first two generations , where approximate degeneracy is predicted by the theory , and we make the mild assumption that the third generation scalar masses do not differ wildly from the first two .",
    "then , for any given scalar mass - squared matrix , let us define an average diagonal entry by @xmath168 , and parameterize the size of the off - diagonal elements by @xmath169 where @xmath170 and @xmath171 indicate chirality ( @xmath32 or @xmath172 ) , and the other indices run over generation space . note that we evaluate the @xmath173 in the basis where the quark and lepton mass matrices are diagonal .",
    "this parameterization is especially useful since the relevant experimental bounds on the @xmath173 have been compiled systematically by gabbiani _",
    "et al._@xcite , allowing one to put our model to the test . in tables  [ phone ] through [ phsix ] , we give a comparison between the predictions of our model and the experimental bounds .",
    "the predictions follow directly from @xmath110 power counting with @xmath174 , and do not take into account the undetermined order one coefficients .",
    "thus , the predictions of our model may in fact be significantly smaller .",
    "table  [ phone ] follows from @xmath175-@xmath176 , @xmath6-@xmath177 , and @xmath171-@xmath178 mixing constraints , table  [ phtwo ] from the decay @xmath179 , and table  [ phthree ] from the lepton flavor - violating decays @xmath180 .",
    "note that the left - right scalar mass terms are determined by a higgs vev , as well as the value of a dimensionful coefficient @xmath170 .",
    "the ratio of higgs vev s is determined by the value of the bottom quark yukawa coupling that is predicted in our model ; again , we take @xmath181 for our estimates .",
    "the @xmath170 parameter is of the same order as the supersymmetry - breaking scale , but need not be equal to the average scalar superpartner mass .",
    "we give our assumed values for @xmath170 and the relevant superparticle masses in the table captions .",
    "of course , taking larger values for the superparticle masses makes the constraints less severe .    to account for standard model cp violation",
    ", one must allow for the possibility of complex operator coefficients and flavon vev s .",
    "here one suffers from some ambiguity since the origins of cp violation are not specified in our theory .",
    "nevertheless , one may compare the constraints from cp - violating processes to the predictions of our model assuming the worst - case scenario in which order one phases appear in _ all _ entries of the scalar mass matrices .",
    "the corresponding results are given in tables  [ phfour ] through [ phsix ] .",
    "one learns from these tables that the flavor symmetry provides a significant suppression of cp - conserving and cp - violating flavor - changing processes , so that it is not necessary to take any soft supersymmetry - breaking mass larger than @xmath182  gev .",
    "it is reasonable to view this as a positive result , especially when taking into account the possible alternatives : for example , if the @xmath183 elements of all the @xmath168 matrices were of order the cabibbo angle @xmath110 , one would be forced to take the average squark mass above @xmath184  tev to evade the @xmath175-@xmath176 mixing constraints , and above @xmath185  tev to evade the bounds on @xmath186 , assuming order one phases .",
    "the @xmath66 symmetry is precisely what renders the model suitable for solving the hierarchy problem , by allowing a sufficiently low superparticle mass scale .",
    "in addition , we see that our results are compatible with the bounds from the flavor - conserving , cp - violating electric dipole moments .",
    "these bounds could be accommodated even in the worst - case scenario of ubiquitous order one phases , provided that @xmath170 terms are taken somewhat smaller than the average scalar masses .",
    "in addition , these tables give a clear indication of where the model is most likely to be tested experimentally .",
    "the bounds that are most marginally satisfied for light superparticle masses are those from @xmath187 and the various cp - violating observables .",
    "improved bounds on @xmath187 combined with the discovery of light sleptons would provide the clearest means of excluding the model .",
    "in addition , improved bounds on electric dipole moments , as well as a measurement of cp violation in the b system , might exclude the generic order one phase picture described above .",
    "depending on the precise bounds , the model may still be viable in such a circumstance if cp is spontaneously broken in only some of the flavon vev s , since the pattern of phases in the soft masses would then be far from generic . however , we do not consider that possibility further in this article .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the possibility of constructing a realistic theory of flavor based on a relatively small discrete gauge symmetry group .",
    "our @xmath188 model can explain the hierarchy of quark and lepton masses via a three - step sequential breaking pattern , and greatly alleviates the flavor - changing neutral current problem that is endemic to generic , softly - broken supersymmetric theories .",
    "in addition , the smallness of the flavor symmetry group prevents one from suppressing flavor - changing effects arbitrarily , so that the model remains falsifiable .",
    "in particular , improved bounds on @xmath189 could be used to exclude the model if light sleptons are eventually discovered .",
    "better measurements of electric dipole moments of the electron and neutron may demand modifying our assumption of a generic pattern of order one phases in operator coefficients and flavon vev s , which we argued could account for standard model cp violation , at least for some range of the soft supersymmetry - breaking masses and @xmath170 parameters . while in a small number of places we needed to assume some fluctuation in order one coefficients , for example to obtain the famous georgi - jarskog factors of @xmath190 in the charged lepton yukawa matrix",
    ", we do not view this as a serious shortcoming of the model .",
    "after all , we know of no low - energy effective theory in particle physics where symmetry considerations alone completely account for the particle phenomenology . from this point of view , our model works surprisingly well overall .",
    "finally , there are a number of possible issues in our model that may be worth additional investigation , such as spontaneous cp violation and extension of the model to the neutrino sector .",
    "however , it seems to us that the more interesting problem is to find the most compelling model based on a minimal discrete gauged flavor - symmetry group .",
    "while we believe we have made progress in the current work , the possibility of constructing the most convincing theory of this type remains an intriguing open question .",

    "a representation is _ irreducible _ if the corresponding matrices can not be simultaneously block - diagonalized , and two matrix representations are _ equivalent _ if they can be related by a change of basis .",
    "the most interesting feature of finite groups for our purposes is that the number of elements ( _ order _ ) @xmath192 of @xmath191 is related to the number and dimensions @xmath193 of its inequivalent irreducible representations @xmath194 , @xmath195 meaning that a given finite group has only a finite number of inequivalent irreducible representations , all of them finite - dimensional .",
