    "the star formation history of the universe ( @xmath2 ) constrains models of structure formation , the assembly of galaxies , metal production , and the epoch of reionization .",

    ". if these models are correct , then we should expect consistency between the models and observations of the rate at which galaxies formed stars throughout cosmic time at all galaxy mass scales .",
    "moreover , we should expect a similar level of consistency between the observed _ in situ _ star formation rate ( sfr ) and the stellar record and metal content of the universe at the present day .    with the combination of _ hst _ , large aperture redshifts surveys , and well - calibrated photometric redshifts ,",
    "there has been an explosion of observational constraints on the sfr at high redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , now pushing out to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these measurements have been augmented by measurements of the obscured sfr due to advances in the capabilities of long wavelength detectors allowing measurements of high-@xmath7 star formation @xcite .",
    "such assessment of the sfr has also been made at low redshifts by surveys like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss * ? ? ? * ) and the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex * ? ? ?",
    "* ) all on the basic properties of sfr versus time .    while early measurements of @xmath2 showed a peak around @xmath8 ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , more recent measurements have generally put the peak prior to @xmath9 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including measurements combining the star formation histories ( sfhs ) of local group galaxies . inside the lg @xcite found that @xmath2 was broadly consistent with redshift surveys with no significant contribution from dwarfs at any epoch , and @xcite found an excess of star formation in recent epochs , dominated by the disk of the milky way , as well as a recent increase in the contribution from dwarfs .",
    "@xcite found little difference in the sfhs of the lg dwarfs and those in a larger volume .",
    "only one recent measurement , based on integrated galaxy spectra in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , has found a peak more recent than @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , recent analytical calculations @xcite , semi - analytic galaxy formation models @xcite , and hydrodynamic simulations @xcite also generally put the peak earlier than @xmath9 . for current wmap cosmology",
    ", this places the peak at lookback times @xmath1110 gyr .",
    "there is mounting evidence that low - mass galaxies may have later formation times ( i.e.  down - sizing  * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and many others),which could in principle affect the location of the @xmath2 peak .",
    "unfortunately , direct constraints at high redshift are challenging , given that all _ in situ _ redshift - based studies have magnitude limits that prohibit the inclusion of low - mass galaxies in their measurements .",
    "herein , we report our measurement @xmath2 in our local volume using resolved stellar populations from a volume - limited sample of galaxy disks : the largest ever measured using resolved stellar populations analysis .",
    "our approach has the benefit that we simultaneously explore the past sfh and the present stellar record .",
    "moreover , we have complete , volume - limited sampling of the galaxy population down to very low masses , rather than the high - mass galaxies that dominate _ in situ _ high - redshift studies .",
    "the limitations of the approach are difficulty resolving stars in massive spheroids , so that we can only trace the sfh of disks and dwarf galaxies , and a relatively short distance over which stars can be resolved with _",
    "hst _ , so that we can not measure a truly representative volume of the universe .",
    "our results are generally consistent with those of recent redshift surveys , and we conclude that with the currently - possible depth of resolved stellar photometry over this volume , we can not resolve the age of the peak beyond placing it at @xmath12 .",
    "all of the data for this study were analyzed through the angst ( go-10915 ) and acs nearby galaxies : reduce , reuse , recycle ( angrrr ; ar-10945 ) programs .",
    "our full sample is detailed in table  [ table ] and in @xcite .",
    "the motivation for the sample selection was to stay within a limited volume .",
    "we have included all galaxies inside of @xmath03.5  mpc , but outside the lg ( as defined by * ? ? ? * @xmath08  mpc@xmath1 ) and more than 20@xmath13 from the galactic plane ( @xmath034% of the sphere ) .",
    "angst extended this distance limit to @xmath04  mpc in the direction of the m81 group and sculptor filament to improve sampling of massive galaxies and dense environments .",
    "the cen  a group , which is also within @xmath04  mpc , was excluded due to its low galactic latitude and incomplete galaxy census .",
    "our sample therefore covers only @xmath070% of the stellar mass in the volume between 3.5 and 4.0 mpc , making our effective distance limit @xmath03.8  mpc .",
    "therefore , our net volume surveyed is @xmath0140  mpc@xmath1 .",
    "this scale is smaller than the large scale structure of the universe , and thus we may be sampling a non - representative environment",
    ". therefore differences between our results and those of redshift surveys may be primarily due to such sampling effects .",
    "we exclude kdg73 and sc22 as their revised distance moduli place them beyond 4 mpc , and we exclude bk6n and kkh57 due to poor data quality .",
    "the program obtained acs and wfpc2 imaging of a volume - limited sample of galaxies .",
    "all photometry techniques are described in detail in @xcite and k. gilbert et al.(in preparation ) . in short ,",
    "the photometry and artificial star tests were measured simultaneously for all of the objects in the uncombined images using the software packages hstphot and dolphot @xcite , and the output data were culled on signal - to - noise , sharpness , and crowding .",
    "we measured the sfr and metallicity as a function of stellar age using the software package match @xcite .",
    "we fit the observed cmds ( with magnitude cuts set to limits provided in table  1 ) by populating the stellar evolution models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* with updates in @xcite ) with a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "we fixed the distance and reddening to the @xcite values .",
    "the best fit provides the relative contribution of stars of each age and metallicity in each field .",
    "we then performed monte carlo fits by resampling the best - fitting model 100 times .",
    "then , when fitting the realizations , the systematic errors are accounted for by introducing small random shifts in the bolometric magnitudes and effective temperatures of the models .",
    "these shifts are introduced at the level of the differences between models in the literature , and therefore serve as a proxy of the effects of our choice of stellar evolution models . from these tests we calculated our uncertainties due to poisson sampling , errors in photometry , and systematic errors due to deficiencies in the stellar evolution models as well as any offset in distance , reddening , and/or zero - points .",
    "our time bins were chosen based on the features present in most of our data .",
    "in general , the main - sequence and blue he - burning sequences provide high resolution time sensitivity for times more recent than @xmath0400  myr , after this epoch , our photometry contains only the rgb , which contains degeneracies between age and metallicity @xcite , and the agb , which is generally poorly populated and suffers from poorly - constrained models @xcite , and the red clump , which is dominated by old ( @xmath52 gyr ) stars .",
    "we therefore limited ourselves to 4 bins in this large interval : one long bin on each side of @xmath01  gyr ago ( the epoch where our cmds provide the least information ) in order to leverage more reliable age information from before and after this period , and two more bins where we have additional information from the red clump to help constrain the age distribution ( 410 gyr and 1014 gyr ) .",
    "when determining the sfhs , we check the effects of our varying depth and magnitude cuts for fitting each cmd . due to the failure of acs during the angst program ,",
    "our photometry sample is heterogeneous and of varying depth ( see electronic table  1 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the bulk of the stellar mass is in m81 and ngc253 , which were both observed with acs , and every attempt was made to obtain a depth reaching the red clump feature in the cmd with wfpc2 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "furthermore , our sfhs for ancient times ( @xmath112  gyr ) were always taken from the deepest data available , which for most low - mass galaxies , included information from the red clump feature ( see electronic table  1 and figure  [ hist ] ) .",
    "there is still no guarantee that our data were all detailed enough to reliably separate populations with ages slightly less than 10  gyr from those with ages slightly greater than 10  gyr .",
    "our fields cover only a portion of each galaxy , making it necessary to scale the measured sfh to the total galaxy mass .",
    "once we had measured the sfhs for the deepest available field in each angst galaxy , we renormalized the sfrs to a @xcite imf ( divided by 2 ) , and we scaled them to the total stellar mass in each galaxy .",
    "we first estimated the galaxy s total stellar mass from _",
    "photometry ( see below ) . the stellar mass contained in our angst field",
    "was then calculated directly from our sfh .",
    "the quotient of these provided our estimate of the fraction of the galaxy s stellar mass contained in our field ( @xmath15 ) .    to estimate each galaxy s total stellar mass",
    ", we used the total spitzer 3.6@xmath16 m luminosity from the _ spitzer _ local volume legacy survey @xcite .",
    "to determine the appropriate @xmath17 to apply , we calculated @xmath17 using stellar masses determined by our cmd fits and spitzer 3.6@xmath16 photometry of the fields with good spitzer coverage and minimal foreground contamination . in all cases with reliable spitzer data covering our field , @xmath180.5@xmath190.2 .",
    "we therefore assumed @xmath17=0.5 to estimate each galaxy s total stellar mass .",
    "we verified that this assumption resulted in a total stellar masses of m81 and ngc  253 less than the mass calculated from their rotation curves ( as taken from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for large spirals ,",
    "the total stellar mass was further scaled by the galaxy s disk/(bulge+disk ) luminosity ratio from the literature to avoid representing stellar mass in the bulge with the sfh of the disk .",
    "for the largest angst galaxies , most of the young ( @xmath202  gyr ) populations are not well - mixed and are not contained within a single angst field .",
    "thus our assumption that the sfh in the deepest field ( which is located in the outer regions of the disk , where crowding is minimized ) is representative of the entire galaxy is not valid at recent timescales that do not allow sufficient radial mixing . in these cases , we therefore made use of shallower tilings that covered at least half of the optical disk . where possible ( m81 , ngc  253 , ngc  55 , and ngc  3109 ) , we measured the recent sfhs ( @xmath202 gyr ; @xmath210.2 ) from the shallower galaxy tilings .",
    "these tilings cover the full extent of the optical disk of m81 and half of the optical disk of the other 3 galaxies ( stepping along the major axis from the center ) .",
    "this method provides a more realistic total recent sfh for these large disk galaxies , requiring less scaling .",
    "the case of m81 required no scaling , and the other 3 galaxies required scaling only by a factor of 2 to account for the angst coverage . however , since a significant amount of star formation may be in unresolved clusters of stars and extincted by dust , we still likely miss some fraction of the most recent star formation .",
    "we verified that the recent sfrs obtained by this method were at least equal to the rates that would have come out of scaling the sfh of the deep field by the total _",
    "stellar mass of the galaxy in order to be sure that using the shallow tiled data was , at the very least , not reducing the amount recent star formation contained in these galaxies .",
    "we note our measuring technique is not sensitive to the stellar populations in bulges . because of severe crowding in the central portions of the large galaxies , the photometry was too shallow to produce reliable sfhs , and was therefore not included .",
    "the galaxy most strongly under - represented due to this bias against bulges is m82 , which is known to have a total current sfr @xmath016  m@xmath22  yr@xmath23 @xcite , mainly in the central 500  pc of the galaxy . on the other hand",
    ", the disk has a recent ( @xmath2040  myr ) sfr in our measurement of just 0.2@xmath190.1  m@xmath22  yr@xmath23 .",
    "our measured rate is similar whether we scale the sfr as determined from our deepest data or sum the recent sfrs from the available tilings .",
    "the star formation is mainly in the bulge , which dominates the galaxy luminosity ( @xmath24 * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason , @xmath25 for our most recent time bin is likely only a lower limit . in ngc  253 , where the star formation is more widespread throughout the disk , and",
    "the disk dominates the light ( @xmath26 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our technique recovered the recent sf better .",
    "the current rate is @xmath00.7  m@xmath22  yr@xmath23 @xcite , and we measure 0.4@xmath190.05  m@xmath22  yr@xmath23 ( 2080  myr ) .",
    "this value increases to 0.8@xmath190.1  m@xmath22  yr@xmath23 when renormalized to a salpeter imf .    when combining these final sfhs for the sample volume , we added uncertainties in quadrature and increased the total uncertainty by a factor of @xmath27 to approximately account for additional uncertainty from scaling and combining sfhs .",
    "we also derived total sfrs excluding m81 or ngc  253 to assess the sensitivity of our total to these massive galaxies .",
    "while this test removed a significant fraction of the total stellar mass , the sfh remained essentially unchanged in shape .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ components ] , m82 is disproportionately responsible for the high sfr @xmath014  gyr ago .",
    "our volume - limited @xmath2 , along with the contributions of some major components ( spirals , dwarfs , m81 , and ngc253 ) , is shown in figures  [ components ] and [ frac ] .",
    "overall , @xmath2 in the local volume is clearly dominated by that of the large spirals ngc  253 and m81 . in figure",
    "[ literature ] , we plot @xmath2 , scaled to match the cosmic mean stellar density , along with a compilation of literature studies @xcite , the lg @xcite , and two theoretical results @xcite . the models are not easily compared to our results because most of our time resolution comes at epochs more recent than @xmath28 whereas the models typically provide one data point per unit redshift .",
    "however , overall it is encouraging that our results are similar to the observational results already in the literature , determined using other techniques , that our results are similar to the sfh of the lg , and that our results fall within the wide range of theoretical calculations .",
    "we note that our result differs from those of @xcite , which analyzed spectra of @xmath010@xmath29 nearby galaxies and found the local @xmath2 peak at @xmath30 .",
    "while both measurements show enhanced star formation at lookback times of @xmath026 gyr , the discrepancy is in the @xmath31 ( @xmath1110  gyr ) bin , where our measured rate is a factor of 3 larger than theirs , placing our peak rate in this oldest bin .",
    "their sample and technique remain the only ones to have measured such a low rate for @xmath31 .    despite the diversity of sfhs in local dwarf galaxies ( @xmath32",
    "* ) , when one sums their total @xmath2 , it is remarkably similar to that of the full galaxy sample prior to @xmath33 ( @xmath111 gyr lookback time ) . for all but this recent epoch ,",
    "the @xmath2 pattern for the dwarfs is indistinguishable from that of the large spirals , which , in turn , is indistinguishable from that of the sample volume .",
    "therefore , we do not detect any significant difference between the formation times of dwarf galaxies and large spirals , suggesting that any differences occurred prior to @xmath3 ( @xmath1110 gyr ago ) .    at lookback times @xmath54 gyr ( @xmath34 ) ,",
    "our total sfrs are indistinguishable from those of most redshift surveys . however , our recent sfrs are higher than those of redshift surveys , similar to those of the lg @xcite .",
    "this result is largly due to our inclusion of low - mass galaxies ( other spirals and dwarfs in figures  [ components ] and [ frac ] ) , which contribute 50% of the sfr at recent times . such low - mass galaxies are typically not included in redshift surveys due to their low luminosities .",
    "we have derived @xmath2 for galaxy disks in our local volume using resolved stellar photometry .",
    "this measurement includes the contribution by different galaxy types .",
    "our sample is dominated , in number , by galaxies fainter than the limits of any available redshift survey or high-@xmath7 _ hst _ imaging .",
    "thus , our @xmath2 represents a portion of parameter space not yet studied in detail outside the lg .",
    "however , our sample is lacking in massive spheroids , whose mean @xmath2 is more reliably determined from the large samples included in redshift surveys and high-@xmath7 _ hst _ imaging .",
    "we find that , while @xmath2 is dominated by that of the spirals , the overall shape of the measurement is robust against removal of any single galaxy .",
    "we also find that the combined @xmath2 of the dwarf galaxies is not significantly different in shape from that of the larger spirals except for the most recent gyr , suggesting that @xmath050% of the stellar mass in both types of systems formed prior to @xmath9 .",
    "this result is consistent with those of @xcite for high - density environments .",
    "we have compared our measurements to those obtained by galaxy surveys and analysis of the hdf and udf .",
    "we find overall agreement between our results and those of galaxy surveys ; however , our measurements do not yet have the time resolution at epochs prior to 10  gyr ( @xmath35 ) to resolve the peak in cosmic sfr density .",
    "our measurements suggest that this peak lies prior to @xmath3 , consistent with the most recent _ hst / wfc3 _ results , which place the peak at @xmath36 @xcite . finally ,",
    "at recent times , the contribution of low - mass galaxies to the total sfr has increased , resulting in a higher total rate at recent times than observed by other methods .",
