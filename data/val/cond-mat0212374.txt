    "quantum computation has been shown to perform certain tasks much faster than classical computers @xcite .",
    "presently , very mature physical realizations of this idea originate in atomic physics , optics , and nuclear magnetic resonance .",
    "these systems are phase coherent in abundance , however , scaling up the existing few - qubits systems is not straightforward .",
    "solid state quantum computers have the potential advantage of being arbitrarily scalable to large systems of many qubits @xcite .",
    "their most important drawback is the coupling to the many degrees of freedom of a solid state system .",
    "even though recently there has been fast progress in improving the decoherence properties of experimentally realized solid state quantum bits @xcite , this remains a formidable task .",
    "quite a lot is known about decoherence properties of single solid state qubits , see e.g.  [ ] , but much less is known about systems of two or more coupled qubits @xcite .",
    "however , only for systems of at least two qubits , the central issue of entanglement can be studied .",
    "the physically available types of qubit coupling can be classified as heisenberg - type exchange which is typical for real spin-1/2-systems , and ising - type coupling , which is characteristic for _ pseudospin _ setups , where the computational degrees of freedom are not real spins . in the latter",
    ", the different spin components typically correspond to distinct variables , such as charge and flux @xcite whose couplings can and have to be engineered on completely different footing .",
    "previous work @xcite presented the properties of a system of two coupled solid state qubits which are coupled via @xmath3 type coupling as proposed in @xcite as the current - current coupling of superconducting charge quantum bits .    on the other hand , many systems such as inductively coupled flux qubits @xcite , capacitively coupled charge qubits @xcite and other pseudo - spin systems @xcite are described by a @xmath4 ising - type coupling .",
    "this indicates that the computational basis states are coupled , which i.e.  in the case of flux qubits are magnetic fluxes , whereas @xmath5 are electric charges .",
    "the @xmath1-observable is a natural way of coupling , because it is typically easy to couple to .",
    "we will study a two qubit - system coupled this way that is exposed to gaussian noise coupling to @xmath1 , the `` natural '' observable .",
    "this e.g.  accounts for the crucial effect of electromagnetic noise in superconducting qubits .",
    "we will compare both the case of noise that affects both qubits in a correlated way and the case of uncorrelated single - qubit errors .",
    "we determine the decoherence properties of the system by application of the well known bloch - redfield formalism and determine quality factors of a cnot gate for both types of errors and feasible parameters of the system .",
    "we model the hamiltonian of a system of two qubits , coupled via ising - type coupling .",
    "each of the two qubits is a two - state system that is described in pseudo - spin notation by the single - qubit hamiltonian @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy bias and @xmath8 the tunnel matrix element .",
    "the coupling between the qubits is determined by an extra term in the hamiltonian @xmath9 that represents e.g.  inductive interaction ( directly or via flux transformer ) in the case of flux qubits @xcite .",
    "thus , the complete two - qubit hamiltonian in the absence of a dissipative environment reads @xmath10 the dissipative ( bosonic ) environment is conveniently modeled as either a common bath or two distinct baths of harmonic oscillators , coupling to the @xmath1 components of the two qubits .",
    "this approach universally models baths which produce _ gaussian _ fluctuations , such as the noise from linear electrical circuits .",
    "an example for a situation described by a common bath is long correlation length electromagnetic noise from the experimental environment or noise generated or picked up by coupling elements such as flux transformers @xcite . short correlation length radiation or local readout and control electronics coupling to individual qubits @xcite might be described as coupling to two uncorrelated baths of harmonic oscillators .",
    "one should note that if the number of qubits is increased to more than two , there might also occur dissipative effects which neither affect all qubits nor only a single qubit but rather a cluster of qubits thus enhancing the complexity of our considerations @xcite .",
    "in the case of two uncorrelated baths , the full hamiltonian reads @xmath11 where each qubit couples to its own , distinct , harmonic oscillator bath @xmath12 , @xmath13 , via the coupling term @xmath14 , @xmath13 , that bilinearly couples a qubit to the collective bath coordinate @xmath15 .",
    "we again sum over the two qubits . in the case of two qubits coupling to one common bath , we model our two qubit system with the hamiltonian @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes one common bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the appropriate starting point for our further analysis is the singlet / triplet basis , consisting of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in the case of flux qubits ,",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 states correspond to clockwise and counterclockwise current respectively .    in this basis",
    ", the undamped hamiltonian @xmath24 , equation ( [ hop2qb_nobath ] ) , of the two qubit system assumes the matrix form @xmath25 with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . from now on ,",
    "we concentrate on the case of equal parameter settings , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "if we now also express the coupling to the dissipative environment in this basis , we find in the case coupling to two uncorrelated distinct baths that @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 . here",
    "the bath mediates transitions between the singlet and triplet states , the singlet is not a protected subspace .",
    "in the case of two qubits with equal parameters that are coupled to one common bath we obtain the matrix @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "one directly recognizes that compared to ( [ hop_matrix_2baths ] ) in this case thermalization to the singlet state is impeded , because ( [ hop_matrix_2 ] ) is block - diagonal in the singlet and triplet subspaces .",
    "the singlet and triplet are completely decoupled from each other and in the case of one common bath the singlet is also completely decoupled from the bath and thus protected from dissipative effects .",
    "therefore , a system in contact with one common bath that is prepared in the singlet state will never experience any decoherence effects .",
    "the singlet state is a protected subspace ( dfs ) @xcite , although a trivial , one - dimensional one .",
    "we calculate exact analytical eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the unperturbed two - qubit system hamiltonian in the aforementioned symmetric case of ( [ h_2qb ] ) , which reads @xmath38 this hamiltonian is block - diagonal and the largest block , the triplet , is three - dimensional , i.e.  it can be diagonalized using cardano s formula .",
    "details of that calculation are given in ref .. the case of non - identical qubits is more easily handled numerically .    in the following ,",

    "from the temperature dependence of the decoherence rates ( figure [ fig_temp_dependence_1 ] ) , we conclude that both types of environments show a similar behaviour ; however , in the case of one common bath , two of the decoherence rates are zero , and the remaining ones are slightly larger than in the case of two distinct baths . this temperature dependence is also reflected in the characteristics of the gate quality factors from quantum information theory , which are introduced as robust measures of the quality of a quantum logic operation .",
    "we illustrate that the gate quality factors depend linearly on @xmath103 , as expected .",
    "the time resolved uxor operation ( figures [ time_resolved_xor_downdown ] and [ time_resolved_xor_upup ] ) again illustrates the difference between one common and two distinct baths , and moreover we observe that single - qubit decoherence effects @xmath255 during the uxor operation are weak .",
    "the time scales of the dynamics of the coupled two qubit system are comparable to the time scales , which were already observed in experiments and discussed in the literature @xcite .    the question , whether one common bath or two distinct baths are less destructive regarding quantum coherence can not be clearly answered . for low enough temperatures , coupling to one common bath yields better results . however , when the temperature is increased two distinct baths do better ; in both temperature regimes , though , the gate quantifiers are only slightly different for both cases .",
    "compared to the work of thorwart @xcite , the interaction part of our model hamiltonian possesses symmetries ( the hamiltonian of the two - qubit operation and the errors commute ) that lead to better gate quality factors .",
    "furthermore , analysis of the symmetries and error sources of our model system can lead to improved coupling schemes for solid state qubits .",
    "milburn and co - workers on the other hand focused on comparison of classical and quantum mechanical dynamics @xcite and estimated the decoherence properties of two coupled two - state systems .",
    "governale @xcite determined the decoherence properties of two coupled charge qubits whose hamiltonian differs from ( [ hop2qb_nobath ] ) by the type of inter - qubit coupling , namely @xmath281 coupling .",
    "however , introducing the quality factors gives a measure to judge how certain qubit designs perform quantum gate operations .    as a next step",
    ", one should consider driving , to be able to observe and discuss rabi oscillations in systems of two coupled qubits .",
    "it should be investigated , how the decoherence properties are modified , if one adds more qubits to the system .",
