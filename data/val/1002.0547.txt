    "_ superseparability _ may be defined as the polar opposite of entanglement : two identical charged bosons , with state vectors that have considerable spatio - temporal overlap , are unable to feel each other s presence because the state vectors lie in disjoint hilbert spaces and can not be superposed .",
    "mathematically , this possibility appears to be contained in von neumann s hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics , but whether or not it is realized in nature can only be ascertained by experiment .",
    "this note describes the principle of a possible experiment based on the magnetic aharonov - bohm effect .    the mathematical phenomena that suggest the experiment are subtleties hidden in the notion of self - adjointness for unbounded operators .",
    "experience shows that these subtleties can generally be disregarded in practical applications of quantum mechanics ; among physicists , only the mathematically minded are likely to be familiar with them .",
    "for this reason , a brief review of the basic definitions and results , due mostly to von neumann , is provided in section  [ sec - self - adj ] .",
    "it follows an essential review of the historical background in section  [ sec - hist ] .",
    "the paper begins with a description of the experimental scheme in section  [ sec - scheme ] ; the theory of the experiment is given , after the historical and mathematical excursions , in section  [ sec - reeh ] .",
    "if the experiment turns out to be feasible , its results  be they positive or negative  will be consequential , and implications of the possible results are discussed briefly , in a non - speculative manner , in section  [ sec - discuss ] .",
    "the purpose of the experiment is to determine whether or not two beams of identical bosons , prepared in inequivalent representations of the ccr , can interfere with each other . a possible scheme for such an experiment is shown in figure  1 .",
    "a coherent beam of charged bosons ( e.g. , @xmath2-particles or deuterons ) from a source @xmath3 is split into two by a beam - splitter @xmath4 .",
    "one beam goes through the chamber @xmath5 , the other through the chamber @xmath6 .",
    "neither chamber contains a magnetic field , and the two are electromagnetically isolated from each other .",
    "they contain the magnetic flux lines @xmath7 respectively ( perpendicular to the plane of the paper ) ; at least one of these fluxes is continuously variable over a certain range .",
    "the experiment consists of observing changes in the interference pattern at the detector @xmath8 as @xmath9 is varied .",

    "( we use units in which @xmath14 for non - integral values of @xmath15 , the two beams will belong to disjoint hilbert spaces and should not  if the phrase _ disjoint hilbert spaces _ has physical meaning  be able to interfere with each other . for this reason , the scheme of the figure",
    "is called a _",
    "noninterferometer_. it is also possible that the above interpretation of quantum mechanics is invalid , and that both beams belong to the same hilbert space . in that case",
    "the interference pattern should merely shift , as @xmath15 is varied , returning to the original state when @xmath15 has changed exactly by unity ; the fringe shift should be periodic , with period @xmath16 .",
    "if the experiment is realizable , the case @xmath17 will correspond to the standard aharonov - bohm effect , so that this effect may be used to test the electromagnetic isolation of the chambers @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the reader is referred to the monograph by peshkin and tonomura @xcite for a historical account of the aharonov - bohm effect , and to the review article @xcite and monograph @xcite for the decisive experiments .",
    "it should be recalled that if a flux @xmath0 is quantized , then @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is an integer , so that @xmath20 for deuterons and @xmath21 for @xmath2-particles .",
    "therefore superseparability will never be observed with @xmath2-particles if both fluxes are quantized .",
    "we shall end this section with a few reservations and a remark .",
    "the configuration described above is an ideal which may be hard to realize in the laboratory ; that is why we have called it the ` scheme ' of an experiment .",
    "it is unlikely that the chambers @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be perfectly isolated from each other .",
    "it may not be possible to prepare a state with a sharp value of @xmath2 if the flux is not quantized .",
    "finally , the theory of section  [ sec - reeh ] would be applicable only if the interiors of chambers @xmath5 and @xmath6 are , for purposes of the experiment , reasonable approximations to the punctured plane .",
    "on the other hand , we know ",
    "if only by hindsight  that the aharonov - bohm effect can be observed under conditions that are less than ideal .",
    "therefore the possibility that superseparability may also be testable under less than ideal conditions should not be ruled out of hand .",
    "we begin by recalling two basic facts .",
    "( i ) the born - jordan commutation relation @xmath22 = -{\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\!i$ ] can not be represented by finite - dimensional matrices if @xmath23 is required to be the identity matrix .",
    "( ii ) if it is represented on an infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath24 with @xmath23 as the identity operator , then at least one of @xmath25 and @xmath11 must be represented by an unbounded operator ( see , for example , @xcite .",
    "unbounded operators are not defined everywhere on a hilbert space , and are discontinuous wherever they are defined .",
    "they give rise to mathematical phenomena that are not encountered in the theory of finite dimensional matrices , and it requires considerable effort to invest with meaning even the simplest of assertions , such as @xmath26=0 $ ] , if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are unbounded .",
    "the basic structures of quantum mechanics , namely matrix mechanics , wave mechanics and transformation theory were laid down in 192527 , but unbounded operators began to be explored only in 19291930 @xcite . the ` first quantum revolution ' ( this term is due to aspect @xcite )",
    "was completed while unbounded operators were still terra incognita even to mathematicians .",
    "in retrospect , one is struck by the fact that transformation theory could be developed with scant understanding of the operators that were to be transformed . by what magic was this achieved ?",
    "the answer lies in an ansatz due to hermann weyl and a theorem proven by von neumann .    in 1928",
    ", weyl published his book _ gruppentheorie und quantenmechanik _ @xcite . in this book",
    "he replaced the canonical commutation relations ( ccr ) for @xmath27 degrees of freedom by a @xmath28-parameter lie group , which had the ccr as its lie algebra .",
    "this group has become known as the _ weyl group _ , and we shall denote it by @xmath29 . we shall give the argument for @xmath30 ; the general case merely requires a cumbersome modification of the notation ( see @xcite , pp .",
    "272276 ) .",
    "let @xmath31 and define , formally , @xmath32 from the properties of the exponential function , it follows that @xmath33 write @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "formal computation yields the result @xmath37 by definition , the weyl group @xmath38 consists of the set of elements ( [ weyl - group-1 ] ) , with multiplication defined by ( [ weyl - group-2 ] ) and ( [ weyl - group-3 ] ) .",
    "the element @xmath39 is the identity of the group .",
    "the group @xmath38 is nonabelian and noncompact , with @xmath40 as the group manifold , and is a lie group .",
    "the same is true of the weyl group @xmath29 for @xmath27 degrees of freedom , except that its group manifold is @xmath41 .",
    "being noncompact , the weyl groups have no finite dimensional unitary representations . in a unitary representation , the elements @xmath42 and @xmath43 of @xmath38 are represented by unitary operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 on the hilbert space @xmath24 , and similar statements hold for @xmath29 . a result known as stone s theorem asserts that a one - parameter group of unitaries @xmath46 on a hilbert space has an infinitesimal generator @xmath47 : @xmath48 , where @xmath47 is self - adjoint .",
    "it is bounded if @xmath46 is compact ( @xmath49 , the circle ) and unbounded if @xmath46 is not compact ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "a representation of @xmath29 defines , uniquely , a representation of its lie algebra  the ccr  by self - adjoint operators . in the representation",
    "so defined , at least one member of any canonical pair @xmath51 is represented by an unbounded operator .. the exponential @xmath52 of the unbounded self - adjoint operator @xmath5 needs definition , but we shall content ourselves with the statement that it turns out to have the expected properties . ]    in 1930 von neumann proved that , for finite @xmath27 , the weyl group @xmath29 has only one irreducible unitary representation @xcite .",
    "he gave the name _ schrdinger operators _ to the representatives of the canonical variables @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and titled his paper ` die eindeutigkeit schrdingersche operatoren ' . his result has become known as ` von neumann s uniqueness theorem ' .",
    "if the ccr were equivalent to the weyl group , it would explain why quantum mechanics could be developed ahead of the theory of unbounded operators without falling into gross error .",
    "a lie group defines a unique lie algebra , but the converse is not true .",
    "the simplest examples are the covering groups of compact non - simply - connected lie groups",
    ". examples of this phenomenon that are relevant to elementary particle physics were unearthed by michel as early as 1962 @xcite .",
    "the canonical commutation relations are _ not _ abstractly equivalent to the weyl group ; as we shall see below , the @xmath55 will not even generate a lie group unless they are represented by self - adjoint operators .",
    "however , the requirement of self - adjointness can not be met in some simple and realizable physical situations .",
    "let @xmath24 be a hilbert space and @xmath5 an operator on it .",
    "if there exists a positive number @xmath56 such that @xmath57 for all @xmath58 , then @xmath5 is said to be _",
    "bounded_. if no such @xmath56 exists , then @xmath5 is said to be _",
    "unbounded_. an unbounded operator @xmath5 is not defined everywhere on @xmath24 ; the subset @xmath59 on which it is defined is called the _ domain _ of @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath60 is not dense in @xmath24 then @xmath5 is not ( yet ) mathematically manageable , and one generally assumes that @xmath5 is _ densely defined _",
    ", i.e. , @xmath60 is dense in @xmath24 .    in the rest of this section we shall deal only with unbounded operators , and",
    "therefore the adjective ` unbounded ' will be omitted .",
    "an operator @xmath5 is called _ closed _ if the set of ordered pairs @xmath61 is a closed subset of @xmath62 .",
    "an operator @xmath63 is an _ extension _ of @xmath5 if @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 ; one writes @xmath67 .",
    "an operator is called _ closable _ if it has a closed extension . every closable operator",
    "@xmath5 has a smallest closed extension , which is denoted by @xmath68 .    in matrix theory ,",
    "the adjoint is defined by @xmath69 . in operator theory",
    ", one has to take domains into consideration .",
    "let @xmath70 such that @xmath71 for all @xmath66 , and define @xmath72 by @xmath73 .",
    "then @xmath74 is precisely the set of these @xmath75 .",
    "one can show that if @xmath5 is densely defined , then @xmath72 is closed .",
    "furthermore , @xmath72 is densely defined if and only if @xmath5 is closable , and if it is , then @xmath76 .    if @xmath77 and @xmath78 for all @xmath79 , then @xmath5 is called _",
    "symmetric_. if @xmath80 and @xmath81 for all @xmath82 , then @xmath5 is called _ self - adjoint_. self - adjoint operators form a subclass of symmetric operators .",
    "a symmetric operator may have no self - adjoint extension , it may have many self - adjoint extensions , or it may have only one . in the last case ,",
    "it is called _ essentially self - adjoint_. one can show that if @xmath5 is essentially self - adjoint , then its closure @xmath68 is self - adjoint , i.e. , @xmath68 is the unique self - adjoint extension of @xmath5 .",
    "the fundamental differences between symmetric and self - adjoint operators are :    1 .",
    "the spectrum of a self - adjoint operator is a subset of the real line , whereas the spectrum of a symmetric operator is a subset of the complex plane ; a symmetric operator is self - adjoint if and only if its spectrum is a subset of the real line . 2 .",
    "a self - adjoint operator can be exponentiated , i.e. , if @xmath5 is self - adjoint then @xmath83 is defined for all @xmath84 ; a symmetric operator which is not self - adjoint _ can not _ be exponentiated .",
    "the representation problem for the ccr ( one degree of freedom ) may now be formulated as follows : _ find all pairs of essentially self - adjoint operators @xmath85 , densely defined on a common domain @xmath86 , such that @xmath87\\varphi = -{\\mathrm{i}}\\varphi$ ] for every @xmath88_. there are infinitely many such ( inequivalent ) pairs ; the interested reader is referred to schmudgen @xcite for details , and for references to earlier works .",
    "if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are self - adjoint , are defined on a common dense domain @xmath89 and commute on @xmath89 , then @xmath90 and @xmath91 are defined for all @xmath92 and commute . however ,",
    "if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are merely essentially self - adjoint , are defined on @xmath89 and commute on @xmath89 , then @xmath93 and @xmath94 _ do not necessarily commute_. this fact , which at first seems highly counterintuitive , was unearthed by nelson in 1958 ; for details and references , see reed and simon @xcite .",
    "we shall conclude this section with an example .",
    "the group of isometries of @xmath40 consists of translations and rotations .",
    "the group of isometries of the punctured plane @xmath95 is the group of rotations about the origin @xmath96 .",
    "what happens to the translation operators on @xmath40 , namely @xmath97 and @xmath98 , @xmath99 ( where @xmath100 ) , when the origin is excised ?",
    "the operators @xmath101 are defined on sets of differentiable functions . a function which is differentiable on @xmath40 is necessarily differentiable on @xmath95 , but the latter has a richer supply of differentiable functions than @xmath40 , e.g.",
    ", the function @xmath102 ( which is also square - integrable ) . restricting the domain enlarges the set of differentiable functions on which @xmath103 and @xmath104 are defined .",
    "this enlargement changes the _ spectra _ of these operators , which in turn leads to the failure of self - adjointness and exponentiability .",
    "in 1988 , helmut reeh showed that that the ` nelson phenomenon ' could be found in the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite . for brevity ,",
    "let us call a spinless particle of charge @xmath11 moving in a plane perpendicular to a trapped magnetic flux ",
    "the classical aharonov - bohm example  an _ ab - particle_. owing to cylindrical symmetry , the motion of an ab - particle is essentially two - dimensional .",
    "its canonical operators may be written , formally , as    @xmath105    boldface symbols denote 2-vectors in the @xmath106-plane .",
    "the vector potential @xmath107 ( up to a gauge ) can be written , in terms of the magnetic flux @xmath0 , as @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the unit vector at @xmath111 tangent to the circle @xmath112 : @xmath113 we shall set @xmath114 and use ( [ vp - flux ] ) to rewrite the quantities @xmath115 of ( [ ab - op-1 ] ) as @xmath116 where the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath115 has been rendered explicit on the left .",
    "the problem is to define the formal quantities @xmath117 and @xmath118 in ( [ p - a ] ) as operators on the hilbert space @xmath119 ; excision of a single point , here the origin @xmath96 , has no real effect on an @xmath120-space , but  as we have seen earlier  changing the domains of differentiation operators ever so slightly can have drastic consequences .",
    "reeh chose , for the common domain of @xmath121 , the space @xmath122 of smooth functions with compact support on @xmath123 .",
    "the space @xmath122 is dense in @xmath124 , and @xmath117 and @xmath118 are distributions on it . if @xmath125 , then it follows from @xmath126 that @xmath127\\varphi = 0 $ ] .",
    "consider now the equation @xmath128 it is a linear homogeneous differential equation of the first order which can be solved explicitly for any @xmath129 , and the same holds for the equation @xmath130 .",
    "the solutions do not have compact support . by exploiting these solutions , reeh established the following results",
    "@xcite :    1 .   the operators @xmath117 and @xmath118 are not self - adjoint ; they are essentially self - adjoint .",
    "2 .   let @xmath131 and @xmath132 be their self - adjoint extensions , and define @xmath133 then @xmath134[\\epsilon(y ) - \\epsilon(y - b)]}\\,i ,   \\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the identity operator , and @xmath135                 -1&\\;\\;t<1 .",

    "it follows that if @xmath2 is an integer , then the right - hand side of ( [ reeh - comm ] ) equals the identity operator @xmath23 _ for all admissible _ @xmath139 , but _ not _ if @xmath2 is not an integer ; in this case the group generated by the operators @xmath140 is no longer isomorphic with the weyl group @xmath141 . clearly , the groups generated by these operators for @xmath142 are not isomorphic with each other if @xmath143 is not an integer , and therefore the representations of the ccr ( for two degrees of freedom ) they define are not unitarily equivalent .    the experiment suggested in section  [ sec - scheme ]",
    "is designed to determine whether this mathematical inequivalence has observable physical consequences .",
    "if superseparability is observed with charged boson beams , then  irrespective of the psychological effect of the observation  it will confirm that the notion of inequivalent irreducible representations of the ccr ( for a finite number of degrees of freedom ) is physically meaningful ; vectors from two inequivalent representations can not be superposed upon each other .",
    "it should then prompt the investigation of other possible effects that arise from the existence of inequivalent irreducible representations of the ccr .",
    "note that the discussion is at the level of the first quantization .",
    "2 .   if , however , the phenomenon is _ not observed _ , we shall have to conclude that something basic is lacking in our understanding of the linear space that underlies quantum mechanics : the question that david hilbert asked rolf nevanlinna in the late 1920 s  _ tell me , rolf , what is this hilbert space that the young people are talking about ? _  may not yet have been answered to the physicist s satisfaction .",
    "3 .   the theoretical considerations of section [ sec - reeh ] do not apply to fermions .",
    "the creation - annihilation operators for a fermion are bounded , and the canonical anticommutation relations for a finite number of degrees of freedom have only one irreducible unitary reprsentation .",
    "this was proved by jordan and wigner in their very first paper on anticommutation relations in 1928 .",
    "therefore one should not expect to find the phenomenon of superseparability among fermions . if the experiment is performed with electrons and superseparability _",
    "is _ observed , it will pose new and unsettling problems for theoretical physics .",
