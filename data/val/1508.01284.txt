    "in noncommutative quantum field theory , the use of coherent states has allowed the implementation of commutation relations among coordinates without violating lorentz invariance  @xcite ; further developments have established a deep relationship with the noncommutative voros product  @xcite .",
    "the main lesson learned from these works is that point - like sources should be replaced by smeared distributions , actually gaussian distributions , depending on the noncommutative parameter @xmath0 ; in the limit of vanishing @xmath0 , the standard expressions for green s functions in quantum field theory are recovered .",
    "these ideas have been applied recently to gravitational systems  @xcite and the analysis of classical black holes , such as the schwarzschild or the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) spacetime , has been performed .",
    "as it is well known , these two black holes are special cases of more general models involving nonlinear electrodynamics that reduce to maxwell s electrodynamics in certain limits .    among them",
    ", born - infeld ( bi ) electrodynamics  @xcite has received a lot of attention since its formulation , arising in several contexts such as in the analysis of the low - energy effective action for an open superstring  @xcite or in the low - energy dynamics of d - branes  @xcite ; different aspects of the associated black holes have been studied in the literature  @xcite .",
    "additionally , in the presence of a gravitational field , the einstein field equations admit a black hole solution  @xcite ; in the static case , the ebion is the corresponding spherically symmetric solution  @xcite .",
    "these black hole solutions are the nonlinear generalization of the rn black hole solutions ; they are described by the mass @xmath1 and the charge @xmath2 of the black hole in addition to the bi parameter @xmath3 , directly related to the strength of the electromagnetic field at the position of the charge .    in this paper",
    "we construct two noncommutative models of anti - de sitter - einstein - born - infeld ( adsebi ) spacetime using smeared distributions for the mass and charge of the black hole ; the sources of the gravitational field have then a noncommutative origin .",
    "the interest on these models lies first on the natural generalization of well - known results on black hole thermodynamics using maxwell s electrodynamics .",
    "additionally , this approach allows us to introduce a fundamental length scale that can be related to quantum gravity effects and black holes should certainly be affected by them  @xcite .",
    "the models provide also a nice illustration of the changing behavior of thermodynamical quantities when the noncommutative parameter is turn on ; the influence on critical points is clearly seen and phase transitions also exist .",
    "moreover , explicit calculations can be performed in spite of the nontrivial nature of both the nonlinear electrodynamics and the noncommutative deformation ; the amount of work involved in obtaining a solution to the noncommutative gravitational field equations is similar to that of the usual case .",
    "this represents an important advantage for the study of quantum effects on gravity since we have then a nonpertubative treatment of black holes in general that allows close comparison with the standard results .",

    "[ sec2 ] , we review the einstein - born - infeld ( ebi ) solution and formulate two noncommutative models , first by considering a noncommutative distribution of mass and then by using a noncommutative distribution of charge ; the analysis of the metric is presented for both cases .",

    "we have analyzed the influence of noncommutativity in the thermodynamic properties of the bi black hole . as a first step",
    ", we obtained the generic expressions for the mass and the temperature as a function of the horizon radius for arbitrary dimensions when a noncommutative modification of the mass term is performed ; this change involves the replacement of the classical point like behavior by a smeared distribution . in ( 3 + 1)-dimensions ,",
    "the @xmath66 diagrams are quite similar to the commutative case and the critical points are found by solving a nonhomogeneous cubic equation , contrary to the classical case where the nonhomogeneous term is absent . since this equation is more involved that in the commutative case , an explicit expression for the critical values is hard to obtain , however it can be plotted showing the existence of critical points where classically they are forbidden .",
    "the gibbs function when plotted as a function of the temperature for fixed pressure shows the existence of critical points as well and the commutative case is also reproduced ; phase transitions may or not exist depending on the values of the noncommutative parameter .",
    "we also considered a noncommutative deformation of the source giving rise to the bi electromagnetic field .",
    "as in the first model , the relevant expressions for the mass and temperature were obtained for arbitrary dimensions and later specialized for ( 3 + 1)-dimensions .",
    "the @xmath66 diagrams have some similarities with the classical case but there are also important differences ; they show a more smooth behavior .",
    "this is also seen in the plots of the function defining the critical points of the model , where noncommutativity makes this function to take higher values rapidly when compared with the classical case . in this case",
    "the gibbs function shows a behavior similar to the schwarzschild solution for @xmath0 and @xmath3 varying , nevertheless some differences can be appreciated .",
