    "in conventional metals the scattering between quasiparticles ( fermions ) and lattice vibrations ( bosons ) is the microscopic mechanism that determines the transport and the optical properties . at low temperatures",

    "the critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition , that is of the order of a few degrees , is determined by the electron - phonon coupling constant , i.e. @xmath6=@xmath7 , through the mcmillan s formula @xcite .    in the cuprate superconductors , the electronic correlations are responsible for the emergence of complex orders , influencing the phase diagram even far from the antiferromagnetic insulating phase at zero doping .",

    "an `` effective '' description of the generic interaction between quasiparticles and excitations of both electronic and phononic nature , whose distribution at a given temperature follows the bose - einstein statistics , can be obtained by replacing the @xmath5 with a more general electron - boson coupling function @xcite , i.e. , the _ bosonic function _",

    "although a main effort has been recently made @xcite , the determination of the relative weight of the electronic and phononic contributions to @xmath8 remains elusive , since the electronic and phononic excitations coexist on the 0 - 90 mev energy scale .",
    "solving this problem would constitute a step forward to unravel the puzzle of superconductivity in cuprates , while addressing the major question whether or not high - temperature superconductivity can be described in terms of a generalized eliashberg formalism , in which the attractive interaction is retarded , i.e. , mediated by virtual bosonic excitations of novel origin @xcite .",

    "the calculated @xmath101 , reported in figure 5 ( black line ) , is very similar to the reflectivity variation obtained in the case of a constant density of states at t=300 k ( see figure 4 ) and is related to the impulsive increase of the scattering rate and broadening of the drude peak ; + b ) the impulsive filling of the pseudogap , as a consequence of the photoinjection of excess excitations .",
    "the @xmath101 is calculated assuming that the value @xmath147(0,t ) is impulsively quenched from 0.7 to 0.9 .",
    "the corresponding change in the density of states is shown in the top - right inset of fig .",
    "the result ( see blue curve in figure 5 ) is very different from the @xmath101 expected for an impulsive heating of the bosons .",
    "very similar results are obtained by assuming the closing of the gap ( @xmath144@xmath15@xmath148 ) instead of its filling ; + c ) the impulsive decrease of the total @xmath8 .",
    "although @xmath64 and @xmath65 are expected to be doping- and temperature - independent , @xmath149 could increase as the doping and the temperature decrease because either new magnetic excitations coupled with qps emerge in the pseudogap phase @xcite or electronic correlations induce a non - fermi liquid like increase of the self - energy at the antinodes .",
    "@xmath101 is calculated by assuming a small quench of the peak at 60 mev of the bosonic function ( bottom - right inset of fig .",
    "the result ( red solid line ) is reported in figure 5 and can be rationalized in terms of an impulsive decrease of the coupling and consequent narrowing of the drude peak , that is , the opposite effect to the transient heating of bosons .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the use of non - equilibrium optical spectroscopy can be extended to doping and temperature regimes in which a pseudogap opens and electronic correlations strongly affect the electronic properties of the system .",
    "non - equilibrium optical spectroscopy is important and effective for investigating the physics of the cuprate superconductors and , more in general , of strongly correlated electron materials . adding the temporal degree of freedom to the frequency resolution of equilibrium optical spectroscopy , allows disentangling the electronic and phononic contributions to the eliashberg _ bosonic function _",
    "@xmath8 in a prototypical cuprate , i.e. optimally - doped y - bi2212 .",
    "our results demonstrate that , in principle , the strength of the coupling of quasiparticles to bosons of electronic origin can account for the high - critical temperature of the system ( @xmath11=96 k ) .",
    "this result supports a description of high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates in terms of an attractive interaction , mediated by virtual bosonic excitations of electronic origin , where the most prominent candidates are spin fluctuations and loop currents .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of the data obtained from non - equilibrium optical spectroscopy relies on a formalism ( the extended drude model ) that can be easily extended to more complex cases , e.g. , systems with a gap in the density of states .",
    "this is very promising for further experiments aimed at investigating the elusive nature of the region of the cuprate phase diagram , in which a `` pseudogap '' in the density of states is present .",
    "finally , the techniques described here can be easily extended to other complex materials , such as different classes of transition - metal oxides and iron - based superconductors .",
    "these new experimental and theoretical tools , developed to investigate the electronic properties of correlated materials out of equilibrium , open intriguing perspectives for the next - years materials science .",
    "the modeling of the interaction of ultrashort light pulses with correlated materials is still at its infancy .",
    "the use of the `` effective '' temperatures and of the extended drude models to describe the non - equilibrium dynamics on the sub - ps timescale has been proved to be a very effective tool to carry out a quantitative analysis of the data and single out the different contributions to the pump - induced modification of the dielectric function .",
    "nonetheless , these approximations can not account for other important processes that play an important role in the femtosecond dynamics of strongly correlated materials .",
    "in particular : + -the origin of the interplay between high - energy mott - like excitations at 1.5 - 2 ev and the onset of high - temperature superconductivity , recently demonstrated by non - equilibrium optical spectroscopy @xcite , is still an open question directly related to the nature of the superconducting phase in cuprates .",
    "+ -the * k*-space distribution of the nascent population , after interaction with a femtosecond light pulse , can have strongly non - thermal features , such as an excess of excitations at the antinodes @xcite .",
    "this feature could provide the access to novel non - thermal phases @xcite , in which superconductivity can be controlled by means of light pulses .",
    "the joint effort of emerging theoretical tools , like non - equilibrium dmft @xcite and time - dependent gutzwiller approach @xcite and time - resolved experiments probing different physical properties , like time - resolved optical and photoemission spectroscopies and time - resolved electron diffraction , will provide the key to understand the role of the electronic correlations in controlling the ultrafast electronic properties in unconventional superconductors and transition - metal oxides .",
