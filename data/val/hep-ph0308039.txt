    "as the @xmath0 factories @xcite continue to accumulate large data samples , an increasing number of different @xmath0-decay modes becomes accessible to investigation .",
    "many of these modes carry interesting information on cp - violating interactions or hadronic flavor - changing neutral currents , but except for a number of decay channels considered `` theoretically clean '' a theoretical framework is required to correct for the effects of the strong interaction .    for a long time",
    ", exclusive two - body @xmath0-decay amplitudes have been estimated in the `` naive '' factorization approach ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) or modifications thereof . in many cases",
    "this approach provides the correct order of magnitude of branching fractions , but it can not predict direct cp asymmetries due to the assumption of no strong rescattering . it is therefore no longer adequate for a detailed phenomenological analysis of @xmath0-factory data .",
    "naive factorization has now been superseded by qcd factorization @xcite .",
    "although not yet proved rigorously , this scheme provides the means to compute two - body decay amplitudes from first principles .",
    "its accuracy is limited only by power corrections to the heavy - quark limit and the uncertainties of theoretical inputs such as quark masses , form factors , and light - cone distribution amplitudes . for the charmless",
    "decays considered in this paper the lowest - order approximation in qcd factorization coincides with `` naive '' factorization .    among the charmless hadronic @xmath0",
    "decays , the modes @xmath15 and @xmath16 have been studied first and most extensively within qcd factorization @xcite , because they are the simplest decays for which a significant interference of tree and penguin amplitudes is expected .",
    "other specific final states that have been investigated include those with vector mesons and exotic mesons @xcite , as well as @xmath17 or @xmath18 along with a pseudoscalar or vector kaon @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we complete the phenomenology of hadronic @xmath0 decays into two light pseudoscalar mesons or one pseudoscalar and one vector meson , all from the ground - state nonet .",
    "we consider the complete set of 96 decay modes , including decays of @xmath19 mesons , and decays into mesons with flavor - singlet components .",
    "we also summarize in a compact notation all the required decay coefficients and hard - scattering kernels up to the next - to - leading order in @xmath4 . in a series of recent papers @xcite du et al .",
    "have considered a subset of these decay modes , including decays of @xmath19 mesons . in @xcite",
    "fits to the data on pseudoscalar  vector meson final states based on the generalization of the hard - scattering kernels of @xcite to these final states have been performed . while we agree qualitatively with the conclusions reached from these fits",
    ", we believe that it is currently more useful to investigate in more detail the dynamical origin of agreements and discrepancies with experimental data . in this respect",
    "the analysis presented in this paper is more complete than the fits performed previously as far as decay channels , error estimates , and analysis of observables are concerned .",
    "the motivation for our analysis is threefold : first , the larger set of decay channels provides additional information on the ckm phase @xmath20 and on hadronic flavor - changing currents , complementary to the @xmath21 and @xmath22 final states .",
    "second , the different strong - interaction dynamics underlying specific decay modes provides valuable tests of the qcd factorization framework .",
    "being able to compute correctly a large number of decays , including `` uninteresting '' ones , increases our confidence in the reliability of the approach where it is necessary to extract fundamental parameters .",
    "an example of this concerns the role of so - called scalar penguin operators , which are an important contribution to the penguin amplitude in decays to pions and kaons , but which are expected to be suppressed for decays into vector mesons @xcite .",
    "finally , our analysis provides up - to - date expectations for the branching fractions of decay modes yet to be discovered .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the rather technical section  [ sec : amps ] we briefly review the qcd factorization approach and then collect the notation , definitions , and analytic formulae required to compute the complete set of @xmath11 and @xmath12 decay amplitudes at next - to - leading order .",
    "this includes a new notation for the parameterization of flavor amplitudes , which we find more convenient than the conventional notation in terms of parameters @xmath23 .",
    "sections  [ sec : inputs ] and [ sec : strategy ] contain a summary of the input parameters entering our analysis and an outline of the adopted analysis strategy for the large set of final states . also included in section  [ sec :",
    "strategy ] is a discussion of the @xmath24 tree amplitude .",
    "we then analyze separately penguin - dominated @xmath25 and @xmath26 decays , and tree - dominated @xmath26 decays in sections  [ sec : penguins ] and [ sec : trees ] , respectively .",
    "we begin with an investigation of the magnitude of the penguin amplitude in @xmath25 decays , which dominates the overall decay rate .",
    "the factorization approach makes distinct predictions for this amplitude depending on whether the final state is @xmath1 , @xmath2 , or @xmath27 .",
    "the comparison with existing data provides important information on the usefulness of next - to - leading order calculations in qcd factorization and simultaneously on the magnitude of penguin weak annihilation .",
    "we proceed to discuss ratios of branching fractions , and a few observations that we find difficult to accommodate in the standard model : we quantify the correction to the measurement of @xmath28 in the final states @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and we define a new ratio involving the @xmath31 final state that may suggest an anomaly in the electroweak penguin sector .",
    "we also consider penguin - dominated @xmath26 decays , which have small branching fractions , and discuss empirical constraints on the size of weak annihilation contributions .",
    "section  [ sec : trees ] on tree - dominated decays focuses on the information that results from the measurement of @xmath8 final states .",
    "in addition to cp - averaged branching fractions , direct cp asymmetries , and certain ratios of branching fractions , we consider the five asymmetries that can be defined in the time - dependent study of the final states @xmath32 .",
    "we find that the asymmetry @xmath33 is well - suited to constrain @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath33 together with the analogous quantity in @xmath34 decay imply @xmath35 with an error of about @xmath36 at @xmath37 . in this analysis as in the rest of the paper we adopt the quasi two - body assumption , which considers the vector mesons as stable , neglecting interference effects related to the non - negligible widths of the decaying vector mesons .    in section  [ sec : etas ]",
    "we summarize the results for final states containing @xmath17 or @xmath18 , which complete those of @xcite , where an additional @xmath38 or @xmath39 in the final state was assumed .",
    "we briefly discuss the decays of @xmath19 mesons in section  [ sec : bs ] , and conclude in section  [ sec : concl ] . in three appendices",
    "we collect : ( i )  the complete set of decay amplitudes expressed in terms of the amplitude parameters @xmath40 ( formerly @xmath23 ) and @xmath41 , including weak annihilation ; ( ii )  the convolutions of the new hard - scattering kernels with the distribution amplitudes of vector mesons up to the second gegenbauer moment ; and ( iii )  the results of the babar , belle , and cleo experiments , from which we computed the experimental averages used in the paper .      since",
    ", in the course of time , this paper has grown to an undue volume , we have structured it such that most sections can be read independently of each other .",
    "most of the material in section  2 and appendices  a and b provides an up - to - date summary of the technical work necessary to implement qcd factorization at next - to - leading order .",
    "the reader familiar with the basic ideas of the theoretical framework may read only section  [ sec : qcdf ] .",
    "the reader interested only in specific phenomenological applications should consult sections  [ sec : inputs ] and [ sec : strategy ] ( omitting perhaps section  [ sec : treeamplitude ] ) and the introduction to section  [ sec : penguins ] , where we specify the theoretical input , the general strategy of the analysis , and the definition of specific analysis scenarios .",
    "the analysis sections [ sec : treeamplitude ] ( tree amplitude in @xmath15 decays ) , [ sec : penguins ] ( penguin - dominated decays ) , [ sec : trees ] ( tree - dominated decays ) , [ sec : etas ] ( final states with @xmath17 or @xmath42 ) , and [ sec : bs ] ( @xmath19 decays ) could then be read independently .",
    "in this section we detail the theoretical framework within which our results for the decay amplitudes are computed . we begin with a brief summary of the qcd factorization method .",
    "we then introduce a new notation for the basic transition operator @xmath43 , which allows us to describe pseudoscalar and vector mesons in the final two - body state in terms of a single expression .",
    "the decay amplitude for @xmath44 is proportional to the matrix element @xmath45 .",
    "the transition operator is decomposed into a complete basis of `` flavor operators '' accounting for the different topologies of the various decay mechanisms ( tree , penguin , annihilation , etc . ) . after a summary of light - cone distribution amplitudes",
    "we collect the results for the coefficients of the different terms in the transition operator .",
    "this discussion is necessarily rather technical , as one of our goals is to provide a reference for the decay amplitudes and hard - scattering kernels in qcd factorization at next - to - leading order . some readers may wish to read only section  [ sec : qcdf ] and then continue with section  [ sec : inputs ] .",
    "a detailed discussion of the qcd factorization approach can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we recapitulate the basic formulae to set up the notation .",
    "the effective weak hamiltonian for charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays consists of a sum of local operators @xmath46 multiplied by short - distance coefficients @xmath47 and products of elements of the quark mixing matrix , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 can be a down or strange quark depending on the decay mode under consideration , and @xmath50 . using the unitarity relation @xmath51 we write @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the left - handed current ",
    "current operators arising from @xmath54-boson exchange , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are qcd and electroweak penguin operators , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the electromagnetic and chromomagnetic dipole operators as given in @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian describes the quark transitions @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 with @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , @xmath64 , as appropriate for decay modes with interference of `` tree '' and `` penguin '' contributions .",
    "the wilson coefficients are evaluated at next - to - leading order , consistent with the calculation of operator matrix elements described below . for the coefficients of electroweak penguin operators the evaluation described in @xcite , which incorporates some terms",
    "normally counted as next - to - next - to - leading order , is employed .",
    "the qcd factorization formalism allows us to compute systematically the matrix elements of the effective weak hamiltonian in the heavy - quark limit for certain two - body final states @xmath65 .",
    "in condensed notation , the matrix element of every operator in the effective hamiltonian is evaluated as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is an appropriate form factor , @xmath68 are leading - twist light - cone distribution amplitudes , and the star products imply an integration over the light - cone momentum fractions of the constituent quarks inside the mesons .",
    "a graphical representation of this result is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "whenever the spectator antiquark line goes from the @xmath69 meson to one of the final - state mesons we call this meson @xmath70 and the other one @xmath71 .",
    "the sum in the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ fact ] ) accounts for the possibility that for particular final states the spectator antiquark can end up in either one of the two mesons .",
    "if the spectator antiquark is annihilated we use the convention that @xmath70 is the meson that carries away the antiquark from the weak decay vertex .",
    "a justification of the factorization formula for final states in which @xmath70 is a heavy meson ( applicable to @xmath72 mesons in the heavy - quark limit ) can be found in @xcite . in this case",
    "the term in the second line of ( [ fact ] ) is absent . for final states with two light mesons factorization has been proved at order @xmath4 @xcite , but a complete proof has not yet been given ( for recent developments in this direction , see @xcite ) .",
    "the factorization formula reduces the complicated hadronic matrix elements of four - quark operators to simpler non - perturbative quantities and calculable hard - scattering kernels @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in this paper",
    "we complete the calculation of all relevant kernels at next - to - leading order in @xmath4 .",
    "the light - cone expansion implies that only leading - twist distribution amplitudes are needed in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "there exist however a number of subleading quark ",
    "antiquark distribution amplitudes of twist  3 , which have large normalization factors for pseudoscalar mesons , e.g.  for the pion @xmath75 for realistic @xmath76-quark masses these `` chirally - enhanced '' terms are not much suppressed numerically .",
    "we therefore include in our analysis all quark ",
    "antiquark twist-3 amplitudes .",
    "( the quark  antiquark  gluon amplitude at twist-3 does not have an anomalously large normalization . ) in order to perform the same analysis for all final states we also include the quark ",
    "antiquark twist-3 amplitudes for vector mesons , even though there is no particular enhancement in this case , @xmath77 being replaced by @xmath78 times a ratio of two decay constants ( see below ) , with @xmath79 the vector - meson mass .",
    "the inclusion of chirally - enhanced terms is important to account for the large branching fractions of penguin - dominated decay modes with pseudoscalar final - state mesons , such as @xmath16 @xcite , but it also causes a number of conceptual problems .",
    "factorization is not expected to hold at subleading order in @xmath3 and , somewhat unfortunately , is indeed violated by some of the chirally - enhanced terms @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the leading - twist distribution amplitudes , the twist-3 two - particle amplitudes do not vanish at the endpoints but rather approach constants .",
    "the kernels @xmath73 in the first term of the factorization formula also approach constants at the endpoints ( modulo logarithms ) , and hence there is no difficulty with this term .",
    "these kernels include the important scalar penguin amplitude mentioned in the introduction , conventionally denoted by @xmath80 .",
    "however , the second term in the factorization formula , which accounts for the interactions with the spectator quark , contains integrals that are dominated by the endpoint regions if the distribution amplitudes do not vanish at the endpoint .",
    "these integrals formally diverge logarithmically in a perturbative framework .",
    "this implies a non - factorizable soft interaction with the spectator quark , while @xmath70 is formed in a highly asymmetric configuration , in which one quark carries almost all the momentum of the meson .",
    "similar factorization - breaking effects occur in weak annihilation contributions , which are also suppressed by at least one power of @xmath3 in the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "in @xcite we have parameterized the power corrections from chirally - enhanced and weak annihilation terms in an _ ad hoc _ way and included a variation of the corresponding parameters in our error estimate . based on the analysis of @xmath21 and @xmath22 final states we concluded that these factorization - breaking terms introduce a sometimes substantial uncertainty into the theory but do not render the framework unpredictive .",
    "in particular , the data so far give no indication that these corrections should be outside the range specified by our error estimate .",
    "given this situation , we follow our previous analysis strategy as regards twist-3 and annihilation effects .",
    "the inclusion of twist-3 effects for vector mesons then allows us to estimate the impact of some power - suppressed effects , which turn out to be small .",
    "but we should stress that this is far from a complete account of such contributions .",
    "we also note that some other classes of power corrections have been analyzed using the method of light - cone qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which contain a flavor - singlet component in their wave function , require special attention , because they can be formed from two gluons at leading twist .",
    "the new effects associated with this possibility have been worked out in the context of qcd factorization in @xcite . for these mesons the factorization formula ( [ fact ] )",
    "holds provided it is extended by an additional non - local form - factor term . at the order we are working the corresponding complications",
    "do not appear for vector mesons , since they do not have a two - gluon component .",
    "there is , however , one novel effect for neutral vector mesons , namely that they can be produced via a virtual photon .",
    "although this effect is very small , we shall discuss it , because it is of the same order as other electroweak contributions to the decay amplitudes .      in the literature on qcd factorization",
    "the result of computing the hard - scattering kernels for the various operators in the effective weak hamiltonian is usually presented in terms of `` factorized operators '' with coefficients @xmath81 .",
    "( the matrix element of a factorized operator is simply proportional to a form factor times a decay constant . )",
    "the reasons for this are largely historical .",
    "besides containing some redundancy , such a notation leads to inconveniences for vector mesons since the factorized operator @xmath82 vanishes , while there exist non - vanishing terms at order @xmath4 that one would naturally associate with the corresponding coefficient @xmath80 . here",
    "we introduce a new notation that eliminates these inconveniences , and which at the same time is sufficiently general and explicit to facilitate the construction of the decay amplitude for any particular decay with either pseudoscalar or vector mesons in the final state .",
    "the main point of the new notation is to keep track of only the flavor structure of an operator .",
    "its dirac structure , which distinguishes some of the @xmath81 coefficients in the conventional notation , becomes irrelevant , since operators with different dirac structure ( but identical flavor structure ) always contribute in the same combination to a particular set of final states .",
    "we first introduce our phase convention for the flavor wave functions .",
    "we take the light quark triplet as @xmath83 and the antitriplet as @xmath84 .",
    "consequently , @xmath85 assuming isospin symmetry , the non - singlet members of the light nonet of pseudoscalar mesons are given by @xmath86 and analogous expressions hold for the corresponding vector mesons .",
    "the treatment of mesons containing a flavor - singlet component in their wave function has been explained in detail in the dedicated paper @xcite , to which we refer the reader for all details .",
    "the meson @xmath17 ( and similarly @xmath18 and the vector mesons @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) can be treated as a coherent superposition of the flavor components @xmath89 this should not be confused with the representation of the meson state as a superposition of flavor states , but simply means that these mesons have matrix elements of @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( or @xmath92 , these two being equal due to the assumed isospin symmetry ) operators that are a priori unrelated .",
    "consequently , each meson is described by two decay constants ; for instance , for the @xmath17 meson @xmath93 similarly , there are two transition form factors , two leading - twist quark ",
    "antiquark distribution amplitudes etc . ,",
    "corresponding to the two distinct flavor components .",
    "in addition , for the pseudoscalar case there exist contributions proportional to the two - gluon content of @xmath17 and @xmath42 .",
    "finally , certain contributions to the @xmath94 amplitude are conveniently interpreted in terms of @xmath95 flavor components @xmath96 , @xmath97 for @xmath17 and @xmath42 .",
    "the qcd factorization approach presented here is sufficiently general to allow for a discussion of states containing flavor - singlet contributions without assumption of a particular flavor - mixing scheme .",
    "however , in our phenomenological analysis we will adopt the feldmann  kroll ",
    "stech scheme for @xmath17 and @xmath42 mixing , in which it is sufficient to introduce a single mixing angle in the flavor basis @xcite .",
    "the corresponding expressions for the hadronic matrix elements ( decay constants , form factors , etc . ) needed in the calculations of the decay amplitudes can be found in @xcite .",
    "for the vector mesons @xmath87 and @xmath88 we will assume ideal mixing , so that @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "we match the effective weak hamiltonian onto a transition operator such that its matrix element is given by @xmath100 the two terms account for the flavor topologies of the form - factor and hard - scattering terms in ( [ fact ] ) , respectively , corresponding to the two diagrams of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "each term in the transition operator contains several operators labeled only by the flavor composition of the four - quark final state .",
    "note that below we will include in the definition of @xmath101 also some power - suppressed terms , such as weak annihilation contributions .",
    "including electroweak penguin topologies there are six different flavor structures one can write down for the left diagram of figure  [ fig1 ] .",

    "the coefficients @xmath109 contain all dynamical information , while the arguments of @xmath110 encode the flavor composition of the final state and hence determine the final state to which a given term can contribute .",
    "we define @xmath111[\\ldots ] )     |\\bar b_{q_s}\\rangle\\equiv c\\,\\alpha_i^p(m_1 ' m_2')\\,a_{m_1 ' m_2'}\\ ] ] whenever the quark flavors of the first ( second ) square bracket match those of @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the constant @xmath114 is a product of three factors of @xmath115 , @xmath116 etc .  from the flavor composition of the @xmath69 meson and @xmath117 as specified above .",

    "the decay constants @xmath124 are normalized according to @xmath125 for a vector meson , @xmath126 always refers to the decay constant of a longitudinally polarized meson .",
    "we neglect corrections to the decay amplitudes quadratic in the light meson masses , so that all form factors are evaluated at @xmath127 .",
    "( at this kinematic point , the form factors @xmath128 and @xmath129 coincide .",
    ") parameters referring to the @xmath0 meson depend on whether the decaying meson is @xmath19 or @xmath130 .",
    "this will be implicitly understood in the following .",
    "the above expression can be simplified by replacing @xmath131 , since the left - hand side squared and summed over the polarizations of the vector meson gives @xmath132 ( neglecting again quadratic meson - mass corrections ) .",
    "as expected by angular momentum conservation the final - state vector meson is longitudinally polarized . when the replacement above is done the polarization sum for vector mesons",
    "must be omitted , and the decay rate is simply given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 if @xmath112 and @xmath113 are identical , and @xmath135 otherwise .",
    "we do not discuss in this paper final states containing two vector mesons .",
    "the extension to this case is straightforward , since the leading amplitude in the heavy - quark limit is the one for two longitudinally polarized vector mesons , which in many ways behave like pseudoscalar mesons .    in order to exemplify the notation",

    "the spectator quark can go to either one of the two mesons , so @xmath70 can be @xmath138 or @xmath139 .",

    "we now discuss the flavor structure of the hard - scattering term in ( [ fact ] ) , i.e. , the second diagram in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "since all six quarks participate in the hard scattering , the generic flavor operator in @xmath101 is of the form @xmath145[\\bar q_{m_2 } q_{m_2}][\\bar q_s b])$ ] with possible sums over quarks from penguin transitions or flavor - singlet conversion @xmath146 .",

    "indeed , there is no rigorous information available on the parameter @xmath292 of the @xmath0-meson distribution amplitude , and although the light - cone distribution amplitude of the pion is now believed to be close to the asymptotic form already at small scales ( disfavoring a large gegenbauer moment @xmath439 ) , the calculations of the low - energy hadronic processes from which this information is extracted may have significant theoretical uncertainties . furthermore , the heavy - to - light form factors at @xmath127 are usually taken from qcd sum - rule calculations , but it now appears that these form factors exhibit a substantially more complex dynamics than @xmath551 form factors or pion transition form factors .",
    "it remains to be investigated whether the dynamics of these transitions at large momentum transfer is adequately represented in the sum - rule framework .",
    "all @xmath5 and @xmath6 two - body decays with kaons in the final state are dominated by penguin amplitudes .",
    "the modes with a single kaon are based on @xmath25 transitions and have `` large '' branching ratios of order few times @xmath495 to few times @xmath496 .",
    "modes with two kaons proceed through @xmath26 transitions and therefore are expected to have smaller branching fractions . in this section we focus on decays without @xmath17 or @xmath42 mesons in the final state . these modes will be studied in section  [ sec : etas ] .",
    "a successful prediction for the branching ratios and cp asymmetries in rare @xmath0 decays requires theoretical control over the magnitudes and relative strong - interaction phases of tree topologies , penguin topologies , electroweak penguin topologies , and annihilation topologies .",
    "the fact that generically a given decay amplitudes receives several interfering contributions complicates the interpretation of the experimental data in terms of flavor topologies .",
    "we expect that our predictions for annihilation effects ( as modeled by the complex parameters @xmath552 and @xmath487 ) and for the strong phases of the various contributions are afflicted by the largest theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the former effects are incalculable within qcd factorization and so can only be estimated using a simple model .",
    "strong phases are predicted to vanish in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "the leading contributions to these phases are then of order @xmath4 and calculable , or of order @xmath553 and incalculable . since in practice the two expansion parameters @xmath4 and @xmath553 are not very different , we expect that our perturbative analysis at one - loop order can only give a rough estimate of the values of strong phases .",
    "while we do trust the generic prediction that these phases are small , we expect significant deviations from the values obtained at order @xmath4 from higher - order perturbative and power corrections .",
    "this expectation is indeed supported by an analysis of hadronic @xmath0 decays using the renormalon calculus @xcite .",
    "given these limitations , it is instructive to test the reliability of our predictions for the tree , penguin , and annihilation topologies in decays without interference of the different topologies .",
    "this will probe the magnitude of these topologies but not their strong - interaction phases .",
    "note that the penguin and annihilation terms can not be completely separated phenomenologically , since @xmath141 and @xmath512 always enter in the combination @xmath513 .",
    "however , some other annihilation contributions can be probed directly .    a discussion of the tree contribution to the decay @xmath24 has already been given in section  [ sec : treeamplitude ] . in the following",
    "we present a detailed study of penguin and annihilation terms , using penguin - dominated decay processes based on @xmath25 and @xmath26 transitions . for each class of decays we give explicit expressions for the decay",
    "amplitudes in terms of flavor parameters , adopting the approximations described earlier .",
    "we then present numerical predictions for the cp - averaged branching fractions and cp asymmetries and compare them with the world - average experimental data compiled in appendix  c. these results are always obtained using the exact representations of the decay amplitudes in terms of flavor parameters as given in appendix  a.    in the tables we first present our `` default results '' ( column labeled `` theory '' ) along with detailed error estimates corresponding to the different types of theoretical uncertainties detailed in section  [ sec : inputs ] .",
    "the first error shown corresponds to the variation of the ckm parameters @xmath397 , @xmath388 , and @xmath20 ( `` ckm '' ) , the second error refers to the variation of the renormalization scale , quark masses , decay constants ( except for transverse ones ) , form factors , and ( in later sections ) the @xmath17@xmath42 mixing angle ( `` hadronic 1 '' ) .",
    "the third error corresponds to the uncertainty due to the gegenbauer moments in the expansion of the light - cone distribution amplitudes , and also includes the scale - dependent transverse decay constants for vector mesons ( `` hadronic 2 '' ) .",
    "finally , the last error reflects our estimate of power corrections parameterized by the quantities @xmath362 and @xmath485 ( `` power '' ) , for which we adopt the form ( [ xhparam ] ) with @xmath554 and arbitrary strong phases @xmath555 .    in order to illustrate correlations between errors",
    "we explore four parameter scenarios in which certain parameters are changed within their error ranges while all others take their default values .",

    "this can be done using the form factors @xmath561 and @xmath562 , the standard model parameters @xmath563 and @xmath564mev , as well as the gegenbauer moments @xmath565mev and @xmath549 , all of which are within the error ranges specified earlier .",
    "* scenario s3 ( `` universal annihilation '' ) : + the dominant penguin coefficient @xmath499 , which includes the annihilation contribution @xmath512 , is rather sensitive to the parameter @xmath362 . while @xmath0 decays into two pseudoscalar mesons are well described by a small annihilation contribution , certain @xmath12 decay amplitudes favor a penguin coefficient that is larger than its default value . here",
    "we adopt the simplest model in which a moderate enhancement of @xmath499 is attributed to weak annihilation .",
    "specifically , we treat @xmath362 as a universal parameter obtained by using @xmath566 and a strong phase @xmath567",
    ". the sign of this phase is not predicted , but is chosen such that the sign of the direct cp asymmetry @xmath568 agrees with the data .",

    "this value is consistent with a less accurate result obtained from the corresponding quantity in the @xmath21 system ( if one takes the average of the two experiments , which are mutually incompatible ) .",

    "the comparison of the penguin - dominated final states @xmath22 , @xmath607 and @xmath608 allows for crucial tests of the factorization framework , since the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath27 penguin amplitudes take very different values for reasons specific to factorization .",
    "the @xmath607 data are indeed consistent with a smaller penguin amplitude ; however , as has been noted before @xcite , the reduction is not as large as predicted by theory .",
    "with default parameters one underestimates the amplitude by about 40% , but the theoretical error on the penguin amplitude for vector - meson final states is large , in particular the one from weak annihilation .",
    "this taken into account , the prediction may be in agreement with the measured branching fractions within their errors . however , the situation is not satisfactory , since one would wish to have an explanation of the data that does not invoke weak annihilation .",
    "the estimate of weak annihilation is necessarily model - dependent in the qcd factorization approach .",
    "in particular , the error range ( technically implemented by requiring @xmath609 ) has to be specified as an `` educated guess '' .",
    "it is therefore desirable to derive experimental constraints on weak annihilation .",
    "it was already found in @xcite that the @xmath22 branching fractions do not favor a sizable annihilation amplitude , since this would require a fine - tuning of its strong phase to keep the branching fraction small enough . on the other hand ,",
    "such a coincidence can not be excluded . assuming this to happen and further assuming universal annihilation amplitudes",
    ", we find that several branching fractions of pseudoscalar  vector final states , in particular @xmath9 , are much above the data for @xmath610 .",
    "this , together with an estimate of the pure annihilation mode @xmath611 @xcite , seem to imply that weak annihilation can not be much larger than the upper limit defined by the phenomenological treatment adopted in the present analysis and in @xcite .",
