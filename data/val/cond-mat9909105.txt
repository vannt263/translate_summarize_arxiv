    "the eigenvalue dynamics of the spectra of disordered systems in dependence of an external parameter has attracted considerable interest in recent years .",
    "it has been motivated by the fact that the conductance through a system is closely linked to the sensitivity of its eigenvalues on a perturbation @xcite . in this respect",
    "the work of akkermans and montambaux has to be mentioned in particular @xcite , who showed that the conductance can be expressed in terms of the quadratically averaged eigenvalue velocities , @xmath0    here the brackets denote a local average , and @xmath1 is the external parameter .",
    "later it was shown by simons and altshuler using supersymmetry techniques that the eigenvalue velocities @xmath2 should be gaussian distributed @xcite @xmath3    moreover , if the eigenvalues @xmath4 and the level dynamics parameter @xmath1 are rescaled according to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mean level spacing , the velocity autocorrelation function @xmath7 should obey a universal behaviour @xcite .",
    "a recent review on these questions can be found in @xcite .",
    "there are a number of attempts to study the autocorrelation function ( [ eqglobalac ] ) , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the systems under consideration ranged from the hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic field @xcite via conformally deformed @xcite and ray - splitting billiards @xcite to the acoustic spectra of vibrating quartz blocks @xcite . in all cases",
    "the overall behaviour predicted by simons and altshuler was more or less observed but in nearly all cases there had been significant deviations as well .",
    "this was our motivation to study velocity distributions and correlations in various mircowave billiards by applying different types of parameter variations .",
    "most to our surprise we found that the velocity distributions show a clear dependence on the type of parameter variation . only for the type classified as ` global ' below , we found simons and altshuler s universal behaviour , whereas for a second type denoted ` local ' a completely different behaviour was found .",
    "a preliminary version of this paper has been published already in @xcite .",
    "all results presented below have been obtained by taking the eigenfrequency spectra of billiard - shaped microwave cavities , shortly termed microwave billiards .",
    "the technique is described in @xcite . here",
    "it may be sufficient to note that in quasi - two - dimensional resonators , i.e. cavities with top and bottom plate parallel to each other , quantum mechanical and electromagnetic spectra are completely equivalent , as long as the maximum frequency @xmath8 is not surpassed , where @xmath9 is the height of the resonator . in the present experiment",
    "the height was 8 mm yielding a maximum frequency of 18.74 ghz .    in the very",
    "beginning it was not evident at all which billiard parameter should be varied . according to simons and",
    "altshuler the parameter @xmath1 ` could denote the strength of some field , like the aharonov - bohm flux through a ring , or a magnetic field , or the position of some impurity ' ( cited literally from ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in microwave billiards the magnetic field",
    "is not available as a parameter ( though the use of billiards with ferrite - coated walls may offer an alternative @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    "it is straightforward to study the spectra of microwave billiards as a function of some length @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field and the length variation have in common that already a small change in the parameter will modify the wavefunction everywhere .",
    "for this reason we call this type of level dynamics ` global '",
    ". the variation of the position of one impurity , on the other hand , can be easily performed in microwave billiards , with the additional advantage that , in contrast to real mesoscopic systems , we can control the disorder in every moment perfectly .",
    "the displacement of one impurity changes the value of the wave function only in its neighbourhood .",
    "consequently , we call this type of level dynamics ` local '",
    ".    both types of level dynamics were realized in the experiments .",
    "one of the systems studied was a quarter sinai billiard with width @xmath10=200 mm , radius @xmath11=70 mm of the quarter circle , and a length @xmath12 which was varied between 460 and 480 mm in steps of 0.2 mm .",
    "about 120 eigenvalues entered into the data analysis in the frequency range 14.5 to 15.5 ghz .",
    "the second system was a rectangular billiard with side lengths @xmath12=340 mm , @xmath10=240 mm , containing 19 circular disks with a diameter of 4.6 mm whose positions were determined by means of a random number generator .",
    "the position of one further disk was varied in one direction in steps of 1 mm .",
    "two different movable disks were used with diameters of 4.6 and 20 mm , respectively ( see fig . [ figsketch ] ) .",
    "a part of the level dynamic spectrum of the sinai billiard is shown in fig .",
    "[ figleveldyn ] ( left ) . as a function of length",
    "the resonances experience four to five avoided crossing in the studied length range .",
    "this is about the maximum range usable for the velocity correlation measurements for the following reason .",
    "upon variation of the length it happens that a node line of an eigenfunction passes the position of the coupling antenna , leading to a temporary loss of the eigenfrequency . in the studied",
    "length range each resonance disappeared at most once , but with increasing length range the tieing up of the open ends became more and more unreliable .",
    "the situation changes qualitatively of the level dynamics of the rectangular billiard with randomly distributed scatterers shown in fig .",
    "[ figleveldyn ] ( right ) .",
    "already a comparison by eyes shows that there is much more regularity in the latter case .",
    "now it is no problem to follow each eigenvalue over about 10 avoided crossings .",
    "we start with a discussion of the sinai billiard results . fig .",
    "[ figglobvel ] shows the found velocity distribution both on a linear and a logarithmic scale .",
    "the found distribution is close to a gaussian in accordance with the universal prediction .",
    "the dashed line is a modified bessel function which will become important in the following .",
    "it is well - known that non - generic features such as bouncing balls give rise to deviations from a gaussian distribution in particular in the region of the wings @xcite . in the measurement",
    "we therefore carefully avoided the regions disturbed by the dominating bouncing ball .",
    "hence such a disturbance does not show up in the present case .",
    "[ figglobac ] shows the corresponding velocity autocorrelation function . to obtain the result",
    ", each eigenvalue was followed over the available length range including four to five avoided crossings .",
    "the mean squared velocity needed for the scaling ( [ eqscale ] ) was calculated for each eigenvalue independently .",
    "subsequently the results of all eigenvalues were superimposed .",
    "such a procedure was mandatory , since the individual mean squared velocities showed large variations .",
    "for this reason a scaling with a globally calculated mean squared velocity did not give satisfactory results .    the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ figglobac ] corresponds to simons and altshuler s universal velocity correlation function .",
    "since an analytical expression for this quantity is not available , it was obtained from a random matrix simulation @xcite .",
    "the overall agreement between experiment and theory is good , apart from some small but significant deviations close to the minimum .",
    "it was already mentioned in the beginning that in most studied cases such an agreement was not found .",
    "whether a movable scatterer perturbs the system globally or locally , depends on its size , or , more precisely , on the parameter @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the diameter of the scatterer and @xmath15 the wavenumber . for small @xmath16 values ( @xmath17 ) a local level dynamics",
    "is expected , whereas with increasing @xmath16 values a gradual transition towards a global behaviour should be observed . fig .",
    "[ figlocvel ] shows the velocity distribution in the rectangular billiard with randomly distributed scatterers for three different @xmath16 ranges , again in a linear and a logarithmic plot . in fig .",
    "[ figlocvel](a ) the diameter of the movable disk was 4.6 mm , and the eigenvalues were taken in the range 3.4 to 6 ghz . in figs .",
    "[ figlocvel](b ) and ( c ) the diameter of the scatterer was 20 mm , and the eigenvalues were in the range 3.4 to 5.8 ghz and 12.5 to 14.3 ghz , respectively .    for small @xmath16 values the found velocity distribution is well described by a modified bessel function @xmath18    the logarithmic plot shows that this behaviour is found over two orders of magnitude .",
    "note that now asymptotically a single exponential behaviour is found in contrast to the gaussian behaviour observed for the global velocities .    with increasing @xmath16 values a transition to gaussian behaviour",
    "is observed as expected .",
    "we completed the sequence with a level dynamics in a sinai billiard , where the central circle was moved , corresponding to @xmath16 values between 30 and 40 . here",
    "the found velocities were again gaussian distributed ( not shown ) .    a corresponding deviation from the universal behaviour is found for the velocity autocorrelation functions .",
    "the left column of fig .",
    "[ figlocac ] shows the results for the same @xmath16 ranges as in fig .",
    "[ figlocvel ] .",
    "there is no similarity at all with the universal behaviour . only for the largest @xmath16 range",
    "the found correlation function seems to approach the universal function .",
    "all these findings are in striking contrast to all what has been expected by the experts",
    ". nevertheless , the discrepancy from the universal behaviour can be quite easily resolved .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the insertion of a metallic object into a quasi - two - dimensional microwave cavity shifts the eigenfrequencies to smaller frequencies .",
    "if the dimensions of the perturber are small compared to the wavelength , this shift is proportional to the square of the electric field . this technique has been used routinely for many years to map field distributions in microwave cavities @xcite and has recently been applied to the study of wave function in chaotic billiards as well @xcite .",
    "applied to the present problem this means that in the limit @xmath19 the eigenvalue velocities are given by @xmath20 where @xmath1 is the position of the scatterer , and @xmath21 is the gradient taken in the direction of the displacement .",
    "@xmath22 is a constant factor depending exclusively on the geometry of the perturber .",
    "it follows for the velocity distribution @xmath23 where the brackets denote an average of eigenvalues .",
    "this average can be calculated , if we assume that the wavefunction @xmath24 can be described by a random superposition of plane waves @xcite @xmath25 where the modulus of the wavenumbers of all waves contributing is the same , @xmath26 , but where amplitudes @xmath27 and directions @xmath28 are random .",
    "this approach has been proved extremely fruitful in the description of eigenfunctions in chaotic systems @xcite .    by means of the central limit theorem",
    "it is now an easy matter to show that under these assmptions @xmath29 and @xmath30 are uncorrelated and both gaussian distributed . with these ingredients",
    "the average ( [ eqvaverage ] ) can be calculated , resulting in the modified bessel function ( [ eqbessel ] ) for the velocity distribution . with help of the ansatz ( [ eqplanewaves ] )",
    "the velocity autocorrelation can be calculated as well , using standard techniques @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath31 '' = j_0 ^ 2(\\bar{x } ) - 2j_1 ^ 2(\\bar{x } ) - j_0(\\bar{x } ) j_2(\\bar{x } ) \\label{eqlocalac}\\ ] ] where @xmath32    note that in contrast to simons and altshuler s approach where the level dynamics parameter @xmath1 has been scaled by means of the square root of the quadratically averaged velocities , now we have got a straightforward scaling in terms of the wavenumber @xmath15 .    on the right column of fig .",
    "[ figlocac ] the same data shown on the left column are plotted again , but now with an abscissa scaled according to eq . ( [ eqnewx ] ) .",
    "the solid line has been calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eqlocalac ] ) .",
    "it describes the experimental results quite well .",
    "in particular the wavelengths of the oscillations are reproduced correctly even for the larger @xmath16 ranges .",
    "only an increasing damping of the oscillations with increasing @xmath16 is observed .",
    "this oscillatory behaviour in the velocity autocorrelation function , which is already evident from a visual inspection of fig .",
    "[ figleveldyn ] ( right ) , is in sharp contrast to the global case , where the autocorrelation function shows only one minimum , while all subsequent oscillations found for the individual levels are completely wiped out by averaging process .",
    "this work has shown that in contrast to our previous understanding there is not one but there are two regimes of universality . only for the global case",
    "where a small variation of the level dynamics parameter changes the wave functions everywhere , the universal velocity distributions and correlations predicted by simons and altshuler are really observed . in this range",
    "the scaling of the level dynamics parameter in terms of the square root of the quadratically averaged velocities is the appropriate one .    in the local limit ,",
    "on the other hand , realized in the present work by moving a small pertuber through a disordered system , another universal regime is observed . here",
    "the scaling of the level dynamics parameter in terms of the wave number is the correct one , and another class of velocity distributions and correlations is found , which has been discussed in this paper .",
