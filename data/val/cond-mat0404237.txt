    "the forces of friction and adhesion between two surfaces are determined by the interactions between atoms at their interface .",
    "most surfaces are rough enough that atoms are only close enough to interact strongly in areas where peaks or asperities on opposing surfaces overlap .",
    "experiments @xcite and theory @xcite show that this real area of contact @xmath3 is often much smaller than the projected area @xmath4 of the surfaces .",
    "they have also correlated @xcite the increase in friction with normal load @xmath5 to a corresponding increase in @xmath3 .    given the importance of @xmath3 it is not surprising that there have been many theoretical studies of the factors that determine it in different limits .",
    "some have examined the plastic limit where the local pressure is large enough to flatten asperities @xcite .",
    "the mean pressure in the contacts is @xmath6 and in the simplest model this has a constant value that is proportional to the hardness .",
    "the resulting linear relation between @xmath5 and @xmath3 is often given as an explanation for the linear rise of friction with load @xcite .",
    "the behavior of elastic contacts is more complicated . in the hertzian limit where friction and adhesion are ignored , the contact area between a sphere and a flat rises only as @xmath7 .",
    "however , greenwood and williamson s pioneering work @xcite showed that a nearly linear relation between @xmath5 and @xmath3 was obtained if one considered a large number of asperities of different height .",
    "while this calculation assumed spherical asperities with a uniform radius , a linear relation was also obtained when it was extended by bush _",
    "@xcite to include both a distribution of radii and aspherical asperities .",
    "these calculations consider explicit probability distributions for peaks and sum the hertzian contact areas calculated for each peak without including correlations between peaks .",
    "persson @xcite has recently presented a different approach , motivated by the fact that many surfaces have roughness on all length scales that can be described by self - affine scaling @xcite .",
    "his calculation considers the scaling of stress and contact area with the lengthscale to which surface features are resolved .",
    "nevertheless , his final result for @xmath3 only differs from the earlier work of bush _",
    "@xcite by a constant factor of @xmath8 .",
    "all of the above theories treat correlations between contacting regions approximately .",
    "models based on asperities ignore spatial correlations in asperity heights @xcite .",
    "persson s calculation includes height correlations and becomes exact in the limit of complete contact @xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath9 , correlations between local pressures and contacts are only included in an average way . as a result , screening of small bumps on the side of larger bumps , may not be included completely .",
    "such correlations could change @xmath3 , and also the distribution of pressure along the surface .",
    "the range over which @xmath3 is proportional to load is also difficult to determine from analytical theories . indeed , as discussed below , the work of bush _",
    "@xcite seems to suggest that the linear region is confined to infinitesimally small loads for a self - affine surface .    a recent numerical study by borri - brunetto _ et al .",
    "@xcite calculated @xmath3 and the spatial distribution of contact areas using a method that is restricted to the limit of zero poisson ratio .",
    "they found a substantial range where @xmath3 rose linearly with load , but did not test analytic results for the slope specifically .",
    "as in persson s work @xcite , their focus was on the change in results with increasing resolution of surface roughness .",
    "et al._@xcite have considered the scaling of contact area with load using a similar method .",
    "they find a slight deviation from linearity , but rule out larger deviations predicted by previous scaling arguments @xcite .    in this paper , we present numerical calculations of contact area and pressure distributions for a wide range of poisson ratios , loads , system sizes , self - affine scaling exponents and roughness amplitudes .",
    "we first show that @xmath3 has a well - defined thermodynamic limit , that is for fixed small scale roughness the fraction of area in contact at a given average normal pressure is independent of system size .",
    "the ratio of @xmath3 over load is shown to scale as the inverse of the rms surface slope , with a coefficient that lies between the results of bush _",
    "_ @xcite and persson @xcite .",
    "the dependence of @xmath10 on roughness exponent and poisson ratio is also obtained .",
    "this allows @xmath3 to be predicted for any elastic rough surface .",
    "we next describe the contact morphology and distribution of connected contact areas .",
    "the probability of finding a connected region of area @xmath0 falls off as a power law , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 depends only on roughness exponent @xmath13 .",
    "for @xmath14 , @xmath12 is greater than 2 , and the mean contact size is always comparable to the resolution of the calculation . as first noted by greenwood and williamson @xcite , the linear rise in @xmath3 with load reflects a linear increase in the number of contacts without any increase in their mean size or probability distribution .",
    "our results are contrasted to a common model where contacts form in the regions where undeformed surfaces would overlap .",
    "this approximation has been used to interpret optical images of contacts @xcite , and by greenwood and wu as a method of estimating the statistics of asperity sizes @xcite .",
    "we show that it gives much too large a total contact area , and a qualitatively different distribution of @xmath0 with @xmath15 .",
    "optical methods may include regions that are merely close to touching as part of the contact .",
    "we find that this can explain the observed discrepancy between experiment and calculation .",
    "the distribution of contact pressures @xmath16 is also studied .",
    "we find that results for all system sizes , roughness amplitudes , and roughness exponents collapse onto a universal curve when the pressure is normalized by its mean value",
    ". the mean value , @xmath6 , can be obtained from the roughness amplitude as described above .",
    "the distribution decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath16 , and has an exponential tail at large @xmath16 .",

    "possible connections to exponential stress distributions in jammed systems @xcite are mentioned .    in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the numerical procedures used to generate self - affine surfaces , mesh them , and determine their deformation using an explicit dynamic finite - element method . in section",
    "[ sec : result ] , we present numerical results from the contact analysis , including the contact area , contact morphology and pressure distribution .",
    "the final section presents conclusions from the current study and discusses avenues for future research .",
    "as in previous analytical and numerical calculations we use a well - known result from contact mechanics to simplify the geometry . if there is no friction or adhesion between two rough surfaces and the surface slope is small , then elastic contact between them can be mapped to contact between a single rough surface and a rigid flat plane@xcite .",
    "the effective modulus @xmath17 that controls the contact area is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the poisson ratios and young s moduli of the two surfaces .",
    "the height @xmath21 of the new rough surface is given by the difference between the local heights of the original undeformed surfaces .",
    "we consider the case where both of the surfaces have the same self - affine scaling properties but are uncorrelated .",
    "then the height @xmath21 has the same scaling properties , but with a larger amplitude .",
    "many surfaces have roughness on all length scales that can be described by self - affine fractal scaling . unlike self - similar fractals , self - affine fractal surfaces exhibit different scaling normal to the interface than along it .",
    "we consider geometries with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath22 plane and specify the surface by the height @xmath21 along the @xmath23-axis .",
    "for a self - affine surface , variations in the height over a lateral length scale @xmath24 rise as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is called the hurst or roughness exponent . since @xmath27",
    ", the surface looks smoother at larger length scales .",
    "many researchers also specify the scaling by an effective fractal dimension @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the spatial dimension .",
    "to generate three - dimensional self - affine fractal surfaces with rms roughness @xmath30 at small scales , we adopted the successive random midpoint algorithm of voss @xcite .",
    "the @xmath22 plane is divided into a uniform square grid with unit spacing and @xmath31 nodes along each axis . at the first step ,",
    "the center of the entire grid is displaced by a height chosen at random from a gaussian distribution of width @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the distance of the center from the corners .",
    "this center point then becomes one corner of new squares that are rotated by 45@xmath34 and have a new corner to center distance @xmath24 that is smaller by a factor of @xmath35 .",
    "the center of each new square is assigned a height equal to the average of the corner heights plus a random number chosen from a gaussian of width @xmath36 .",
    "this process is iterated down to @xmath37 , guaranteeing that the variation in height scales with @xmath24 in the appropriate manner .",
    "figure [ fig : surface ] shows a typical self - affine surface with @xmath38 .",
    "note that the height variation is enhanced by a factor of ten to make it visible in the figure .",
    "it is common to test the scaling properties of self - affine surfaces by calculating the fourier transform @xmath39 @xmath40 \\ \\",

    "the function @xmath39 should be isotropic and decay as @xmath45 .",
    "we have generated surfaces with @xmath13 between 0.3 and 0.9 and verified that the corresponding @xmath39 has the correct power law scaling .",
    "for a given @xmath30 , the values of @xmath39 at large @xmath46 are very insensitive to the random seed . however , there are large fluctuations at small @xmath46 where the roughness is dominated by the first few random numbers that are chosen at the largest length scales .",
    "these first random numbers also dominate the mean - squared height variation : @xmath47 and we find large variations in @xmath48 for surfaces with the same small scale roughness @xmath30 . as discussed below , the contact area is determined by @xmath30 and is relatively insensitive to fluctuations in @xmath48 .",
    "as noted above , numerical simulations are done for a rough elastic surface contacting a perfectly rigid flat surface .",
    "a typical finite element mesh is illustrated in figure [ fig : fem ] .",
    "the mesh is discretized with ten - node tetrahedral elements .",
    "these elements contain three integration points and quadratically interpolate the displacement field .",
    "a coarse mesh is used for the rigid surface to improve numerical efficiency . a fine mesh for the elastic surface",
    "is prepared in two stages .",
    "first , a fine mesh for a flat surface is obtained using a longest edge propagation path refinement scheme , which is ideally suited to obtain strong mesh gradations as well as preserving a high mesh quality @xcite .",
    "a cube of side @xmath49 is initially filled with a coarse mesh .",
    "each tetrahedral element at the outer surface is then divided to produce twice as many surface nodes and the mesh is refined .",
    "this process is repeated until surface nodes form a uniform square grid of unit spacing . using this technique ,",
    "meshes with @xmath31 up to @xmath50 are created .",
    "the resulting grid contains @xmath51 surface nodes , about @xmath52 total nodes and @xmath53 elements .",
    "next , the desired surface heights @xmath54 are imposed onto the contact surface . moving only the surface nodes produces badly distorted elements , that would at best require impractically small time steps and at worst produce negative jacobians .",
    "thus all nodes are moved by a fraction of the local height that depends on the initial height @xmath55 of the node above the bottom of the elastic cube ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fem ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of the change , @xmath56 , decreases to zero at the top of the cube so that the top surface remains flat .",
    "the specific form for the displacement is @xmath57 where @xmath58 usually gives good meshes .",
    "the goal is to determine the equilibrium contact geometry at a given load .",
    "an implicit approach is too memory intensive for the system sizes of interest .",
    "instead we use an explicit integration algorithm combined with a dynamic relaxation scheme .",
    "three different algorithms were compared to insure accuracy . in the first , the top surface is given a small velocity and its impact with the bottom surface is followed . in the second , the displacement of the nodes at the top of the elastic cube ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fem ] ) is incremented at a fixed rate or in small discrete steps . in the third , a constant force is applied to each of these nodes and gradually incremented . in the second and third algorithms kinetic energy",
    "is removed using the method described below .",
    "all three methods give equivalent results for the total area . unless otherwise noted , the results presented below were obtained with the third algorithm .",
    "we confirmed that the mean normal stress was independent of height to ensure that stress had equilibrated throughout the system .    within the lagrangian framework",
    ", the finite - element discretization of the field equations leads to a discrete system of equations : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the array of nodal coordinates , @xmath61 the mass matrix , @xmath62 the external force array , and @xmath63 the internal force array arising from the current state of stress .",
    "the second - order accurate central difference scheme is used to discretize eq .",
    "( [ linearmomentum ] ) in time @xcite .",
    "a small time step was used in order to be below the stability limit @xcite .",
    "the above equations conserve energy and will not converge to the static equilibrium configuration .",
    "optimum convergence is achieved by removing a fraction of the kinetic energy of each node at regular intervals .",
    "the characteristic time for stress equilibration across the elastic cube is given by the time @xmath64 for sound propagation across its height @xmath31 .",
    "equilibrium is reached in a few @xmath64 by scaling all velocities by a factor of 0.9 at intervals of @xmath65 .",
    "other procedures gave equivalent results , but with longer run times .",
    "the internal forces @xmath66 are calculated using a linear elastic isotropic constitutive law .",
    "all our results are expressed in dimensionless form by normalizing pressures by the effective modulus @xmath17 .",
    "the poisson ratio @xmath67 was varied from 0 to 0.45 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed at the contact surfaces to eliminate boundary effects .",
    "a contact algorithm is used only to enforce the impenetrability constraint on the two surfaces .",
    "adhesive and frictional forces are not considered in the current work .",
    "we adopt a conventional master / slave approach with a predictor / corrector split within the newmark time - stepping algorithm @xcite .",
    "the rough surface of the elastic cube is identified as slave while the rigid surface is master .",
    "the predictor part of the newmark algorithm neglects the contact constraints and , therefore , consists of an unconstrained step , with the result : @xmath68 this predictor solution needs to be corrected in order to comply with the impenetrability constraints .",
    "the net result of imposing these constraints is a set of self - equilibrated contact forces that modify the predictor positions and velocities .",
    "since the contact surfaces are presumed smooth , normals are well - defined and the surfaces can be unambiguously classified as master and slave .",
    "the final corrector configuration is therefore : @xmath69 here @xmath70 denotes the nodal mass , the superscript @xmath71 designates nodes that belong to the slave surface , and the vectors @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the normal and frictional forces , respectively .",
    "friction will not be taken into account in the remainder of the paper , but is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the formulation of an appropriate system of forces is obtained by considering a configuration in which a master surface triangle ( facet of a tetrahedral finite element ) is penetrated by several slave nodes . for",
    "each of the penetrating slave nodes , let @xmath74 be the normal depth of penetration to be corrected by the contact forces .",
    "the contact constraints determine a local problem with the normal slave force as an unknown , which is obtained as a direct function of the penetration @xmath74 and the master normal , @xmath75 : @xmath76      the contact algorithm just described identifies all slave nodes on the top surface that attempt to penetrate the flat bottom surface .",
    "we obtain the total contact area by multiplying the number of penetrating nodes @xmath77 by the area of the square associated with each node . in most cases",
    "we report the fractional area @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the total number of surface nodes .    in principle ,",
    "the area associated with each node varies with normal load if the poisson ratio is non - zero .",
    "however , tests using a voronoi tessellation to determine the area for each node gave equivalent results for the relatively smooth surfaces considered here .",
    "a voronoi approach becomes important for rougher surfaces or irregular grids .",
    "a more fundamental ambiguity in the contact area comes from the fact that contacts ( fig . [",

    "dieterich and kilgore s optical method identifies any region where the surfaces are closer than some fraction of the wavelength as in contact .",
    "due to the fractal nature of contacts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : contact ] ) this may overestimate the true area . at the atomic scale , contact is difficult to define . if one associates contact with a finite interaction , then @xmath84 would always be unity since the van der waals interactions between surfaces extend to arbitrary distances .",
    "a more practical definition is to associate contact with the separation at which the net interaction becomes strongly repulsive due to the overlap of electrons on opposing surfaces .",
    "this leads to a range of separations where surfaces are in contact . as in the optical measurements ,",
    "the contact area can be greatly enhanced relative to the penetration definition used here .",
    "direct comparisons to atomistic models will be presented in another paper @xcite .",
    "as noted in the introduction , analytic theories of contact between self - affine surfaces predict that the real area of contact @xmath3 should be proportional to the applied load @xmath5 at small loads @xcite . to make the load dimensionless we normalize it by @xmath4 times the effective modulus @xmath17 .",
    "figure [ fig : linear ] shows a plot of the fraction of the projected area that is in contact @xmath84 as a function of the normalized load for a system with @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath80 . as expected , the area is proportional to the load at small loads .",

    "the small variation between curves is comparable to that between different random surfaces of the same size . in each case @xmath90",
    "is nearly constant when from 1 to 8% of the surface is in contact .",
    "this implies that the mean pressure in contacting regions @xmath92 is also constant .",
    "the ratio @xmath93 drops as @xmath84 increases further because @xmath84 is bounded by unity while the normalized load keeps increasing .",
    "the ratio has roughly halved by @xmath94% .",
    "most of the analytic theories mentioned above explicitly assume that there is a statistically significant number of asperities in contact , and that only the tops of asperities are in contact .",
    "the latter assumption breaks down as @xmath84 approaches unity , contributing to the decrease at large @xmath84 in fig .",
