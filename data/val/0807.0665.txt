    "it has long been suggested that the singularities in general relativity signal a breakdown of the classical theory and should be resolved by the quantum effects of gravity .",
    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) is one of such candidate theories of quantum gravity and its application to cosmological models is known as loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the comprehensive formulation for lqc has been constructed in detail in the spatially flat and isotropic model with a free massless scalar field @xcite , showing that the quantum evolution is deterministic across the deep planck regime and the cosmological singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce for the states which are semiclassical at late times .",
    "this construction was extended to @xmath0 friedmann - robertson - walker models to include intrinsic curvature @xcite as well as bianchi i models to include anisotropy @xcite , affirming the resolution of cosmological singularities and the occurrence of quantum bounces , either in the fundamental quantum theory of lqc or at the level of phenomenological dynamics .    to further extend this formulation and enlarge its domain of validity ,",
    "the next step is to investigate loop quantum geometry of the black hole and to see whether the black hole singularity is also resolved .",
    "the simplest step is to consider the interior of a schwarzschild black hole , in which the temporal and radial coordinates flip roles and thus the metric components are homogeneous with the kantowski - sachs symmetry .",
    "thanks to homogeneity , the loop quantization of the schwarzschild interior can be formulated as a minisuperspace model in a similar fashion to lqc . this has been developed in @xcite and its phenomenological dynamics studied in @xcite shows that the black hole interior is extended to a white hole interior through the bounce , which resolves the singularity .",
    "the analysis in @xcite is based on the original quantization strategy ( referred to as the `` @xmath1-scheme '' in this paper ) used in @xcite , which , as a direct transcription of the original lqc construction in @xcite , introduces a fixed parameter to impose fundamental discreteness of quantum geometry .",
    "however , it has been argued that the @xmath1-scheme quantization in lqc leads to a wrong semiclassical limit in some regimes and should be improved by replacing the discreteness parameters with adaptive variables which depend on the scale factors @xcite .",
    "two improved strategies ( called `` @xmath2-scheme '' and `` @xmath3-scheme '' in this paper ) for loop quantization of the schwarzschild interior were investigated in @xcite at the level of phenomenological dynamics .",
    "however , the results of @xcite are not easily compared with the bouncing scenario of lqc as some details are still missing .",
    "for instance , the exact condition for the occurrence of the bounce has yet to be pinpointed . to have a better understanding of the extended schwarzschild solution",
    ", more effort is needed to investigate the quantum corrections on the horizon and the evolution of the parameters ( e.g. , mass of the black hole ) that characterize different classical phases across the quantum bounce .    in order to bridge the gap between the loop quantum dynamics of cosmological models and that of schwarzschild black holes , a cosmological model of kantowski - sachs spacetime with a massless scalar field has been studied in @xcite at the level of phenomenological dynamics .",
    "the study of @xcite not only sets a new cosmological model of lqc with inclusion of both intrinsic curvature and anisotropy but also facilitates a methodology to study the details of loop quantum geometry of the schwarzschild interior . by exploiting the methods introduced in @xcite ,",
    "we are able to articulate the geometrical interpretation of the extended schwarzschild solution and refine some observations obtained in @xcite .    based on the same semiclassical approach of @xcite to incorporate loop quantum corrections , the phenomenological dynamics of the schwarzschild interior",
    "is investigated in this paper with two improved quantization strategies ( @xmath2- and @xmath3-schemes ) . in the @xmath2-scheme ,",
    "the classical singularity is resolved and replaced by the quantum bounce , which bridges the black hole interior with the interior of a white hole . on the other hand , in the @xmath3-scheme ,",
    "the classical black hole singularity is resolved and the event horizon is diffused by the quantum bounce , across which , the classical black hole gives birth to a baby black hole with a decreased mass in the consecutive classical cycle .",
    "this lineage continues , giving the extended spacetime `` fractal '' structure , until eventually the triad variable @xmath4 grows exponentially while the other triad variable @xmath5 descends into a deep planck regime , signaling a breakdown of the semiclassical description .",
    "as in the hamiltonian framework for homogeneous models , we have to restrict the spatial integration to a finite sized shell @xmath6 to make the hamiltonian finite .",
    "this prescription raises the question whether the resulting dynamics is independent of the choice of @xmath7 .",
    "it can be shown that the phenomenological dynamics in the @xmath3-scheme is completely independent of the choice of @xmath7 as is the classical dynamics , while the phenomenological dynamics in the @xmath2-scheme reacts to @xmath7 and thus , in the language of the `` no - hair '' theorem , one extra parameter ( mass of the conjoined white hole ) is required to completely characterize the extended schwarzschild solution .",
    "in addition to the issues related to the dependence on @xmath7 , the phenomenological dynamics also reveals interesting scaling symmetry , which is suggestive that the fundamental scale ( area gap ) imposed for the spatial geometry may give rise to a fundamental scale in temporal measurement .",

    "this implies that in the @xmath2-scheme the choice of @xmath7 has a physical consequence , and in the language of the no - hair theorem , one extra parameter ( @xmath136 or @xmath55 ) is required to completely characterize the extended schwarzschild solution . in the @xmath3-scheme , by contrast , the choice of @xmath7 is physically irrelevant , and the no - hair theorem holds the same .    additionally , the classical dynamics also admits the symmetries given by [ eqn : symmetry 2 ] & & , + & & , + p_b ,  p_c & & ^2p_b ,  ^2p_c , + b ,  c & & b ,  c , + k_c&&^2 k_c , + m & & m. the scaling symmetry regarding @xmath207 is expected , since the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath27 has no effect on the classical dynamics .",

    "this alternative scaling does not work in the case of kantowski - sachs spacetime , since it violates the hamiltonian constraint ( [ eqn : cl rescaled hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "that is to say , the presence of the spatial curvature [ i.e. , the @xmath211 term in the bracket in ( [ eqn : cl rescaled hamiltonian ] ) ] ties the temporal scale with the spatial scale ; as a result , only the scaling @xmath212 ( with gives the spatial direction the same scaling as in the temporal direction ) with @xmath213 preserves the symmetry .",
    "] however , very surprisingly , the scaling symmetry involving @xmath208 is violated for both the @xmath2-scheme and the @xmath3-scheme phenomenological dynamics .",
    "curiously , this symmetry is restored if @xmath208 is accompanied by @xmath214 and one extra scaling is also imposed at the same time : [ eqn : symmetry 2 ] ^-2 ^ 2 .",
    "this intriguing observation seems to suggest , albeit speculatively , that in the context of quantum gravity the fundamental scale ( area gap ) in spatial geometry gives rise to a temporal scale via the nonlocality of quantum gravity ( i.e. , using holonomies ) and the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath27 somehow plays the role bridging the scalings in time and space .",
    "[ this reminds us that , in lqg , the precise value of the area gap @xmath112 is proportional to @xmath27 , and @xmath27 is also the parameter which relates the _ intrinsic _ geometry ( encoded by spin connection @xmath215 ) with the _ extrinsic _ curvature ( @xmath216 ) via @xmath217 .",
    "] moreover , taking ( [ eqn : symmetry 2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : symmetry 2 ] ) into ( [ eqn : qm precise effective mass ] ) , we also have .",
    "the above observations for scaling symmetry draw close parallels to those in @xcite and @xcite for the phenomenological dynamics of lqc in the bianchi i and kantowski - sachs models . because of the absence of matter content , however , some implications thereof are missing here ; particularly , the occurrence of bounces is no longer indicated by the ( directional ) matter energy density .",
    "nevertheless , if we define `` energy density '' @xmath218 and `` directional densities '' @xmath219 , @xmath220 as [ eqn : energy density ] : = , _ b:= , _ c:= , then according to ( [ eqn : qm bounce for pc ] ) , ( [ eqn : qm bounce for pb ] ) , ( [ eqn : qm bounce for pc ] ) and ( [ eqn : qm bounce for pb ] ) , the bounces can still be said to take place whenever `` energy density '' or `` directional density '' approaches the planckian density @xmath221 ( up to a numerical factor ) .",
    "this not only paraphrases the condition of bounce occurrence in a universal form as ( generalized ) energy density being the indicator for the bounce but also suggests that we should put the anisotropic shear on the equal footing as matter content and take into account the energy density arising from it . and @xmath131 characterize anisotropic shear and the hamiltonian constraint can be understood as the relation which relates anisotropy with spatial curvature ( and matter energy if any ) .",
    "moreover , it has been shown in appendix b of @xcite that the anisotropic shear behaves as a kind of anisotropic matter : the quantities defined in ( [ eqn : energy density ] ) can be considered as the `` energy density of the classical anisotropic shear '' ( portioned to the specific direction ) . ]",
    "from this perspective , the ideas of relational interpretation of quantum mechanics remarked in @xcite can be carried over even without matter content .",
    "unfortunately , all the scaling symmetries break down in the detailed construction for the quantum geometry of the schwarzschild interior .",
    "the fundamental quantum theory only respects the scaling symmetries at the leading order .",
    "this is due to the fact that the quantum evolution in the fundamental theory is governed by a difference equation , in which the step size of difference introduces an additional scale in the deep planck regime @xcite .",
    "in fact , already in the level of phenomenological dynamics , the scaling symmetries are violated if we further take into account the loop quantum corrections on the cotriad component @xmath103 . for the fundamental quantum theory ,",

    "by contrast , the phenomenological dynamics in the @xmath3-scheme is completely independent of @xmath7 as is the classical dynamics and the no - hair theorem remains unchanged .",
    "in addition to the symmetry related to the choice of @xmath7 , both schemes admit additional symmetries of scaling , which are suggestive that the fundamental scale ( area gap ) in spatial geometry may give rise to a fundamental scale in temporal measurement .",
    "these symmetries , however , break down in the construction for the fundamental quantum theory .",
    "while the @xmath3-scheme has the advantage that its phenomenological dynamics is independent of @xmath7 , the fundamental quantum theory of the schwarzschild interior based on the @xmath3-scheme is difficult to construct .",
    "both the @xmath2- and @xmath3-schemes have desirable merits and it is still disputable which one ( or yet another possibility ) is more faithful to implement the underlying physics of loop quantum geometry .",
    "this issue is in the same status as that in the bianchi i @xcite and kantowsi - sachs @xcite cosmological models .",
    "hopefully , the detailed investigations in this paper on both schemes would help elucidate this issue . however",

    "it would be worthwhile to extend the previous work to the improved ( @xmath2- or @xmath3- ) scheme and compare the results with those obtained here .",
    "meanwhile , it has been suggested @xcite and recently analyzed in detail for 2-dimensional black holes @xcite that quantum geometry effects may provide a possible mechanism for recovery of information that is classically lost in the process of hawking evaporation , primarily because the black hole singularity is resolved and consequently the quantum spacetime is sufficiently larger than the classical counterpart .",
    "it would be very instructive to study the information paradox in the context of loop quantum geometry of the schwarzschild black hole , as both resolution of the classical singularity and augmentation of spacetime have been observed at the level of phenomenological dynamics .",
    "additionally , in the @xmath3-scheme , the quantum effects not only resolve the singularity but also modify the event horizon . the fact that the event horizon is diffused may have an impact on the hawking evaporation process .",
    "however , the homogeneous framework used on this paper only allows us to study the interior of the black hole and it is unclear how exactly the horizon is diffused and pieced together with the exterior ( region i or iv in fig .",
    "[ fig : penrose diagrams ] ) . in order to extend the results to cover the whole spacetime , the next step would be to apply the techniques described here to the inhomogeneous formulation of spherically symmetric loop quantum geometry such as developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this in turn could enable us to study the collapsing scenario of loop quantum black holes .",
    "one of the virtues of the improved strategy ( @xmath2- or @xmath3-scheme ) in both the isotropic and bianchi i models of lqc is to fix the serious drawback in the original strategy ( @xmath1-scheme ) , whereby the critical value of matter density @xmath223 ( in the isotropic model ) or of directional densities @xmath224 ( in the bianchi i model ) at which the bounce occurs can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the momentum @xmath225 of the matter field , thereby giving the wrong semiclassical behavior @xcite . in the case of the schwarzschild interior , without the reference of matter content , it is not clear whether the @xmath1-scheme is problematic in regard to semiclassicality . for comparison ,",

    "to get an idea where the quantum corrections become appreciable , employing the classical solution given by ( [ eqn : cl sol of kb ] ) , ( [ eqn : cl sol of pc ] ) and ( [ eqn : cl sol of pb ] ) , we estimate the quantities @xmath230 and @xmath231 : ^o_bb & = & ^o_b \\ {          .",
    "this suggests that the quantum corrections are significant near the classical singularity and negligible on the horizon provided that [ eqn : qm0 reg ] k_c , which can always be satisfied if we choose @xmath7 small enough for a given @xmath73 .",
    "the equations of motion are given by the hamiltonian constraint @xmath232 and hamilton s equations : [ eqn : qm0 eom 3 ] & = & \\{c , h__o}=2 g = -2 ^ -1p_b , + [ eqn : qm0 eom 4 ] & = & \\{p_c , h__o}=-2 g = 2 ^ -1p_bp_c(^o_cc ) , + [ eqn : qm0 eom 5 ] & = & \\{b , h__o}=g = -^-1p_c -^-1p_b^2 -p_b , + [ eqn : qm0 eom 6 ] & = & \\{p_b , h__o}=-g = ^-1p_b(^o_bb ) , which follow [ eqn : qm0 dkc / dt ] = 0 p_c = k_c and [ eqn : qm0 dkb / dt ] p_c=:k_b^o(t ) , = -^2p_b^2(^o_bb ) .",
