    "although orbits of stars or interstellar matter ( ism ) on galactic planes are fundamental in studying galactic dynamics , accurate shapes of these in real galaxies are difficult to discern because two - dimensional motion can hardly be observed .",
    "observations of line emission give only the line - of - sight velocities of the ism in spiral galaxies .",
    "hence , we often discuss galactic dynamics assuming that the ism motion is circular , since the velocity fields of galaxies often show so - called spider diagrams , which can be reproduced by circular rotation around their galactic centers . obtained rotation curves",
    "provide mass distributions in spiral galaxies ( sofue et al .",
    "1999 , 2003a ) .",
    "barred galaxies , however , show strong noncircular motions , and approximations of circular orbits fail . for these galaxies ,",
    "the computer simulation of ism dynamics has played an important role in studying galactic dynamics , and many models have reproduced observations fairly well ( huntley 1978 ; wada et al .",
    "1998 ) . however , the link between simulations and observations is generally difficult , since there are many unidentified parameters , such as rotation curve , bar strength , pattern speed , viscosity , etc .",
    "and although the shape of a galactic bar is often expressed in the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 denote galactic radius , integer , and the angle around the galactic center , respectively , it has not been determined by observations .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to determine two - dimensional ism motions on the galactic plane directly from observations in order to model real galaxies .",
    "while kuno & nakai ( 1997 ) inferred an ism orbit by tracing the velocity vectors at the spiral phase using the co data of m51 and found that the orbit deviates greatly from a purely circular motion , there are few galaxies for which two - dimensional orbits have been derived from observational data .    in order to trace two - dimensional motion in a galactic disk",
    "we need four values , two of which are of position and two of which are of velocity .",
    "both position components are directly given by observation .",
    "a velocity component perpendicular to the line of sight can not be determined , although the line - of - sight component is given by observations .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a method for determining the two - dimensional orbits of ism on galactic planes directly from observations on the basis of simple assumptions .",
    "we applied this method to model velocity fields to confirm that it works well .",
    "we then applied this method to a real galaxy , ngc 4569 , for which @xmath4co(@xmath5 ) data has been obtained with nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) observations .",
    "when the potential of the galactic disk is considered to be dominated by an axisymmetric component and bar or spiral components are small enough , the force acting on the ism is directed approximately centripetally and the angular momentum is nearly constant . in this section ,",
    "we describe a method for determining an ism orbit on a galactic plane based on the assumptions that ( 1 ) the angular momentum is conserved along an orbit , ( 2 ) all orbits are closed in a single rotating frame , and ( 3 ) the system is symmetric through the origin .",
    "we choose a cartesian coordinate whose ( @xmath6)-plane coincides with a galactic plane . in viewing the galaxy face - on , we let the @xmath7- and @xmath8-axes coincide with the major and minor axes of the disk , respectively .",
    "the galactic center is located at ( @xmath6 ) = ( 0,0 ) .",
    "the velocity components parallel to the @xmath7- and @xmath8-axes are denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "when the galactic disk is inclined by @xmath11 , the projected coordinate is defined by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the observable line - of - sight velocity corresponds to @xmath15 .",
    "while three components @xmath20 are known from observation with the inclination @xmath11 , one component , @xmath9 , is unknown .",
    "let a galaxy rotate counterclockwise and the lower side of the disk ( @xmath21 ) be near us .",
    "first , we choose two points on the major axis so that they are symmetric with respect to the galactic center ; these points are defined as @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the superscript denotes a quadrant of position ; 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 mean the first , second , third , and fourth quadrants , respectively .",
    "the subscript represents position ; 0 denotes an initial point and 1 denotes a neighboring point .",
    "here we mainly think of two trajectories in the first and the second quadrants , that is , @xmath24 .",
    "we omit a superscript when we do not specify the quadrant .",
    "the velocities @xmath25 and @xmath26 at these points are determined from observation .",
    "we set @xmath27 by averaging the observational data at two points in order to reduce observational errors .",
    "we suppose that one orbit crosses these two points and that the angular momentum , @xmath28 , is constant along this orbit . since the angular momentum in the cartesian coordinate is @xmath29 and @xmath30 along the major axis , the angular momentum along this orbit is determined uniquely as @xmath31 . since @xmath10 at each point",
    "@xmath32 is given by observation , @xmath9 can be estimated to be @xmath33 at each point .",
    "second , we set the velocity @xmath34 to be @xmath35 at @xmath36 using a free parameter , @xmath37 .",
    "then a neighboring point @xmath38 is determined in the vector form approximately by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote position and velocity vectors , respectively .",
    "the vector @xmath42 is the pattern speed , whose absolute value is proportional to the radius and whose direction is always tangential to the position vector .",
    "the constant @xmath43 is the time interval .",
    "this equation is a formula of the euler method for solving a differential equation numerically .",
    "the time interval @xmath43 is chosen so that each subsequent point is separated from the initial point by half the spatial resolution of the observation , based on the nyquist sampling .",
    "we allow @xmath43 to take a negative value ; positive and negative @xmath43 correspond to trajectories traveling counterclockwise and clockwise from the initial points .",
    "two trajectories , therefore , start from one initial point .",
    "the vector component @xmath44 at the next position @xmath38 can be determined by observation , and the other component , @xmath45 , may be estimated by the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "we calculate an orbit in the first quadrant simultaneously with the third quadrant , which is the same as in the second and fourth quadrants . then , to reduce the observational noises , we average velocity components @xmath10 at symmetric points relative to @xmath46 every calculation step ; for example , @xmath47 .",
    "if data is lacking at the next point , we define the value at this point to be the same as that of the previous ; @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is any integer .",
    "we repeat this process until an orbit reaches @xmath50 . for the next stage ,",
    "we vary a parameter @xmath37 by @xmath51 , which was taken to be @xmath52 in this paper , so that orbits from @xmath53 meet one another at @xmath50 .",
    "we avoid a solution whereby a radius of the orbit becomes extremely large , @xmath54 . in this paper",
    "we adopted @xmath55 .",
    "figure 1 presents a flow chart and a scheme for this method .",
    "although we explain our method by using the euler method for simplicity , we actually use a fourth - order runge - kutta method to calculate orbits more accurately .    ",
    "in this paper we applied this method to ngc 4569 @xmath4co(@xmath5 ) data , which was taken from the high - resolution virgo co survey ( sofue et al .",
    "the adopted parameters and observational parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "the inclination and position angles were determined by applying an elliptical fitting to a k - band image ( jarrett et al .",
    "2003 ) using the task ellipse in the iraf stsdas software .",
    "the position angle steeply decreases toward the center within @xmath56 , which reminds us of a central bar .",
    "the position angle largely increases outward beyond @xmath57 , which reminds us of a warping of the stellar disk . in order to avoid these effects , we estimated inclination and position angles by averaging them between @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    ". consequently , we obtained the position angle @xmath60 and the axial ratio @xmath61 , which yields an inclination of @xmath62 ; , according to the equation of tully ( 1988 ) , @xmath63{(q^2 - 0.2 ^ 2)/(1 - 0.2 ^ 2)}.\\ ] ] ngc 4569 shows an s - shaped velocity field , which indicates the clear existence of noncircular motion because the isovelocity contour of the systemic velocity is not parallel to the minor axis at all . the digitized sky survey ( dss ) @xmath64-band and co images of this galaxy are shown in figures 2a and 2b .",
    "the contours in figure 2b represent the velocity field .    according to tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 )",
    ", the pattern speed can be estimated by using the intensity - weighted line - of - sight velocity and the position of the major axis based on the equation of continuity .",
    "we applied this method to this galaxy using the @xmath65-band image and the co velocity field .",
    "the intensity at the center is quite large , which reminds us of nuclear activity and does not seem to satisfy the equation of continuity .",
    "therefore , we estimated the pattern speed in the range @xmath66 and obtained a pattern speed of 74 km s@xmath67 kpc@xmath67 .",
    "note that this value is tentative , since gaseous velocity does not always coincide with the stellar velocity .    ",
    "table 1      figure 2       we applied our method to this galaxy to determine orbits on the galactic planes . for ngc 4569 , we fixed the step of calculation at @xmath68 , which is half of the beam size .",
    "we calculated less than 12 orbits that cross the points @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is an integer , on the major axis .",
    "we show the resultant orbits viewed face - on in figure 2c .",
    "we imposed these orbits on the co image , which is shown in figure 2d . in ngc 4569",
    ", orbits tends to be strongly elongated in the direction of the major axis .",
    "the axes of the orbits are slightly inclined in the counterclockwise direction from the major axis .",
    "this large deviation from circular orbits causes the strong disturbance in the velocity field .    since the estimated pattern speed is tentative , we calculated orbits taking other pattern speeds ( 34 , 54 , and 94 km s@xmath67 kpc@xmath67 ) to find how the resultant orbits depend on the pattern speed .",
    "results are shown in figure 3 .",
    "fewer orbits can be obtained when a larger pattern speed is adopted . in any case ,",
    "resultant orbits are strongly elongated in the direction of the major axis and are inclined in the clockwise direction from the major axis .",
    " figure 3     since characterizing the presence of noncircular motions is sensitive to the values of inclination and position angle adopted ( schoenmakers et al .",
    "1997 ) , we calculated orbits taking other inclinations and position angles that differ by @xmath71 from @xmath62 and @xmath72 .",
    "results are shown in figure 4 .",
    "only a few orbits can be obtained for some adopted inclinations and position angles . in these cases also , resultant orbits are elongated and are inclined in the counterclockwise direction .     figure 4     while some orbits seem to cross others slightly , the gas orbits should not cross each other , otherwise the gasses would collide , shock , and lose angular momentum . since the amplitude of the orbits intersections is less than beam size , these intersections are thought to be due to a calculation error .",
    "below we have applied our method to model velocity fields in order to confirm that it works properly and to estimate errors .",
    "consequently , we conclude that our calculation works well within a beam size and that the calculation gives the best solution when we adopt a half beam size or a beam size as a step size .",
    "first , we made a simple model in which each orbit is an ellipse whose axial ratio is 2 and the position angle of each orbit is the same as the others .",
    "the velocity at the major axis is fixed at 200 km s@xmath67 , and the angular momentum is thought to be constant along each orbit .",
    "the inclination of the disk is fixed at @xmath73 .",
    "the velocity field is given in an infinite resolution .",
    "when step sizes of @xmath74 and @xmath75 are adopted , typical deviations from the correct orbits are less than 1/20 of a step size .",
    "we conclude that the calculation works well for this ideal case .",
    "next , for a more complicated case , we made a model in which each orbit is an ellipse whose axial ratio is 2 and the position angle of each orbit increases with radius ; the semimajor radius is @xmath76 ( @xmath70 being an integer ) , and the position angle increases by @xmath77 when the semimajor radius increases by @xmath78 .",
    "angular momentum is constant along each orbit .",
    "the inclination of the disk is fixed at @xmath73 .",
    "velocity fields are given by smoothing with a gaussian whose full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) is @xmath79 on the basis of a typical beam size of the nma virgo co survey .",
    "we calculated orbits with various step sizes .",
    "an averaged deviation between @xmath80 and @xmath81 gets the smallest value , @xmath82 , when we adopt a beam size as a step size .",
    "it is not precise to assume that angular momentum is constant along an orbit in a field in which the gravitational force is not always centripetal . to see the effect of the variation of angular momentum along an orbit",
    ", we applied our method to a model of orbits in a weak bar potential .",
    "we took a model from wada ( 1994 ) .",
    "we chose a bar strength @xmath83 and a damping rate @xmath84 .",
    "the angular momentum varies by @xmath85 .",
    "we assume that the rotational velocity reaches a maximum of 203 km s@xmath67 at a radius of 1.6 kpc .",
    "the pattern speed , @xmath86 , is fixed at 70 km s@xmath67 kpc@xmath67 .",
    "the distance is taken to be 16.1 mpc , which is the distance to the virgo cluster .",
    "the averaged deviation is minimized at @xmath87 when we adopt a step size equal to a half of the beam size .",
    "if the angular momentum varies by @xmath88 , a velocity vector has an error of @xmath88 at maximum .",
    "when we fixed the step size at half a beam size , the position error of the orbit is @xmath88 of half a beam size at maximum for each step .",
    "an error due to the assumption of a constant angular momentum would not be negligible when the step number is large .",
    "we found that deviation is the smallest when the step size is fixed at a beam size or a half beam size .",
    "this is interpreted as follows : the deviation grows as the step number increases . on the other hand , the smaller the step size is , the more accurately the runge - kutta integrator works .",
    "since the observed data are smeared with the beam size , we can not get information for a scale smaller than the beam size . when the step size is smaller than the beam size , the calculation error only increases .",
    "therefore , the step number and step size should be as small as possible and the step size should not be much smaller than the beam size in order to reduce the error .",
    "consequently , the deviation is the smallest when we adopt a beam size or half a beam size as the step size .      in order to investigate the dependency on the adopted pattern speed , we applied our method to model 3 , assuming incorrect pattern speeds of 30 , 50 , and 90 km s@xmath67 kpc@xmath67 .",
    "the averaged deviations are @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "the deviation increases for an incorrect pattern speed .",
    "the averaged deviation is , however , smaller than the beam size for this model .",
    "one of the most useful applications of our method is to determine the mass distribution in a spiral galaxy even if the rotation curve can not be obtained because of strong noncircular motion .",
    "following binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) , we introduce a frame rotating at @xmath91 and effective potential @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a potential in a rest frame and @xmath1 is a radius . in this frame ,",
    "the equation of motion becomes @xmath94 here the acceleration @xmath95 is known from the resultant orbits and two - dimensional velocity vectors .",
    "a mass density can be calculated according to the poisson equation @xmath96    we found that the gravitational vector is oriented to the galactic center within @xmath97 by calculating it from the obtained orbits .",
    "therefore , the potential is nearly spherical and is expressed as @xmath98 with a function of only radius @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , we assumed @xmath100 in order to calculate the mass distribution in ngc 4569 using our result .",
    "we calculated the mass distribution with pattern speeds of 34 , 54 , 74 , and 94 km s@xmath67 kpc@xmath67 .",
    "figure 5 shows the mass distribution on the galactic plane of ngc 4569 . in this paper",
    ", we calculated mass densities inside the largest obtained orbits .",
    "ngc 4569 shows an elongated distribution which is inclined in the counterclockwise direction from the major axis . the mass distribution near the borderlines is disturbed because there are not many data points to calculate .",
    "a typical error arising from a 10.4 km s@xmath67 error in the line - of - sight velocity is 5.7 @xmath101 pc@xmath102 when we suppose ( 1 ) a velocity vector to be parallel with @xmath8-axis ; ( 2 ) an error in a gradient of the potential to be @xmath103 ; and ( 3 ) an error in mass density to be @xmath104 . here",
    ", we adopt @xmath105 km s@xmath67 , @xmath106 km s@xmath67 kpc@xmath67 , @xmath107 km s@xmath67 , and @xmath108 pc .     figure 5 ",
    "we presented the ism orbits as being approximately determined in assuming that ( 1 ) the angular momentum is conserved along each orbit , ( 2 ) all orbits are closed in a single rotating frame , and ( 3 ) the system is symmetric through the origin . our method is useful for modeling a real galaxy because it is calculated directly from observational data .",
    "however , we must note the following points : first , our method is plausible for a potential that is dominated by an axisymmetric component and in which the loss of angular momentum due to the shock of the gas is negligible . otherwise , the angular momentum is not conserved and our method fails .",
    "second , this method can not be applied to a patchy velocity field .",
    "third , this method can not work at the corotation radius where the rotational velocity is equal to the pattern speed .",
    "fourth , resultant orbits can deviate by observational resolution .",
