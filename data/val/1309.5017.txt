    "the successful treatment of a physical problem often rests on the right choice of formalism , and conceptual progress is hard if one uses an inappropriate language .",
    "this is particularly evident in quantum theory , where diverging , yet equivalent formalisms come along with inherent advantages and disadvantages . for good reasons , the hydrogen atom is usually quantized by means of schrdinger s wave equation , while fields are naturally described by heisenberg operators .",
    "feynman s path integral formulation , on the other hand , is often preferred in semiclassical contexts , and vast perturbative expansions are best handled diagrammatically .",
    "it is clearly useful to command a variety of alternative methods for treating a given physical system .",

    "moyal completed it @xcite by discovering that wigner s one - to - one mapping between quantum operators and functions on a classical phase space reflects weyl s correspondence rule @xcite .",
    "this picture has found numerous applications in many areas of physics , ranging from solid - state physics to quantum optics @xcite , from particle interferometry to molecular physics @xcite , and from semiclassics to the foundations of quantum mechanics @xcite ; it has even been adapted to quantum field theory @xcite .    in this article",
    "we generalize the standard cartesian wigner - weyl - moyal formalism to general curved configuration spaces .",
    "it applies to highly symmetric surfaces such as spheres or paraboloids , but also to arbitrary manifolds without any symmetry constraints .",
    "all the characteristic features of the cartesian case carry over . along with the interpretation of the wigner function as a quasiprobability distribution ,",
    "these include the replacement of operator traces by phase - space integrals and a meaningful semiclassical limit .",
    "as we demonstrate , the phase - space coordinates must be constructed from canonically conjugate operator pairs .",
    "the associated translation operators are used to define the stratonovich - weyl operator kernels , which lie at the heart of the wigner - weyl - moyal formalism @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the formalism is consistently based on the group of translations , independent of whether these reflect an isometry of the manifold or whether competing dynamical symmetry groups are present .",

    "it does provide by construction an unambiguous partitioning into mutually independent pairs of phase space variables , reflected by the classical canonical poisson brackets @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this guarantees that the resulting phase space representation behaves in correspondence to its classical counterpart , as in the cartesian case .",
    "we then find that any weyl - ordered observable is mapped to its equivalent function on phase space , that integrating out phase space coordinates yields the marginal probability distribution , and that the motion of the wigner function is described by a quantum liouville equation , which turns into its classical equivalent as @xmath4 .",
    "various attempts to generalize the cartesian wigner function considered highly symmetric manifolds , in particular homogeneously curved spaces such as spheres @xcite .",

    "all the relevant properties of the standard wigner function have so far been demonstrated only for the one - dimensional case of a single angle - angular momentum pair , which is a curvature - free problem @xcite , and for the orientation state of a rigid body @xcite , which is an instance of the general theory presented in this article .    many physical systems exhibit compact configuration spaces .",
    "simple examples are the one - dimensional motion of a point particle constrained to a circle , or the two - dimensional motion of a particle confined to the surface of a sphere .",
    "underlying symmetry groups are then compact , with discrete , finite - dimensional irreducible representations .",
    "likewise , the canonically conjugate momentum operators generating coordinate translations then exhibit discrete spectra .",
    "this is a consequence of the compactness and is not directly related to the curvature of the configuration space .",
    "we demonstrate how the presented phase space formalism is applied to configuration spaces implying discrete momentum spectra .",
    "this article is structured as follows : in section [ section : cartesian_wigner_function ] we recapitulate the wigner - weyl - moyal representation for the cartesian case and briefly demonstrate how to construct it from stratonovich - weyl operator kernels . quantum mechanics in curved configuration spaces is introduced in section [ section : quantum_mechanics_on_curved_configuration_spaces ] , and we provide in section [ section : curved_space_wigner_function ] the corresponding phase space description . in section [ section : extended_two - dimensional_curved_spaces ] we illustrate the presented wigner - weyl - moyal formalism by means of two - dimensional curved surfaces embedded in three - dimensional euclidean space . section [ section : free_particle_on_a_sphere ] then elaborates the formalism for compact configuration spaces , demonstrating it for a point particle constrained to the surface of a sphere .",
