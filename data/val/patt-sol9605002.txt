    "parametrically excited surface waves , or faraday waves , are generated when a container of fluid is vertically vibrated . above an acceleration threshold , waves appear on the fluid surface .",
    "the waves vibrate at half the driving frequency , a feature associated with the parametric resonance that is responsible for pumping energy into the surface - wave modes .    in most `` faraday experiments , ''",
    "the container is driven sinusoidally .",
    "that is , its vertical position may be described by @xmath0 , and its acceleration by @xmath1 . in this paper",
    ", we explore the consequences of driving the container with a triangle - wave forcing .",
    "although the difference between the two waveforms matters little physically , we shall show that it simplifies the analysis remarkably .",
    "there are two broad motivations for our study .",
    "first , although the theory of hydrodynamic stability occupies an important conceptual place in current courses in hydrodynamics , standard examples such as thermal convection ( rayleigh - bnard convection , or rbc ) and shear flow between rotating concentric cylinders ( taylor - vortex flow , or tvf ) are too complicated to present in standard undergraduate courses .",
    "textbooks for such courses ( e.g. , @xcite ) usually limit themselves to heuristic arguments .",
    "by contrast , our analysis is simple enough to present in a single class to third- or fourth - year students .",
    "( the calculation s difficulty is equivalent to solving the kronig - penney model for energy bands in a one - dimensional solid .",
    "this example is commonly presented in undergraduate solid - state - physics courses . )",
    "a second motivation comes from the increasingly prominent role that the faraday experiment occupies as an example of a non - equilibrium pattern - forming system .",
    "most of the work on pattern formation done to date has focused on convection ( rbc ) and shear flow ( tvf ) @xcite . however , a recent series of papers has established a number of advantages for the faraday experiment @xcite .",
    "very large cells ( @xmath2 wavelengths wide ) may be created , and the basic (  fast \" ) time scale can be very short ( @xmath3 sec . )",
    "the short time scale is particularly important because the dynamics of pattern - forming instabilities is often slow .",
    "current work looks at features that occur on time scales of @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "convection , by contrast , usually has @xmath6 sec . , or slower .",
    "as we shall show below , our variant of the faraday experiment clarifies our understanding of the instability itself .",
    "the analysis separates into two pieces : one is the derivation of the surface - wave dispersion relation ( section iii ) ; the other is the description of how parametric pumping injects energy into the fluid ( section ii ) . by choosing triangle - wave forcing",
    ", we greatly simplify the latter piece .",
    "we hope that this will ultimately allow the nonlinear analysis ( particularly of high - viscosity fluids ) to be pursued further than it has been hitherto . for this reason",
    ", we make no restriction on the fluid viscosity ; the only approximation made is in linearizing the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the body of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : mathieu ] , we study the related problem of the mathieu equation with delta - function forcing .",
    "solving this problem turns out to be mathematically equivalent to solving for the acceleration thresholds of faraday waves . in section [ sec : faraday ] , we apply this analysis to the faraday experiment with triangle - wave forcing . in section [ sec:2freq ]",
    ", we consider a simple extension , driving by an asymmetric triangle wave , which models the recent  two - frequency \" experiments that have attracted much attention @xcite . section [ sec : conclusion ] contains a brief conclusion .",
    "an infinitely extended continuous system such as a fluid can be thought of as containing a continuum number of modes .",
