    "the experimental rate determination and theoretical understanding of the @xmath6 redox reaction in aqueous solution @xmath7 has been a great intellectual challenge for several decades . despite substantial effort ,",
    "the mechanism of the rate is still an unsolved problem .",
    "is the reaction spin - forbidden and diabatic or are spin - excited states thermally accessible which would possibly lead to a spin - allowed , adiabatic reaction ?    experimental studies in the early 1960s suggested an extremely slow rate of @xmath8 @xcite at 64.5 c and 1 m ionic strength using radiocobalt @xmath9c as a tracer .",
    "unfortunately , side reactions involving hydrolysis of the complexes , which contribute to the rate , have not correctly been taken into account . in the 1980s a detailed analysis of previous data using the marcus correlation@xcite led to a much higher estimate of @xmath10 @xcite , and subsequent experiments labeling the ammonia ligands with @xmath11n ( which can be assayed by nmr of the ammine protons and make it possible to trace side reactions ) gave about @xmath12 at 40 c and 2.5 m ionic strength @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the rate at normal conditions ( 25 c and 1 m ionic strength ) gives @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "these results can be expected to be rather trustworthy , because they are , as expected , similar to the rate of a closely related and well understood system , @xmath14 , which has a rate of @xmath15@xcite .",
    "furthermore , an early but less influential measurement of @xmath0 in liquid @xmath16 ( and hence not suffering from hydrolysic side reactions ) indicated a similar rate of order @xmath17@xcite .",
    "briefly , previous results of theory mainly by buhks _ et al _ ( 1978 ) @xcite and newton ( 1986,1991 ) @xcite indicate that the reaction involves the ground state species low - spin @xmath18 , @xmath19 [ co(iii , s=0 ) ] , and high - spin @xmath20 , @xmath2 [ co(ii , s=3/2 ) ] . the spin - excited states , @xmath4 [ co(iii , s=1 ] and @xmath1 [ co(ii , s=1/2 ] , were to high in energy to be thermally populated .",
    "this led to a spin - forbidden ( only possible by weak spin - orbit coupling ) , diabatic reaction with a rate constant of about 4 orders of magnitude too small compared to experiment .",
    "however , work by larsson _",
    "et al _ ( 1985 ) stressed that the ground state - excited state energy separations at the transition state have to be considered , not at the equilibrium geometries . including jahn - teller ( jt ) stabilization energies for the excited states , this led in particular to a substantial energetic lowering of co(ii , s=1/2 ) relative to co(ii , s=3/2 ) .",
    "although this made the reaction spin - allowed , their work suffered from inconsistent data from different electronic structure codes .",
    "furthermore , the rate constant was not determined .    in this paper",
    "we show that the thermal activation barrier for the spin - allowed reaction between co(iii , s=0 ) and co(ii , s=1/2 ) [ total spin s in units of @xmath21 is drastically lowered ( @xmath3 ) compared to the spin - forbidden reaction between co(iii , s=0 ) and co(ii , s=3/2 ) . unlike previously believed , the jt - distorted spin - excited co(ii , s=1/2 ) and the ground state co(ii , s=3/2 ) are near degenerate .",
    "hence the reaction is spin - allowed and adiabatic .",
    "our results are based on the density functional theory ( dft)@xcite code siesta@xcite which we use to calculate spin - excited states of isocharge molecular species and potential energy surfaces ( pess ) . since dft is a ground state theory , excitation energies obtained from ground state energy differences of species with different total spin",
    "are expected to be rather good .",
    "the dft method has the advantage over hartree - fock methods that certain correlations are already build in . from the pess we determine the activation barrier and",
    "provide a new estimate of the rate constant utilizing previously estimated quantities like the @xmath22 - electronic coupling @xmath23 between donor d and acceptor a molecular species , the outer - sphere contribution to the reaction barrier @xmath24 , and the preequilibrium constant @xmath25 .",
    "although our excitation energy of co(iii ) , @xmath26 , is in rather good agreement with the experimental value , we deemphasize the absolute numerical values of excitation energies .",
    "instead we emphasize trends established from dft calculations exploiting that dft usually stabilizes high - spin over low - spin states .",
    "if co(ii ) has a low - spin ground state , this would also explain why the optical absorption @xmath27 has not been observed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in section [ section2 ] we review further experimental and previous theoretical efforts in more detail . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we introduce the dft code siesta and explain our computational methods ( section [ subsection3.1 ] ) , as well as present the calculation of the pess ( section [ subsection3.2 ] ) .",
    "in section [ section4 ] we provide a new estimate of the spin - allowed hexaammine self - exchange reaction based on our insights from the pess and discuss our results .",
    "finally , we summarize in section [ section5 ] .",
    "in this section further experimental facts about the single complexes and a more detailed review of past theoretical efforts are presented .",
    "it is well accepted that @xmath18 [ co(iii ) ] is a stable low - spin ( s=0 ) compound , while it is _ assumed _ that @xmath20 [ co(ii ) ] is high - spin ( s=3/2 ) .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "first it is known from @xmath28 co nmr studies that the related system , @xmath29 , shows no sign of exchange with paramagnetic species@xcite and hence is low - spin .",
    "this is also expected to be true for co(iii ) , since it has an even larger ligand - field favoring low - spin .",
    "x - ray diffraction data of related crystals shows further a drastic difference of the co - n bond distances ( @xmath30 @xcite ) between co(ii ) and co(iii ) . from this",
    "it was concluded that the ligand - field of co(ii ) must be much smaller resulting in high - spin .",
    "additionally , the optical excitation spectrum of co(iii ) could be fully characterized including @xmath31 spin - forbidden transitions .",
    "this is different than co(ii ) , where it could not be measured successfully .",
    "it is further experimentally supported that the @xmath0 self - exchange reaction occurs as outer - sphere .",
    "this is due to a rather slow ligand exchange rate of co(iii ) .",
    "there is considerable thermodynamic and kinetic stability , which arises from effective @xmath32-donation into empty @xmath22-shells@xcite .",
    "the theoretical effort is conveniently discussed in the context of the separable semi - classical transition - state model@xcite @xmath33 in this equation , @xmath25 is the preequilibrium factor describing the probability to form a precursor compound , @xmath34 is an effective nuclear attempt frequency to reach the transition state ( ts ) , @xmath35 is the electronic transmission coefficient evaluated at the ts and averaged over all possible precursor compounds , @xmath36 is the nuclear tunneling factor , and the boltzmann factor ( classical franck - condon factor ) gives the probability to reach the ts with activation free - energy @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) . for the further discussion we review the nomenclature of the important states in figure [ cartoon ] , i.e. their group theoretical representations , total spin s , degeneracy g , and possible couplings ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) .",
    "the couplings ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) are due to spin - orbit coupling or thermal population at finite temperature t , ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) are mainly due to mixing of the electronic @xmath22-orbitals of co(ii ) and co(iii ) mediated by their ligands when a precursor state is formed .    introduction of the ground state @xmath2 [ @xmath19 ] and first excited state @xmath1 [ @xmath4 ] of co(ii ) [ co(iii ) ] , their irreducable representations , total spin s [ @xmath21 , degeneracy g , and possible couplings ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) .",
    "the energy ordering corresponds to the equilibrium co - n bond lengths @xmath41 and @xmath42 of co(ii , s=3/2 ) and co(iii , s=0 ) , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",height=302 ] +    it has been known for about 50 years that extraordinarily slow rates can often be attributed to small franck - condon nuclear overlaps .",
    "these originate from large changes in the metal - ligand bond length in the first coordination sphere@xcite .",
    "this seemed to apply also to the case at hand , if one assumes an adiabatic reaction ( @xmath43 ) `` neglecting '' the spin - forbiddeness .",
    "however , a first detailed theoretical study by e. buhks and co - workers using perturbation theory in the weak spin - orbit coupling to admix spin - excited states shows that the electronic factor is very diabatic , @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this makes the rate constant too small .",
    "orgel@xcite and by stynes and ibers@xcite put out an idea that the reaction could involve thermally excited co(ii , s=1/2 ) making it spin - allowed .",
    "et al _ @xcite went further and argued that the excited states can become much lower in energy near ts .",
    "the important quantities are the energy difference between first excited state and ground state of co(ii ) and co(iii ) as a function of the co - n bond length r @xmath45 in the case of co(iii ) the lowering enhances somewhat the admixture to the ground state , while in case of co(ii ) , @xmath1 becomes even lower than @xmath19 circumventing the spin - barrier .",
    "their argument is based on born - oppenheimer potential energy surfaces ( pes ) calculated both with _ ab initio _ hartree - fock ( hf ) and semi - empirical indo - ci methods including e@xmath46 jt effects for both excited states .",
    "unfortunately their result was not convincing , since the hf calculation predicts the wrong ground state for co(iii ) , while the indo - ci excitation energy @xmath47 @xmath48 was much lower than the generally believed @xmath49 @xmath48@xcite , although there is no experimental evidence for this value .",
    "there has been no absorption found in this region . on the other hand , the excitation energy of co(iii )",
    "is known from experiment to be 13,700 @xmath48@xcite at the co(iii ) equilibrium configuration .",
    "since their calculated value @xmath50 @xmath48 is too large by an amount @xmath51 @xmath48 , the pes from indo - ci were corrected according to @xmath52 it was noted that the semi - empirical indo - ci method is generally very successful in calculating spectra of transition - metal complexes at fixed geometries , but not so in predicting molecular geometries@xcite .    in 1991 ,",
    "newton carried out new _ ab initio _ calculations at both the scf(uhf ) and correlated ( ump2 ) level . using an empirical correction factor as large as @xmath53 @xmath48 ( hf generally favors high - spin )",
    ", he estimated the excitation energies at the transition state to be @xmath54 @xmath48 and @xmath55 @xmath48 , and concluded that thermally excited pathways are not competitive to the spin - forbidden ground state pathway at room temperature ( rt ) .",
    "this left the problem unsolved .",
    "our results of the inner - sphere activation barrier are based on pess obtained from the fully _ ab initio _",
    "code siesta@xcite based on density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "siesta uses troullier - martins norm - conserving pseudo potentials@xcite in the kleinman - bylander form@xcite . for cobalt",
    ", we included spin - polarization and non - linear core corrections@xcite to account for a spin - dependent exchange splitting and correlation effects between core and valence electrons , respectively .",
    "relativistic effects are included for the core electrons in the usual scalar - relativistic approximation ( mass - velocity and darwin terms ) and by averaging over spin - orbit coupling terms , while no spin - orbit coupling is included for the 4s and 3d valence electrons .",
    "this has the computational advantage that spin remains a good quantum number , while resulting errors of the total energy are less crucial when one is interested in total energy differences .",
    "siesta uses a local basis set of pseudo atomic orbitals ( pao ) of multiple @xmath56-type .",
    "the first-@xmath56 orbitals are produced by the method by sankey and niklewski@xcite , while the higher-@xmath56 orbitals are obtained from the split valence method well known from quantum chemistry .",
    "polarization orbitals can also be included .",
    "we used a double-@xmath56 basis set with polarization orbitals ( dzp ) , as well as the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the version by perdew , burke and ernzerhof@xcite for the exchange - correlation energy functional .",
    "the charge densities are calculated on a real space grid , where the fineness of the grid corresponds to an energy cut - off 80 ry .",
    "before going into the details of how we obtained the pess plots , we outline the main ingredients of our calculations .",
    "* our calculations rest on the fixed - spin method within the spin - polarized dft frame work .",
    "two different fermi energies , one for spin - up and one for spin - down , are adjusted in a self - consistent way in order to obtain the ground state of a desired total spin .",
    "if a ground state of a certain spin is higher than the ground state of a different spin , then we know the former as the excited state and the latter one as the true ground state .",
    "nevertheless , there might be several states within a spin - manifold which differ in orbital symmetry .",
    "since the dft method is based on the variational principle , we obtain the state of a system with a certain total spin which has the lowest energy@xcite .",
    "our excitation energies are extracted from total energy differences using the well - established self - consistent - field method ( @xmath57scf)@xcite . this gives generally reliable results for molecules since final state effects are included . *",
    "the ammines are treated as rigid bodies , i.e. the n - h bond lengths and the h - n - h bond angles stay the same throughout all our calculations .",
    "this is justified , since the vibrational frequencies of covalent bonds ( n - h ) are about one order of magnitude higher than the metal - ligand stretching frequencies@xcite and are considered average values .",
    "* we perform geometrical conjugate gradient optimizations ( cgos ) of both co(ii ) and co(iii ) with the spin being fixed to a desired value .",
    "this is used to obtain the equilibrium geometries ( eqgeos ) and the pes .",
    "the eqgeos are optimized or relaxed geometries , where the forces on cobalt and all the ammines are below the chosen tolerance @xmath58 . as for the pess calculations , we constrain the maximum size of a cg step to be @xmath59 in order to provide a large sequence of energies .",
    "the resulting total energy can subsequently be plotted as a function of the co - n bond length averaged over the six ligands . in the case of jt distortions , the average co - n bond length in the axial direction , @xmath60 , and the average co - n bond length in the equatorial plane , @xmath61 , are more reasonable choices .      in the following",
    "we describe the procedure of how we obtained the pes plots in figures [ co3 ] and [ co2 ] .",
    "figure [ co3 ] shows the ground state ( s=0 ) and excited state ( s=1 ) pess of co(iii ) .",
    "for the ground state pes we started a cgo at the co(ii , s=3/2 ) eqgeo , denoted as starting point ( 1 ) , but with the spin fixed to s=0 and charge + 3e .",
    "for the excited state pes ( s=1 ) we started cgos at both the eqgeos of co(iii , s=0 ) , starting point ( 2 ) , and co(ii , s=3/2 ) ( not shown for clarity ) .",
    "the vertical arrow indicates the optical excitation energy from the co(iii , s=0 ) eqgeo , where it is assumed that the excited state is initially not jt distorted , since the excitation is almost instantaneous .",
    "the dotted line in figure [ co3 ] corresponds to total energy versus the average co - n bond length . since co(iii , s=1 )",
    "is jt unstable , we also plot the total energy versus the average axial co - n bond length , @xmath60 , and the average equatorial co - n bond length , @xmath61 , shown by dashed lines .",
    "one can see that essentially only @xmath61 changes when starting a cgo from the co(iii , s=0 ) eqgeo .    in order to obtain smooth pess",
    "it is essential to treat the ammines as rigid bodies .",
    "if one relaxes all the atoms , the resulting pes would be much more complicated , i.e. the pes would display a sequence of short parabolic curves stemming from periods of contracting or stretching the n - h bond lengths , or from changing the h - n - h angles .",
    "the resulting pes would not resemble smooth parabola - like curves ( at least for the non - jt distorted ground states ) anymore , since the reaction coordinate would not simply be the change of the co - n bond length .",
    "although equilibrium energies of the constraint complexes might be higher than the all - atom - relaxed ones , this is not a problem , since we are interested in energy differences and finally in the sum of the co(ii ) and co(iii ) system energies ( overall energy shift which does not affect the rate ) .",
    "figure [ co2 ] shows the ground state s=3/2 and excited state s=1/2 pess of co(ii ) as a function of the co - n bond length averaged over all six ligands . using an analogue procedure , the co(ii , s=3/2 ) pes results from a cgo starting at the co(iii , s=0 ) eqgeo , ( 1 ) , where we have fixed the spin at s=3/2 and the charge at + 2e .",
    "the dotted line shows the co(ii , s=1/2 ) pes , which was obtained from starting at the non - jt distorted co(iii , s=0 ) and co(ii , s=3/2 ) eqgeos , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) respectively .",
    "they stay non - jt distorted .",
    "the vertical arrow indicates the optical excitation to the non - jt distorted co(ii , s=1/2 ) state .",
    "starting geometry ( 4 ) is jt distorted and hence lower in energy than ( 1 ) .",
    "further relaxation with the cgo method ( dashed curve ) lowers the energy drastically by up to @xmath62 compared to the non - jt relaxed energy ( dotted curve ) .",
    "the non - jt distorted pes ( dotted curve ) is hence only meta stable .",
    "the energy of the co(ii , s=1/2 ) eqgeo is only 0.3 kcal / mol ( less than @xmath63 ) higher than the co(ii , s=3/2 ) eqgeo .",
    "+     +    table [ table1 ] contains calculated equilibrium co - n bond lengths of the ground and excited states and their experimental analogous . for comparison",
    "it also shows the ones of the @xmath64 ground states . as typical for the dft method",
    "they are overestimated , about 3% for @xmath16 and 8% for @xmath65 ligands .",
    "table [ table2 ] compares theoretical and experimental optical excitation energies .",
    "the excitation energy @xmath66 for @xmath20 is not known from experiment but is very important .",
    "if this energy separation is low enough co(ii , s=1/2 ) is well - populated at ambient temperatures and the electron transfer reaction is spin - allowed .",
    "although absolute excited state energies from dft can not be trusted , trends established from dft are often correct . from table [ table2 ]",
    "we can obtain the following .",
    "since dft underestimates optical gaps such as the @xmath67 ligand - field , dft favors high - spin compounds .",
    "for instance , the ligand - field splitting of co(iii ) is 274 kj / mol@xcite while siesta gives 246 kj / mol . in other words , excitations from low - spin to high - spin ( @xmath68 ) are underestimated while excitations from high - spin to low - spin ( @xmath66 and @xmath69 ) are overestimated .",
    "similar results were found for singlet - triplet gaps of phenylnitrene and other hypovalent systems@xcite .",
    ".[table1 ] equilibrium co - ligand bond lengths for cobalt hexaammine and hexaaqua complexes in units of @xmath70 .",
    "jahn - teller ( jt ) distorted values : @xmath60 denotes the co - ligand bond length in axial direction , while @xmath61 in the equatorial plane . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "at this point , there are two main possibilities why there is a 2 order of magnitude disagreement between our , @xmath71 , and the experimental rate , @xmath72 .",
    "either something is not correct with the theoretical estimate , or the experimental rate constant is too small . in the more likely case",
    "that the theory misses some details , the sources of possible errors are the @xmath66 excitation energy and hence the prefactor of eq .",
    "( [ k2 ] ) . increasing the energy of the co(ii , s=1/2 ) pess w.r.t .",
    "co(ii , s=3/2 ) by a constant energy shift @xmath73 and hence increasing the excitation energy to @xmath74 , produces the experimental value .",
    "this , however , is in conflict with the trend of excitation energies established from the dft method .",
    "another vague possibility of errors in our theory could originate from a more complicated cross - over from the jt distorted co(ii , s=1/2 ) equilibrium complex to thermally excited non - jt distorted co(ii , s=1/2 ) near ts .",
    "the cross - over could be rather unlikely , since the symmetry changes .",
    "on the other hand , possible experimental issues are beyond our realm of knowledge .",
    "although a difficult experiment , it has been thoroughly studied over decades . nevertheless , generally forgotten , neglected or underestimated side - reactions lead to an underestimation of the rate constant . in particular",
    ", the existence of high - spin co(ii , s=3/2 ) is challenged by our analysis .",
    "this leads to the question , if the assumption of high - spin co(ii , s=3/2 ) was wrongly made when deriving certain rates of side - reactions .",
    "having said this , an error of about 2 orders of magnitude in the rate estimate is not as bad as it may sound . due to the activated nature of the reaction , the exponential dependence of the rate on the activation barrier and excitation energy makes it very sensitive to small errors .",
    "within marcus theory of charge transfer the rate constant of the hexaamminecobalt - self - exchange reaction was redetermined .",
    "we utilized the dft code siesta to calculate born - oppenheimer potential energy surfaces and spin - excitation energies and use previously determined parameters .",
    "the main differences from former work is the near degeneracy of co(ii , s=3/2 ) and co(ii , s=1/2 ) .",
    "furthermore , we observed a drastic lowering of the activation barrier ( @xmath3 ) for the reaction pathway involving and co(iii , s=0 ) and co(ii , s=1/2 ) .",
    "this led to a rate constant of order @xmath71 which is 2 orders of magnitude faster than experiment .",
    "possible sources of errors are outlined in section [ section5 ] and having most likely to do with the neglect of the proper cross - over treatment from jahn - teller distorted equilibrium co(ii , s=1/2 ) to non - jahn - teller distorted co(ii , s=1/2 ) near the transition state .",
    "the good quality of our energetics involved in the rate constant evaluation is indicated , first because our calculated excitation energy @xmath75 of co(iii ) , @xmath76 , agrees well with the experimental value @xmath77 .",
    "second , our excitation energy @xmath78 of co(ii ) , @xmath66 , is close to larsson s value from indo - ci ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "this energy is in particular important for charge transfer .",
    "unfortunately , the corresponding optical absorption peak could not be found experimentally .",
    "this may simply be explained by the spin - forbiddeness and vibrational broadening because of differences in equilibrium co - n bond distances and a jahn - teller unstable excited state . on the other hand , our analysis questions the existence of the high - spin ground state co(ii , s=3/2 ) and",
    "hence can provide an alternative explanation for the absence the the absorption peak .",

    "<S> we have reexamined the thermally induced @xmath0 [ co(ii / iii ) ] redox reaction using the first principles density - functional - theory method , semiclassical marcus theory , and known charge transfer parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm a previously suggested mechanism involving excited state ( @xmath1 ) of co(ii ) which becomes lower than the ground state ( @xmath2 ) in the transition state region . </S>",
    "<S> this lowers the transition state barrier considerably by @xmath3 and leads to a spin - allowed and adiabatic electron exchange process . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are consistent with previous experimental results regarding the spin - excitation energy ( @xmath4 ) of co(iii ) , and the fact that an optical absorption peak ( @xmath1 ) of the co(ii ) species could not be found experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> our rate is of order @xmath5 and hence 2 orders of magnitude faster than determined previously by experiments . </S>"
