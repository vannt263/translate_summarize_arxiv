    "an electronic state in atoms , molecules , or solids has a particular spatial character usually represented by an orbital or a linear combination of such orbitals well - established in quantum chemistry . since an enormous number of different kinds of orbitals coexist and they usually overlap in a real material , it is difficult to select or probe a particular orbital in real solids .",
    "recently , as fabrication techniques of nanometer - sized material units such as carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) are developed , control over individual electronic states in a material is improving quite remarkably.@xcite here we show theoretically that , in a multiply connected armchair carbon nanotube ( mcacn ) system with a mirror - reflection symmetry , we can produce an electron current of one particular orbital character ( the @xmath0-bonding @xmath2 orbital or simply @xmath0 orbital ) and suppress the current flow of the other type of electrons ( the @xmath0-antibonding @xmath2 orbital or simply @xmath3 orbital ) over a significantly wide range of energy .",
    "it means that the system is metallic for one kind of orbitals and insulating for another orbitals , in close analogy to a half - metal which is metallic for , say , up - spins and insulating for down - spins .",
    "the electron tunneling probability from this system to a molecule critically depends on the orbital character of the molecule because of a different degree of overlap between the wave functions of this system and the molecule .",
    "the system behaves like an electronic orbital valve ( filter ) which selectively transmits the @xmath0 orbitals only .",
    "furthermore , it may be used as a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) to probe the orbital characters of molecules or pairing symmetry in @xmath1-wave superconductors or even orbital ordering in solids which is believed to occur in some transition - metal oxides.@xcite    in this paper , we report interesting transport properties of an mcacn structure as shown in fig .",
    "1 , where a single metallic tube is branched off into two smaller arms and then they merge into one.@xcite our model comprises two leads of semi - infinite metallic ( 6,6 ) cnts and two arms of finite ( 3,3 ) tubes in between . figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) show mcacns with two arms of finite ( 3,3 ) tubes of the same length and of two different arm lengths , respectively .",
    "in fact , there is an unpublished report@xcite that such a ",
    "needle s eye configuration \" has been formed , though not intentionally fabricated , by electron irradiation on nanotubes and observed in the transmission electron microscopy image of nanotubes .",
    "six heptagons are contained in each of two junction regions where a thicker tube and two thinner tubes are joined .",
    "these heptagons near each junction area act as a scattering center for electrons incident from the lead [ the ( 6,6 ) nanotube ] .",
    "the length of the arm region is represented by the number ( @xmath4 ) of periodic units of the armchair cnt as shown in fig .",
    "1 . in the following study",
    ", we require that the structure possesses the mirror - reflection symmetry with respect to a plane containing the axes of the ( 3,3 ) and the ( 6,6 ) tubes ( i.e. , the plane of fig .",
    "1 containing the tube axis ) .",
    "an energy band consisting of @xmath0 orbitals and another band of @xmath3 orbitals are crossing at the fermi energy ( @xmath5 ) in the armchair cnt and they are usually admixed when defects are introduced into the perfect nanotubes breaking symmetries of the structure . however , the situation is different if a mirror - reflection symmetry with respect to the plane containing the tube axes is maintained .",
    "the @xmath0 orbital is even with respect to the mirror - reflection whereas the @xmath6 orbital is odd with respect to it .",
    "then @xmath0 and @xmath6 transport channels remain unmixed and mutually independent , which is a rigorous result of quantum mechanics .",
    "the electronic structure is described by the single @xmath0-electron tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 denote the nearest neighbor pairs , the hopping integral @xmath9 ev  @xcite and the on - site energy is set to zero . in our scattering - state approach ,",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation for the whole system by matching the solutions of the tight - binding equation in the arm with that of each lead ( the perfect nanotube ) region at the interface on the left and right .",
    "for a given incoming electron wave from the left lead as an initial condition , we obtain the transmitted electron emerging on the right lead ( as well as the reflected electron traveling to the left ) .",
    "conductance is obtained from the landauer - bttiker formula , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the conductance quantum ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 is the transmission matrix.@xcite",
    "the conductance as a function of the incident electron energy is displayed in fig .",
    "two arm lengths are assumed to be the same in fig .",
    "2(a ) . the total conductance",
    "is decomposed into two nonmixing contributions of @xmath0 and @xmath6 channels , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the transmission probabilities of the two . since the @xmath0 orbitals do not have phase variation in the circumferential direction around the tube irrespective of @xmath17 in ( @xmath17,@xmath17 )",
    "tubes , @xmath0 orbitals in the lead parts [ ( 6,6 ) tubes ] have almost perfect match with those in the arms [ ( 3,3 ) tubes ] , and the transmission is close to unity in a wide energy range . on the other hand ,",
    "the sign of @xmath6 orbitals alternates rapidly over the perimeter of the tube .",
    "the @xmath6 orbitals in the lead part can not match with those of two smaller arms simultaneously .",
    "therefore , the transmission of @xmath6 orbitals through the system is mostly suppressed except for the near resonant energy levels as displayed in fig .",
    "2(a ) .    to understand the positions and the linewidths of these conductance peaks , we investigate the structure of the wave functions in more detail . besides the linear @xmath0 and @xmath6 bands crossing at @xmath5 , there exist a conduction band at 1.3 ev and above , and a valence band at @xmath181.3 ev and below in the ( 6,6 ) tube .",
    "because of the presence of the heptagonal carbon rings at the junction , donor - like states tend to be produced according to well - known hckel s ( @xmath19 ) rule for stability.@xcite the localized state due to topological defects ( 7-membered rings ) at y - junctions is most pronounced if the energy level is close to ( and below ) the aforementioned conduction band minimum ( cbm ) at 1.3 ev .",
    "the sharp peaks closest to the cbm in fig .",
    "2(a ) corresponds to this state and has a narrow lineshape owing to the relatively well - localized ( long lifetime ) character of such an origin .",
    "the resonant states further away from the cbm are less localized and thus broader .",
    "they may be regarded as states confined in the arm region broadened by the interaction with the continuum of metallic states in the lead regions on both sides .",
    "we also note that the interference between a narrow and a broad level gives rise to asymmetric resonant peak structure which is known as ",
    "fano resonance.\"@xcite we previously found the same features in a larger mcacn which comprises two leads of semi - infinite metallic ( 10,10 ) cnts and two arms of finite ( 5,5 ) tubes of the same length in between,@xcite but the phenomenon of the orbital valve was not emphasized at the time , which will be studied in detail below .",
    "we now examine the orbital valve ( filter ) in the conductance of the system . in all cases",
    "we study , there exists a finite energy range where the conductance of @xmath6 electrons is almost zero while that of @xmath0 electrons is not reduced appreciably .",
    "for instance , the transmitted electrons of @xmath6 orbital for the mcacn with two different arm lengths of @xmath20 and @xmath21 in fig .",
    "1(b ) constitute less than 5% of the total transmitted electrons in the energy range between @xmath180.2 and 0.1 ev as shown fig .",
    "figure 3 shows charge density plots of scattering states in the mcacns and explains two origins causing almost perfect reflection of @xmath6 electrons in the wide energy range . as depicted in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , the incident wave at @xmath22 ev from the left lead is reflected at the left y - junction , regardless of lengths of two arms .",
    "in contrast , the incident wave at @xmath23 ev from the left lead is reflected at the right y - junction because of the destructive interference by two paths of different lengths as seen in fig .",
    "3(c ) , in analogy to young s double - slit experiment . here",
    "@xmath22 ev is chosen because the mcacn with the same arm length has the transmission zero at this energy , and @xmath23 ev is chosen because a realistic orbital filter could operate without gate bias for electrons near the fermi energy .",
    "this phenomenon , which we call  orbital filtering , \" is a counterpart of spin filtering in half - metals such as la@xmath24sr@xmath25mno@xmath26 .",
    "half - metal has been extensively studied for possible applications as a spin valve in spintronics .",
    "the difference is that , while the density of states ( dos ) of up - spins is finite and that of down - spins is zero at the fermi level in half - metals , the electrical conductance ( rather than the dos ) of @xmath0 orbitals is finite and that of @xmath6 orbitals is zero in the mcacn though the doss of both @xmath0 and @xmath6 orbitals are nonzero at the fermi level .",
    "such a non - equilibrium distribution of current - carrying states ( imbalance between @xmath0 and @xmath6 states ) may be maintained over the relaxation length ( at least several nm ) of the electron phase beyond the arm region .",
    "the mcacn acts as an orbital filter and this concept can be used for a further fundamental research on the electronic character in nanostructures or an application to an orbital switch or orbital sensor using nanotubes .",
    "we note that there is increasing interest in identifying orbital degrees of freedom in various transition - metal oxides such as la@xmath24sr@xmath27mno@xmath28 and ca@xmath29sr@xmath27mno@xmath28.@xcite    people have used , for instance , cross - polarized optical microscopes to probe orbital ordering with the micron - scale resolution . using the mcacn system as an stm , in principle , it is possible to probe electrically the orbital character of a molecule or orbital ordering in solids .",
    "the principle is identical to the spin valve system in the spin switch or spin sensor . if an orbital in a sample matches and overlaps well with the @xmath0-orbital of the probe ( nanotube ) , the tunneling current increases . if the orbital character in the sample differs ( or points to an unfavorable direction ) from the probe orbital , the current decreases or vanishes because the tunneling current is proportional to the absolute square of the overlap integral . for most materials ,",
    "occupation of a specific orbital at the expense of vacating other orbitals is an extreme non - equilibrium situation and the relaxation to equilibrium distribution ( equal occupation of the same energy states ) occurs typically in a time scale of less than 1 fs .",
    "this is a severe restriction on the practical experiment for the orbital probe . a great advantage of using carbon nanotubes for the single - orbital ( i.e.",
    ", @xmath0 orbital only ) current source is that the electron phase coherence length ( or phase relaxation length ) @xmath30 in carbon nanotubes is known to be unprecedentedly long ( several tens of nm even at room temperature).@xcite having a source of constant phase , we can probe orbital character of a molecule or orbital ordering on the surface of solids .",
    "the quantitative analysis of the tunneling data requires a more detailed numerical integration because the @xmath0-orbital state actually consists of atomic @xmath2 orbitals which have sign change in the radial direction of the nanotube ( though not in the circumferential direction ) .",
    "figure 4 shows a pedagogical example of the square of the overlap integral between the @xmath0 state of the carbon nanotube and an atomic _ d _ orbital ( @xmath31 ) . for definiteness , we choose a single @xmath32 and @xmath33 orbitals of a hydrogen - like atom ( the atomic number @xmath34 ; the effective core charge@xcite for _ d_-electrons in a mn atom ) .",
    "the _ xy _ coordinates of the figure indicate the position of the center of the nanotube with respect to the atom .",
    "the distance in the _",
    "z_-direction between the edge of the tube and the atom is chosen to be 7  .",
    "the axis of the tube is perpendicular to the _ xy_-plane .",
    "this simple example demonstrates that the current of @xmath0 orbitals from the nanotube ( acting as an stm tip ) can unambiguously distinguish between @xmath32 and @xmath33 orbitals possibly even at room temperature . due to the orbital sign change in the circumferential direction of the nanotube , in contrast ,",
    "the square of the overlap integral between the @xmath6 state of the carbon nanotube and an atomic _ d _ orbital ( @xmath35 ) does not represent the shape of the _ d _ orbital .",
    "we have carried out tight - binding calculations for conductance of mcacns with the mirror symmetry . it is found that the electron current of one particular orbital character ( @xmath0 orbital ) is sustained while the current flow of other electrons ( @xmath3 orbital ) is suppressed over a wide range of energy .",
    "it implies that the system is metallic for one kind of orbitals and insulating for another orbitals , in close resemblance to a half - metal used in spintronics . since the electron tunneling probability from this system to a molecule or s solid critically depends on the orbital characters of the molecule or surface atoms , the system may be used as a probing tip of the orbital character of molecules or solids",
