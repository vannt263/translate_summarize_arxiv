    "pep - ii @xcite , running from mid-1999 to april 2008 , has reached 4 times the design peak luminosity , delivering to the babar experiment an integrated luminosity larger than 557 fb@xmath1 ( see fig .",

    "kekb @xcite also started operation in 1999 and reached a peak luminosity 60@xmath2 higher than the design value , delivering about 820 fb@xmath1 ( up to april 2008 ) to belle ( see fig .",

    "very good performances and high operation reliability represent a big success for all the factories , and upgrade of an order of magnitude or more in luminosity is desirable for investigation on particle physics beyond the standard model .",

    "the initial design meets the goals requested by the experimenters .",
    "the test on this scheme is in progress at da@xmath3ne and encouraging results have been achieved at the moment .",
    "the work on the accelerator is continuing to focus on possible issues .",
    "the next step will be to form a team to complete a technical design report by 2010 .",
    "operation of present b - factories has been very successful and an upgrade of is desirable and feasible .",
    "kekb and pep - ii experience was highly positive and instructive , but going to higher luminosities is much more challenging : the  brute force \" approach seems hard to pursue and new ideas need to be tested .",
    "solutions to problems can come from the collaboration between international laboratories , as it is done for the ilc .",
    "two different approaches are being considered for super - kekb and superb , with different challenges .",
    "super - kekb is the natural continuation of kekb , studies are advanced and it is waiting for funding .",
    "superb exploits new concepts in colliding beams physics , allowing for the collection of a larger data sample .",
    "the test of the novel collision scheme is in progress and the first results of the upgraded da@xmath3ne are very encouraging and important for the very high luminosity regime required by future flavour physics studies .",

    "<S> operation of the b - factories ( pep - ii and kekb ) has been very successful , both having exceeded their design peak and integrated luminosity and provided a huge amount of good data to the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> proposal for upgrades , in order to achieve about two order of magnitude larger luminosity , are in progress in japan , with super - kekb , and in europe , with superb . </S>",
    "<S> very high beam intensity , very short bunch length and low interaction point @xmath0-functions are the key points of the japanese design , very challenging for the hardware components ( rf , vacuum ) . on the other hand superb exploits a new collision scheme , namely large piwinski angle and  crab waist \" , which will allow for reaching a luminosity two order of magnitude larger without increasing beam currents and decreasing bunch lengths . in this talk the present status of the two projects will be briefly reviewed . </S>"
