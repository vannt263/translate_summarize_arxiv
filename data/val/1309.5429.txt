    "@xmath0-bands are responsible for the low - energy electronic properties of graphitic systems , including single and multilayer graphene .",
    "it is often convenient to base theories of electronic properties on orthogonal orbital tight - binding models similar to the slonczewski - weiss - mcclure@xcite ( swm ) @xmath0-band tight - binding model used extensively in graphite .",
    "the most important parameters in these models are the near - neighbor hopping amplitude within the graphene layers , which sets the @xmath0-band width , and the near - neighbor inter - layer hopping amplitude which partially splits@xcite the two states per layer which are nearly degenerate at the brillouin - zone corner points @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "although smaller in magnitude other parameters still play a crucial role in determining electronic properties in multi - layer graphene systems , for example by moving level crossings ( dirac points ) away from @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and can not be guessed with sufficient accuracy simply by making analogies with the graphite case . in this paper",
    "we attempt to achieve a broader perspective on these tight - binding models by deriving a @xmath0-band model for bilayer graphene from _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations .",
    "bilayer graphene is the simplest multi - layer system and can be viewed as an isolated copy of the two - layer repeating unit of bernal or ab stacked graphite .",
    "tight - binding models for bilayer graphene have been proposed previously based on analogies to the swm model for graphite @xcite , on phenomenological fits to raman @xcite and infrared @xcite measurements , and on parametric fits to first principles bands.@xcite    the literature on tight - binding models for bilayer graphene does not provide consistent magnitudes or even signs for the small remote hopping parameters that reshape the bands near the dirac points .",
    "in this paper we obtain @xmath0-band tight - binding models from first principles lda electronic structure calculations combined with maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwf ) centered at the carbon sites.@xcite models based on wannier functions with well defined symmetries benefit from the orthonormality of the localized orbitals and give rise to matrix elements that can be physically interpreted as hopping between @xmath0 orbitals centered on different sites . a @xmath0-band only model for bilayer graphene should be accurate because hybridization between @xmath0 and @xmath4 orbitals is weak in all multi - layer graphene systems.@xcite calculations based on the lda have the advantage that they do not incorporate the many - body band renormalisations due to screened non - local exchange that are known to be important in graphene and multi - layer graphene systems .",
    "the resulting bands can therefore be used as a starting point for studies of many - body band renormalization , as is common practice for example in gw approximations calculations.@xcite    the present work extends a previous analysis carried out for single layer graphene , @xcite to the case of bernal stacked bilayer graphene .",
    "the hamiltonian we obtain provides an intuitive understanding of remote hopping processes both within and between layers .",
    "one important finding is that both intra - layer and inter - layer hopping processes have longer range than assumed in phenomenological tight - binding models .",
    "we therefore propose a systematic scheme which we use to obtain alternate effective tight - binding models with a smaller number of parameters which retain both accuracy near dirac points and a good description of the full @xmath0-bands .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : mainsection ] we summarize the full tight - binding ( ftb ) model of bilayer graphene s @xmath0-bands obtained from a calculation that constructs maximally localized wannier functions . in section [ sec : effectivemodel ] we explain the relationship between tight - binding and continuum models and the scheme used to derive the simplified tight - binding models which we hope will be a convenient starting point for some @xmath0-band electronic property theories .",
    "we then devote section [ swm ] to a comparison between our simplified models and models that have been used in the literature for bilayer graphene systems .",
