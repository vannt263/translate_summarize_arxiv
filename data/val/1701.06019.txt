    "in 1998 , the accelerating expansion of the universe was discovered by measuring the relation between redshift and distance of sne ia @xcite . the physical origin of accelerating is still debated .",
    "the term `` dark energy '' is put forward to explain the accelerating universe .",
    "meanwhile , the modification of equations governing gravity can also explain the acceleration of the universe ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "besides sne ia , other observations , such as cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hubble parameters ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can probe the nature of accelerating expansion .",
    "sne ia are ideal standard candles to probe dark energy .",
    "but several effects can degrade their quality , such as the dust in light path @xcite , the possible intrinsic evolution in sn luminosity , gravitational lensing magnification @xcite , peculiar velocity @xcite , and so on .",
    "these processes will degrade the standard candle usefulness of sne ia . besides the above effects , compton dimming due to free electrons deplete photons from standard candles by the ( inverse ) compton scattering can cause systematic error for cosmological studies @xcite . these effects can degrade the evidence of accelerating expansion , or even mimic the dark energy behavior .",
    "so comprehensive study of the cosmic opacity is needed . especially for the wide field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) era , which can detect more than 2000 sne ia @xcite .",
    "if the cosmic opacity is not corrected , it will not increase statistical errors , but may also systematically bias the cosmological parameters .    over the past several years",
    ", the cosmic distance duality ( cdd ) relation has been widely used to test the systematic errors and opacity in sne ia observations .",
    "the cdd relation reads @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the luminosity distance , and @xmath3 is the angular diameter distance .",
    "we must note that the cosmic opacity has no effect on the angular diameter @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it is valid for all cosmological models based on riemannian geometry .",
    "the bases of this relation are that the number of photons is conservative and the photons travel along the null geodesics in a riemannian spacetime @xcite .",
    "but the conservation of photons may be violated in a wide range of well - motivated models . in modern astronomy ,",
    "the cdd relation plays a significant role . in order to test this relation ,",
    "many works have been performed .",
    "for example , @xcite found a 2@xmath4 violation of cdd relation using @xmath2 from sne ia and @xmath3 from friib radio galaxies .",
    "the angular diameter from x - ray observations of galaxy clusters also has been used to probe the cdd relation @xcite .",
    "similar works have also been done by other authors @xcite .",
    "@xcite used cmb anisotropies to test the cdd relation .",
    "this relation is also applied extensively .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used the cdd relation to test the gas mass density profile of galaxy clusters . @xcite calibrated the distances of sne ia using the cdd relation .    a powerful method to study the opacity of the universe is using the standard candles to detect possible cdd deviations , such as sne ia and grbs . for example , @xcite adopted a modified cdd relation @xmath5 to constrain the cosmic opacity by combining the sne ia data @xcite with the measurements of the hubble expansion over redshift range @xmath6 @xcite . in the flat @xmath0cdm model",
    ", they found @xmath7 @xmath8 . in @xcite , they marginalized over the parameter @xmath9 and used sne ia alone to constrain parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    ". @xcite presented some tests for the cosmic opacity with observational data including the union 2.1 sne ia sample and galaxy cluster samples compiled by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they found that an almost transparent universe is favored by the sample @xcite .",
    "basing on the validity of the amati relation , @xcite determined the cosmic opacity at high redshifts using grbs , and found that a transparent universe is favored .",
    "strong gravitational lensing systems are also used to probe the cdd realtion @xcite .",
    "compared with previous papers , our paper has three advancements to this field .",
    "first , it must be noted that previous studies directly used the luminosity distances of sne ia , which are derived in the concordance cosmology ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the luminosity distances depend on the light - curve fitting parameters and cosmological models @xcite .",
    "so the derived results are biased by the assumed cosmological model . here , in order to avoid this problem , we perform a global fitting for the sne ia light - curve parameters , cosmological parameters and cosmic opacity .",
    "second , we also investigate the cosmic opacity at high redshifts , where the fraction of electrons is evolving with redshift . the reionization process is considered .",
    "the cross section of compton scattering for high - energy photons is also a function of redshfit .",
    "third , the contribution from compton scattering effect to the cosmic opacity is constrained for the first time . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the cosmic opacity with sne ia , long grbs and hubble parameter data .",
    "we pay special attention to the compton scattering effect .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    ", we describe the cosmic opacity and compton scatter extinction . in section 3 ,",
    "the observational data used in the statistical analysis are presented .",
    "the corresponding constraints on the cosmic opacity are given in section 4 .",
    "the paper is finished with a summary of the main results in the conclusion section .",
    "since photons can be scattered with free electrons and interstellar medium when travel from the source to the observer , the received photons number will be reduced .",
    "the distance modulus derived from standard candles will increase the systematic error .",
    "any process reducing photon number would increase the luminosity distance of the source and dim its luminosity .",
    "following @xcite , we regard @xmath12 as the opacity from the @xmath13 to the resource redshift due to extinction .",
    "then , the received flux will decrease with a factor @xmath14 .",
    "so the relation between observed luminosity distance @xmath15 and theoretic luminosity distance @xmath16 is @xmath17 the observed distance modulus is given by @xmath18 for flat flrw cosmology , the distance modulus is @xmath19 and @xmath20 combining equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , we obtain the exactly form of cosmic opacity @xmath21      compton scattering is the inelastic scattering of the photon by a charged free electron . the optical depth for compton scattering",
    "is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the thomson cross section , @xmath24 is the free electron density , @xmath25 is the light speed , and @xmath26 is the redshift . in the above equation , @xmath27 @xmath28 is the hydrogen number density at redshift @xmath26 , and @xmath29 is a factor which is introduced by including the ionization of helium . because the reionization epoch contains both hydrogen and helium .",
    "the mass fractions of hydrogen and helium are @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite , respectively .",
    "we assume that the helium was only ionized once .",
    "so we derive @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is defined as the volume filling fraction of ionized hydrogen , which can be calculated from the differential equation @xcite @xmath34 in this equation , @xmath35 @xmath28s@xmath36 is the recombination coefficient for electron with temperature at about @xmath37 k. @xmath38 is the rate of ionizing photons escaping from the stars into the igm , which can be derived from @xmath39 where @xmath40 is used for converting the comoving density into the proper density , @xmath41 is the star formation rate ( sfr ) , @xmath42 is the baryon mass , @xmath43 are the number of ionizing uv photons released per baryon , and @xmath44 is the escape fraction of these photons from stars into igm .",
    "the escape fraction is not well constrained from observations .",
    "@xmath45 is the average value suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "other similar value are reported .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that @xmath46 evolves from @xmath47 percent at @xmath48 to @xmath49 6 10 percent at @xmath50 from star forming regions in young galaxies . @xcite",
    "proposed a redshift evolution of @xmath46 . in this work ,",
    "we take the value of @xmath43 as @xmath49 4000 and the escape fraction @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is the clumping factor of the ionized gas .",
    "its value decreases with increasing redshifts from some numerical simulations @xcite and semi - analytical studies @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we take @xmath53 @xmath54 is the sfr .",
    "the sfr derived by @xcite is used .",
    "then we can solve the differential equation ( 9 ) to obtain @xmath55 .",
    "the result is shown in figure 1 .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , the equation ( 8) with a constant ionization fraction can be expressed as @xmath56^{\\frac{1}{2}}-1\\},\\ ] ] in the flat @xmath0cdm model by neglecting the radiation term . at redshift range @xmath57 ,",
    "a constant ionization fraction @xmath58 is adopted , which is reasonable for sne ia .",
    "the optical depth can increase the distance modulus with a relation @xmath59 from equation ( 4 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the compton scattering effect on the distance modulus . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the value of @xmath60 is increasing with redshift , and the compton scattering dims the supernova flux by 0.003 mag at @xmath61 and 0.01 mag at @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "this dimming is too faint to rule out the existence of dark energy .",
    "however , its effect can not be negligible for future sne ia surveys plan such as wfirst , which will measure @xmath49 2700 sne ia to @xmath63 . for future surveys , the major statistical uncertainty is the sn intrinsic fluctuations . with the sne ia number @xmath64 , the intrinsic fluctuations are reduced to a level of @xmath65 mag , where @xmath66 is the intrinsic dispersion in sn luminosity .",
    "it means that the compton dimming effect must be corrected .",
    "otherwise the induced systematic errors would be comparable to the statistical errors . from above analysis , we conclude that the compton scattering can be correctable , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the photons emitted from grbs are different from those from sne ia .",
    "first , the energy of the grb photons are much more energetic . at high energies , cross section of the compton scattering is suppressed .",
    "so more photons can escape from scattering to the observer .",
    "second , grbs can be observed at high redshifts .",
    "high - energy photons have much more probability to interact with free electrons .",
    "the optical depth of compton scattering for high - energy photons can be written as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is given by the klein - nishina formula @xcite @xmath69.\\ ] ] here , @xmath70 is the observed energy of @xmath71ray photons .",
    "the future sovm ( space - based multiband astronomical variable objects monitor ) mission , will detect some grbs at @xmath72 @xcite . at these high - redshifts ,",
    "the hydrogen is not completely ionized .",
    "the parameter @xmath55 is a constant in equation ( 13 ) , and the reionization process must be considered .",
    "we use the reionization process described in section 2.1 to calculate the optical depth .",
    "the systematic shift in distance modulus @xmath60 due to compton scattering is shown in figure 3 .",
    "it is obvious that the effect of compton scattering for low - energy photons is significant , because the cross section is suppressed for high - energy photons .",
    "the evolution of @xmath60 becomes flat at high redshifts , due to few free electrons from reionization .",
    "the @xmath60 caused by compton dimming increases with reshift .",
    "its value can reach to 0.01 - 0.04 mag , which is smaller than the intrinsic error of grb distance @xcite .",
    "so we can ignore it if the number of grbs is less than 100 and the redshift of grb is not very high .",
    "however , if more than 100 high - redshift long grbs will be used to study cosmology , the compton dimming is non - negligible .",
    "in this section , we will show the data sets .",
    "these data sets will be used to constrain the cosmic opacity and cosmological parameters . unlike previous works",
    ", we try to global fit the sne ia light - curve parameters , cosmological parameters and the cosmic opacity .",
    "in this work , we use 740 sne ia from the  joint light - curve analysis \" sample compiled by @xcite .",
    "the redshift range is from @xmath73 to @xmath74 .",
    "this sample includes sne ia from different surveys.in their work , they regard the possible extinction as systematic uncertainty . in order to avoid the effect of cosmological model effect , the parameters of the sne ia light - curve , cosmological parameters and the cosmic opacity are fitting simultaneously .",
    "therefore , only the statistical error which from error propagation of light - curve fitting uncertainties and the variation of magnitudes caused by the intrinsic variation in sn magnitude are needed to consider in our work .",
    "the possible extinctions are all regarded as cosmic opacity .",
    "the distance modulus is written as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the observed peak magnitude in rest - frame @xmath77 band . @xmath78 and @xmath79 are nuisance parameters which describe the stretch - luminosity and color - luminosity relations , reflecting the well - known broader - brighter and bluer - brighter relations , respectively .",
    "the nuisance parameter @xmath80 represents the absolute magnitude of a fiducial sne ia and is found to depend on the properties of host galaxies , e.g. , the host stellar mass ( @xmath81 ) . here ,",
    "we follow the procedure in @xcite to approximately correct for this effect by a simple step function : @xmath82      for grbs , we use the grb data given in @xcite .",
    "they use the @xmath83-@xmath84 correlation @xcite to build the hubble diagram .",
    "@xcite combine their 42 grbs and 109 grbs from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath83-@xmath84 correlation can be written as @xmath85 where parameters @xmath25 and @xmath86 are free parameters , @xmath83 is the isotropic equivalent energy , and @xmath87 is the peak energy of @xmath88 spectrum , which has been corrected into the cosmological rest frame . in their work , they calibrate 90 high - redshift grbs in the redshift range from 1.44 to 8.1 with a fixed value of @xmath9 .",
    "we constrain the cosmological parameters and the cosmic opacity use this sub - sample @xcite . in order to consider the effect of compton dimming , we show the value of @xmath60 for this sample as dots in figure 3 , which is derived from equations ( 4 ) and ( 13 ) .",
    "the error bar is due to the uncertainty of the observational peak energy of grbs .",
    "the value of @xmath60 caused by compton dimming is far less than the top black dash line .",
