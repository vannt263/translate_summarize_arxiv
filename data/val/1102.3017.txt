    "backflow correlations were introduced by feynman and cohen  @xcite in order to obtain an accurate description of the excitation spectrum of liquid he@xmath0 . indeed , by accounting for these correlations , it was possible to have a marked improvement in the one - phonon dispersion curve and obtain an accurate description of the roton excitations .",
    "indeed , it was realized that a picture of independent elementary excitations had to be extended to account for their interactions .",
    "essentially , the current associated with a feynman excitation involves a contribution from the backflow of the fluid around it .",
    "feynman and cohen showed that , in the simplest case of a particle tearing through the liquid at a given velocity , the pattern of induced longitudinal current far away from the particle has a dipolar form .",
    "@xcite then , the concept of backflow has been extended to weakly - correlated electron systems , where it turned out to be crucial for improving the description of the electron gas in two and three dimensions , in particular , for correlation energies and pair distribution functions .",
    "@xcite further applications concerned metallic hydrogen  @xcite and small atoms or molecules ,  @xcite where significant improvements in the total energy have been obtained .    very recently",
    ", backflow correlations have been successfully applied to strongly - correlated electron systems , such as the hubbard model and its generalizations to include frustrating terms , improving the variational wave functions used so far to approximate the exact ground state . in particular , in presence of frustration ( e.g. , for the @xmath1 hubbard model on the square  @xcite and the triangular lattices  @xcite ) a spin - liquid phase has been stabilized only thanks to backflow correlations .",
    "this new term allowed us also to observe a renormalization of the underlying fermi surface to perfect nesting at the metal - insulator transition .",
    "@xcite backflow correlations have been also recently applied to the infinite-@xmath2 hubbard model to study the stability of the nagaoka ferromagnetism .",
    "@xcite    when compared to former variational wave functions for frustrated hubbard models ,  @xcite ( short - range ) backflow correlations significantly improved the description of ground - state properties with respect to density - density jastrow factors  @xcite and holon - doublon binding factors .",
    "@xcite however , also in presence of backflow terms , the long - range jastrow factor is still a fundamental ingredient of the wave function in order to describe the metal - insulator transition occurring at a finite value of the ratio between the electron - electron repulsion @xmath2 and the hopping integral @xmath3 .    in this paper , we show the accuracy of backflow correlations and compare them with the @xmath4-matrix ( i.e. , strong - coupling ) expansion .",
    "@xcite the latter approach becomes exact for @xmath5 and define an iterative procedure which results in an expansion in powers of @xmath6 .",
    "as a consequence , the ( exact ) wave function will be an admixture of electronic configurations with weights proportional to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of doubly - occupied sites .",
    "unfortunately , dealing with such a state is a difficult task , and , at present , only few attempts have been pursued in this direction .",
    "@xcite on the contrary , our approach based upon backflow correlations define a many - body wave function that can be easily treated by standard monte carlo methods .",
    "most importantly , it remains accurate also for intermediate electron - electron repulsion , allowing a precise description of the physics down to the metal - insulator transition .",
    "@xcite here , we show that the energy gain due to backflow correlations in the insulating phase is mainly related to a better description of the local hopping processes changing the total numbers of holon - doublon couples .",
    "we discuss the extension of backflow correlations to long - range distances and how the behavior of the jastrow factor is affected by the presence of backflow correlations .",
    "we present the results both for one and two dimensions , with the variational wave function containing no magnetic terms .",
    "finally , we discuss also how the variational method allows us to calculate the charge gap in the insulating phase and present results for the one - dimensional case .",

    "we will consider nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor hoppings that will be respectively denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath16 in 2d and by @xmath17 and @xmath18 in 1d .",
    "we will focus our attention on the half - filled case with @xmath19 electrons on @xmath19 sites .",
    "both metallic and insulating phases can be constructed in a variational approach . in a first step , one constructs uncorrelated wave functions given by the ground state @xmath20 of a superconducting bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) hamiltonian ,  @xcite @xmath21 where both the free - band dispersion @xmath22 and the pairing amplitude @xmath23 are variational functions .",

    "the next - nearest - neighbor hopping parameters , as well as the effective chemical potential @xmath26 and the pairing fields , are variational parameters to be optimized .",
    "@xmath27 is kept fixed to set the energy scale .",
    "the correlated state @xmath28 , without backflow , is then given by @xmath29 is a density - density jastrow factor ( including the on - site gutzwiller term @xmath30 ) , with the @xmath31 being optimized independently for every distance @xmath32 .",
    "notably , within this kind of wave function , it is possible to obtain a pure ( i.e. , non - magnetic ) mott insulator by considering a sufficiently strong jastrow factor ,  @xcite i.e. , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 being the fourier transform of @xmath31 ) and a metallic state whenever @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that @xmath33 is necessary to have a vanishing quasi - particle weight in fermionic models ,  @xcite or to have a vanishing condensate fraction in bosonic models .",
    "@xcite nonetheless , much more difficult is to demonstrate by numerical simulations that such a jastrow term is sufficient to obtain exponential correlations , which are suitable for a fully gapped mott insulator .",
    "as recently shown ,  @xcite the projected bcs state @xmath28 can be rather poor for large on - site interactions , in presence of frustration . in order to overcome this limitation , a further improvement of the variational wave function",
    "is needed .",
    "one possibility ( which is discussed in the next section ) is to consider the strong - coupling approach , based upon the @xmath4-matrix expansion .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , this method can not be easily handled by quantum monte carlo simulations on large systems .",
    "however , an alternative , but somewhat related , approach may be defined in terms of backflow correlations , which is stable and accurate even for large system sizes .",
    "let us consider the limit of @xmath5 . here",
    ", there are no doublons and the wave function can be written as @xmath36 , where the full gutzwiller projector @xmath37 removes all double occupancies , while @xmath38 denotes an uncorrelated mean - field state , such as the @xmath39 state introduced in the previous section .",
    "then , the strong - coupling approach allows one to define and construct a variational wave function for the hubbard model at _ large but finite _ values of @xmath40 by latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : s_matrix }    @xmath4 can be determined by using a recursive scheme . at the lowest order in @xmath6 , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 correspond to the kinetic terms that increase and decrease the number of doubly occupied sites by one :  @xcite @xmath45 however , the wave function of eq .",
    "( [ eq : s_matrix ] ) is hard to handle ( both analytically and numerically ) , since @xmath4 is non - diagonal in the basis where the electrons have defined positions in the lattice ( in contrast to the jastrow term , which is diagonal ) . in the large-@xmath2 limit , one can further expand the exponential and obtain : @xmath46 does not contain doubly occupied sites and @xmath4 may generate at most one doublon .",
    "therefore , after the expansion of the exponent , the wave function is no longer size consistent .",
    "let us see what can be learned from this strong - coupling approach .",
    "suppose that an electronic configuration @xmath47 has no doubly occupied sites , then , since @xmath48 , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : s_exp ] ) we have that : @xmath49 on the other hand , if the configuration @xmath50 contains one doublon ( with the holon in one of its neighboring sites ) , we have that : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the ( only ) two possible configurations with no doubly occupied sites that are connected to @xmath50 by @xmath4 ; signs depend upon the convention used for labeling electronic configurations .",
    "therefore , the weight of a configuration with one doublon is related to the weight of two configurations without doublons ( times @xmath6 ) .",
    "this procedure for defining a variational wave function is exact for @xmath54 , when at most _ one _ doublon is present in the electronic configurations ; however , one is mostly interested into the case where an arbitrary number of doublons and holons are present ( relevant for the generic case with @xmath55 ) , and the straightforward generalization of this formalism becomes much more elaborated and difficult to implement in numerical calculations .",
    "as introduced in ref .  , backflow correlations modify the single - particle eigenstates @xmath56 of the mean - field hamiltonian , like for example @xmath57 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : meanfield ] ) , according to the electronic configuration on the lattice : @xmath58 where @xmath59 if the site @xmath12 is doubly occupied and is surrounded by at least one empty site , while @xmath60 in all the other cases . here @xmath61 are variational parameters to be optimized , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , with @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , the shorthand notations n.n . and n.n.n .",
    "indicate nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor sites , respectively . in this way , already the determinant part of the wave function includes correlation effects , strongly improving the accuracy of the many - body state .",
    "when backflow correlations are included in the slater determinant , the state will be denoted by @xmath65 .",
    "this is a substantial improvement with respect to jastrow factors , where electron - electron correlation is included only via a multiplicative term ( i.e. , giving a `` classical '' potential acting on the electronic configuration ) .",
    "the results for the @xmath4-matrix expansion may be compared with the ones of backflow correlations for large electron - electron interactions , namely when at most one doublon is present .",
    "indeed , whenever no doubly - occupied sites are present , we have that @xmath66 ( where we dropped the jastrow weight , since all sites are singly occupied , and it represents a multiplicative constant ) .",
    "we discuss now the case of a single doublon and note that the backflow corrections  ( [ eq : backflow ] ) are valid for both up- and down - spin orbitals .",
    "we consider here , for simplicity , only nearest - neighbor backflow terms , with parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and obtain : @xmath69,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , in analogy with the @xmath4-matrix expansion , backflow correlations act on configurations with doubly occupied sites ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) , transferring some weight to configurations without doubly - occupied sites ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the same two configurations that appear in the strong - coupling expansion ) ; in addition there is some weight also coming from configurations with one holon - doublon couple ( i.e. , the original configuration @xmath47 and a configuration where the two electrons of the doubly - occupied site have been transferred to the empty site @xmath70 ) .",
    "the signs of the second and third terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : back_largeu ] ) are the same as the ones appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : onedoublon ] ) .",
    "the relative weights of the admixture in eq .",
    "( [ eq : back_largeu ] ) is controlled by the variational parameters @xmath71 and @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , our way to define the backflow correlations is strictly related to the strong - coupling approach ; moreover , it allows us to consider many couples of holons and doublons , with a moderate computational cost , since they just re - define the slater determinant of the wave function .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the backflow wave function , on the contrary to the strong - coupling approach of eqs .",

    "<S> we show that backflow correlations in the variational wave function for the hubbard model greatly improve the previous results given by the slater - jastrow state , usually considered in this context . we provide evidence that , within this approach , it is possible to have a satisfactory connection with the strong - coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that , for the hubbard model on the lattice , backflow correlations are essentially short range , inducing an effective attraction between empty ( holons ) and doubly occupied sites ( doublons ) . in presence of frustration , </S>",
    "<S> we report the evidence that the metal to mott - insulator transition is marked by a discontinuity of the double occupancy , together with a similar discontinuity of the kinetic term that does not change the number of holons and doublons , while the other kinetic terms are continuous across the transition . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show the estimation of the charge gap , obtained by particle - hole excitations _  la feynman _ over the ground - state wave function . </S>"
