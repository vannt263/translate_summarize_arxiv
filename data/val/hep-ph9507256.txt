    "in the last years one of the most challenging problems in elementary particle physics seems to be the solution of qcd in the low energy region .",
    "the main difficulties are due to the non - perturbative effects caused by the growing effective coupling constant of the fundamental theory in the low energy limit .",
    "this prevents one from using the well - known main tool of theoretical physics  the perturbation theory .",
    "because of this , the most intriguing features of qcd , confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , still remain conceptual and practical problems .",
    "the above mentioned obstacles have initiated an increasing interest in non - perturbative methods and effective low - energy models of hadrons .",
    "the effective models are expected to mimic the behavior of qcd at low energies .",
    "the simplest purely fermionic lorentz invariant model describing spontaneous chiral symmetry breakdown is the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite .",
    "the njl lagrangean contains chirally invariant local four - fermion interaction . in its simplest su(2 )",

    "we assume that the meson fields are constrained to the chiral circle : @xmath13 where @xmath14 mev is the pion decay constant .",
    "in fact , an equivalent effective chiral quark meson theory  @xcite can be derived from the instanton model of the qcd vacuum .    in the chiral quark soliton model  @xcite based on the lagrangean ( [ newlag ] ) ( frequently referred to simply as njl model )",
    "the baryons appear as a bound state of @xmath15 valence quarks , coupled to the polarized dirac sea .",
    "actually , the baryon solution of the model is obtained in two steps . in the first step , motivated by the large @xmath15 limit",
    ", a static localized solution ( soliton ) is found by solving the corresponding equations of motion in an iterative self - consistent procedure  @xcite , assuming that the @xmath16 and @xmath12 fields have hedgehog structure .",
    "however , this hedgehog soliton does not preserve the spin and isospin . in order to describe the nucleon properties one needs nucleon states with proper spin and isospin numbers . to this end , making use of the rotational zero modes , the soliton is quantized  @xcite . within the semiclassical quantization scheme quite successful calculations have been reported for the nucleon - delta mass splitting  @xcite and axial - vector form factor  @xcite as well as some results for the nucleon electric form factors  @xcite .",
    "very recently , in the semiclassical quantization procedure important @xmath1 rotational corrections have been derived  @xcite for isovector magnetic moment as well as for the axial coupling constant .",
    "these corrections are derived in a formalism  @xcite , based on the path integral approach  @xcite .",
    "the scheme involves a time - ordering of collective operators which follows from the collective path integral .",
    "it improves considerably the theoretical values for the isovector magnetic moment , which is strongly underestimated  @xcite in the leading order .    besides its numerical success",
    ", there are also theoretical reasons why the njl model , described by lagrangean ( [ newlag ] ) , is considered as the one of the most promising effective theories describing low energy qcd phenomena .",
    "first , the model is the simplest quark model describing spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry , a basic feature of qcd .",
    "this allows to treat the pions as goldstone particles and to include familiar methods of the current algebra into the model .",
    "as for the confinement , which is absent in the model , some recent lattice qcd results for the vacuum correlation functions of hadronic currents  @xcite suggest that the confinement mechanism seems to have little impact on the light hadron structure , in particular on the nucleon and delta structure .",
    "second , there are various hints  @xcite that the njl - type lagrangean can be obtained from qcd in various low - energy approximations .",
    "it should be stressed that the large @xmath15 limit plays a prominent role in those considerations .",
    "the aim of this paper is to calculate the electromagnetic nucleon form factors within the @xmath17 chiral quark soliton model , based on the semibosonized njl - type lagrangean , where the vacuum polarization effects taken into account .",
    "the calculations done in the semiclassical quantization scheme will include the rotational @xmath1 corrections , which have been shown  @xcite to be important for the isovector magnetic moment .",
    "in the derivation of the matrix element of the electromagnetic current in the semiclassical quantization scheme not - commuting collective operators appear and the final result depends on the ordering of these operators .",
    "in fact , similar to ref .",
    "@xcite the problem of the proper ordering of the collective operators is solved in the present paper using a path - integral approach  @xcite to the semiclassical quantization , which allows a natural access to the problem .",
    "this scheme allows to calculate the nucleon electromagnetic form factors , as well as such quantities like the electric mean squared radii , the magnetic moments , the nucleon@xmath0 energy splitting , and the electric and magnetic charge distributions of the nucleon .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive general expressions for the nucleon form factors in the njl model .",
    "they are split in dirac sea and valence quark contributions both including rotational corrections , coming from the expansion of the effective action in powers of the angular velocity of the soliton .",
    "since the njl model is non - renormalizable an ultraviolet regularization , which preserves the electromagnetic gauge invariance , is introduced in section 3 .",
    "the general formalism developed in sections 2 and 3 is then applied to evaluate the nucleon electromagnetic form factors in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we present and discuss our numerical results .",
    "our main goal in this section is to derive a general formula for nucleon form factors in the njl model including rotational corrections .",
    "we start with the path integral representation for the nucleon matrix element of the corresponding quark current . after integrating out the quark fields we find that the result splits in two parts , the dirac sea and the valence quark contributions .",
    "usually the remaining integral over the meson fields is evaluated within the saddle point approximation .",
    "however , the saddle - point classical solution has a hedgehog symmetry that breaks both rotational and @xmath17 isospin symmetries . in order to restore them",
    "one has to consider a rotating soliton and to perform a functional integration over the time - dependent orientation matrix of the soliton . expanding in powers of the angular velocity up",
    "to linear order we derive rotational corrections to the nucleon form factors .",
    "a special attention is paid to the correct ordering of non - commuting collective operators describing the rotational degrees of freedom of the soliton . in this section",
    "the consideration is limited to the non - regularized case and the ultraviolet regularization is postponed till section 3 .    under the chiral circle restriction ( [ chircir ] ) we can introduce the @xmath17 chiral meson field @xmath18 and work with the euclidean lagrangean @xmath19 where the operator @xmath20 includes the euclidean time derivative @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and",

    "the experimental ratio is almost exactly reproduced for the constituent quark mass 420 mev .    in the present calculations , in contrast to the isoscalar magnetic moment the isovector one includes non - zero contributions in both leading ( @xmath199 ) and next to leading order ( @xmath1 rotational corrections ) .",
    "the enhancement due to these corrections improves considerably ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) the agreement with the experiment and resolves to a great extent the problem of strong underestimation  @xcite of both the isovector magnetic moment and the axial vector coupling constant in leading order .",
    "it is also important to note that since the @xmath1 rotational corrections have the same spin - flavor structure like the leading term they do not violate the consistency condition of dashen and manohar  @xcite derived in the large-@xmath15 of qcd .",
    "the latter means that other @xmath1 corrections ( e.g. meson loops ) should contribute to both the leading and next to leading order .    in table",
    "[ tabl2 ] we give the theoretical values of the same quantities but with the physical pion mass set to zero .",
    "the chiral limit ( @xmath200 ) mostly influences the isovector charge radius .",
    "in fact , as it should be expected  @xcite , the isovector charge radius diverges in chiral limit and our calculations with zero pion mass confirms it .",
    "it can be seen in fig.[figr6 ] , where the isovector charge radius is plotted _ vs. _ the box size @xmath83 .",
    "the dirac sea contribution to the radius grows linearly with @xmath83 and diverges as @xmath201 .",

    "the other observable strongly influenced by the chiral limit is the neutron electric form factor . for the @xmath200",
    "the discrepancy from the experiment is by almost a factor two larger than in the case @xmath202 .",
    "the other observables differ in the chiral limit by about 30% .",
    "the comparison of the values in the two tables indicate that taking the physical pion mass gives us a best fit with a much better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "in addition , in chiral limit we observe much larger contribution from the sea effects , about 50% of the total value .",
    "in section 3 we have found that the magnetic isovector form factor is the only one which includes non - zero contributions in both leading ( @xmath199 ) and next to leading order ( @xmath1 ) rotational corrections .",
    "however , the numerical calculations show that the ( @xmath1 ) rotational corrections do not affect the @xmath203-dependence ( slope ) of the form factor but rather the value at the origin , @xmath204 which is the isovector magnetic moment .",
    "it is not surprising since ( as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ isovector - magnetic - form - factor ] ) in both leading and next to leading order terms the shape of the wave functions @xmath89 determines the @xmath203-dependence of the form factor whereas the value at @xmath164 depends on the particular matrix elements included . in leading order the isovector magnetic moment",
    "is strongly underestimated  @xcite . as has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the enhancement for this quantity due to the @xmath1 corrections is of order @xmath205 and it improves considerably the agreement with experiment .",
    "however , as can be seen from table [ tabl1 ] the magnetic moments are still below the experimental value by 25 % .",
    "the isoscalar and isovector electric mean squared radii are shown in figs.[figr7],[figr8 ] as functions of the constituent quark mass .",
    "the same plot for the proton and neutron electric charge radii is given in fig.[figr9 ] .",
    "in these plots the valence and sea contributions are explicitly given ( dashed and dash - dotted lines , respectively ) .",
    "as could be expected , for the isoscalar electric charge radius the valence part is dominant ( about 85% ) , due to the fact that there is no @xmath1 rotational contributions .",
    "this is not true for the isovector electric charge radius , where the sea part contributes to about 45% of the total value ( fig.[figr7 ] ) .",
    "also , this effect can be seen at the proton and neutron charge radii ( fig.[figr9 ] ) which are linear combinations of the isoscalar and isovector ones .",
    "for proton the sea contribution is about 30% whereas for the neutron charge radius the negative sea part is dominating and the valence contribution is negligible .",
    "in addition , in fig.[figr10 ] we plot the proton and neutron charge distribution for the constituent quark mass @xmath206 mev . for the proton we have a positive definite charge distribution completely dominated by the valence contribution whereas in the case of the neutron",
    "the dirac sea is dominant . in accordance with the well accepted phenomenological picture one realizes a positive core coming from the valence quarks and a long negative tail due to the polarization of the dirac sea . using the gradient expansion the latter",
    "can be expressed in terms of the dynamical pion field  pion cloud .",
    "for completeness , in fig.[figr11 ] we present also the magnetic moment density distribution for proton and neutron for the constituent quark mass @xmath206 mev .",
    "the sea contribution becomes non - negligible for distances greater than 0.5 fm . due to the relatively large tail contribution to the magnetic moments the sea contribution to these quantities",
    "is about 30% .",
    "our numerical results support the view that the chiral quark soliton model of the su(2 ) nambu  jona - lasinio type offers relatively simple but quite successful description of some low - energy qcd phenomena and , in particular , of the nucleon electromagnetic properties . in calculations , using @xmath207 mev , @xmath208 mev and a constituent quark mass of @xmath209 mev , and no other parameters , we have obtained an overall good description for the electromagnetic form factors , the mean squared radii , the magnetic moments , and the nucleon@xmath0 splitting . the isoscalar and isovector electric radii",
    "are reproduced within 15% .",
    "the magnetic moments are underestimated by about 25% . however ,",
    "their ratio @xmath198 is almost perfectly reproduced . to this end",
    ", the account of the @xmath1 rotational corrections is decisive .",
    "the @xmath196dependence of @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 is very well reproduced up to momentum transfer of 1 gev .",
    "the only exception is the neutron form factor @xmath213 which is by a factor of two too large for @xmath214 mev@xmath215 .",
    "one should note , however , that @xmath213 is more than an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath210 and as such it is extremely sensitive to both the model approximations and the numerical methods used . here , it turns out that the agreement is noticeably worse if the chiral limit ( @xmath216 ) is used .",
    "this can be easily understood since the pion mass determines the asymptotic behavior of the pion field .",
