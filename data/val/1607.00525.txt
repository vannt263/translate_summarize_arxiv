    "a smoother coefficient @xmath5 and more regular initial data @xmath19 result in a more regular solution @xcite .    even though equations , are linear , analytical solution formulae are in general not available due to the possibly complex geometry of the domain @xmath12 , the heterogeneity of the coefficient , or boundary conditions .",
    "consequently , solutions have to be approximated numerically . among the most popular methods for the linear wave equation with inhomogeneous coefficient @xmath5 are finite difference methods and finite element methods for which an extensive stability and convergence analysis is available  @xcite .",
    "a key question is the rate at which numerical schemes converge to the exact solution as the discretization paramter goes to zero or the computational effort increases , since this allows to estimate the computational work needed to get a certain desired quality of the approximation .",
    "if the underlying solution of the equation is smooth , this generally depends on the order of the truncation error which is determined by the order of the spatial and temporal discretization , that is , the order of the underlying difference operators ( for finite difference schemes ) or the dimension of the polynomial approximation spaces ( for finite element methods ) .",
    "the smoothness of the solution again depends on the regularity of the coefficient and the initial data for the equation .",
    "if the coefficient @xmath5 and the initial data @xmath19 are smooth , say @xmath20 or @xmath21 for some large enough sobolev exponent @xmath22 , then by regularity results for the linear wave equation @xcite , the solution is also smooth , i.e. , it belongs to @xmath23 and the finite difference ( resp .",

    "accordingly , most of the numerical analysis literature on the wave equation assumes a smooth coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "however , this assumption is not always realized in practice .",
    "as noted before , the wave equation is heavily used to model seismic imaging in rock formations and other porous media ( for instance oil and gas reservoirs ) .",

    "thus , the coefficient @xmath5 is not smooth , not even continuously differentiable , see figure [ fig : coef1d ] for an illustration of coefficient @xmath5 where the rock permeability is modeled by a log - normal random field ( the figure represents a single realization of the field ) .",

    "no further regularity can be assumed on the coefficient @xmath5 representing material properties of most geophysical formations .",

    ", one is interested in designing numerical methods that can be rigorously shown to converge to the underlying weak solution .",
    "furthermore , one is also interested in obtaining a convergence rate for the discretization as the mesh parameters are refined .",
    "we remark that the issue of a convergence rate is not just of theoretical significance , it has for example profound implications on calculating complexity estimates for monte carlo and multilevel monte carlo methods ( see @xcite ) to solve the random ( uncertain ) pde that results from considering the material coefficient as a random field ( as is done in engineering practice ) .    a search through the literature revealed that there are not many results available concerning convergence rates for linear hyperbolic partial differential equations with rough coefficients . in  @xcite ,",

    "given this paucity of available results , we aim to contribute to the theory with the current paper . since our ultimate goal is proving convergence rates for multidimensional wave equations , we will start by analyzing rates for linear hyperbolic systems in one space dimension , in particular , we will consider the linear advection equation @xmath36\\times d,\\ ] ] and the linear wave equation @xmath37\\times d,\\ ] ] in one space dimension where the spatially heterogeneous coefficient @xmath38 is positive and uniformly bounded but has only little regularity , specifically , we assume @xmath39 , for some @xmath40 .",

    "equation also appears as a model for transport of pollutants in heterogeneous media , see for example  @xcite .",
    "moreover , these two models are related to mixing in turbulent flow  @xcite .    in a first part ( section [ sec : intro ] ) , we study the properties of equation under the assumption that @xmath38 is hlder continuous and propose a simple upwind scheme for the numerical approximation . we show that this scheme is stable under a linear cfl - condition and converges , and then prove a convergence rate of the scheme in @xmath47 and @xmath48 depending explicitly on the hlder regularity of the coefficient @xmath38 and the initial data . to prove the rate ,",
    "we show that the numerical approximations are approximately hlder continuous in time and use a variant of s.  n.  krukov s doubling of variables technique  @xcite combined with a type of grnwall inequality for the @xmath45-case .",
    "we conclude the section with a couple of numerical experiments that confirm that the rates are indeed quite low , but higher than the theoretically established rate .",
    "this may indicate that our estimate is not sharp .    in the second part ( section [ sec:1d ] )",
    ", we show that the techniques from section [ sec : intro ] can be used to establish a convergence rate for an upwind finite difference scheme for the first order reformulation of the linear wave equation in one space dimension for hlder continuous coefficient @xmath38 but under slightly stronger assumptions on the initial data , or given that the solution has a known modulus of continuity . again",
    ", we conduct a couple of numerical experiments and observe that the experimental rates are close to the theoretically derived ones .",
    "we conclude by summarizing the results and suggesting further research directions in section [ sec : conc ] .",

    "acoustic waves that propagate in a heterogeneous medium , for instance an oil and gas reservoir , are modeled using the linear wave equation with a variable material coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "standard finite difference and finite element approximations converge to the solution as the mesh is refined . a rate of convergence for these approximations can be obtained based on the assumption that the underlying solution is smooth enough .",
    "this requires enough smoothness of the material coefficient ( wave speed ) .",
    "however in many practical situations of interest such as seismic wave imaging and hydrocarbon exploration , the material coefficient is not smooth , not even continuously differentiable .",
    "moreover , the material coefficient ( rock permeability ) is usually modeled by a log - normal random field . path - wise realizations of such fields are at most hlder continuous .",
    "thus , the design of numerical schemes that can approximate wave propagation in hlder continuous media is a necessary first step in the efficient solution of the underlying uncertain pde with a log - normal distributed material coefficient @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of rigorous numerical analysis results for discretizations of the wave equation with such rough coefficients apart from the works  @xcite which require the coefficient to be in @xmath382 for some @xmath383 $ ] .",
    "the current paper is therefore an attempt to design robust numerical approximations for the one - dimensional transport and the wave equation with rough , i.e. , only hlder continuous coefficients . for low enough hlder exponent ,",
    "this regularity requirement is less than the one in  @xcite , and also our assumptions on the regularity of the solution are weaker .",

    "the numerical experiments demonstrate the near sharpness of this rate .",
    "we also show rates of convergence under the assumption that the numerical approximations have lower moduli of continuity , however , in this case , we can not prove that the numerical approximations actually inherit those .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion on possible limitations and future extensions of our methods :    * we consider finite difference discretizations in the current paper .",
    "the formal order of accuracy of our three - point finite difference schemes is one .",
    "one can argue that analogous to linear hyperbolic systems with smooth coefficients , one can obtain higher rates of convergence by designing schemes with a larger stencil ( a higher formal order of accuracy ) .",
    "we find that prospect unlikely to hold in practice on account of the lack of smoothness of the coefficient .",
    "furthermore , the irregularities of the coefficient are not localized .",
    "hence , one can not expect any localization of singularities in the solution and its derivatives .",
    "this is in marked contrast to nonlinear systems of conservation laws where discontinuities such as shocks and contact discontinuities separate smooth parts of the flow .",
    "thus , high - resolution finite difference schemes perform better than low order schemes for conservation laws .",
    "such a situation does not hold for wave propagation in a rough medium .",
    "we expect that the low - order schemes presented here are not only simple but also optimal in this case .",
    "* we present the analysis only in one space dimension and for uniform grids .",
    "the extension of the finite difference scheme to the two and three dimensional wave equation is straightforward , however , it is not easy to show that the solution computed in this way has a modulus of continuity , which is fundamental to obtaining convergence rates using our technique .",
    "in fact , we do not know currently if the approximations do have a modulus of continuity . obtaining more insight into",
    "the regularity of the approximations is one of the objectives of our current research efforts .",
    "we would furthermore like to extend the method and convergence analysis to unstructured grids . *",
    "the numerical experiments for the transport equation ( section [ ssec : exprates ] ) suggest that the rate from theorem [ lem : ratetransport ] may not be sharp .",
    "consequently , we plan to experiment more in order to find out if the rate is sharp or not , and otherwise try to improve the estimate .",
    "* we restrict ourselves to acoustic wave propagation in rough media in this paper",

    "the extension of these methods to such problems will be considered in a forthcoming paper .",
    "another possible direction of research would be to prove a rate of convergence for numerical methods that approximate electromagnetic wave propagation in heterogeneous media .",
