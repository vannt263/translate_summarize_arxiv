    "the recent experimental observation of a signature of one - dimensional ( 1d ) transport in 30 nm wide graphene ribbons  @xcite certainly motivated the theoretical investigation of 1d systems . a very interesting class of q1 dm",
    "are the ones where a lattice distortion develops spontaneously with the appearance of a gap @xmath0 , rendering the material an insulator .",
    "this is the mechanism of the _ peierls transition _ , which has been observed experimentally in various q1 dm .",
    "probably , one of the most well - known q1 dm that exhibits this phenomenon is _",
    "trans_-polyacetylene ( tpa ) .",
    "this polymer is a 1d chain of @xmath1 groups with alternating single and double bonds , having one electron per site . in the tight binding approximation",
    ", tpa would be a metal .",
    "however , the interaction of the electrons with the lattice ( also known as the spontaneous peierls dimerization ) is such that the energy gain in the system is always larger that the energy investment for distorting the lattice . as a consequence",
    ", polyacetylene is an insulator . after doping , and the consequent vanishing of the gap at an experimentally measured critical doping concentration @xmath2  @xcite ,",
    "the conductivity of tpa is enormously increased , presenting metal - like properties  @xcite .    although we shall refer to _ trans_@xmath3 throughout the paper , due to the large amount of data on this material , the main results obtained here are robust and",
    "can be applied to any q1 dm possessing the same dimerized structure of _",
    "trans_@xmath3 for which a field theory model is suitable to be employed  @xcite .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction in _",
    "trans_@xmath4 is described by the discrete su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) hamiltonian  @xcite , and its continuum version , the takayama  lin - liu  maki ( tlm ) hamiltonian  @xcite . the tlm model is a relativistic field theory with two - flavor dirac fermions that , with a doping equal to or greater than @xmath5 , have linear dispersion relations with a fermi velocity @xmath6 , which is of the order of the velocity of the dirac fermions in graphene  @xcite . employing the gross - neveu ( gn ) model  @xcite , that can be properly identified with the tlm model , as an effective field theory model for describing the insulator - metal phase transition in polyacetylene  @xcite",
    ", there has been found a very good agreement with the experimental value , @xmath7  @xcite , where @xmath8 ( = 2 for tpa ) is the number of spin degrees of freedom of the ( delocalized ) @xmath9 electrons , @xmath10 is the planck s constant divided by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the fermi wavenumber , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 for tpa ) is the lattice ( equilibrium ) spacing between the @xmath17 coordinates of successive @xmath18 radicals in the undimerized structure , and @xmath19 ( @xmath0 @xmath20 for tpa ) is the critical chemical potential at which the gn model undergoes a first - order phase transition to a symmetry restored ( zero gap ) phase  @xcite .",
    "regarding our choice of using a continuum model , a few comments are pertinent here .",
    "the tlm model can be derived from the ssh model by expanding its hamiltonian about the fermi surface and keeping terms only to lowest order in @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the electronic correlation length .",
    "this is fulfilled for the materials we are interested in and will be described by the tlm ( gn ) model , for which @xmath23 . besides , the clear advantages of employing continuum models such as the tlm ( or gn ) are the analytical solutions that they provide and the fact that field theory methods are suitable for the calculation of the effective potential , which is appropriate for the analysis of the phase structure of the model , as in this work . on the other hand ,",
    "the disadvantages are that continuum models with relativistic dispersion relations have an electronic spectrum that is unbounded below , and that the acoustic modes are lost in the continuum limit .",
    "the first problem is resolved by adopting a certain energy cutoff , and the second , if only terms to next order in @xmath21 are kept  @xcite .    in @xcite the zero temperature phase diagram of 1d tpa under asymmetric doping , defined as an imbalance between the chemical potentials of the electrons with the two possible spin orientations (  up \" @xmath24 , and  down \" @xmath25 ) introduced in the system by the doping process , has been studied .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite , the chemical potentials asymmetry between the @xmath26 and @xmath27 electrons can be achieved experimentally by the actuation of an external static magnetic field @xmath28 on the polyacetylene wire , which breaks the spin-1/2 _ su  _ ( 2 ) symmetry . in @xcite ,",
    "the continuous model that describes the electron - phonon interactions in tpa has been introduced and the magnetization , the critical magnetic field @xmath29 at which there is a quantum phase transition to a fully polarized ( magnetized ) phase , and the magnetic susceptibility at zero temperature , within the field theory approach , have been obtained .    in this paper , we study the thermal effects on the magnetic properties of peierls distorted q1 dm and verify the possibility of the existence of this fully polarized phase at finite temperature .",
    "the mean - field finite temperature phase diagram for the field theory model employed is obtained .",
    "the tricritical points of the second - order transition curves of the gap parameter and magnetization are explicitly calculated by considering both homogeneous and inhomogeneous @xmath30 condensates .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is the demonstration of the  stationarity \" of the tricritical point of the second - order transition line of the gap parameter under the the influence of an external ( constant ) zeeman magnetic field . in other words , in a peierls distorted q1 dm under the influence of an external zeeman magnetic field , the tricritical point obtained considering homogeneous condensates remains at the same location when inhomogeneous @xmath30 condensates are taken into account .",

    "ii we introduce the model lagrangian describing polyacetylene . in section",
    "iii the temperature dependent renormalized effective potential is presented . in this section",
    "we obtain an analytical expression for the effective potential at high temperature , as well as the chemical potentials dependent gap equation and the critical temperature at which the gap vanishes . besides this",
    ", the tricritical points of the second - order transition lines of the gap parameter and magnetization are explicitly calculated .",
    "the temperature dependent magnetic properties of peierls distorted q1 dm are also obtained in this section . in the summary we present the conclusions .",

    "we have shown that for the particular case of tpa , in order to have a fully polarized organic conductor at finite temperature it would be necessary to have a very high critical magnetic field , namely @xmath29 . however , for a given magnetic field below @xmath29 , partial polarizations ( magnetizations ) can be realized experimentally , provided the temperatures are kept outside the  @xmath225 \" region of fig .",
    "it is worth noting that , according to eq .",
    "( [ cmf ] ) , for other 1d systems with a smaller critical chemical potential or with a greater effective @xmath55-factor , a smaller ( attainable ) critical magnetic field necessary for a fully polarization of the q1 dm would be found . as a final remark",
    ", it would also be very interesting to study the transport properties of the asymmetrically doped peierls distorted q1 dm at zero and finite temperature , employing the field theory approach .",
