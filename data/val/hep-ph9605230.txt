    "the 3 - 3 - 1 models of electroweak interactions@xcite , based on the su(3)@xmath0u(1)@xmath1 gauge group , predict some new particles which lead to new physics and interesting phenomenology .",
    "in particular , these models predict no very high new mass scales , in such a way that they can be confirmed or ruled out in a near future  @xcite .",
    "they belong to a type of gauge models which has the su(2)@xmath2u(1 ) electroweak doublet contained in a su(3)@xmath2u(1 ) triplet .",
    "the su(3)@xmath0u(1)@xmath1 @xmath3 su(2)@xmath0u(1)@xmath4 break scale is estimated by running @xmath5 towards large values , which give the bound @xmath6 tev  @xcite .",
    "this type of models , that includes the unified ones and chiral extensions of the standard model , is characterized by su(2 ) doublets @xmath7 of vector and scalar gauge bosons which carry lepton number l = 2 ( dileptons ) .",
    "the dileptons mediate processes which violate individual lepton numbers .",
    "the total lepton number ( @xmath8 ) is conserved .",
    "there are some aspects which turn the 3 - 3 - 1 models a very interesting extension of the standard model@xcite .",
    "the main two of them are the prediction about the family number ( which must be multiple of the color number ) and the bound for the weinberg angle ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "experimentally an interesting feature is that the mass scale of the vector dileptons can be as low as the weak scale .",
    "thus , the lower bound on these masses can be obtained from the available data of the weak processes such as muon decay , low energy neutral current experiments , bhabha scattering , etc@xcite .    in this work",
    "we discuss the higgs potential of the 3 - 3 - 1 models at the tree level .",
    "the phenomenology of the scalar sector of the 3 - 3 - 1 models is not studied yet . in the model of refs .",
    "@xcite , the minimal number of higgs multiplets required in order to generate all fermion masses is four : three triplets and one sextet .",
    "the latter is necessary in order to get the masses of the charged leptons .",
    "however , if we assume the presence of heavy leptons@xcite the sextet is not necessary .",
    "also , if a right - handed singlet neutrino is added , it is possible to generate the right mass spectrum of the charged lepton through radiative corrections without introducing the sextet of higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "thus , we can consider the vev of the sextet rather small ( a few gev ) relative to the vev s of the triplets which are @xmath10 100 gev ( two ) and @xmath10 ( 1  3 ) tev ( one ) .",
    "so , the three triplet models can be a good approximation for the scalar sector of the 3 - 3 - 1 models .    here",
    "we study both , the three triplet and the three triplet and one sextet models .",
    "each of them has neutral cp - even and cp - odd scalar bosons as well as singly charged and doubly charged ones . in this type of models there",
    "can be charged scalar masses of the same order ( or smaller ) than the neutral scalar ones . in the approximation which we are using here",
    "it is always possible to identify one of the higgs bosons with the scalar of the minimal su(2)@xmath11u(1)@xmath4 model .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the higgs potentials of the models , presenting the masses and eigenstates for the two 3 - 3 - 1 models which are considered here . in sec .",
    "3 we summarize our results .",
    "the details of the 3 - 3 - 1 models were already pointed out in several works ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore",
    ", we write below only the scalar fields .",
    "the scalar sectors which are considered here are the minimal ones .",

    "the @xmath38 @xmath39 fields lead to three cp - even ( one cp - odd ) physical scalar bosons",
    ". the exact form of the cp - even mass and eigenstates are troublesome .",
    "thus , we will give the masses and eigenstates of this sector in an approximate form and for clearing this point we will consider this approximation in some detail .",
    "the square mass matrix coming from the @xmath38 fields reads as @xmath40 in the @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 basis .",
    "here we have already imposed the constraints due to the non - linearity of the shifted potential in the @xmath38 and @xmath44 fields and we have not considered phases in the vev s . a natural approximation is to impose @xmath45 ( this also avoids a new mass scale beyond @xmath46 in the model ) and to maintain only terms of higher order in @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ cpparmass ] ) .",
    "but this results in one zero mass ( h@xmath47 ) and two massive physical states ( h@xmath48 and h@xmath49 ) with masses @xmath50 associated with the approximate eigenstates    @xmath51    thus , the former eigenstate ( h@xmath47 ) must be a _ light _",
