    "superstring theory has been investigated intensively since it is the only known consistent theory describing quantum gravity . in recent years , important aspects of superstring theory , which are closely related to string duality ,",
    "have been revealed and d - branes play important roles in these developments .",
    "while d - branes can be treated as black - brane solutions in supergravity theory , effective field theory on d - branes is given by super yang - mills theory .",
    "the fact that we can deal with d - branes in two ways implies a duality between supergravity theory ( or superstring theory ) and supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "this duality is called as @xmath4 correspondence @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) and the most famous example is @xmath5 correspondence .",
    "let us consider large @xmath6 d3-branes .",
    "if we take the near horizon limit , corresponding supergravity solution becomes @xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand , effective field theory on d - branes is given by @xmath8 @xmath9 super yang - mills theory .",
    "therefore , supergravity on @xmath7 is supposed to be dual to @xmath8 @xmath9 super yang - mills theory . because the region where supergravity limit is valid corresponds to strong coupling region of super yang - mills theory , it is expected to understand some non - perturbative aspects of super yang - mills theory by using classical supergravity theory .",
    "for this reason , @xmath5 correspondence has been investigated by many authors .",
    "it is natural to expect that there is a correspondence beyond supergravity level .",
    "however , it is difficult to quantize superstrings on @xmath7 because of the existence of rr - charges .",
    "recently , an important progress has been made on this aspect .",
    "it was found in @xcite that there is a maximally supersymmetric background with rr - flux in type iib supergravity in addition to the flat minkowski space and the @xmath7 background .",
    "this background is called as maximally supersymmetric pp - wave background and it was shown in @xcite that this background is obtained by so - called penrose limit @xcite of @xmath7 background .",
    "moreover , it was realized that superstring theory on the pp - wave background with rr - flux can be quantized by using green - schwarz formalism in the light - cone gauge @xcite .",
    "motivated by these facts , the authors of @xcite applied the `` penrose limit '' to the @xmath5 correspondence .",
    "they have shown that the penrose limit of superstring theory on @xmath7 corresponds to the subsector of `` almost bps states '' with large r - charges in @xmath8 super yang - mills theory and identified stringy excitations with single trace operators .",
    "the other famous example is @xmath0 correspondence .",
    "this is the correspondence between superstring theory on @xmath10 ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) and two dimensional superconformal field theory on a symmetric orbifold @xcite .",
    "the correspondence is related to d1/d5 system , which is the configuration of @xmath11 d5-branes wrapped on a small @xmath12 and @xmath13 d1-branes put parallel to the extra @xmath14 dimensions .",
    "since d1/d5 system was used for the microscopic description of black holes @xcite , the investigation of @xmath0 correspondence may give insights to black hole physics .",
    "in the ir limit , effective field theory on the two dimensional d - brane configuration is believed to be given by @xmath15 supersymmetric non - linear sigma model on the symmetric orbifold @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the symmetric group of @xmath6 elements .",
    "the near horizon geometry of d1/d5 system becomes @xmath10 , and hence superstring theory on @xmath10 has been conjectured to be dual to superconformal field theory on @xmath18 .",
    "there are many configurations related to d1/d5 system by u - duality and in this thesis we concentrate on f1/ns5 system ( the system with @xmath13 fundamental strings and @xmath11 ns5-branes ) , which is s - dual to d1/d5 system .",
    "the near horizon geometry of f1/ns5 system can be described by superstring theory on @xmath10 with nsns - flux .",
    "this superstring theory can be written in terms of @xmath19 wzw models , and hence we can quantize this system .",
    "the superstring theory is dual to superconformal field theory on @xmath18 and the correspondence has attracted much attention since it can be examined beyond supergravity approximation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the important tests of this duality is the comparison of spectrum .",
    "there is a moduli space in the dual cft and it is difficult to analyze spectrum at general moduli point . since bps states do not depend on the deformation of moduli parameter , we can use bps spectrum at the orbifold point , where we can obtain general spectrum by using the orbifold theory technique @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can obtain bps spectrum and compare the supergravity modes of superstring theory .",
    "bps states with small r - charge are explicitly identified in @xcite and higher r - charged bps states are also reproduced successfully in @xcite by making use of the spectral flow symmetry on the @xmath20 string theory @xcite . however , it is still difficult to investigate general spectrum other than bps states .    in order to compare more general spectrum",
    ", we apply a penrose limit to @xmath0 correspondence @xcite .",
    "the penrose limit of @xmath1 with nsns - flux becomes 6 dimensional pp - wave background with nsns - flux and superstring theory on this background can be described by a generalization of nappi - witten model @xcite .",
    "this model was investigated in a different context by several authors @xcite and it can be quantized by the current algebra approach @xcite and by the sigma model approach @xcite . taking a penrose limit corresponds to concentrating on almost bps states with very large r - charges in the dual cft , where we can use spectrum at the orbifold point in this limit .",
    "we show that stringy states can be embedded in the hilbert space of the symmetric orbifold theory .",
    "the other works on the penrose limit of @xmath0 correspondence are given in @xcite .",
    "the organization of this thesis is given as follows . in section [ adsbmn ] , we first review the @xmath5 correspondence .",
    "then , we see what the penrose limit is and how we apply the limit to the @xmath5 correspondence . in section [ nsnspenrose ] ,",
    "we begin with the @xmath0 correspondence and then apply the penrose limit to it . after explaining that a generalization of nappi - witten model appears in the penrose limit of @xmath10 , we review the nappi - witten group ( and lie algebra ) and quantize this model by the sigma model approach in the light - cone gauge . in section [ nsnsppwave ] ,",
    "we quantize superstring theory on this pp - wave background by using the current algebra approach in the covariant gauge and obtain hilbert space by explicitly constructing ddf operators . in section [ compare ] , we first review superconformal field theory on the symmetric orbifold @xmath21 and then compare ( almost ) bps spectrum with string spectrum on the pp - wave background",
    ". then we comment on the case with rr - flux in subsection [ rr ] .",
    "we also discuss a extension to the case of @xmath22 and we use @xmath23 as a solvable case of @xmath3 . ] in section [ t^4/z_2 ] and we conclude this thesis in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the notation of the gamma matrices is summarized in appendix [ gamma ] .",
    "the space - time super pp - wave algebra is constructed by using the contraction of the super @xmath24 algebra in appendix [ stss ] . in appendix [ ks ] , we also investigate space - time supersymmetry on pp - waves with nsns - flux by examining killing spinors .",
    "in particular , we show that there are 24 supersymmetries in the @xmath25 background .",
    "before examining @xmath0 correspondence , we first review @xmath5 correspondence in next subsection in order to show the general concept of @xmath4 correspondence . after explaining penrose limit in subsection [ gueven ]",
    ", we apply the penrose limit to the both sides of @xmath5 correspondence and we explicitly construct single trace operators in super yang - mills theory corresponding to states of superstrings in subsection [ bmn ] .      as we mentioned in introduction , @xmath4 correspondence was deduced from the fact that there are two ways to describe d - branes .",
    "one is the supergravity or superstring description and the other is the super yang - mills description .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that there is a correspondence between a supergravity or superstring theory and a super yang - mills theory .",
    "the concrete example is given by maldacena @xcite as @xmath4 correspondence .",
    "although we concentrate on @xmath0 correspondence in this thesis , we first overview @xmath5 correspondence in order to see the general concept of @xmath4 correspondence .",

    "-branes are @xmath26 dimensional hypersurfaces and open strings are stretched between the branes . ]",
    "open strings have their ends and we have to assign some boundary conditions to the fields at the ends .",
    "the conditions consistent with the equations of motion are given by neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "let us assign the neumann boundary condition for @xmath26 coordinates and the dirichlet boundary conditions for @xmath27 coordinates .",
    "more precisely , we assign @xmath28 we have assumed the flat background and we use @xmath29 as the coordinates of world - sheet",
    ". the open strings can move only along @xmath26 dimensional hypersurface and the hypersurface is called as d@xmath30-brane . @xmath6",
    "d - branes can be described by open strings with @xmath31 chan - paton factors at their ends . in the limit that the string length @xmath32",
    ", only the massless excitations of open strings remain and low energy effective theory on @xmath6 d@xmath33-branes becomes @xmath34 super yang - mills theory . in @xmath35 case ,",
    "the effective theory is given by 4 dimensional @xmath8 super yang - mills theory .",
    "we can describe d - branes also in terms of supergravity .",
    "the supergravity solution corresponding to multiple d@xmath30-branes can be constructed @xcite and for @xmath6 d@xmath33-branes it is given by @xmath36 supported by nontrivial 5-form rr - field strength .",
    "the string coupling is denoted as @xmath37 . in the super yang - mills description , there are two decoupling sectors ; one is the super yang - mills theory on d - branes and the other is the supergravity theory on flat background . in the supergravity description ,",
    "we have also two decoupling regions ; one is the region near d - branes and the other is the region away from d - branes . in order to extract the information at the region near d - branes ,",
    "we take the near horizon limit of d3-brane solution ( [ d3-brane ] ) . by taking the limit @xmath38 , the geometry becomes @xmath7 @xmath39 since the supergravity theory on the flat background away from the d - branes are the same in the both descriptions , the super yang - mills theory on d3-branes",

    "the @xmath40 space has a codimension one boundary and the dual cft is believed to live in the 4 dimensional boundary .",
    "one evidence of the conjecture is the correspondence of symmetry .",
    "4 dimensional @xmath8 super yang - mills theory is known to be a superconformal field theory . the combination of @xmath41 dimensional poincar symmetry , dilatation symmetry and special conformal symmetry is described by @xmath42 , and there is @xmath43 r - symmetry in @xmath8 supersymmetric theory .",
    "the isometry of @xmath7 space is also given by @xmath44 and precisely reproduce the symmetry of @xmath8 superconformal field theory .    in the large @xmath6 @xmath34 yang - mills theory ,",
    "effective coupling is given by t hooft coupling @xmath45 . by using the relation @xmath46 and ( [ d3-brane ] ) ,",
    "the perturbative region is given by @xmath47 on the other hand , the supergravity approximation is valid when @xmath48 thus we may investigate super yang - mills theory at strong coupling region @xmath49 by using the supergravity on @xmath7 .    in a conformal field theory ,",
    "basic objects are operators . in the context of @xmath4 correspondence ,",

    "the left hand side is the generating function of correlation function and the right hand side is the partition function of superstring theory on @xmath7 .",
    "this equation implies that the operator @xmath53 in the conformal field theory corresponds to the field @xmath52 in the superstring theory .",
    "in fact , it is shown that there is a one - to - one correspondence between kaluza - klein modes compactified on @xmath54 in the supergravity and single trace bps operators in the super yang - mills theory . in the cft side",
    ", we obtain a correlation function by differentiating source currents @xmath51 . in the ads side",
    ", the correlation function corresponds to s - matrix for the fields @xmath52 .",
    "for example , 4-point functions of operators @xmath55 in the super yang - mills theory can be calculated by feynman diagrams with the 4 external fields @xmath52 as in figure [ fig : benz ] .          in @xcite penrose pointed out that pp - wave ( plane fronted wave with parallel rays ) geometry is realized as a limit of any geometry . furthermore , this limiting procedure is generalized in @xcite to supergravity on ten or eleven dimensional lorentzian space - time @xmath56 .",

    "it may be worthwhile to comment on how such discrepancy is removed if assuming fractional string excitations .",
    "these excitations do not exist in the perturbative string spectrum and may be at least explained in the s - dual picture as discussed in section [ d1d5 ] .",
    "the existence of @xmath683 ns5 leads to fractional strings with tension @xmath684 , where @xmath468 represents the tension of fundamental string .",
    "if we measure the radii of @xmath153 by the unit of string length @xmath685 , namely , @xmath686 , the momenta ( [ t4 momenta ] ) becomes @xmath687 for the fractional strings , we should replace the string length @xmath688 with @xmath689 .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath690 and the extra factor @xmath691 completely compensates the spectrum of missing states .",
    "as we saw in the last subsection , there are many missing states in the string side .",
    "this is because the superstring theory is compared with the supersymmetric sigma model at the orbifold point , which is a different moduli point from the one of the dual cft .",
    "the dual cft can be obtain by deforming from the orbifold point and we expect that almost bps states with large r - charge are not sensitive to the deformation . however , the dual cft is at a singular moduli point , so this expectation is too naive .",

    "one way to remove this difference is to deform the superstring theory in order to include some non - perturbative excitations as mentioned before .",
    "the other way is to deform the symmetric orbifold theory by using the corresponding marginal operator . in our case",
    ", we do not know how to deform the theory from the orbifold limit , but in the case with rr - flux , the corresponding deformation is conjectured in @xcite and the spectra of two theories are compared in @xcite by making use of the deformation . in order to clarify the point , we study the correspondence between superstrings on 6 dimensional pp - waves with rr - flux and non - linear sigma model on a resolution of @xmath21 @xcite in this subsection .",

    "it was conjectured in @xcite that the general modes of four bosons and four fermions in the light - cone spectrum correspond to @xmath695 they reproduces the first order of the spectrum ( [ 6ppspectrum ] ) .",
    "we should notice that these operators correspond to the states missing in our analysis since now we take the limit of @xmath696 .",
    "for this reason , we can not compare this result with the previous one .    in order to see the next order",

    "we choose @xmath713 because @xmath713 is related to the @xmath714 and @xmath715 charges and @xmath712 is related to the charges of @xmath716-branes wrapped on some two - cycles of @xmath153 . in summary , we use the following marginal deformation @xmath717 in @xcite it was proposed that @xmath718 and a heuristic explanation was given .",
    "in fact , it was shown in @xcite that we can reproduce the first non - trivial order of the spectrum ( [ 6ppspectrum ] ) by using the marginal deformation .",
    "in this section , we extend our previous analysis to the correspondence between superstring theory on @xmath721 background and superconformal field theory on the symmetric orbifold @xmath722 .",
    "the general k3 surface can be obtained by resolving the singularity of @xmath23 and we investigate the case of the orbifold @xmath23 as a solvable example of @xmath3 surface .",

    "this fact leads us to a unique r - r bps state ( per each twisted sector ) , which is explicitly written as @xmath742 in this way , we have found the 16 r - r bps states in the twisted sectors for each @xmath30 and @xmath476 .",
    "they correspond to the blow - up modes of @xmath23 orbifold and reproduce the cohomology ring of @xmath3 together with the contributions from the untwisted sector .",
