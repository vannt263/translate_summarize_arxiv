    "the interaction of cosmic rays ( cr ) with interstellar material is a powerful probe of the spectrum , and consequently of the origin , of galactic cr .",
    "cr particles ionize the interstellar atoms and molecules , and the ionization rates can be inferred from the abundance studies of different species , such as @xmath8 ( mccall et al 2003 ; indriolo et al .",
    "2007 , goto et al . 2008 ) .",
    "they also spallate interstellar nuclei such as c , n , and o , to create light - element isotopes of li , be and b ( reeves et al . 1970 ; meneguzzi et al . 1971 ) .",
    "crs also excite nuclear states of certain nuclei and produce gamma - ray lines , as well as produce gamma - rays from pion decay after interacting with interstellar protons ( meneguzzi & reeves 1975 ; * issa & wolfendale 1981 * ) .",
    "these interactions provide a method of probing the spectrum of galactic crs at low energy where direct observations suffer from the effect of solar modulation . since these interactions depend on known cross - sections and an assumed extrapolation of the cr spectrum to low energies ,",
    "such studies have yielded valuable constraints on the low energy crs .",
    "the observed light element abundances have been used in this regard ( e.g. , meneguzzi et al .",
    "1971 ; vangioni - flam et al . 1996",
    "; kneller et al . 2003 ) , as well as gamma - ray lines ( meneguzzi & reeves 1975 ; ramaty et al . 1979 ; cass et al .",
    "1995 ; fields et al .",
    "1996 ; tatischeff & kiener 2004 ) , in addition to ionization rates ( hayakawa et al 1961 ; spitzer & tomasko 1968 ; nath & biermann 1994 ; webber 1998 ) .",
    "the observed determination of hydrogen ionization rate in diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) @xmath9 ranges between a few @xmath10 s@xmath11 to a few @xmath12 s@xmath11 , based on the abundance measurements of various species such as @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( black & dalgarno 1977 ; van dishoeck & black 1986 ; federman et al .",
    "these inferred rates however depend strongly on various assumptions such as that of the background uv radiation field .",
    "it has been shown that a cosmic ray spectrum with a low energy cutoff @xmath15 mev can explain the observed rates ( spitzer & tomasko 1968 ; nath & biermann 1994 ) . for ionization of molecular hydrogen , the standard conversion rate of @xmath16 ( glassgold & langer 1974 ) then predicted @xmath17 s@xmath11 .",
    "the observed value of @xmath18 in molecular cloud cores however ranged between @xmath19 s@xmath11 ( caselli et al .",
    "1998 ) , with the values in high density cloud cores being @xmath18 a few times @xmath10 s@xmath11 ( van der tak & van dishoeck 2000 ) .",
    "recently , a high ionization rate ( @xmath20 s@xmath11 ) has been determined in diffuse clouds through the abundance measurement of @xmath21 ( mccall et al 1998 ; mccall et al 2003 ; indriolo et al 2007 , goto et al .",
    "the simplicity of reactions involving @xmath21 makes this a robust determination .",
    "there appears to be a range of observed molecular ionization rates from diffuse clouds with low molecular content to that in dense clouds .",
    "gerin et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) and neufeld et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) found an ionization rate of @xmath22 s@xmath11 in diffuse clouds with low molecular content ( @xmath23 ) , whereas indriolo et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) have found an ionization rate as large as @xmath24 s@xmath11 near the supernovae remnant ic 443 .",
    "the contrast between the low ionization rate in molecular cloud cores and the high rate in diffuse clouds can be reconciled by either postulating that crs are inhibited in dense molecular clouds by some plasma processes , or that there is an additional low energy component in the diffuse component of crs which can not penetrate the dense cloud cores ( padovani et al 2009 ; indriolo et al .",
    "recently neronov et al .",
    "( 2012 ; hereafter referred to as nst12 ) have determined a spectrum of galactic cr protons down to a kinetic energy of @xmath25 gev , using the observed gamma ray emission from nearby molecular clouds at the gould s belt , and normalizing the flux at high energy ( @xmath0 gev ) to the flux determined by pamela .",
    "they found that in order to explain the observed gamma ray spectrum , the cr proton spectrum requires a spectral break around @xmath26 gev , below which it becomes shallow .",
    "the low energy shape of the spectrum derived by nst12 is interesting with regard to the above discussion of high ionization rate @xmath18 in that the low energy flux is substantially enhanced above the flux extrapolated from high energies .",
    "nst12 interpreted the shape of the low energy spectrum as being due to the interaction of crs with interstellar material in the last @xmath27 yr while traversing a distance of @xmath25 kpc from gould s belt . in this paper , we suggest another possibility , that the break arises from a combination of ( a ) the source spectrum being a power - law in momentum , and ( b ) the dominance of convective loss over diffusion at low energies .",
    "we then extrapolate this spectrum down to a low energy cutoff below which we assume the cr flux to be negligible , and compare the predicted ionization rate with the average observed galactic ionization rate .",
    "becker et al .",
    "( 2011 ) recently considered the ionization rate by crs in molecular clouds ( mcs ) close to supernova remnants ( snrs ) which are believed to accelerate crs .",
    "they extrapolated the theoretically predicted cr spectrum from shock acceleration mechanism , down to mev energies , and calculated the predicted ionization rate as a function of a low energy cutoff , which they used to predict abundance of ( and emission line strengths from ) species such h@xmath28 . in a related paper ,",
    "schuppan et al . (",
    "2012 ) considered a few mcs associated with snrs , and determined the cr spectrum from the observed gamma - ray spectrum , assuming a break at @xmath29 gev and then going down to a low energy cutoff of order @xmath30 mev .",
    "then they calculated the corresponding ionization rate in the mcs , which they found to be larger than the galactic average in a few cases .",
    "our line of approach is different from these .",
    "we adopt the spectrum of crs determined by nst12 as the average galactic cr spectrum , and calculate the average ionization rate , which we compare with the observed average ionization rate and discuss the possible low energy cutoff for the average galactic cr flux .",
    "since this cr spectrum is different from the ones adopted by recent authors , with a spectral break at @xmath31 gev and with a steeper spectral index between @xmath32 and @xmath33 gev , the corresponding ionization rate can not be easily translated from other works .",
    "our goal here is therefore to consider the average galactic cr flux and compute its ionization rate and compare with the ionization rate in molecular clouds _ not _ associated with snrs .",
    "the cr spectrum derived by nst12 has a spectral index @xmath34 above a break at @xmath35 gev , and a spectral index @xmath36 .",
    "the authors state that including a component of bremsstrahlung to the gamma - ray emission reduces the low energy spectral index to @xmath37 .",
    "the inverse compton contribution is likely to be negligible if there is no star forming region in the mc .",
    "gabici , aharonian & casanova ( 2009 ) have estimated that inverse compton loss becomes significant only if there is an ob association with a total output of @xmath38 erg / s located in the mc . in this case of mcs considered by nst12 , there are no snrs associated with them , and we assume that inverse compton loss is not significant . after inferring the spectral indices from gamma ray emission , nst12 normalizes the cr spectrum with the high energy measurement @xmath0 gev with pamela ( adrinai et al .",
    "we note that the cr spectrum inferred at high energy ( @xmath39 gev ) by nst12 , with spectral index of @xmath40 is consistent with * or close to * that measured by different experiments . for example , pamela finds a spectral index of @xmath41 for protons in the range of @xmath42 gev ( adriani et al .",
    "* however * ams measured an index of @xmath43 at @xmath44 gev ( aguilar et al . 2002 ) , bess an index of @xmath45 at @xmath46 hundred gev ( haino et al .",
    "2004 ) , and cream measured an index of @xmath47 between @xmath48 tev ( yoon et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the expected spectrum of crs from diffusive shock acceleration is a power - law in momentum ( @xmath49 ) ( e.g , bell 1978 ; drury 83 ; blandford & eichler 1987 and references therein ) . although at high energies the corresponding spectral index in energy is the same as that for momentum , since @xmath50 , there is expected to be a break in the energy spectrum at a few gev , with a different spectral index for the low energy crs , for which one should use @xmath51 instead of the approximation of @xmath52 .",
    "we show in figure 1 that a spectrum of @xmath53 shows a break in the spectrum in kinetic energy at a few gev , with the low energy spectral index being @xmath54 , and recovering the index of @xmath55 at higher energies .",
    "* the figure shows that the energy spectrum changes at @xmath56 , or @xmath57 gev , that lies in the range of measurement of nst12 ( @xmath58 gev ) , and is comparable to the lower ( 1@xmath59 ) error margin of the break energy @xmath32 ( @xmath60 gev ) . * our choice of the spectral index",
    "is aimed at recovering the inferred index of @xmath61 at low energies by nst12 .",
    "the uncertainty in the inferred spectral index ( @xmath62 ) translates to an uncertainty in the momentum spectral index of @xmath63 .",
    "we also note that the diffusion coefficient of crs in the ism is thought to be energy dependent , and this energy dependence steepens the observed cr spectrum compared to the source spectrum . for protons ( @xmath64 ) , the diffusion coefficient at high energies scales as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 depends on the nature of turbulences which scatter the crs , @xmath7 for kolmogorov - type spectrum of turbulence ( e.g. , see  2 in ptuskin 2006 ) . at low energies ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient becomes independent of energy below an energy of @xmath67 gev ( for protons , with @xmath64 ) , as suggested by the observed ratios secondary to primary nuclei ( ptuskin 2006 ) .",
    "however , as biermann et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have suggested , convective transport is likely to become more dominant than diffusive ones since it is faster , at energies @xmath68 few gev / n . * in other words , the mode of cosmic ray transport likely changes at @xmath69 few gev / n , with convection dominating at low energies and diffusion at high energies .",
    "therefore , if we identify @xmath5 as the source spectrum , then ( a ) at low energies ( a few gev / n ) , diffusion loss does not steepen the spectrum , and we get a spectral index of @xmath62 in kinetic energy , and ( b ) the high energy spectrum will steepen by @xmath70 , rendering an index @xmath71 , consistent with the high energy measurements as mentioned above , especially the ams data . * also , the inferred spectral index at source is consistent with theoretical predictions ( see , e.g. , biermann 1993 ) .",
    "nst12 proposed that the break below @xmath72 gev arises either because of p - p interactions with ism or scattering from magnetic inhomogeneities which may be dominated by clouds of a certain size ( @xmath25 au ) .",
    "however , from the p - p interaction argument , the time scale is @xmath73 yr , much larger than the typical residence time scales of gcr inferred from other considerations .    in view of the * arguments * presented above , which makes two reasonable assumptions : ( a ) that the source spectrum of crs is a power - law in momentum and that ( b ) the diffusion coefficient becomes energy independent and/or becomes sub - dominant compared to convective transport , below @xmath74 gev , we find that the nst12 spectrum can be explained without recourse to any additional processes , _ although one can not rule out other processes contributing towards the spectral shape_.    = 0.4    -3 mm",
    "next , we wish to constrain the nst12 spectrum by determining a low energy cutoff below @xmath25 gev after comparing with the observed molecular ionization rate .    normalizing the spectrum derived by nst12 to the pamela flux above @xmath75 gev , and given the observed pamela flux at the energy bin centering @xmath76 gev to be @xmath77 @xmath78 sr@xmath11 s@xmath11 gev@xmath11 ( adriani et al .",
    "2011 ) , we adopt the following spectrum for the diffuse galactic cr protons : & & dn_p de_p + & = & 4.17 10 ^ -7 cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 gev^-1 ( e_p 213.23 gev ) ^_2 , + & & e_p e_b + & = & 4.17 10 ^ -7 cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 gev^-1 + & & ( e_b 213.23 gev ) ^_2 ( e_p e_b ) ^-_1 , e_p < e_b + & & 0 , e_p e_low    we follow padovani et al .",
    "( 2009 ) in our calculation of the ionization rate of molecular and atomic hydrogen .",
    "only the direct ionization by primary protons is significant and dominates over other processes such as ionization by cr electrons and electron capture by cr protons by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the ionization rate of @xmath79 by primary protons is , ^h_2= _",
    "p ^ion ( e_p ) de_p , where @xmath80 is the cr proton spectrum at a given kinetic energy @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the low energy limit of @xmath81 .",
    "the cross - section @xmath83 is given in padovani et al .",
    "we also multiply this ionization rate by a factor @xmath84 in order to take into account the ionization by secondary electrons ( spitzer & tomasko 1968 , dalgarno & griffing 1958 ) .",
    "the helium nuclei associated with the cr protons will enhance the ionization of the ism molecules . in order to assess the enhancement factor introduced by the addition of helium nuclei",
    ", we use the ratio of protons to helium nuclei as a function of kinetic energy per nucleon as determined by pamela down to a @xmath85 gev / n , and use the proton spectrum of nst12 down to the same value of kinetic energy .",
    "we found that the ratio of proton to helium flux in pamela data ( adriani et al .",
    "( 2011 ) can be fit to an accuracy of @xmath86 to the lowest kinetic energy ( per nucleon ) bin in their tables s3 and s4 , by the following expression : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the kinetic energy per nucleon .",
    "this ratio becomes constant above a value of @xmath89 gev / n , and decreases at lower energies .",
    "we find that the ionization rate increases by a factor @xmath90 if helium nuclei are included , using the ratio of @xmath91 along with the nst12 spectrum , for a low energy cutoff of @xmath85 gev / n .",
    "we note that the @xmath91 ratio as determined by pamela may however be affected by solar modulation , and therefore the enhancement of ionization may also be affected .",
    "if the low energy is shifted to @xmath29 gev / n , then the ionization rate increases by a factor @xmath92 , and for a cutoff at @xmath93 gev / n , the corresponding factor is @xmath94 .",
    "we note that these factors are somewhat lower than the standard factor of @xmath95 used in literature ( e.g. , rimmer et  al .",
    "2011 ) . keeping this uncertainty in mind",
    ", we multiply the ionization rate of protons by a factor @xmath96 below in order to take helium nuclei into account .",
    "= 0.4    -3 mm    we show in * figures 2 and 3 * the corresponding ionization rate @xmath18 as a function of the low energy cutoff , @xmath82 , and also show the observed * range * of @xmath97 s@xmath11 , * for the rates in diffuse clouds with low molecular content ( gerin ( 2010 ) ; neufeld ( 2010 ) ) .",
    "we choose this range since the propagation effects are least likely to affect in the case of low density diffuse clouds .",
    "* the curves show the ionization rates for different combinations of @xmath32 and @xmath98 , * but with @xmath99 in figure 2 and @xmath100 in figure 3 .",
    "we note that nst12 derived a value of @xmath99 in the case of maximal bremsstrahlung component , and provides an extreme limit . *    = 0.4    -3 mm    * the curves in figure 2 and 3 show that the ionization rates are somewhat lower in the case of @xmath99 than for @xmath100 . also , we find that the corresponding values of @xmath82 ranges between @xmath101 mev , for the average @xmath102 s@xmath11 for diffuse clouds with low molecular content .",
    "* we note that schuppan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) in their determination of the cr spectrum for mcs associated with snrs , did not add the bremsstrahlung component , and therefore their predicted high ionization rate is likely to be an overestimate .",
    "the low energy cutoff @xmath82 can arise from a number of effects , and we would like to discuss these possibilities here .      the low energy cutoff @xmath82 is related to the quantity of matter ( grammage ) the crs traverse on average in the galaxy , and the ionization losses suffered by the protons below @xmath103 .",
    "the ionization loss for protons traversing the ism is given by eqn 4.22 of mannheim & schlickeiser 1994 , ( ) = 4.96 10 ^ -19erg  s^-1  ( n_e/ cm^-3 ) ^2 ^3 + x_m^3 , [ eq : loss ] where @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the ambient ( electron ) temperature and density , and @xmath107 .",
    "the ionization loss increases rapidly with decreasing proton energy .    for low temperature ism gas , this ionization loss of protons",
    "can also be expressed in terms of the grammage ( @xmath108 ) as @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the lorentz factor .",
    "if we identify the cutoff energy @xmath82 as due to ionization loss , then the inferred grammage for @xmath111 mev is @xmath112 g @xmath78 .",
    "the grammage for a @xmath113 mev proton is @xmath67 gm @xmath78 .",
    "the average grammage inferred for gev cosmic rays in our galaxy is @xmath72 g @xmath78 ( e.g. , brunetti & codino 2000 ) .",
    "this grammage is believed to be smaller for lower energy protons , and go down to @xmath114 gm @xmath78 , for @xmath115 mev , and also decrease with higher energies ( e.g. , see fig 7 in garcia - munoz et  al ( 1987 ) ) .",
    "interestingly , this estimate of grammage inferred from the secondary / primary ratio is close to the grammage inferred from the interpretation of low energy cutoff of @xmath2 mev from ionization rate , as discussed above .",
    "this is our primary result , that using the nst12 spectrum allows us to identify the low energy cutoff with ionization rate , in the sense that the grammage inferred from b / c ratio at this energy coincides with the grammage expected from ionization loss .",
    "that this near equality is difficult to achieve with other cr spectrum is evident .",
    "if we were to assume a cr spectrum without a flattening down to a low energy cutoff , with a spectral index @xmath116 , then the galactic average ionization rate would constrain the low energy cutoff to @xmath117 mev . however , if this were to be identified as arising from ionization loss , then the corresponding grammage would be @xmath118 gm @xmath78 , much larger than even the peak grammage at gev scale .",
    "therefore our result shows that nst12 spectrum is consistent with the average galactic ionization rate with a corresponding grammage of cr protons at low energy arising from ionization loss .",
    "previous workers ( indriolo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ; becker et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ) have used a low energy cutoff of @xmath119 mev for diffuse clouds , and @xmath93 mev for dense clouds .",
    "it has been argued that the range of a 1 mev proton is @xmath120 g @xmath78 , corresponding to a column density of @xmath121 h @xmath78 .",
    "indriolo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) considered a low energy cutoff of @xmath122 mev for diffuse clouds with density @xmath123 @xmath124 , and becker et al .",
    "( 2011 ) assumed a low energy cutoff of @xmath93 mev for molecular clouds near snrs , with density @xmath125 @xmath124 . here also",
    ", the idea has been to find a consistency between the cr spectrum , the low energy cutoff and the ionization rate .",
    "however , the calculations mentioned here have either assumed a cr spectrum ( and found the ionization rate ) or found a cr spectrum for a given ionization rate . at times",
    "finding a convergence has been difficult . for example ,",
    "indriolo et  al ( 2009 ) found that their model cr spectrum that took propagation of crs in the milky way produced a lower ionization rate than observed , and they suggested the presence of an additional component of low energy crs .",
    "our result here shows that with the nst12 spectrum , a convergence of low energy cutoff , grammage and ionization rate is possible .    also , our results show that even for diffuse clouds a low energy cutoff below 10 mev is inconsistent with the galactic average ionization rate , and that the low energy cutoff lies in the range of @xmath2 mev .",
    "therefore , the cutoff in dense molecular clouds is likely to be larger than this value , and our results suggest that the ionization rate in molecular clouds with snrs , as in becker et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , is likely to be an overestimate because of the assumption of a low value of cutoff .",
    "interestingly , in the model of biermann et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the cr protons from snr shocks in ism are expected to have a grammage of @xmath25 gm @xmath78 , similar to the convergence value found in our analysis .",
    "crs from massive star supernovae are believed to consist of mainly heavy nuclei and their spallation products , while supernovae of moderate mass stars produce predominantly cr protons .",
    "the secondary crs produced in the spallation interactions of massive star supernovae with stellar wind material , are expected to have a much larger grammage .",
    "therefore our results support the acceleration of cr protons in snr shocks in ism .",
    "cesarsky & vlk ( 1978 ) proposed that cr streaming instability in the presence of magnetic field in mcs would excite alfvn waves which would scatter off low energy crs ( skilling & strong 1976 ) .",
    "they estimated that this would screen the mcs from galactic low energy crs , and that the low energy cutoff would be related to the cloud size ( @xmath126 ) , particle density @xmath127 and magnetic field @xmath128 , as @xmath129 this shows that for a typical mc magnetic field of a few @xmath130 g ( curran & chrysostomou 2007 ) , the low energy cutoff can be as large as @xmath131 mev .",
    "however , if we turn the argument around , then given the typical values of @xmath82 derived above for crs inside mcs imply that the ability of magnetic fields to screen low energy crs in mcs is smaller than previously thought , since it is clear that in order to sustain the typical average ionization rate in mcs , @xmath132 mev .",
    "in summary , we have studied the galactic cr proton spectrum recently inferred from gamma ray emission from molecular clouds near gould s belt .",
    "we have identified the inferred break of the energy spectrum at a few gev as a consequence of ( a ) the source cr spectrum being a power - law in momentum , of @xmath133 , and ( b ) the diffusion coefficient for protons being independent of energy below a few gev .",
    "we have shown that this renders the cr spectrum consistent with that observed at high energies .",
    "we have also derived a low energy cut - off for the cr spectrum , after comparing with the observed galactic ionization rate of molecular hydrogen ( since the ionization is dominated by protons ) , and found its values to lie in the range of @xmath2 mev .",
    "we have then shown that the nst12 spectrum is consistent with three independent phenomena : ( a ) ionization loss that corresponds to a particular value of grammage , ( b ) grammage as inferred from other means , and ( c ) the average galactic ionization rate .",
    "we thank the anonymous referees for their comments that helped to improve the paper ."
