    "while flavor - changing parity - violating ( pv ) interactions are well understood theoretically and a great deal of precise data exists , knowledge of flavor - conserving parity - violation is rather primitive .",
    "flavor - conserving parity - violation continues to be an area of intense investigation in the nuclear physics community .",
    "its study is presently serving both to uncover the structure of the nucleon in electron - scattering experiments such as sample@xcite , and to determine pv flavor - conserving couplings between pions and nucleons@xcite .",
    "the problems that are encountered in this sector are both experimental and theoretical . on the experimental side ,",
    "the pv signals , unlike those in flavor - changing processes , appear as small deviations in either a strong or an electromagnetic process , such as pv in @xmath0 , or in the circular polarization of the @xmath1-ray emitted in @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the current situation is somewhat confused by the fact that measurements of parity - violation in atoms and nuclei do not give rise to a consistent set of couplings between hadrons  @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind that many of the `` experimental '' determinations of these couplings require theoretical inputs with varying degrees of reliability .",
    "recently , it has been reemphasized that measurements of pv observables in the single - nucleon sector would significantly ameliorate the situation by eliminating many - body uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "despite the inherent difficulty of such experiments , there are ongoing efforts to measure pv processes in systems with only one or two nucleons , such as the angular - asymmetry in @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "such measurements should provide a reliable determination of the leading - order ( lo ) , momentum - independent weak @xmath4 coupling constant , @xmath5 .    on the theoretical side , despite heroic efforts to model  @xcite hadronic matrix elements of the four - quark operators that appear in the low - energy effective theory of the standard model , there are no reliable calculations of the pv couplings between hadrons",
    ". a first principles calculation of @xmath5 in lattice qcd would therefore be extremely welcome .",
    "this would require a lattice qcd simulation of a correlator with three hadronic sources interacting via a four - quark operator .",
    "unfortunately , chiral symmetry does not allow one to relate the @xmath4 correlator to a correlator without the pion .",
    "on the bright side , the structure of the four - quark weak hamiltonian requires a flavor change in the nucleon and therefore there are no disconnected diagrams to be computed on the lattice .",
    "a standard difficulty in reliably computing @xmath5 on the lattice is that present computational limitations necessitate the use of lattice quark masses that are significantly larger than those of nature . in order to make a connection between lattice calculations in the foreseeable future and nature , an extrapolation in the quark masses is required .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath6pt ) provides a systematic description of low - energy qcd near the chiral limit , and this technique has been extended to describe both quenched qcd ( qqcd )  @xcite and partially - quenched qcd ( pqqcd )  @xcite .",
    "the hope is that future lattice simulations can be performed with quark masses that are small enough to guarantee a convergent chiral expansion , thus allowing a meaningful extrapolation to the quark masses of nature .",
    "recently , it has been shown how to include the low - lying octet and decuplet of baryons  @xcite into partially - quenched chiral perturbation theory ( pq@xmath6pt )  @xcite . in this work",
    "we will present @xmath5 and the anapole moment of the proton at one - loop level in @xmath7 pq@xmath6pt with two non - degenerate light quarks . given that lattice simulations have on - shell particles in both the initial and final states , extraction of @xmath5 requires the injection of energy at the weak vertex .",
    "this energy non - conservation modifies the effective field theory description of the three - point function by requiring the inclusion of operators that are total derivatives .",
    "we present a calculation of @xmath5 at the one - loop level both for the case where energy is conserved and the pion is off its mass - shell with @xmath8 , and for lattice kinematics where energy is injected at the weak vertex .",
    "the four - quark operators that contribute to flavor - conserving , low - energy pv processes can be classified by how they act in isospin space , @xmath9 . their qcd evolution from the weak - scale down to the strong interaction scale has been computed previously  @xcite . in this work",
    "we focus on the @xmath10 interaction , as it is only in this channel that the lo operator in the chiral expansion is momentum independent . in qcd ,",

    "this symmetry is reflected in the relative magnitudes of the @xmath16 versus the @xmath17 .",
    "if strange quarks were to play no role in the structure of the nucleon , two - flavor lattice qcd simulations would provide an accurate calculation of the matrix elements of @xmath18 , but to the extent to which strange matrix elements are non - zero , the two - flavor simulations provide only part of the pv matrix elements .",
