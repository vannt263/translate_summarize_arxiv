    "since the discovery of carbon nanotubes by iijima  @xcite in 1991 , much effort has been devoted experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite to study this new material .",
    "the one dimensional character of single wall nanotubes ( swnt s ) enables them to exhibit very interesting physical properties due to the quantum confinement of electrons in a one dimensional lattice .",
    "remarkable optical , thermoelectric , mechanical and electronic properties can be expected .",
    "doping or intercalation  @xcite , structural defects  @xcite and pressure effects  @xcite are known to enrich these properties .",
    "resonant raman spectroscopy and optical absorption spectroscopy  @xcite have been widely used to describe the electronic structure of isolated and ropes of nanotubes .",
    "scanning tunneling microscopy  @xcite has also been used to detect the van hove spikes of swnt s .",
    "most of the theoretical studies are based on the application of the born - von karman boundary conditions to the two dimensional graphene sheet  @xcite in a zone - folding technique and the all - valence tight - binding method  @xcite .",
    "this graphene zone - folding approach is known to be inaccurate to describe the unoccupied density of states ( dos )  @xcite a few ev s beyond the fermi level .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations  @xcite have also been carried out but very few calculations  @xcite probing core - loss spectra are available . electron energy loss spectrum ( eels ) and x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) measurements are available but their theoretical interpretation is often limited to the site and angular momentum projected local density of states ( ldos ) .",
    "this interpretation does not account for transition matrix elements which are known to be important and sensitive to the momentum transfer direction for anisotropic materials like graphite and carbon nanotubes .",
    "while the dos of a tube is characterised by the van hove singularities inherent to the one dimensional nature of the tube , it has been argued that the eel spectrum is free of any such spikes due to the effect of the c1s core - hole in the final state  @xcite .",
    "this implies a strong energy dependence of the transition matrix elements .",
    "we point out , contrary to this assertion , that the energy dependence of the transition matrix elements is weak meaning that the spikes may always feature in the eels spectra if the energy resolution is good enough and thermal effects are rendered minimal .",
    "the few dft calculations of energy loss near edge spectra ( elnes ) so far available  @xcite do not include the all important core - hole effect on the elnes .",
    "we have included and analysed these effects on the carbon k - edges of nanotubes .",
    "we perform ab initio calculations on a series of single - wall armchair and zigzag nanotubes .",
    "we present results on the electronic properties of the carbon nanotubes .",
    "for comparison with other calculations , we considered the ( 6,6 ) , ( 5,0 ) and ( 10,0 ) tubes .",
    "the obtained band structure is in good agreement with earlier results for both the ( 6,6 ) tube  @xcite and the ( 5,0 ) tube  @xcite .",
    "the calculated c k - edges agree with those of suenaga et al.@xcite for the ( 5,0 ) and ( 10,0 ) tubes .",
    "this agreement with other calculations validate the method used in this work .",
    "much emphasis is laid on the curvature , orientation and core - hole effects on the c k - edges , as these aspects have not been addressed so far .    in order to demonstrate the fact that energy loss near edge structure ( elnes ) probes the local bonding states in materials , we considered so - called nanoarcs , which consist of curved graphite sheets which are repeated in space either as wavy objects or as bonded arcs . for feasible calculations",

    "the effective potential @xmath12 created by the electronic and nuclear charges is given in atomic units as @xmath13 @xmath14 is the charge of the @xmath15th nucleus located at @xmath16 .",
    "the electron charge density is constructed from the kohn - sham eigenfunctions @xmath11 as @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the occupation number of the eigenstate @xmath19 .",
    "many functionals exist for the exchange and correlation energy , the simplest and widely used being the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) which exists in several forms   @xcite .",
    "improvements on the locality are found by using the generalised gradient approximation ( gga ) ( e.g. perdew et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    the index @xmath20 in the basis set @xmath21 is easily understood in the language of the one - particle bloch states @xmath22 which are expanded into atomic - like waves inside of spheres centred on atoms ( muffin - tin spheres ) matched to plane waves in the interstitial region .",
    "the band state inside of sphere @xmath23 is written in the slater s augmented plane - wave method as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and the radial function @xmath26 is the solution of the radial kohn - sham equation in the spherically averaged crystal potential .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath27 are determined from the boundary conditions at the sphere s surface .",
    "the normalisation condition on @xmath28 may be written as @xmath29 which is a sum over all the local partial charges associated with the band state @xmath30 .      in the above formulation",

    "we now introduce the expression central to the theory of electron scattering by the atoms of a crystal .",

    "the orientation resolved elnes calculations , the electron beam , the tube axis and the normal to the walls of the tube will all lie in the same plane .",
    "the microscope setting will be characterised by the beam convergence semi - angle @xmath63 and the aperture collection semi - angle @xmath64 .",
    "the dynamic form factor is calculated by integrating over all possible orientations of the momentum transfer within the solid angles subtended by the convergence and collection semi - angles .",

    "it is important to remark that if we define the @xmath79 orbital axis as one making equal angles with all three @xmath80 bonds of a 3-coordinated atom then this angle will be equal to the pyramidalisation angle for the case of a nanotube .",
    "the deviation of this angle from 90@xmath1 induces a new hybrid between the s and the p@xmath81 ( z in the language of the planar trigonal coordination ) orbitals ( s@xmath82p@xmath81 ) .",

    "we study the electronic properties of a series of carbon nanotubes and some curved carbon systems using the ab initio all - electron full - potential - linearised - augmented - plane - wave ( fplapw ) package wien2k @xcite .",
    "the unit cell is partitioned into two regions ; regions of nonoverlapping spheres centred on the atoms and an interstitial region .",
    "the basis functions inside the muffin - tin spheres are linear combinations of spherical harmonics @xmath93 and radial functions @xmath94 .",
    "these are augmented with a plane wave basis in the interstitial region ( with the coefficients being functions of the reciprocal lattice vectors and the wave vectors of the first brillouin zone ) .",
    "the maximum @xmath95-value of 10 is adopted inside the atomic spheres .",
    "the charge density is fourier expanded up to @xmath96 .",
    "the brillouin - zone integration is done using the blchl  @xcite improved tetrahedron method .",
    "the exchange and correlation energy is treated using the local spin density approximation  @xcite which is a fit to the greens - function monte carlo calculations of ceperley and alder  @xcite .",
    "core states are treated fully relativistically .",
    "the choice of the muffin - tin radius and the plane wave energy cut - off are governed by the parameter @xmath97 ( where @xmath98 is the smallest muffin - tin radius in the crystal ) .",
    "for these carbon systems the 1s state is the core state while 2s and 2p are the valence states .",
    "muffin - tin radii of 1.3 a.u . are used .",
    "the total number of k - points in the full brillouin zone was fixed at 1000 ( between 60 and 80 in the irreducible wedge , depending on the dimensions of the unit cell ) for the self consistency calculations without the core - hole effect and 300 ( between 100 and 150 in the irreducible wedge - due to lower symmetry ) for core - hole calculations in larger unit cells . due to the supercell nature of each unit cell of the nanotube , these values should be representative of infinite samplings of the brillouin zones .",
    "the tubes ( and also the nonoarcs ) are arrayed in orthorhombic unit cells .",
    "the ideal graphene folded cylinders are adopted for all the tubes studied .",
    "for the ( 6,6 ) tube the difference in dos and elnes for rkm values of 5 , 6 and 7 were insignificant .",
    "so we adopted an rkm value of 5.5 for all other tubes .",
    "when a core electron is excited into the unoccupied level a core - hole is left behind which interacts with the valence and conduction electrons and modifies the crystal electronic structure if the core - hole is not well screened by the valence and conduction electrons . in metals",
    "the screening is effective meanwhile in semiconductors there is less screening and the core - hole interaction becomes very important .",
    "this core - hole interaction is a dynamical process and should be treated dynamically using the greens - function approach  @xcite .",
    "two ad hoc techniques are widely used to account for this core - state effect .",
    "these include the z+1 method or the equivalent core approximation  @xcite whereby the excited core seen by the valence and conduction electrons is equivalent to that of an atom with atomic number z+1 .",
    "for the case of carbon systems the core atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom .",
    "the second method , which we term the core - excited method , consists of introducing a core - hole in the core state by removing an electron from it and inserting it as a uniform background charge . in the so - called `` sudden '' approximation",
    "no core - hole effect is considered and elnes or any excitation process is calculated from the ground state electronic structure .",
    "eq.([eq : dff ] ) has been implemented into the wien2k package  @xcite .",
    "elnes was calculated on the lowest symmetry - adapted k - mesh of each system where all symmetry operations are eliminated except the identity . by doing so cross terms of the dynamic form factor are well reproduced .",
    "the core - hole effect is introduced in all the tubes studied via the core - excited method . for the armchair tubes ( n ,",
    "n ) the unit cell was doubled along the tube axis in order to increase the distance between core atoms .",
    "this means a minimum distance between core atoms of 4.91  and 8n atoms per unit cell .",
    "since the length of the smallest unit cell along tube axis was 4.26   for the zigzag tube ( n,0 ) , these smallest unit cells with 4n atoms were used for all such tubes with one of the 4n atoms made the core atom .",
    "the minimum wall - to - wall distance was set at 4   to reduce intertube interactions .",
    "the various tubes studied together with their diameters and pyramidalisation angles are shown on table  [ tabl : tubes ] . in order to study the curvature effect on the electronic properties of nanotubes",
    ", we also considered the case of the ( 4,0 ) tube which has not been shown to exist in nature .",

    "it follows that all armchair tubes are metallic .",
    "figure  [ fig : tdos ] shows the ground state total dos of all the studied tubes .",
    "remark the feature at the fermi level for the strongest curved tube ( 4,0 ) .",
    "this feature is also present for all other small zigzag tubes but to lesser intensity as the curvature decreases .",
    "it vanishes for the ( 10,0 ) tube .",
    "such a remarkable curvature dependent feature is absent for all armchair tubes whose dos remains flat within @xmath100 ev around the fermi level except for a depression of the dos at the fermi level for the small ( 4,4 ) tube .",
    "such a depression was also reported by delaney et al .",
    "@xcite on a dft calculation on the ( 10,10 ) tube and this was due to inter - tube interactions .",
    "the metallicity condition according to the zone - folding tight - binding theory is based on the @xmath79 and @xmath101 bands .",
    "the notion of @xmath79 and @xmath80 becomes ill - defined for these curved systems but we may speak of curvature induced @xmath79-@xmath80 ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 of the planar graphene ) hybridisation to form new hybrids .",
    "a careful study of the local density of states ( for a particular atom ) in all three directions ( axial , radial and perimetral to the tube ) reveals some interesting aspects : in that while the finite ldos at the fermi level of all the small tubes are dominantly radial to the tube ( see figure  [ fig : metallicity ] ) , non negligible axial and perimetral ldos are present around the fermi level for the small zigzag tubes . this is a signature of @xmath0 hybridisation .",
    "this hybridisation is weak for tubes whose diameters are greater than 5.5   irrespective of chirality .",
    "this @xmath0 hybridisation may be quantified in the @xmath79-orbital axis vector ( poav1 ) approximation  @xcite described above . in this approximation , as much as 22% p@xmath81 electrons participate in the @xmath80 bonding for the ( 4,0 ) tube while less than 4% participates for the ( 7,0 ) and ( 4,4 ) tubes of similar diameters  @xmath1025.5 .",
    "it is important to remark that while the curvature - induced hybridisation drastically modifies the electronics of small diameter zigzag tubes its effect on arm chair tubes is weaker .",
    "blase et al .",
    "@xcite studied the hybridisation effects on the metallicity of small radius zig - zag nts and concluded that the curvature induced @xmath0 hybridisation effects change the energy and character of lowest lying conduction band states with important consequences on the metallicity and transport properties of the tubes .",
    "reich and thomsen  @xcite also pointed out that , compared to the zigzag tubes , the electronic band structure is less affected in the armchair and chiral tubes by the curvature induced @xmath0 hybridisation .",
    "for the ( 4,0 ) , ( 5,0 ) , ( 7,0 ) , ( 10,0 ) , ( 5,5 ) and ( 6,6 ) tubes we performed core - hole - included dft calculations , using the excited - core approach , by removing an electron from the 1s state and inserting it as a uniform background charge .",
    "for the ( 5,0 ) tube we also introduced the core - hole effect through the alternative z+1 method  @xcite which essentially gave the same result .",
    "these core - hole techniques have also been applied on graphite and are found to yield the same results which are in good agreement with the elnes measurements  @xcite up to about 15 ev beyond the threshold .    for the zigzag tubes the minimum distance between core atoms",
    "was set at 4.26    while for the armchair tubes it was fixed at 4.91  . due to this difference in the inter - core - atom distances , we expect stronger intratube interactions between the core atoms of the zigzag tubes than in the armchair tubes though this interaction will not strongly influence the c k - edges .",
    "intertube core - atoms interactions can be ignored as the least distance between such atoms is more than 7 . on figure",
    "[ fig : core - hole - nt ] we compare the effects of the inclusion of core - hole on the c k - edge of six tubes . to account for instrumental and life - time broadening we convoluted the calculated spectra with gaussians with full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 0.5 ev .",
    "the microscope convergence and collection semi - angles ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) were set at the magic values ( 1.87 , 3.01 mrad ) .",
    "orientation averaged spectra are shown though at this microscope setting no orientation effect should be seen .",
    "the immediate effect of the core - hole interaction is the shifting of the @xmath101 edge to lower energies and the redistribution of @xmath103 intensity to the lower energy part .",
    "a signature of @xmath0 hybridisation is the feature at 5 ev which decreases in intensity as the tube diameter increases from the ( 4,0 ) tube through the ( 7,0 ) tube and is evidenced in the armchair tubes as the shoulders of the lower energy part of the @xmath80 peaks .",
    "comparison with measurements on swnt  @xcite reveals that the core - hole must be considered if elnes measurements are to be correctly explained theoretically .",
    "knupfer et al .",
    "@xcite detected a new feature in a single - wall carbon nanotube 1s eels spectrum about 2 ev above the @xmath101 peak ( i.e. about 5 ev above the fermi level ) , which was absent in some samples  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this feature remained unexplained . on figure",
    "[ fig : core - hole - nt ] we remark the @xmath0 hybridisation features 2 - 3 ev above the main @xmath101 peak of small tubes .",

    "elnes spectra were also calculated in the so - called `` sudden '' approximation for all the nine tubes and compared with that of flat graphene in figure  [ fig : elnes - cuvature ] .",
    "although it is very clear by now that elnes calculations on nanotubes that do not include the core - hole effects can not be used to explain experimental eels measurements , such calculations should lead to insights in the ground state momentum projected local density of states and the effects of curvature or local deviations from planar configurations on the transition matrix elements . as figure",
    "[ fig : elnes - cuvature ] shows , the direct effect of curvature is the splitting of the @xmath101 peak into the a@xmath104 and a@xmath105 ( b@xmath104 and b@xmath105 ) features for the zigzag ( armchair ) tubes and the splitting of the @xmath103 peak into the a@xmath106 and a@xmath107 ( b@xmath106 and b@xmath107 ) features for the zigzag ( armchair ) tubes .",
    "suenaga et al .",
    "@xcite performed the elnes calculation of ( 5,0 ) and ( 10,0 ) tubes ( in the sudden approximation ) and reported the splitting of the @xmath101 peak as curvature increases .",
    "they also pointed out that as the curvature increases the @xmath103 peak decreases .",
    "we remark also that as the curvature increases the predominantly @xmath101 peak a@xmath104 diminishes while the intensity of the hybrid feature a@xmath105 grows .",

    "this point emphasises the fact that the curvature induced @xmath0 hybridisation effect is stronger in zigzag tubes than in armchair tubes . from figure",
    "[ fig : core - hole - nt ] we also notice that the core - hole leads to a clear distinction between the @xmath101 and the @xmath103 edge onsets .      in order to investigate the relationship between angular momentum projected local dos and the calculated elnes and the effect of core - hole on the transition matrix elements we plot the radial ( p@xmath108 ) , perimetral ( p@xmath109 ) and axial ( p@xmath110 ) p density of states of an atom together with the unbroadened elnes for the ( 5,5 ) tube on figure  [ fig : matrix - elt ] .",

    "remark that the agreement between ldos and elnes is excellent for the momentum resolved elnes .",
    "this strong agreement between elnes features and ldos shows the weak energy dependence of the transition matrix elements though these will be shown to depend strongly on the electron beam orientation and the microscope settings .",
    "it also shows that the dipole selection rule governs the elnes spectrum for nanotubes because all the elnes features are those of the pldos .",
    "knupfer et al .",
    "@xcite reported the elnes spectrum of a swnt which was free of singularities and concluded that the core - hole effect was responsible for this . though their measurements were done using a high energy resolution microscope ( 0.115 ev ) , which should be able to detect the spikes , these were conspicuous by their absence .",
    "thermal broadening could have been responsible for the washing out of these singularities .      on figure  [ fig :",

    ", we can conclude that this anisotropy is entirely governed by the transition matrix elements and that the latter depend strongly on the electron beam characteristics and the microscope settings in a manner well elaborated in refs .",

    "we performed a ( @xmath119,@xmath120 ) decomposition  @xcite ( which consists of the various terms of eq.([eq : dff ] ) when @xmath119 and @xmath120 are fixed ) of the elnes in a fixed reference frame . in this decomposition , the 1s@xmath121 elnes has three components : ( 1,0 ) , ( 1,-1 ) and ( 1,+1 ) components . in the case of a planar system where the z - axis is perpendicular to the plane ( for example , graphite ) the ( 1,0 ) component will correspond to the 1s@xmath122 transition while ( 1,-1)+(1,+1 ) will correspond to the 1s@xmath123 transition . in the case of the ( 6,6 ) and ( 10,0 ) nanotubes , where the z - axis was along the tube axis ,",
    "the ( 1,0 ) component becomes a transition into the axial @xmath103 orbitals .",
    "unfortunately the ( 1,-1 ) and ( 1,+1 ) components become inseparable mixtures of @xmath101 and the perimetral @xmath103 components for these cases ( see figure  [ fig : orientation-10,0 ] ) .",
    "it is important to point out that the elnes spectra on figure  [ fig : orientation-10,0 ] are entirely given by the three p elnes - components for all the three collection angles .",
    "this illustrates the fact that even for relatively large collection angles , the dipole sellection rule is still valid . in the case of the ( 5,0 ) tube we fixed the z - axis normal to the walls of the tube such that the ( 1,0 ) component can be obtained separately . on figure",
    "[ fig : orientation-5 - 0 ] we show the total elnes , the @xmath101 and the @xmath103 components of the core - hole calculated elnes of the ( 5,0 ) tube .",
    "remark that , as a signature of @xmath0 hybridisation , the tail of the @xmath103 component overlaps with the @xmath101 spectrum .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation ( see figure  [ fig : metallicity ] ) that around the fermi level there is a non negligible dos resulting from perimetral and axial @xmath80 orbitals for the ( 5,0 ) tube . according to the poav1 approximation  @xcite ,",
    "14% of the p@xmath81 orbitals should participate in the hybrid orbital formation for the ( 5,0 ) tube .",
    "this agrees with the 15% obtained when two gaussian centred functions , one ( p@xmath104 ) describing the overlapping lower energy tail of the @xmath103 edge and the other ( p@xmath105 ) for the main @xmath103 peak , are used to fit the @xmath103 edge as shown on figure  [ fig : orientation-5 - 0 ] .",
    "the 15% was given by the ratio area(p@xmath104)/area(p@xmath104+p@xmath105 ) .",
    "orientation resolved elnes measurements should be able to reveal this rehybridisation in such small tubes .",
    "this technique of ( l@xmath124,m@xmath124 ) decomposition has recently been applied to hexagonal bn  @xcite and graphite  @xcite , both of which have planar symmetry .",
    "we believe that this @xmath101/@xmath103 decomposition in planar systems is a viable alternative to the existing techniques  @xcite for sp@xmath125/sp@xmath92 quantification of carbon materials based on the isolation of the @xmath101/@xmath103 excitation cross - sections .",
    "it is usually postulated that elnes probes the local properties of materials . in particular ,",
    "spatial and momentum resolved elnes are often used as fingerprints of bonding states and local disorder or to explore the presence of grain - boundaries in materials . due to the strong curvature applied to graphene to form a nanotube ,",
    "carbon can undergo a wide range of bonding states from sp@xmath125 for flat graphene to sp@xmath126 for tubes with similar diameters as the c@xmath88 molecule .",
    "this may imply a curvature induced re - activity of nanotubes different from that of graphite  @xcite .    in this section",
    "we consider arcs of tubes which are repeated in space periodically as bonded or wavy arcs in order to investigate the local nature of the energy loss near edge structures .",
    "we calculated the dos and elnes of these arcs and compared them with those of the full tubes .",
    "stphan et al .",
    "@xcite simulated the curvature effects on the unoccupied density of states of nt s by considering a corrugated graphene sheet in which the corrugation was defined by the chair configuration of the carbon hexagons with a corrugation angle of 8@xmath1 ( an atom is lifted out of the plane such that the lifted bond vectors make an angle of 8@xmath1 with the plane ) to model a 10    tube .",
    "such a model which considers only the corrugation angle and ignores the chiral angle can not be expected to be representative ( electronically ) of tubes as small as 10    in diameter .",
    "our bonded / wavy arcs are aimed at addressing this problem .",
    "we define arcs of a given nanotube , e.g. an arc of an armchair tube ( n , n ) as a section of the tube that is cut out and is repeated in space ( because of the use of the periodic boundary conditions ) either by bonds ( of the order of c - c bond length - see figure  [ fig : bonded ] ) or as the wavy objects shown on figure  [ fig : wavy ] .",
    "this latter model diminishes the unphysical hybridisations that are introduced by the boat configurations ( for armchair arcs ) and the 8 atoms ring configurations ( for zigzag arcs ) in the bonded arcs .",
    "the size of each arc is chosen large enough so that at least one of its carbon atoms is situated at a minimum distance of two c@xmath127c bond - lengths from the point of contact of two arcs .",
    "this is to ensure a reduced interaction between the defectuous points and the carbon atom whose local properties should be comparable to those of an atom in a defect - free tube of similar curvature and chirality .    on figures  [ fig : dos - eels-6,6 ] and [ fig : dos - eels-10,0 ]",
    "we show the total density of states and the elnes spectra of the c k - edges of the ( 6,6 ) and ( 10,0 ) tubes , respectively . for the elnes spectra on these figures",
    "no core - hole calculations are used .",
    "the dos and the carbon 1s excitation edges are also shown for the nanoarcs .",
    "the wavy and the bonded arcs reproduce qualitatively well ( up to 12 ev beyond the edge onset ) the elnes of the ( 6,6 ) and the ( 10,0 ) tubes . these good agreements of the calculated elnes of curved arcs with those of tubes of similar radius of curvature and chirality confirm the fact that elnes ( up to 10 - 15 ev above threshold ) probes local structures .",
    "the total density of states , on the other hand , is a property that depends on the underlying periodicity .",
    "it should be strongly affected by periodically repeated defects like the boats and 8 atoms rings present in the bonded arcs .",
    "while the ldos describes the local electronic structures , the total dos is responsible for the observed macroscopic properties like metallicity .",
    "we have performed first principles calculations on a series of armchair and zigzag nanotubes of diameters less than 1 nm using the all - electron full - potential(-linearised)-augmented - plane - wave method .",
    "we have investigated in detail the effects of curvature , core - hole interaction and orientation on the elnes of carbon nanotubes .",
    "the inclusion of the core - hole effect is very important to reproduce the measured elnes spectra of carbon nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "a curvature - induced @xmath0 hybridisation is pointed out and shown to have a stronger effect on zigzag tubes than on armchair tubes . not only does elnes calculated in the sudden approximation  @xcite fail to explain the experimental measurements , an analysis of the @xmath0 hybridisation based on it may be misleading especially for small diameter zigzag tubes as they do not show a clear separation between the @xmath101 and @xmath103 features .",
    "we have shown that the elnes of carbon nanotubes obeys the dipole selection rule and that the local dos of the excited atom and the elnes spectrum may show spikes due to the van hove singularity , which are characteristic of the quasi one - dimensional nature of the nanotubes .",
    "the curvature effect is translated into the electron energy loss spectra by the splitting of the @xmath101 and the @xmath103 edges . a reduction in the anisotropy , as compared to graphite , is also recorded for these highly curved carbon systems in line with the findings of stphan et al .",
    "@xcite although this anisotropy depends on the microscope settings .",
    "it is found that the magic convergence and collection semi - angles ( 1.87 , 3.01 mrad ) found for graphite gives an electron beam orientation independent elnes for nanotubes .",
    "therefore , nanotubes can be used as an alternative to graphite as an anisotropic material to determine the magic collection and convergence semi - angles for carbon materials .",
    "the advantage of nanotubes over graphite is the ability to explore a large range of focused electron beam orientations .",
    "the ( l@xmath124,m@xmath124 ) elnes decomposition has been shown to be very valuable to unambiguously quantify the @xmath0 hybridisation in small nanotubes . this decomposition may be a promising technique to study the type of bonding in carbon materials .",
    "we have performed calculations on model arcs of tubes and confirmed that elnes probes the local bonding structures of materials .",
