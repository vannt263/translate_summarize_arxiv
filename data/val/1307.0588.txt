    "oil from spills , red tides , flotsam and other suspended and surface tracers approach the nearshore , carried by winds and currents .",
    "it is not uncommon , however , that these debris and tracers slow down and park themselves , somewhere beyond the break zone ( see figure  [ red ] ) ; eventually , a portion of these reach the beach zone by the action of turbulence and tidal effects , in combination with inertial effects on the debris .    the tendency of tracers to park themselves in certain areas of the great barrier reef has been noted .",
    "@xcite , who reported the phenomenon , and denoted it as  sticky waters . \"",
    "though we will not be discussing estuarine environments and the mechanism at play in the great barrier reef situation may be different from the nearshore case , we will borrow this terminology and refer to the phenomenon we investigate in this paper as  nearshore sticky waters . \"    of obvious environmental , economic , and social importance ,",
    "understanding why nearshore sticky waters occur is also fundamental to improved environmental assessments of coastal settings .",
    "moreover , as part of a larger research agenda aimed at improving models for pollutant transport in ocean general circulation models , nearshore sticky waters offers a field - verifiable problem with which to test contaminant advection reaction and dispersion models .",
    "the focus is on tracer transport phenomena , with length scales several times larger than the depth and temporal scales of hours , weeks .",
    "that is , we are mostly concerned with large - scale pollution  disasters , \" such as large - scale red tides , significant oil spills , etc .",
    "although we consider long time and space scales , we can not ignore depth dependent features of the flow and the transport of tracers .",
    "the tracer may be buoyant but not necessarily entirely residing on the surface of the ocean ; we therefore consider a layered ( instead of simply depth averaged ) model for the tracer and account for the vertical structure of the advective velocity .",
    "we defer consideration of tracers with non - trivial inertial effects to a separate study . obviously , tracers advect and diffuse in the alongshore direction as well as in the cross - shore direction .",
    "in fact , advection / diffusion in the longshore direction is usually more intense in many non - estuarine environments .",
    "however , if we consider a situation where the longshore variations of the tracer concentrations are small , the divergence of the flux in the longshore direction is negligible , and it is appropriate to consider a one - dimensional problem in the cross - shore direction .",
    "nearshore sticky waters will refer to the slowing down or the parking of the tracer approaching the shore . in a sticky water situation",
    "the center of mass of the incoming tracer that is approaching the shore at advective speeds will experience a partial or total slowing down . whatever tracer amounts reach the shore will do so by the action of dispersive effects , usually higher inside the breakzone than in deeper waters . in the cross - shore direction ,",
    "large scale currents are typically weak , close to the shore . in a wave - dominated nearshore",
    "setting , the typical advection velocity would be the residual flow due to the waves , the stokes drift velocity .",
    "the length scales are those of the long waves , _",
    "i.e. _ , waves which have wavelengths that are large when compared to the depth .",
    "the diffusive length scale is typified by large - scale eddies ; if the break zone is a significant source of mixing , the length scale would be the distance between the start of the breaking of the waves and the shore .",
    "when advective and diffusive effects are those in balance , the diffusive time scale is large , in the order of hours .",
    "there is consensus that in wave - dominated beaches the dissipation of waves is different inside and outside of the breakzone , the latter being considerably smaller than the former .",
    "@xcite , chapter 10 , describes the theoretical development of a model for wave action dissipation , based upon dimensional analysis and homogeneous turbulence concepts ( see also @xcite , for further developments ) .",
    "the model used in @xcite is that of @xcite , which is one of several based upon hydraulic jump parametrizations .",
    "analysis of field data of the dispersion of tracers in the nearshore suggest that the diffusivity is much higher in the break zone than outside .",
    "dispersion estimates based upon the dimensional analysis model of @xcite are off by orders of magnitude , when compared to field data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a possible explanation for the discrepancy might lie in the fact that the dimensional parametrization is based upon homogeneous turbulence conditions and is more typical of the smaller scale vertical diffusion , rather than the larger eddy - scale transverse diffusion ( feddersen , private communication ) .",
    "the basic depth - averaged hydrodynamics , appropriate to these scales , are captured by the similarly scaled vortex force model in @xcite ( see @xcite for background and @xcite for a comparison of this `` vortex force '' model and the `` radiation stress '' alternative . see also @xcite ) . in the following form",
    ", the model has been used to study nearshore problems , such as longshore currents ( in @xcite ) , and rip currents ( in @xcite ) .",

    "the vortex force is the second term on the right hand side , which couples the residual flow due to the waves to the rotation in the current @xmath4 .",
    "the depth - averaged stokes drift velocity is denoted by @xmath5 ; the operator @xmath6 is used to obtain @xmath7^\\bot = ( -v^{st},u^{st})$ ] .",
    "the continuity equation reads @xmath8 , \\label{continuity}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the local water column depth and @xmath10 is the composite sea elevation ; @xmath11 is the quasi - static sea elevation .",
    "the waves are found via conservation equations for the wave action @xmath12 , and wavenumber @xmath13 .",
    "for the wave action , the equation is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the loss term and @xmath16 is the absolute group velocity , @xmath17 the relative frequency is @xmath18 , where the frequency satisfies the dispersion relation @xmath19 .",

    "the simplest situation we consider is that of a flow with mean shoreward - directed velocity , transporting the pollutant toward land , flowing over a sloped and featureless bathymetry .",
    "we consider a nearshore domain that has only transverse extent @xmath27 and depth @xmath28 ; the water column increases in depth , away from the shore .",
    "consideration of the actual mechanism that is generating the current field makes the basic story presented here richer , but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "instead we focus on the basic kinematics of the tracers .",
    "the advecting mean current , with a shore - directed component , might consist entirely or partially of a wave - induced flow , the stokes drift velocity ( see @xcite ) . for specificity we will assume , in fact , that the advective mean current is exclusively composed of the stokes drift and that these are generated by shore - directed waves .",
    "( as the reader will eventually surmise we could have assumed instead the presence of currents not associated with waves , or even considered the case where both wave - induced flows and currents are present ; nearshore sticky waters conditions do not require the presence of wave - generated currents ) .",
    "according to ( [ mom ] ) , however , this stokes drift will not generate a vortex force .",
    "if the velocity at the shore end , at @xmath29 , is zero , the cross - shore component of the depth - averaged current @xmath30 must be equal and opposite to the cross - shore component of the depth - averaged stokes drift velocity ( in @xcite we recognized it as the _ anti - stokes _ current , but more generally it is the undertow current .",
    "see @xcite for more details concerning the anti - stokes current .",
    "this is a very readable introduction to the nearshore flow environment ) .",
    "the stokes drift velocity depends on the wave action and the wavenumber by ( [ waveac ] ) and ( [ wavenumber ] ) .",
    "in @xcite , figure 1 , are shown the somewhat typical slight increases in the wave action , as the waves approach the breakzone , followed by their partial or full dissipation due to wave breaking , with an ensuing transfer of momentum to the currents .",
    "the resulting cross - shore component of the stokes drift velocity increases as the waves shoal , and then diminishes drastically or becomes insignificant . if a separate current can be identified in the flow , and waves are present , an ensuing transfer of momentum ensues when the waves break .",
    "the currents are also subjected to bottom / form drag , sea elevation gradients , etc .",
    "momentum transfers from the breaking wave field to the currents via @xmath3 in ( [ mom ] ) , can generate currents , however , we will assume in what follows that velocities thus so generated are inconsequential .",
    "the depth - dependence of the current will prove essential : the stokes drift drops off exponentially as a function of the depth .",
    "the velocity at @xmath31 , must satisfy @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the vertical and transverse three - dimensional and time dependent eulerian velocity components , respectively .",
    "( the boundary condition @xmath35 , applies to an inviscid flow ) .",
    "we assume that the wavenumber @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the unit transverse vector , pointing away from the beach . with this assumption , and ( [ waveac])-([groupvelo ] )",
    "it is understood that reflections from the shore are insignificant , thanks to dissipative processes embodied by @xmath38 .    since @xmath39 near the beach , the evolution of the depth - averaged tracer there is purely diffusive , by ( [ tracer ] ) .",
    "it is generally agreed that diffusivity is small outside of the breakzone .",
    "if the diffusivity near the shore were insignificant , there would be little change of the depth - averaged tracer distribution .",
    "however , the flow in the breakzone is complex . at",
    "the larger scales these turbulent and boundary layer effects manifest themselves as enhanced diffusivity and viscosity .",
    "in this paper , we propose a _",
    "kinematic _ model for oil transport in the nearshore , and in the model we include the following effects ( 1 ) a mean advective flow that is depth dependent and is shore directed on the surface , ( 2 ) a dispersion model that models the transport due to the fluctuating component of the velocity , and accounts for the enhanced diffusion in the break zone , ( 3 ) a simplified oil model which includes the effects of buoyant stratification of the oil into a surface slick and a bulk suspension , and ( 4 ) an exchange interaction which allows the bulk suspended oil to resurface and turbulence to entrain the surface oil into the bulk .",

    "the space - time evolution of the @xmath51 field is shown in figure [ sta ] ,    and figure   [ stb ] depicts the contours of @xmath51 .",
    "the dynamics of the oil slick and the interior oil are phase - locked because the vertical mixing is very rapid on the scale of the horizontal transport .",

    "figure [ evoa ] illustrates the slick @xmath87 , at four different times . for short times",
    ", the pulse is symmetric . for longer times",
    ", the pulse loses its symmetry , broadening more toward the beach due to a combination of the effective advection velocity @xmath115 , the enhanced turbulent diffusion @xmath100 in the near shore and the no - flux boundary condition .",

    "for comparison we superimpose a hypothetical _ ballistic _ trajectory , for oil traveling at speed @xmath64 .",
    "a slowdown of the pulse is evident .",
    "it begins to happen before the oil reaches the edge of the turbulent nearshore , which here spans @xmath183 $ ] m. since @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 are never zero ( _ cf .",

    "we also plot the ode model trajectories of the maximum and the center of mass .",
    "the agreement between the pde and ode trajectories is excellent .",
    "* case ii : * @xmath187 .",
    "as @xmath124 is decreased @xmath115 gets closer to @xmath91 and @xmath90 , which are smaller in magnitude than @xmath64 .",
    "this causes a slowdown of the center of mass of @xmath119 compared to the ballistic trajectory .",
    "( see figure [ evogamma - a ] . ) the oil , which started in the slick , transitions to the interior and the bulk of the oil in short order .",
    "we note the @xmath90 and @xmath115 for this case and the previous case are strictly negative , because @xmath179 ( see figure  [ veloc ] ) , so the maximum for @xmath87 and @xmath80 in the steady state is at @xmath29 ( see figure  [ pl2-a ] . )",
    "thus we expect the maxima to jump to zero , and this is borne out by simulations from the full model and also the reduced model , as depicted in figure  [ evogamma - a ] .",
    "* cases iii and iv : * @xmath188 and @xmath189 respectively . in these cases , @xmath131 at @xmath190 m ( inside the break zone ) and @xmath191 m ( outside the break zone ) , respectively .",
    "the effective velocity @xmath90 is positive on the shallow side of @xmath192 , as shown in figure  [ veloc ] and the effective velocity @xmath115 changes sign .",
    "the maximum for the steady states of @xmath80 are now in the interior of the domain , while the maximum for the steady states of @xmath87 remain at @xmath121 ( see figures  [ pl2-b]- ) .",
    "we thus predict that the maxima for @xmath87 will jump instantaneously , but the maxima for @xmath80 will remain away from the shore .",
    "this is indeed the case , for both the full and the reduced models as shown in figures  [ evogamma - b]- .    since @xmath193 , the initial pulse of oil in the slick transitions quickly to the interior , and remains there .",
    "also , the maximum of @xmath80 stays away from the shore , so this is an example of _ nearshore sticky waters_. the space - time evolution of @xmath53 is shown in figure  [ pl1 ] , showing the slowing and parking of the tracers in the bulk away from the shore .",
    "we wish to draw attention to the agreement between the pde and the ode models in figures  [ evogamma - b]- , even in situations where the ballistic and actual trajectories are very different .",
    "the model we propose describes , in a simple way , how buoyant contaminants that are impervious to inertial effects , may slow down as they approach nearshore environments .",
    "evidence of unusually long residence times for tracers , measured in breakzone field experiments , is reported from time to time ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanism depends on vertical variations of the tracer density and the cross - shore component of the velocity , and thus on buoyant stratification and topographic features , rather than on blocking or stationary structures in the lagrangian trajectories induced by the velocity field ( see @xcite , for details on lagrangian coherent structures ) .",
    "it is also different from the surface - wave deceleration mechanism outside of the surf zone , that is explored in @xcite .    the phenomenon and the dynamics detailed here should have relevance to the long - term transport of other contaminants and biological material in which inertial effects are negligible . in environmental mitigation problems the timing of landfall of pollutants and the manner in which these make it to land are crucial .",
    "we hope this simple model motivates efforts to improve forecasting circulation models for nearshore flows and transport , with better the modeling of breakzone boundary conditions , and nearshore subscale transport of pollutants .",
    "the proposed model ( section  [ sec : pde ] ) is a set of coupled pdes and , despite its relative simplicity , it has multiple , potentially relevant parameters ( see table 1 ) . in order to gain further insight into the dynamics of the pde model",
    ", we derived a finite dimensional reduction in section  [ sec : ode ] .",
    "we gain significant insight from studying the reduced model , namely we can explain the evolution of the vertical stratification of the oil density , the evolution of the oil density from symmetric to shoreward skewed distributions , the eventual fate of the maximum and the center of mass of the oil distribution , both in the surface and in the interior including an explanation of stickiness phenomenon , and a prediction for the time and space scales for the complex dynamics of the oil distribution .",
    "most importantly , the reduced model demonstrates that nearshore stickiness is a robust phenomenon , and helps identify the key parameters ( or combinations thereof ) which govern the gross behavior of the system .",
    "the determining factors are the two dimensionless quantities @xmath194 these quantities indicate the outcomes would change if the topographical parameters or the magnitude of the @xmath64 , @xmath52 , @xmath124 , and/or @xmath168 are changed .",
    "a general conclusion from our analysis is that increasing @xmath169 and/or increasing @xmath170 ( equivalently decreasing @xmath124 ) leads to more stickiness , _",
    "i.e _ , the oil approaches the shore more slowly and stalls near the break zone for much longer .",
    "the parameter @xmath169 depends on the topography of the nearshore , the sea conditions and the nature of the pollutant , as all of these influence @xmath52 .",
    "locations where the topography drops steeply even near the shore , such as in the southern california bight , will have small @xmath169 and are thus less  sticky . \"",
    "conversely a typical situation in the gulf of mexico or on the mid and southern portions of the atlantic us coast would have @xmath52 large when compared to @xmath195 , even at considerable distances from the shore , i.e. @xmath169 large , so the nearshore is considerably more  sticky . \"",
    "the parameter @xmath170 depends on the enhanced turbulent diffusivity @xmath168 in the breakzone as well as the parameter @xmath124 which governs the fraction of the oil which is in the slick .",
    "increasing the turbulent eddy diffusivity or decreasing the fraction of the total oil in the slick both lead to increased stickiness .",
    "the models we have developed have the virtue of simplicity and being analytically tractable , but they lack many of the ingredients of more realistic physical models . in particular we do not include inertial effects , and the transient setup and setdown process ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one expects the mixed layer to have a diffuse boundary unlike our simple model with a sharply discontinuous density at a constant layer depth @xmath52 .",
    "the mixed layer can depend on the sea state and the oil or pollutant constituents .",
    "for instance , the mixed layer depth and the concentration of the oil in suspension will tend to increase with langmuir turbulence and wave breaking activity .",
    "we use a kinematically specified flow with a parabolic profile , but a more realistic model should include a dynamical model for the ocean with a realistic vertical mean lagrangian velocity structure , at least close to the shore , as well as a careful treatment of the form - stress for the coupling of wind effects , which are recognized as very important in the case of surface oil slick dynamics ( see @xcite ) . finally , we have a simplified description of buoyancy and vertical mixing effects .",
    "these are important issues which we consider in a sequel to this paper .",
    "while these effects are relevant , we believe they will not change the basic conclusions we have drawn from the simplified model , and it gives a robust description of the mechanisms which can lead to the the observed apparent stalling of incoming pollutants approaching a shore .",
