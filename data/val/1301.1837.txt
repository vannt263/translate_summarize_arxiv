    "recent years have seen remarkable progress in our understanding of physical aging in non - disordered systems with slow , i.e. glassy - like , dynamics ( see @xcite for a recent comprehensive overview ) . in many systems , ranging from ferromagnets undergoing phase - ordering @xcite to reaction - diffusion systems @xcite",
    ", a single dynamical length @xmath1 , that grows as a power - law of time @xmath2 , governs the dynamics out of equilibrium . in the aging or dynamical scaling regime these systems are best characterized by two - times quantities , like dynamical correlation and response functions , that transform in a specific way under a dynamical scale transformation @xcite .",
    "the resulting dynamical scaling functions and the associated non - equilibrium exponents are often found to be universal and to depend only on some global features of the system under investigation .",
    "however , growth laws can be much more complicated , as discussed recently in disordered ferromagnets quenched below their critical temperature .",
    "thus , convincing evidence for a dynamic crossover between a transient regime , characterized by a power - law growth with an effective dynamical exponent that depends on the disorder , and the asymptotic regime , where the growth is logarithmic in time , has been found in recent studies of the dynamics of elastic lines in a random potential @xcite as well as in numerical simulations of disordered ising models @xcite .",
    "these indications are compatible with the classical ( droplet ) theory of activated dynamics that , under the assumption of energy barriers growing as a power of @xmath3 , predicts a slow logarithmic increase @xcite of this length : @xmath4 with the barrier exponent @xmath5 .",
    "whereas in some of the studies on disordered ising models aging phenomena in the crossover regime were investigated @xcite , none of these recent numerical studies was able to enter so deeply into the asymptotic regime that no corrections to the logarithmic growth law were detectable any more .",
    "therefore a systematic study of aging processes in this regime with pure logarithmic growth has not yet been done .    in this paper",
    "we study two one - dimensional models that exhibit anomalous slow dynamics and that are known to display coarsening where the length of the domains increases logarithmically with time @xcite . even though these models are in no way related to disordered ferromagnets and spin glasses",
    ", their studies should allow us to gain a better understanding of the generic properties of an aging system with a logarithmic growth law .",
    "the models discussed in the following are the so - called @xmath0 model @xcite , a driven diffusive system composed of three different types of particles that swap places asymmetrically , and a related domain model @xcite whose simplified dynamics is supposed to capture the dynamics of the @xmath0 model at the later stages of the coarsening process .",
    "the @xmath0 model has recently yielded a flurry of interesting studies @xcite that helped establishing it as a paradigm for systems far from equilibrium . not only is the @xmath0 model characterized by its anomalous slow dynamics , making it a representative for a larger class of systems with a similar coarsening process @xcite",
    ", it also exhibits a variety of interesting non - equilibrium phase transitions whose properties change dramatically when breaking certain conservation laws .",
    "the domain model has been proposed as a simplified version of the @xmath0 model where only movements of particles between domains of the some species are considered .",
    "this simplified dynamics accelerates the coarsening process and allows to enter the purely logarithmic growth regime faster @xcite . in the following we use the @xmath0 model in order to investigate the onset of dynamical",
    "scaling , whereas the domain model is used to characterize aging scaling deep inside the logarithmic growth regime .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss in more detail the two models that we study .",
    "section iii is devoted to the aging processes taking place in the @xmath0 model .",
    "we thereby focus on the two - times autocorrelation function where the two times are not always in the asymptotic , logarithmic scaling regime . in section",
    "iv we characterize aging scaling in the domain model through the study of both correlation and response functions .",
    "we discuss our results in section v.",
    "in the @xmath0 model particles of three different species live on a one - dimensional ring @xcite .",
    "every lattice site is occupied by exactly one particle , which can swap places with its left and right neighbors . in the symmetric case , where all exchanges happen with the same rate , every particle undergoes a random walk , and nothing interesting takes place . however , this changes dramatically as soon as one introduces a bias which makes the particles diffuse asymmetrically around the ring .",
    "this is achieved by randomly selecting a pair of neighboring sites and updating them using the following rates : @xmath6 with @xmath7 . as a result of these rules ,",
    "phase separation takes place in such a way that the ordered domains arrange themselves in repetitions of the sequence @xmath0 , where @xmath8 indicates a domain of @xmath8 particles , followed by a domain of @xmath9 particles , which itself is followed by a @xmath10 domain .",
    "once this arrangement has been achieved , the domains coarsen whereby the typical domain size increases logarithmically with time .",
    "obviously these exchanges keep constant the total number of particles of each species .",
    "we consider in our study only lattice sizes divisible by three and initially populate one third of the lattice sites by particles of each species . in that case",
    "detailed balance is fulfilled and the system evolves toward an equilibrium steady state @xcite .    in the domain model one focuses on the later stages of the coarsening process where well - defined , compact domains have already formed .",
    "one then defines a simplified dynamics where only events are taken into account that change the sizes of two neighboring domains of the same species .",
    "for example , consider the case where two such @xmath8 domains are selected , called @xmath11 and @xmath12 , that are separated by one @xmath9 and one @xmath10 domain , yielding the sequence @xmath13 . calling @xmath14 respectively @xmath15 the domain size of the domain @xmath11 respectively @xmath12 , these domain sizes are then modified in one of the following two ways @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 respectively @xmath18 are the number of sites of the @xmath9 respectively @xmath10 domain separating our two @xmath8 domains .",
    "these rates follow from the observation that in order to go from one domain to the other an @xmath8 particle has to cross one of the two intermediate domains in the ` wrong ' direction .",
    "the domain model therefore exclusively considers processes where particles successfully travel between domains of the same type , irrespective on how many jumps are needed for that transit .",
    "two - times quantities are well suited to study relaxation processes far from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we here briefly recall the expected behavior of such quantities , without entering into the details on how these quantities are computed for our driven diffusive systems .",
    "this will be done in the following sections when we discuss our numerical results .",
    "the two - times quantities usually at the center of aging studies are the autocorrelation function @xmath19 and the autoresponse function @xmath20 .",
    "the autocorrelation function measures the extend to which configurations taken at two different times @xmath21 and @xmath22 are correlated . here @xmath21 is the waiting time , whereas @xmath2 is called the observation time .",
    "the autoresponse function , on the other hand , allows us to investigate how the system reacts during the relaxation process to a instantaneous perturbation ( as for many other studies , we will focus below on the time integrated response to a longer lasting perturbation which is much easier to measure ) . in the aging regime , where the observation and waiting times are large",
    "compared to any microscopic time scale , the single growth length @xmath3 dominates the properties of the system , so that the different quantities should depend on time only through this length @xmath3 .",
    "thus one expects the following ( very general ) scaling forms , using standard notation @xcite : @xmath23 with the scaling functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 and the non - equilibrium exponents @xmath26 and @xmath17 . in systems undergoing coarsening one",
    "usually has @xmath27 and @xmath28 , but this can be different in other situations , as for example during non - equilibrium relaxation at a critical point @xcite . in cases with an algebraic growth law @xmath29 , as observed in critical systems or coarsening systems without disorder , one usually uses @xmath30 as scaling variable .",
    "however , for more complicated cases with subleading contributions to the growth and/or crossover between an initial algebraic growth and the true asymptotic behavior , this approach is too simplistic and @xmath31 has to be used as variable in order to achieve the expected scaling @xcite .",
    "in our simulations of the original @xmath0 model we focus on the early time regime where coarsening slowly sets in . we thereby always prepare the system in a disordered initial state with every species occupying one third of the lattice sites chosen at random .",
    "the data presented below have been obtained for rings with @xmath32 sites .",
    "this is large enough so that no finite size effects show up for the times accessed in our simulations , as we checked by making additional runs for other system sizes .",
    "we define one time step as @xmath33 proposed updates . for every proposed update we select a pair of neighboring sites at random and then exchange them with the rates given in ( [ eq : abc_rates ] ) .",
    "we start by having a look at the average domain size .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows @xmath1 for a large range of @xmath34 values .",
    "we note that in all cases an initial regime is observed during which domains are formed and arranged in the correct sequence , so that a @xmath10 domain follows a @xmath9 domain that follows an @xmath8 domain .",
    "this initial regime lasts longer for larger values of @xmath34 as it gets increasingly difficult to form these initial domains the closer @xmath34 gets to 1 .",
    "[ h ]   ( color online ) time - dependent average domain size for the @xmath0 model with various values of the rate @xmath34 .",

    "the slopes in the log - linear plot increase with @xmath34 .",
    "the data result from averaging over 600 independent runs . for small @xmath2 values ,",
    "the curves are ordered in such a way that the largest @xmath34 value corresponds to the lowest curve , whereas the smallest @xmath34 value yields the highest curve . for",
    "larger @xmath2 the curves start to cross , due to difference in slopes . in order to make this crossing better visible ,",
    "some selected data points are shown as symbols ( circles : @xmath35 , squares : @xmath36 , diamonds : @xmath37 ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    once these initial domains are formed , they then coarsen , and the system size increases logarithmically with time : @xmath38 . obviously , this is a very slow process and even after @xmath39 time steps the average domain size does not reach twenty lattice spacings . this coarsening proceeds faster for larger values of @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , the slopes in the log - linear plot decrease when decreasing @xmath34 .",
    "thus , in the interval between @xmath40 and @xmath41 we obtain that the slope continuously decreases from 1.05 for @xmath42 to 0.86 for @xmath37 .",
    "whereas at short times the domain size is the largest for the smallest @xmath34 value , we expect the order to be reversed for very long times , due to the difference in slopes .",
    "in fact , indications of this are already seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , see the two curves for @xmath37 and @xmath36 that start to be below some of the curves obtained for larger @xmath34 values .    a closer inspection of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the smallest @xmath34 values 0.2 and 0.3 reveals that their slopes change slightly with time .",
    "even after @xmath43 time steps we are for these @xmath34 values not yet completely inside the asymptotic regime where corrections to the logarithmic growth law should be completely absent .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , valuable insights into relaxation far from equilibrium can be gained through the study of two - times quantities . in this subsection",
    "we discuss the autocorrelation @xmath19 . for our three species system",
    "we characterize lattice site @xmath44 by a time - dependent potts variable @xmath45(alternatively we could use a species dependent occupation number @xcite ) that can take on the three different values 0 , 1 , or 2 , depending on whether at time @xmath2 the site is occupied by an @xmath8 , @xmath9 , or @xmath10 particle .",

    "[ fig2]a clearly differs from that observed for the larger waiting times . in fact , inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] reveals that @xmath52 lies in the time regime where the initial domains are forming and where coarsening starts to set in . as a result correlations dramatically change in the system , which is revealed by the non - monotonous behavior of the autocorrelation function .    in fig .",

    "we therefore focus in the following on the domain model with simplified dynamics that captures the essential properties of the @xmath0 model deep inside the coarsening regime while speeding up the dynamics @xcite .    for the domain model we consider systems with @xmath55 sites , thereby checking carefully that no finite - size effects affect our data for the times accessed in our simulations . as",

    "this is especially true for systems with competing ground states where phase coarsening dominates the out of equilibrium behavior in the ordered phase , thereby yielding a typical domain size that increases as a power - law of time .",
    "perfect magnets , as embodied by the ising or potts models , are well studied examples .",
    "however , as soon as one adds disorder and/or frustration effects , the dynamics slows down .",
    "a series of recent numerical studies @xcite have confirmed the existence of a crossover from an initial power - law like regime to an asymptotic regime where the relevant length scale increases much slower with time . even though it is expected that this long time regime is characterized by logarithmic growth , none of the studies in which the time evolution of the system was followed were able to fully enter this asymptotic regime .",
    "consequently , most of the non - equilibrium relaxation properties in such a regime have not yet been explored .",
    "motivated by the absence of systematic studies of aging in system with logarithmic growth , we propose to follow a different route and to focus on model systems for which it is possible to access the logarithmic regime . even though these models are not related to disordered magnetic systems ,",
    "their study should allow us to gain a better understanding of the more universal properties encountered in this regime .    in this paper",
    "we have studied the @xmath0 model and a related domain model with a simplified dynamics .",
    "the @xmath0 model allows us to study the crossover from an early time regime to the logarithmic regime . the domain model , on the other hand",
    ", very rapidly displays a logarithmic growth of the domains .",
    "therefore , using this model we can test the scaling behavior of two - times quantities like correlation and response functions .",
    "our study shows that in the crossover regime the correlation function can be rather complicated .",
    "once the domains are formed and coarsening proceeds , one enters the logarithmic regime where for waiting times large enough the two - time autocorrelation starts to exhibit a scaling behavior .",
    "this scaling behavior is fully elucidated when studying the domain model . in that case",
    "we find for the autocorrelation function a standard aging scaling , provided that the time dependence is expressed through the length scale @xmath1 that increases logarithmically with time .    in order to study the response of the system to a perturbation",
    ", we keep the swapping rate @xmath34 , the only parameter in the model , at some initial value @xmath68 up to the waiting time @xmath21 , where we then change this rate and set it equal to the final value @xmath69 .",
    "we then compare the time evolution of the domains formed using this protocol with that of the domains that are formed when from the start the rate is set equal to @xmath69 .",
    "the response function is then a time integrated global response to a global change in the system .",
    "interestingly , we find different types of behavior , depending on whether the rate is decreased or increased at the waiting time . if the rate is decreased , then the difference between the domain sizes of the perturbed and unperturbed systems decreases logarithmically with time .",
    "this then yields again a simple aging scaling with the typical length @xmath1 as scaling variable , in complete analogy to the behavior of the autocorrelation function .",
    "this is completely different when considering the case where @xmath34 is increased . in that case",
    "the domains of the perturbed system grow very fast and rapidly approach the size of the unperturbed system , yielding a regime where the approach to the unperturbed regime displays an effective power - law behavior , with effective exponents that depend on the waiting time .",
    "consequently , no dynamical scaling is observed in that case .",
    "we view the present study as a first step in the systematic study of aging properties of systems undergoing logarithmic growth .",
    "we expect additional important insights through the study of space - time quantities , like the two - times space - time correlation function .",
    "also , up to now we restricted ourselves to the global response to a global change . in future , this should be extended to the investigation of the local response to a local perturbation .",
    "the two models studied here have of course no direct relation with the magnetic systems that motivated our study .",
    "still , we expect that some of the results obtained in our study should also remain valid for magnetic systems with logarithmic growth .",
    "this is especially true for the simple aging scaling with the scaling variable @xmath31 that is found for the autocorrelation .",
    "we expect that this is a general feature of systems undergoing anomalous slow dynamics that is characterized by a logarithmic growth of the typical domain size , including the disordered ferromagnets .",
    "future studies of other systems displaying this type of growth should be able to substantiate this statement .",
    "less obvious for us is whether the intriguing behavior encountered for the global response function is also a generic property . for the disordered ferromagnet the corresponding protocol would consist in letting the system relax in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath104",
    ", whose value is then changed after the waiting time ( this final value could of course be @xmath105 ) .",
    "we then should again have that the domains at the waiting time have a different typical length when compared with the domain size at constant magnetic field .",
    "the situation therefore seems rather similar to what is discussed in this paper .",
    "still , the domains in two- and three - dimensional ferromagnets are very different to the pure domains encountered in the domain model .",
    "it therefore remains an intriguing question for the future whether responses in other systems with anomalous slow dynamics behave in a similar way to what has been found in our study .",
