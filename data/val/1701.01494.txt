    "seiringer @xcite proved that a vortex configuration with charge @xmath9 becomes energetically favorable to a vortex configuration with charge @xmath10 for a frequency above the @xmath9-th critical value and that radially symmetrically vortices with charge @xmath11 can not be global minimizers of energy .",
    "the questions on how the @xmath9 individual vortices of charge one are placed near the center of symmetry to form an energy minimizer remain open since the time of @xcite .    for the vortex of charge one",
    ", it is shown by using variational approximations @xcite and bifurcation methods @xcite that the construction of energy minimizers is not trivial past the threshold value for the rotation frequency , where the radially symmetric vortex becomes a local minimizer of energy .",
    "namely , in addition to the radially symmetric vortex , which exists for all rotation frequencies , there exists another branch of the asymmetric vortex solutions above the threshold value , which are represented by a vortex of charge one displaced from the center of rotating symmetric trap .",
    "the distance from the center of the harmonic trap increases with respect to the detuning rotation frequency above the threshold value , whereas the angle is a free parameter of the asymmetric vortex solutions .",
    "although the asymmetric vortex is not a local energy minimizer , it is nevertheless a constrained energy minimizer , for which the constraint eliminates the rotational degree of freedom and defines the angle of the solution family uniquely . consequently , both radially symmetric and asymmetric vortices are orbitally stable in the time evolution of the gross  pitaevskii equation for the rotating frequency slightly above the threshold value @xcite .",
    "further results on the stability of equilibrium configurations of several vortices of charge one in rotating harmonic traps were found numerically , from the predictions given by the finite - dimensional system for dynamics of individual vortices @xcite .",
    "the two - vortex equilibrium configuration arises again above the threshold value for the rotation frequency with the two vortices of charge one being located symmetrically with respect to the center of the harmonic trap .",
    "however , the symmetric vortex pair is stable only for small distances from the center and it losses stability for larger distances . once it becomes unstable",
    ", another asymmetric pair of two vortices bifurcate , where one vortex has a smaller - than - critical distance from the center and the other vortex has a larger - than - critical distance from the center .",
    "the asymmetric pair is stable in numerical simulations and coexist for rotating frequencies above the threshold value with the stable symmetric vortex pair located at the smaller - than - critical distances @xcite .",

    "symmetries of nonlinear terms were used to continue families of general vortex and dipole solutions from the linear limit by contreras and garca - azpeitia @xcite by using equivariant degree theory @xcite and bifurcation methods @xcite .",
    "existence and stability of stationary states were analyzed in @xcite with the amplitude equations for the hermite function decompositions and their truncation at the continuous resonant equation .",

    "numerical evidences of existence , bifurcations , and stability of such vortex and dipole solutions can be found in a vast literature @xcite .",

    "therefore , we consider bifurcations of _ secondary branches _ of multi - vortex solutions from the primary branch of the radially symmetric vortex of charge @xmath3 .",
    "the primary branch is parameterized by only one parameter @xmath17 in the small - amplitude limit , whereas the secondary branches of multi - vortex configurations are parameterized by two parameters @xmath18 and @xmath1 .    as a particular example",

    "similarly to the symmetric vortex of charge two @xcite , the asymmetric pair of two vortices of charge one is born unstable but it is more energetically favorable near the bifurcation threshold compared to the charge - two vortex in the case of no rotation ( @xmath21 ) . if the vortex of charge two is a saddle point of the energy @xmath22 in ( [ energy ] ) with three pairs of negative eigenvalues for @xmath21 , it has only one pair of negative eigenvalues for @xmath1 below but near @xmath20 .",
    "we note that the bifurcation technique developed here is not feasible by the methods developed in @xcite because of the infinitely many resonances at @xmath23 .",
    "nevertheless , we show that these resonances are resolved for @xmath1 below but near @xmath23 .    for a charge - one vortex , a similar bifurcation happens for @xmath1 below but near @xmath20 , which has been already described in @xcite in other notations and with somewhat formal analysis .",
    "the results developed here allows us to give a full justification of the results of @xcite for a vortex of charge one , but also to give an extended result for the vortex of charge two , as well as for a radially symmetric vortex of a general charge @xmath3 .",
    "we also consider all other secondary bifurcations of the radially symmetric vortices of charge @xmath3 when the frequency parameter @xmath1 is increased from zero in the interval @xmath24 .",
    "we show that each bifurcation results in the disappearance of a single pair of negative eigenvalues in the characterization of radially symmetric vortices as saddle points of the energy @xmath22 in ( [ energy ] ) .    as a particular example",
    ", we show that the symmetric vortex of charge two has a bifurcation at @xmath1 near @xmath25 , where another secondary branch bifurcates .",
    "the new branch contains three vortices of charge one at the vertices of an equilateral triangle and a vortex of anti - charge one at the center of symmetry .",
    "again , the secondary branch inherits instability of the radially symmetric vortex along the primary branch in the small - amplitude limit . past the bifurcation point , the radially symmetric vortex of charge two has two pairs of negative eigenvalues .",
    "the bifurcation result near @xmath25 was not obtained in the previous work @xcite .    in the case of the multi - vortex configurations of the total charge two",
