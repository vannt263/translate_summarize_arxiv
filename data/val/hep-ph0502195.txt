    "the higgs mechanism is the means by which the electroweak symmetry is broken in the standard model ( sm ) and in the minimally supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "the mssm has two higgs doublets which are used to generate the masses of the up- and down - type quarks .",
    "this leads to five physical higgs bosons .",
    "these consist of two cp - even neutral scalar bosons ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) , one cp - odd neutral pseudoscalar ( @xmath0 ) , and two charged bosons ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the extended higgs sector has several new parameters that can be determined with the input of two parameters , the mass of the pseudoscalar @xmath7 and @xmath8 given reasonable assumptions as to the size of the other supersymmetric parameters in the theory .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the up and down sectors .",
    "we are interested in the phenomenology of the pseudoscalar higgs boson at a future international linear collider , in particular , what the heavy squark contributions can tell us about the phenomenology .",
    "there have been many studies of pseudoscalar higgs boson phenomenology@xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of the pseudoscalar higgs produced in association with a @xmath1 boson at a hadron collider ( such as the tevatron and the cern lhc ) has also been studied@xcite , as well as at a future international linear collider ( ilc)@xcite . there have been some studies of the decays of higgs bosons into squarks@xcite that show how large these processes can become , but squark contributions are rarely taken into account for pseudoscalar higgs processes . in this paper",
    "we will discuss squark contributions to processes involving the production and decay of a pseudoscalar higgs boson which have been missing from the literature thus far .",
    "the construction of an ilc would greatly enhance our ability to measure the parameters in many new physics scenarios@xcite including the mssm .",
    "the process @xmath10  at an ilc is interesting because it has the possibility of four bottom quarks in the final state allowing for precise measurements of the process as well as many other excellent final states .",
    "this process is also interesting because it could compete with the @xmath11  process .",
    "the @xmath10  process occurs at the one loop level because the pseudoscalar higgs boson does not couple to vector bosons at tree level .",
    "this process also allows for the exploration of squark mixing for the heaviest two generations of squarks .",
    "we find that the dominant contributions to the @xmath10  process does not come from top and bottom quark loops .",
    "we find that the squark contributions to the @xmath10  process are relevant at all values of @xmath8 and although they depend on the mixing in the stop and sbottom squark sectors , they dominate over the standard model field contributions due to the large coupling of the pseudoscalar to squarks .",
    "we find that the pseudoscalar decay @xmath12  has significant contributions from the squark sector and that the @xmath12  branching ratio becomes more important for large values of the mass of the pseudoscalar .",
    "we also find that the @xmath2  decay squark has contributions on the order of the quark contributions for a light pseudoscalar higgs at large values of @xmath8 .",
    "overall , squark contributions need to be added to processes involving neutral higgs bosons to complete our understanding of their phenomenology .",
    "in the sm , quarks generically couple to the pseudoscalar higgs boson as @xmath13 . beyond this base coupling ,",
    "the up- and down - type quarks couple to the pseudoscalar differently .",
    "up - type quarks couple as @xmath14 and down - type quarks couple as @xmath8 , leading to the well - known conclusion that bottom quarks become more important at large values of @xmath8 .",
    "this is also true in the stop / sbottom sectors .",
    "the sbottom squarks become more important as @xmath8 becomes large .    in the mssm ,",
    "right and left handed quarks , @xmath15 , have scalar super - partners , @xmath16 .",
    "we are interested in the stop and sbottom squarks ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the squark sector of the mssm has the possibility for squarks to mix into mass eigenstates that are different than the usual left - right basis .",
    "we can introduce a mixing angle that diagonalizes the squarks into their mass eigenstates .",
    "this can be written generically for the new squark eigenstates @xmath18 as@xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mixing angles in each of the squark sectors .",
    "squark mixing is particularly interesting when it comes to the squark loop contributions for pseudoscalar higgs production . in the left - right basis , the pseudoscalar higgs couples only to squarks that change their handedness at the vertex leaving only vertices such as @xmath22 .",
    "however it is now easy to see that in the presence of squark mixing , vertices of the type @xmath23 for all values of @xmath24 are present and retain the size of the @xmath25 vertex times a function of the new mixing angle .",
    "this is also true of other neutral higgs bosons in the mssm , but the analysis is more complicated as there are more vertices present for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 higgs bosons .    in this model ,",
    "all of the pseudoscalar higgs vertices in the squark sector are proportional to the squark mixing angles .",
    "thus the mixing angles regulate the squark contribution to any pseudoscalar higgs process .",
    "it is possible to tune the mixing angles @xmath26 and @xmath27 to eliminate all but one of these vertices .",
    "for instance if @xmath28 , then only the @xmath29 vertex remains and it is maximal .",
    "it is easy to see in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : mix ] ) that this would correspond to being back in the left - right basis .",
    "the mixing angles themselves are not completely independent from the other parameters in the mssm .",
    "we can write the mixing angles as @xmath30 here @xmath31 are the tri - linear scalar couplings for soft supersymmetry breaking in the mssm lagrangian and @xmath32 is the supersymmetry breaking higgs mass parameter in the super potential .",
    "we can see that there is more splitting in the stop sector as it is proportional to the top quark mass which is much larger than the bottom quark mass .",
    "this is a general feature of squark mixing . in our analysis",
    "we picked @xmath33  tev in both the stop and sbottom sectors and generated @xmath34 using the other parameters in the theory for an arbitrary mixing angle allowing us to study the mixing in the squark sector .",
    "thus we always have @xmath35 in the stop sector .",
    "this is the standard ordering for squark masses .",
    "our choices for squark masses are well beyond current experimental limits@xcite and we have chosen such heavy squarks to make our results more conservative .",
    "the other parameters in the theory were chosen to be @xmath36  gev and @xmath37  gev .",
    "of course , the squark contributions to the process depend on the mass of the squarks and lighter squarks lead to larger contributions to any process involving them . in choosing @xmath38  tev",
    "we find maximal mixing in the squark sector leads to the lightest masses for the second quark .",
    "although , our results show a very complicated dependence on these mixing angles , the dominant effect of the supersymmetric contributions are seen when the squarks are the lightest as is to be expected .",
    "these mass relations are tree level relations and the corrections to the mixing angles are known in the literature@xcite . however , since we are interested in studying the effects of the squark mixing on our observables , it is unclear how to incorporate these corrections to produce squark masses that obey specific mixing angles .",
    "the effects of these higher order corrections are the most pronounced in the sbottom sector and future studies should be completed on this subject .",
    "we have used the @xmath39 running - mass of the bottom quark in our generation of the second sbottom squark mass .",

    "the results of the application of the squark mixing to the pseudoscalar vertices can be found in table  [ tbl : feynman ] .",
    "the coupling of the squarks to the pseudoscalar can be written as @xmath57 where @xmath58  gev is the higgs vev and we have chosen sign@xmath59 implicitly in our choice of couplings .",
    "the squark contributions to pseudoscalar higgs processes are often missing in the literature and were believed to be quite small because they are loop suppressed and the squark would be very heavy if they exist in nature .",
    "although this is certainly a possibility given the right parameter choice , the pseudoscalar coupling to squarks is quite large and is not entirely suppressed by the heavy squark loops .",
    "this is due to the fact that the pseudoscalar couples to right- and left - handed squarks only in a non - diagonal way . in the mssm ,",
    "the non - diagonal squark vertices with any neutral higgs boson ( @xmath60 ) , written here as @xmath61 , is proportional to the tri - linear soft - supersymmetry breaking parameter multiplied by the same factor as the coupling in the quark sector modulo any mixing angles that may also be present at the vertex . for the pseudoscalar higgs",
    ", there are no mixing angles present , just @xmath8 or @xmath14 depending on the nature of the squark .",
    "this could also increase this effect in the sbottom sector once the difference in the masses between the top and bottom quarks is overcome .",
    "therefore the squark - squark - higgs coupling is potentially greatly enhanced compared to the quark - quark - higgs coupling , so much so as to overcome the loop suppression and the heavy squark masses to become the dominant contribution .",
    "if we consider the top / stop sector as an illustration , the importance of the squark contributions will become clear .",
    "the vertex @xmath62 and the dominant contribution to the vertex @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the squark vertex is as large at the quark vertex times a large factor , in our case @xmath64  gev for @xmath65 .",
    "this factor of @xmath66 is squared in a cross - section or width and gives an overall factor of @xmath67 .",
    "we have picked squarks with masses on the order of a tev ( about five times the mass of the top quark ) which deceases the cross - section or width by an order of magnitude when compared to a squark with a mass lowered to that of the top quark .",
    "so navely we would consider the squark contributions to be larger than the quark contributions by a factor of @xmath68 .",
    "this is exactly what we have found for the @xmath10  process and the @xmath12  width .",
    "there are some cancellations in the @xmath2  width leading to a result that is on the same order as the contributions from the sm fields for some values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that this is the case for the non - diagonal squark vertices in the entire neutral higgs sector of the mssm .",
    "the @xmath69 and @xmath70 should show similar enhancements with some additional dependence on the mixing angles @xmath71 .",
    "the squark loop processes involving the production of these particles could very well be larger than the tree - level production processes and could lead to better bounds on squark masses or trilinear soft - supersymmetry breaking terms from the lep2 data for the production of the other neutral higgs bosons in the mssm .",
    "it should be noted that this is partially an arbitrary enhancement because we have chosen the soft - supersymmetry breaking parameters to be large . however ,",
    "if the soft breaking terms exist in nature , they will enhance the squark - squark - higgs vertex over that of the quark - quark - higgs vertex proportionately to their size . with this information we are ready to construct the matrix elements for our decays @xmath2  and @xmath12  and our process @xmath10 .",
    "to understand the @xmath10  process , we calculated the three point functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 with both top and bottom quarks and stop and sbottom squarks .",
    "a generic representation of the three - point functions can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : decay ] ) .",
    "the contributions from the top and bottom quarks were checked against known results@xcite .",
    "we also checked our calculation with the known partial width for @xmath74 as given by hdecay@xcite .",
    "we found excellent agreement .",
    "we also found that due to the tensor structure of the quark and squark contributions , the two processes do not interfere with each other .",
    "the exact form of the contributions is worked out in the appendix and it is shown explicitly that the two contributions do not mix .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the differential cross - sections for a future ilc are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : sigma ] ) .",
    "the squark contributions can be seen for the two different center - of - mass energies ( @xmath75  gev and @xmath43  tev ) .",
    "the quark contributions are not shown because they are several orders of magnitude smaller than the squark contributions which are on the order of @xmath76  fb for @xmath77  gev and @xmath65 .",
    "the contributions from the sm fields and the mssm fields would not have mixed in any of the processes in this paper due to their tensor structure , as described in the appendix .",
    "the differential cross - section is symmetric with respect to the scattering angle @xmath78 and with the interchange of the kinematic variables @xmath79 .",
    "in conclusion , we have found that the dominant contributions to the @xmath10  process does not come from top and bottom quark loops .",
    "the extreme enhancement of the pseudoscalar higgs - squark - squark vertices due to the trilinear soft - supersymmetry breaking terms make the squark loops the dominant contribution to this process .",
    "this result is generically true in the entire neutral higgs sector of the mssm .",
    "based on these results , squark loops appear to play a very large roll in higgs phenomenology in the neutral sector .",

    "the matrix elements for the process @xmath10  has implicit in it two one - loop three - point functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we constructed these two three - point functions with quark and squark contributions for the collider process and to understand the squark contributions to our decay widths .",
    "there are also four box - type quark diagrams that have not been discussed so far and are not related to the three - point functions analyzed in this paper .",
    "these were included in our analysis but they are not part of the squark sectors for which explicit results will be presented and are negligible in size to the sm contributions .",
    "the matrix elements for the rare pseudoscalar decays @xmath80 and @xmath12 can be written as the sum of two parts .",
    "these are one loop decays that can have standard model fields and supersymmetric fields in the loops .",
    "the standard model and supersymmetric contributions do not mix due to their tensor structure .",
    "the supersymmetric diagrams can be broken into two form factors based on gauge invariance , for the @xmath81 decay we can write the one - loop @xmath72 vertex with squark loops as @xmath82    the @xmath73 one - loop vertex will take the same form , but will have different coefficients ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) .",
    "there is no term that is proportional to the @xmath85 tensor in the squark loops because the pseudoscalar does not couple to squarks with a @xmath86 .",
    "however , this is the case when there are standard model fields in the loop .",
    "therefore , the same @xmath72 vertex with quark loops can be written as @xmath87 when we try to interfere these two vertices it is now easy to see that we find zero due to a repeated index in the @xmath85 tensor in the first term and a term anti - symmetric in the indices multiplied by one symmetric in the indices in the second term .",
    "therefore , the decay widths will be additive for these processes .",
    "this is also true for the differential cross - section .",
    "thus we can write @xmath88    this leads to some interesting phenomenology .",
    "it needs to be noted that the pseudoscalar higgs boson does not appear in the standard model , thus the standard model contributions listed here are the contributions from the standard model fields , in this case , the top and bottom quarks .",
    "thus deviations from the sm contributions do not tell us about the existence of supersymmetry in nature , but they do tell us about the mixing in the squark sector directly .    when we add all the squark loop diagrams we can determine the unknown coefficients in our vertices .",
