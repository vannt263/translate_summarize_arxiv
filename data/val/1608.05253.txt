    "discussed the intriguing possibility to connect two distant regions within a single universe @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this kind of wormholes does not allow for their passage @xcite .",
    "transversable wormholes in general relativity were first obtained by ellis @xcite and bronnikov @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . however , these need the presence of a new kind of matter field coupled to gravity .",
    "such a phantom field carries the wrong sign in front of its kinetic term , and consequently its energy - momentum tensor violates the null energy condition .",
    "the conditions for the existence of traversable wormholes as well as the properties of such static wormholes were discussed later in detail by morris and thorne @xcite , who addressed also the possibility of time - travel @xcite .    while phantom fields have been employed frequently in cosmology in recent years , since they give rise to an accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite , it was also pointed out @xcite , that the presence of a phantom field can be evaded in the construction of wormholes , when gravity theories with higher curvature terms are considered .",

    "we then give a discussion of the geometric properties of the wormholes , in particular , we define the position of the throat as a minimal surface , and we demonstrate the violation of the energy conditions .",
    "subsequently in section iii we present our numerical results for symmetric wormholes , i.e. , those wormholes whose global charges are the same on both sides of the wormhole .",
    "these wormholes then possess one less parameter . in particular",
    ", we consider families of wormhole configurations for fixed equatorial throat radius , and demonstrate that these solutions approach an extremal kerr black hole , as the angular momentum tends towards its maximal value .",
    "we then exhibit embeddings of wormhole spacetimes and demonstrate , that the gaussian curvature of the throat turns negative at the poles , when the rotation is sufficiently fast , analogously to the curvature of the horizon of kerr black holes .",
    "finally , we examine the effective potential and the geodesics of rotating wormholes , which in contrast to static ellis wormholes allow for bound orbits .",
    "non - symmetric rotating wormholes are presented in section iv .",
    "they depend on three parameters , and have distinct properties when the asymmetry parameter @xmath0 is negative or positive .",
    "we analyze the domain of existence of these non - symmetric wormholes , and demonstrate that the families of non - symmetric wormholes also approach an extremal kerr black hole .",
    "we then address the somewhat surprising fact , that the rotational velocity of the throat can exceed the velocity of light for positive @xmath0 .",
    "we show how the location of the throat changes as the asymmetry of the solutions is varied . finally , we consider embeddings of non - symmetric wormholes and geodesics in these spacetimes .",

    "however , whereas the motion there looks like prograde motion in our coordinates , where the @xmath236 universe is asymptotically flat , it corresponds to retrograde motion , when an appropriate coordinate transformation is performed , making the @xmath238 universe asymptotically flat .",
    "+    of particular interest are the innermost stable circular orbits ( iscos ) . to find the circular orbits we need to solve for @xmath239 , while stability requires at the same time @xmath240 .",

    "is located at small positive @xmath263 , while for positive @xmath0 it resides at small negative @xmath263 .",
    "we observe that , in contrast to the throat location @xmath263 , the throat radius @xmath103 depends strongly on @xmath0 , and increases with increasing @xmath0 .    in boyer - lindquist coordinates ,",
    "the event horizon of a rotating black hole is characterized by a single value of the radial coordinate .",
    "likewise , the throat of a symmetric rotating wormhole is characterized by a single value of the radial coordinate .",
    "let us now see , whether an analogous result holds for the throat of a non - symmetric rotating wormhole . to that end",
    "we analyze the coordinates of the minimal surface defining the throat .",
    "in particular , we calculate the value of the radial throat coordinate @xmath264 as a function of the polar angle @xmath11 , and find only a very slight dependence of @xmath264 on @xmath11 . for instance",

    ", we can state that a constant @xmath264 represents at least a good approximation . from a geometrical point of view , however , the throat is highly deformed for a fast rotating wormhole .",
    "+    as our last quest let us address the trajectories of particles and light in these non - symmetric rotating wormhole spacetimes . as in the symmetric case we find stable bound orbits of massive particles and unstable bound orbits of massless particles",
    ". however , we now focus on the orbits of particles in wormhole spacetimes , whose equatorial throat velocity @xmath143 exceeds the speed of light , since this is a new phenomenon as compared to the symmetric case . as an example , we exhibit in fig .",

    "[ fig16]a shows the orbits in an embedding of the wormhole spacetime , while fig .",
    "[ fig16]b gives a projection of the orbits in the equatorial plane .",
    "in such a spacetime the particle orbits appear rather strange at first sight . moving with zero angular momentum in the negative @xmath10 region towards the throat ,",
    "the particle orbits are strongly dragged along by the rapidly rotating space time until the particles pass the throat . beyond the throat",
    "the particles then follow more or less straight lines , as they move across the positive @xmath10 region towards infinity .",
    "in this region the function @xmath9 decreases rapidly outside the throat and vanishes asymptotically .",
    "so the dragging of the radial geodesics diminishes fast , when away from the throat .",
    "the construction of lorentzian rotating wormholes , which are generalizations of the ellis wormholes , has been a challenge for a very long time . with this study",
    "we have provided the first detailed investigation of rotating ellis wormholes in general relativity .",
    "these wormhole solutions are supported by a phantom field , and can be either symmetric or non - symmetric .",
    "whereas the static solutions are known in closed form , the non - perturbative rotating wormholes have been obtained by numerical integration of the coupled system of einstein - phantom equations , subject to appropriate boundary conditions . the latter guarantee that the solutions are globally regular and asymptotically flat on one side , while for the second side a coordinate transformation is necessary to achieve asymptotic flatness .",
    "the global charges of the wormhole solutions can be obtained from their asymptotic expansions . for symmetric wormholes",
    "the mass is the same on both sides of the wormhole .",
    "the same holds true for the angular momentum .",
    "however , this is no longer the case , when the asymmetry parameter @xmath0 differs from zero .",
    "the throat of symmetric wormholes resides at the center of our coordinate system , where the radial coordinate @xmath10 is zero .",
    "the corresponding surface represents a minimal surface , which changes from a round sphere in the static limit to a strongly deformed axially symmetric surface with negative gaussian curvature at the poles , when the rotational velocity becomes sufficiently high . for non - symmetric wormholes the minimal surface defining the throat",
    "may still be described by a surface of constant radial coordinate @xmath10 ( at least within our numerical accuracy ) .",
    "but , depending on the sign of the asymmetry parameter @xmath0 , the location of the throat is shifting towards positive or negative values of @xmath10",
    ".    many of the properties revealed by our calculations are rather surprising , for instance ,    * rotating wormholes satisfy a smarr type relation , * rotating wormholes possess an extremal kerr black hole as limiting configuration , * for rotating wormholes the crossing from positive to negative gaussian curvature at the poles of the throat occurs precisely at the same ratio of radii as for kerr black holes , * the dimensionless quadrupole moment of rotating wormholes can strongly exceed the kerr value , * the ergoregion of the rotating wormholes is very different from the expectations raised by the teo wormhole , * non - symmetric wormholes can possess a rotational velocity of the throat which exceeds the speed of light , * unlike the static ellis wormholes , the rotating wormholes do possess bound orbits .",
    "furthermore , we conjecture that the observations that ( i ) the violation of the nec decreases with increasing global charge , while ( ii ) the wormholes approach an extremal black hole solution as a limiting configuration , represent generic features of wormholes . for the present study ,",
    "the global charge is angular momentum , and the extremal black hole corresponds to a kerr black hole . as shown before , electrically charged static ellis wormholes in four dimensions approach with increasing charge in an analogous fashion an extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite , while rotating wormholes ( with equal angular momenta ) in five dimensions tend with increasing angular momenta towards the corresponding extremal myers - perry black hole @xcite .",
    "so far we have not addressed the important issue of the stability of these rotating wormhole solutions .",
    "it has been shown before , that the static ellis wormholes are unstable , both in four @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , arguments have been given which indicate that wormholes might be stabilized by rotation @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the case of five - dimensional rotating wormholes it has been shown , that the unstable mode of the static solutions disappears , when the rotation is sufficiently fast @xcite .",
    "we are planning to do the corresponding stability analysis also for four - dimensional rotating wormholes , to see whether rotation will eliminate the unstable mode as well in four dimensions . on the other hand , stability of wormholes",
    "could also be achieved , when the einstein - hilbert action of general relativity is replaced by a more general action with higher curvature terms @xcite .",
