    "the galactic x - ray transient source grs  1915 + 105 has shown spectacular x - ray variability during last four years of its observation by rxte and other satellites ( greiner et al .",
    "1996 , yadav et al . 1999 ,",
    "belloni et al .",
    "this source was discovered in 1992 with the watch all sky x - ray monitor onboard the granat satellite ( castro - tirado et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the x - ray intensity was found to vary on a variety of time scales and the light curve showed a complicated pattern of dips and rapid transitions between high and low intensity ( belloni et al .",
    "1997 , taam et al .",
    "recently , yadav et al . ( 1999 ) have made a detailed study of various types of x - ray bursts seen in grs  1915 + 105 from ixae / ppcs observations during 1997 june - august and have suggested that during the bursts the source switches back and forth between the low - hard state and the high - soft state near critical accretion rates in a very short time scale .",
    "the fast time scale for the transition of the state is explained by invoking the appearance and disappearance of the advective disk in its viscous time scale .",

    ". q. flux= average quiescent time flux ( c / s ) , var . = variable @xmath0 mean asm flux ( c / s ) for a day , @xmath1 mean burst recurrence time    in this paper , we present results of our analysis of a set of publicly available rxte / pca observations of grs 1915 + 105 during last four years which samples a broad range of burst cycles from 30 s to 1300 s. each burst cycle consists of a low flux quiescent phase followed by a high flux burst phase and the fast transition in less than 10 s. we include here only those bursts which have dips or quiescent phase with hard spectrum ( yadav 2001 , yadav & rao 2001 ) .",
    "we have selected a set of observations from publicly available rxte / pca data for the x - ray transient source grs 1915 + 105 ( jahoda et al .",
    "the source was in high / flaring state during these observations .",
    "the dips or the quiescent phase in these observations are spectrally hard while the brighter portions ( the burst phase ) are soft .",
    "a portion of 2@xmath213 kev light curves for different days added for all pca units ( except on 1996 april 6 , when only three pca units were on ) , are shown in figure 1 . in table 1 we list details of these observations alongwith some of the properties of the observed x - ray bursts . during these observations",
    "asm flux varies from 47 to 100 asm c / s while the quiescent time flux varies in the range of 3000@xmath210000 c / s ( added for 5 pca units ) in the 2@xmath213 kev energy range .",
    "these bursts can broadly be put into two classes : regular bursts centered around a fixed period with low dispersion ( @xmath3 ) and irregular bursts with no fixed periodicity ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the observed bursts are classified into four types : ( 1 ) regular bursts ( r1 ) with short burst phase lasting for @xmath5 20 s and recurring every 50@xmath2145 s ( extreme ends of this type are shown in first and second panels from top of figure 1 ( r1a type and r1b type respectively ) , for other bursts of this type see vilhu & nevalainen ( 1998 ) ) .",
    "these bursts have lowest dispersion ( @xmath6 ) , ( 2 ) regular bursts ( r2 ) with short quiescent phase lasting for        fig .",
    "1 . the regular bursts with @xmath5 55 s recurrence time ( first panel from the top ) , regular bursts with @xmath5 105 s recurrence time ( second panel ) , regular bursts with @xmath5 280 s ( third panel ) , regular bursts with @xmath5 1150 s recurrence time ( fourth panel ) , and irregular bursts ( fifth panel ) observed in grs  1915 + 105 with all the pcas except on 1996 april 6 when only three pca units were on .",
    "@xmath5 20 s recurring every 280 s ( third panel from top ) .",
    "the @xmath7 is upto 50% for these bursts , ( 3 ) long regular bursts ( r3 ) recurring every 1150 s ( fourth panel from top ) .",
    "the @xmath7 is upto 15% for these bursts , and",
    "( 4 ) irregular bursts ( ir ) with duration of a few tens to a few hundred seconds ( bottom panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "the regular bursts with short burst phase usually have two - peak structure while irregular and long regular bursts show multi - peak structure with higher variability near the end of the burst .",
    "the most striking features of these bursts are slow exponential rise , sharp linear decay and hardening of spectrum as burst progresses ( paul et al .",
    "the decay time scales are shorter than the rise time scales . in sharp contrast",
    ", the decay time is longer than the rise time in classical bursts and spectrum is initially hard and becomes softer as the burst decays .",
    "the ratio of luminosity in type i x - ray bursts ( @xmath8 ) and the average quiescent x - ray luminosity ( @xmath9 ) is @xmath10 .",
    "the time - averaged type ii burst luminosity is higher , usually 0.4 to 2.2 times the average luminosity of quiescent emission ( lewin et al .",
    "the time - averaged luminosity of the bursts seen in grs  1915 + 105 is found to be from 0.15 to 4.5 times the average luminosity of the quiescent emission .",
    "the emission process involved in producing these bursts is likely to be gravitational as in the case of type ii bursts due to the energetics involved , but the large value of this ratio indicates the black hole nature of the compact object where more gravitational potential energy is available .",
    "yadav et al . ( 1999 ) have suggested that the source is in a high - soft state during the burst phase and in a low - hard state during the quiescent phase on the basis of available spectral observations and derived disk parameters of grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "the source makes state transitions in very short time scales corresponding to the rise and fall time of the bursts ( a few seconds ) .",
    "such fast changes of states are possible in the two component accretion flows ( tcaf ) where the advective disk covers the standard thin disk ( chakrabarti 1996 , rao et al .",
    "the time scales of the burst phase are compared with the viscous time scales of the thin accretion disk .",
    "recently , chakrabarti ( 1999 ) have presented a solution to the rapid state transition based on tcaf ( chakrabarti & titarchuk 1995 ) .",
    "the mass outflow from the regions of the shock compressed flow initiates the quiescent phase and the catastrophic compton cooling of the material in the sonic sphere marks the end of the quiescent phase and the start of the burst phase .",
    "this model essentially reinforces the suggestion of yadav et al .",
    "( 1999 ) but gives a physical basis for the start of the event .",
    "the shock compressed gas with compression ratio r @xmath11 1 will produce the outflows which pass through the sonic points at r@xmath12 @xmath13 r@xmath14 provided the flow is isothermal till r@xmath15 , where r@xmath14 is the shock location and @xmath16 r@xmath17/(r-1 ) ( chakrabarti 1999 ) .",
    "chakrabarti & manickam ( 2000 ) have expanded this model further and derived a correlation between t@xmath18 the duration of off state ( duration in which the sonic sphere becomes ready for catastrophic compton cooling ) and @xmath19 the qpo frequency between 2 @xmath2 10 hz . for an average shock 2.5 @xmath20 r @xmath11 3.3 , t@xmath18 is insensitive to the compression ratio .",
    "using average value of r @xmath21 2.9 and a constant velocity post - shock flow @xmath22 1 following relation is derived between t@xmath18 and @xmath19 ; @xmath23    where m is the mass of the black hole in units of the solar mass m @xmath21 10 , @xmath24 0.066 , and @xmath25 is a dimensionless parameter defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the solid angles of the inflow & outflow respectively and @xmath29 is the disk accretion rate in units of eddington accretion rate . in this configuration @xmath30 @xmath5 1 and @xmath31 0.1 keeping the total accretion rate @xmath32 close to 1 .    in figure 2 , we plot eq .",
    "1 in the log - log scale taking t@xmath18 as the quiescent time for @xmath25 @xmath21 0.0145 , 0.0245 and 0.0335 .",
    "we searched for qpo peaks in the pds by fitting frequency intervals between 0.5@xmath210 hz with gaussian profiles on top of a power - law background continuum . the width and position of the gaussian",
    "are kept as free parameters .",
    "results are plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the data of bursts with quiescent time in a narrow range are clubbed together to improve the statistics of pds analysis .",
    "the errors in qpo frequency is less than the size of the symbols .",
    "although we have used almost similar number of bursts for r1 ( a & b ) , ir and r3 bursts as used by chakrabarti & manickam ( 2000 ) , the data points are reduced in our case .",
    "we have added the r2 bursts to this analysis which have enabled us to investigate the inverse - square law dependence over a range of 25@xmath2320 s ( dotted line ) . in comparison ,",
    "chakrabarti & manickam ( 2000 ) have few points around 320 s. these results are in good agreement .",

    "2 . variation of qpo frequency @xmath19 ( minimum ) with the quiescent time for different types of x - ray bursts observed in grs  1915 + 105 ( data points ) .",
    "plotted lines are the quiescent time @xmath33 @xmath34 for different values of @xmath35 ( for further details see in text ) .    of r2 and r3 bursts",
    "when asm flux was 99.4 & 98.8 c / s respectively fall along the dotted line with @xmath36 0.0335 .",
    "the data points of r1a and ir bursts when asm flux was 59.7 and 61.5 c / s respectively fall along the dashed - dotted line ( @xmath36 0.0245 ) .",
    "the data points of r1b bursts during which asm flux has lowest value of 47.6 c / s fall along the dashed line ( @xmath36 0.0145 ) .",
    "it may be noted here that the @xmath25 and the asm flux though determined independently agree well for different types of bursts as both of these are related to the disk accretion rate @xmath29 .",
    "our results in figure 2 suggest that the t@xmath18 represents the quiescent time of all the bursts which may or may not be of the order of the viscous time scales of the thin accretion disk .",
    "however non - zero burst time would represent the viscous time scales of the thin accretion disk as any change in the @xmath29 would require the viscous time scale to reach r@xmath15 when system can revert back to the quiescent phase ( yadav et al .",
    "the ir bursts are produced due to viscous - thermal - instability and the quiescent and burst time are correlated suggesting that both these parameters represent the viscous time scales of the thin disk ( t@xmath18 is of the order of viscous time scales and changing continuously ) .",
    "the burst time varies over a large range of 100 to 500 s suggesting viscous - thermal condition are not stable during r2 bursts .",
    "the dispersion around a fixed period is large ( @xmath7 is upto 50 % ) .",
    "the burst duration of r3 bursts fall in a range of 700 to 1000 s suggesting fairly stable viscous - thermal conditions during r3 bursts .",
    "the quiescent time is fixed during r2 and r3 bursts ( @xmath5 20 & @xmath5 320 s respectively ) which represents t@xmath18 .",
    "the r1 bursts seen on 1997 may 26 and 1997 june 22 termed as `` ringing flares '' have a short burst phase of @xmath5 20 s. the peak flux during the burst phase lasts only for 1 - 2 s .",
    "the quiescent time properties of these bursts are very different from the properties observed for other types of bursts .",
    "the average quiescent flux is high ( 7000@xmath210000 c / s ) and the @xmath37 of the energy spectrum is 2.67 .",
    "the asm flux is low ( 47@xmath260 asm c / s ) .",
    "the hr@xmath38 ( ratio of flux in 5@xmath213 kev band and flux in 2@xmath25 kev band ) is high ( 1.0@xmath21.06 ) during the quiescent phase .",
    "the ratio of the average burst flux and the average quiescent flux is almost constant during these bursts ( yadav & rao 2001 ) .",
    "the dispersion around a fixed period is lowest ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this type of bursts have been observed for extended period almost continuously from 1997 may 26 to june 26 suggesting very stable thermal - viscous conditions during these burst ( yadav et al .",
    "1999 , yadav & rao 2001 ) . at t@xmath18",
    ", the sonic sphere cools down which ends the quiescent phase and marks the start of the burst phase .",
    "however the conditions are very stable and remain unchanged",
    ". the outflows immediately start and sub - keplerian halo appears quickly which abruptly ends the burst phase and the next quiescent phase starts producing ringing type burst phase with the burst peak flux hardly lasting for 1 - 2 s. the quiescent time decreases as the @xmath29 increases ( figure 2 ) . as the average quiescent flux increases the t@xmath18 decreases reducing the burst recurrence time without affecting the burst phase duration .",
    "an increase in the @xmath29 increases the quiescent flux and reduces the burst cycle ( appearing of the burst phase more frequently ) which explains why this type of bursts were observed over a large range of asm flux from 47 to 60 c / s ( the hr@xmath38 remains unchanged ) .",
