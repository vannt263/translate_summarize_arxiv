    "two - state models are often invoked to construct simple , easily analyzed transport models of otherwise overwhelmingly complex processes .",
    "examples of such processes include chromatography @xcite , isomeric conversion of proteins in solution and _ in vivo _",
    "calcium kinetics @xcite , and ratchet - driven molecular motor processes @xcite .  in such models , it is typically assumed that the species of interest , either a single entity ( dispersed in a passive solvent ) or a continuum solute concentration field composed of a dilute collection of such non - interacting species ( again dispersed in a passive solvent ) , undergo(es ) a microscale , state - specific , convective - diffusive transport process wherein the transport coefficients depend at time @xmath0 upon the `` state '' @xmath1 of the species at that time .  the rate of interchange between states is assumed to be governed by first - order kinetics .  since the total species number density does not change in time , this kinetic process is equivalent in its consequences to a reversible first - order reaction or phase transition , @xmath2 , between states @xmath3 and @xmath4 .  in almost all cases of interest , one is not generally concerned with the detailed intrastate transport of the species in state @xmath3 or @xmath4 individually , but rather only with knowledge of the long - time , asymptotic aggregate transport of the composite @xmath3-@xmath4 species ; that is , interest focuses only on the combined transport occurring in both states @xmath3 and @xmath4 for times sufficiently long such that the interstate reaction has effectively achieved global equilibrium ( although the reaction may not be in local equilibrium at each point in space ) .  remarkably , this averaged aggregate transport is diffusive , even in the absence of molecular diffusion .",
    "many two - state models only feature the explicit incorporation of convection and a  reaction , \" without explicitly accounting for intrastate molecular diffusion .",
    "consequently , it is tempting to say that these models constitute examples of  convective dispersion without molecular diffusion .",
    "\" however , the interstate transfer reaction often corresponds to a simple model for the solute s _ molecular diffusion , _ allowing it to sample two different velocity fields prevailing at different points in space , say , in two different phases . in an exactly - posed model @xcite",
    ", molecular diffusion transports the solute to the interphase boundary , whereupon an interstate mass transfer  reaction \" occurs . without the explicit incorporation of diffusion , a simplified ( or rate limited ) one - dimensional model @xcite allows the solute to  jump \" between phases in a kinetic manner .",
    "the dispersivity computed from such a  nondiffusive \" model @xcite , which possesses a mathematical structure similar to the generic problem to be considered here , does indeed furnish a convective dispersivity which is explicitly independent of the molecular diffusivity . from a physical viewpoint ,",
    "though , the convective dispersion may still be attributed to molecular diffusion , but at a finer - scale level of description than is represented by the coarse - scale transport equations adopted in our model . as such , it is not entirely correct to say that existing two - state chromatography models satisfy our claim of  convective dispersion without molecular diffusion . \"",
    "rather , our claim more closely corresponds to the case where the dispersion arising from the interstate reaction does not occur as a consequence of molecular diffusion involving solute molecules which randomly shuttle back and forth between two different velocity fields ( phases ) located at different points in space . to see how such a scenario arises ,",
    "consider the examples of molecular motors and denaturing of double - stranded dna . in the case of molecular motors",
    "@xcite , the species can exist in either a charged or uncharged state . when charged , the particle undergoes convective transport due to its interaction with a charged potential field , the latter referred to as the  track . \"",
    "during the course of its convective motion , the particle may also interact biophysically with the surrounding medium ( say , by incorporating atp ) .",
    "the latter interactions neutralize the particle and arrest its convective motion .",
    "the overall biophysical process is cyclical , so the particle may again become uncharged , enabling the transition between charged and uncharged states to be modeled as a reversible chemical reaction .",
    "though the particle itself also undergoes brownian motion , the transitions between the charged and uncharged states depend only upon the chemical interactions of the particle with the surrounding medium , not the spatial location of the particle .",
    "another example of a non - diffusive change in state involves the partial denaturing of double - stranded dna .",
    "in such circumstances , the two associated strands become locally separated over a short range of base pairs , owing to an elevated temperature ( or an equivalent concentration of denaturant ) exceeding the local melting temperature . the native - denatured transition is primarily attributed to a chemical interaction between the base pairs ( and the denaturant , if present ) , rather than to molecular diffusion .",
    "the native and denatured states possess distinctly different electrophoretic mobilities , and it is these differences which have been exploited in the context of numerous electrophoretic schemes @xcite for the detection of disease - causing mutations . inasmuch as the mutation detection relies upon interpreting the chromatographic bands , it would be useful to have a greater understanding of the role of fluctuations between the states ( which could be related to , say , fluctuations in the effective temperature of the medium ) upon the overall chromatographic process . in both the motor and denatured dna cases , the change in the solute state , and",
    "thus the solute velocity , arises from a chemical interaction with the medium , not from a conventional molecular diffusion process transporting the solute to a new point in space .",
    "consequently , the convective dispersion process arising here would persist in the absence of molecular diffusion .    as a prelude to a much more general analysis , the main point of this paper",
    "is illustrated by considering the following elementary non - diffusive system : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the conditional probability density of state @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the species velocity , @xmath9 is the interstate reaction rate , and @xmath10 is the dirac delta function .",

    "the latter property is equivalent in its consequences to a zero composite particle velocity , @xmath25 [ compare  eq .  ( [ gaussian ] ) ] .    in conventional long - time average `` macrotransport '' analyses @xcite of this type ,",
    "the dispersivity @xmath26 arises via the stochastic sampling of local velocity inhomogeneities by solute diffusion in the continuous local space .",
    "for example , in the classic case of taylor dispersion @xcite , quantifying the global solute transport occurring in a poiseuille flow within a long circular cylindrical tube , radial diffusion across the streamlines enables a solute molecule being transported axially by the poiseuille flow to sample the fluid s transversely parabolic axial velocity profile innumerable times as it moves downstream , eventually attaining a stationary mean velocity @xmath27 and dispersivity @xmath26 .",
    "in contrast , the source of the dispersion in our two - state problem resides in the interstate reaction , which allows the composite @xmath3-@xmath4 species to sample the discrete `` state space . ''  nevertheless , dispersion arising from the sampling of different state - specific velocities is completely analogous to the dispersion which arises from so - called `` local - space '' velocity inhomogeneities , e.g.  poiseuille flow , in classical macrotransport theory @xcite .",
    "the stochastic foundation of chemical reactions is well established @xcite , inasmuch as the reaction rate @xmath9 may be interpreted as reflecting the probability of a reaction occurring in the interval between times @xmath0 and @xmath28 . moreover , whereas chemical reactions are considered to constitute purely deterministic processes in the full position - momentum space ( `` local space '' ) , the process is nevertheless stochastic in the reduced space ( `` global space '' ) employed in conventional kinetic models @xcite .",
    "likewise , the comparable reduction from transport in the distinct states @xmath3 and @xmath4 to transport in the composite @xmath3-@xmath4 state results in a stochastic ( diffusive )  composite transport process .    in the present contribution , we investigate more thoroughly this surprising property of two - state systems .",
    "this is effected by computing , via the theory of macrotransport processes @xcite , the asymptotic , long - time mean velocity , @xmath27 , and dispersivity , @xmath26 , of a more general two - state system than that defined by eqs .",

    "moment - matching concepts have been used @xcite to consider systems where the different `` states '' correspond to the different physical phases ( e.g.  solid and liquid ) through which a solute molecule can be transported at different velocities .",
    "in contrast with the present analysis , the latter analyses employed molecular diffusion to transport the solute to the interface across which the interstate mass transfer ( change in state ) occurs .",
    "subsequently , iosilevskii and brenner @xcite used eigenfunction expansions of the moments to develop a general macrotransport scheme for the analysis of reactive mixtures in an incompressible solvent flow , where molecular diffusion again played an important role in enabling the solute to sample the local space .",
    "balakotaiah and chang @xcite used center - manifold techniques to examine problems in chromatography theory which are similar to those considered here , albeit with an implicit dependence upon molecular diffusion .",
    "the results of the latter correspond to a special case of the subsequent analysis , which , we believe , employs a more straightforward technique than is manifest in center manifold theory .",

    "<S> a method - of - moments scheme is invoked to compute the asymptotic , long - time mean ( or composite )  velocity and dispersivity ( effective diffusivity ) of a two - state particle undergoing one - dimensional convective - diffusive motion accompanied by a reversible linear transition ( `` chemical reaction '' or `` change in phase '' ) between these states . </S>",
    "<S> the instantaneous state - specific particle velocity is assumed to depend only upon the instantaneous state of the particle , and the transition between states is assumed to be governed by spatially - independent , first - order kinetics .  </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , even in the absence of molecular diffusion , the average transport of the `` composite ''  particle exhibits gaussian diffusive behavior in the long - time limit , owing to the effectively stochastic nature of the overall transport phenomena induced by the interstate transition . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic results obtained are compared with numerical computations .    </S>",
