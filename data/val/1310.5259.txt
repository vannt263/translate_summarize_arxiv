    "with the sustained progress of nanoscale deposition techniques such as sputtering and molecular beam epitaxy , which grant control over the deposition process at the atomic scale , thin films are playing an ever increasing role in applied science and technology  @xcite . besides the use of thin films in many applications of great technological importance such as optical coatings , electronics , packaging , and magnetic recording media , much effort has recently been focused on their investigation under a variety of experimental conditions ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , several experimental investigations have characterized the response of various nanoscale magnetic systems under spatially - varying magnetic fields .",

    "furthermore , davidenko and al - kadhimi studied the formation of magnetic gratings in epitaxial garnet films under spatially periodic magnetic fields , which were obtained by using spatially periodic fringing fields from a magnetic tape  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a number of theoretical efforts have been devoted to study the response of magnetic systems under inhomogeneous and/or oscillating magnetic fields .",
    "the interplay of characteristic time- and lengthscales between the geometrical and dynamical features of the magnetic system ( shape , size , thickness , mono- or multilayer configuration , deposition rate , etc ) and the external magnetic fields leads to a variety of complex phenomena . some of these studies , which focused on ising - like spin systems , have investigated field - driven dynamical phase transitions  @xcite , dynamical symmetry breaking of hysteresis loops  @xcite , switching and magnetization reversal  @xcite , droplets , nucleation , and metastable states  @xcite , and stochastic resonance  @xcite .    within the broad context of these recent experimental and theoretical investigations ,",
    "the aim of this work is to address the computational modeling of far - from - equilibrium thin film growth under spatially periodic magnetic fields by means of extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "the irreversible growth of magnetic thin films is investigated by using the so - called magnetic eden model ( mem )  @xcite , an extension of the classical eden model  @xcite in which particles have a two - state spin as an additional degree of freedom .",
    "the mem growth process is irreversible , since newly deposited particles are not allowed to flip and thermalize once they are added to the growing cluster .    driven by the external magnetic field , we observe the occurrence of stochastic resonance ( sr ) phenomena leading to a first - order phase transition between a dynamically symmetric phase and a dynamically asymmetric phase .",
    "this transition can be associated to the phenomenon of  spatial hysteresis \" , which is analogous to the behavior of ising - like spin systems under ( time - dependent ) oscillating magnetic fields .",
    "however , new features arise from the nature of the growth process investigated here : the roughness of the interface between neighbor magnetic domains has a characteristic scale in competition with the wavelength of the external magnetic field",
    ". therefore , depending on the interplay of characteristic lengthscales , two kinds of stochastic resonance regimes are possible , which we further describe as standard ( ssr ) and anomalous ( asr ) stochastic resonance .",
    "the characteristics of both ssr and asr regimes are extensively discussed .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the model and describe the monte carlo algorithm used to simulate thin film growth under spatially periodic magnetic fields . in section 3 , we present and discuss our results .",
    "finally , section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "in the eden model  @xcite , originally proposed as a stochastic kinetic model for the growth of bacterial colonies , particles are added at random to the perimeter of a growing cluster .",
    "the eden model is known to belong to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class  @xcite ; indeed , the most accurate simulation results for the kpz model  @xcite appear to agree well with some of the formerly reported exponents for kpz  @xcite and the eden model in @xmath4-dimensions for @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic eden model ( mem ) is an extension of the eden model in which particles have a magnetic moment coupled through ising - like interactions . in regular lattices , the mem s growth process leads to eden - like self - affine growing interfaces and fractal cluster structures in the bulk and displays a rich variety of nonequilibrium phenomena , such as thermal order - disorder continuous phase transitions , spontaneous magnetization reversals , as well as morphological , wetting , and corner - wetting transitions ( see ref .",

    "since the films are effectively semi - infinite and the substrate length along the growth direction plays no role , the only characteristic length of the setup is the transverse linear size @xmath0 .    in this work ,",
    "we study the irreversible growth of thin films under spatially periodic magnetic fields given by : @xmath17 we consider that fluctuations are controlled by a thermal bath that maintains the temperature fixed at @xmath18 . according to the mem s growth rules  @xcite",

    "the probability for a perimeter site at @xmath9 to be occupied by a spin is proportional to the boltzmann factor @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the change of energy involved in the addition of the spin .",
    "notice that the adoption of a boltzmann factor implies that , near the growing interface , not - yet - deposited spins in the spin gas reservoir are in equilibrium with the thermal bath at temperature @xmath18 ; upon attachment to the interface , however , spins become quenched .",

    "all perimeter sites have to be considered and the probabilities of adding a new ( either up or down ) spin to each site must be evaluated . using the monte carlo simulation method ,",
    "after all probabilities are computed and normalized , the growth site and the orientation of the new spin are both simultaneously determined by means of a pseudo - random number .",
    "the change of energy involved in the addition of a new spin , @xmath25 , depends on the local configuration of neighboring spins ; however , since the sum of boltzmann factors over all perimeter sites is a global ( nonconserved ) quantity , the mem s growth rules require updating the normalized deposition probabilities at each time step and lead to very slow algorithms compared with analogous equilibrium spin models .",
    "clusters having up to @xmath26 spins have typically been grown for lattice sizes up to @xmath27 .    as in the case of the classical eden model  @xcite , the magnetic eden model leads to a compact bulk and a self - affine growth interface  @xcite .",
    "the growth front may temporarily create voids within the bulk , usually not far from the rough growth interface .",
    "however , since the boundaries of these voids are also perimeter sites , they ultimately become filled at some point during the growth process .",
    "hence , far behind the active growth interface , the system is compact and frozen , and the different quantities of interest can thus be measured on defect - free transverse columns .",
    "the growth of magnetic eden aggregates in @xmath28-strip geometries is characterized by an initial transient length @xmath29 ( measured along the growth direction , i.e. the @xmath30axis ) followed by a nonequilibrium stationary state that is independent of the initial configuration  @xcite .",
    "we considered starting seeds formed by @xmath0 up spins ( i.e. @xmath31 ) but any choice for the seed leads to the same stationary states for @xmath32 . by disregarding the transient region ,",
    "all results reported in this paper are obtained under stationary conditions .",
    "while keeping the field s period fixed at @xmath33 lattice units throughout , we explore extensively the remaining parameter space by scanning meaningful ranges in temperature , magnetic field amplitude , and system size .",
    "notice that , since the transitions are due to the competition between @xmath1 and the other relevant lengthscales in the system , assuming a fixed value for @xmath1 throughout does not entail a loss of generality .",

    "the far - from - equilibrium response under spatially periodic fields can therefore be viewed as a competition between two lengthscales , namely the characteristic decay length @xmath56 versus the magnetic field s period @xmath1 . for sufficiently large field amplitudes , @xmath57 and , thus , the field is capable of switching the film s magnetization within the length of one field half - period .",

    "further discussions on finite - size effects will be presented below .",
    "for equilibrium systems , the magnetic susceptibility is related to order parameter fluctuations by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "although the validity of a fluctuation - dissipation relation in the case of nonequilibrium systems is not formally proven , earlier studies of nonequilibrium spin models  @xcite have shown that assuming an analogous definition for the susceptibility in terms of the moments of the order parameter probability distribution , namely @xmath69 is useful to investigate the nature of phase transition phenomena under far - from - equilibrium conditions .",

    "moreover , the residence - time peaks appear at regular locations that correspond to odd multiples of @xmath46 , thus indicating that resonance with the external field is indeed the mechanism responsible for driving the system across different dynamic states .",

    "thus , the stochasticity appears to operate along the ( longitudinal ) growth direction in the ssr regime , whereas it appears to operate along the transverse direction in the asr regime .",
    "in this work , we studied the irreversible growth of thin films under spatially periodic magnetic fields in @xmath112dimensional strip geometries . by analyzing snapshot configurations , we found qualitative evidence for the occurrence of pseudo - phase transitions from a dynamically ordered phase to a dynamically disordered phase , driven by the magnetic field amplitude . by analogy with ising - like models in time - dependent oscillating fields",
    ", we characterized the phenomenon of  spatial hysteresis \" and showed evidence of corresponding localization / delocalization transition of spatial hysteresis loops . by using the period - averaged magnetization as order parameter",
    ", we quantitatively described the dynamic transition .",
    "the study of binder cumulants and the susceptibility provided robust evidence of this transition being of discontinuous ( first - order ) nature .",
    "remarkably , two distinct stochastic resonance regimes are responsible for the occurrence of dynamic pseudo - phase transitions , depending on the relative width of the thin film compared to the magnetic field s wavelength . for small system sizes ,",
    "the transition is associated with a standard stochastic resonance ( ssr ) regime . instead , for large system sizes , the emergence of an additional relevant lengthscale , namely the width of the spin domain switching interface , was found to lead to a so - called anomalous stochastic resonance ( asr ) regime .",
    "we analyzed these two stochastic resonance regimes both qualitatively ( by means of snapshot configurations ) as well as quantitatively , via residence - length and order - parameter probability distributions .    in the context of a great experimental and theoretical interest in magnetic systems growing under inhomogeneous and oscillating magnetic fields , as well as a wide variety of technological applications that benefit from these efforts ,",
    "we hope that this work will contribute to the progress of this research field and stimulate further work .",
