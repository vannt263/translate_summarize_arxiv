    "polaron is a carrier in a condensed - matter system that deforms surrounding atoms or ions from their equilibrium positions . a stable polaron moves through the system together with the deformation .",
    "the deformation impedes polaron motion , increases its effective mass and reduces mobility . in polar solids with low carrier density ,",
    "the carrier - ion interaction derives from an unscreened coulomb interaction which is strong at short distances .",
    "polaron transport properties sharply , often exponentially , depend on ion positions , and are a sensitive probe of the ion subsystem . traditionally , ion motion has been controlled through global variables such as temperature or pressure , or through local modifications such as isotope substitutions .",

    "@xcite ions are driven into resonance by strong laser fields and acquire oscillation amplitudes as large as several percent of a lattice constant .",
    "@xcite such displacements significantly reduce or even completely eliminate the deformation caused by the interaction with a carrier . as a result ,",
    "the carrier is `` liberated '' from the potential trap created by the ions and its transport changes dramatically .",

    "however , there has hardly been any work on externally driven polarons or bipolarons .",
    "most theoretical treatments of polaron - light interactions are based on the linear response theory ,  @xcite and as such assume weak coupling between a charge carrier and an external electric field .",
    "the field is treated as a perturbation that does not change polaron states but only causes transitions between them . in this work ,",
    "we are interested in the opposite limit of strong coupling when the field directly alters the local state of the polaron . arguably , this is a much harder mathematical problem , and this is perhaps one reason why it has not been widely addressed before . if fact , we are not aware of any publication on this subject prior to our own recent paper .",

    "given that neither @xmath33 nor @xmath173 is known ( unless detailed first - principle calculations of the dielectric response are performed ) it is convenient to lump both interactions in one effective ion - field interaction with a new phenomenological coupling constant @xmath200 .",

    "the ability to drive ions in resonance by external laser fields is a powerful technique of experimental solid state physics . in systems",
    "where ions are strongly coupled to charge carriers or other degrees of freedom , direct excitation of ions must lead to large and measurable changes in other subsystems . in this paper , we investigated one model system where such effects are particularly strong : the small lattice polaron . by definition ,",
    "a lattice polaron is a charge carrier that interacts with surrounding ions so strongly that it deforms the lattice and displaces the ions from their equilibrium positions by finite amounts .",
    "if those ions are agitated by a different source , in our case by an external laser field , that should change the balance of forces between the ions and the carrier .",

    ", we employed direct step - by - step integration of the time - dependent schrdinger equation as the main analysis tool .",
    "a two - site polaron model has been chosen as being sufficient to reveal the essential physics .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\(i ) increase of polaron tunneling rate has been found at all ion frequencies @xmath8 ( as compared to the bare transfer integral @xmath0 ) , as long as the field is appropriately tuned to the ion resonance .",
    "the effect exists in a finite range of driving frequencies . in accordance with general polaron theory ,",
    "an optimal driving frequency has been found to be @xmath224 in the anti - adiabatic limit @xmath225 , and gradually decreasing to @xmath226 in the adiabatic limit @xmath227 .",
    "\\(ii ) resonant energy build up has been proposed as a common physical mechanism behind enhancement of tunneling . when an oscillator , quantum or classical , is driven in resonance ,",
    "its amplitude grows linearly with time . as a result ,",
    "one of the ion s turning points gets progressively closer to a symmetrical position between two stable states , symmetrizing the polaron potential and reducing its height . after a finite number of oscillations",
    "the barrier is reduced so much that the ion tunnels `` easily . ''",
    "( of course , tunneling is not instantaneous but because of exponential dependence , at a very high level one can assume that tunneling happens as soon as the barrier is reduced to a certain height . ) after tunneling , the ion initially loses energy dropping to the potential bottom .",
    "after that , the process begins in the opposite direction .",
    "\\(iii ) it follows from the above mechanism that @xmath166 scales linearly with the number of resonant oscillations , i.e. , linearly with the potential s depth . at the same time , frequency of undriven tunneling scales exponentially with the potential s depth .",
    "thus the ratio of driven to undriven @xmath166 scales _ exponentially _ with the coupling constant and as such can reach several orders of magnitude in the deep polaron regime .",
    "\\(iv ) with similar reasoning , one can predict a linear dependence of @xmath166 on the field amplitude @xmath17 .",
    "( and subsequently , a square root dependence on laser intensity , @xmath228 . ) the rate of amplitude increase is proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the number of oscillations needed to reach the `` easy tunneling '' condition is @xmath229 , from which the stated dependence follows .",
    "\\(v ) in addition to affecting ions , the external field couples directly to carriers . the field modulates carrier density on both sites , which in turn rocks the ion and drives it in resonance even in the absence of direct laser - ion interaction .",
    "the two interactions are generally of the same order but they pull the ion in opposite directions , so that the two forces partially compensate each other .",
    "let us conclude by briefly discussing possible consequences of polaron `` undressing '' .",
    "the present work was motivated by recent experiments on dynamically stabilized superconductivity .",
    "@xcite we previously proposed  @xcite that exponential enhancement of bipolaron tunneling rates between copper - oxygen bilayers could explain the observed increase of the apparent critical temperature in ybco .",
    "this proposal requires additional proof . given that the observable quantity in ref .",
    "[ ] was an optical response , it would make sense to compute the dynamical optical response of a driven ( bi)polaron . this calculation is left for future work . more generally , any polaron property that depends on the tunneling probability , for example dc conductivity or hall coefficient , will be affected by a resonant excitation of ions .",
