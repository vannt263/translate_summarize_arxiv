    "entanglement is one of the most fascinating aspects of quantum mechanics , used both for fundamental tests of physical principles and for applications such as quantum key distribution ( qkd ) .",
    "many different kinds of photonic entanglement have been produced , including entanglement in polarization @xcite , momentum @xcite , angular momentum @xcite and time - energy .",
    "investigation of the latter degree of freedom has been mainly inspired by two photon bunching experiments first carried out by ou and mandel @xcite , see @xcite ; and by franson s proposal @xcite for addressing the entanglement in the time domain , see @xcite .",
    "photons entangled simultaneously in both time - energy and other degrees of freedom have also been studied @xcite .",
    "time - energy entanglement can also be viewed as frequency entanglement , as demonstrated in recent works @xcite . here",
    "we show how to address time - energy entangled photons directly in the frequency domain .",
    "this is realized in optical fibers by using commercially available telecommunication components .    before presenting our approach",
    ", it may be useful to recall franson s proposal @xcite which is based on three key ideas .",
    "first , a continuous pump laser produces time entangled photon pairs : the emission time of each photon is uncertain , but both photons are emitted simultaneously .",
    "second , one uses measurements that resolve the arrival time of the photons .",
    "this leads to the concept of _ time bin _ : two photons whose arrival time can not be distinguished by the detectors belong to the same time bin .",
    "third , different time bins are made to interfere by using unbalanced mach - zehnder interferometers .",
    "these ideas provide a powerful platform to investigate quantum entanglement , yielding seminal works such as long distance violation of bell inequalities @xcite and entanglement based qkd @xcite .    here",
    "we also use the time - energy degree of freedom , but the way it is addressed is very different .",
    "however at the conceptual level there is an instructive parallel between our approach and that of franson .",
    "first , a narrow band pump laser produces frequency entangled photon pairs : the frequency of each photon is uncertain , but the sum of the frequencies is well defined .",
    "second , our detectors are preceded by narrow band filters that resolve the frequency of the detected photons .",
    "this leads to the concept of _ frequency bin _ : two photons whose frequency is so close that they can not be distinguished by the filters are said to lie in the same frequency bin .",
    "third , different frequency bins are made to interfere by using electro - optic phase modulators .",
    "our work is inspired by , or related to , earlier proposals for manipulating qubits in the frequency domain @xcite .",
    "our experimental techniques follow closely those of qkd systems in which the quantum information is encoded in frequency sidebands of an attenuated coherent state @xcite .",
    "such systems allow efficient transmission of quantum information at telecommunication wavelengths .",
    "the main advantage of this method for encoding and carrying out transformations on optical qubits is that one does not need to stabilize paths in optical interferometers .",
    "rather one must only lock the local radio frequency ( rf ) oscillators used by alice and bob , which is much easier .",
    "furthermore information encoded in sidebands is unaffected by birefringence in the optical fiber used for transmission .",
    "recent improvements to these experiments have included dispersion compensation and long distance synchronization of the sender and receiver @xcite , so that this approach constitutes now the only commercial alternative to time bin based qkd .",
    "the architecture reported in @xcite was dedicated to qkd using faint laser pulses , but it is inefficient when single photons are used because weak modulation amplitudes are required . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "an alternative method was proposed @xcite in which information is encoded both in the amplitude and relative phase of three frequency bands generated by electro - optic phase modulators .",
    "this second approach is attractive because in principle the phase modulators need not attenuate the signal , because there is no need for a strong reference pulse , and because the phase modulators can address many frequency sidebands simultaneously .",
    "here we transpose , with appropriate modifications , the setup of @xcite to the entangled photon case .    in the following",
    "we first describe our experiment and give the principle of our method",
    ". then we present our experimental results , and demonstrate that the phase modulators can coherently address up to eleven frequency bins .",
    "note that high dimensional entanglement has been studied in a number of earlier experiments , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we finally show that the two photon interference pattern we obtain can in principle violate a bell inequality adapted to our setup by more than five standard deviations .",
    "experimental setup .",
    "the quasi - monochromatic pump laser ( pump ) creates photon pairs in the periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide ( ppln ) and is then removed by a drop filter ( f ) .",
    "alice and bob s photons are selected passively by a @xmath1 splitter .",
    "the photons then pass through electro - optic phase modulators ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the phase modulators are driven by a @xmath3 radio frequency generator ( rf gen ) whose output is controlled by variable attenuators ( @xmath4 ) and phase shifters ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "rf isolators ( not shown ) guarantee the independence of alice and bob s settings ( @xmath6 isolation ) .",
    "individual frequency bins are selected by narrow band filters which consist of a fiber bragg grating ( @xmath7 ) preceded by a circulator ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the photons are finally detected by avalanche photo - diodes ( @xmath9 ) and the electronic signals sent to a time to digital converter ( tdc ) to perform a coincidence measurement . a typical figure recorded by the tdc , consisting of a background due to accidental coincidences and a narrow peak when the photons arrive in coincidence ,",
    "typical values for the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) ( number of non accidental coincidences divided by number of accidental coincidences ) are @xmath10 .",
    "inset ( a ) shows a typical transmission spectrum of the narrow band filters .",
    "inset ( b ) illustrates how the phase modulators generate new frequencies : if a broadband source passes through the narrow band filter ( as in ( a ) ) , and then through a phase modulator , one obtains the spectrum of ( b ) .",
    "the height of the peaks is given by the norm square of the coefficients in eq .",

    "the range of values of @xmath34 which were experimentally accessible are limited to @xmath35 due to the finite power of the rf generator used .",

    "the use of such narrow band filters together with a spectrally bright ppln source of entangled photons has been reported previously in the context of four - photon experiments @xcite .",
