    "the last decade has seen a remarkable increase in the experimental efforts to control spontaneous emission dynamics of dipole transitions by tailoring the dielectric surroundings of the source .",
    "while studies in elementary geometries , such as planar interfaces@xcite or spherical particles@xcite , remain of current interest , particular impetus in spontaneous emission control derives from solid state cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed)@xcite , and the increasing capability to shape semiconductors on the nanometer scale .",
    "of particular interest in this respect are photonic band gap materials@xcite . as first proposed by bykov@xcite and yablonovitch@xcite ,",
    "three - dimensionally periodic arrangements of dielectric material on wavelength - sized length scales allow to create a medium in which spontaneous emission processes can not only be enhanced but also completely inhibited .",
    "these photonic crystals offer many exciting prospects in fundamental physics , ranging from cqed , control of black - body radiation@xcite and the slowing and storage of light  @xcite , as well as device opportunities  @xcite for producing and processing of optical signals on sub - micron length scales .",
    "although efforts in realizing spontaneous emission control in three - dimensional ( 3d ) photonic band gap crystals have been partly successful@xcite , the advantages of easier fabrication and characterization has motivated many groups to work on lower - dimensional , i.e. , two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystal structures .",
    "photonic crystals in thin semiconductor membranes have recently shown particular promise to realize ultrasmall cavities with very high quality factors , suited for quantum optics in the strong coupling limit@xcite .",
    "in addition , the first experimental evidence@xcite for large emission inhibition of quantum dots and quantum wells in photonic crystal membranes has recently been reported .",
    "although all these results suggest that the effect of the gap in the in - plane band - structure is greatly enhanced by the vertical index contrast , a systematic study of the potential for spontaneous emission rate control offered by membrane photonic crystals is lacking .",
    "in this paper we present a theoretical study of the spontaneous emission rate modifications in membrane photonic crystals that consist of only a finite number of unit cells . such an analysis is particularly challenging for structures that are limited in size because approaches that are based on the commonly used plane - wave electromagnetic eigenfunction calculations@xcite can not be used .",
    "we have therefore used a method similar to that recently proposed by hwang et al.@xcite , xu et al.@xcite and hermann and hess@xcite , based on the three - dimensional finite difference time - domain method ( fdtd)@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ method ] we summarize our theoretical approach and discuss the numerical characteristics of the method . in section  [ comparison ]",
    "we discuss the spontaneous emission lifetime modification for a dipole in the center of a photonic crystal membrane , and compare our result to both 2d and 3d plane wave calculations of the local density of states .",
    "in section  [ polarization ] we focus on the dependence of the emission lifetime on the orientation of the transition dipole moment and the position of the emitter in the central plane of the membrane . in section  [ gapwidth ]",
    "we consider the role of the crystal size in determining the spontaneous emission rate , and propose a relation between the width of the emission gap and the number of crystal rows that need to surround the emitter to obtain maximum inhibition . in section  [ sepdep ] ,",
    "we focus on the effect of membrane thickness and of the height of the dipole above the membrane center on the emission lifetime .",
    "we show that a simple model for the emission rate in homogeneous dielectric slabs explains many of the observed features .",
    "finally , in section  [ ensemble ] we discuss the prospects for experiments involving localized ensembles of emitters with randomly distributed dipole moments .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the quantum analysis of spontaneous emission based on fermi s golden rule asserts that the spontaneous emission rate of an emitting dipole varies with its position @xmath1 and orientation @xmath2 , depending on the availability of photon modes at the source position and frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the central quantity that takes this into account is the local radiative density of states@xcite ( lrdos ) @xmath4 .",
    "the lrdos is a classical electromagnetic quantity that appears in the classical analysis of radiating antennas , where it describes the power needed to drive a point - like electric dipole oscillating at fixed current@xcite .",
    "this power is due to the work @xmath5 that the field @xmath6 radiated by the source @xmath7 does on the source itself .",
    "the rate of spontaneous emission @xmath8 in a dielectric structure , normalized to the free - space rate @xmath9 , therefore can be found by comparing the work @xmath10 done on the source in the dielectric structure to the work @xmath11 done on the same current source in vacuum .",
    "we use the three - dimensional finite different time domain method ( fdtd ) method for our calculations throughout this work .",
    "an important advantage of the finite difference time domain method@xcite over conventional methods@xcite to calculate the lrdos is that the field @xmath6 of a point source , and hence the lrdos , is readily calculated without solving for the electromagnetic eigenmode basis of the dielectric structure .",
    "furthermore , the fdtd method can even be used to calculate the lrdos for lossy systems in which eigenmode expansions are invalid . in this paper",
    "we follow the method of hermann and hess  @xcite , in which the lrdos is simulated for a wide frequency range at once via broadband temporal excitation of a dipole point source . for a pulsed source with frequency spectrum @xmath12 , the time - trace of the electric field @xmath13 at the position @xmath14 of the source",
    "can be fourier transformed to determine the lrdos in terms of its vacuum value @xmath15 : @xmath16 we have evaluated the validity and pitfalls of this numerical method by comparing the simulated spontaneous emission rate enhancement with exact analytical results for a dipole in a dielectric sphere@xcite , and for a dipole near a planar interface between two dielectrics@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : slabldos ] shows that accurate results for the emission rate modification are obtained by the fdtd method for a representative test case where a dipole is placed near a planar interface between air and silicon . by examining the lrdos obtained with pulses at different center frequencies , we have established that results consistent to within @xmath17 can be obtained in the frequency ranges where the vacuum emission power of the dipole current pulse exceeds @xmath18 of its maximum value . throughout this paper",
    "we use temporal excitation pulses with a gaussian envelope and bandwidths around 50% of the central frequency .    ) and vacuum calculated using the 3d fdtd method .",
    "the normalized frequency corresponds to the separation @xmath19 between source and interface , normalized to the vacuum emission wavelength @xmath20 . for the dipole in vacuum ( positive @xmath19 ) ,",
    "results are shown for three separations . in units of the grid discretization @xmath21",
    ", these are @xmath22 ( circles ) , @xmath23 ( diamonds ) and @xmath24 ( squares ) .",
    "the same temporal excitation pulses were used for @xmath22 and @xmath23 to span two different normalized frequency ranges @xmath25 . for the dipole in silicon ( negative @xmath19 )",
    "the results shown were obtained with a single excitation pulse and a single dipole position at @xmath26 from the interface . excellent agreement with the exact local radiative density of states modification ( solid line )",
    "is obtained .",
    "the total simulation volume was @xmath27 in size .",
    "[ fig : slabldos ] ]    agreement of the simulated lrdos with the exact lrdos not only depends on sufficient spectral overlap of the input current with the frequency range of interest , but also on the spatial discretisation . apart from the obvious requirement that the discretisation must be sufficiently fine to resolve features of the dielectric structure , the accuracy is affected by the dispersive properties of the cubic discretisation grid itself . to illustrate this point , fig .",

    "the exact lrdos of the homogeneous dielectric ( parabola in fig .",

    "in contrast , fig .  [",

    "the deviation exceeds 5% for frequencies at which the wavelength in the dielectric is shorter than @xmath30 , where @xmath21 is the spacing between adjacent discretisation grid points .",
    "the source of the discrepancy is the well - known anisotropic dispersion of the cubic grid as well as the cut - off of the grid for wave vectors in excess of @xmath31 .",

    "[ fig : griddos ] , confirms the role of the density of states of the numerical discretisation grid in spontaneous emission rate calculations .",

    "agreement to within @xmath35 are only obtained for frequencies @xmath36 , for which the wavelength in the highest index medium remains longer than @xmath37 times the discretisation grid spacing @xmath21 .",
    "deviations are due to the unphysical dispersion relation on the grid ( eq .  ( [ eq : fdtddispersion ] ) ) and the wave vector cut - off of the grid at @xmath38 , as evident from the excellent agreement of the fdtd result with the exact _ grid _ density of states per volume obtained by integrating eq .",

    "the desired sum is approximately @xmath44 times smaller than either term .",
    "even if time - stepping is continued till the fields have decayed by several orders of magnitude , zero padding introduces noise that is small compared to either term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : noise ] ) , but sizeable compared to the signal that remains after summing them .",
    "furthermore , strongly resonant features in lrdos spectra need to be handled with care .",
    "time series of field and current are typically limited to total time spans of only @xmath45 to @xmath46 optical cycles , as the 3d fdtd method is very computationally intensive . for resonances with quality factors in excess of @xmath47 ,",
    "time series are truncated before fields have fully decayed , giving rise to artifacts in the fourier transform that can fully dominate the simulated lrdos spectra . to remove such artifacts ,",

    "we have checked the validity of this approach for fdtd simulations of a single - mode high - q photonic crystal cavity  @xcite , which has a much narrower resonance in the lrdos than appears in any of the results presented below .",
    "for such a single mode system , the time series of the field can be extrapolated to obtain the true lrdos from an untruncated time series .",
    "we consider spontaneous emission rate modifications in two - dimensional photonic crystals within semiconductor membranes , as studied for the dipole - position averaged case by lee and yariv  @xcite .",

    "the comparison of plane wave calculations with the fdtd result shows that the vertical confinement offered by membranes prevents the washing out of the characteristic features of the 2d lrdos that occurs for vertically unconfined crystals : firstly the emission gap in the membrane referenced to the long wavelength lrdos at the same position in the crystal amounts to an inhibition by a factor around 30 , which is over five times stronger than the inhibition obtained if the structure is not truncated in the vertical direction .",

    "the enhancement of @xmath73 times compared to the emission rate in the long wavelength limit is in good agreement with the enhancement observed in the 2d lrdos .",

    ", vertical index confinement causes the emission rate modifications to be much stronger than in vertically unconfined 2d crystals .",

    "can be explained by considering the electric field mode profiles of the lowest few te and tm guided modes supported by the thin membrane .",

    "finally , we have also considered the role of ensemble averaging in experiments that use localized collections of emitters .",
    "a realization of such an experiment involves , for instance , a sub - wavelength ensemble of emitters@xcite attached to the end of a sharp glass tip and positioned by using scanning probe techniques , acting as a controllable local probe of the emission modification .",
    "such a sub - wavelength source averages over an isotropic random distribution of dipole orientations . despite the presence of dipole orientations that do not match the gap for te modes , we predict the first moment of the expected non - exponential times traces to show sizeable inhibition and enhancement of the mean emission rate .",
