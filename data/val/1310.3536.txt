    "however , as soon as the symmetry is broken ( @xmath86 ) , these gapless edge modes disappear though the bulk gap keeps open .",
    "nevertheless , as far as the symmetry breaking is small ( @xmath11 ) , we can use the emergence of almost gapless edge modes as a signal of the spt insulator .",

    "see fig.1(a ) .",
    "the emergence of gapless edge modes is a consequence of the reasoning that the spt  number can change its quantized value discontinuously across the edge only when the gap closes just as in the case of a genuine topological number .",
    "accordingly , no gapless edge modes would appear since there is no need of gap closing provided the spt number becomes ill - defined across the edge , that is , in vacuum .",
