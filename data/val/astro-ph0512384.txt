    "the original model of galaxy formation was monolithic collapse @xcite , where gravitational collapse of a cloud of primordial gas very early in the lifetime of the universe formed all parts of each galaxy at the same time .",
    "modern evidence rules out this model on two fronts ; the widely varying ages of different components of the galaxy provide a counter - example , and the @xmath0cdm cosmology predicts `` bottom - up '' i.e. hierarchical rather than `` top - down '' structure formation .",
    "hierarchical structure formation is a generic feature of cold dark matter ( cdm ) models .",
    "small overdensities are able to overcome the cosmological expansion and collapse first , and the resulting dark matter `` halos '' merge together to form larger halos which serve as sites of galaxy formation .",
    "this process continues until the present day , making galaxy formation an ongoing process .",
    "the nearly - scale - invariant primordial power spectrum inferred from combining wmap with large - scale structure observations provides power on all scales in the distribution of cdm .",
    "the baryons fall into the cdm potential wells after decoupling , leaving only trace evidence of their previous acoustic oscillations as a series of low - amplitude peaks in the matter power spectrum .",
    "the non - linear collapse of dark matter overdensities occurs on larger and larger scales , so the typical collapsed halo mass grows with time , but no preferred scale is introduced .",
    "@xmath0cdm therefore provides a distribution of halos where galaxies can form , with the details of the process up to baryonic physics .    despite the lack of preferred galaxy scales in the distribution of dark matter halos",
    ", baryonic physics causes galaxies to have minimum and maximum masses .",
    "the maximum mass is that of cd galaxies in cluster centers with baryonic masses @xmath8 and virial masses @xmath9 ; there are @xmath10m@xmath11 of baryons available in a rich cluster but virialization of galaxies and heating of gas to the high virial temperature prevent most of this mass from finding its way to the central galaxy . the minimum mass observed today is that of dwarf galaxies , @xmath12 , but galaxies may initially have formed as small as @xmath13 ( the baryonic jean s mass after recombination i.e. the minimum mass for which gravity overwhelmed pressure support ) . explaining the lack of observed galaxies with circular velocities below 30 km / s is a major goal ; it is suspected that feedback from supernovae explosions may have quenched star formation in such low - mass objects immediately after a single burst of star formation @xcite .    the growth of cosmological structure and collapse of dark matter halos is a feature of the matter - dominated epoch . during radiation - domination , perturbations on scales smaller than the sound horizon were unable to grow due to acoustic oscillations in the photon - baryon fluid that gave rise to the famous peaks in the cmb angular power spectrum and the lower - amplitude peaks in the matter power spectrum . now that we have entered a phase of dark energy domination",
    ", structure growth is slowing and will cease entirely as the universe enters a new phase of inflation .",
    "this cosmological `` freeze - out '' in structure formation is recent , since equality between the dark energy and matter densities occurred at @xmath14 .",
    "the slowing of structure formation occurs gradually , so the growth of cosmological structure continued nearly unabated until @xmath15 , even though we see strong observational evidence for `` downsizing '' at @xmath16 where high - mass galaxies grow far more slowly than lower - mass galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another term being used by some is `` anti - hierarchical '' , which is basically a synonym for `` downsizing '' but seems to imply inconsistency with hierarchical cosmology .",
    "however , the observed freeze - out in galaxy ( and possibly supermassive black hole ) formation in massive galaxies is not inconsistent with cdm models ; rather , it appears to be caused by baryonic feedback which is not well understood at present ( see  [ sec : problems ] ) .",
    "the slowing of cosmological structure growth since @xmath17 may , however , play a role in the recent decline of the cosmic star formation rate density discussed by @xcite .",
    "the study of galaxy formation is made easier by having full boundary conditions .",
    "the final conditions are the hubble sequence of mature galaxies we see in the nearby universe at redshift zero .",
    "indeed , much has been learned about galaxy formation from `` archaeological '' evidence in the ages and chemical abundances of various galactic stellar populations , and expanding these studies to the rest of the local group and beyond is quite useful . nonetheless , there are great advantages to observing galaxies in the act of formation , which motivates the study of high - redshift galaxies . at @xmath18 ,",
    "galaxy - mass halos are rare so the majority of galaxies we observe reside in dark matter halos that have only recently collapsed i.e. at high - redshift most galaxies are young . in this sense",
    ", @xmath18 can be considered the epoch of galaxy formation .",
    "instead of studying galaxies as discrete objects residing in dark matter halos , one can track the cosmological quantities that comprise the baryon budget .",
    "galaxy formation and evolution plays the fundamental role in the processing of baryons from neutral hydrogen to molecular gas to stars to metals .",
    "star formation is inextricably linked with galaxy formation ; whether you choose to define a galaxy as a large conglomeration of stars or an overdensity of baryons inside a collapsed dark matter halo , the galaxies in our universe form great numbers of stars .",
    "the cosmological quantities of interest provide integral constraints on star formation .",
    "the cosmic star formation rate density ( sfrd ) is an integral constraint averaged over the volume of the universe observable at a given redshift .",
    "the cosmic density of neutral gas , @xmath19 , the cosmic density of metals , @xmath20 , and the cosmic stellar mass density all provide integral constraints on the sfrd over time , as will be discussed below .",
    "the sum of the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) and cosmic far - infrared background ( firb ) radiation provides an integral constraint on the sfrd from the big bang all the way to @xmath21 by tracing the energy generated by nuclear reactions in stars .",
    "the damped lyman @xmath1 absorption systems ( dlas , @xcite ) are quasar absorption line systems with hi column densities @xmath22@xmath23 , sufficient to self - shield against the high - redshift ionizing background . studying quasar absorption - line spectra",
    "provides a ( nearly ) unbiased sample of lines - of - sight through the cosmos ideal for measuring cosmological quantities .",
    "the dlas have been found to contain the majority of neutral hydrogen atoms at high redshift ( see the recent review by * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , dlas contain the vast majority of neutral gas , by which we mean neutral hydrogen and helium in regions that are sufficiently neutral to cool and participate in star formation , as lower column density systems are predominantly ionized .",
    "hence the dlas provide the reservoir of neutral gas that is available for star formation . in a simple closed box model , @xmath24 , and the net decrease in the cosmic density of neutral gas from @xmath25 to @xmath21",
    "is assumed to have all been turned into stars ( see fig . 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in that case ,",
    "the dlas appear to have formed about half of the stars seen in galaxies today .",
    "the truth is more complicated in hierarchical cosmology , where an open box model must be used ; @xmath26 cosmological models for infall of gas from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , merging of lower column - density systems , and gas loss due to galactic winds are still quite uncertain , but the star formation rates actually measured for dlas ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* @xcite ) imply that dlas could have formed all present - day stars . unfortunately ,",
    "large uncertainties in the source and sink terms prevent us from using changes in the cosmic density of neutral gas as an integral constraint on the cosmic sfrd at the present time .",
    "the cosmic star formation rate density has now been measured out to @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the high - redshift points are taken from only the lyman break galaxies , and it is unclear how severe the resulting incompleteness is since we are not sure if all star - forming galaxy populations at these redshifts are known . the plot is traditionally shown in misleading units of m@xmath11mpc@xmath28yr@xmath6 versus redshift ; in order to integrate - by - eye , one should plot this quantity versus time , and this has the effect of greatly increasing the apparent amount of star formation at low redshifts .",
    "despite significant uncertainties in the sfrd at @xmath29 due to incompleteness and large dust corrections , it appears that most stars in the present - day universe formed at @xmath30 ( see fig .",

    "the cosmic stellar mass density provides an integral constraint on the sfrd , @xmath31 .",
    "see @xcite for a recent compilation , and niv drory s contribution to this volume for an update .",
    "note that the stellar masses of galaxies are not direct observables but are inferred from rest - frame optical ( and near - infrared ) photometry by modelling each object s star formation history using an assumed initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the cosmic metal density is really a history of cosmic metal enrichment due to star formation , @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite , see their fig .",
    "7 ) show that the cosmic metallicity traced by dlas rises gradually from a mean value of [ m / h]=-1.5 at @xmath33 to a mean value of -0.7 at @xmath34 .",
    "the range of observed dla metallicities is somewhat higher than that of halo stars but overlaps , and is somewhat lower than that of thick disk stars and far lower than the near - solar values seen for thin disk stars in the milky way .",
    "the dlas uniformly show greater metal enrichment than the lyman @xmath1 forest but less than values inferred for lyman break galaxies or quasars at the same epoch ( see figs .",
    "8 , 32 of * ? ?",
    "* and see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the values given above are the cosmic mean metallicity of the neutral gas traced by dlas , but they do not represent a full census of metals , which can also be found in heavily star - forming regions that have already used up their neutral gas or can be expelled by galactic winds into the igm , which is predominantly ionized .",
    "it is therefore useful to compare the observed dla metallicities with those expected from the dla star formation rates ; this leads to a factor of ten deficit in the observed metallicities called the `` missing metals problem '' @xcite .",
    "the most likely explanation is that the star - forming regions of the galaxies seen as dlas have superwinds sufficiently strong to move most of the metals produced into the igm .",
    "theoretical efforts to understand and model galaxy formation are mostly beyond the analytical realm , where they divide into semi - analytic models and cosmological simulations .",
    "these two approaches have been converging in recent years , as the practitioners of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations are using more detailed `` recipes '' for star formation , supernova feedback , and winds and in some cases have claimed grandiose results from purely n - body simulations with many semi - analytic recipes added ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for examples of state - of - the - art cosmological",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of high - redshift galaxies and agn , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "semi - analytic models reproduce observations moderately well but have yet to demonstrate much success in predicting future observations , making them more of a tool for interpreting results than theoretical models in the classic sense .",
    "@xcite tuned their models to reproduce galaxy properties at @xmath21 and found one of their models to be in good agreement with the dust - corrected points at @xmath18 in the cosmic sfrd diagram .",
    "however , as mentioned above , semi - analytic models for infall , merging , and winds are highly uncertain and it is not clear if observations of the cosmic density of neutral gas and the missing metals problem are consistent with the predictions .",
    "similar scatter is seen in theoretical predictions of the cosmic stellar mass density .",
    "dlas dominate the neutral gas , making dla - based studies appropriate for determining its cosmic density .",
    "however , other cosmological quantities should be summed over all high - redshift objects rather than just dlas or just lyman break galaxies , which trace the bright end of the high - redshift rest - uv galaxy luminosity function .",
    "another motivation for studying all types of objects is the search for the progenitors of typical spiral galaxies like the milky way , which have not yet been pinpointed amongst the zoo of high - redshift galaxies . in designing the multiwavelength survey by yale - chile ( musyc , @xcite , http://www.astro.yale.edu/musyc ) ,",
    "it was decided to focus on selecting all known populations of galaxies at @xmath35 , where most objects are young and several selection techniques overlap ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "the various populations at this epoch are labelled by three - letter acronyms ( tlas ) .",
    "we discuss each below .",
    "the lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) are selected via the lyman break at 912  in the rest - frame .",
    "higher - energy photons are unable to escape the galaxies or travel far in the igm due to the large cross - section for absorption of ionizing photons by neutral hydrogen ( for an illustration of the technique first successfully applied by @xcite , see fig .",
    "19 of * ? ? ?",
    "at @xmath36 , the lyman break generates a very red color in @xmath37 , which could also be observed for an intrinsically red object such as an m dwarf or elliptical galaxy , leading to the additional requirement of a blue continuum color in e.g. @xmath38 , consistent with the expected starburst nature of young galaxies .",
