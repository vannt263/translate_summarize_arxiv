    ". their definition will be recalled and discussed below . equation ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "finds important applications in distinct physical and mathematical contexts , with the most prominent being that of nonlinear optics .",
    "indeed , such models have been used to describe ultrashort pulse propagation in nonlinear optical fibers in the framework of the slowly - varying envelope approximation @xcite ( see also reviews  @xcite and references therein for recent work in few - cycle pulse propagation ) . in such a case , @xmath14 and @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) play , respectively , the role of the propagation distance along the optical fiber and the retarded time ( in a reference frame moving with the group velocity ) , while @xmath4 accounts for the ( complex ) electric field envelope .",
    "the propagation of optical pulses ( of temporal width comparable to the wavelength ) is accompanied by effects , such as higher - order ( and , in particular , third - order ) linear dispersion ( characterized by the coefficient @xmath16 ) , as well as nonlinear dispersion ( characterized by the coefficient @xmath17 ) .",
    "the latter is known as `` self - steepening '' term , due to its effect on the pulse envelope .",
    "these conservative higher - order terms ( including the one of strength @xmath18 ) are naturally important not only in optics , but also in the contexts of nonlinear metamaterials @xcite and water waves @xcite .",
    "all the above effects , which are not incorporated in the standard nls equation ( @xmath19 ) , become important in the physically relevant case of ultrashort pulses .    on the other hand , and in the same nonlinear optics context , for relatively long propagation distances , dissipative effects , such as linear loss ( @xmath20 ) [ or gain ( @xmath21 ) ] , as well as stimulated raman scattering ( of strength @xmath22 ) , are also included @xcite . at the same time",
    ", it is also relevant to include the nonlinear gain ( @xmath23 ) [ or loss ( @xmath24 ) ] to counterbalance the effects from the linear loss / gain mechanisms @xcite . for relevant physical settings ,",
    "the role of such terms is to contribute to the possible stabilization of solitons .",
    "notice that such solutions exist in the standard nls equation , which possesses solitons of two different types : bright solitons ( for @xmath25 ) that decay to zero at infinity , and dark solitons ( for @xmath26 ) that have the form of density dips on top of a continuous - wave ( cw ) background accompanied by a phase jump at the density minimum .",
    "below we focus on the latter case of normal dispersion ( @xmath26 ) , for which the linear / nonlinear dissipative effects usually lead to the decay of the cw background ; this way , the composite object , composed by the background and the soliton , is destroyed .",
    "dark solitons were first predicted to occur as early as in the early 70 s @xcite , and since then have been studied extensively , both in theory and in experiments , mainly in nonlinear optics @xcite and bose  einstein condensation @xcite . concerning the higher - order nls ( [ eq1 ] ) , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown , via a newly developed perturbation theory @xcite , that dark and grey solitons can exist and feature a stable evolution at least for certain parameter regimes and time intervals , within the validity of the perturbation theory . however , their long - time dynamics are under question . the results of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that these dynamics , and different scenarios corresponding to various parameter regimes , can be very rich .",
    "the structure of the presentation and main findings of the present work are as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secii ] , we explore the finite - time collapse for the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq1])([eq3 ] ) .",
    "our analysis is motivated from the results and questions posed on the dynamics of the soliton background discussed in ref .",
    "the discussion therein , shows that there can be a finite - time for which the background exhibits blow - up .",
    "also in section [ seciia ] , based on energy arguments carried out on a spatially averaged @xmath27-energy functional , we identify that the collapse behavior of the considered @xmath27-functional is chiefly characterized by the gain / loss parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "regimes of collapse and decay of solutions are defined by @xmath28 and @xmath29 . however , for @xmath30 , we obtain the existence of a critical value on the linear gain .",
    "this critical value , say @xmath31 , is separating finite - time collapse from the decay of solutions .",
    "an important conclusion regarding the regimes @xmath28 and @xmath29 is related to the fate of localized solutions , with an initial profile resembling that of bright and dark solitons : referring to their long - time stability , such wave forms are unstable , and they may survive only for relevant short times .",
    "the above picture on the asymptotic behavior is verified completely by the results of the numerical simulations presented in section [ seciib ] .",
    "we examine the evolution for three distinct types of initial conditions , including decaying and non - decaying data . in the case of cw initial conditions , we observe that the analytical upper bound is not only fulfilled , but also saturated by the analytical blow - up times . furthermore , the numerical collapse time is independent of the strengths of the rest of the dissipative / conservative higher - order terms .",
    "the observed saturation is completely justified by the fact that the timescales for collapse of the background , and the analytical upper bound for the collapse of the @xmath27 functional , coincide in the case of the cw initial condition .",
    "also , the evolution of the @xmath27-functional is proved to be that of the cw - background .",
    "concerning the critical value @xmath31 , it is verified numerically that its analytical estimation is very accurate ; for @xmath32 the solution decays and for @xmath33 the solution blows - up in finite - time . in the case of the decaying initial data ( which are taken in the form of a @xmath34 function  as reminiscent of a bright soliton of the focusing nls ) , we have observed very interesting transient dynamics prior to collapse when @xmath35 , or decay when @xmath32 , characterized by a self - similar evolution of the initial pulse for small values of the parameters . as before , the analytical upper bound for the blow - up time is in agreement with the numerical one .",
    "however , it is not saturated since the evolution of the @xmath27 functional is dominated by the evolution of the amplitude of the localized solution .",
    "we have also tested numerically the behavior of the blow - up time with respect to large variations of the strengths of linear and nonlinear parameters @xmath16 and @xmath7 , and found the following decreasing step function effect : the numerical blow - up time jumps to a smaller numerical value but remains constant within specific regimes of variation for the increasing parameters .",
    "the jump is associated with a transition to a different type of transient dynamics prior to collapse or decay .",
    "the numerical results were also found to be in excellent agreement with the analytical ones in the case of the non - decaying initial data taken here in the form of a @xmath36 function , which resembles the intensity profile of a dark soliton of the defocusing nls , and is compliant with the periodic boundary conditions ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the numerical blow - up time is in agreement with and is also found to almost saturate to its analytical upper bound , as in the case of the cw - initial condition , at least for small variations of the parameters , for reasons that will be discussed later in the text . in regimes of larger parameter values ,",
    "we observe again the decreasing step function effect for the numerical blow - up time associated with a drastic change in the transient dynamics . in the case",
    "@xmath30 , it appears that the condition @xmath37 is not sufficient to define a stabilization regime with nontrivial dynamics or avoiding collapse .",
    "it will be shown in a subsequent work @xcite , that such a stabilization regime associated with emergent dynamics different from collapse or decay , may be defined only when @xmath21 , @xmath24 .",
    "the question of collapse concerns sufficiently smooth ( weak ) solutions of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the existence of such solutions , is guaranteed by the following local existence result associated with the initial - boundary value problem ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) .",
    "the methods which are used in order to prove such local existence result in the sobolev spaces of periodic functions @xmath38 @xcite , are based on the lines of approach of @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the application of these methods to the problem ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) , although involving lengthy computations , is now considered as standard .",
    "thus , we refrain from showing the details here , and we just state it in :    [ thmloc ] let @xmath39 for any integer @xmath40 , and @xmath41 then there exists @xmath3 , such that the problem ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) , has a unique solution @xmath42 , h^k_{per}(\\omega ) ) \\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad u_t\\in      c([0,t ] , h^{k-3}_{per}(\\omega)).\\ ] ] moreover , the solution @xmath43 depends continuously on the initial data @xmath39 , i.e. , the solution operator @xmath44,\\\\      u_0&\\mapsto&\\mathcal{s}(t)u_0=u,\\nonumber      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is continuous .    here ,",
    "@xmath45 denote the sobolev spaces of @xmath46- periodic functions on the fundamental interval @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "let us recall for the shake of completeness their definition : @xmath48 since our analytical energy arguments for examining collapse require sufficiently smoothness of local - in - time solutions , we shall implement theorem  [ thmloc ] by assuming that @xmath49 , at least . as it follows from the definition of the sobolev spaces ( [ defsob ] ) , this assumption means that the initial condition @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and its spatial ( weak ) derivatives , at least up to the 2nd - order , are @xmath46-periodic .",
    "then , it turns out from theorem  [ thmloc ] , that the unique , local - in - time solution @xmath4 of ( [ eq1 ] ) satisfies the periodic boundary conditions ( [ eq2 ] ) for @xmath52 , and is sufficiently ( weakly ) smooth .",
    "such periodicity and smoothness properties of the local - in - time solutions are sufficient for our purposes ( see theorem  [ t1a ] and appendix a , below ) .",
    "next , we adopt the method of deriving a differential inequality for the functional @xmath53 and then , showing that its solution diverges in finite - time under appropriate assumptions on its initial value at time @xmath54 ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "note that the choice of this functional is not arbitrary ; in fact , it is a direct consequence of the conservation laws of the nls model ( see appendix a ) . for a discrete counterpart of this argument applied in discrete ginzburg - landau - type equations , we refer to @xcite . for applications of these types of arguments in the study of escape dynamics for klein - gordon chains ,",
