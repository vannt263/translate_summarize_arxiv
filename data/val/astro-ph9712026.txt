    "radio observations during its 1994 outburst revealed jets moving at relativistic ( apparently superluminal ) speeds ( tingay et al .",
    "@xcite , hjellming &  rupen @xcite ) .",
    "dynamical measurements suggest that the compact star in groj1655@xmath040 is a black hole , with a mass of @xmath17m@xmath2 , while the companion star has a mass of @xmath12m@xmath2 ; its orbital period is 2.62  days and its inclination is @xmath170@xmath3 ( orosz &  bailyn @xcite , van der hooft et al .",

    "@xcite , and references therein ) . during",
    "the majority of these dips the x - ray spectra harden , which is indicative of photo - electric absorption of radiation from the central x - ray source .",
    "however , a simple neutral and uniform medium which absorbs the emission does not fit the x - ray spectra .",
    "instead , the spectra reveal an excess flux at low energies ( typically @xmath44kev ) compared to that expected from the amount of absorption estimated from data above @xmath14kev .",
    "in this contribution we report on such dips in the x - ray light curves of groj1655@xmath040 seen with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) during its 1996/1997 outburst . a full report can be found in kuulkers et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the first public rxte target of opportunity observations of groj1655@xmath040 were performed on 1997 february 26 19:3423:30  utc ( @xmath1jd2450506 ) .",
    "the _ proportional counter array _ ( pca ) data were collected with a time resolution of 16s ( 129 photon energy channels , covering 2.060kev ) and 125@xmath5s ( 3 energy channels , covering 2.05.08.713.0kev ) .",
    "the 2.013.0kev count rate of groj1655@xmath040 was generally @xmath111500ctss@xmath6 .",
    "however , 2 sharp deep drops down to @xmath11000ctss@xmath6 lasting @xmath15060s , preceded and followed by short dips , occurred ( fig .  1 , upper panel ) .",
    "the fall time scales of the main dips were 24s , while the rise time scales were 35s .",
    "the _ all sky monitor _",
    "( asm ) onboard rxte scans the sky in series of 90s dwells in three energy bands , 1.53 , 35 , and 512kev .",
    "due to satellite motion and a @xmath140%  duty cycle , any given source is scanned 510 times per day . in fig .",
    "2 we show the 1996/1997 outburst light curve ( 2 - 12kev ) provided by the rxte asm team , covering the period from 1996 february 21 to 1997 october 3 . twelve clear drops in the intensity can be seen down by @xmath12595% , which are indicated by arrows . during these dips the spectral hardness increases ( fig .  1 , lower left panel ) .",
    "the occurrences of the asm and pca dips are best fit with a period of 2.6213@xmath70.0005 days ( 1@xmath8 ) .",
    "recently , we became aware of more dips observed by the pca ( @xmath1jd2450488 ; r.  remillard , 1997 , private communication ) and the rosat hri ( @xmath1jd2450520 ; kuulkers et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; the dips observed by the pca and the rosat hri are also indicated in fig .  2 .",
    "all the observed dips occurred between photometric orbital phases ( orosz &  bailyn @xcite , van der hooft et al.@xcite ) 0.72 and 0.86 .",
    "as an example , in fig .",
    "3 we show a small part of the asm data during which dips could be seen in every orbital cycle , folded on the orbital ephemeris ( orosz &  bailyn @xcite , van der hooft et al.@xcite ) .      the pca hardness curve ( fig .  1 , lower left panel ) and corresponding hardness vs.  intensity diagram ( hid , fig .  1 , lower right panel ) show that as the intensity drops the x - ray spectrum becomes much harder , until a certain threshold count rate of @xmath12000ctss@xmath6 is reached . during the last part of the fall the spectrum softens again to almost the same value as the out - of - dip level .",
    "the reverse behaviour is seen during the rise of the dips . in the hid",
    "the source always follows the same loop , also during the small pre- and after - dips and during the short spike in the second dip .",
    "the spectral hardening between the out - of - dip count rate and the threshold value suggests that absorption is involved in the process giving rise to the dips .",
    "we fitted both the out - of - dip ( persistent ) and the dips energy spectra .",
    "for the fits to the out - of - dip spectrum we used the model usually employed for black - hole candidates , i.e. , a disk - black body ( dbb ) plus a power law .",
    "this resulted in : n@xmath9@xmath10 , for dbb parameters t@xmath11 and r@xmath11 @xmath12kev and @xmath13 km , respectively , and the power - law parameters @xmath14 and normalization a@xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17@xmath10s@xmath6kev@xmath6 , respectively ( reduced @xmath18 of 1.6 for 54 degrees of freedom [ dof ] ) .",
    "the out - of - dip x - ray flux ( 230kev ) was @xmath12.5@xmath1910@xmath20erg@xmath10s@xmath6 .",
    "this shows that the spectrum was soft .",
    "the dip spectra were not well fitted by homogeneous absorption of the out - of - dip dbb and power - law components by cold material , especially at low energies .",
    "the observed flux below @xmath16kev is much in excess from that expected in this model .",
    "we performed simple fits to the spectra by modelling this ` low energy excess ' either as a separate component ( power law or black body ) , or by partial covering absorption of the persistent components ( e.g.  marshall et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in all the dip",
    "spectral fits the persistent power - law component was found to be absent .",
    "the low - energy excess contributes only 67%  of the out - of - dip flux .",
    "depending on the model we found that the absorption of the dbb component increased up to @xmath125200@xmath1910@xmath21 at the lowest mean dip intensities , see kuulkers et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .    to see if we can qualitatively reproduce the observed shapes of the hid , we calculated several sequences of x - ray spectra and determined intensity and hardness values .",
    "the out - of - dip spectrum was modeled by the persistent dbb component ( only subject to interstellar absorption ) as given above , plus the low - energy excess contribution modeled by a black body ( see kuulkers et al.(@xcite ) . in the dip we linearly increased the absorption of the persistent dbb component from zero up to 150@xmath1910@xmath21@xmath10 , fixing the rest of the parameters to those given by the out - of - dip spectrum .",
    "the results are plotted as a line in the lower right panel of fig .  1 , and show that a gradual increase in absorption of the dbb component can reproduce the observed dip behaviour .",
    "in order to investigate the state of the source ( see e.g.  van der klis @xcite ) we computed power density spectra ( pds ) for 256s data stretches for the out - of - dip light curves .",
    "the mean pds is shown in fig .  4 , and is well fitted with a single power law ( reduced @xmath18 of 202 for 186 dof ) .",
    "the mean fractional rms variations ( 0.011hz , 213kev ) and power - law index are 2.80@xmath70.06%  and 0.98@xmath70.01 , respectively .",
    "we found no energy dependence of the pds shapes .",
    "we also computed pds during the dips ; then we used data stretches of 16s .",
    "no clear noise component could be seen in the power spectra during the dip , with a 2@xmath8 upper limit of 4.6%  and 3.6%  ( 0.01100hz , 213kev ) , assuming a power - law shaped noise component with index 1 .",
    "the properties of the out - of - dip pds and the strong soft dbb component together with a steep power law in the x - ray energy spectra indicate that when the dips occurred groj1655@xmath044 was in the so - called high state .",
    "we have discovered short - term ( @xmath1minutes ) x - ray deep dipping behaviour of groj1655@xmath040 in rxte pca and asm data .",
    "the best fit period of the occurrence of these dips is consistent with the optical period of the system ( 2.62168@xmath70.00014  days ; van der hooft et al.@xcite ; see also orosz &  bailyn @xcite ) .",
    "this therefore constitutes the first evidence of the orbital period in groj1655@xmath040 in x - rays .",
    "all these dips occurred between photometric orbital phases 0.72 and 0.86 .",
    "the phasing of the occurrence of the x - ray dips is very similar to that observed in the low - mass x - ray binary dip sources ( e.g. , parmar &  white @xcite ) .",
    "the inclination of such sources which show only dips and no eclipses are in the range 6075@xmath3 ( e.g. , frank et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "the inclination inferred for groj1655@xmath040 ( @xmath170@xmath3 , orosz &   bailyn @xcite , van der hooft et al .",
    "@xcite ) is in agreement with this .",
    "this suggests a similar origin for the cause of the dips in groj1655@xmath040 and the low - mass x - ray binary dip sources .",
    "interaction of the inflowing gas stream from the secondary with the outer edge of the disk may cause a thickening of the outer edge and/or material above or below the disk in the expected 0.60.0 phase range ( e.g. , parmar &  white @xcite ) and may well cause the observed dipping behaviour . since the dip durations",
    "are rather short compared to the orbital period , we expect that the dips in groj1655@xmath040 are caused by filaments of matter above or below the disk originating from the stream - disk impact region .      for groj1655@xmath040 the system parameters have been well determined ( orosz &  bailyn @xcite , van der hooft et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this system",
    "the time scales of the dips imposes constraints on the sizes of the different emitting and absorbing media . the fall and rise time ( @xmath22@xmath13.5s )",
    "constrain the size of the region which is `` obscured '' ; in fact , this gives an upper limit on the size , because the region over which the column density increases significantly also has a finite width ( leahy , yoshida , &  matsuoka @xcite ) .",
    "the duration of the dips ( @xmath23@xmath155sec ) constrains the size of the absorbing medium itself .    since @xmath22@xmath24@xmath23",
    ", we may assume that the absorbed x - ray source is much smaller than the absorbing medium .",
    "a medium which crosses a point - like central x - ray source may produce irregular x - ray dips , whereas crossing an extended region such as an accretion disk corona may produce smooth and longer energy independent modulations ( e.g. , parmar &  white @xcite ) . if the medium corotates in the binary frame and is located at a radius which is smaller than the outer disk radius ( @xmath25@xmath10.85r@xmath26 [ orosz &  bailyn @xcite ] , where r@xmath26 is the effective roche lobe radius of the black hole ) the upper limit on the size of the x - ray emitting region is @xmath1460 km .",
    "if the medium corotates with matter in the accretion disk ( i.e. , with a kepler velocity ) , the upper limit becomes @xmath12000 km .",
    "similar reasoning gives an approximate upper limit on the size of the absorbing medium of @xmath17200 km or @xmath132000 km , in the case of rotation within the binary frame or corotation in the accretion disk .",
    "we note that the partial covering absorption model to fit the spectra during the dips may impose physical problems .",
    "in such a model the absorbing medium consists of blobs of material and an individual blob only partially covers the central x - ray source .",
    "this means that the individual blobs must be substantially smaller than the inferred size of the x - ray emitting region .",
    "since the size of the absorbing medium is considerably ( 1570 times ) larger than the x - ray emitting region there must be many of such blobs in the absorbing medium",
    ". then one would expect many of them along the line of sight , and that they wouldd average out to a more or less uniform density medium , unless the radial extent of the absorbing medium is much smaller than the azimuthal extent .",
    "recently , a dip in the light curve of 4u1630@xmath047 during its 1996 outburst has been found in rxte pca data ( kuulkers et al .",
    "@xcite ; tomsick et al .",
    "kuulkers et al .",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) pointed out similarities in the x - ray behaviour between 4u1630@xmath047 and groj1655@xmath040 , and postulated that they are similar systems .",
    "the nature of the compact star in 4u1630@xmath047 , however , is unknown .",
    "its x - ray spectral ( e.g.  barret et al .",
    "@xcite ) and x - ray timing ( kuulkers et al .",
    "@xcite ) properties during outburst suggest it is a black - hole .",
    "the dip spectral behaviour of 4u1630@xmath047 is similar to that seen in groj1655@xmath040 ; it was therefore proposed that 4u1630@xmath047 is also seen at a relatively high inclination , i.e.  6075@xmath3 ( kuulkers et al .",
    "we note that the ` dipping ' behaviour seen in the other galactic superluminal jet source , grs1915 + 105 , is much more complex than in groj1655@xmath040 and 4u1630@xmath047 .",
    "this dipping behaviour has been proposed to be due to thermal - viscous instabilities in the inner disk ( belloni et al .",
    "@xcite ) and is therefore not due to absorption events .",
