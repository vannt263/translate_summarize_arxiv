    "the process by which compact massive astronomical objects capture the ambient matter present in the interstellar medium , and leads to increase in their mass ( and possibly their angular momentum also ) is called _ accretion _",
    "it is one of the most ubiquitous processes in the astrophysics .",
    "this accretion of gas by compact objects is likely to be the source of energy of observed x - rays binary , quasar and active galactic nuclei . during accretion , kinetic energy of in - falling gas increase on the essence of gravitational energy and",
    "subsequently result in the increase in radiant energy of the object .",
    "the history of research on the accretion of an ideal fluid onto a compact object begins with the work of hoyle and lyttleton  @xcite , who studied the effects of accretion onto the change in terrestrial climate and subsequently , the considerable change in the radiation emitted . in their work",
    ", they neglect the pressure effects .",
    "later in this extension , bondi @xcite in his pioneering work studied the stationary , spherically symmetric accretion of non - relativistic gas onto compact objects , this work was also the generalization of bondi and hoyle earlier work @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that the bondi s work was distinct from hoyle and lyttleton s @xcite works in the sense that accreting gas was at rest at infinity in the former case , while it has finite velocity in the later case .",
    "so far entire work was done using newtonian gravity .",
    "a relativistic generalization was made by michel @xcite ( see also @xcite for further generalizations and supplements to michel s solution ) who studied the stationary , spherically symmetric and relativistic accretion onto the compact objects .",
    "several generalization to michel s work have been suggested to discuss accretion in various other form @xcite , viz .",
    ", properties of the accretion onto schwarzschild black hole has been broadly investigated in @xcite and begelman @xcite examined some aspects of critical points of accretion problem .",
    "other include the accretion onto a higher dimensional black hole @xcite , onto a black hole in the string cloud background in @xcite , onto a charged black hole @xcite and onto a rotating black hole @xcite ( see all review @xcite ) .",
    "a study of general relativistic spherical accretion with and without back - reaction has also been done in @xcite and the result showed that the mass accretion rate is enhanced in the absence of back - reaction .",
    "the aim of this work is to explicitly bring out the nc geometrical effects on the spherically symmetric accretion onto schwarzschild black holes .",
    "it is well known that the accretion process is a powerful indicator of the physical nature of the central celestial objects , which means that the analysis of the accretion around the nonrotating nc inspired black hole could help us to understand the regime where general relativity breaks down .",
    "however , even after intensive research on black holes some aspects still require cogent interpretation , such as an inadequate description of the late stage black hole evaporation @xcite . still , we can explain black hole evaporation as a semiclassical process , but the breakdown happens in the limit @xmath4 during evaporation . and",
    "furthermore , the black hole temperature ( @xmath5 ) diverges in the last stage of the evaporation process , that is @xmath6 as @xmath7 .",
    "however , one can expect that this divergence will not occur actually , because in the planck phase the black hole will be dramatically disturbed by the strong quantum gravitational effects under @xmath8 . to efficiently describe all evaporation phases of black hole one",
    "must include the quantum field theory ( qft ) effects in curved space - time and ensure the controlled behavior of theory at very high energies @xcite .",
    "the noncommutativity ( ncy ) is one of the promising ways to approach qft in curved space - time @xcite , which arises naturally in the string theories @xcite .",
    "since it had been widely accepted that quantum gravity must have an uncertainty principle which prevents the exact position measurement below the planck scale .",
    "the nc geometry is naturally encoded in the commutator = i^,=0 , where @xmath9 is an anti - symmetric real matrix which determines a discretization of the spacetime .",
    "this commutator leads toward the resulting uncertainty relation in quantum gravity regime . x^x^|^| .",
    "therefore , nc geometry provides a subtle way to space - time quantization and it remove the short - distance divergences of theory as one of the most promising feature .    it may be noted that study of nc geometry inspired black hole are very important as it cures usual problem encountered in the terminal phase of the classical black hole evaporation .",
    "further , the nc inspired black hole has no curvature singularity rather it has de sitter core at short distance .",
    "many authors have extended classical black hole solution to find exact nc inspired black holes @xcite . in this paper , we study the effect of nc geometry upon spherically symmetric accretion onto nc geometry inspired schwarzschild black hole .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that the mass accretion rate @xmath0 surprisingly decrease in comparison to the schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",

    "[ eqn ] , the analytic relativistic accretion onto a nc inspired schwarzschild black hole model is appropriately developed .",
    "we calculate how the presence of a smeared mass object instead of point mass object would affect the mass accretion rate @xmath0 of a gas onto a black hole .",
    "we also determine analytic corrections to the critical radius , the critical fluid velocity and to the sound speed .",
    "we then obtain expressions for the asymptotic behavior of the fluid density and the temperature near the event horizon in sec .",
    "finally we conclude in sec.[conclusion ] .",
    "we use the following values for the physical constants for numerical computations and plots : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the analytic relativistic accretion solution onto the black hole by michel @xcite is generalized by considering a nc inspired schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we begin with a brief review of nc inspired schwarzschild black hole and its properties ( see @xcite for further details ) . in the high energy physics ,",
    "the interest about ncy become very important when , in the theory of open strings @xcite , the space - time coordinates become non commuting operators .",
    "nc geometry is currently employed to implement the fuzziness of space - time by replacing the position dirac s delta function by spatially spreading gaussian distribution @xcite .",
