    "there are two kinds of quantum statistics in nature .",
    "all particles have either half - integral or integral spin ( in units of the plank constant @xmath0 ) and they obey fermi - dirac@xcite or boson - einstein@xcite statistics respectively .",
    "it is also noted@xcite that there is an effective attraction between the bosons and an effective repulsion between the fermions .",
    "this is the well known statistical correlation effects@xcite , which are purely quantum effect .",
    "the experiments examining the quantum statistical properties date back to the pioneer work , by hanbury brown and twiss ( hbt)@xcite .",
    "they used photon intensity interferometry to probe the intensity correlation information between two partial beams , which was generated by a beam splitter . due to the bosonic property of photon ,",
    "the positive intensity correlation was observed , indicating an enhanced probability for the simultaneous detection of two photons , one in each partial beam .",
    "this means that photons tend to bunch in cluster .",
    "several theoretical works have suggested the different analogies of this experiment with electrons in mesoscopic systems . the fermionic analog of hbt experiments , one by henny et al.@xcite and the other by oliver et al.@xcite , showed the expected negative intensity correlation and observed the anti - bunching effect . in this paper we will investigate the hbt experiment for the composite boson .",
    "this composite boson is formed by a spin singlet entangled electron pair , which will be discussed below . due to the zero total spin for the entangled electron pair",
    ", we expect that these composite bosons tend to bunch in cluster .",
    "motivated by the application in quantum communication and computation , burkard et al@xcite have studied entangled electrons in an interacting many - body environment .",
    "they found that the fano factor for singlets is twice as large as for independent classical particles and is reduced to zero for triplets .",
    "torris and martin@xcite investigated a three - terminal n - n - s mesoscopic system , both positive and negative correlations were found in the andreev regime .",
    "very recently , samueisson and bttiker@xcite studied the same structure and found the positive correlation for a wide range of junction parameters which survives even in the absence of the proximity effect .",
    "the statistics of charge transport of a three terminal n - n - s beam splitter has also been investigated@xcite and positive cross correlation is found between the currents in two normal leads for a wide parameter range . instead of the structures of the references ,",
    "here we consider a three - terminal mesoscopic n - s - s hybrid system .",
    "this structure is a direct photon analogy of the hbt interferometer which has a normal lead and two superconducting leads .",
    "a quantum dot , connected by these three terminals , acts as a splitter .",
    "suppose that the chemical potentials @xmath1 for both superconducting reservoirs are set to zero , and the chemical potential for the normal is above zero , i.e. , @xmath2 , which guarantees the electron current passing from the normal lead to both superconducting leads .",
    "we further assume the temperature is very low .",
    "if the external voltage @xmath3 is smaller than the gap energy @xmath4 of the superconducting leads , the single quasiparticle current is forbidden . in this case",
    ", we only have two - electron current due to the presence of andreev reflection process , i.e. , incoming electrons being andreev reflected into outgoing holes with the transfer of a cooper pair into the superconductor .",
    "this means that an electron ( with energy @xmath5 above the fermi level and spin @xmath6 ) in the normal lead , has to combine another electron ( with energy @xmath7 , below the fermi level and spin @xmath8 ) to pass through the ns interface .",
    "does this entangled electron pair@xcite look like a composite boson ? or rather ,",
    "can we obtain a positive cross correlation function ( @xmath9 with @xmath10 ) between two superconducting leads ?",
    "the purpose of this paper is to answer this question .",
    "we note that due to the current conservation the cross correlation function of a two - lead system must be negative regardless of normal or superconducting leads . instead of considering the fluctuation in a single electron beam through the two - lead system ,",
    "the hbt experiment considered here focuses on the cross correlation of two beams from the beam splitter .",
    "hence we expect positive cross correlation at small voltages which is indeed what we found in this work .",
    "when @xmath11 , the quasiparticles will also participate the transport .",
    "due to the fermionic nature of quasiparticles , it will partially cancel the positive contribution of the entangled electron pair to the cross correlation .",
    "the competition of these two contributions from the entangled electron pair and quasiparticles can lead to either positive or negative cross correlation depending on which contribution dominates .",
    "we begin with the following model hamiltonian @xmath12 + \\sum_{\\sigma } \\epsilon_{0 } d_{\\sigma } ^{+}d_{\\sigma }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sum_{p\\sigma } [ t_{1,p}c_{1,p\\sigma } ^{+}d_{\\sigma } + c.c . ]",

    "we set @xmath17 .",
    "the other terms in eq.([ham ] ) are hamiltonians describing the couplings between the quantum dot and leads . to simplify the discussion ,",
    "we have assumed that two superconducting leads have the same gap energy @xmath4 .",
    "we have also neglected the supercurrent between two superconducting leads@xcite and assumed that the hopping matrix elements are independent of the spin index .    in the following",
    ", we will calculate the cross correlation between two partial beams through two superconducting leads .",
    "the current operator for the superconducting lead 2 or 3 is    @xmath18 with @xmath19 = ie\\sum_{k}[t_{\\alpha k}c_{\\alpha , k\\sigma } ^{+}d_{\\sigma } -c.c.]\\ ] ] where @xmath20 . due to the electron - hole symmetry of the system",

    "we first use eq.([final1 ] ) to calculate the cross correlation at finite voltage while keeping @xmath77 . in the following , we will use @xmath4 as the unit of energy and study the symmetric case where @xmath78 . in fig.1",
    "we show the cross correlation versus the gate voltage at fixed external bias @xmath79 .",
    "four different sets of coupling constants @xmath80 are chosen : ( 1 ) . @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in this case",
    ", it represents the strong coupling between leads and the quantum dot .",
    "the cross correlation ( solid line ) displays two broad peaks located symmetrically at @xmath83 .",
    "( 2 ) . @xmath81 and @xmath84 . in this case , the normal lead couples strongly with the quantum dot while the superconducting leads couple weakly .",
    "the cross correlation ( dotted line ) exhibits a single peak at @xmath85 .",
    "( 3 ) . @xmath86 and @xmath82 .",
    "this is the reverse of case ( 2 ) .",
    "we see that the cross correlation ( dot - dashed line ) shows a flat region near @xmath85 .",
    "( 4 ) . @xmath86 and @xmath84 .",
    "this is the weak coupling case .",
    "the cross correlation ( dashed line ) has two sharp peaks close to @xmath85 and decays quickly away from it . to understand these features",
    ", we notice that two terms ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) in eq.([final1 ] ) tend to cancel each other . in the strong coupling case ,",
    "the contribution from both terms are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "both show broad peak near @xmath85 with the second term decreasing faster away from @xmath85 ( see fig.2a ) . as a result",
    ", we obtain the double - peak structure as shown in fig.1 .",
    "when @xmath81 and @xmath84 , the contribution from @xmath89 is much smaller than that of @xmath90 and hence just one peak shows up ( fig.2b ) . for @xmath86 and @xmath82 ,",
    "the addition of @xmath90 and @xmath89 gives a long plateau between @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( fig.2c ) .",
    "in the weak coupling regime , @xmath90 and @xmath89 give comparable contributions with a single peak .",
    "similar to the strong coupling case , the integral of @xmath89 decreases faster than that of @xmath90 resulting again a double - peak structure ( fig.2d ) .",
    "as one decreases the external bias to @xmath93 , the cross correlation in the strong coupling case still shows double peak structure with smaller amplitude ( fig.3 ) .",
    "we also find that the peak position is shifted towards origin and peak to valley ratio becomes much smaller . in the weak coupling regime ,",
    "the cross correlation is roughly unchanged . in the case of @xmath81 and @xmath84 ( or vice versa ) , the cross correlation decreases .",
    "now we examine the cross correlation versus external bias at fixed energy levels .",
    "fig.4a displays the cross correlation @xmath76 versus external voltage when @xmath94 .",
    "we see that , except for @xmath81 and @xmath84 that @xmath76 increases monotonically , @xmath76 develops a plateau region for the other three sets of coupling parameters .",
    "these plateau regions are due to the resonant tunneling which can be seen from fig.4b where the differential cross correlation @xmath95 versus external voltage is depicted . here",
    "we see typical behavior of the shot noise@xcite : a minimum separated by two peaks .",
    "the minimum is due to the resonant andreev reflection since @xmath96 .",
    "as one increases the energy level ( @xmath97 ) , the dip between two peaks can no longer reach zero indicating that the maximum andreev reflection coefficient @xmath98 is much less than one .",
    "we also note that for @xmath86 and @xmath82 , only one peak is left and resonant feature disappeared .    to study the effect of quasiparticle when @xmath99",
    ", we calculate the cross correlation using eq.([final ] ) .",
    "fig.6 shows the cross correlation versus external voltage at @xmath100 .",
    "we see that once the voltage is larger than the gap energy @xmath4 , the cross correlation decreases quickly indicating fermionic contributions . for the strong coupling case ,",
    "@xmath76 becomes negative in the large @xmath73 limit .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "when @xmath11 , electrons with energy less than @xmath3 will all participate in transport .",
    "in particular , for incoming electrons with energy inside the superconducting gap , only two - electron current is allowed and hence the contribution to the cross correlation should be positive as we just discussed above . however , when the energy of incoming electron is outside of the gap the current comes from of four processes@xcite : ( 1 ) .",
    "andreev reflection ; ( 2 ) . the conventional electron tunneling through the system ; ( 3 ) .",
    "`` branch crossing '' process@xcite : an electron incident from the normal lead converting into a hole like in the superconducting leads ; ( 4 ) . an electron ( or a hole ) incident from the normal lead tunnels into the superconducting lead , picks up a quasiparticle ( or a quasihole ) in the superconducting lead and creates ( or annihilates ) a cooper pair . in these processes ,",
    "the latter three give negative contributions to the cross correlation .",
    "competition between andreev reflection process and the rest of three processes give rise either positive or negative cross correlation depending on which process dominates ( see fig.6 ) . typically , near the resonance",
    "the breit - wigner form for the andreev reflection coefficient reads@xcite    @xmath101    and transmission coefficient for normal tunneling process @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we see that the andreev reflection is suppressed when off resonance . furthermore , at large external bias if the resonant energy is outside of the gap , the andreev reflection is drastically suppressed and normal tunneling is allowed at certain energy .",
    "therefore , we expect negative cross correlation in this case . in fig.7",
    ", we depict @xmath76 versus @xmath73 at @xmath105 . since the resonant level is outside of the gap , the plateau region for @xmath76 when @xmath3 is inside the gap disappeared .",
    "we see that except for the case of @xmath81 and @xmath84 , @xmath76 becomes negative at large voltages .",
    "our numerical result shows that at even larger @xmath106 , the transport of quasiparticle dominates and all @xmath76 are negative at large external voltage .",
    "finally , we plot in fig.8 the @xmath76 versus @xmath107 at @xmath108 .",
    "we see that at large voltages , all the cross correlation functions become negative . for the strong coupling case",
    ", we observe oscillations of @xmath76 between bosonic and fermionic behaviors due to the competition between entangled electron pair and the quasiparticles .",
    "this can be easily checked experimentally by changing the gate voltage .    in summary ,",
    "we have proposed an entangled electron pair hbt experiment by using the three - terminal n - s - s hybrid mesoscopic system . when the external voltage is less than the gap energy , only two - electron current is present .",
    "the cross correlation is found to be positive , which demonstrates that this entangled electron pair looks like the composite boson and tends to bunch in cluster . however , when the external voltage is larger than the gap energy the quasiparticle will participate the transport which gives the fermionic contribution to the cross correlation . as the result of competition between andreev reflection process and the other tunneling process involving quasiparticles , the cross correlation can be either positive or negative depending on which one dominates . for the strong coupling case and at large external voltage , the cross correlation function changes sign as one varys the gate voltage which controls the position of the resonant level",
