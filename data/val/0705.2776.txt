    "an essential point in determining cosmological parameters is the independence of the procedure of the classical methods , which have come to be classical , such as deep three - dimensional surveys of galaxies and clusters , 1a  type supernovae ( see , for instance , leibundgut 2001 ) or relic radiation ( for instance efstathiou et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "one of the independent techniques is based on the datings associated with the age of galaxies ( for instance , saini et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "the first attempts to estimate @xmath2 with the use of ages stellar systems were made a few years ago ( see , for instance , parijskij , 2001 ) proposed by jimenez and loeb ( 2002 ) .",
    "it is based on the datings connected with variations of ages of galaxies determined by the spectroscopic technique .",
    "such an approach makes it possible to construct an independent chronological scale applicable to the early stages of evolution of the universe .",
    "this approach is based on measurements of differences of the ages @xmath8 between two passively evolving galaxies which form at the same time but separated by a small interval @xmath9",
    ". then one can determine the finite difference @xmath10 .",
    "all the galaxies in the procedure proposed by jimenez and loeb must have alike metallicities and low rates of star formation ( i.e. red colors ) , while the mean age of the system must be considerably larger than the difference of ages of galaxies @xmath11 . by applying this differential method ,",
    "jimenez and loeb ( 2002 ) suggest h(z ) and @xmath12 to be measured directly from the first and second derivatives @xmath0 @xmath13 :    @xmath14    @xmath15 ^ 2}{(1+z)}\\left    [ \\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{3}{2}\\omega_q(z )    \\right]-\\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{3}{2}\\omega_m(0)(1+z)^4\\omega_q(z)\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by proposing this differential method , the authors show that it is necessary both to increase the sample of galaxies and to improve the signal / noise ratio .",
    "we have used a similar method but with another type of dating of the age , namely , from photometric data and choosing optimum consistency of the distribution of energy in the spectrum ( sed ) , depending on age , by the observed fluxes .",
    "this procedure , which has already become standard , operates with sufficient stability for a pure sample of elliptical galaxies ( see , for instance , verkhodanov et al . , 1999 ) , though it may give an error in the age up to 2 gyr .",
    "the methods using color and spectral ages of galaxies are based on chronometrying the rates of expansion of the universe from physical processes not associated with cosmology : from the rates of nuclear reactions in stars , the knowledge of which for standard stars of the solar type are accurate enough and in the last decade have obtained numerous direct and indirect confirmations , including the latest achievements of acoustic tomography of the entrails of the sun .",
    "for this reason , the proposed method of chronometrying the evolution of the universe resembles those of chronometrying on earth from the data of radioactive decay and in any case is independent of others .",
    "note that giant elliptical galaxies with high radio luminosity and with the old stellar population are the most suitable objects for estimating the age of stellar systems .",
    "the present - day models predict fast enough ( during 1 billion years ) formation of such systems at @xmath16 ( pipino & mantencci 2004 ) , which enables application of photometric methods to their investigation .",
    "the efficiency of selecting such galaxies with the aid of radio astronomy methods , beginning from moderate redshifts ( @xmath17 ) is confirmed by several groups ( pedani 2003 ) . a combined diagram of hubble `` k  z '' for radio galaxies and field galaxies ( jarvis et al . 2001 ; de breauk et al . 2002 )",
    "show that radio galaxies have the highest luminosity at any redshift @xmath18 ( reuland et al . , 2003 ) . besides , radio galaxies have supermassive black holes whose mass is generally proportional to a stellar bulge one ( @xmath19 , maggorrian et al . 1998 ) , and this fact is additional evidence of the presence of an already formed stellar population .",
    "note that the estimate of the age of distant galaxies is also of interest in connection with searching for primeval black holes with masses @xmath20 .",
    "formation of radio galaxies at redshifts @xmath21 provide the already formed stellar populations at @xmath22 in the @xmath4cdm models .",
    "thus , when selecting distant radio galaxies , we isolate with sufficient efficiency giant elliptical galaxies which can be used to estimate the age of a stellar population and to investigate the ratio @xmath23 ( parijskij 2001 ; verkhodanov & parijskij 2003 , starobinsky et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the present paper describes approaches , methods and results concerning cosmological parameters estimates using samples of elliptical galaxies .",
    "we will discuss , first , the problems connected with the use of evolutionary synthetic models of spectra of galaxies .",
    "then , using the data on the `` big trio '' project ( parijskij et al . 1996 , 2000a , 2000b ; parijskij 2001 ; soboleva et al .",
    "2000 ; kopylov et al .",
    "1995 ; verkhodanov et al .",
    "2002 ) and other authors ( verkhodanov et al .",
    "1999 ) we will present results of the first attempts of correction of the standard cosmological model with cold dark matter ( scdm ) by means of age estimates of parent galaxies responsible for the origin of powerful radio galaxies at large redshifts . further we will give a summary of attempts to estimate the relationship between the age of galaxies and their redshifts from the current evolutionary models of the stellar population of elliptical galaxies for a wider interval of redshifts , including close , @xmath24 , objects .",
    "at the end of the 1980s and in the early 1990s attempts were made to employ color characteristics of radio galaxies to estimate redshifts and ages of stellar systems of parent galaxies .",
    "numerous evolutionary models were proposed , which led to result strongly different from one another in comparing with observational data ( arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; chambers & charlot 1990 ; lilly 1987,1990 ; parijskij et al .",
    "1996 ) . over the past few years",
    "the models pegase : project deetude des galaxies par synthese evolutive ( fioc & rocca - volmerange , 1997 ) and gissel98 : galaxy isochrone syntheses spectral evolution library ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ; bolzonella et al . , 2000 ) , in which the defects of previous models were eliminated , have been widely used .    in the `` big trio '' experiment ( parijskij et al .",
    "1996 ) we also attempted to apply these methods to distant objects of the rc catalog with steep spectra , for which we measured the values in the four filters ( bvri ) .",
    "the procedure of smoothing was used , which made it possible to simulate and predict the flux in the given filter with the given sed with allowance made for the filter response function of this band and also with the effects of the redshift allowed for .",
    "these changes in the procedure permitted the results to be more reliable in comparison with the previous paper work .",
    "preliminarily ( verkhodanov et al . 1999 ) we investigated applicability of new models to populations of distant ( @xmath25 ) radio galaxies with the known redshifts , for which we have managed to find in the literature more or less reliable data of multicolor photometry in the optical and near - infrared not less than in three filters . in particular , it is shown that redshifts can be estimated to an accuracy @xmath26 at @xmath27 , given the measured stellar magnitudes in more than three filters .",
    "but if , at least , one brightness estimate in the infrared range is available , than it suffices to use measurements in the tree filters .",
    "estimations were made for two evolutionary models pegase ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) , which was constructed for the galaxies of the hubble sequence both with star formation and passively evolving .",
    "one of the advantages of this model consists in the extension to the near - ir ( nir ) range of the atlas of the synthetic spectra of rocca - volmerange and guiderdoni 1988 ) .",
    "this model reconsiders a library of stellar spectra which is computed with allowance made for parameters of cold stars .",
    "the model covers a range from 220   to 5 microns . according to the authors , the algorithm of the model traces rapid evolutionary phases , such as those of the red supergiant or agb in the near - ir range . for the computation",
    "a wide set of sed curves was used for massive elliptical galaxies in a range of ages @xmath28 years to @xmath29 years .",
    "we have also used the computations for the elliptical galaxies of the library of synthetic spectra of the model gissel98 ( bolzonella et al .",
    "the spectra are constructed with the aid of the evolutionary models of bruzual and charlot ( 1993,1996 ) . for the calculation of the synthetic spectra of the elliptical galaxies of this library ,",
    "the following parameters of star formation were assigned : simple star formation ( ssp  simple stellar population ) , the duration of the process of star formation is 1 billion years , while decaying of the burst activity of star formation proceeds by an exponential law . the model used solar metallicity .",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) with an upper limit of 125 solar masses has been taken from the paper by miller and scalo ( 1979 ) . as is shown in the paper by bolzonella et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the choice of the imf does not effect the accuracy of determination of redshifts .",
    "the model tracks are calculated in a wavelength range from 200 to 95800 . for our computations",
    "we have used the range assigned by a redshift limit from 0 to 6 .",
    "the sets of evolutionary models are accessible at the server http://sed.sao.ru ( verkhodanov et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "prior to the application of model curves we carried out their smoothing by the filters with the application of the following algorithm ( verkhodanov et al . , 2002 ) :",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath31 is the initial model sed curve , @xmath32 is the one smoothed by the @xmath33-th , @xmath34(z ) is the curve of transmission of the @xmath33-th filter `` compressed '' @xmath35 times when moving along the axies of the point in the filter response function . from the @xmath33 curves of sed thus formed , we have constructed a two - dimension array ( @xmath36filter ) of smoothed synthetic stellar spectra for further computations .",
    "the estimation of ages and redshifts of radio galaxies was made by the method choosing on the smoothing curves of sed of optimum positions of photometric values obtained in different bands in the observations of galaxies .",
    "we have used sed curves already computed and stored in tables for different ages .",
    "the algorithm of the choice of optimum position of points on the curve consisted ( verkhodanov 1996 ) in shifting the observational points along the sed curves .",
    "in so doing , such a position was found at which the sum of the squares of the departures of the points from the corresponding smoothed curves is minimum , i.e. the minimum of @xmath37 was actually computed @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath33 is the observed stellar magnitude in the @xmath33-th filter , @xmath40 is the model stellar magnitude for the given spectral distribution in the @xmath33-th filter at the given @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the free coefficient , @xmath43 is the measurement error .",
    "the redshift was determined from the shift of the position of the observed magnitudes at their best position on the sed curves from the position `` rest frame '' . from the general set of curves we chose such ones on which the sum of the squares of discrepancies for the given observations of radio galaxies prove to be minimum .",
    "we checked the correctness of estimates of ages ( and redshifts ) by 2 methods . in the first one we took synthetic spectra obtained by means of smoothing by filters the sed curves for different age .",
    "this procedure made it possible to simulate ccd observations for 5 filters .",
    "further the points were chosen corresponding to the filters vijhr , for instance , at the redshift @xmath44 and also the model gissel with seds for 1015.1 and 5000  myr .",
    "two tests were applied for each age to estimate the value : with fixed @xmath44 and unfixed redshift . from the results of testing a conclusion",
    "can be drawn that the age and redshift are defined reliably , however , a falling on neighboring curve of ages is possible , which gives an error of 200  myr , while at unfixed @xmath41 the result is also affected the discretization in wavelength @xmath36 in the sed curves ( the error in @xmath41 is up to 60% ) .    in the second case capabilities",
    "were studied of the method of determination of the redshifts and ages of the stellar population of parent galaxies from the data of multicolor photometry . for this purpose",
    ", we have selected about 40 distant galaxies with known redshifts , for which stellar magnitudes in not fewer than four filters ( verkhodanov et al .",
    ", 1998b , 1999 ) are presented in the literature . at first , using the selected photometric data with the use of the models pegase and gissel98 only ages of the stellar population of parent galaxies at a fixed known redshift were determined .",
    "then a search was made for an optimum model of the sed curve with a simultaneous determination of the redshift and age of the stellar population .",
    "after that a comparison of the obtained values was made . by this method",
    "we estimated both the age of the galaxy and the redshift within the framework of the given models ( see also verkhodanov et al . 1998a , 1999 ) .",
    "it is clear from general considerations that the reliability of the result at large redshifts is strongly affected by the presence of infrared data ( up to the k range ) because when fitting we overlap the region of rapid jump of the spectrum before the region of sed , and thereby we can reliably , with a well defined maximum on the plausibility curve , determine the position of our data . indeed , when checking the reliability of the procedure with the aid of the measurements available with keeping of only 3 points , one of which is in the k range , we obtain the same result on the plausibility function as from 4 or 5 points .",
    "if the infrared range is not used , then the result turns out to be more uncertain .",
    "however , as it is shown in the paper by verkhodanov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the variant of 4 filters close disposition as in our case of bvri photometry yielded a good result in the sample of 6 objects .",
    "this result coincides with the one obtained when all the filters were used , including the infrared range .",
    "it should be noted that the choice of elliptical galaxies as objects for our investigation is not accidental .",
    "they can be considered as the most optimum objects among stellar systems having a homogeneous enough stellar population .",
    "although such objects have ( moderate ) metallicity gradients ( friaca & terlevich 1998 ) , the modeling showed ( jimenez , loeb , 2002 ) that the variation of metallicity leads to an uncertainty of estimates of the age within 0.1 gyr , which lies inside uncertainties of estimates .    in the given investigation we use radio galaxies which , as a rule , are identified with giant elliptical galaxies ( ge ) and are good `` lanterns '' and representatives of distant stellar systems .",
    "the standard point of view of the last decades has been that powerful radio galaxies are associated with old huge stellar system of the ge - type having the red color .",
    "the experience of using globular clusters in our galaxy to estimate the age of the universe shows that the search for the oldest stellar systems at large redshifts may be useful for chronometrying of the rates of expansion of the universe at any distances at which powerful radio galaxies still existed . as many groups ( rawlings et al .",
    "1996 ; van beugel et al 1999 ) , including the project `` big trio '' ( soboleva et al . 2000 ) have shown that powerful galaxies appeared at redshifts of about 5 .",
    "the whole interval @xmath45 can be potentially investigated even today since the sensitivity of radio and optical telescopes is sufficient for investigation of such powerful radio and optical objects .",
    "in contrast to quasars , the radiation of the stellar population can be readily isolated from that of the gaseous component .",
    "note , however , that in radio galaxies uncertainties arise in photometric determination of the age because of different factors ( see , for example , moy & rocca - volmerange , 2002 ) , such as ionization and transillumination of the radiation from the nucleus , interaction of clouds and jets etc .",
    "besides , the galaxies at early stages could be interacting , which changes the stellar population .",
    "nevertheless , the radio galaxies remain so far the only simple means of studying elliptical galaxies at large redshifts .",
    "the given sample is composed from frii - type galaxies found in the ratan-600 survey `` cold '' ( parijskij et al .",
    ", 1991 , 1992 ) with involvement of data of multicolor photometry for estimating color redshifts and ages of stellar systems of parent galaxies ( parijskij et al . 1996 ; verkhodanov et al . 2002 ) . later , spectral observations at bta with the device scorpio ( afanasiev et al .",
    "2002 ) were carried out , which confirmed with high accuracy ( correlation coefficient 0.92 ) the photometric estimates .    in the program `` big trio '' bvri values of about 60 radio galaxies",
    "were estimated , and it was discovered that although the color age does not have a large dispersion , the upper limit of the age is a sufficiently reliable function of redshift ( the larger z , the less the maximum age ) . a comparison of this upper limit with the scdm model showed that age is not at variance with the scdm model without the cosmological constant @xmath4 , but in the interval @xmath46 there are objects with the color age greater than the age of the universe at the corresponding redshift .",
    "such a situation , as it is known ( see , for instance , sahni and starobinsky 2000 ) is eliminated in the @xmath4cdm models . indeed ,",
    "the age of such a universe does not differ from the scdm model either at very small or at very large redshifts , which is seen from the formulae presented in the paper mentioned .    however ,",
    "in the interval of redshifts @xmath47 the difference may reach 12 billion years , which is close to the possibilities of the experiment .",
    "the simple theory @xmath48 for a spatially flat isotopic cosmological model yields a relationship between the position of a maximum of departures from the scdm model on the axis of redshifts and the value of cosmological constant . the first attempts to estimate the value of the cosmological constant from the `` big trio '' data were made in 1999 ( parijskij 2001 ) . in connection with the uncertainty in quantitative estimates of the age of galaxies from the measured redshifts , percentage of galaxies whose age formally exceeds that of the universe in the scdm model with @xmath49 was estimated .",
    "then a histogram of distribution of number of these galaxies as a function of @xmath41 was constructed ( fig.1 ) .    from the position of the maximum the proportion of `` dark matter '' ( @xmath2 ) which turned out to be close to the value derived from 1a ",
    "type supenovae was estimated : @xmath50 ( fig.2 ) .",
    "this result stimulated our further steps in the usage of age characteristics of the stellar population .",
    "fig.3 shows all the data collected by the group `` big trio '' in 2001 from steep spectrum radio galaxies .",
    "it is seen that there present objects with large @xmath41 , but at @xmath51 dispersion of ages is great .",
    "but the larger the redshift , the less the age of the oldest object , as it was to be expected in all evolutionary models of the universe .",
    "having chosen a population of objects the age of which is younger than that of the universe in the @xmath4cdm model by more than 2 billion years , obtain a relationship @xmath52 similar to the one displayed in fig.4    the relationship of such a type can already serve as a basis for estimating @xmath53 .",
    "as it was stated above , to check the procedure and estimate redshifts and age of stellar systems , we made a sample of radio galaxies frii with redshifts up to @xmath54 ( verkhodanov et al .",
    "1998b , 1999 ) using data obtained by other authors .",
    "it should be noted that literature photometric data are very inhomogeneous .",
    "they were obtained not only by different authors but also with the help of different instruments with different filters .",
    "it was not always that measurements for one and the same object were made with equal apertures etc .",
    "for this reason , after the final selection from 300 radio galaxies of the initial sample only 42 remained . the greater part of the sample turned out to be beyond the limits of the sample because they have the properties of quasars , which impedes strongly the use of the procedure sed for standard elliptical galaxies    [ cols=\"^,<,<,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      this method of determination of @xmath3 and @xmath2 is stable enough concerning the input parameters and systematic effect .",
    "as the modeling has shown the variation of the initial metallicity caused a change in the age by 0.1gyr ( jimenez & loeb 2002 ) .",
    "the change in the initial mass function does not affect the model sed either ( bolzonella et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the error in the determination of the age , which may be connected with wrong classification of the galaxy type and , therefore , with the choice of sed , plays in this case in favor of the approach being described .",
    "the models sed corresponding to elliptical galaxies give the oldest stellar population among all the spectra .",
    "thus , if in the galaxy are found star formation regions giving a contribution to photometric data , then the choice of the optimum model is displaced toward a younger stellar population , and the galaxy falls out from our sample .    to check the influence of the sample completeness on the result",
    ", we used the bootstrap method consisting in multiplying of the initial sample and in constructing a new one by means of accidental choice of objects .",
    "the coefficient of multiplying the sample was taken to be equal to 100 , and for each interval @xmath55 the number of objects equal to the initial number was chosen in an accidental manner .",
    "50 tests were thus applied , and in each case the values of the parameters were estimated . as a result ,",
    "dispersion of the estimates @xmath56 for the model gissel and @xmath57 for the model pegase for the interval @xmath58 were obtained .",
    "we should note that accuracy of @xmath59 for the hubble parameter is the inner accuracy of the method , and actually one elder galaxy than existing in the sample can shift the estimate , but not far .",
    "the values of @xmath2 remained unchanged , which is explained by the influence of objects at moderate redshifts @xmath60 having a relatively small dispersion of ages .",
    "we disregarded the effect of the interval selfabsorption in the galaxy ( sokolov et al .",
    "2001 ) because of the ambiguity of solutions for a small number of the used input parameters ( number of filters ) in our case and the necessity for the determination of a large number of unknown parameters .",
    "the possible great contribution to the discrepancy in the approximation of the relationships , which produces the effect of accidental errors , can be considerably reduced by further statistical accumulation of data since the number of known galaxies of type frii will amount by different estimates to a few thousand in the near future .",
    "the results of our paper confirm , firstly , that we live in an evolving universe . secondly , that in contrast to the standard relativistic flat model @xmath4cdm is situated within the errors of the method . to estimate the quintessence @xmath12 , the accuracy is not sufficient yet . for the united data of different populations of elliptical galaxies , for radio galaxies too , an analysis was made of the upper limit of the age of formation of stellar systems . from these data boundaries of determination of the cosmological parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4term were estimated : @xmath7 , and @xmath61 in the model pegase .",
    "note that the models gissel have lower dispersion of ages for each interval , i.e. they give a more stable result and , possibly , as a consequence , more reliable cosmological parameters .",
    "the discrepancies of the relationship @xmath23 decrease and , therefore , the accuracy of estimates of parameters , when changing from the interval @xmath62 to the interval @xmath63 , improves , which is explained by more reliable determination of the maximum age at a larger interval .",
    "as far as the procedure applied is concerned , it should be noted that one of the main problems is the use of investigations of radio galaxies in which , apart from standard evolution of stars , the photometric measurements may be affected by other factors as well . nevertheless , new models ( for instance , pegase2 : le borgue & rocca - volmerange 2002 ) which allow these factors to be taken into account , are already beginning to appear .",
    "\\1 ) use of age characteristics of galaxies for independent estimates of cosmological parameters is prospective ; example  the estimate of the @xmath4term , which can be improved by extending the sample and employing more refined models ;      \\3 ) preliminary selection of candidates must be performed by different ways since none of the known ones is ideal . the relatively powerful radiation ( the ratio of radio luminosity to optical ) points to the fact that we deal with a giant galaxy with a supermassive black hole in the center , which requires time to be formed .",
    "unfortunately , there is no generally accepted theory of their formation .",
    "the proposal to use objects in well understood clusters also seems to be attractive ( kopylov 2001 ) . because it is exactly from clusters that data for @xmath53 at small redshifts were obtained .",
    "the use of the upper values of the age in the samples at different redshifts seems to be justified .",
    "even one the oldest object in the sample is decisive in the determination of the lower limit of the universe age at the given redshift , similar to that as the only old star in the galaxy ( or the oldest globular cluster ) defines the minimum age of the universe today . in our opinion",
    "the most involved problem is the problem of the theory of evolution of the distribution of energy in the spectrum of galaxies , and here we have considerably various readings .",
