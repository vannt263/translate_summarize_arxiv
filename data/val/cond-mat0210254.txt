    "coherent control of quantum systems has been attracted considerable attentions in recent years . a basic ingredient of quantum control is field - induced localization of a single electron in a double - trap@xcite .",
    "the initial efforts devoted to acquiring conditions to maintain existing localization with oscillatory electric field , and to create and maintain localization with a semi - infinite oscillatory field@xcite .",
    "it was found that the investigation of localization can be approximated by a two - state model consisting of the lowest symmetric and antisymmetric states of the double - trap potential@xcite . in this case",
    ", perfect localization can be achieved with a strong time - periodic electric field that causes the floquet quasienergies to be degenerate .",
    "later , localization in superlattice systems@xcite , in dissipative environments@xcite , in molecular systems@xcite , induced by ultrashort laser pulses , and in trapped bose - einstein condensates@xcite , by means of oscillatory magnetic fields , has been studied .    when two or more interacting particles are present , apart from the highly nontrivial problem of whether the strong many - body interaction can be overcome for the particles to create and preserve localization , the possibility of entanglement of the many - body wave functions arises@xcite .",
    "entanglement is an essential ingredient in any scheme of quantum information processing like quantum information cryptography and quantum computation , and therefore it is a problem of great current interest to find or design systems where entanglement can be manipulated@xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical and experimental activity until now has been associated with atomic and quantum - optic systems .",
    "two- @xcite , three-@xcite , and four - particle @xcite entanglement have been successfully demonstrated experimentally in trapped ions , rydberg atoms , and cavity qed .",
    "however , a further increase of the number of entangled particles in these systems is expected to be a severe experimental challenge . recently , solid - state realizations of the entanglement have received increasingly attention due to the fact that semiconductor nanostructures such as quantum dots ( qds ) and double quantum dots ( dqds ) with well - defined atom - like and molecule - like properties , have been fabricated and studied by many groups @xcite .",
    "kane @xcite has proposed a scheme which encodes information onto the nuclear spins of donor atoms in doped silicon electronic devices where externally applied electric fields are used to perform logical operations on individual spins .",
    "loss and divincenzo@xcite have presented a scheme based on spin exchange interaction effects .",
    "more recently , imamoglu _ et al_. @xcite have considered a quantum computer model based on both electron spins and cavity qed which is capable of realizing controlled interactions between two distant quantum dots .",
    "quiroga and johnson @xcite have suggested that the resonant transfer interaction between spatially separated excitons in quantum dots can be exploited to produce maximally entangled bell states .    in the present work we study the coherent control of the quantum system consisting of two interacting electrons in a coupled quantum dot ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . with the initial state chosen to be in the spin - singlet space , the dynamics",
    "is reduced to be confined to a three - dimensional hilbert space , in which the three basis vectors are equivalent to the eigenstates of @xmath0 component of spin-1 operator .",
    "we show that the maximally entangled bell state can be prepared and maintained with a pulse of oscillatory electric field .",
    "also we find that although the coulomb repulsion between the two electrons is very strong , dynamical localization can fully build up in the system parameter manifold which corresponds to the exact crossing of the quasienergies developed from the unperturbed nearly - degenerate levels .",
    "the hamiltonian which we use to describe the dynamics of two interacting electrons in a coupled quantum dot driven by electric fields is    @xmath1    @xmath2    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the coulomb interaction and @xmath5 the single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "the dielectric constant @xmath6 and the effective mass @xmath7 are material parameters .",
    "the potential @xmath8 in @xmath5 describes the lateral confinement , whereas @xmath9 models the vertical double - well structure .",
    "the lateral coupling of the dots is modeled by a quartic potential @xmath10 where we have introduced the isotropy parameter @xmath11 determining the strength of the vertical relative to the lateral confinement . the lateral effective bohr radius @xmath12 is a measure for the lateral extension of the electron wave function in the dots . it has been shown in experiments with electrically gated quantum dots in a two - dimensional electron system that the electronic spectrum is well described by a simple harmonic oscillator@xcite . in describing the confinement @xmath9 along the inter - dot axis , we have used a ( locally harmonic ) double well potential of the form    @xmath13    which separates into two harmonic wells of frequency @xmath14(one for each dot ) in the limit @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is half the distance between the dots and @xmath17 is the vertical effective bohr radius .",
    "although in principle a square - well potential would be a more accurate description of the real potential than the harmonic double well , we believe there is no qualitative difference between the results presented below obtained with harmonic potential and the corresponding results using square - well potential . finally , the time - dependent electric field has a dc - ac form , i.e. , @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "following burkard _ et al_.[22 ] we employ the hund - mulliken method of molecular orbits to describe the low - lying spectrum of our system .",
    "this approach accounts for double occupancies and is therefore suitable for investigating the questions at issue here . as a starting point for our calculations",
    "we consider the problem of an electron in a single quantum dot .",
    "the one - particle hamiltonian by which we describe a single electron in the right ( left ) dot of the double - dot system is @xmath20 and has the ground - state solution    @xmath21    corresponding to ground - state energy @xmath22 .",
    "the two local ground states are not orthogonal and their overlap is    @xmath23    where the dimensionless parameter @xmath24 denotes the distance between the two dots .",

    "we generate six basis functions with respect to which we diagonalize the two - particle hamiltonian @xmath34 : the states with double occupation , @xmath35 [ denoted by ( 1,0,0,0)@xmath36 and ( 0,1,0,0)@xmath36 , respectively ] and the states with single occupation @xmath37 $ ] [ denoted by ( 0,0,1,0)@xmath36 and ( 0,0,0,1)@xmath36 , respectively ] . calculating the matrix elements of the hamiltonian @xmath38 in this orthonormal basis",

    "@xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) describes the coupling strength between the electrons and external electric fields .    obviously the spin - triplet state @xmath54 is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( 8) with the electron number on each quantum dot invariably one and has no response to the presence of the electric fields",
    "this is one important fact involving spin - triplet space .",
    "hence we will focus our attention on the reduced spin - singlet hamiltonian @xmath55 .",

    "( 15 ) that due to strong coulomb repulsion , the symmetric ground state is dominated by the delocalized state @xmath89 , whereas , the other two eigenstates are nearly degenerate and dominated by the two localized states @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "note that although @xmath92 and @xmath93 look like a doublet in a single - electron double - trap system which consists of a pair of symmetric and antisymmetric single - particle states , there are fundamental differences for the present two - particle system .",
    "in fact , the superposition of the two localized states @xmath90 and @xmath91 implies that the spatial wave functions of the two electrons have been entangled , in the usual sense that they are not factorized into single - particle states . to describe the degree of entanglement",

    "therefore the probability @xmath96 for finding the maximally entangled bell state in a coupled quantum dot is given by    @xmath97    in the following we will investigate the various energy spectrum and consequent dynamics for a gaas ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) system comprising two equal dots with vertical confinement energy @xmath100mev ( @xmath101 nm ) and lateral confinement energy @xmath102mev .",

    "this trivial way of keeping localization in a two - electron double - dot system originates from the fact that , due to the presence of constant electric field , the consequent energy mismatch among the three two - particle states prohibit tunneling from the localized state @xmath73 to the other states .    another way to implement localized two - particle state is through adiabatically varying the constant electric field , which induces a series of avoided crossings in the energy spectrum .",

    "more surprisingly , we notice that compared with non - interacting ( @xmath235 ) case , the presence of coulomb repulsion enhances the degree of localization to a larger extent . to illustrate this feature we present in fig .",
    "10(c ) time evolution of @xmath232 with the parameters corresponding to the first exact crossing of the quasienergies in the absence of coulomb interaction .",
    "it shows in fig .",
    "10(c ) that although dynamical localization maintains during time development , the degree of localization is much lower than that shown in fig .",
    "10(a ) , suggesting coulomb - enhanced localization . from eq .",
    "( 15 ) we know that due to strong coulomb interaction , the initial localized state @xmath236 .",
    "thus from what we have learned in single - particle double - trap system , it is not difficult to understand why the localization can be dynamically remained at the exact crossing of two floquet states developed from @xmath237 and @xmath93 .",
    "similarly , in the absence of coulomb interaction , the initial localized state @xmath91 can be approximated by a superposition of all three eigenstates as @xmath238 , suggesting dynamical localization at the crossing among three quasienergies . however",
    ", the fundamental difference lies in the fact that when the strong interaction is present , the tunneling coupling is @xmath239 . in the absence of coulomb interaction , whereas , the tunneling coupling is @xmath240 .",
    "thus we can see that the coupling between the two localized states greatly decreases in the presence of strong coulomb interaction , which leads to fundamental increase of localization degree .",
    "we turn to study the dynamics of the system at the crossing of the quasienergies @xmath212 and @xmath241 in fig .",
    "9(b ) , using the same initial state condition .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "in contrary to that shown in fig .",
    "10(a ) , it shows in fig .",
    "10(d ) that at the level crossing of @xmath212  and @xmath241 dynamical localization does not happen and @xmath116 oscillates between @xmath233 and @xmath234 . note that the level crossing of @xmath212  and @xmath242 induces strong participation of the floquet state @xmath243 during the time evolution of the system , and the most component in @xmath244 is the delocalized two - particle state @xmath74 .",
    "therefore the strong mixture of the floquet state @xmath243 in the evolution of the system will lead to complete destruction of the dynamical localization , as shown in fig .",
    "10(d ) .",
    "in the above discussions we have ignored higher - lying single - particle states ; this requires that the frequency of the external field is much lower than single - particle level spacing . in the presence of decoherence due to environmental dissipation , long dephasing time should be required .",
    "a detailed analysis of the effect of a decohering environment will be given elsewhere .",
    "in conclusion we have shown how dynamical localization and entanglement of two interacting electrons in a double quantum dot system can be accessed by external electric fields .",
    "we have found that ( i ) the presence of a constant electric field may induce the complete rabi oscillation between the delocalized state @xmath74 and localized state @xmath73 . thus starting from the delocalized ground state",
    ", we can prepare a fully localized state .",
    "the localization can be maintained by switching the field to another nonzero value .",
    "( ii ) the two electrons oscillate between the delocalized state and two localized states in the presence of a resonant oscillatory field . with",
    "the oscillatory field turned off at time when the probabilities for finding the electrons in the left and right dot are identically @xmath153 , the two electrons remain maximally entangled in the subsequent time evolution .",
    "thus a selective pulse of oscillatory field can be used to implement maximally entangled bell states in a two - electron two - dot system .",
    "( iii ) although the coulomb repulsion is very strong , the two initially localized electrons can stay localized during time evolution .",
    "it is also shown that compared to non - interacting case , the coulomb interaction enhances the degree of localization to a larger extent .",
    "we expect the present results are useful in exploiting the coherent control of electrons in quantum dot systems .",
