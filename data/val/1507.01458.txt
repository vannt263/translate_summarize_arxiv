    "since the seminal work of chamberlin @xcite , the economics literature on monopolistically competitive markets has been rooted on the idea of product differentiation @xcite : goods are provided by many producers in several versions and models , despite they aim at satisfying the very same need .",
    "such a market framework can be easily experienced everyday in real - life markets , where several products compete with each other in offering very similar services to the final consumer .",
    "product differentiation has been studied from two perspectives : ( i ) _ horizontal _ , often referred to as spatial differentiation @xcite , and ( ii ) _ vertical _ @xcite .",
    "if a good is defined as a bundle of characteristics ( in the sense of lancaster @xcite ) , the distinction between horizontal and vertical differentiation is that the former refers to goods with different features and the same qualitative level , whereas the latter takes into account differences in quality .",
    "however , as cremer and thisse have shown @xcite , results of hotelling - type models and vertical differentiation models are basically equivalent . in this paper",
    "we assume that the differentiation has a comprehensive characterization : in fact , different features and qualitative levels will be described in a unique multidimensional environment .",
    "consumer s behavioral choice is studied in the literature from several , yet complementary , points of view . from a buyer s perspective , differentiation among goods",
    "is advantageous insofar as it helps in seeking a feasible good offering the highest satisfaction . in this sense ,",
    "an increase in differentiation is usually associated to a positive value for buyers , because it increases the possibility of a making a selection that is close to an ideal target .",
    "monopolistic competition and oligopoly characterize the largest part of the real market experience .",
    "these two market structures share many common characteristics ; however , they differ from each other in the way the total market output is looked at .",
    "in fact , oligopolistic firms explicitly consider the effect of their role in determining the total market output , whereas monopolistically competitive firms consider the aggregate market output as exogenously given in the process of setting their individual production , @xcite .",
    "we focus our attention on the demand side of a _ monopolistically competitive market _ , where firms supply composition is taken as an exogenous environmental configuration .",
    "our goal is to study a consumer s individual choice process , that is , to analyze the way in which she selects a final product among several version of it supplied by different brands . to this aim",
    ", we make the ( non - simplifying ) assumption that the consumer considers quality , features , and prices as a unified multi - criteria discrimination concept .",
    "market failure due to asymmetric information occurs when the buyer and the seller have two different informative sets and the more aware of them tries to extract a supplementary benefit at the expenses of the other @xcite .",
    "indeed , the case of a consumer who does not know the complete characterization of the goods she needs must be considered : that consumer chooses blinded by her ignorance @xcite .",
    "the result is a lower level of satisfaction than the potential one .",
    "this may require a policy intervention to solve the resulting inefficiency . to further support this point of view ,",
    "consider the perverse effect of differentiation : the  tyranny of choice \"  a term coined by schwartz @xcite  represents the situation when the abundance of available choices on the market may even become undesirable if the consumer can not count on a valid consciousness to guide her selection . in this respect ,",
    "some authors stress the role of advertisement in informing consumers @xcite .",
    "however , adverts may barely provide a neutral source of knowledge .",
    "thus , the model here proposed will show effects of advertising .",
    "the relevance of _ information _ and _ knowledge _ in consumption is widely recognized , because of their ability to influence the consumer s attitude in perception and searching .",
    "indeed , some analysis supports the point of view that a lack of knowledge may truly generate a reduction of the consumer s judgement capacity @xcite . in our opinion",
    "this conclusion can not be fully ascribed to the well - known  bounded rationality \" concept , which appears more linked to the completeness of the informative set , as advocated in @xcite and in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explicitly emphasize the semantic difference between the two concepts of  information \" and  knowledge \" .",
    "our interpretation of these two terms relies on a suggested distinction between ( i ) what the consumer knows with regards to the current transaction being concluded ( which should be considered as `` information '' , as generally accepted in literature ) , and ( ii ) what the consumer knows in a broader sense , in the form of cultural background and capability to understand and to evaluate ( which is a notion of `` knowledge '' ) . the interested reader may refer to existing surveys @xcite .",
    "a possible rationale for the reduction of the consumer s judgement capacity can be ascribed to the complexity of choice environment @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is known that consumers decide to make purchases for many reasons , which range from very basic needs to utmost volatile instincts . as a consequence , even their perceived desires / needs and the way they are expressed respond to a very wide set of stimuli , as documented in an ample literature @xcite . also , there is evidence that choices made in consumption may affect the development dynamics of the economy @xcite .",
    "we approach the problem of individual consumer s choice by describing the different phases of the informative process that leads the buyer to her final selection . in this sense , we assume that the consumer is able to build an `` experiential cognitive map '' , where all the variables are taken into account in a spatial sense .",
    "our approach basically belongs to the well - known framework of consumer decision - making research @xcite , which considers consumption as a process that generally involves the following phases : ( 1 ) problem recognition ( i.e. , market selection according to the need being satiated ) ; ( 2 ) information search ; ( 3 ) evaluation of alternatives ; ( 4 ) final choice ( i.e. , purchase ) ; ( 5 ) post - purchase evaluation .",
    "we assume that the consumer has chosen the market where to enter , and focus on phases ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 4 ) .",
    "we will neglect phase ( 5 ) .    in order to build a spatial configuration , here we use a hotelling - type approach @xcite , to qualify the satisfaction in terms of the distance from the  perfect choice \" .",
    "our model informally follows a multi - attribute approach : we assume that the consumer s exploration will reveal her behavioral attitude in recognizing and appreciating desired characteristics .",
    "thus , the set of available options is analyzed , and , after comparisons , the most satisfying alternative is chosen @xcite .",
    "market complexity affects many aspects of the decision process .",
    "in fact , motivational elements and topological configurations of attributes space unavoidably link the maximizing choice to the effort put in the search @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why our model is based on two distinct features : ( i ) the consumer s ability in discriminating similar goods , and ( ii ) her knowledge of the market structure .",
    "furthermore , a very strong influence on present choices and decisions is exerted by similar previous experiences @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", we assume that a purchase decision passes through an analysis that takes into account every cognitive element of the consumer s activity , either present or stored in memory from past experiences @xcite .",
    "the theoretical context employed here allows individuals to adaptively select strategies in order to manage the actual situation at their best @xcite @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the existence of some  safety guidelines \" to help consumers with different degrees of information to make their choices .",
    "inspired by previous studies on the beneficial role of randomness in socio - economic systems , we actually test the effectiveness of several strategies to reach a final decision , ranging from the hypothetical scenario of perfect information , to a completely random walk .",
    "as it was found for financial markets @xcite , for career advancements in managerial organizations @xcite , and for efficiency of political institutions @xcite , we anticipate that also in this case randomness gives positive results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the model , in its static and dynamic features . in section 3",
    "we run various types of simulations , and present numerical results .",
    "conclusions and future directions of research are addressed in section 4 .",
    "in this section we describe our model .",
    "we first deal with its static features , which are related to the exogenous market structure ( [ subsect : model_for_market ] ) , the endogenous consumer s characteristics ( [ subsect : model_for_consumer ] ) , and the interaction between market and consumer ( [ subsect : gravitational field ] ) .",
    "successively , we describe the dynamical procedure employed by the consumer to explore the market , gathering information in an attempt to reach her target ( [ subsect : dynamics_of_model ] ) .      the topological structure of the market is represented by a graph with three types of nodes , identified by different shapes , see figure 1(a ) .",
    "formally , the graph has the theoretic structure of a _",
    "forest _ , that is , a free union of _ trees _ ( connected acyclic graphs ) . is a pair @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a nonempty set of _ nodes _ , and @xmath2 is a ( possibly empty ) set of ( undirected ) _ edges _ , with an edge being a subset of @xmath1 having size two .",
    "two distinct nodes @xmath3 are _ adjacent _ if @xmath4 is an edge in @xmath2 .",
    "a _ path _ in a graph @xmath5 is a sequence @xmath6 of @xmath7 adjacent nodes , in the sense that the set @xmath8 is an edge in @xmath2 for each @xmath9 .",
    "a graph is _ connected _ whenever any two distinct nodes are joined by a path , and is _ acyclic _ if there are no paths beginning and ending at the same node . for further details ,",
    "refer to @xcite . ]",
    "each tree is star - shaped , and represents a `` cluster '' : for instance , the graph in figure  1(a ) has three clusters .",
    "the meaning of the three types of nodes is described below .",
    "these nodes are located at the center of the trees composing the forest , and are denoted by pentagons .",
    "they are the _ hubs _ ( i.e. , highly connected nodes ) of the graph , and may represent either a `` brand '' or a `` category '' of products .",
    "for example , in the market of cameras , we can look at each central node as a specific producer ( canon , minolta , nikon , etc . ) or as a type of camera ( bridge , mirrorless , reflex , etc . ) .",
    "these are the _ leaves _ of the forest ( i.e. , the nodes with degree 1 ) , and are denoted by circles . is the number of nodes that are adjacent to @xmath10 .",
    "the nodes adjacent to @xmath10 are also called the _ first neighbors _ of @xmath10 . ]",
    "the terminal nodes represent all final products that are sold on the specific market at hand .",
    "for instance , in dealing with the market of cellular phones , a terminal node may be a 4-tuple of the type @xmath11apple , iphone6,32,silver@xmath12 .",
    "these are the nodes that belong to paths connecting the hub of a cluster to the terminal nodes of the same cluster , and are denoted by squares .",
    "intermediate nodes represent the distinct phases of a consumer s _ informative journey _ , intended as a cognitive walk that guides her from a brand / category to a final product present in the market . to illustrate the role of intermediate nodes , consider the following example in a computer market .",
    "a consumer decides to buy a final product represented by the @xmath13-tuple    here the central node is the brand @xmath14apple@xmath15 , the terminal node is a laptop with some specified features , and the intermediate nodes are all restrictions of the @xmath13-tuple to the first @xmath16 components , apple , macbook air@xmath12 , @xmath11apple , macbook air,@xmath17@xmath12 , @xmath11apple , macbook air,@xmath17,i7 - 2.2@xmath12 , and @xmath11apple , macbook air,@xmath17,i7 - 2.2,8@xmath12 . ] with @xmath18 .",
    "thus , each product can be identified with an @xmath19-tuple of features specified by the sequence of @xmath20 informative steps needed to reach it , starting from the central node ( which represents its first feature ) . in this way , a product actually sold in the market",
    "is completely determined by the topology of the cluster ( brand / category ) to which it belongs .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in our approach the market structure is totally exogenous .",
    "therefore , at this initial stage , the distinct clusters constituting the market are not connected to each other , and live in a space that is _ not _ endowed with any metric structure .      once that both the number and the topological structure of the clusters are determined , the market has to be evaluated by consumers .",
    "in fact , each ( type of ) consumer has different features , preferences and perceptions , which constitute the `` lens '' through which the market is viewed by her .",
    "below we describe in detail how the consumer s point of view may affect the representation of the market , in terms of her : _ satisfaction _ , _ knowledge _ , and _",
    "discrimination ability_.    the presence of a personal point of view naturally induces a deformation of the graph structure , which however leaves unchanged the original topology of the market .",
    "in fact , the market assumes a shape that reflects the existence of an underlying _ satisfaction metric _ , defined in an appropriate space and intrinsic to each ( type of ) consumer : see figure 1(b ) , where , for the sake of graphical representation , we embed the graph into the two - dimensional space @xmath21 , with @xmath22 denoting the standard euclidean distance .    in order to better specify such an intrinsic satisfaction metric , we assume that each consumer has in mind an `` ideal goal '' , a hypothetical target product with several well - specified characteristics .",
    "this target , which may or may not exist in the market , occupies a specific position in the euclidean space , say , @xmath23 . in particular , if the target is a real product sold in the market , then it is located on a terminal node of the graph .",
    "a natural assumption of our model is that a consumer purchasing her ideal product @xmath24 will retrieve from it the maximum _ ex - post _ satisfaction , that is , @xmath25 . on the other hand , purchasing a product different from her target and corresponding to a terminal node @xmath26 will provide her with a non - perfect satisfaction , that is , @xmath27 in this case .",
    "note that the satisfaction @xmath28 retrieved from a non - ideal product @xmath29 shall naturally depend on the euclidean distance @xmath30 of the chosen product @xmath29 from the target @xmath24 .",
    "more generally , we define the satisfaction @xmath28 associated to any point @xmath31 by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the maximum possible distance in the bounded part of the considered space @xmath34 ( which is a square , in our case ) . due to its generality , this definition of satisfaction works for any pair of nodes ( not necessarily terminal ) .",
    "it is important to note that in our model the distance between two terminal nodes is independent from the set of features of the corresponding products .",
    "for instance , the top blue node @xmath35 and the lower red node @xmath36 in figure 1(b )  which are very far from each other in the underlying metric space  might well have very similar features ; nevertheless , it is possible that the satisfaction deriving from buying @xmath35 is very different from that deriving from buying @xmath36 , even just because they belong to different clusters . on the other hand",
    ", the three nodes of different colors placed at the center of the metric space ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath2 ) might present very different features despite being very close to each other ( hence giving a similar satisfaction to the consumer ) .    in reality ,",
    "consumers knowledge of the exogenous market structure may vary quite a lot .",
    "we measure knowledge in terms of perception of the existence of clusters ; those clusters that are known to the consumer are labeled as _ active_. figure 1(b ) graphically describes a deformed topological structure of a simple market with three clusters , as viewed by a perfectly informed consumer , i.e. , a consumer with a maximum knowledge @xmath39 . in the represented case , the three clusters are all active , in fact their central nodes are connected to each other by red edges ( whereas the _ intra - clusters _ links are colored in yellow ) .",
    "note such a perfectly informed consumer could theoretically visit all the nodes of the graph during her informative journey , using both red and yellow edges .",
    "the situation is quite different for a consumer with an imperfect knowledge @xmath40 . in figure  2",
    "we describe a market with seven clusters , as it is viewed by a consumer with a knowledge @xmath41 : in this case only three of the seven clusters are active , hence the informative journey of this type of consumer will be limited to the three corresponding brands / categories . in figure  2",
    "we also represent the following additional features :    * a possible position of the consumer at the beginning of her journey over the graph , indicated by a red human shape located on a node belonging to the top - right ( active ) cluster . in what follows",
    ", we refer to this initial node as the _ source _ of her psychological journey .",
    "( for example , in the process of searching for a new cellular phone to buy , the consumer might start her exploration from the node of the graph that represents  or is very close to  her old phone . ) * a possible position of her target product , indicated by a shape with concentric red circles . in the represented case ,",
    "the target is located on a terminal node of the middle - right ( inactive ) cluster .",
    "( however , as already emphasized , the location of the target may well fail to coincide with a terminal node of a cluster , thus indicating that the consumer s ideal product is not present in the market . )    in the described situation , despite the target coincides with a terminal node of the graph , the consumer will never be able to reach it , due to her imperfect knowledge : in fact , the target belongs to an inactive cluster .",
    "therefore , the consumer s greatest ambition can only be to get as close as possible to her target , while remaining within the subset of the market that is reachable by his partial knowledge .    ) and a quite high number of indifference levels ( @xmath42 ) , represented by annuli with different shades of gray .",
    "the indifference areas are centered at the target , which is located on a node , and is denoted by concentric red circles .",
    "the random initial position of the buyer is located on a node of the top - right cluster , and is denoted by a human shape.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the last feature that influences the market evaluation by the consumer is her preference structure . in our model , we assume that the buyer has only a sort of `` fuzzy '' perception of the level of satisfaction associated to each point of the graph , until he actually reaches a node and physically explores it . specifically , we distinguish ( 1 ) an  _ ex - ante _ perception \" , which is the individual presumption of the satisfaction that a good can provide ; and ( 2 ) an  _ ex - post _ evaluation \" , which is the satisfaction that a good existing on the market actually provides . in this respect , the level of satisfaction associated to a given node of the graph represents what we call its `` ex - ante utility '' , which is just an estimate of its `` effective utility '' ( measurable only after the consumer physically explore the node ) .",
    "we model this fuzzy preference structure by a _",
    "total preorder _ on the set of nodes . is a binary relation @xmath43 on @xmath1 , which is _ reflexive _",
    "( @xmath44 for each @xmath45 ) , _ transitive _",
    "( @xmath46 and @xmath47 imply @xmath48 for each @xmath49 ) , and _ complete _ ( @xmath46 or @xmath50 for each @xmath51 such that @xmath52 ) . in this case , the _ indifference relation _",
    "@xmath53 associated to @xmath43 , defined by @xmath54 if @xmath46 and @xmath50 , is an equivalence relation on @xmath1 . ]",
    "this is a classical hypothesis in individual preference theory .",
    "since the number of nodes is finite , the advantage of this framework is that it admits a _",
    "utility representation _ with `` thick '' indifference classes .",
    "on @xmath1 is _ representable _ if there exists an _",
    "order - embedding _ from @xmath1 into the set @xmath55 of real numbers , i.e. , a map @xmath56 such that for each @xmath3 , we have @xmath46 if and only if @xmath57 . in this case",
    ", the function @xmath58 is called a _",
    "utility representation _ of @xmath43 .",
    "it is well - known that a total preorder on a countable set ( hence , in particular , on a finite set ) is always representable : see , e.g. , @xcite for a general discussion about utility representations and some technical results . ]",
    "figure  2 provides a graphical description of such a consumer s preference structure . the @xmath34 space endowed with the satisfaction metric is partitioned into @xmath59 equivalence classes , called _ indifference levels _ and represented by concentric annuli centered at the target .",
    "all the nodes in an annulus are _ ex - ante _ equally preferred by the consumer , i.e. , they display the same _ presumed _ utility : is the total preorder on @xmath1 representing the preference structure of a consumer , @xmath53 is the indifference associated to @xmath43 , and @xmath56 is an utility representation of @xmath43 , then we have @xmath54 if and only if @xmath60 .",
    "so each annulus can be seen as a fuzzy multidimensional representation of indifference curves . ]",
    "the further from the target an annulus is , the lower the presumed utility associated to the corresponding indifference level is , and vice versa .",
    "clearly , a low value of @xmath59 is typical of a consumer with a rather low ex - ante discrimination power , whereas a large value of @xmath59 indicates a consumer with a high ability in discriminating among similar goods .    as a conclusive remark ,",
    "note that we do not assume _ a priori _ the existence of a relationship between knowledge and discrimination ability .",
    "therefore , we can identify several `` categories of buyers '' , which display various combinations of these two features . in the next subsection",
    "we illustrate how consumers interact with the market structure , and how this interaction  along with some additional individual features  determines different categories of consumers .",
    "each central node ( hub ) of the graph can be considered as a `` pole of attraction '' for the consumer . in the case that hubs represent brands , the strength of such attraction depends on many factors , such as marketing suggestions , variety of offered products , advertising and promotional campaigns , communications and brand - management policies , etc . to simplify our analysis , in this paper",
    "we assume that the attractive power of a hub is only a function of the amount of products having that brand .",
    "in fact  in analogy with the gravitational field of a body in physics  we introduce the _ mass _ @xmath61 of a hub , which is by definition equal to the number of leaves of the corresponding cluster .",
    "note that the attraction effect generated by each hub becomes effective only if the consumer is aware of the presence of the corresponding cluster : said differently , `` knowledge determines attraction '' .    in figure 3",
    "we graphically represent the _ attraction field _ induced by the three active clusters of figure 2 ( the four inactive clusters have no effect whatsoever on the consumer , since she can not even perceive their existence ) .",
    "for the sake of visualization , only the central nodes are reported in the figure .",
    "the integer number next to each hub is its mass @xmath61 , which provides a discrete measure of the strength of directional attraction .",
    "the arrows of the attraction field may possibly push the consumer to choose in a certain direction .",
    "however , not every consumer will be affected in the same way by the field : in fact , as we shall argue later on , the more a consumer is well aware of her personal tastes / goals , the less she is influenced by market suggestions . in order to take into account this kind of behavior , next we introduce the last feature that characterizes a consumer in our model .",
    "this is the capability of the consumer to discern the features of a product without being subject to the influence of the market : the higher her awareness , the less likely that she makes her choice according to the market s attraction field .",
    "in fact , a highly aware consumer will always take advantage of both her knowledge and her ex - ante discriminating power to effectively explore the market while moving towards the target . in our model",
    "we assume that awareness is a parameter @xmath62 that varies in the closed interval @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "knowledge ( @xmath64 ) , discriminating ability ( @xmath59 ) and awareness ( @xmath62 ) are the three parameters that allow us to distinguish among several categories of consumers , characterized by suitable combinations of these features . in table",
    "@xmath65 we list a taxonomy of cases , in which the extreme values of the parameters better emphasize the differences among different types of buyers .",
    "in particular , consumers from type # 1 to type # 5 ( with @xmath41 ) display an imperfect knowledge of the market , while consumers from type # 6 to type # 10 ( with @xmath66 ) know the market perfectly . within each of these two general categories",
    ", we have the extreme cases of consumers with either minimum ( @xmath67 ) or maximum ( @xmath68 ) awareness , as well as a special type of consumer who  as we shall describe later on  walks along her informative path completely _ at random_. finally , for non - random cases , we consider consumers with low and high discriminating ability ( respectively , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "these ten combinations of the main individual parameters describe a fictitious community made by several distinct ( non - interacting ) consumers , who aim at maximizing their own utility according to their subjective awareness , discrimination capacity and knowledge . as we explain in detail in the next section",
    ", each type of consumer will navigate the graph in search of her ( existing or non - existing ) target , following step by step ( i.e. , node by node ) a personal informative path starting at the source ( where she is located at time @xmath71 ) .",
    "._ten types of consumers characterized by different values of individual parameters . _",
    "only rather extreme values of knowledge ( @xmath64 ) , awareness ( @xmath62 ) and discrimination ability ( @xmath59 ) are used . the special type of random consumer also appears . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in particular ,",
    "comparing the performances of consumer @xmath72 , which is naturally the best type in both the tables , one notice that in table 4 the efficiency @xmath73 drops from @xmath74 down to @xmath75 , while the utility @xmath76 does not reach @xmath77 ( against a @xmath78 of table 2 ) ; at the same time , the social welfare passes from @xmath79 to @xmath80 , and the average stopping time increases from @xmath81 to @xmath82 time steps . on the other hand , comparing the random consumer @xmath83 in the two tables , one can see that the collapse of performance is less dramatic : this means that the random strategy confirms its superiority with respect to the completely uninformed one ( visible by comparing consumers @xmath83 and @xmath84 in table 4 ) , and seems also to be unaffected by the position of the target ( on or off product ) .    in figure 11 ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( for buyers with @xmath66 and @xmath87 ) is reported as a function of consumer awareness , as already done in figure 8 .",
    "compared with the latter , it immediately appears that the final utility trend  shown in figure 11(b )  remains almost unchanged ( it rapidly saturates to a maximum value that is just slightly lower than in the target - on - product case ) , but the shape of the efficiency behavior looks now very different : indeed , due to the impossibility to reach the target , the efficiency score never exceeds @xmath88 , staying also below the one of the random consumer for any value of awareness .",
    "thus , considering both efficiency and utility , the random consumer s performance results again quite effective , not only with respect to the totally unaware consumers , but also with respect those with @xmath89 : again , this is particularly relevant in view of the fact that gathering information has a cost , and so randomness appears even more convenient than what one can derive from the results of figure 11(b ) .    finally , let us to focus the attention on a strange effect visible in both tables 2 and 4 .",
    "some reader may have noticed that , when consumers with @xmath68 can not reach the target ( because either @xmath40 or the target is off product ) , the percentage of events with efficiency @xmath90 greater than @xmath91 seems to _ decrease _ when the discriminating ability of consumers increases ( from @xmath92 to @xmath87 ) , whereas ( as expected ) the final utility @xmath86 increases .",
    "this happens , in particular , for consumer types # 3 and # 4 in table 2 , and types # 3 , # 4 , # 8 and # 9 in table  4 .",
    "although counterintuitive at a first sight , such a behavior has a natural explanation if one deeper analyzes how the efficiency of a consumer is affected by the presence of a small number of indifference levels around the target ( which is a symptom of a low discriminating ability ) .     of table 4 )",
    "remains trapped in a cul - de - sac , yet her efficiency stays quite high.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in figure 12 we show an example of informative journey for a consumer with @xmath66 , @xmath68 and @xmath92 , in the target - off - product case ( that is , we are considering consumer # 8 of table 4 ) . due to her low discriminating ability , the buyer considers all the nodes within the first indifference level ( colored in black ) as equivalent : therefore , guided only by the degree of nodes , she wanders among the three hubs @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with only occasional raids down some branches of the respective clusters , until she finally ends up in the branch where is depicted in the figure .",
    "as one can see , she has reached ( at , say , time @xmath93 ) the product placed at the minimum possible distance from the target , and so her satisfaction  and , in turn , her utility  jumps to its ( relative ) maximum value ( see equations  ( 1 ) and  ( 2 ) ) .",
    "however , her journey is bound to end soon : in fact , due to the high number of previous visits , hub @xmath37 has been switched - off , hence the consumer s fate is to remain trapped in a cul - de - sac . in particular , she will stop , after four more steps , on node @xmath38 at time @xmath94 , thus producing an efficiency score very close to @xmath65 ( see equation ( 3 ) ) ; on the other hand , her utility score may be quite lower than @xmath65 .",
    "translated into reality , this effect captures the behavior of an undecided ( and possibly well informed ) consumer who , due to her scarce discriminating ability , oscillates for a while among different brands , and suddenly decides to buy a certain product , even if it does not perfectly matches her target .",
    "in this paper we have presented a graph - based model of consumer choice , which describes the hypothetical cognitive journey that each individual experiences in the process of buying a product .",
    "the role of the causes that influence the decision is measured by means of behavioral differentiation in several parametric simulations .",
    "our results explicitly show the relevance of information and knowledge , in the form of individual awareness , discriminating ability , and perception of market structure .    we have focused our attention on some prototypical categories of consumers , taking in account their subjectively distorted visions of the market , as it seems to happen in everyday consumption experiences .",
    "many of our results confirm what one would naturally expect : for example , a perfect knowledge of the market structure paired with a high discrimination ability and a good individual awareness usually determines a very satisfactory choice . on the other hand ,",
    "a few results of our simulations look rather surprising  and maybe intriguing  in terms of individual satisfaction , efficient strategies , and decision procedures , and therefore call for a deeper analysis of their explanation and consequences .",
    "first of all , our model shows that consumers provided with a minimal level of knowledge and information may unexpectedly reach very high levels of utility .",
    "this appears to be in sharp contrast with the classical paradigm that `` perfect information is mandatory to obtain optimal results '' . however , considered that actual markets are far from being characterized by perfect information , our results provide some justification for more realistic approaches , which do not rely on perfect information as an unquestionable tenet of optimality .",
    "second , the results of our simulations consistently suggest that whenever consumers fail to have a minimal level of knowledge and information , random decisions will make them better off .",
    "this translates into a new type of behavioral strategy , which may operate as a sort of protective shield for the unaware category of consumers .",
    "said differently , a consumer , who wants to avoid that social - economic forces  advertising , bandwagon effects , persuasive market power  may well defeat market attraction by employing a random approach , especially since the latter is free of charge .",
    "it is worth noting that a random behavioral model could be a source of inspiration for alternative strategies of both firms and policy makers , for example concerning new anti - trust and competition laws .    a last consideration arising from the results of our simulations concerns the emerging category of",
    "the `` informed - but - undecided '' consumer .",
    "in fact , for this peculiar type of buyers , it turns out that the higher their discrimination ability is , the worse their efficiency in consumption becomes .",
    "this seeming counterintuitive effect has however an explanation : with a great capacity to distinguish differentiated characteristics of goods , the final efficiency can be very high just in case of few indifference levels .",
