    "a topological lattice field theory is a prescription of initial data which allows one to construct an invariant for manifolds .",
    "the machinery works like this : one starts with a triangulation of the manifold , associates a quantity to each simplex , takes an `` appropriate '' sum and shows that the result is an invariant . of course , in practice , things are a little bit more complicated .",
    "the first problem is how you decide , from combinatorial data , if two triangulations give the same manifold .",
    "this can be settled by using an alexander type theorem @xcite or pachner s theorem @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the second problem is to find an algebraic input which reflects the combinatorial equivalence between two triangulations of a manifold . in dimension two",
    "it is known that topological lattice field theories are in bijection with semisimple associative algebra @xcite . for three dimensional manifolds",
    ", invariants can be obtained from various algebraic structures : hopf algebras in @xcite and @xcite , 6-j symbols in @xcite and @xcite or finite groups and 3-cocycles in @xcite .",
    "a review of these results and an example in dimension four can be found in @xcite .",
    "3-algebras were introduced by lawrence in @xcite as another possible approach to the problem .",
    "a 3-algebra is a vector space @xmath5 together with three maps @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 which satisfy certain compatibilities .",
    "geometrically @xmath12 represents the projection of three faces of a tetrahedron to the fourth face , @xmath13 is the projection from two faces of a tetrahedron to the the other two and @xmath14 in the rotation of a face with an angle of @xmath15 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the 6-j symbol invariant @xcite , fits naturally in the context of 3-algebras .",
    "the first result about 3-algebras is a coherence type theorem which says that in a 3-algebra a product does not depend on the way we make the evaluation .",
    "this is the analog of the fact that in an associative algebra the product does not depend on the way we put the parenthesis .",
    "the idea behind 2-groups can be traced back to @xcite where crossed modules where introduced in connection with the homotopy groups of a topological space .",
    "formally , a 2-group is a 2-category with one object in which every 1(2)-morphism is invertible . to a topological space @xmath1",
    "we can associate a 2-group by taking as 2-morphism maps from the 2-cube @xmath16\\times [ 0,1]$ ] to @xmath1 .",
    "the horizontal and the vertical composition are obtained by gluing horizontal and respectively , vertical two such morphisms .",
    "it can be shown that this 2-group is determined by the action of @xmath6 on @xmath7 and a cohomology class @xmath17 .",
    "for an up to date description of the subject see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we define strong 3-algebras .",
    "these are some particular types of 3-algebras , with @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a linear map .",
    "the advantage of working with strong 3-algebras is that the relations among @xmath14 , @xmath20 and @xmath12 are much simpler .",
    "moreover the examples in @xcite are strong 3-algebras .",
    "the set theoretical equivalent for 3-algebras is the notion of a @xmath0-group .",
    "we give a construction which associates to a manifold @xmath1 a @xmath0-group @xmath2 .",
    "this generalization is in the spirit of the definition for the fundamental group @xmath6 .",
    "the idea is to replace paths between based points with 2-paths between `` based curves '' ( in other words , equivalences classes of maps from a 2-simplex to @xmath1 which restricted to boundary are certain fixed curves ) .",
    "we show that every finite @xmath0-group give rise to a strong 3-algebra .",
    "we study a certain class of @xmath0-groups associated to a @xmath4 module @xmath5 and show that they are classified by the symmetric cohomology @xmath21 .",
    "in particular we associate to every manifold an element in @xmath22 .    in the last section",
    "we define the symmetric cohomology @xmath3 . for this",
    "we give an action of the symmetric group @xmath23 on @xmath24 and show that it is compatible with the usual differential .",
    "this is similar with way one defines the cyclic cohomology for algebras ( of course in that case one uses the action of the cyclic group @xmath25 ) .",
    "the problems we study in this paper can be broadly classified as belonging to the field of `` 2-algebra '' . namely we look to maps between morphisms .",
    "our approach is different then the classical one in looking to 2-simplexes rather then 2-cubes .",
    "this makes it more natural to talk about tri - products than vertical and horizontal compositions .",
    "it also allows us to point out a certain symmetry that is overlooked by the definition of 2-groups .",
    "in this section we recall a few definitions and results about 3-algebras . for more details",
    "we refer to @xcite . in what follows @xmath26",
    "is a field , @xmath27 means @xmath28 .",

    "the geometric pictures for @xmath12 and @xmath13 are figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig22 ] respectively .",
    "a product in a 3-algebra is a labeled triangulation @xmath45 of a triangle @xmath46 .",
