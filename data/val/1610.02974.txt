    "in recent years there has been increasing interest in the development of nanoscale devices that are able to convert heat into electricity.@xcite the functionality of such devices generally depends on the combined transport of charge and heat through quantum systems coupled to macroscopic reservoirs .",
    "various layouts for such heat engines have been discussed , most of them based on quantum dots.@xcite in particular , for the heat engine proposed in ref .",

    "electrons from the left lead can move into the cavity by tunneling through the first quantum dot , and from there into the right lead via the second quantum dot .",
    "a particle current flowing from the left lead into the cavity is achieved by shifting the energy level of the connecting quantum dot downwards such that the thermal occupation ( fermi function ) close to the level position is higher on the left side due to the temperature difference . shifting the energy level of the second quantum dot upwards by the same amount yields an equal current from the cavity into the right lead , such that the net charge current into the cavity vanishes . on the other hand , due to the temperature difference",
    "there is a positive heat current from the cavity into the leads ; therefore , in order to achieve a stationary state , a constant supply of heat into the cavity is required to compensate the loss .",
    "connecting left and right leads by an external load allows to extract electrical power @xmath2 from the engine , where the voltage @xmath3 adjusts itself according to the resistance of the load .     and",
    "charge currents @xmath4 is indicated by arrows , and @xmath3 is the generated voltage at an external load .",

    "coherent tunneling from the left to the right lead via the cavity is therefore explicitly excluded .",
    "this assumption has the technical advantage that the three - terminal problem of fig .",
    "1 can be treated as two effectively independent two - terminal systems , tunneling from l to c and tunneling from c to r , respectively .",
    "however , one may ask the question whether this assumption is essential for the proper functionality of the heat engine , and what happens if the setup of the engine is modified such that coherent tunneling from the left to the right lead is enabled . in sec .",
    "[ sec_coh_vs_incoh ] we will address this question by considering two non - interacting tight - binding models that represent the two aforementioned cases .",

    "the factor @xmath16 is due to the spin , and @xmath5 denotes the charge of an electron . besides the parameters temperature and voltage entering the fermi functions , both currents depend only on the transmission function @xmath17 .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask , which is the optimal transmission function , based on certain criteria for the engine s performance , e.g.  efficiency at maximum power .",
    "from the properties of the landauer integrals ( [ landauer_charge ] ) and ( [ landauer_heat ] ) it has been argued @xcite that the optimal transmission function is rectangular - shaped with @xmath18 inside a certain energy window , and zero outside .",

    "obviously , the performance of the heat engine can significantly be improved by replacing the single quantum dots by more appropriate multi - dot structures .",
    "even the homogeneous chain of @xmath161 dots , which is the worst among the multi - dot structures , yields an optimal @xmath163 more than twice as large as of the single dot .",
    "also the efficiency at the optimum of @xmath163 is approximately doubled .",
    "the performance of the heat engine can be further improved using more dots @xmath164 or one of the more complex structures , but the additional gain is less striking .",
    "to summarize , we have analyzed two modifications of the quantum dot heat engine proposed in ref .  .",
    "first , we have investigated a tight - binding model representing a setup where coherent tunneling between the leads is possible , without intermediate thermalization , in contrast to the original proposal .",
    "the performance parameters , i.e. , maximum power and efficiency at maximum power , turned out to be very similar in both cases , with minor advantages of the coherent setup .",
    "the explanation for this finding is that in order to achieve optimum performance the energy levels of the quantum dots that serve as energy filters have to be shifted in opposite directions such that coherent transmission through both of them is strongly suppressed and can thus be omitted from the beginning .",
    "the second issue we have dealt with is the optimization of the heat engine by chosing arrays of tunnel - coupled quantum dots with more efficient transmission functions than single quantum dots .",
    "although the theoretically ideal rectangular transmission function can not be implemented using a finite number of quantum dots , we have shown that even arrays made of very few ( e.g. five ) quantum dots are sufficient to improve both the maximum power and the efficiency at maximum power by a factor of two .",
    "we have derived simple analytical expressions for the transmission functions of homogeneous linear arrays and rings of arbitrary size , and determined the hopping parameters for inhomogeneous linear chains such that the oscillations of @xmath17 are completely suppressed .",
    "the design of customized arrays of quantum dots with predefined transmission properties can be regarded as an inverse scattering problem .",
    "in contrast to the continuum inverse scattering problem where the potential leading to the observed differential cross section has to be determined , here , one has to fix the hopping parameters , i.e. , nonlocal potentials that yield the desired transmission function .",
    "it is to be expected , that theoretical methods for the solution of this kind of inverse scattering problems will be of growing interest with the development of future nanoscale devices , not only for energy harvesting .",
    "finally , one has to keep in mind that in our approach we have completely neglected correlations , i.e. , the coulomb interaction among electrons , both within the dots and between neighboring dots . in the limit of weak correlations it is possible to retain the landauer picture of noninteracting particles by using decoupling schemes like the hartree @xcite or the hartree - fock@xcite approximation .",
    "for strongly correlated electrons , however , these approximations are clearly insufficient and one has either to resort to purely numerical methods or to use more sophisticated analytical approaches based on the meir - wingreen formalism.@xcite        y. dubi and m. di ventra , rev .",

    "<S> we consider two modifications of a recently proposed three - terminal quantum dot heat engine . </S>",
    "<S> first , we investigate the necessity of the thermalization assumption , namely that electrons are always thermalized by inelastic processes when traveling across the cavity where the heat is supplied . </S>",
    "<S> second , we analyze various arrangements of tunneling - coupled quantum dots in order to implement a transmission function that is superior to the lorentzian transmission function of a single quantum dot . we show that the maximum power of the heat engine can be improved by about a factor of two , even for a small number of dots , by choosing an optimal structure . </S>"
