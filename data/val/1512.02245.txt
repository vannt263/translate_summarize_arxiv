    "determining accurately the motion of the m31 system with respect to the milky way is fundamental for constraining the mass , dynamical history and the future evolution of the local group ( lg ) .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity of m31 was measured for the first time even before it became clear that the andromeda nebula was a galaxy @xcite , and it was then already shown to be moving towards the milky way .",
    "ever since , measuring its proper motion or transverse velocity has proven to be much more complicated , and more than a hundred years after this first line - of - sight velocity measurement , the transverse velocity remains hard to constrain reliably .    in this respect ,",
    "a first giant leap was made by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter vdmg08 ) who used the line - of - sight kinematics of m31 satellites as a probe of the global transverse velocity of the m31 system .",
    "the key assumption in this work was that the satellites of m31 on average follow the motion of m31 through space .",
    "the heliocentric distances to the m31 satellites were nevertheless not used in that study .",
    "this yielded a median transverse velocity of 42 @xmath2 with a one standard deviation confidence interval @xmath5 , consistent with zero at the 1-sigma level .",
    "ideally , one would use direct proper motion measurements , based on well - defined point - sources such as water masers whose position with respect to background sources can be measured very accurately .",
    "this approach has been used with radio interferometry to measure the proper motion of m33 @xcite and that of ic10 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , most local group galaxies do not contain known masers , and it was only recently that five masers were discovered in m31 @xcite .",
    "to date , no proper motion for m31 has been published based on these masers , which are located along the star - forming ring . in any case ,",
    "when such measurements become available , it will be necessary to properly model the annular structure of the star - forming ring , to link the kinematics of the masers to that of the galaxy as a whole .",
    "the proper motion of m31 itself was measured for the first time by @xcite with hubble space telescope ( hst ) data with 57 year time baselines in three fields , using compact galaxies as background reference objects .",
    "the surprising result of this study was that the transverse velocity was found to be 17 @xmath1 17 @xmath2 , consistent with a purely radial orbit @xcite .",
    "while being an extremely impressive technical tour - de - force , the @xcite study had to make several assumptions that could have led to a biassed result .",
    "the three fields probed in that contribution possess stellar populations with very different kinematics : primarily the extended m31 disk , their so - called `` disk '' field , the stellar halo in their `` spheroid '' field , and the giant stellar stream in their `` stream '' field .",
    "@xcite modelled the kinematic behaviour of these components to access the underlying m31 transverse motion .",
    "however , it is clear that the kinematics of these populations are currently not fully understood , and this introduces significant model - dependent uncertainties into their result .",
    "their final proper motion value is derived from a weighted average of the data in all three fields , but given the uncertainties , it is the `` spheroid '' field that contributes most significantly to that final value .",
    "inspection of star - counts maps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that the `` spheroid '' field lies at the edge of an inner shell - like structure , where several kinematic substructures have been identified @xcite .",
    "if the field contains a substantial fraction of stars that do not belong to the spheroid ( which is assumed to share the average motion of m31 ) , this could seriously affect any derived proper motion measurement .",
    "further concerns include colour - dependent point spread function differences between the reference population and the stars of interest , and the variation and degradation of the hst cameras over time .    the astrophysical implications of this measurement are immense , so we judged it to be important to undertake a completely independent estimate of the m31 transverse motion using a different method to @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since we are primarily interested in recovering the past history of the local group , we desire to uncover the motion of the _ m31 system of galaxies _ rather that just the motion of m31 itself .",
    "after all , the disk galaxy may itself be moving in an orbit within the larger structure .",
    "given that a large number of new m31 satellite galaxies were discovered as part of the pandas survey @xcite , we embarked on the present project to use these halo tracers together with a new maximum likelihood method to probe the transverse motion of the m31 system .    in sect .  2",
    ", we describe our method in detail , and test it on cosmological simulations of local group analogs .",
    "the method is then applied to actual observations of the m31 satellite system in sect .  3 where we present our results .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "we build on the approach devised by @xcite , using precise information on the phase - space distribution of the satellite system of m31 to infer the proper motion of the host . the key ingredient which allows us to derive a precise value of the transverse velocity is the use , for the first time , of precise distances for the satellite galaxies of m31 @xcite plus a greater number satellites thanks to recent discoveries .",
    "the heliocentric velocity vector @xmath6 of each @xmath7 satellite galaxy with respect to the sun can be decomposed into @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the velocity of m31 w.r.t . the milky way , @xmath10 the peculiar velocity of the satellite in the frame of m31 , @xmath11 is the circular speed of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) at the solar position in the milky way , and @xmath12 the peculiar velocity of the sun w.r.t .",
    "we use for these values a combination of the peculiar motion derived in @xcite and of the total tangential motion from @xcite using the galactocentric distance of @xcite . the line - of - sight component of the velocity of m31",
    "is also taken from @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will use a frame centred on the sun with the @xmath13-axis pointing towards m31 , the @xmath14-axis pointing to the east , and the @xmath15-axis pointing to the north .",
    "the two unknowns we are searching for are thus @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the peculiar velocity @xmath10 of a satellite galaxy is seen as coming from the equilibrium velocity distribution around the host .",

    ".  3 .",
    "we first apply the method on the 24 isolated halos in elvis .",
    "each of the halos is  observed \" from 10 different points of view , randomly distributed on a sphere of radius 783 kpc , which corresponds to the mw - m31 distance we adopted .",
    "this gives a total of 240  observed \" systems .",
    "we place ourselves in the  observer \" frame , where the @xmath13-axis is along the line of sight , and the @xmath14 and @xmath15 axes arbitrarily chosen while respecting the orthonormality of the coordinate system . for each ",
    "observed \" halo , markov chains of @xmath36 steps are built .",

    "the observer in the simulation ( grey points ) .",
    "different limits are used for the maximum distance from the host center , @xmath39 , of the 39 satellites .",
    "the small , medium and large grey points correspond respectively to @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the virial radius of the host halo .",
    "the transverse velocity is better estimated for @xmath41 than for @xmath40 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the method needs to sample a large range of lines of sight to be effective .",
    "however , this improvement stops being useful when the satellites are too far away from the host because they are not bound to it anymore .",
    "the optimum recovery is for @xmath44 with a distribution of deviations centred on the correct value to better than 10 @xmath2 with 65 @xmath2 uncertainties in both directions .",
    "we now apply the same procedure to the 12 halo pairs of elvis .",
    "this time , the  observation \" is made from the point of view of an observer located at the centre of the other halo of the pair .",
    "this again leads to 24  observations \" of satellite systems . in figure  [ isigmavsrvirevolution2 ]",
    "the mean deviation of our recovered @xmath37 and @xmath38 with respect to the true relative velocity is plotted in red .",
    "the optimum recovery is also attained for @xmath44 , with a distribution of deviations centred on @xmath45 and @xmath46 in both directions .",
    "this slightly smaller @xmath47 than in the isolated case is probably due to the limited influence of the environment in the halo pair case .",
    "the gravitational effect of the environment is dominated by the second halo in the pair configurations , while for the isolated halos it varies from case to case .    in summary ,",
    "the performance of the proposed method is validated by these high - resolution cosmological simulations , and the associated typical error is very reasonable ( @xmath48 ) with respect to previous studies that used satellites @xcite to constrain the m31 proper motion .",

    "as explained in section  [ meth1 ] , we will work in a frame centred on the sun , with the @xmath13-axis pointing towards the centre of m31 , the @xmath14-axis pointing to the east , and the @xmath15-axis pointing to the north .    in order to further validate the method , we construct a simple three - dimensional model representing the m31 satellite system observed from a star orbiting in a neighbouring large spiral galaxy .",
    "we put 39 satellites in the mock m31 system exactly at the same position w.r.t .",
    "the host as in the observed case .",
    "the observer s galaxy is placed at a distance of 783  kpc , with the observer orbiting this galaxy at 8  kpc from its center , at a circular velocity of @xmath49 and an ( arbitrary ) peculiar velocity @xmath50 .",
    "we then impose the relative velocity between the two large galaxies to be ( i ) @xmath51 , and ( ii ) @xmath52 to check that a pure radial motion can be recovered by the method .",
    "the 39 satellites are located at the mean observed distances from the real m31 system , and a peculiar velocity is randomly drawn in 1000 models from a nfw profile with eq .",
    "[ sigma ] .",
    "first we use the same halo parameters as in the following mcmc fit , i.e. @xmath19 , @xmath53 and @xmath20 .",

    "this demonstrates that , even with a sparse spatial sampling of only 39 satellites ( with only one _ spatial _ realisation compared to the multiple realisations in elvis ) , the method recovers the true transverse velocity with no bias and a reasonable uncertainty .",

    "the uncertainties are @xmath98 larger than those obtained in section [ sec_cosmo ] , which seems reasonable given that we have forced a correlation in the data . in the direction perpendicular to the plane ( @xmath37 ) , we recover the correct velocity , yet even in the direction parallel to the edge - on plane ( @xmath38 ) , our strict selection has only a limited impact since the systematic deviation is smaller than the uncertainties .",
    "consequently , we see that even with 13 satellites in a 3d co - rotating plane , the method is robust enough to find the tangential velocity of the host halo .",
    "it was shown previously in section [ mocktest ] that the assumed velocity distribution has little impact on the obtained result even when wrong values for the velocity distribution parameters in eq .",

    "given a certain halo profile , the speed of a satellite can be too high for it to be bound to the system , namely when it exceeds the escape speed @xmath99 this can be the case for satellites that have just arrived and are passing by , or if they have undergone strong interactions involving a gravitational kick .",
    "in such a situation , the method clearly sees the given line - of - sight velocity of the satellite as an exception and attempts to minimize the deviation .",
    "previous tests on cosmological simulations have shown that this was , in principle , not a big issue , mainly because such exceptions tend to compensate each other .",
    "we nevertheless decided to make a further measurement , restricting our sample to satellites with @xmath100 following the criterion of @xcite where the escape speed is calculated for the nfw model used in the mcmc method .",
    "this criterion limits our sample to 30 satellites where and xix , and xx , and xxii , and xxiv , and xxv , andxxx , pegasus , m33 , and xii and and xiv are excluded .",
    "the mock m31 model used in the previous section is used again with 30 satellites , and it is then found that the associated sparse sampling induces a systematic deviation from the true transverse velocity , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 . this is because the observational criterion to exclude galaxies depends on the line of sight , and on the actual orientation of the velocity vector of the satellite .",

    "these values are in good agreement with the values calculated with the standard likelihood formulation ( which are listed in the 3@xmath119 line of table  [ tabobservations ] ) .",
    "thus , the central values obtained both on cosmological simulations and observations are consistent , which proves that our approach is robust to the presence of outliers .",
    "nevertheless , the uncertainties are significantly larger with the `` conservative formulation '' , which is what is expected with this method @xcite , as it effectively reduces the information content of the data .",
    "the above discussion motivates us to consider the samples with 39 or 40 satellites ( i.e. the samples without object rejection ) as the preferred configurations ; the probability density functions derived from our mcmc chains from the analyses of these samples are shown in figure  [ vpdf ] .",

    "we have shown that the method we have developed allows the three - dimensional velocity of the halo to be measured accurately .",
    "our tests using the elvis suite of simulations gave rise to uncertainties on the transverse motion of less than @xmath120 , irrespective of whether the halos were isolated or in local group type pairs .",
    "the further tests , building models similar to the observations allowed us to demonstrate that the particular sky positions that the current sample of satellites are situated at , do not give rise to significant biases in the measured proper motion .",

    "in contrast , the uncertainties on the three - dimensional motion of the sun within the milky way can cause significant systematic errors .",
    "for instance , lowering the tangential motion of the observer by @xmath123 , causes the motion of the andromeda system to fall by @xmath45 .    due to their enormous masses ,",
    "the haloes of giant galaxies should dominate their environment , so we may expect it to be natural that the baryonic disk formed at the centre of this structure .",
    "this was the basis for our first set of measurements , where we analysed the motions of the 39 satellites , assuming that the radial velocity of the halo shares the radial velocity of m31 itself . in this way",
    "the motion of the system was established .    in a second set of measurements",
    ", we dropped the requirement for the radial velocity of m31 and the larger system to be identical .",
    "m31 was then considered to be just another satellite particle within this system . by analysing several selections of satellites , we are able to demonstrate the good coherence and stability of our results .    when placed into the heliocentric frame , our measurements are mostly in good agreement with the earlier study of vdmg08 , see figure  [ resultshelio ] , based on a much smaller sample of satellites . however , we are forced to draw different conclusions to vdmg08 , partially due to recent improvements in the determination of the solar motion .",
    "the remaining differences are in the measurements themselves . in figure",
    "[ resultshelio ] , the most discrepant of the measurements by vdmg08 from our results is that due to the `` outer local group galaxy sample '' , and it is this estimate that contributes most to the vdmg08 weighted average .",
    "however , their outer local group galaxy sample consists of only 5 galaxies , and given the statistical nature of their test , there are strong grounds to be concerned about the tiny sample size . while the hst measurements shown in figure  [ resultshelio ] pertain to the motion of m31 rather than that of the whole system , we note that the hst disk field measurement is completely consistent with our findings . as noted in section  [ sec : introduction ] , it is possible that the spheroid field could contain some unidentified kinematic substructure that biases that measurement , and current dynamical models of the giant stellar stream may be incomplete .",
    "another interpretation of the kinematics of the m31 satellite system is that the observed velocity gradient reflects some intrinsic rotation of the halo .",
    "this possibility was explored recently by @xcite , who found the need for a rotation of @xmath124 = ( 62 @xmath1 34 ) ( @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the projected radius from the axis of rotation .",
    "it seems difficult to disentangle such a rotation from a bulk motion such as that considered in the present contribution , as the two effects will be quite similar .",
    "however , we note that in section  [ sec_cosmo ] , we calibrated our method against cosmological simulations that do have rotation , and found no significant bias .",
    "moreover , in section [ plan ] , when we artificially imposed the presence of a plane of satellites , we found only a slight effect , contained within the range of uncertainties , on the recovered tangential velocity .",
    "the inferred transverse motion reported in this contribution turns out to be surprisingly high .",
    "the value of what we consider to be the most robust velocity measurement , corrected for the solar motion , is ( -111.5 @xmath1 70.2 , 99.4 @xmath1 60.0 , -87.5 @xmath1 13.8 ) @xmath2 , in the east , north , and radial directions , respectively . note that the radial velocity of the m31 system , determined in this way , lies within one sigma of the radial velocity of m31 corrected for the solar motion ( -103.9 @xmath1 4.0 km / s ) .",
    "this suggests that m31 does indeed share the same kinematics as the m31 system of satellites , and the dominant dark matter halo .",
    "the transverse motion of the complex turns out to be somewhat larger than the radial motion , with a value of 164.4 @xmath1 61.8 @xmath2 , i.e. a radial orbit with respect to the milky way can be rejected at @xmath127 .",
    "the direction of this motion , almost normal to the supergalactic plane ( and directed away from it ) , is in excellent agreement with the prediction of transverse motion by @xcite , based on the action principle . using the positions and redshifts of the principal galaxies out to 20  mpc",
    ", they predict the local distribution of mass and estimate the transverse velocity for a number of galaxies . according to their calculations",
    ", andromeda should have a transverse velocity of @xmath128 directed either toward or away from the supergalactic plane .",
    "given this agreement with a large transverse velocity , it will be interesting to investigate how this non - radial velocity affects the analysis of the local group mass , via the timing argument ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    over time",
    ", galaxies acquire angular momentum from the various gravitational interactions they have with their neighbouring galaxies . even if part of the torque is `` absorbed '' by the dark matter halo @xcite , some fraction is imparted onto the baryonic structures .",
    "thus , following the approach pioneered by @xcite , it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the tidal forces imparted on the local group over the course of its past evolution .",
    "these authors showed that the torque imparted on the milky way and andromeda , caused by the action of external galaxies ( within 10  mpc ) , is not negligible at @xmath34 .",
    "they estimated that the resulting transverse velocity of m31 should correspond to approximately @xmath129 . according to the uncertainties ,",
    "this value is 2-sigma lower than what we find in this study .",
    "however , it shows that a transverse velocity of m31 can be expected to arise from the tidal field that the local group is subject to .",
    "it is worth noting that the number , distances and masses of nearby galaxies have been significantly updated since that earlier work was published , which may be interesting to re - examine in the light of modern data .    the transverse motion of the m31 satellite system revealed by our study",
    "should also be placed in its context in terms of the dynamics of objects in their environment _ within _ the local group .",
    "our result is effectively a measurement relative to the motion of the milky way ( and within the uncertainties of the sun s motion ) .",
    "so the motion of the milky way is implicitly subsumed within our analysis .",
    "however , recently @xcite have suggested that the mass of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is of order 10@xmath130 m@xmath131 .",
    "the lmc appears to be on its first passage around our galaxy , on an orbit that exceeds 6  gyr , and with a radial velocity whose present magnitude exceeds @xmath132 .",
    "qualitatively , this means that if the total halo mass of the milky way lies in the vicinity of 1 @xmath133 10@xmath134 m@xmath131 , our galaxy may have accelerated up to a velocity of @xmath135 in the direction of the lmc .",
    "this back - of - the - envelope estimate is consistent with recent findings by @xcite , who estimate an upper limit of this velocity of @xmath136 . in subsequent work",
    ", it will be interesting to examine the possible effect of the lmc on our measurement of the space velocity of the m31 system .",
    "the projection onto the sky of the velocity of the m31 system that we have measured is aligned with the vector connecting m33 to m31 .",
    "this orientation may not be fortuitous given that m33 is the third most massive galaxy in the local group , and that its accretion during the formation of the m31 system may have changed the internal dynamics of the system .",
    "the proper motion of m33 has been measured by @xcite .",
    "using that proper motion study , @xcite placed constraints on the proper motion of m31 .",
    "they found an amplitude of @xmath137 , consistent with our results .",
    "in the heliocentric frame , we find @xmath138 , @xmath86 , which is not in the north - west direction excluded by @xcite . it will be interesting to re - explore this issue with orbital models of m33 within the m31 system using the kinematics that we have determined .",
    "the impact of this satellite galaxy on the andromeda system can thereby be quantified .",
    "finally , it will be very interesting to examine whether the transverse motion that we have detected calls into question whether the local group is gravitationally bound .",
    "indeed , is it instead just a `` local flyby '' ?",
    "if we consider that the andromeda system really does have the velocity that we have measured , simple orbital calculations ( integrating the equations in @xcite ) , show that the distance of closest approach between the two galaxies is @xmath139 . setting up a hydrodynamical simulation with a similar approach to @xcite",
    "would allow the exploration of the interaction , including the investigation of the intensity of tidal forces on the two galaxies .",
    "r.i . would like to thank jorge pearrubia for several very insightful conversations ."
