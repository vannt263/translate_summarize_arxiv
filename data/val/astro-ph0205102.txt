    "ce gru ( also known as grus v-1 and hawkins v-1 ) was discovered by hawkins ( 1981 , 1983 ) during a search for variable objects using uk schmidt plates .",
    "further observations by tuohy et al ( 1988 ) confirmed its binary nature ( an orbital period of 108.5 mins ) while cropper et al ( 1990 ) found strong circular polarisation ",
    "a characteristic of the polar ( or am her ) class of cataclysmic variable .",
    "these objects are interacting binaries in which material flows from a dwarf main sequence star onto a magnetic ( @xmath210200 mg ) white dwarf .",
    "this strong magnetic field is high enough to force the spin of the white dwarf to be synchronised with the binary orbital period .",
    "tuohy et al ( 1988 ) demonstrated that there are two accretion poles which are characterised by different emission properties : one pole which is always in view and is stronger in blue light , while the other pole which is visible for only @xmath00.35 of the white dwarf spin period is stronger in red light .",
    "cropper et al ( 1990 ) showed that the pole always in view was positively circularly polarised , with the other being negatively polarised .",
    "the uk schmidt plates show that ce gru exhibits two distinct levels of brightness , ( @xmath218 and @xmath221 ) . in the fainter state",
    "the accretion flow is much reduced , or stopped altogether .",
    "this may be the reason why ce gru was not detected during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( verbunt et al 1997 ) .",
    "indeed , ce gru has never before been detected in x - rays . in this paper",
    ", we report the first x - ray detection of ce gru which were made as part of a survey of polars using _ xmm - newton_.",
    "the satellite _ xmm - newton _ was launched in dec 1999 by the european space agency .",
    "it has the largest effective area of any x - ray satellite and also has a 30 cm optical / uv telescope ( the optical monitor , om : mason et al 2001 ) allowing simultaneous x - ray and optical / uv coverage .",
    "ce gru was observed using _ xmm - newton _ on 2001 oct 31 .",
    "the epic instruments ( imaging detectors covering the energy range 0.110kev with moderate spectra resolution ) were operated in full frame mode ( the count rate was not high enough to cause pile - up problems ) .",
    "the rgs detectors ( high resolution spectrographs operating in the 0.32.0kev range : den herder et al 2001 ) were configured in the standard spectroscopy mode .",
    "we clearly detect ce gru in the x - ray band .",
    "om data were taken in two uv filters ( uvw1 : 24003400  , uvw2 : 18002400  ) and one optical band ( @xmath3 band ) . the observation log is shown in table [ log ] .",
    "the data were processed using the _ xmm - newton _ _ science analysis software _ v5.2 .",
    "the rgs spectra were of low signal to noise and showed no evidence for significant line emission : we do not consider them further . for the epic pn detector ( strder et al 2001 ) , data were extracted using an aperture of 40@xmath4 arc sec centered on the source .",
    "background data were extracted from a source free region . for the epic mos detectors ( turner et al 2001 ) we extracted data in a similar way , but extracted the background from an annulus around the source .",
    "the background data were scaled and subtracted from the source data . in extracting the epic pn spectrum",
    ", we used only single pixel events and used the response file epn_ff20_sy9_thin.rmf . in the case of the mos data we used the response files m[1 - 2]_thin1v9q19t5r5_all_15.rsp",
    "the om data were analysed in a similar way using omichain and omfchain ( this latter task was not incorporated in sas v5.2 but will be in a later version ) .",
    "data were background subtracted and corrected for coincidence losses ( mason et al 2001 ) .",
    "the optical monitor data shows that ce gru had a mean brightness of @xmath3=17.9 and a maximum @xmath3=17.5 . since the @xmath3 band observations started at the descent from maximum its likely that its true maximum was brighter than this . assuming a similar colour to that found by tuohy et al ( 1988 ) ( @xmath5=0.53 ) this places ce gru in a high accretion state at the time of the _ xmm - newton _ observations and a similar brightness to observed by tuohy et al ( @xmath618 ) .",
    "the length of the observation in the epic mos detectors covered just over 1 orbital cycle .",
    "the flux in the uv filters corresponds to : uvw1 @xmath7 ergs s@xmath8 @xmath9 , uvw2 @xmath10 ergs s@xmath8 @xmath9 , ( based on om observations of isolated white dwarfs ) .",
    "the mean flux in the @xmath3 filter corresponds to @xmath11 ergs s@xmath8 @xmath9  at 5000  .",
    ".the log of _ xmm - newton _ observations of ce gru . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( 16,12 ) ( 0,12.8 )    ( 8.,13.2 )    ( -0.9,6.5 )    ( 7.7,6.6 )      in the bright phase the hard x - ray bolometric luminosity is @xmath12 ergs s@xmath8 @xmath13 . to place a very crude estimate on the distance to ce gru we compare this luminosity to the hard x - ray luminosity of am her ( whose distance is reasonably well determined ) .",
    "ishida et al ( 1997 ) observed am her using _ asca _ when it was in a high accretion state and find @xmath14 ergs s@xmath8using a distance of 75 pc .",
    "we find that ce gru would have to lie @xmath0400 pc distance to equal the @xmath15 found for am her .",
    "although ce gru was detected in x - rays for the first time and was clearly in a high accretion state , no distinct soft x - ray component was observed . on the face of it , this is surprising since a strong soft x - ray flux has long been considered one of the defining properties of polars .",
    "observations of polars using _ exosat _ ( eg osborne 1988 ) and _ rosat _ ( eg ramsay et al 1994 ) found a strong distinct soft x - ray component , and in general , the ratio @xmath16 .",
    "further , the ratio was correlated with the magnetic field strength of the white dwarf : a high field gave a high ratio . to account for the large ` soft x - ray excess ' seen in many polars , dense ` blobs ' of material which do not form a shock and radiate in soft x - rays were proposed ( kuijpers & pringle 1982 , frank , king & lasota 1988 ) .",
    "currently , four polars have been observed using _ xmm - newton_. of those systems observed in an intermediate or high accretion state , ww hor showed no distinct soft x - ray component ( ramsay et al 2001 ) while by cam has one pole which did show such a component and one which did not ( ramsay & cropper 2002 ) .",
    "indeed only one other system , dp leo , has shown a distinct soft x - ray component ( ramsay et al 2001 ) .",
    "even for those polars which showed the lowest ratios using _ rosat _ ( ef eri and am her ) a distinct soft x - ray component was still observed .",
    "a variation of the standard shock model has been proposed by heise & verbunt ( 1988 ) and gnsicke , beuermann & de martino ( 1995 ) who suggest that the reprocessed x - ray component lies in the euv band while the strong soft x - ray component seen in many polars originates from dense ` blobs ' of material which do not form an exposed shock .",
    "our data are consistent with this view if the temperature of the reprocessed component is @xmath17ev : below 2ev the flux of the reprocessed component is too small , while above 5ev it would be too high .",
    "a component with a temperature above 10ev would be evident in the spectrum ( figure  [ bb ] ) .",
    "the implication in this case is that the fraction of blobby accretion is small in ce gru .",
    "again this is consistent with the unfolded light curves ( not shown ) which do not show strong flaring seen in many systems ( such as by cam ",
    "ramsay & cropper 2002 ) .",
    "the amount of irradiation that the white dwarf receives is a function of height in the post - shock region , with greater temperatures from higher up , but more overall flux ( even at higher energies ) from near the base ( cropper , wu & ramsay 2000 ) . on the other hand , because of the curved surface of the white dwarf , the illumination is decreasing , with slightly more than the square of the distance from the axis of the post - shock region .",
    "further , albedo varies as a function of temperature . although the effects of irradiating a white dwarf atmosphere have been explored to some extent ( williams",
    "et al 1987 , heise 1995 ) , this is an area which needs further work to determine how the temperature of the reprocessed spectrum is effected by parameters such as the accretion rate and magnetic field .",
    "we note , however , that higher specific accretion rates result in lower shock heights , and higher magnetic fields also reduce the height of the post - shock region ( see for example cropper et al 1999 ) , so the solid angle of emission from the post - shock flow intercepted by the white dwarf photosphere is increased . in these high - state data of ce gru , we have no reason to expect anomalously low specific accretion rates , and ce gru has a magnetic field strength typical of polars .",
    "therefore there is no obvious reason for the reprocessed component to have moved into the euv if it is normally in the soft x - ray band in polars .",
    "this gives support to the heise & verbunt ( 1988 ) suggestion that the soft x - ray component is indeed caused by blobby accretion .",
    "some factor(s ) must determine the number , length and density of blobs .",
    "obvious parameters include the magnetic field strength and orientation of the white dwarf , the orbital period and the mass transfer rate .",
    "ramsay et al ( 1994 ) identified the magnetic field strength as one important parameter .",
    "further progress in this regard awaits a systematic analysis of the strength of the soft x - ray component as a function of these parameters in a sufficiently large sample of polars .",
