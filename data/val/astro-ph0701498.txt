    "in a recent companion paper [ 1 ] the notion of galactic basin was adopted in order to investigate some properties of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "this concept , introduced in a previous work [ 2 ] , is extensively utilized in this study .",
    "the concept of galactic basin is similar to that of a terrestrial basin , peculiar of a river , with all the @xmath10 inherent to any analogy .",
    "when the position of an instrument recording the passage of cosmic ions and the source distribution in the disk are assigned , the galactic basin is simply that particular region populated by the majority of the sources feeding the instrument .",
    "changing the position of the instrument , the characteristics of the @xmath11 ( volume , extension , shape , contour , etc ) are altered . in our opinion , the concept of galactic basin is simple and straightforward , and particularly useful when an efficient tool is required to compare , investigate or even discover some properties of cosmic ions .",
    "the purpose of this study is to identify those physical phenomena at the origin of the @xmath0 and to give a quantitative account of the major characteristics of the helium and iron @xmath3 .",
    "their explanation is a part of a research effort to account for the knees and ankles of individual ions .",
    "the origin of the @xmath3 presented here are conclusively corroborated in a forthcoming , collateral paper [ 3 ] demonstrating the interconnection between the @xmath3 and @xmath12 of individual ions of the cosmic - ray spectrum .",
    "the results and the prerequisites of this investigation are organized as follows . in the second section the hypotheses and the parameters involved in the calculation",
    "are enumerated . since they have been presented in previous studies [ 4,5,6 ] ,",
    "their description is concise . only for two upgrades of the simulation code ( @xmath13 ) ,",
    "the description is ampler ; these upgrades are introduced here for the first time .",
    "they regard the galactic wind and the propagation of the particles at energies greater than @xmath14 @xmath15 , the previous limit in the maximum energy of @xmath13 . in section 3 the properties of galactic basins of helium and iron , in the interval @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath15 ,",
    "are summarized and discussed . through many examples",
    ", it is investigated how the shape of basins change with increasing energy . in section 4",
    "are clarified and consolidated some results given in section 2 . in section 5",
    "it is investigated in detail how nuclear cross sections affect the change of the spectral index of individual ions .",
    "the interaction cross sections of helium and iron with the insterstellar matter are set artificially constant .",
    "then the differential energy spectrum of helium and iron is studied by counting the number of cosmic rays intercepting the local galactic zone . in section 6",
    "the influence of the magnetic field and the galactic wind on the results previously obtained is calculated and discussed . in section 7 a comparison of the predicted and measured energy spectra of helium and iron is presented . unfortunately , even a concise comparison ( to preserve a tolerable length of the paper ) with the experimental data necessitates logical and theoretical prerequisites , partially presented in section 7 , partially described elsewhere [ 7,8 ] .",
    "protons are not included in this analysis , in spite of their importance , because , at very high energy , computational procedures become quite complex and very time consuming .",
    "primary protons interacting with the interstellar hydrogen yield many secondaries , indistinguishable from primaries , which make the analysis of the results quite involved as reported in a previous study limited to the energy of @xmath16 @xmath2 [ 4 ] .",
    "the present calculation deals only with helium and iron because the behavior of all other ions lighter than iron , except protons , fall between these two nuclei , as previously demonstrated [ 1 ] .",
    "the energy interval considered extends from @xmath4 to @xmath5 @xmath15 , which is adequate for the @xmath0 problem .",
    "in the following the set of parameters utilized in the calculation are concisely presented .",
    "the form and dimensions of the galaxy are displayed in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig1 ] .",
    "a cylindrical frame of reference is used with coordinates @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the bulge is an ellipsoid with a major axis of @xmath21 @xmath22 , lying onto the galactic midplane , and a transverse minor axis of 6 @xmath22 .",
    "the disk has a radius of @xmath23 @xmath22 and a half thickness of @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "the interstellar matter consists of pure hydrogen with constant density of 1 atom @xmath26 @xmath27 [ 9 ] enhanced to 1.24 to take into account heavier nuclei .",
    "the galactic magnetic field is a superposition of regular and chaotic fields . in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig3 ] are shown the line pattern of the spiral field and the principal field line ( thick line ) which intercepts the earth at coordinates @xmath18=8.5 @xmath22 , @xmath19=@xmath28 @xmath22 and @xmath20=@xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "the field strength of the regular component is shown in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the coherence length of the regular field is @xmath31 @xmath25 [ 12 ] .",
    "the chaotic field is materialized by magnetic cloudlets [ see , for example , references 10,11 ] of spherical form with a mean radius of 2.5 @xmath22 fluctuated by a uniform distribution with a width of @xmath32 @xmath25 .",
    "the ion propagation normal to the regular spiral field is generated by the chaotic field leading to a transverse - to - longitudinal displacement ratio of 0.031 , in a range compatible with the quasi - linear theory of ion propagation in an astrophysical environment [ 13 ] .",
    "the source distribution , @xmath33 , regarded as uniform , is the following : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a normalization constant , @xmath36 is the radial distribution with a disk radius @xmath37 = @xmath23 @xmath22 and n(@xmath38,@xmath19 ) is the vertical distribution with a gaussian shape with standard deviation @xmath38 = @xmath39 @xmath25 . the function n(@xmath38,@xmath19 ) makes smooth the source distribution along @xmath19 with respect to a steep , unphysical , @xmath19-rectangular distribution .",
    "the function @xmath33 is not dissimilar to the positions of the galactic sources distributed as supernovae remnants [ 14,15 ] with the advantage of avoiding a specific , constraining hypothesis on source positions . replacing n(@xmath38,@xmath19 ) by @xmath40 in equation ( 1 ) , a strictly uniform distribution is obtained where @xmath41 is the disk half thickness .",
    "the mean distance of the source positions from the local zone is denoted by @xmath42 .    the flattening of the electron spectrum in external galaxies , detected by radiotelescopes at frequencies about 1 ghz , is commonly regarded as observational evidence for the existence of the galactic winds [ 16 ] .",
    "this evidence is less convincing in the milky way because , the synchrotron radiation detection and analysis of the results are quite complex , being the earth embedded in the galaxy .",
    "a three dimensional formula , based on observational data , for the galactic wind in the disk and halo volume , is not known .",
    "usually , a one dimensional wind along @xmath19 with a linear velocity is considered in many investigastions of cosmic rays , though a radial wind component is not excluded [ 17 ] . from these inputs",
    "it seems appropriate for this calculation a linear formula of the type : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a suitable constant constrained by the maximum wind velocity , @xmath45 , at the disk boundaries",
    ". simulation algorithms shift along @xmath19 the trajectory segments by the amount @xmath46 according to the equation ( 2 ) , namely , @xmath46",
    "= @xmath47(@xmath19)@xmath48 where @xmath48 is the time interval taken by the cosmic ion to travel the length @xmath49 of the trajectory segment along @xmath19 .",
    "the maximum wind velocities adopted in a variety of cosmic - ray investigations in the disk , span the range 5 to 40 @xmath50/@xmath51 .",
    "the account of the boron - to - carbon flux ratio at very low energy [ 18 ] probably represents an incisive example of the role of the galactic wind on cosmic rays . instead of adopting a particular value of @xmath45 , which is unnecessary in this work",
    "as it will be clear in sections 6 and 7 , the parameter @xmath44 and the related maximum wind velocity , is left as a free parameter .",
    "new algorithms have been added for the propagation of cosmic rays around the knee energy .",
    "the maximum energy of the previous version of @xmath13 was at @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "fig.@xmath17[fig : fig4 ] reports , as an example , three helical trajectories winding round the magnetic field , whose direction coincides with the segment @xmath52 , @xmath53 @xmath25 long .",
    "the radii of the three helices are 0.01 , 4 and 50 @xmath25 in a uniform field with @xmath54 @xmath55@xmath56 strength .",
    "the smallest helix is indistinguishable with the line segment @xmath52 , indicative of the fundamental , standard condition of cosmic ions in the galaxy at energies below @xmath57 @xmath15 ; while travelling in the galaxy they are mainly bound to the lines of the regular field .",
    "details of the propagation procedure at very high energy are given in the appendix @xmath58 .",
    "particles which enter the halo are regarded as lost , since the albedo is less than 2 per cent at the energy of @xmath16 @xmath2[1 ] and decreases with the energy .",
    "either a circular or a spiral field can be used in the halo with appropriate strength ( see equation ( 3 ) of ref.[1 ] ) .",
    "matter density in the halo is a factor @xmath59-@xmath60 less than that in the disk . in the present investigation ,",
    "however , the influence of the halo and its size , is quite marginal .",
    "in this section the major characteristics of the galactic basins are summarized .",
    "note that the total length of the principal magnetic field line from the bulge ( @xmath18 = 4 @xmath22 ) to the disk radius ( @xmath18 = 15 @xmath22 ) is 43.5 @xmath22 .    in fig.@xmath17[fig :",
    "fig5 ] are shown the positions of the helium sources having trajectories intercepting the local galactic zone at sixteen different energies ( from @xmath4 to @xmath61 @xmath15 ) .",
    "the source positions are projected onto the galactic midplane .",
    "the sequence of the plots highlights the changes of the source distributions with increasing energy .",
    "the corresponding spatial distributions of the iron sources ( not shown ) have similar structure , though the values of the parameters characterizing the basins are , of course , different .",
    "source positions populate a narrow strip , along the principal magnetic field line , except at the maximum energy of @xmath62 @xmath15 where the basin form is radically different from the previous ones .",
    "this fundamental feature was identified at low energy below @xmath16 @xmath15 , long time ago by ourselves , for proton and beryllium ions , and recently for all other ions from helium to iron [ 1 ] .",
    "these characteristics of the ion basins derive , ultimately , from observational data of the milky way , and particularly , from the spiral shape of the magnetic field shown in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig2 ] . as a general rule ,",
    "spiral galaxies possess a regular magnetic field with a spiral shape , andromeda being a notable exception with an annular field .",
    "this feature , together with the small ratio of transverse - to - longitudinal ion propagation , yields long and narrow basins .",
    "fig.@xmath17[fig : fig6 ] displays a tridimensional view onto the galactic midplane of the positions of helium and iron sources emanating trajectories which intercept the local galactic zone in a reference frame where the horizontal axis is the principal field line .",
    "this coordinate system and its advantages are described in appendix a. each plot contains samples of @xmath63 ion trajectories . to illustrate the basin profiles two arbitrary energies of @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xmath15",
    "are chosen . at the energy of @xmath64 @xmath15 both basins",
    "are well contained in the disk , the iron basin being more concentrated around the local zone because its trajectory lengths are shorter than those of helium . at the energy of @xmath66 @xmath15 both basins increasingly populate a zone toward the bulge frontier .",
    "note that in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig6 ] the bulge lies at coordinate @xmath67 @xmath22 along the principal field line , ( i.e. the axis of the figure ) while the disk edge at @xmath68 @xmath22 .",
    "the spatial distribution of the sources in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig6 ] can be visualized by contour plots containing @xmath69 of the sources .",
    "the arbitrary value of this percentage was previously adopted ( see figure 5 of reference [ 1 ] ) .",
    "fig.@xmath17[fig : fig7 ] shows the contours of two iron basins at the energies of @xmath4 and @xmath65 @xmath15 .",
    "the lower and upper solid lines in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig7 ] delimit , respectively , the bulge and the disk internal frontiers . in order to better emphasize the transversal structure of the basin , the horizontal axis in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig7 ]",
    "is magnified by a factor 50 .",
    "it is evident that the basin shape changes from an ovoidal form , typical at low energy , to a ram head , typical at high energy .",
    "these alterations of the basin shape suggest that cosmic - ray populations suffer difforming filtering and processing as the energy varies .",
    "it is apparent , for example , the basin enlargement with increasing energy . the supposed continuity between the two contour plots in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig7 ] ,",
    "passing from a narrow , ovoidal shape to a large ram - head shape , manifests the transverse enlargement with the increasing energy .",
    "note also that the basin at @xmath4 @xmath15 is well contained in the disk , with longitudinal ends approximately equidistant from the bulge and disk frontiers . on the contrary , at the energy of @xmath65 @xmath15",
    "the longitudinal ends of the basin are not equidistant from the bulge and disk frontiers .",
    "the relative high clustering of cosmic - ion sources closer to the bulge frontier ( @xmath18 = 4 @xmath22 ) is due to the magnetic field strength , quite large in this zone ( @xmath70@xmath56 ) compared to the strength ( @xmath71@xmath56 ) around the disk edge ( @xmath18 = 15 @xmath22 ) as indicates fig.@xmath17[fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the basin extension is characterized by the length @xmath72 , along the principal field line , and the transverse width @xmath73 .",
    "the changes in the form of a basin are quantified in terms of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "fig.@xmath17[fig : fig8 ] reports @xmath72 @xmath74 energy for helium and iron .",
    "note that the extensive air shower experiments measure the total kinetic energy of the ions , therefore it is useful , here and in all subsequent plots , to adopt this unit of measurement . for both ions @xmath72 gradually decreases up to a minimum occurring , approximately , at the energy of @xmath75 @xmath2 for helium and at @xmath5 @xmath2 for iron .",
    "after the minimum , @xmath72 increases to a maximum value , 26 @xmath22 for helium and 25 @xmath22 for iron , then it decreases again .",
    "the @xmath3 of the two ions are related to the minima of @xmath72 as it will be shown later . while the decrease of @xmath72 for iron is perfectly linear in the interval @xmath76-@xmath77 @xmath15 , that of helium is slightly arc shaped",
    "; this feature is accounted for by the larger extension of helium basins compared to those of iron , which lose helium ions from the large basin periphery .",
    "the general decrease of @xmath72 with energy is due to the rising cross sections .",
    "the analysis of the structure of the maxima of @xmath72 in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig8 ] is beyond the perimeter of this paper and it will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .    for the sake of completeness let us mention that the ratio @xmath72/ @xmath73 has been also calculated as a function of the atomic weight and shows a regularity , useful in some circumstances ( see figure 5 of ref .",
    "illuminating the galaxy with an imaginary isotropic beam emitted in the local zone and counting the number of nuclear collisions occurring in the disk , the characterization of the galactic basins around the @xmath0 energies is greatly facilitated . in fact , the number of trajectories simulated by this procedure is about two orders of magnitude higher than the direct method used in sections 5 , 6 and 7 .",
    "the direct method utilizes the source positions @xmath33 , and counts the number of particles reaching the local zone , @xmath78 .",
    "the simulation algorithms reconstruct cosmic - ion trajectories originating in the disk .",
    "they are classified according to the physical process causing the ion to disappear from the disk : nuclear collisons , ionization energy losses , and escape trajectories . by escape",
    "is meant trajectories rooted in the disk but terminating into the halo .",
    "a generic sample of cosmic rays will contain the fractions of cosmic trajectories denoted respectively @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 with the obvious condition : @xmath79 + @xmath80 + @xmath81 = 1 .",
    "this partitions were adopted in all previous works made using the code @xmath13 . above @xmath16 @xmath2 ,",
    "the ionization energy loss is thoroughly negligible , hence @xmath80= @xmath28 and a simplified , useful situation appears , where @xmath79 + @xmath81 = 1 , and therefore the knowledge of @xmath79 entails that of @xmath81 .",
    "typical samples of @xmath63 trajectories for each energy have been simulated and therefore the quantity @xmath79 is simply the number of nuclear collisions in the disk divided by @xmath63 .",
    "fig.@xmath17[fig : fig9 ] gives @xmath79 as a function of the energy for helium and iron . at the energy of @xmath4 @xmath2 the fraction of nuclear collisions in the disk for helium",
    "is set arbitrarily to 1 .",
    "iron collisions are normalized accordingly .",
    "typically , for @xmath63 ion sources in the disk with an energy of @xmath57 @xmath2 there are @xmath82 collisions for helium and @xmath83 for iron ; therefore in this case , @xmath79= @xmath84 for helium and @xmath79= @xmath85 for iron , if the number of helium collisions at @xmath4 @xmath2 is @xmath86 .",
    "the helium fraction @xmath79 has a tiny rise in a large energy interval , @xmath87-@xmath88 @xmath2 , reaching a maximum of @xmath89 at @xmath90 @xmath2 ( hardly visible in the figure ) , then it falls steeply in the energy decade @xmath77-@xmath91 @xmath2 .",
    "the fall is correlated with the helium knee as it will be apparent later . the helium fraction @xmath79 increases by @xmath92 in the range @xmath4-@xmath88 @xmath2 . since @xmath38(he ) and @xmath38(fe ) increase with energy so does the number of collisions in the disk .",
    "this is obvious from the expression of the inelastic collision length , @xmath93 : @xmath94 where a is a suitable atomic weight of the interstellar medium , @xmath95 its density and @xmath96 is the avogadro number .",
    "in fact , for a constant disk thickness , a uniform matter density and a constant number of sources , a lower @xmath93 entails a higher number of collisions .",
    "the decrease of @xmath79 by @xmath97 with respect to its maximum value in the interval @xmath87-@xmath88 @xmath2 identifies ( rather arbitrarily but conveniently ) the particular energies where ion losses from the disk become dominant , since @xmath81 = @xmath98 - @xmath79 .",
    "these values are @xmath99 @xmath2 for helium and @xmath100 @xmath2 for iron .    the influence of nuclear cross sections and of the magnetic field strength on @xmath79 can be separated by setting , artificially , @xmath38(he ) and @xmath38(fe ) , at constant values .",
    "the results are shown in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig10 ] which gives @xmath79 @xmath74 energy , using constant cross sections , namely , @xmath38(he)=",
    "@xmath101 @xmath102 and @xmath38(fe)= @xmath103 @xmath102 , in the full energy range ( see also section 5 ) . in this case , unlike the results given in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig9 ] , @xmath79 is rigorously constant in the range @xmath16-@xmath104 @xmath2 , as expected .",
    "the abrupt decrease of @xmath79 with the energy manifests the inefficiency of the galactic magnetic field to retain cosmic helium , with a uniform efficiency , beyond @xmath77 @xmath2 . adopting a fictitious magnetic field with a field strength 10 times higher than that shown in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig2 ]",
    ", the thin curve @xmath44 transforms into the curve @xmath105 .",
    "the curve @xmath106 refers to a magnetic field strength attenuated by a factor 10 .",
    "the beautiful separation between the curves @xmath44 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and the ensuing shifts in the positions of the bends , along the energy axis , mark the role of the magnetic field in the origin of the @xmath3 .",
    "note that @xmath79 attains a minimum value , rather constant beyond @xmath91 @xmath2 , with a characteristic gap between the high and the low plateau , amounting to @xmath107 for helium and @xmath108 for iron , as shown in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig10 ] .",
    "the height of the gap is a peculiarity of the galaxy , the ion and the nuclear cross sections .",
    "the two minima signal the onset of the rectilinear propagation .",
    "note also the interesting phenomenon that at low energy , below @xmath109 @xmath2 and at very high energy , above @xmath91 @xmath2 , the three curves @xmath44 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 coincide . at very high energy the rectilinear propagation of cosmic ions sets on and the bending power of the magnetic field cease to be efficient , thoroughly vanishing above @xmath110 @xmath2 . at low energy below @xmath111 @xmath2 ,",
    "ions experience multiple bendings and multiple inversions of the motion , regardless of the particular energies of the ions , and the three curves coincide again .    the corresponding curves for iron show a similar behaviour , and particularly , the triple splitting of @xmath79 with the three values of magnetic field strength is observed .",
    "for the sake of completeness and subsequent convenience    in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig11 ] are given the source distributions for helium along the principal field line intercepting the earth ( see fig.@xmath17[fig : fig2 ] ) , at sixteen different energies .",
    "the transverse structure of the source positions is more evident in this frame of reference than in that used in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig5 ] , which better emphasizes the role of the regular field to channel cosmic ions .",
    "it is particularly evident the change of the source positions around the @xmath0 energy band , where basins become larger and larger ( see fig.@xmath17[fig : fig8 ] ) and devoid of sources ( the falls in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig9 ] and fig.@xmath17[fig : fig10 ] ) .",
    "the minimum of the basin length , apparent in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig8 ] , occurs at the energies between @xmath88 and @xmath112 @xmath2 .",
    "it is impressive the alterations in the source distributions around the energy of @xmath88 @xmath2/@xmath113 which signal the presence of the helium knee .",
    "the source positions in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig11 ] complements those given in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig5 ] .",
    "the results obtained in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig11 ] , interpreted as source positions and not @xmath26 @xmath114 , take advantage of the trajectory reversibility in a magnetic field .",
    "an approximate method of calculation discussed and checked previously [ 1 ] which allows to simulate a large number of trajectories .",
    "typical samples of @xmath115 cosmic rays are injected from the local galactic zone and the corresponding trajectories reconstructed through the disk volume .",
    "the coordinates of the nuclear collisions have been recorded . in this specific calculation",
    "the initial point of the trajectory is the local zone , while the final point coincides with the position of the inelastic nuclear collision . by inverting the initial and final point of the trajectory",
    "the source distribution feeding the local zone is calculated .",
    "this calculation procedure implicitly preassumes a source distribution strictly uniform in the disk and not that described by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the magnetic field and the nuclear cross sections , @xmath38 , determine the positions of the fall of @xmath78 along the energy axis i.e. the positions of the individual @xmath3 . in order to single out the effects of these two parameters ,",
    "the nuclear cross sections have been artificially set at a constant value ( 115 mb for helium and 775 mb for iron ) , above the energy of @xmath14 @xmath2 . with this artifice ,",
    "the influence of @xmath38 on the knee becomes more patent .",
    "as it is well known proton - proton and nucleus - proton cross sections increase with energy beyond @xmath116 @xmath2 , where a vague minimum occurs , up to the maximum energy reached in accelerator experiments , @xmath117 @xmath2 [ 19 ] .",
    "fig.@xmath17[fig : fig12 ] shows the rise of nuclear cross sections with energy for helium @xmath38(he ) , iron @xmath38(fe ) and proton @xmath38(p ) . as an example , at @xmath118/@xmath113 @xmath38(he ) is @xmath119 @xmath102 and @xmath38(fe ) = @xmath120 @xmath102 , while at @xmath77 @xmath2 @xmath38(he ) is @xmath121 @xmath102 and @xmath38(fe ) = @xmath122 @xmath102 .    using the spatial distribution of the sources @xmath33 and reconstructing the trajectories of cosmic ions , the number of particles intercepting the local galactic zone , @xmath78 is counted .",
    "the quantity @xmath78 is directly proportional to the differential energy spectrum of the cosmic rays , @xmath123/@xmath124 .",
    "fig.@xmath17[fig : fig13 ] gives @xmath78 for helium and iron as a function of energy .    since equal samples ( tens of millions ) of helium and iron trajectories",
    "have been simulated for the results given in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig13 ] , the powers of the sources for the two ions in the galactic disk are equal . in section 7 , in the comparison with the experimental data , this irrealistic hypothesis , though convenient here , is removed .",
    "the results in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig13 ] indicate that the iron intensity is a factor 2.93 lower than that of helium in the energy band where @xmath78 for both ions is approximately constant .",
    "it turns out that @xmath78 for helium is constant up to the energy of @xmath111 @xmath2 , then a rapid fall initiates . in the energy band",
    "@xmath125-@xmath126 @xmath2 the fall of @xmath78 exhibits a constant slope with an index of 3.27 .",
    "the same trend of @xmath78 is displayed for iron with a spectral index of 3.08 , thus the curve is unevenly shifted in energy with respect to the helium curve .",
    "the approximate constancy of @xmath78 for helium in the interval @xmath4 - @xmath127 @xmath2 suggests that the particle transport across the local zone attains somehow a stationary regime .",
    "note that the disk boundaries are sufficiently remote from the local zone so that @xmath78 remains almost unaffected .",
    "neither play a role effects related to the simulation algorithms such as the diameter of the local zone or the representation of the helices ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the particular energy of the bend in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig13 ] directly manifests the effect of the magnetic field on cosmic ions reaching the local zone , depurated from the influence of rising cross sections .",
    "the energies where the bends occur , @xmath128 @xmath2 for helium and @xmath129 @xmath2 for iron , remind of the results reported in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig8 ] regarding the lengths of the longitudinal axes of the basins , @xmath72 .",
    "a notable circumstance is that the energies characterizing the bends in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig13 ] , are the same where the minima of @xmath72 in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig8 ] occur .",
    "this is not surprising because the volume of the galactic basins , and in turn @xmath72 , is certainly interrelated to the particle intensities @xmath78 .",
    "taken this circumstance into account , the same considerations developed in sections 4 and 5 apply on the interplay of the cosmic - ion populations around the knee .",
    "for an assigned energy of the ion and @xmath38 , the positions of the bends are intimately related @xmath130 @xmath131 to the form and mean strength of the magnetic field and @xmath130 @xmath132 to the thickness of the disk . by altering one of these two parameters",
    "the bend positions critically change .",
    "thus , as an example , setting a fictitious magnetic field , 10 times higher than the real field , changes similar to those shown in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig10 ]  are calculated .",
    "using a completely different simulation code a comparable effect is observed [ 8 ] .",

    "two competing mechanisms govern the trend of @xmath78 @xmath74 energy .",

    "before facing a comparison with experimental data it is useful to further explore some characteristic features of the basins around the knee energy .",
    "basins undergo radical changes in the knee energy region and therefore those variables characterizing the basins , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath72 , @xmath42 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 should absorb somehow the upheaval .    in the following ,",
    "constant cross sections are replaced by the rising cross sections , shown in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig12 ] .",

    "these peaks are explained in the light of the results described in sections 3 and 4 and by direct analysis of the simulated trajectories .",
    "in fact , the mean distance of the sources from the local zone diminishes with the energy , as the tails of the basins gradually disappear , as apparent from fig.@xmath17[fig : fig5 ] and fig.@xmath17[fig : fig11 ] .",

    "some new distant sources add to the enlarging basin , enhancing @xmath42 , which tranlates in a bump visible in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig16 ] .",
    "the grammage is dominated by long trajectories rooted close to the local zone but slightly aside the principal field line .",
    "trajectories along the principal field line have much small lengths .",
    "long trajectories are the result of multiple inversions of motion in the magnetic field , and not of long distances between the sources and the local zone . since the energy region of the two peaks in @xmath42 corresponds to the onset of the rectilinear propagation , the expected enhancement of @xmath156 or @xmath155 ( expected only on the basis of that of @xmath42 ) does not take place .",

    "ions reaching the local zone decrease by about @xmath165 with a wind velocity of @xmath166 @xmath164/@xmath51 .",
    "the decrease is almost absent for iron .",
    "this is due to the mean length of iron trajectories , smaller than that of helium , as it is evident from equation ( 3 ) given the difference of @xmath38(he ) and @xmath38(fe ) .",
    "fig.@xmath17[fig : fig18 ] gives the grammage versus wind velocity , for the same energies of the previous figure .",

    "accordingly comparable effects are expected on the basin extensions ; they would be hardly visible in figures like fig.@xmath17[fig : fig5 ] and fig.@xmath17[fig : fig11 ] .",
    "the parameters defining the influence of the magnetic field on relevant properties of galactic cosmic rays were the first to be tested in 1995 , namely , the residence time of cosmic ions in the galaxy as a functions of the diameter of the cloudlets [ 6 ] ; later , the age and grammage of protons against the shape of the regular field ( circular , spiral , and elliptic ) were calculated [ 4 ] .",
    "the beryllium age against the shape of the regular field was also investigated [ 20 ] .",
    "the results of these calculations indicate that the magnetic field structure and the other parameters of @xmath13 conform , with the correct order of magnitude , to relevant experimental data at low energy , especially those regarding the age and grammage of cosmic ions .    the ratio of tranverse - to - longitudinal propagation , @xmath18 , in the magnetic and matter structure of the galaxy incorporated in @xmath13 is close to the theoretical value of @xmath167 - @xmath168 dictated by the quasi - linear theory of cosmic - ion propagation [ 13 ] .",
    "in fact , the algorithms have a ratio of @xmath169 obtained by dividing the diameter of the magnetic cloudlets to the coherence length of @xmath31 @xmath25 and finally averaging over the field directions ( a factor @xmath170/@xmath171 ) .",
    "the effect of this fundamental parameter on @xmath78 , e.g. the quantity directly related to the experimental data regarding the @xmath0 , has been analyzed .",
    "fig.@xmath17[fig : fig19 ] reports @xmath78 for different cloudlet diameters , corresponding to alterations of @xmath18 from @xmath169 to @xmath172 .",
    "note that at very high energy the ratio @xmath18 should necessarily increase compared to the ratio at low energy , otherwise the ion gyroradius would be inferior to the mean transverse displacement in the regular field , which is untenable .",
    "thus , small values of @xmath18 are unphysical at very high energy",
    ".    at small @xmath18 ions suffer a major effect of the regular field , being easily channeled toward the disk periphery instead of escaping along the @xmath19 direction , creating a localized depression in the curve @xmath78 versus energy .",
    "this depression not only disappears for greater ratios @xmath18 , as apparent from fig.@xmath17[fig : fig19 ] , but an opposite phenomenon emerges , consisting in a small enhancement of @xmath78 above @xmath173 @xmath2 .",
    "this is due to the fragile conditions in the particle transport at these energies , close to the rectilinear propagation , for which a major cloudlet size translates into a higher ion flux in the local zone . in conclusion , neither the bend positions in the energy axis nor the spectral index in the fall , are significantly modified by the cloudlet radius around the reference value of @xmath54 @xmath25 adopted in this calculation .",
    "it is well known that the differential energy spectrum of the cosmic radiation conforms to a power law like @xmath44@xmath174 where @xmath44 is a constant , @xmath175 is the kinetic energy of the ions and @xmath176 the spectral index . by the term @xmath0",
    "is meant both the change in the spectral index from @xmath177 to @xmath178 and the nominal energy where this change occurs , at about @xmath179 @xmath2 .",
    "a third basic peculiarity , not analyzed in this study , is the phase in the arrival direction of cosmic ions at earth , which has been unambiguously measured below and above the @xmath0 energy ( see , for example ref.[21 ] ) displaying a characteristic modification .",
    "the @xmath0 was discovered in 1958 [ 22 ] .",
    "this fundamental observation refers to all particles of the spectrum hereafter denoted @xmath180 @xmath181 , to distinguish it from the @xmath182 @xmath183 of individual ions .",
    "recently , in the last 10 years , the two major characteristics of the @xmath0 have lost some of their fundamental importance since measurements of the energy spectra of single ions , in large energy bands , have been reported [ 23 , 24 , 25 ] and their @xmath3 differ from that of the complete spectrum .",
    "thus , nowadays the particular energies at which the changes of the spectral indexes of proton and helium take place are known , and the energy spectra as well . for the ion group cno , for silicon and for iron",
    "the @xmath3 have not yet been observed [ 24 , 26 ] though they are foreseen by many theorists .",
    "let us notice explicitly that the measured energy spectra of helium , cno elements and iron between @xmath57-@xmath77 @xmath2 are thoroughly different from the complete spectrum .",
    "this spectrum has a constant slope with @xmath176 = @xmath54 in the interval @xmath179 - @xmath184 @xmath2 while the helium spectrum exhibits a slope depending on the energy .",
    "these facts allow to state , for example , that cosmic - ray intensity beyond the knee , for three energy decades , is not due to the contributions of the intensities of many ions , each ion with a parallel slope @xmath176 = 3 .",
    "as a long series of measurements indicate , but particularly those from jacee [ 27 , 28 ] and runjob [ 29 ] , the spectral index of proton and helium is @xmath185 , fairly constant in the range @xmath186 - @xmath104 @xmath2 . taking this datum as a valuable reference and extrapolating to higher energies beyond the knee",
    ", it immediatly results a gap between the computed and measured intensity of the cosmic radiation .",
    "fig.@xmath17[fig : fig20 ] reports this gap , expressed as a reduction factor @xmath74 energy .",
    "one should note that in the three energy decades @xmath127 - @xmath91 @xmath2 this reduction factor is quite modest , not reaching the value of 8 at @xmath91 @xmath2 .",
    "the smallness of this factor should be compared with the enormous reduction factor , about @xmath187 , of the complete spectrum in the same energy range .",
    "the comparison of these two different reduction factors suggests interesting deductions developed in a recent study [ 7 ] and the irrefutable implication ( see for example ref.[30 ] ) that the knee is a small perturbation of the @xmath180 @xmath181 .",
    "it is customary debating the experimental data around the @xmath0 , to multiply the complete spectrum by a factor @xmath188 so that changes in the spectral index , and eventually , peaks or dips are magnified .    in fig.@xmath17[fig :",
    "fig21 ] the measured helium spectrum [ 24 ] is reported along with the computed one ( solid thick line ) .",
    "the computed curve is the same displayed in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig15 ] in a narrower energy interval , to better focalize on the experimental data .",
    "the measured helium intensity is normalized to the computed one at the energy of @xmath104 @xmath2 .",
    "this normalization aknowledges and takes advantage of the @xmath189 of @xmath78 versus energy below @xmath190 @xmath2 and of the measured spectral index of 2.7 for helium . in the same fig.@xmath17[fig : fig21 ] is reported the computed iron spectrum ( very thick line ) and the iron data multiplied by @xmath188 with @xmath176 = @xmath191 , being the value of the spectral index measured below @xmath104 @xmath2 [ 31 - 34 ] .",
    "these data are limited to the maximum energy of @xmath117 @xmath2 and up to this energy , as already remarked , no iron @xmath0 is observed .",
    "the iron spectrum measured by the eas - top experiment at the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso [ 35 ] , exhibits the same trend .",
    "other important experiments [ 36,37 ] measuring helium spectra do not have sufficient energy band for a pertinent comparison here .",
    "the computed iron spectrum in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig21 ] has been reduced by a factor @xmath192 with respect to that of helium .",
    "this factor takes into account the different powers of helium and iron sources in the galaxy .",
    "in fact , by a simple comparison of the results of many experiments [ 31 - 37 ] , in three energy decades , it emerges that the helium - to - iron flux ratio is rather stable , amounting to about @xmath192 .",
    "it ranges from 2.8 at @xmath14 @xmath2 decreasing to @xmath193 around @xmath127 @xmath2 .",
    "this value has been derived with no particular screening of the experimental data nor with a sophisticated analysis ; it is however adequate for the data normalization here .",
    "what is silently implied by this normalization is that some physical processes ( particle injection at the sources , acceleration mechanisms , reacceleration , propagation effects others than those considered here , etc . )",
    "regulating the intensity and energy spectra of cosmic rays are remarkably stable with energy in the range @xmath16-@xmath104 @xmath2 . renouncing to this normalization , a major number of difficulties would arise since different mechanisms , probably depending on energy , should match together in such a way to generate an approximate constant he / fe flux ratio , which is unlikely .",
    "the physical quantities in the vertical and horizontal axes of fig.@xmath17[fig : fig21 ] have been arbitrarily altered to test how critical is the accord ; thus , the energy of the experimental data [ 24 , 34 ] , is multiplied by a factor @xmath192 and the iron intensities shifted upward by the @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "fig.@xmath17[fig : fig22 ] reports the results of this computational game and testifies the great and amazing stability of the accord without the effect of the galactic wind .",

    "the results in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig21 ] indicate that the helium @xmath0 is due to the fall of intensity caused by the particular value of the magnetic field strength in the galaxy , limited to 1 - 7 @xmath55@xmath56 . changing the value of the field strength ,",
    "a shift in the position of the @xmath0 along the energy axis is calculated , as vividly show the curves in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig10 ] . also important",
    "is the rise of nuclear cross sections as it stands out by comparing the results shown in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig13 ] and fig.@xmath17[fig : fig15 ] .",
    "of capital importance in this conclusion , is the assumption that cosmic rays are galactic at the energies considered .",
    "the computed helium knee agrees with the experimental data up to the energy of @xmath196 @xmath2 .",
    "the helium data ( three data points ) above this energy seem to fall too steeply .",
    "the relevance of this deviation has to be compared with the large error bars and severe uncertainties in the experimental data [ 25 ] beyond the energy of @xmath117 @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the extrapolation of these data [ 25 ] at @xmath197 @xmath2 leads to an irriducible conflict with the outcomes of the haverah park and hires experiments around @xmath197 @xmath2 , as discussed below .",
    "let us compare this explanation of the @xmath0 with some previous attempts ; these may be subdivided in six classes , depending on the physical mechanism invoked .",
    "( @xmath198 ) particle propagation inside the disk does not allow a uniform containment , as the energy increases , because the magnetic field strength is finite , amounting to about @xmath98-@xmath199 @xmath55@xmath56 [ 38 - 43 ] .",
    "( @xmath200 ) the acceleration mechanisms of the galactic sources[44 - 49 ] become inefficient beyond a maximum energy , denoted here @xmath201 , related to the specific acceleration process called into play . beyond @xmath201 a decline of the intensity at earth should be observed .",
    "the regions where cosmic ion suffer acceleration are supernovae remnants , pulsar atmosphere or , possibly , the entire galaxy through reacceleration in the galactic wind [ 45 ] .",
    "( @xmath202 ) cosmic - ion interactions with nuclei in the earth atmosphere , in particular reactions channels , would yield exotic secondary particles that might escape an efficient detection[50 , 51 ] generating the @xmath0 .",

    "( @xmath204 ) cosmic - ion interactions with photons present around the sources [ 54 ] , ( @xmath205 ) or with background neutrinos in particular sites [ 55 , 56 ] would induce effects in the intensity at earth to account for the knee .",
    "most attempts become obsolete once the measurements of individual knees are acknowledged , since the positions of the bends along the energy axis differ from that of the complete spectrum at about @xmath179 @xmath2 , where some tentative explanations were addressed or tuned . moreover ,",
    "the explanations ( @xmath202 ) , ( @xmath204 ) , ( @xmath205 ) require unobserved particles or astrophysical conditions whose physical reality is , at variance , not proved or uncertain or very uncertain ; as a consequence , calling them to account for the @xmath0 problem seems hazardous .",
    "the solution of the knee problem discussed here belongs to the class @xmath198 .",
    "it is based on well established observational facts incorporated in a limited set of parameters .",
    "this solution exhibits , step by step , how these parameters forge the bend and the fall of the helium and iron intensities between @xmath104-@xmath197 .",
    "since the computed helium and iron @xmath3 fairly join the available experimental data , as shown in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig23 ] , a small margin is left for other physical phenomena to account for the origin of the @xmath3 . in particular , from this investigation follows that acceleration mechanisms , ion filtering at injection to the galactic sources or other phenomena , are of little importance for the @xmath0 explanation .",
    "this conclusion reinforce a similar one [ 7 ] , based on observational and theoretical arguments , indicating that acceleration mechanisms have a negligible effect in generating the @xmath3 , regardless of the site and specific acceleration process invoked .",
    "finally , we can not fail to mention that the results of this study demonstrate the existence of a robust extragalactic component in the energy decade @xmath136 - @xmath91 @xmath2 .    if the energy spectra of helium and proton will continue to decrease as suggested by the experimental data [ 22,24 ] ,",

    "therefore , the proton and helium intensities above the @xmath0 energies are expected to increase again .",
    "the particular energies at which the ascents would take place and their steepnesses , for each ion , are still experimentally vague . according to this study it is impossible , using only galactic sources , to generate large fractions of protons , helium , cno or iron around the energy of @xmath91 @xmath2 because the computed intensities in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig15 ] invariantly fall with energy with a spectral index greater than @xmath54 .",

    "the spatial distribution of the sources in the frame @xmath224 have an approximate symmetry in + -@xmath226 and in + -@xmath230 as displayed in figure 6 and 7 .",
    "small distortions of these symmetries are expected , for example , on the fact that the magnetic field strength shown in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig3 ] is not completely symmetric along the principal field line .",
    "ion type , its energy and nuclear cross sections are always specified at the beginning of each trajectory simulation .",
    "particle propagation through the galactic volume initiates at some point , of coordinates @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and terminates at a final point specified by the events described in section 4 .",
    "the initial point is the source position , or eventually , the nuclear collision point , where the secondary particles are generated .",
    "nuclear decays , presently dormant , are also handled by the code @xmath13 .",
    "the trajectory links the source to the final point .",
    "trajectories are subdivided in short and long segments .",
    "the long segments are those contained in the regular field .",
    "they are sampled according to an exponential function with a mean value of @xmath31 @xmath25 [ 12 ] .",
    "this quantity is regarded as @xmath239 @xmath240 of the field .",
    "the short segments are those developed inside the magnetic cloudlets .",
    "the full trajectory is a sequence of long and short segments .",
    "several thousands of segments are involved in a typical trajectory in the disk volume , and hundreds of thousands in the halo .",
    "each segment is regarded as a helix of constant radius .    in a trajectory segment",
    "the magnetic field strength is taken constant and equal to its value , at the beginning of a segment , in spite of the variable field strength , as displayed in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig3 ] . since a typical trajectory",
    "is dispersed in a large volume , this simplification , on average , do not affect the quantities calculated in the present paper .",
    "the helices shown in figure 4 are drawn under this hypothesis .",
    "a further simplification adopted at low energy , below @xmath190 @xmath2/@xmath113 , in order to reduce the computing time , is to identify the helix axes with the trajectory axes .",
    "the ion gyroradius is quite small at low energy compared to the size of the disk .",
    "hence , the resulting helices have many turns . in this case the direction of motion of the ion at the final point of the trajectory segment ( ab in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig4 ] ) is uniformly distributed about the helix axis , as shown by the cone in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig4 ] .",
    "thus magnetic cloudlets , as they are randomly oriented , not only scatter particles in all directions , but they can invert the direction of the motion .    at very high energy , above @xmath190 @xmath2/@xmath113 , depending on the number of turns of the ion in the helix ( less than @xmath98 , a few or many turns ) , different algorithms are at work for shaping the physical trajectories .",
    "fig.@xmath17[fig : fig4 ] shows helices of three different radii to qualitatively illustrate some categories of trajectories .",
    "the segment @xmath52 in fig.@xmath17[fig : fig4 ] represents either the size of a cloudlet or that of a regular field segment .",
    "as an example , the particle escaping with a velocity vector @xmath241 tangent to the helix arc in @xmath35 illustrates how the simulation algorithms handle very energetic particles leaving a field region cell . note that the length of the segment @xmath242 equals the size of the magnetic field region .    at some energy , particles",
    "travel less than one turn , along the helicoidal path , in a magnetic field region of specified strength . using an average field strength of @xmath98 @xmath55 g and an arbitrary energy of @xmath88 @xmath2 ,",
    "the helium gyroradius is @xmath243 @xmath25 .",
    "it is of importance to determine the energies where the invertion of motion operated by magnetic field ceases completely signaling an almost rectilinear propagation of cosmic ions .",
    "this takes place for @xmath98 @xmath55 g field strength at @xmath88 @xmath2 for helium and @xmath91 @xmath2 for iron . beyond these energies",
    ", helium trajectories are fractions of helix arcs , becoming almost straight line segments at higher and higher energies . in this case",
    "the simulation code generates the exact forms of the trajectories , as far as the magnetic field strength and its size , in the sequence of long and short trajectory segments , corresponds to the correct representation of the physical reality .",
