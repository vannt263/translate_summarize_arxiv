    "x - ray and soft @xmath0-ray ( hereafter x@xmath0 ) spectra from luminous accreting black holes ( hereafter bh ) , i.e. , agns and bh binaries , commonly show a distinct component due to compton reflection ( lightman & white 1988 ; magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) of the primary continuum from a cold medium ( e.g. , pounds et al .",

    "a very interesting property of compton reflection with a number of potential physical implications is that its relative strength , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the solid angle of the cold reflector as seen from the hot plasma , correlates with some other spectral and timing properties of many sources ( e.g. , zls99 ; gcr00 ) .",
    "another correlation often found in both seyferts and bh binaries is between x - ray spectral index and x - ray flux ( e.g. , chiang et al .",

    "2002b , hereafter z02 ; lamer et al .  2003 ; gliozzi , sambruna & eracleous 2003 ) .",
    "the x - ray flux is also correlated with the level of radio emission in the hard states of bh binaries ( corbel et al .",
    "2000 ; gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) .",
    "all these correlations appear to reflect fundamental properties of bh accretion flows .",
    "we critically study the correlations , relationships between them , their theoretical models , and the corresponding physical implications . in appendix",
    "a , we present properties of spectral variability due to a power - law pivoting , which process is closely related to the flux - index correlation as well as it puts constraints on the interpretation of the radio  x - ray correlation . in spectral fits , we use xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "the first to find a correlation of compton reflection with another spectral property were ueda , ebisawa & done ( 1994 ) , who found that @xmath2 correlates with the x - ray photon spectral index , @xmath3 , in the bh candidate gx3394 , albeit their result was based on only five observations ( by _ ginga _ ) . later",

    "these results were mostly obtained with spectra constrained to energies below a few tens of kev . however , in many instances , we also have at our disposal broad - band spectra extending to several hundred of kev , where almost the entire range of the reflection spectrum is found to fit the data very well , together with thermal comptonization ( e.g. , the hard states of cyg x-1 , gierliski et al .  1997 , and gx 3394 , zdziarski et al .",

    "1999 ) . very importantly",
    ", the strength of reflection was also found to correlate with the low - frequency qpo centroid frequency and with the degree of the relativistic smearing of the fe k@xmath4 line ( associated with reflection , ycki & czerny 1994 ) , see fig .  4 in gilfanov et al .",

    "we note that the above results concern bh binaries in their luminous ( and mostly hard ) states .",
    "existing data are insufficient to constrain reflection in quiescent states of bh binaries .",
    "however , given the prevalent theoretical interpretation of the correlation as due to feedback between a cold accretion disc and hot plasma ( section [ feedback ] ) , we do not expect it to be present in quiescence as the disc is then cut off at a large radius ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1995 ) and comptonization of synchrotron photons usually dominates x - rays ( e.g. , wardziski & zdziarski 2000 ) .",
    "analogously , we do not expect an @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation in low - luminosity agns .",
    "the picture of the correlation disappearing with the decreasing luminosity is indeed confirmed in the bh transient gs 2023 + 338 .",
    "the results of ycki et al .",
    "( 1999 ) show an @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation in the initial luminous hard state , but then the spectrum substantially softened at an approximately constant @xmath2 when the luminosity decreased by a factor @xmath5 .",
    "this effect is most likely due to the onset of the dominance of comptonization of synchrotron photons with decreasing luminosity ( wardziski & zdziarski 2000 ) .",
    "similarly , reflection is weak in the transient xte j1118 + 480 ( frontera et al .  2001b ; miller et al .  2002 ) , which maximum luminosity was only about @xmath6 of the eddington one in this object may still be @xmath7 found by the former authors . ] .",
    "the first to report an @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation in an agn were magdziarz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , in the seyfert-1 galaxy ngc 5548 .",
    "then , zls99 showed the presence of a strong @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation in 47 _ ginga _ observations of 23 agns ( mostly seyfert 1s and a few intermediate - type agns ) .",
    "matt ( 2001 ) presented a compilation of _ bepposax _ results for seyfert 1s , and found that @xmath2 is correlated with @xmath3 in the full sample at the confidence level of @xmath8 , and @xmath9 if one object in which the measurement of the continuum was probably affected by a soft excess is not taken into account .",
    "a similar sample was later studied by perola et al .",
    "( 2002 , hereafter p02b ) .",
    "zdziarski & grandi ( 2001 , hereafter zg01 ) showed that compton reflection in broad - line radio galaxies ( also called radio - loud seyfert 1s ) , albeit weaker on average than in radio - quiet agns , is still consistent with the same correlation .",
    "nandra et al.(2000 , hereafter n00 ) found an @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation in multiple _ rxte _ observations of the seyfert galaxy ngc 7469 .",
    "papadakis et al .",
    "( 2002 , hereafter p02a ) have found this correlation in the average properties of four seyferts .",
    "[ og_agn ] summarizes those ( and some other ) results .",
    "it is , however , of importance to consider possible effects that may lead to spurious @xmath2-@xmath3 correlations .",
    "we consider below in detail statistical and systematic effects .",
    "the main statistical effect is due to the fitted strength of reflection and spectral index for a single observation being correlated to certain degree , resulting in a skewness of their joint error contour .",
    "any data have limited statistics , and then the same intrinsic @xmath1020 kev spectrum can be fitted within some confidence limit with either a somewhat harder index and less reflection or a softer index and more reflection . this effect is more important for agns than for bh binaries , as the former have usually significantly lower statistics .    as usual with this type of effects , its importance decreases with increasing statistics .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ contours]a , the extent of typical error contours for seyferts is _ much less _ than the global extent of the correlation , and the inclination of an individual contour is also significantly steeper from that of the correlation .",
    "thus , it is already very unlikely that statistical effects alone can account for this distribution .    then , vaughan & edelson ( 2001 , hereafter ve01 ) considered 120 simulated _ rxte _ spectra based on observations of mcg 6 - 30 - 15 with short exposure times of @xmath113.7 ks and the top layer of the _ rxte _ pcus 02 .",
    "they used a power - law model with @xmath3 in a relatively narrow range , @xmath122.15 for 90 per cent of the simulated spectra , and constant reflection at @xmath13 .",
    "they fitted the simulated spectra with @xmath3 and @xmath14 as free parameters .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath15 formed a skewed elongated contour extending from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "given the assumed narrow range of @xmath3 , the @xmath18 contour obtained by them is equivalent ( except for some spread in the values of @xmath3 and the exposure time ) to the statistical error contour for two parameters .",
    "indeed , the typical error bars provided by ve01 are comparable to the extent of their contour",
    ". however , based on the extent of this contour , ve01 stated that the above statistical effect casted serious doubts on the claim of the correlation by zls99 .",
    "however , most of the error contours of zls99 ( fig .  [ contours]a ) and of those corresponding to _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ results of fig .",
    "[ og_agn ] are much smaller than the contour obtained by ve01 due to much better statistisc . in particular , the typical statistics in the _ ginga _",
    "spectra is an order of magnitude better than those of the 1-orbit simulated spectra of ve01 . also , the shape of the error contour of ve01 is significantly different from those observed ( fig .",
    "[ og_agn ] ) . already based on the above ,",
    "the suggestion of ve01 is unlikely to be correct .    in order to quantitatively",
    "study this issue , we have generated 208 simulated _ rxte _ spectra ( assuming a 0.5 per cent systematic error , which we estimated from our fits to crab data ) with the range of @xmath3 of 1.902.15 ( similar to that of ve01 ) and the constant @xmath19 . in the simulations , we have assumed a source with the constant 210 kev flux of 3.5 ( flux unit is @xmath20 erg @xmath21 s@xmath22 hereafter in this paragraph ) and the exposure of 50 ks for pcus 02 and 30 ks for pcus 34 , similar to that of observations of ngc 7469 , see section [ samples ] below .",
    "the product of the flux and exposure roughly corresponds to typical _ rxte _ measurements shown in fig .",
    "[ og_agn ] .",
    "for example , ngc 5548 has the flux in the range of @xmath2310 , exposures of @xmath2440 ks ( chiang et al .",
    "2000 ; see also section [ samples ] below ) , ic 4329a has the flux of @xmath25 , exposure of @xmath26 ks ( done et al .",
    "2000 ) , and 3c 120 has the flux of @xmath27 , exposure of @xmath28 ks ( eracleous et al .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ contours]b .",
    "we clearly see that the obtained distribution is very different from those in fig .",
    "[ og_agn ] and [ contours]a .",
    "it is also different from the contour of ve01 due to the better statistics .    in fig .",
    "[ contours]b , we also show two representative error contours .",
    "we see that although they correspond to only @xmath29 , they do provide a good measure of the spread of almost all the simulated points .",
    "this overestimate of statistical errrors by xspec is due to the corresponding overestimate of background errors ( added in quadrature to the total ones ) discussed by n00 and ve01 . in order to account for this effect",
    ", n00 did not include background errors in their data at all , and ve01 performed simulations to estimate the actual errors . in the case of the _ ginga _ data of zls99 , the standard xspec procedure was followed .",
    "thus , the error contours on fig .",
    "[ contours]a are somewhat overestimated .",
    "however , this is a conservative approach , which can only _ reduce _ the measured strength of an actual correlation but will not lead to an appearance of a spurious one .",
    "therefore , we find the suggestion of edelson & vaughan ( 2000 ) ( based on the results of ve01 ) that the correlation of zls99 could be spurious due to inadequate modeling of errors to be incorrect .    results of simulations with a larger range of the input @xmath3 ( and other assumptions similar to those above except for the systematic error being now 0.01 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ contours]c .",
    "these results also show how the fitted values of @xmath3 and @xmath14 correlate with the ones assumed .",
    "we see no systematic effects here apart from the dispersion of the fitted value of @xmath14 increasing with the increasing @xmath3 ( due to decreasing photon statistics at high energies ) .    to further study possible contributions from statistical effects ,",
    "we have also performed analogous simulations ( using the exposure time , 5.4 ks , and response as for a _ ginga _ observation of ngc 3516 .",
    "thus , this set of simulations corresponds to the actual exposure of @xmath30 ks , which is still a half of the actual average exposure in the data of zls99 of 20 ks . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of background errors in xspec is generally overestimated ( n00 , ve01 ) , and thus the present simulations may better represent the actual uncertainties than those in figs .",
    "[ contours]b - c . ] ) assuming @xmath14 to be random in the 01.5 range .",
    "results for 100 simulated spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ contours]d .",
    "we see that the obtained distribution is still very different from that of fig.[contours]a .",
    "our results confirm the finding of zls99 that the probability that a spectrum with @xmath18 measured to be at the high end of the extent of the correlation shown in fig .",
    "[ contours]a would correspond in reality to a point at a low end of the correlation is extremely low .",
    "zls99 noted that @xmath31 contours are skewed and elongated ( see fig.[contours]a ) , and thus used a statistical method taking into account the correlated errors while looking for the actual functional dependences between parameters .",
    "based on comparison of the resulting values of @xmath32 ( bevington & robinson 1992 ) , zls99 determined the probability of the correlation appearing by chance as @xmath33 .",
    "the exact value may be somewhat different because the model with an allowed @xmath34 dependence yields @xmath35 ( which reflects the intrinsic spread of the data ) .",
    "still , the probability of reducing @xmath32 from 312 ( assuming constant @xmath2 ) to 115 ( allowing for a phenomenological @xmath36 $ ] dependence as a power law ) by chance is in any case @xmath37 .",
    "we see in figs .",
    "[ og_bhb ] , [ og_agn ] and [ contours]a that apart from the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , there is also a clear intrinsic spread of the values of those parameters in the observed @xmath3-@xmath2 space .",
    "this spread is caused by varying model assumptions used in the references on which figs .",
    "[ og_bhb ] , [ og_agn ] are based , differences in calibration of different instruments , and , last but not least , fluctuations due to some physical effects ( e.g. , orientation ) superimposed on the overall @xmath34 dependence .",
    "the last effect is rather common in astrophysics , in which it is very rare that any two quantities are correlated without any influence of other parameters of the system . in the case of bh binaries , we see a full width of @xmath38 or so for a given @xmath3 , whereas it is @xmath39 for seyferts .",
    "thus , a finding of no @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation in a small sample can not be taken as a proof of the lack of it , even if the statistical quality of data is very good .",
    "furthermore , a sample with poor statistics can not be considered a basis of a proof for either presence or absence of the correlation .",
    "for example , the data points for gx 3394 by wilms et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have so large error bars and so limited range of @xmath3 and @xmath2 that no statement about the correlation can be made at all . in the case of that source , the actual presence of a strong correlation ( see fig .",
    "[ og_bhb ] ) has later been established by revnivtsev et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and nowak et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . then , p02b claimed the @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation to be relatively weak in their sample of seyferts .",
    "however , the error bars in their data are large enough for their data to permit the actual presence of a strong correlation .",
    "the same holds for the similar data set of matt ( 2001 ) , who raised the issue of the influence of statistical effects on the @xmath34 correlation found by him in the _ bepposax _ data but presented no calculations to test it .",
    "various systematic effects might affect the best fit values of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 and can lead to biased estimates and to contradiction between results obtained by different instruments and using different spectral models . in certain circumstances",
    "these effects could potentially lead to appearance of spurious corelations between parameters .",
    "these effects are considered below .",
    "n00 noted that a background subtraction with a systematic relative error with a specific power - law dependence on energy ( reaching 0.03 at 20 kev ) may produce a spurious @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation in their _ rxte _ data for ngc 7469 .",
    "however , it is easy to see that this would be the case only if the dominant variability pattern corresponded to a pivot point at low energies , @xmath40 kev .",
    "apart from the specific case of ngc 7469 , we show in section [ index_flux ] that the typical pivot energy in seyferts is @xmath41 kev , which , in turn , would produce an @xmath2-@xmath3 anticorrelation .",
    "thus , this explanation can not be general . also",
    ", in section [ samples ] below , we reanalyze the data of n00 with an updated pca background model and recover the same correlation .",
    "furthermore , we consider it extremely unlikely that background would be undersubtracted in the same way in agns observed by _",
    "ginga _ , _ bepposax _ , and _",
    "rxte_.    then , weaver et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and later p02b and malzac & petrucci ( 2002 , hereafter mp02 ) , noted that a correction needs to be made to account for the high - energy cutoff in the spectra .",
    "namely , the lower the cutoff the fewer incident photons are available for reflection , and then the fitted value of @xmath14 increases .",
    "a related important effect not noticed by p02b is the downward curvature of the incident model spectrum ( present in the e - folded power law but not necessarily in comptonization models ) being compensated by an increase in the reflection strength .",
    "these two effects help to explain the offset between the _ ginga _ and _ bepposax _ results at low values of reflection noticed by lubiski & zdziarski ( 2001 ) , and seen in fig .",
    "[ og_agn ] . on the other hand , p02b notice that the resulting correction to @xmath2 can not by itself remove the presence of the correlation .",
    "we also point out here the existence of an important correction to the x - ray index not taken into account by p02b .",
    "it is the difference between the asymptotic low - energy index , @xmath42 , of an e - folded power law , @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 is the photon number ) , and the actual x - ray index between two energies , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the latter equals @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and the second equality corresponds to @xmath49 kev ( limiting the range with possible dominance of a soft x - ray excess or effects of ionized absorption ) and @xmath50 kev , used by zls99 . at @xmath51 kev assumed by them , @xmath52 , which is negligibly small .",
    "thus , the correlation presented in zls99 concerns the actual hard x - ray index .    on the other hand",
    ", this model fitted to _",
    "data on seyferts by p02b ( see also matt 2001 ) yield generally lower values of @xmath53 .",
    "then , the fitted values of @xmath14 increase somewhat with respect to those corresponding to fits with no cutoff .",
    "for example , for @xmath54 kev , the fitted value of @xmath2 increases by @xmath55 per cent ( p02b ) .",
    "however , as pointed out above , the value of the index needs to be corrected as well , with @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , the two points p02b found to disagree with the correlation of zls99 both require substantial corrections in @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , @xmath57 kev fitted by p02b for mrk 509 yields a rather large @xmath58 , increasing the 320 kev index from @xmath59 ( p02b ) to @xmath60 . taking into account both corrections , to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , makes the _ bepposax _ results ( matt 2001 ; p02b ) quite compatible with those from _ ginga _ of zls99 ( see fig .",
    "[ og_agn ] ) .    furthermore , we point out that an e - folded power law is actually a very bad model for thermal comptonization , which physical model fits well the spectra of seyferts at high energies ( e.g. , zdziarski , poutanen & johnson 2000 ) . for spectral parameters characteristic to both seyferts and bh binaries , thermal comptonization has a much sharper cutoff ( following an extended , power - law like , part of the spectrum ) than that of the e - folded power law .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ compton]a , b for two cases approximately spanning the range of parameters of p02b .",
    "this further demonstrates that @xmath42 of the e - folded power law model has no direct physical meaning .",
    "the inadequacy of the e - folded power law model was also noted by mp02 , who have found that the sharper cutoffs of the thermal comptonization spectra lead to the increase of the value of @xmath2 being substantially less than that for the e - folded power law .",
    "concluding , results of fits with e - folded power laws need to be treated with caution .",
    "we also note that zdziarski et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and gondek et al .",
    "( 1996 ) obtained values of @xmath61 kev for the average seyfert spectra using data from the _ cgro_/osse detector ( which affords coverage to significantly higher energies than _ bepposax _ ) , i.e. , substantially higher than those from _ bepposax_.    in general , there are many other potential systematic effects that can affect the absolute determination of @xmath14 , e.g. , due to an approximate treatment of ionization of the reflecting medium .",
    "then , in order to test the reality of the correlation , we should ask whether a given set of fits properly ranks the spectra by the reflection strength .",
    "this issue was addressed by gilfanov et al .",
    "( 1999 , see their fig .  7 ) and revnivtsev et al .",
    "( 2001 , see their fig .",
    "3 ) in the case of cyg x-1 and gx 3394 , respectively .",
    "they have shown that the _ ratio _ of the count spectrum fitted with a higher value of @xmath14 to that fitted with a lower value itself has the shape characteristic to compton reflection .",
    "this confirms that fits using relatively simple reflection models do provide a correct ranking in the values of @xmath14 .",
    "we would also like to comment on the use of a normalization of the reflection spectrum of nandra & pounds ( 1994 ) and n00 .",
    "they characterized the strength of reflection by the 1-kev flux , @xmath62 , of a power law with the same @xmath3 as the incident one but normalized to @xmath19 .",
    "although equivalent to using the measured @xmath14 , this definition may lead to a spurious systematic correlation between @xmath62 and @xmath3 . to illustrate it ,",
    "let us consider @xmath63 constant .",
    "a common variability pattern of the x - ray power law spectra of both agns and bh binaries is variable @xmath3 with an approximately constant pivot energy , @xmath64 , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the normalization at @xmath64 , and usually @xmath67 kev ( see section [ index_flux ] below ) .",
    "then , @xmath68 i.e. , @xmath62 is strongly positively correlated with @xmath3 even if the actual reflection solid angle remains constant .",
    "thus , we advise against using this measure of reflection .",
    "( we note , however , that the specific data for ngc 7469 of n00 show @xmath3 uncorrelated with the x - ray flux , in which case the above effect is not critical and probably does not affect substantially results of that paper . )",
    "another issue to bear in mind when considering evidence for and against the @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation are the distinctions between different classes of sources and between samples of sources and repeated observations of a single source .",
    "the evidence for the presence of this correlation in seyferts was given by zls99 mostly for broad - line seyfert 1s as a class .",
    "repeated observations of single seyferts give mixed results , sometimes showing the correlation in a given source ( e.g. , magdziarz et al .",
    "1998 for ngc 5548 ; n00 for ngc 7469 , also see below ) , and sometimes not , e.g. , in ic 4329a ( done et al .  2000 ) and some other sources ( p02b ) .    fig .",

    "the data are the same as those of n00 , but they have been reextracted by us using the lheasoft 5.2 version of the pca response matrix and the background model .",
    "we used pcus 04 whenever available and grouped the data in 4-day segments , and included a 0.5 per cent systematic error .",
    "this yields the exposure times of @xmath5570 and @xmath7050 ks for the pcus 02 and 34 , respectively .",
    "the contours clearly show a correlation ( which would become even stronger after the reduction of the statistical errors discussed by n00 and ve01 , see also section [ statistical ] ) . in order to test its reality ,",

    "the former correlation ( also manifesting itself as pivoting ) is likely due to variability in the flux / luminosity of seed soft photons ( emitted by some cold medium ) irradiating a hot plasma being much stronger than the variability of the flux / luminosity from the hot plasma itself . the main radiative process in the hot plasma needs to be thermal compton upscattering of the soft photons .",

    "the correlation with the qpo frequency is expected because that frequency is very likely to be related in some way to the keplerian frequency at the inner edge of the cold disc , which increases with the decreasing disc inner radius . at the same time , the closer the reflecting medium to the bh the higher the degree of the relativistic smearing .",
    "the model naturally explains the pivoting behaviour of the x - ray spectra ( manifesting itself in x - rays as a @xmath3-@xmath72 correlation ) as driven by the variable flux of irradiating seed photons ( zg01 ; z02 ) .",
    "also , the specific @xmath3-@xmath72 correlations observed in many accreting bhs indicate the bolometric luminosity increases in those sources with the increasing @xmath3 ( section [ index_flux ] ) .",
    "this scenario can account for this behaviour if the inner radius of the cold disk decreases with the increasing accretion rate .",
    "such a behaviour is indeed postulated in models of advection - dominated accretion ( e.g. , esin et al .",
    "1997 ) as well as predicted by models of accretion disk evaporation ( meyer , liu & meyer - hofmeister 2000 ; raska & czerny 2000 ) .",
    "on the other hand , it also appears likely that some instabilities can affect the disc truncation radius even if the bolometric luminosity remains approximately constant , which is observed in some objects ( see section [ index_flux ] ) .",
    "chiang & blaes ( 2001 , 2003 ) and chiang ( 2002 ) have shown that detailed versions of this model can also explain the overall optical / uv / x - ray variability in a few seyferts ( ngc 3516 , ngc 5548 , ngc 7469 ) .",

    "these problems can be possibly resolved by anisotropy of the emission of the hot plasma or the outer disc being concave .",
    "it is also possible that detections of such large reflection are due to imperfection of the spectral models used and/or data inaccuracies .    in the framework of this model ,",
    "radio emission arises from outflows in the hot inner flow ( e.g. , blandford & begelman 1999 ) .",

    "this is clearly much less than the observed spectral variability in many sources ( section [ index_flux ] ) , which rules out this model .",
    "the predictions for coronae not dominated by pairs depend , in turn , on the choice of the coronal optical depth , @xmath148 . at @xmath149",
    ", @xmath3 would decrease with the flux , contrary to the data , but coronae with lower @xmath148 could be reconciled with data .",

    "this property is also shared by static disc coronae in general , and it follows from the dependencies shown by haardt et al .",
    "also , static coronae can not by themselves explain the formation of radio jets .",
    "an interpretation of the @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation alternative to the variable overlap of two accretion flows ( section [ flows ] ) is that with mildly relativistic coronal inflows / outflows ( beloborodov 1999a ; malzac et al.2001 )",

    "since the characteristic blackbody seed photon energy is much lower in agns than in bh binaries , a generic prediction of these models is that for a given @xmath2 the value of @xmath3 will be higher in agns than that in bh binaries ( beloborodov 1999b ; malzac et al .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bb ] ( which calculations were performed using a code of coppi 1999 ) .",

    "an important issue here is also the possible presence of a correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath154 for a given @xmath156 .",
    "the feedback models require that the parameters of the hot thermal plasma adjust to variable cooling to satisfy the energy balance . if @xmath148 is constant , this can be done only by changing @xmath154 .",
    "then , an increased cooling yielding an increase of @xmath3 is associated with a decrease of @xmath154 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible that @xmath148 also changes , e.g. , responding to changing accretion rate , which would produce a more complicated behaviour ( e.g. , chiang & blaes 2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "also , if @xmath99  pairs are present , the main adjusting parameter is @xmath148 .",
    "in fact , in the example in fig .",
    "[ bb]b , the softening of the spectrum is associated with an increase ( rather than decrease ) of @xmath154 .    so far there are only limited observational data on correlation between @xmath3 and the high - energy cutoff .",

    "however , mp02 found that this correlation may be an artifact of the e - folded power - law model when used to fit thermal - compton spectra .",
    "they simulated actual thermal comptonization spectra at a _ constant _ @xmath157 kev and a range of @xmath148 , and then found that the simulated spectra when fitted by an e - folded power law yield a correlation resembling that of p02b .",
    "done & nayakshin ( 2001 ) have shown that the optical depth of a highly ionized surface layer on top of a strongly irradiated accretion disc increases with the increasing hardness of the irradiating spectrum .",
    "this gives rise to an apparent @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation as there is less unscattered reflection for harder spectra ( although the actual reflection solid angle is @xmath158 constant ) .",
    "a separate mechanism is then needed to account for the @xmath3-@xmath72 correlation , similarly to the case of the coronal outflow model .",
    "a diagnostic that could yield the actual solid angle of the reflector regardless of the ionization level is a measurement of reflection at high energies .",
    "namely , the reflection spectrum is cut off at high energies with a functional form independent of the ionization state ( white , lightman & zdziarski 1988 ) .",
    "fig.[ionref ] illustrates this point for an incident spectrum from comptonization ( poutanen & svensson 1996 ) with @xmath159 kev and @xmath160 in spherical geometry , yielding the 210 kev index of @xmath161 .",
    "this @xmath3 corresponds to the case with the lowest fitted neutral reflection from a strongly ionized medium with the actual @xmath19 in done & nayakshin ( 2001 ) . to illustrate this effect",
    ", we assumed that the reflecting medium is so strongly ionized that virtually no fe k edge appears in the reflection component ( dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ ionref ] ) .",
    "although the reflected component is simply a power law at low energies , it still does have a high energy cutoff due to klein - nishina effects .",
    "the solid curve shows the total spectrum .",
    "then , the dashed curve shows the incident spectrum without reflection normalized to coincide with the spectrum from the strongly ionized medium .",
    "we see that although the spectra at @xmath162 kev are indeed barely distinguishable , the form of their high - energy cutoffs is very different .",
    "thus , this model can be tested using broad - band x@xmath0  spectra extending to several hundred of kev .",
    "a set of @xmath971000 kev spectra of cyg x-1 in the hard state was analyzed by gierliski et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who found the form of the high - energy cutoff compatible with thermal comptonization .",
    "although those authors have not consider the ionized - reflection model , those spectra have not shown any hint of the softening of the cutoff of the type seen in the solid curve in fig.[ionref ] ; rather they indicated some additional hardening ( interpreted by them as due to the presence of an additional spectral component from saturated comptonization ) .",
    "independently of the present work , barrio , done & nayakshin ( 2003 ) have recently fitted the ionized reflection model to broad - band spectral data from the pca and hexte detectors of _ rxte _ for cyg x-1 .",
    "they have found this model to be ruled out by the lack of a break in the hexte data , in favour of the model with a truncated disk and intrinsically weak reflection .",
    "future tests of this model are highly desirable , e.g. , using data from _ integral _ and _ astro - e2_.    the effect shown in fig .",
    "[ ionref ] also demonstrates that the albedo , @xmath163 , of a fully ionized medium energy - integrated over a spectrum characteristic to accreting bhs is still substantially less than unity ( see also white et al.1988 ) .",
    "indeed , in the specific case in fig .",
    "[ ionref ] , @xmath164 , only moderately larger than the corresponding albedo for a neutral reflector , @xmath165 .",
    "this shows that a fully ionized surface layer of an accretion disc would radiate substantial soft thermal flux even in the absence of an internal dissipation .",
    "this may rule out the ionized - disc model of the hard state of cyg x-1 of young et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in general",
    ", the resulting constraints on the geometry will be relatively similar to those in the case of a nearly - neutral disc ( e.g. , stern et al .",
    "1995 ) , and , in particular , will still rule out the presence of a homogeneous corona above the disc .",
    "n00 have pointed out that the presence of a constant reflection component from a distant medium ( presumably a molecular torus ) in agns together with a variable power law ( from hot plasmas in the vicinity of the bh ) can lead to an apparent correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath2 if reflection in the fitted model is tied to the variable power law . in particular ,",
    "when the power law varies with a characteristic pivot energy of @xmath40 kev , the fitted @xmath2-@xmath3 dependence will be positive ( i.e. , the softer the spectrum , the larger the relative contribution of reflection ) , as illustrated in fig.[pivot]a .",
    "this idea has been developed in detail by mp02 .",
    "they have considered cases with the pivot energy of 2 , 5 and 10 kev , and have shown that the @xmath2-@xmath3 dependence in seyferts ( fig .",
    "[ og_agn ] ) can be qualitatively explained by this type of model .",
    "however , we have shown in section [ index_flux ] that the pivot energy in many seyferts is @xmath166 kev . then , if this effect were important for a large fraction of seyferts , an @xmath2-@xmath3 _ anticorrelation _ ( see fig .  [",
    "pivot]b ) would be observed for a large fraction of sources , in conflict with the data .",
    "this rules out the origin of the global @xmath2-@xmath3 dependence in seyferts from this effect . on the other hand",
    ", this effect may be important in some seyferts , and may explain @xmath2-@xmath3 anticorrelation in repeated observations of certain objects ( done et al .",
    "2000 ; p02a ) .    as noted by mp02",
    ", this effect can not play any role in bh binaries .",
    "thus , this model requires completely different origin for the @xmath2-@xmath3 correlations in those objects and in agns .",
    "the results presented in section [ ref_index ] were mostly obtained by fits to the compton - reflection continuum . however ,",
    "the process of bound - free absorption in the reflecting medium is usually followed by emission of a fluorescent fe k@xmath4 line , which equivalent width , @xmath168 , can be tied to that of the reflection ( george & fabian 1991 ; ycki & czerny 1994 ) .",
    "conversely , if relativistic broadening is seen in the line emitted by the reflecting medium , the same broadening should be seen in the reflection spectrum .",
    "thus , the measured parameters of the fe k@xmath4 line should be in agreement with those of reflection .",
    "such an agreement appears to be seen in bh binaries ( gilfanov et al .",

    "2001 ) . some disagreement in gx 3394 claimed by nowak et al .",
    "( 2002 ) appears to be largely caused by a diffuse line component from the interstellar medium dominating in x - ray weak states of this source ( wardziski et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the situation is more complex in seyferts . unlike bh binaries ,",
    "seyferts possess significant fe k@xmath4 line component from distant matter , e.g. , the broad - line regions or molecular torii .",
    "often , that distant matter is thomson thin , and then it gives rise to the line but not to an fe k edge , see , e.g. , section 7.1 and fig .  13 in woniak et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . as shown in that figure ,",
    "the optically - thin reflection component is then relatively negligible .",
    "then , the presence of two line components , one constant ( with or without associated reflection ) and one variable in addition to a variable intrinsic component may cause a rather complex behaviour of variability . for example , the presence of constant line and reflection and a power law pivoting at @xmath30 kev leads to an anticorrelation of @xmath168 and @xmath14 measured with respect to the power law ( see fig .

    "pivot]a , also mp02 ) .",
    "such an effect might have been seen by chiang et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in ngc 5548 .    given this complexity",
    ", it is important to self - consistently account for various components of the line and reflection , their relativistic broadening , and their connection to the incident spectral component .",
    "a self - consistent treatment should in general include at least two line components , narrow and broad , with the broadening ( e.g. , gaussian or disc - like ) and redshift of the latter applied in the same way to the reflection ( e.g , ycki et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; gcr00 , lubiski & zdziarski 2001 ; zdziarski et al .",
    "the strength of reflection should then be tied to that of the line ( george & fabian 1991 ; ycki & czerny 1994 ) .",
    "the dramatic effect of inconsistent treatment of the line and reflection is shown for the case of the disc broadening ( fabian et al.1989 ) in fig .  3 of zdziarski et al .  ( 2002a ) .",
    "then , shih et al .  (",
    "2002 ) showed that fe k@xmath4 line flux in mcg 6 - 30 - 15 remained approximately constant with varying 310 kev _ asca _ count rate .",
    "however , the formation of the line is due to photons only above 7.1 kev or more . in the case of mcg 6 - 30 - 15 , @xmath169 , and then the fraction of the measured _ asca _ counts above 7 kev in their data is only @xmath170 .",
    "the fraction of counts above 8 kev , appropriate for a moderately ionized disc , possibly present in mcg 6 - 30 - 15 ( e.g. , ballantyne & fabian 2001 ) , is as low as @xmath171 .",
    "thus , the lack of a correlation between the 310 kev counts and the line photon flux can not be taken as conclusive evidence against the fe k@xmath4 photons being due to irradiation by photons from the observed continuum .",
    "similarly , the fraction of counts above 7 and 8 kev in the mcg 6 - 30 - 15 data of ve01 is only @xmath7 and @xmath172 , respectively .",
    "the data of ve01 imply a pivot energy at about 80 kev ( table 1 ) ; thus , the variability of the flux above @xmath1738 kev will be in general less than that in the 210 kev band used by them ( as also found by markowitz & edelson 2001 for seyfert 1s in general ) .    as noted in section [ index_flux ] ( as well as by mp02 ) , there are many agns with the pivot at @xmath40 kev ( e.g. , 3c 120 ) .",
    "then , the 710 kev photon flux may be anticorrelated with the 210 kev one . even if the pivot energy is in general at @xmath41 kev",
    ", occasionally the same object may show a pivot at @xmath174 kev , as in the case of ngc 5548 ( nicastro et al .",
    "thus , it is important to use the band above the fe k edge in studies of the continuum - line correlations .",

    "although yaqoob et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have pointed out that the statistical weights used by lubiski & zdziarski ( 2001 ) were not justified statistically , the effect of their correction appears to be only minor ( lubiski , in preparation ) .",
    "indeed , the results of p02b for seyfert 1s observed by _ bepposax _",
    "show an increase of @xmath168 with @xmath3 very similar to that obtained by lubiski & zdziarski ( 2001 ) .",
    "we have considered correlations between various spectral properties of accreting bhs in seyfert galaxies and x - ray binaries , with particular emphasis on the correlations between the x - ray spectral index , strength of compton reflection and the x - ray flux .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "using published data of the observations of seyferts with _ ginga _ , _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ , we have critically re - evaluated the evidence for presence of correlation between the x - ray spectral index and strength of compton reflection .",
    "we conclude that when considering a large number of observations of a large sample of objects , the existence of _ global _ correlation between these two parameters is established beyond any reasonable doubts .",
    "smallness of the error bars in comparison with the extent of the correlation and good agreement of the results obtained by various satellites confirm that the correlation can not be an artifact caused by statistical or systematic effects .",
    "the ratios of the spectra with different values of reflection in bh binaries demonstrate that the correlation can not be a consequence of a trivially inadequate spectral model .",
    "we note , however , that the particular values of the spectral index and , especially , of the strength of the compton reflection , do depend on the details of the spectral approximation .",
    "this fact should taken into consideration when comparing results obtained by different authors .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation shows significant spread , larger than the statistical uncertainties of the data .",
    "it is not clear at present to which degree this spread is intrinsic to the sources and to which degree it is due to imperfectness of the spectral model and/or difference in the details of the spectral approximation .",
    "distinction should be made between classes of objects and multiple observations of individual objects . in the case of luminous bh binaries , spectral variability of individual sources",
    "obeys the general @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation obtained for bh binaries as class . in the case of seyfert galaxies ,",
    "the correlations holds for a class of objects but can be violated for repeated observations of individual objects , remaining , however , within the spread of the global correlation . in our opinion , these results are still inconclusive and require further investigation as a number of complications are involved in the case of seyfert galaxies in comparison with x - ray binaries .",
    "the most obvious among those are lower statistics due to significantly lower brightness of seyferts and existence of molecular tori and broad line regions , which can give additional contribution to the reflected component , and uncorrelated with the comptonized emission on short time scales .",
    "the physical interpretion of the @xmath2-@xmath3 and @xmath3-@xmath72 correlations will advance our understanding of the geometry of the accretion flow in x - ray binaries and seyfert galaxies and impose valuable constrains on the theoretical models . at present , the correlations appear to be a natural consequence of co - existence of cold media ( e.g. , an accretion disc ) and a hot comptonizing cloud in the vicinity of the bh .",
    "their geometrical closeness results in double feedback between the two components of the accretion flow .",
    "the cold medium provides seed soft photons for the comptonization as well as it reprocesses and reflects the hard radiation from the hot plasma . if significant fraction of soft seed photons is due to reprocessing of the hard radiation of the hot cloud , the more reprocessing results in more cooling of the hot plasma and , correspondingly , in the softer x - ray spectra . among the several specific geometries proposed",
    ", the most promising appears to be the disc - spheroid model with variable overlap between the hot and cold components of the accretion flow .",
    "since the characteristic temperature of the accretion disk in agns is much lower than in bh binaries , a generic prediction of this type of models is that for a given value of reflection the value of the spectral index will be higher in agns than in bh binaries , this prediction is in good agreement with the observed behavior .",
    "we presented a diagnostic to test an interpretation of the @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation as due to strong ionization of the disc surface layer .",
    "it utilizes the independence of the klein - nishina cutoff in the reflected spectrum of the ionization state . applied to existing data , this diagnostic",
    "does not support that interpretation .",
    "we found that the pattern of broad - band spectral variability of seyfert galaxies on day - to - month time scale includes a pivoting of a power law spectrum with the pivot at a high energy , usuallly above a few hundred kev .",
    "the pivoting well explains the linear correlations between the logarithm of the x - ray flux and @xmath3 seen in both bh binaries and seyferts .",
    "then , the observed high pivot energies rule out the interpretation of the @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation is seyferts as due to a time - lag effect .    we discuss also the correlation between x - ray and radio fluxes in bh binaries and its physical implications .",
    "we conclude that this correlation is most likely due to relation between the level of x - ray emission and the rate of ejection of radio - emitting clouds forming a compact jet .",
    "although peculiar sources might exist , it seems highly unlikely that the correlation is due to synchrotron origin of the x - ray emission from bh binaries in general .",

    "let us consider spectral variability consisting of pivoting .",
    "namely , an initial spectrum ( a power law or not ) is multiplied by @xmath175 , where @xmath64 is the pivot energy and @xmath176 is a perturbation spectral index . in particular ,",
    "when the initial spectrum is a power law , we have a variable power - law photon spectrum , @xmath177 , where @xmath66 is a constant .",
    "then there is linear relation between the logarithm of the monochromatic flux at a given energy , @xmath95 , and the variable slope , @xmath178 a similar linear relation holds approximately for the energy flux in an interval from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "thus , pivoting results in an ( approximate ) linear dependence between the logarithm of the flux ( not flux itself ) and the spectral index , as illustrated by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fg ] .",
    "if pivoting variability occurs on time scales shorther than a given observation , the measured average spectrum will consist of the initial spectrum ( in particular , a power law itself ) times the average of @xmath179 , @xmath180 .",
    "if @xmath181 constant and the distribution in time of @xmath176 is uniform from @xmath182 to @xmath183 , the flux average is given by , @xmath184 where @xmath185 if the distribution of @xmath176 is gaussian , i.e. , @xmath186 $ ] ( where now @xmath136 is the standard deviation of the distribution of @xmath176 ) , we have , @xmath187 note that the concave form of these spectra yield strong departures from the initial power law at @xmath188 . pivoting on short time scales can account ( at least in part ) for the soft x - ray excesses commonly seen in seyferts and bh binaries .",
    "pivoting may also explain an apparently concave part of the extragalactic @xmath0-ray spectrum ( stecker & salamon 1996 ) , although it requires the pivot energy to be within that part ( which issue was not considered by those authors ) .",
    "this variability will also contribute to the flux variance , @xmath189 .",
    "the variance normalized to the average flux is given by @xmath190 for the uniform distribution of @xmath176 , and @xmath191 for the gaussian distribution of @xmath176 .",
    "with addition of some energy - independent variability , @xmath192 , the ratio @xmath193 reproduces well the fractional variability of cyg x-1 in the hard state on long time scales , see fig .",
    "[ cyg_rms ] .    then , the skewness , @xmath194 , is given by , @xmath195 }      { 3\\left (   x\\coth x-1 \\right)^{3/2 } } } \\nonumber \\\\ \\lefteqn { \\quad\\,\\,\\ , = { 2\\sqrt{3 } \\vert x\\vert \\over 5 } + o(x^3 ) , }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the uniform distribution of @xmath176 , and @xmath196 for the gaussian distribution of @xmath176 .",
    "this quantity may be useful for testing whether a given variability pattern is related to pivoting .",
    "also , the kurtosis , @xmath197 , is given by , @xmath198 - 6 = 16x^2 + o(x^4 ) , \\label{k_g}\\ ] ] for the gaussian distribution of @xmath176 .",
    "on the other hand , it is rather unlikely that the pivot energy is completely constant in an astrophysical system . instead",
    ", a range of pivoting energy is expected from some physical constraints on the emitting plasma , see fig.3 in zg01 and fig .  14 in z02 .",
    "therefore , we also consider a case when the pivot energy is distributed log - normally , i.e. , given by @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is distributed @xmath201 $ ] and @xmath202 is the standard deviation of this distribution .",
    "when @xmath176 is also distributed normally , the average departure from the original spectrum is given by , @xmath203}\\over ( 1-\\delta^2)^{1/2 } } } \\nonumber \\\\ \\lefteqn { \\quad = { 1\\over ( 1-\\delta^2)^{1/2}}+{x^2 \\over 2(1-\\delta^2)^{3/2 } } + o(x^4 ) , } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath204    the variance is then , @xmath205 and the variance normalized to the average flux is , @xmath206 + } \\nonumber",
    "\\\\ \\lefteqn{\\qquad\\quad - { 1-\\delta^2\\over \\left(1 - 2\\delta^2\\right)^{1/2 } } \\exp\\left [ \\delta^2 x^2\\over ( 1 - 2\\delta^2)(1-\\delta^2 ) \\right ] } \\nonumber \\\\ \\lefteqn{\\quad\\,\\ , = ( 1-\\delta^2)\\left [ \\left(1 - 4\\delta^2\\right)^{-1/2 } - \\left(1 - 2\\delta^2\\right)^{-1/2 } \\right ] + } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "note that a finite range of the pivot energy results in a finite variance at @xmath208 , as given by the third line of equation ( [ sigma_f_2 ] ) , in contrast to the case with the fixed pivot , equation ( [ sigma_g ] ) .",
    "thus , the above dependence fits well the long - term behaviour of cyg x-1 in the hard state without an additional constant , see fig.[cyg_rms ] .",
    "above , we assumed that variations of the pivot energy are uncorrelated with those of the spectral index .",
    "note that a correlation between these quantities would result in time lags between light curves measured at different energies ( kotov , churazov & gilfanov 2001 ) .",
    "the moments of the distributions above assume especially simple forms for the logarithm of flux .",
    "we define , @xmath211 where @xmath179 is a departure from the initial spectrum , as above .",
    "then , for a gaussian distribution of @xmath176 and a constant @xmath64 , the distribution of @xmath212 is gaussian itself , with @xmath213 thus , the apparently non - gaussian distribution of the linear flux ( equations [ [ skew_g]][[k_g ] ] ) becomes completely gaussian when its logarithm is used .",
    "such log - normal distributions are , in fact , very common in natural phenomena ranging from terrestrial lightning to @xmath0-ray bursts ( mcbreen et al.1994 ) .",
    "note then that a positive skewness of the distribution of a linear variable ( e.g. , leighly 1999 ) is not necessary an indication of non - gaussianity of the underlying processes .    in the case of gaussian distributions of both @xmath176 and @xmath200",
    ", @xmath212 is a product of two variables ( @xmath176 and @xmath214 ) , each having a gaussian distribution , and @xmath215 note that @xmath216 and @xmath217 are not simply products of the corresponding quantities for each of the two variables due to a non - zero center value of the latter .",
    "then , the resulting distribution of @xmath212 is not completely gaussian , and , in particular , @xmath218 ."
