    "in the field of quantum computation , discoveries like the shor and grover algorithms @xcite have shown a superior efficiency with regard to their classical equivalents . in this frame",
    "the quantum walk ( qw ) on the line @xcite , a natural generalization of the classical random walk , is receiving permanent attention@xcite .",
    "it has been used as the basis for optimal quantum search algorithms @xcite on several topologies and more recently it has been shown that any quantum algorithm can be reformulated in terms of a qw algorithm @xcite , this means that the qw is universal in quantum computation .",
    "in particular the qw has the property to spread over the line quadratically faster than its classical analog .",
    "it remains a challenge to use this quantum property , as well as quantum parallelism and quantum entanglement , to increase the speed and efficiency of the algorithms . in this line of thought , it is important to probe further into the properties of the qw dynamics .    on the other hand",
    "the spectacular development of techniques to manipulate atoms and photons has led to some experimental implementations of the qw @xcite as well as several implementation proposals @xcite . here",
    "the obstacle of decoherence is present owing to imperfections and environmental noise .",
    "several authors have studied the qw subjected to different types of coin operators and sources of decoherence to analyze and verify the principles of quantum theory as well as the passage from the quantum to the classical world @xcite .",
    "these works have shown that the decoherence transforms the quantum behavior into a classical diffusive behavior .",
    "in general , to obtain this conclusion the authors focus their studies in the spreading of the wave - function .",
    "however decoherence may also drive the system to a more general behavior than the diffusive .",
    "@xcite .    in recent work @xcite the global chirality distribution ( gcd ) was defined as the distribution of the chirality independently of position and the asymptotic behavior of the qw was investigated focusing on the gcd without decoherence .",
    "it was shown that the gcd has a stationary long - time limit , a result usually linked to a markovian process .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the asymptotic behavior of the gcd when the system is subjected to two different sources of decoherence . in the first place",
    ", decoherence is introduced through simultaneous measurements of the chirality and particle position .",
    "this treatment allows us to connect the dynamics of the qw with certain aspects of quantum game theory @xcite . in the second place",
    ", the decoherence is introduced through the influence of randomly broken links into the qw dynamics .",
    "this last mechanism may be relevant in experimental realizations of quantum computation based on ising spin-@xmath0 chains in solid - state substrates @xcite .    in the next section we present the standard qw model and the gcd dynamics . in the third section",
    "we build the master equation for the gcd with periodic measurement . in the fourth section we present the coin - flipping games with the gcd . in the fifth section the gcd dynamics with broken links",
    "is studied , and in the last section we draw the conclusions .",
    "in this qw the walker moves ( at discrete time steps @xmath1 ) along a one - dimensional lattice of sites @xmath2 , with a direction that depends on the state of the coin .",
    "the global hilbert space of the system is the tensor product @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hilbert space associated to the motion on the line and @xmath5 is the chirality hilbert space .",
    "the one - qubit coinsubspace , @xmath5 , is spanned by two orthogonal states \\{@xmath6 , @xmath7}. the spatial subspace , @xmath4 , is spanned by the orthogonal set of position eigenstates , @xmath8 .",
    "the evolution is generated by repeated application of a composite unitary operator @xmath9 which implements a coin operation followed by a conditional shift in the position of the walker .",
    "this shift operation entangles the coin and position of the walker . in our case @xmath9",
    "depends on a parameter @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , $ ] that defines the bias of the coin toss ( @xmath12 for an unbiased , or hadamard , coin ) .",
    "then the unitary operator @xmath13 evolves the state in one time step as @xmath14 the state of the total system at time @xmath15 can be expressed as the spinor @xmath16 |k\\rangle ,    \\label{spinor}\\ ] ] where the upper ( lower ) component is associated to the left ( right ) chirality .",
    "therefore , the qw is ruled by a unitary map , its standard form being @xcite @xmath17    in references @xcite it is shown how a unitary quantum mechanical evolution can be separated into markovian and interference terms .",

    "the usual qw dynamics , eq .",

    "this situation makes it interesting to study the decoherence when only some segment on the line is affected by the breakage of links .",
    "such decoherence mechanisms may be relevant as a model of experimental realizations in quantum computation exp , proexp , berman as well as in any problem related to the transfer of quantum information through space using qw @xcite . in order to investigate this type of decoherence",
    ", we propose a composed non - homogeneous qw with two different dynamics starting form the origin : for the left half - line the evolution is determined by eq .",
    "( mapa ) and for the right half - line it is determined by the set of equations eqs . ( [ mapa],[mapa1],[mapa2],[mapa3 ] ) , weighted with the values @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 respectively",
    ". the stochastic behavior of the gcd , for an ensemble of these qws , will depend , for the left side , on the usual qw and , for the right side , on the qw with broken links .",
    "therefore the right half - line chirality distribution satisfies eq .",
    "( [ master1 ] ) and the left half - line chirality distribution satisfies eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) .",
    "from this reasoning , it is clear that the gcd is the sum of the above right and left partial distributions and it satisfies eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) , where the interference term emerges from the amplitudes of the wave function belonging to the left side of the evolution .",
    "however , it should be noted that the incorporation of the interference term of the right side of the evolution does not modify this equation because it remains negligible .",
    "the evolution of the system ceases to be unitary owing to decoherence , however in spite of the stochastic nature of the system re@xmath160 and eq .",
    "( [ estacio ] ) maintains the dependence between the asymptotic values @xmath70 and re@xmath161 .",
    "the system loses its integrability and the explicit value of @xmath70 is to be calculated numerically .",
    "we have performed this calculation , as a function of the probability @xmath125 with @xmath162 using the original maps eqs .",
    "( [ mapa],[mapa1],[mapa2],[mapa3 ] ) with an ensemble of @xmath163 dynamical trajectories and @xmath43 time steps .",

    "( [ estacio ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that there is a perfect agreement between the theoretical stochastic approach presented in this section and the numerical calculation using the original maps .",
    "we also found from the numerical calculation that the asymptotic distribution @xmath70 depends on the initial conditions .",
    "figure [ f7 ] presents the numerical calculation of the distribution @xmath41 , with @xmath164 time steps and the initial condition given by eq .",
    "( [ psi0 ] ) .    comparing fig .",
    "[ f7 ] with fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , it is possible to distinguish several similarities , such as the number of light and dark spots in both figures .",
    "these similarities , show that the asymptotic behavior depends on the initial condition . in other words ,",
    "this type of decoherence erases the unitary behavior of the system but does not completely erase its dependence on the initial condition .",
    "however , the range of values of the probability is now restricted to @xmath165 $ ] while in the fig .",
    "[ f1 ] this range was @xmath166 $ ] .",
    "such a decrease in the range shows that the trend of the system is to go to a single asymptotic distribution that will only depend on the parameter @xmath125 , as seen in fig .",
    "decoherence in quantum systems like the qw has been extensively studied .",
    "analytical and numerical results on the effect of different kinds of noise have shown that quantum properties are highly sensitive to random events . in this paper , we studied the asymptotic behavior of the qw on the line when it is subjected to different sources of decoherence .",
    "we focused on the dynamics of the gcd when decoherence is introduced in two different ways . in the first case decoherence",
    "is introduced through periodic measurements of position and chirality .",
    "it has been shown that the evolution of the gcd , in a time scale involving many measurements , can be described as a markovian process and its master equation has been obtained analytically .",
    "this master equation allows us to build new quantum games , similar to the usual spin - flip game , where as a novelty the players perform measurements on the qw system .",
    "these games are characterized by a continuous space of strategies , and the selection of an initial condition determines the particular strategy chosen by the player .",
    "these games may be used as a tool to study quantum algorithms subjected to external decoherence , as in the extreme case of measurement .    in the second case",
    ", the decoherence is introduced through the influence of randomly broken links affecting the qw dynamics .",
    "two different variants of this second case have been investigated .",
    "these are : ( a ) all the qw links have a certain probability of being broken , the gcd is described by a markovian process . its master equation is obtained analytically and it is shown to be equivalent to the dynamical equation of the density matrix . it was shown that the dynamics is independent both of the breakage probability and of the coin bias of the qw .",
    "( b ) only the links on one of the half - lines ( say the right one ) are affected by the possibility of breakage . in this case",
    "the dynamical evolution of the gcd is not described by a markovian process but it has an asymptotic value that depends on the initial conditions and the breakage probability . here the interference term @xmath167 is not negligible but an asymptotic stationary relation between @xmath167 and the gcd has been analytically found .",
    "the behavior of this composite qw is at first sight unexpected since usually decoherence destroys the unitary correlation , providing a route towards a classical - like behavior described by a markov process . to understand this behavior",
    "suppose a localized initial condition far to the left of the origin , situated thus in a zone where the evolution is determined by the usual qw map .",
    "as time passes , the wave function spreads in both directions and , due to the dynamical evolution of the map , the extreme left branch of the wave function will never be influenced by the existence of decoherence introduced into the right branch of the wave function . in this way",
    ", the wave function keeps some information about the initial condition .",
    "we conclude that the effect of decoherence of the second kind studied in this work does not necessarily transform the quantum system into a dissipative one such as a markov process . in more general terms ,",
    "the mere presence of noise does not assure the transition of a quantum system to classicality .",
