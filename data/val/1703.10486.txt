    "since the discovery of a large thermoelectric power in the layered cobaltate nacoo@xmath3 two decades ago @xcite , this system and closely related ones , particularly ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 ( cco ) , have been studied intensively , both experimentally @xcite as well as theoretically @xcite ; see also refs .   for recent reviews .",
    "layered cobalt oxides , such as cco , are of interest because of the close proximity of the rock - salt ca@xmath3coo@xmath0 and hexagonal coo@xmath3 subsystems which results in a high seebeck coefficient , low thermal conductivity , and , hence , high figure of merit at elevated temperature .",
    "for example , wakisaka et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the electronic structure using x - ray photoemission spectroscopy , ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy , and unrestricted hartree - fock calculations .",
    "they derive a charge - transfer energy of 1 ev between the co sites in the ca@xmath3coo@xmath0 and coo@xmath3 subsystems as well as a @xmath10-@xmath10 coulomb interaction energy of 6.5 ev .",
    "huang et al .",
    "@xcite have investigated the structural , electrical , and thermal transport properties of cco ceramics sintered in a high magnetic field , arguing that this technique is efficient for enhancing the thermopower .",
    "high - resolution photoemission spectroscopy has been used by takeuchi et al .",
    "@xcite to investigate the electronic structure .",
    "these authors argue that the high thermopower is due to the metallic conduction in the hexagonal coo@xmath3 layers .",
    "according to refs .",
    ", the rock - salt subsystem mainly shortens the phonon mean free path and thus lowers the thermal conductivity , while the hexagonal subsystem is responsible for the electrical conductivity .",
    "in addition , the magneto - transport properties are remarkable @xcite ; in particular , a high - temperature ( above 600 k ) spin state transition has been discovered very recently @xcite .",
    "first principles calculations have been performed by asahi et al .",
    "@xcite using a 3/2 ratio for the @xmath11 ( rock - salt ) and @xmath12 ( coo@xmath3 ) lattice parameters , @xmath13 , arguing that the optimized structure with distorted octahedra is in agreement with experiment .",
    "the authors report on p - type conductivity in the rock - salt subsystem , where the fermi energy lies in the crystal - field gap of the @xmath14 states of the coo@xmath3 subsystem .",

    "@xcite have combined temperature - dependent local structure measurements with first - principles calculations to develop a three - dimensional structure model of misfit ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "they find a low coordination of co in the rock - salt layer , which is due to the formation of co chains in the @xmath8-@xmath9 plane linked to the cao layers by co - o bonds oriented along the @xmath15 axis , enabling high electrical and low thermal conductivity .",
    "combining experiment , ab - initio calculations , and semiclassical boltzmann transport theory to investigate the anisotropy of the thermopower in ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals , tang et al .  @xcite find a strongly anisotropic topology of the fermi surface .",

    "@xcite have investigated the atomic and electronic structures employing density functional theory ( dft ) and its extension ( dft+@xmath16 ) .",
    "both methods lead to good agreement of the structural parameters with experiment .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the 5/3 rational approximation , optimize the structure employing density functional theory ( in the vasp implementation ) , and determine the thermoelectric transport coefficients on the basis of boltztrap .",
    "the transport properties are calculated for the pristine and for strained systems , as function of temperature .",
    "substrate effects are discussed for a specific example ( srtio@xmath0 ) .",
    "in particular , we present the structure model in section [ model ] , and computational details in section [ computational ] . the electronic structure and the thermoelectric properties",
    "are addressed in sections [ pristine ] and [ strain ] for pristine and strained cco , respectively .",

    "the subsystems share the @xmath8 and @xmath15 lattice parameters .",
    "the @xmath9 lattice parameters differ so that a rational approximation with a minimal lattice mismatch has to be chosen .",
    "asahi et al .",
    "@xcite have used @xmath17 which corresponds to a mismatch of 7% , whereas the 5/3 ratio employed by rbola et al .",
    "@xcite reduces the mismatch to 3% . contradicting experiment @xcite , the 3/2 ratio results in @xmath14 states of the ca@xmath3coo@xmath0 subsystem at the fermi energy , while the 5/3 ratio leads only to minor contributions .",
    "thus we consider @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath15 lattice parameters initially are set to the experimental values , whereas for the @xmath9 lattice parameter a value of @xmath19   = 14.1 (taken from the coo@xmath3 subsystem ) is used .",

    "for the structural optimization we use the projector augmented wave method as implemented in the vasp code @xcite , relaxing both the atomic positions and lattice parameters .",
    "a plane - wave cutoff energy of 530 ev and a residual force criterion of 0.02 ev /   are used together with a monkhorst - pack @xmath20 k - mesh .",

    "have been tested . for @xmath23",
    "ev the density of states is found to be in good agreement with the experiment @xcite , whereas for @xmath21 ev states of the ca@xmath3coo@xmath0 subsystem appear at the fermi energy .",
    "it turns out that the self - consistent solution depends critically on the initial value of the co magnetic moment .",

    "case no substantial magnetic moments are formed in the coo@xmath3 subsystem , and the total energy is strongly reduced .",
    "thus , only this case is further addressed .",
    "both 2% and 4% compressive and 2% tensile volumetric strain are studied , for which the atomic positions are re - relaxed , respectively .",
    "precise electronic structures are obtained by the wien2k @xcite code using @xmath25 ev and @xmath26 ev .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is set to 8 , with @xmath28 , and 320 k - points are considered in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone .",
    "the transport properties are calculated using semi - classical boltzmann theory , as implemented in the boltztrap code @xcite , employing 2000 k - points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone .",
    "we expect this procedure of calculating the transport coefficients to be applicable in the intermediate metallic regime , hence we show results only for @xmath29 larger than 200 k. furthermore , within the present approach , neither the structural change near 400 k @xcite nor the spin state transition above 600 k @xcite is covered .",
    "the density of states in the top row of fig .  [ dos ] ( left ) shows that only the spin up co @xmath14 states of the coo@xmath3 subsystem contribute at the fermi energy , in agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "according to the orbitally projected densities of states these contributions are mainly due to the @xmath30 ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ) orbitals .",
    "[ dos ] ( left ) qualitatively agrees with the findings of ref .  ;",
    "minor deviations can be attributed to the different computational schemes employed .",

    "we note that the conductivity is enhanced in the @xmath8-@xmath9 plane ( average of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 components ) .",
    "a maximal conductivity is achieved around 400 k. positive values of the seebeck coefficient reflect a hole character of the majority charge carriers . in the @xmath8-@xmath9 plane",
    "the seebeck coefficient increases with temperature and starts saturating around 400 k , which agrees well with the experiment @xcite , whereas the @xmath34 component does not saturate . at 300 k",
    "we find for the total seebeck coefficient ( average of the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath34 components ) a value close to 60 @xmath39v / k , whereas in refs .   and values of 47 @xmath39v / k and 227 @xmath39v / k , respectively , were predicted ; and measurements result in 135 @xmath39v / k @xcite .",

    "the densities of states obtained for strained cco are shown in fig .  [ dos ] , for 2% tensile strain in the middle part , and 2% compressive volumetric strain in the right part of the figure , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "similar to the unstrained system , only the spin up co @xmath14 states of the coo@xmath3 subsystem contribute at the fermi energy , while the ca@xmath3coo@xmath0 subsystem gives essentially no contributions at all .",
    "the same applies to the case of 4% compressive volumetric strain ( not shown ) .",
    "the strained systems reproduce the gross features of the unstrained system , except for a shift of the spin down conduction band towards the fermi energy for increasing compressive strain .",
    "the electrical conductivity increases slightly with increasing compressive strain , see fig .  [ transport ] .",
    "the overall behaviors of the seebeck coefficient and power factor as functions of the temperature do not change under compressive strain , but the values clearly decrease , particularly for the @xmath8-@xmath9 plane .",
    "interestingly , under tensile strain the electrical conductivity decreases significantly ( because of an energetic shift and enhanced localization of the co @xmath14 states of the coo@xmath3 subsystem at the fermi energy , see fig .",
    "[ dos ] ( middle ) ) , while the in - plane seebeck coefficient increases at high temperature .",
    "the total seebeck coefficient increases at high temperature more strongly than under compressive strain but less than for the unstrained case .",
    "however , the decrease of the electrical conductivity leads to a decrease of the power factor under tensile strain .",
    "a strong anisotropy in the seebeck coefficient in the @xmath8-@xmath9 plane is apparent .",
    "the overall behavior of the thermal conductivity as function of strain is similar to the conductivity , except that @xmath42 increases approximately linearly in @xmath29 .",
    "it has been demonstrated for various substrates that first a rocksalt ca@xmath3coo@xmath0 buffer layer of up to 25 nm thickness is formed before the growth of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 sets in @xcite .",
    "the effect is stronger on ( 001)-oriented perovskite substrates than on hexagonal sapphire substrates , where the buffer layer extends only over few nm .",
    "next to the buffer layer still many coo@xmath3 stacking faults are observed , which are assumed to enhance the phonon scattering and thus the seebeck coefficient in films up to 50 nm thickness @xcite . due to the presence of the buffer layer",
    ", it seems unlikely that the substrate has a strong effect on ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "this point of view is also supported by the lattice parameters obtained from high - resolution electron microscopy @xcite . however , in order to find out if in - plane strain from the substrate could have any positive effect on the thermoelectric performance , we study in the following a representative case , srtio@xmath0 , explicitly .",
    "lattice parameter assuming 20% and 17% compression , respectively , for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 lattice parameters.,scaledwidth=32.0% ]    .,scaledwidth=32.0% ]    to this aim , we strain the ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 supercell by forcing both the @xmath8 and @xmath9 lattice parameters ( original values @xmath43   and @xmath44  ) to the lattice parameter of srtio@xmath0 ( 3.905   and @xmath45  ) .",
    "this corresponds to rather strong compressions of 20% for @xmath8 and 17% for @xmath9 .",
    "we then optimize the @xmath15 lattice parameter relaxing the atomic positions , see fig .",
    "[ optimum ] , and obtain an expansion of 16% to 12.45  . due to the strong distortions",
    "the densities of states in fig .",
    "[ dos - sto ] show significant differences compared to fig .",
    "[ dos ] ( right ) .",
    "the consequences for the thermoelectric properties are demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ transport ] by pink lines . as expected from the strong compression , the electrical and thermal conductivities increase , whereas the seebeck coefficient and the power factor show no improvement over the unstrained material for most temperatures .",
    "these results indicate that ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 samples are not intrinsically strained and that such strain even would not be fruitful .",
    "though it is computationally very demanding , a simulation of stacking faults could give further insights .",
    "in this work we have determined , on the basis of a dft+@xmath16 calculation which predicts a metallic ground state for the misfit cobaltate ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 , the temperature dependence of the thermoelectric transport coefficients in the constant - relaxation - time approximation .",
    "we studied the pristine system ( i.e. , the 5/3 rational approximation ) as well as its behavior under tensile and compressive strain .",
    "the results are expected to be applicable for not too low temperature , @xmath46 k. in order to explain the measured room - temperature resistivity @xcite , we have chosen the relaxation time to be given by @xmath38 s , slightly smaller than the value used in ref .",
    ", @xmath47 s. expressed in a different way , we find @xmath48 to be given by @xmath49 @xmath50 , which is by about a factor of four larger than the corresponding value of lemal et al .",
    "note , however , that the reported resistivities vary considerably , ranging from @xmath51 for single crystals @xcite to @xmath52 @xmath36 for thin films fabricated on an lao substrate using the pld technique @xcite .",
    "another group , also using pld but on ( 001)-silicon with a thin epitaxial yttria - stabilized zirconia ( ysz ) buffer layer , reports @xmath53 @xmath36 , depending on the microstructure @xcite .",
    "clearly these results indicate a strong dependence of transport properties on the growth conditions and the choice of substrate .",
    "( note that we discuss in this paragraph only in - plane transport at room temperature . )",
    "finally we note that the conductivities found in cco are considerably smaller than what is observed for other layered compounds , e.g. , the delafossites pdcoo@xmath3 and ptcoo@xmath3 @xcite , which might raise questions concerning the applicability of boltzmann transport theory and/or the constant - relaxation - time approximation .",
    "in this context we also recall the simple fact that @xmath54 results in @xmath55 @xmath56 which , naively speaking , would imply a considerable linewidth , comparable to the relevant energy scales in the density of states discussed above , in the electronic green s functions . in our opinion , this clearly indicates that not all aspects of transport in cco are sufficiently well understood .",
    "luckily , the relaxation time cancels in the expression of the thermopower  but , even on the boltzmann equation level , only in the simplest approximation .",
