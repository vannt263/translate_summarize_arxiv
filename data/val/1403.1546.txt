    "since its origins , the new science of complex networks has been primarily driven by the need to characterize the properties of real - world systems  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of new ideas and concepts in the field has been very often associated to the availability of new , more accurate , or larger data sets , and to the discovery of new structural properties of complex systems from the real world  @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why a lot of interest has been recently devoted to the study of multiplex networks , i.e. networks in which the same set of nodes can be connected by means of links of qualitatively different type or nature .",
    "several data sets of real - world systems that can be represented and studied as multiplex networks have appeared in the recent literature  @xcite , and we expect that many more will arrive in the next few years . the first papers on the subject have focused on the characterization of the structure of multiplex networks  @xcite , and on modeling the basic mechanisms of their growth  @xcite . in parallel to this , some effort has been also devoted on investigating various kinds of dynamical processes on multiplex topologies , including diffusion  @xcite , epidemic spreading  @xcite , cooperation  @xcite , opinion formation  @xcite , and percolation  @xcite .",
    "there is today a general agreement on the fact that multiplex networks represent the ideal framework to study a large variety of complex systems of different nature .",
    "and there are already some numerical and analytical results showing that the dynamics of processes on multiplex networks is far richer than in networks with a single layer .",
    "a comprehensive review of the main advances in this new vibrant field of research can be found in a few recent survey papers  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we focus on an issue that has revealed of great importance in single - layer networks , but has not yet been investigated thoroughly in multiplex networks , i.e. that of correlations  @xcite . in networks with a single layer it has been found that there are correlations in the properties of connected nodes .",
    "namely , the degree of a node can be either positively or negatively correlated with the degree of its first neighbors . in the first case , the hubs of the networks",
    "are preferentially linked to each others , while in the second case they are preferentially connected to low - degree nodes  @xcite .    in multiplex networks",
    "the very same concept of correlations is far richer than in a network with a single layer .",
    "in fact , on one hand it is still possible to explore the standard degree - degree correlations at the level of each layer of the network , but on the other hand it is more interesting to introduce a truly multiplex definition of correlations , for instance by looking at how a certain property of a node at a given layer is correlated to the same or other properties of the same node at another layer .",
    "we present here a complete and self - consistent study of correlations of node properties in multiplex networks . in doing this , we follow the usual steps of the typical approach to complex networks : _",
    "i ) _ we first explore empirically correlations in real multiplex networks , _ ii ) _ we introduce various measures to characterize and quantify correlations in multiplex networks , _ iii ) _ we propose a series of models to reproduce the correlations found in real multiplex systems , or to assess their relevance .",
    "we find that multiplexity introduces novel levels of complexity .",
    "in particular , in real - world multiplex networks the patterns of presence and involvement of the nodes at the different layers are characterized by strong correlations . and",
    "this has to be taken into account when it comes to model such systems .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ why ] we focus on two small real - world networks and we use them as examples to explain why a description in terms of multiplex networks captures more information on a system than a single - layer projection . in the remaining sections we study the structure of five real - world multiplex networks ( additional information about the networks are provided in appendix ) , with the main attention to the concept of correlations . in particular , in sect .",
    "[ sec : activity ] we focus on the patterns of node activity and involvement at the various layers .",
    "we say that a node is active at a given layer if it has at least one link at that layer , and we introduce various quantities to characterize the distribution and the correlations of node activities .",
    "we also investigate the activity correlations between pairs of layers .",
    "we find that real - world multiplex networks are quite sparse , with only a few nodes active in many layers , and are characterized by strong correlations : interestingly , the activity of a node in a particular layer is very often correlated with its activity in some other layer . in sect .",
    "[ sec : activity_models ] we introduce the first null - models to assess the significance of the observed patterns of node activity . in sect .",
    "[ sec : cartography ] we investigate correlations between the activity and the degree of the nodes of a multiplex network , while in sect .",
    "[ sec : degree - degree ] we show how to quantify inter - layer degree correlations ( degree correlations between layers ) .",
    "in particular , we focus our attention on measuring correlation in the node degrees of a pair of layers , either by using the spearman s rank correlation coefficient of the two degree sequences , or by plotting , as a function of @xmath0 , the average degree @xmath1 at one layer of nodes having degree @xmath0 at the other layer .",
    "we find that there exist significant correlations among the degree of the same node at different layers , and such correlations can be either positive , meaning that nodes tend to have similar roles across layers , or negative , meaning that nodes with a large degree in one layer tend to have small degrees in another layer . finally , in sect.[sec : model_degree - degree",
    "] , we propose two algorithms based on simulated annealing which allow to construct multiplex networks with tunable inter - layer degree - degree correlations , and in sect .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] we report our conclusions .",
    "the details on the five multiplex networks constructed from data sets of biological , technological and social complex systems , and analyzed in the paper , are describe in the appendix .",
    "the networks and the software implementations of the algorithms described in this paper are available at  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to identify , measure and model the different kinds of correlations among node properties which can be found in a multiplex network .",
