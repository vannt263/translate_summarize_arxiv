    "this is specially puzzling in the case of 750 mev@xmath133 where the discrepancy between theory and experiment is very apparent .",
    "polarization data are experimentally very challenging for the @xmath151 and @xmath176 .",
    "these difficulties become obvious when we compare to @xmath150 polarization data from refs .",
    "for @xmath175 we compare to data from @xcite for @xmath177 and @xmath178 mev@xmath133 and we construct the observable from the differential cross section and the polarization observable from the most recent data in @xcite for the closest possible momenta @xmath179 and @xmath165 mev@xmath133 . in this way it is possible to observe the improvement these latest data constitute .",
    "for example , at @xmath180 ( 560 ) mev@xmath133 the forward and backward structures disappear obtaining a flatter distribution and at 719 ( 714 ) and 773 ( 750 ) mev@xmath133 any disagreement between theory and experiment vanishes .",
    "hence , disagreements at 960 and 1285 mev@xmath133 for @xmath80 and at 455 mev@xmath133 for @xmath175 are not worrisome .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath181 reaction is very challenging .",
    "an excellent example of the difficulties is provided by the only two experimental papers in the last 35 years on @xmath182 scattering , which have tried to tackle this reaction , _",
    "i.e. _ manweiler _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and prakhov _ et al .",
    "both analyses have been performed on the same experimental data at eight incident @xmath183 momenta ( @xmath184 , and @xmath165 mev@xmath133 ) reporting overall normalization uncertainties of @xmath185 @xcite and @xmath186 @xcite with serious disagreements on the systematic uncertainties treatment and their results , specially at forward angles .",
    "figure [ fig : p0s01 ] shows a sample of @xmath181 differential cross sections and in particular data from these two analyses at six momenta .",
    "both analyses agree for the lower energies but the discrepancies are very apparent at the higher energies .",
    "this situation gets worse if we compare the polarization results as we do in the first column in fig .",
    "[ fig : p0s02 ] , where they disagree even in the sign of the polarization at every momenta except at 750 mev@xmath133 , which has very large error bars . the ksu single - energy partial waves that we have fitted incorporated the data from @xcite but not the data from @xcite in their extraction .",
    "this explains why our model has better agreement with the polarization data from @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : p0s02 ] we also compare to the @xmath175 from @xcite although the large error bars make difficult any meaningful comparison between theory and experiment . at high energies ,",
    "the differential cross section is not well reproduced as it is obvious from the fourth column in fig .",
    "[ fig : p0s01 ] .",
    "the ksu single - energy partial waves we have fitted do not reproduce these high - energy @xmath181 data , hence we do not expect to reproduce them with our model .    as expected from the results on the total cross section ,",
    "the differential cross sections are systematically underestimated at low energies for the @xmath187 reaction as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : p - s+1 ] .",
    "we underestimate the peak at @xmath188 that shows up for @xmath189 from @xmath190 mev@xmath133 to @xmath191 mev@xmath133 .",
    "the peak shape is generated by the @xmath192 partial wave and its magnitude by its interference with @xmath161 wave . if we compare both partial waves for the @xmath193 channel in the energy range between 2 and 3 gev@xmath104 in figs .",
    "[ fig : pw_s01p01 ] ( @xmath194 row , @xmath195 column ) and [ fig : pw_d05f05 ] ( @xmath194 row , @xmath194 column ) we find that there is a sizable underestimation of the single - energy partial waves by our fits that are responsible for the result we obtain for the differential cross sections .",
    "this explains also the deviation from the @xmath196 data in fig .",
    "[ fig : p - s+2 ] at the same energies ( although polarization data are fairly well reproduced ) .",
    "the rest of the polarization and @xmath196 data are well reproduced considering the large uncertainties and that many experimental data points have unphysical values of @xmath197 .",
    "unfortunately , in the angular region for the polarization data ( @xmath198 ) where the most interesting structure shows up we lack experimental information .    the comparison to @xmath199 differential cross sections is presented in fig .  [ fig : p+s-1 ] .",
    "no polarization data are available for this reaction .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is excellent for all energies and angles except for the forward region at low energies ( see @xmath200 , and @xmath201 mev@xmath133 ) where the reduction of the differential cross section can be achieved through the interference of @xmath202 with higher - order partial waves , however , @xmath162 contribution compensates @xmath202 and @xmath160 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 contribute to the large overestimation shown in the plots .",
    "nevertheless , all the low - energy experimental points come from the same experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite and further independent experimental information would be useful .",
    "we have presented a coupled - channel model for @xmath22 processes in the resonant region ( up to @xmath205 gev@xmath104 ) incorporating all the relevant channels .",
    "the approach presented is based on @xmath20-matrix formalism and breit  wigner parameterizations .",
    "the @xmath75 matrix is analytical , the first riemann sheet has no poles ( at least in a very wide area that envelopes the physical region of interest ) .",
    "unitarity gives the discontinuity of the @xmath75-matrix elements across the right - hand cuts and determines continuation to complex values of @xmath1 below the real axis where resonance poles are located in the unphysical riemann sheets .",
    "analytical amplitudes enable the application of dispersion relations to connect the resonance region with the high - energy domain that is dominated by regge poles in cross - channels , _",
    "e.g. _ in a similar fashion to that used recently in the analysis of @xmath6 scattering @xcite .",
    "the construction of amplitudes valid in a wide range of energies is required in the analysis of processes that have @xmath206 in the final states , _",
    "e.g. _ three - body decays to @xmath207meson in pentaquark searches @xcite and real and quasi - real diffractive photoproduction of @xmath15 pairs on the proton in the search for strangeonia and exotic mesons with hidden strangeness @xcite .    for simplicity and computational reasons",

    "statistical errors have been estimated by means of the bootstrap technique .",
    "in general the fits obtained are very good except for @xmath208 , @xmath160 and @xmath139 partial waves , whose resonance extraction is less reliable than for other partial waves . for these three partial waves we have performed additional analyses on systematic errors by randomly pruning and refitting the data base . due to their nature",
    ", these systematic uncertainties have not been propagated to the resonances or observables error estimation .",
    "we have reported the most comprehensive analysis of the @xmath9 spectrum to date .",
    "all the obtained resonances are summarized in tables [ tab : poles0 ] and [ tab : poles1 ] together with their uncertainties and a comparison to previous pole extractions by zhang _",
    "_ @xcite and kamano _ et al .",
    "we provide graphical representations of the location of the resonances in fig .",
    "[ fig : poles ] ( @xmath75-matrix pole positions in the unphysical riemann sheets ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : polesregge ] ( regge trajectories ) .",
    "the regge trajectories provide additional insight into the nature of the hyperon spectrum .",
    "gaps in the trajectories provide hints on possible missing states and the shape of the trajectories and their ( non-)linearity information on the quark - gluon dynamics @xcite .",
    "we find that most of the states fit within linear trajectories , implying a three - quark state nature .",
    "an exception is the @xmath209 whose mass and width are very well established and does not fit within the daughter natural parity linear regge trajectory .",
    "hence , it is likely that its nature is not that of a three - quark state .",
    "we report a @xmath210 state in the @xmath161 partial wave with a mass of @xmath211 mev and a narrow width of 46 mev that fills in the gap in the parent @xmath212 regge trajectory ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : poles0regge ] ) . a similar @xmath161 state was found in @xcite at @xmath213 mev and @xmath214 mev , although with a model that does not obtain the four - star @xmath215 state also present in the @xmath161 partial wave .",
    "neither present nor @xcite analyses find evidence of the three - star @xmath216 state in the @xmath204 partial wave , however , the structure of the regge trajectories in fig .  [ fig : poles1regge ] suggests that this state is necessary to fill in a gap in the @xmath217 daughter regge trajectory and further studies are mandatory .",
    "finally , we have compared our model predictions to the experimental observables for @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 reactions , namely , total and differential cross sections , polarizations and @xmath175 .",
    "the @xmath224 and @xmath225 data are well reproduced and our amplitudes are an adequate input for @xmath207meson decays and @xmath226 partial - wave analyses . the model also provides a general good description for @xmath199 and @xmath150 processes and a not - so - good description of the @xmath187 and @xmath227 reactions depending on the energy range under consideration .",
    "the reasons for discrepancies , database inconsistencies and systematics have been addressed in section [ sec : experiment ] .",
    "the next step in a comprehensive description and analysis of the hyperon spectrum consists on fitting directly the experimental data as done in @xcite bypassing the single - energy partial waves from @xcite .",
    "the partial waves presented in this paper can be used as starting point in the fitting process .",
    "the examination of the experimental database shows how in dire need of new data we are due to discrepancies encountered between different experimental analyses . considering how increasingly important @xmath0 amplitudes are becoming in the data analysis for hadron spectroscopy research programs at lhcb @xcite and jefferson lab @xcite an ambitious experimental program should be seriously considered in the future experimental research programs at hadron beam facilities @xcite .",
