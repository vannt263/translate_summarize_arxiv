    "according to several researchers , the puzzling pseudogap ( pg ) phenomenon in high-@xmath1 superconductors ( htsc ) is caused by some sort of hidden order .",
    "this is supported by the observation of a depression in the density of states at the fermi level , with no order parameter responsible for this depression observed yet @xcite .",
    "rotating antiferromagnetism ( raf ) has been recently proposed as a possible candidate for this hidden order , and several physical quantities have already been calculated within the raf theory ( raft ) with good agreement with available experimental data @xcite .",
    "raf is one of several other proposals for the pg ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "contrary to theories of circulating currents @xcite , raf is based on the concept of an order parameter that has a finite magnitude below a critical temperature but a time - dependent phase @xcite .",
    "note that all the physical quantities that have so far been calculated within raft do not depend on the phase of the order parameter in raf @xcite .",
    "the lack of the time dependence profile for this phase limited however the full understanding of the nature of raf .",
    "the purpose of this work is to calculate this phase as a function of time using a combination of raft and the heisenberg equation .",
    "we show that it varies linearly with time . as a consequence of this time dependence",
    ", raf can be interpreted as a @xmath2 unusual spin wave around a zero local magnetization or as a synchronized larmor - like precession of all the spins in the system . because the phase of this order parameter is time dependent , it was not possible to calculate it in raft alone , which is a mean - field approach .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first in sec .",
    "[ sec2.1 ] we rederive raft using the spin ladder operators , which are necessary for the phase calculation . in sec .",
    "[ sec2.2 ] , we review raft . then in sec .",
    "[ sec2.3 ] we use the heisenberg equation to get the time dependence for the spin ladder operators , which yields the time dependence of the phase of the rotating order parameter . in sec .",
    "[ sec2.4 ] , the interpretation of raf as an unusual @xmath2 spin wave is explained .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "as we are only interested in understanding the nature of the pg phase of htscs in this work , we restrict ourselves to the non superconducting phase .",
    "consider the @xmath3-@xmath4 hubbard model in two dimensions : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 designate summation over nearest and second - nearest neighboring sites , respectively . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are electron hopping energies to nearest and second - nearest neighbors , respectively . because the phase of raf is related to the spin ladder operators , it is useful to rewrite hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) using these operators .",
    "using the spin ladder operator written in second quantization @xmath8 , the onsite coulomb repulsion term @xmath9 can on one hand be cast in the form @xmath10 and on the other hand as @xmath11 . summing and dividing by 2 yields the symmetrized expression @xmath12 .",
    "the latter can be proved by calculating the action of each side of the equality on the possible states @xmath13 due to pauli exclusion principle , and @xmath14 . for our many - body system , sites are neither full nor empty , but are on average occupied by a density smaller than 1 away from half filling .",
    "therefore , the terms @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are responsible for onsite spin - flip excitations , will contribute by lowering energy for the sites that are partially occupied by the same density of spin up and down electrons .",
    "one can decouple this term in mean - field theory using @xmath17 , which leads to a collective behavior for the spin - flips , and the results obtained in this way are the same as in raft @xcite . in this state , a spin flip process at site @xmath18 is simultaneously accompanied by another one at another site @xmath19 ; the occurrence of the spin flips is synchronized .",
    "thermal motion has obviously an effect on this order as it does on conventional orders ; i.e. , above a critical temperature ( identified with the pg temperature ) the spin - flip processes become uncorrelated , leading to the disappearance of the long - range non conventional order .",
    "the spin - flip processes , which are purely quantum , continue to exist even above this critical temperature , but in an incoherent disordered manner .",
    "the occurrence in raft of a second - order phase transition at the pg temperature is consistent with experimental data supporting its existence @xcite .",
    "we rederive raft , which deals with the static part ( magnitude ) of the order parameter @xmath20 , using the spin ladder operators then for the dynamic ( phase ) part we will use the heisenberg equation to find its time dependence . to the best of our knowledge the combination of mean - field theory and the heisenberg equation of quantum mechanics constitutes a novel approach for the pg in htscs .    the parameter latexmath:[$q_i={\\langle c_{i,\\uparrow}c^{\\dag}_{i,\\downarrow}\\rangle } = -\\langle s_i^-\\rangle \\equiv    of the @xmath3-@xmath4 hubbard model .",
    "consider the ansatz where @xmath22 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 labeling any two adjacent lattice sites . except for this difference of @xmath23 between the phases of the order parameter on two adjacent sites , the phases @xmath24 are site independent and assume any value in @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the normal state hamiltonian in raft @xcite is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of sites , and @xmath28 is the expectation value of the number operator . because of antiferromagnetic correlations the lattice consists of two sublattices @xmath29 and @xmath30 , even though there is no long - range static antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the summation runs over the reduced brillouin zone ( rbz ) .",
    "the nambu spinor is @xmath31 , and the hamiltonian matrix is @xmath32 yielding the energy spectra @xmath33 where @xmath34 \\cr % & & + 4t_5\\cos(2k_x)\\cos(2k_y ) % + 4t_6[\\cos k_x\\cos(3k_y ) + \\cos(3k_x)\\cos k_y ] ; $ ] , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 \\cr % & & -2t_4[\\cos(3k_x ) + \\cos(3k_y ) ] ; $ ] . because the energy spectra @xmath37 do not depend on the phase @xmath38 one should be able to transform @xmath39 to a matrix that does not depend on the phase",
    "this can indeed be done using the spin - dependent gauge transformation @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this transformation is equivalent to performing a rotation by angle @xmath42 about the @xmath43 axis for the @xmath44 and @xmath45 components of the spin operator .",
    "indeed , upon using this gauge transformation , the spin ladder operators transform according to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which yields : @xmath48 the thermal averages of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are given by @xmath51 note that @xmath52 for @xmath18 in both sublattices . because the phase @xmath38 assumes any value between @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( see below ) , rotational symmetry will not look broken for times greater than the period of rotation .",
    "however if the typical time scale of a probe is much smaller than this period symmetry may appear broken .",
    "the magnitude @xmath55 , which was calculated using the minimization of the mean - field free energy @xcite , behaves as in a second - order phase transition in agreement with experimental evidence in @xcite .",
    "next we calculate the phase using the heisenberg equation @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "we consider the limit where electron hopping is neglected in comparison to @xmath57 .",
    "the limit considered here is @xmath58-@xmath59 ; this is an intermediate coupling limit where @xmath60 but smaller than the bandwidth @xmath61 when @xmath62 .",
    "it is justified to use this approximation because spin dynamics is faster than charge dynamics ; i.e. , an onsite spin flip needs a time @xmath63 to be realized , while a charge hopping between adjacent sites takes a longer time @xmath64 , ( @xmath60 ) . in the heisenberg equation",
    "the undecoupled interaction is used instead of raft s hamiltonian ( [ raft hamiltonian ] ) in order to treat as best as possible quantum fluctuations . to carry on the calculation",
    ", we keep in mind that any site @xmath19 is on average only partially occupied , and that @xmath65 . for this reason , terms like @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    "should be kept until the end ( these terms normally give zero when acting on a spin up state , but a nonzero contribution is expected when applied to a partially occupied state where thermal averages are meaningful and suitable ) . in the commutator of the heisenberg equation @xmath68\\approx -\\frac{u}{2}[s_j^+,(s_j^+s_j^- + s_j^-s_j^+)]$ ] , we need to calculate @xmath69=[s_j^+,s_j^+s_j^- ]   + [ s_j^+,s_j^-s_j^+]=2\\hbar(s_j^+s_j^z + s_j^zs_j^+)$ ] . using the fundamental commutation relation @xmath70=\\hbar s_j^+$ ] , one gets @xmath71 , which leads to @xmath72 again we stress that this equation is obtained in the intermediate coupling limit ( @xmath73 smaller than the bandwidth but higher than hopping energies ) , where spin dynamics is not governed by the heisenberg exchange coupling @xmath74 suitable for the strong coupling limit .",
    "( [ heisenberg eq ] ) gives zero when acting on state @xmath75 or @xmath76 .",
    "however , for a collective state where any site is only partially occupied , one has to take the thermal average of eq .",
    "( [ heisenberg eq ] ) .",
    "one then replaces @xmath77 by its raft s thermal average , which is zero . integrating eq .",
    "( [ heisenberg eq ] ) gives for the thermal average @xmath78 which yields @xmath79 modulo @xmath54 when @xmath80 is identified with @xmath81 , ( @xmath82 ) , for sublattice @xmath29 , ( @xmath30 ) , and @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "the angular frequency is thus @xmath85 , and period @xmath86 is the time required to perform a spin - flip process , or the time needed for the rotating order parameter @xmath87 to complete a @xmath54 revolution in a classical point of view .",
    "the magnetic configuration ( [ mag config ] ) takes on the following form @xmath88 , @xmath89 for @xmath18 in sublattice @xmath29 or @xmath90 , @xmath91 for @xmath18 in sublattice @xmath30 , and @xmath92 for @xmath18 in sublattice @xmath29 or @xmath30 .      to illustrate well rotating magnetic order , consider first the much simpler example of the time evolution of a single spin in a magnetic field @xmath30 along the @xmath43-axis , with the initial state given for a spin pointing in the positive @xmath44-direction by @xmath93 .",
    "the time - dependent expectation values of the spin components are @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , with @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath98 and @xmath99 are the charge and mass of the electron , respectively , and @xmath100 is the speed of light .",
    "classically speaking , the spin is confined to rotate about the @xmath43-axis in the @xmath101 plane with larmor angular frequency @xmath102 .",
    "a rotating ferromagnetic state can be realized by placing @xmath27 such states with the same frequency on a lattice made of @xmath27 sites . for a rotating antiferromagetic state ,",
    "opposite initial states ( @xmath103 : spins point in opposite directions on the @xmath44-axis ) are required on each two adjacent sites of the lattice . to relate raf to spin flip processes , we note that @xmath104 in this example .",
    "note that in this example is model independent , which may indicate that all model parameters will do is changing multiplying physical factors , not the physics itself . in a given model ,",
    "a coupling is necessary for providing the building bloc for raf , which is the precession of a spin ( with no local magnetization ) for each lattice site .",
    "the raf state constructed in this way shows a hidden order that can be realized even at finite temperature without violating the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite .",
    "the example above allows us to interpret raf as a state where spins precess collectively in a synchronized manner in the spins @xmath101 plane around an effective staggered magnetic field @xmath105 caused by onsite coulomb repulsion . for our many - body system , @xmath106 in @xmath107",
    "is replaced by the magnitude of the raf order parameter @xmath55 , which can assume values smaller than @xmath108 due to thermal averaging . this state is strongly doping dependent .",
    "when doping increases , @xmath55 rapidly decreases then vanishes at a doping identified as the quantum critical point underneath the superconducting dome @xcite . in comparison to ordinary spin waves in an antiferromagnet ,",
    "raf s state could be viewed as a @xmath0 spin wave in an antiferromagnet with zero magnetization .",
    "note however that for our system ( where @xmath52 ) , spin - wave theory is not applicable because the spin - wave theory is built around a stable nonzero @xmath109 state .",
    "the rotating antiferromagnetism theory and heisenberg equation are combined in order to calculate the phase of the rotating order parameter .",
    "this phase behaves linearly in time .",
    "this allows us to interpret rotating antiferromagnetism in terms of a larmor - like spin precession about an effective magnetic field , which is proportional to onsite coulomb repulsion .",
    "another way to see rotating antiferromagnetism is as an unusual spin - wave at @xmath0 around a zero magnetization .",
    "this work was necessary for unveiling the nature of rotating antiferromagnetism , which has been proposed for explaining the pseudogap behavior in high-@xmath1 materials .",
    "rotating antiferromagnetic order is an example of hidden order , which is a serious candidate for the pg state in htscs .",
    "this is supported by the good success of the rotating antiferromagnetism theory in the calculation of thermodynamics @xcite , optical conductivity @xcite , raman @xcite , and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy properties @xcite .",
