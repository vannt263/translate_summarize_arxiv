    "the supernova cosmology is based on the well - known hubble diagram ( hd ) in which distances of sne  ia are represented as a function of their redshifts , @xmath1 , usually determined with high accuracy from sne  ia or host galaxies spectra .",

    "@xcite , and @xcite found a correlation between the properties of the sn  ia light curve ( lc ) and the absolute magnitude in its maximum for @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands .",

    "however , the sne  ia methodology is calibrated on local objects , whose host galaxies probably share almost solar abundances , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 being the solar values @xcite . ] . but chemical abundances change with redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) due to chemical evolution of galaxies , therefore the lc calibration might not be the same for chemical abundances which differ very much from solar values . this possible metallicity dependence of the sne  ia luminosity has been neglected but it might play a role in accurately determining the distances to cosmological sne  ia .",
    "since the number of sne  ia detections will extraordinarily increase in the forthcoming surveys ( des , lsst ) , statistical errors will decrease while systematic errors will begin to dominate , limiting the precision of sne  ia as indicators of extragalactic distances .",

    "the wd approaches the critical chandrasekhar mass by accretion from its companion .",
    "the maximum luminosity of a sn  ia depends on the amount of @xmath9ni synthesized during the explosion @xcite : @xmath10 assuming the mass of the exploding wd is constant , the parameter who leads the relation between the lc parameters and its maximum magnitude is the outer layer opacity of the ejected material @xcite , which depends on temperature and , thus , on the heating due to the radioactive @xmath11 decay .",
    "the neutron excess in the exploding wd , which controls the radioactive ( @xmath11 ) to non - radioactive ( fe - peak elements ) abundance ratio , depends directly on the initial metallicity of the progenitor .",

    "a linear fit applied to these points results in : @xmath64 this fit has a correlation coefficient @xmath33=0.5 , and considering the errors of the fit parameters , a no correlation is equally valid or statistically significant .",

    "yields : @xmath68 this would have an impact on the hd of cosmological models . since magnitudes estimated by the color and lc parameters provide higher luminosities at high metallicities than they really are , some residuals with a positive slope will be induced in the hd when comparing the luminosity of the sn  ia and the oxygen abundance ( or any other metallicity proxy , as the stellar mass following the mass - metallicity relation ) .",
