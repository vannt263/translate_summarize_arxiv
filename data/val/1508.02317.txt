    "cosmic strings exist as solutions of the field equations in many particle physics models beyond the standard model .",
    "a sufficient criterion is that the vacuum manifold @xmath6 of the model ( the space of field configurations which minimize the potential energy density ) has non - vanishing first homotopy group @xmath71 . roughly speaking",
    "the condition is that the vacuum manifold has the topology of a circle .",
    "a simple causality argument @xcite leads to the important conclusion that in models which admit cosmic string solutions , a network of such strings inevitably forms during the symmetry breaking phase transition in the early universe and survives to the present time ( see @xcite for reviews of the role of cosmic strings in cosmology ) .",
    "cosmic strings carry energy and hence induce gravitational effects which can lead to signatures in cosmological observations .",
    "the strength of these effects is proportional to the string tension @xmath8 which in turn is given ( up to a numerical constant ) by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the scale of symmetry breaking at which the strings are formed .",
    "hence , searching for cosmic strings in cosmological observations is a way to probe particle physics beyond the _ standard model _ which is complementary to accelerator searches ( which can only probe new physics at low energy scales ) .    based on analytical arguments @xcite",
    "it is expected that the distribution of cosmic strings will take on a `` scaling solution '' according to which the statistical properties of the distribution of strings are independent of time if all lengths are scaled to the hubble radius @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the cosmic expansion rate at time @xmath13 ) .",
    "the distribution of strings consists of a network of infinite strings with mean curvature radius and separation @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is a constant of order one whose precise value needs to be determined in numerical simulations ) and a set of string loops which are the remnants of intersections of long string segments .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite have confirmed that the distribution of strings takes on a scaling solution .",
    "string loops oscillate and gradually decay by emitting gravitational radiation .",
    "long string segments moving through the plasma of the early universe will lead to nonlinear overdensities in the plane behind the moving string . these are called string _",
    "wakes _ @xcite .",
    "wakes are formed because the geometry of space perpendicular to a long string segment is conical with deficit angle = 8 g , where @xmath16 is newton s gravitational constant @xcite .",
    "a string moving through the plasma with a velocity @xmath17 perpendicular to the tangent vector of the string will lead to a velocity perturbation v = 4 g v ( v ) from both sides towards the plane behind the moving string ( where @xmath18 is the relativistic gamma factor associated with the velocity @xmath17 ) . in turn , this leads to a thin region behind the string with twice the background density , the _",
    "wake_. the dimensions of the wake behind a string at time @xmath19 are [ dims ] c_1 t_i v ( v ) t_i 4 g v ( v ) t_i , where the dimensions are length along the string , depth of the wake in direction of string motion , and mean thickness of the wake , respectively .",
    "we will denote these dimensions by @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , when using comoving coordinates .",
    "cosmic string loops accrete matter in a rougly spherical way and give rise to density fluctuations which are hard to tell apart from fluctuations formed by other point sources .",
    "string wakes , on the other hand , give rise to signals with a clear geometrical signature , and have hence been the focus of a lot of recent work ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "long cosmic string segments produce line discontinuities in cmb ( cosmic microwave background ) temperature maps @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the power spectrum of cosmological perturbations is scale - invariant @xcite .",
    "however , the fluctuations are active and incoherent @xcite and hence do not lead to acoustic oscillations in the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies . at the present time , the angular cmb power spectrum in fact provides the most robust upper bounds on the string tension @xcite ( see the introduction of  @xcite for a more detailed discussion on string tension limits as well as @xcite for earlier studies ) g < 1.3 10 ^ -7 .",
    "hence , it follows that cosmic strings are only a sub - dominant component to the power spectrum of perturbations .",
    "the dominant contribution must be due to almost gaussian and almost adiabatic fluctuations such as those produced by inflation ( or by alternatives to inflation such as _ string gas cosmology _",
    "@xcite or the _ matter bounce _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "whereas overall cosmic strings are a sub - dominant component to structure formation , string wakes can nevertheless give rise to prominent signatures in position space maps .",
    "they give rise to a network of edges in cmb temperature maps across which the temperature jumps @xcite , rectangles in the sky with a specific cmb polarization signal ( statistically equal e - mode and b - mode polarization with a polarization angle which is uniform over the rectangle and whose amplitude has a linear gradient @xcite ) , and thin wedges of extra absorption or emission in 21 cm redshift maps @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these features are most prominent at high redshifts when string wakes are already nonlinear fluctuations but the gaussian fluctuations are still in their linear regime .",
    "the cosmic string signals are also most easily visible in position space maps ( e.g. with edge detection algorithms @xcite ) , whereas the distincitve stringy features are washed out in power spectra ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    at early times , cosmic strings",
    "dominate the nonlinearities in the universe , the reason being that wakes are nonlinear perturbations beginning at the time they are formed , whereas gaussian perturbations are linear at early times . at late times , however , the gaussian fluctuations dominate the structure in the universe .",
    "most of the nonlinearities at the present time are due to the gaussian fluctuations .",
    "the question we wish to address in this paper is whether the string - induced inhomogeneities , which at early times are clearly visible , are still observable as coherent objects in position space maps at later times ( in particular times after reionization ) .",
    "concretely , we wish to study whether string wakes will remain coherent or whether they are disrupted by the gaussian fluctuations .",
    "this analysis is a crucial preliminary step towards identifying string signals at low redshifts , e.g. in 21 cm redshift maps at redshifts comparable and smaller than the redshift or reionization , or in large - scale structure redshift surveys .    in this paper",
    "we study various stability criteria for string wakes .",
    "we study the stability of a wake to local disruption and find the redshift above which a cosmic string wake remains locally intact , as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "however , even if gaussian fluctuations cause the wake to be locally disrupted , a global signal may remain .",
    "we study a specific criterion which can be used to search for the signals of primordial wakes .",
    "this analysis shows that signals of string wakes remain from a global perspective to the present time .",
    "interestingly , the signals can be identified independently of the value of @xmath5 , and do not depend on whether the wakes are shock - heated or diffuse ( see @xcite for a discussion of the difference between these two cases ) .",
    "our various stability criteria will be relevant for developing robust observational strategies to search for string wakes .    in the following section we give a brief review of cosmic string wakes . in section 3 we present a local stability condition based on a _",
    "displacement condition_. in section 4 we consider a local density contrast consideration .",
    "the resulting stability condition shows that wakes are locally disrupted by the gaussian perturbations at a redshift lower than some critical redshift which depends on @xmath5 . in section 5",
    "we discuss a global stability condition which shows that wakes are visible up to the present time independent of the value of @xmath5 .",
    "consider a string segment at time @xmath19 moving with velocity @xmath17 in direction perpendicular to the string .",
    "this segment will produce an overdense region with twice the background density behind it whose dimensions are given by ( [ dims ] ) . once formed , this wake will be stretched in the planar directions by the expansion of space , and it will grow in thickness by accreting matter from above and below .",
    "this accretion can be studied using the zeldovich approximation @xcite .",
    "we will consider wakes produced at times @xmath23 , where @xmath4 is the time of equal matter and radiation .",
    "those produced earlier can not grow until @xmath4 and they will be hence be smaller .",
    "the thickness of the wake at time @xmath24 is determined by computing the comoving distance @xmath25 of a shell of matter which is starting to collapse ( `` turning around '' ) onto the wake , i.e. for which ( q_nl(t ) , t ) = 0 , where the physical height is given by h(q , t ) = a(t ) , where @xmath26 is the cosmological scale factor and @xmath27 is the comoving displacement induced by the gravity of the wake . a standard calculation",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) yields [ turn ] q_nl(t , t_i ) = ( z(t ) + 1)^-1   v ( v ) g ( z(t_i ) + 1)^1/2 t_0 , where @xmath28 is the cosmological redshift at time @xmath13 and @xmath29 is the present time . at the turnaround @xmath30 . after turnaround ,",
    "the shell of baryonic matter virializes at a distance which is half of the turnaround radius , whereas the dark matter remains extended @xcite .",
    "hence , the physical height of the dark matter wake at time @xmath13 is [ thick ] h(t , t_i ) = ( z(t ) + 1)^-1  q_nl(t , t_i ) .",
    "this is also the displacement which a particle experiences due to the wake if this particle ends up at the edge of the wake .",
    "we also denote the wake thickness in comoving coordinates by _ 3(z ) = 10 ^ -7(g)_7 v ( v ) t_0 [ eq : psi ] , where @xmath31 is the value of @xmath5 in units of @xmath32 .",
    "the result ( [ thick ] ) shows that the thickest wakes are those produced at the earliest times , namely @xmath33 .",
    "the thickness of a wake is obviously proportional to @xmath5 , and its comoving size grows linearly in the cosmological scale factor @xmath26 , as expected from linear cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "in this section we will obtain a stability condition which is based on displacements induced by primordial gaussian fluctuations . for simplicity we will restrict the analysis of this section to the matter dominated period . in the next section",
    "we will extend the validity range to include dark energy in the evolution of the growth factor .",
    "the wake plane ( formed by the @xmath20 and @xmath21 lengths ) can be subdivided into pieces of area @xmath34 , where @xmath22 is the thickness of the wake in comoving coordinates .",
    "we will compute the displacement ( in a direction perpendicular to the wake plane ) which is coherent on this scale . in order to do this",
    "we will integrate in time the fluctuation of the peculiar velocity field on the scale @xmath22 .    if @xmath35 is the induced physical displacement , then s__3(t ) < h(t , t_i ) [ eq : displcond ] is a local displacement condition for the stability of the wake . to compute @xmath36",
    "consider the continuity equation + = 0 , where @xmath37 is the relative matter density contrast and @xmath38 is the physical peculiar velocity field .",
    "choosing a fourier mode parallel to @xmath38 and taking the modulus of the fourier transform of the above equation we obtain a relation between the amplitudes of the velocity and density contrast fields in momentum space : v_k(z ) = _ k(z)where we used @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the growth factor @xcite .",
    "for the matter dominated period , @xmath42 and the function @xmath43 is approximately one .",
    "the contribution to the standard deviation of the peculiar velocity field on a scale @xmath44 at redshift @xmath45 is denoted by @xmath46 and from the above equation we obtain _",
    "v(k , z ) = a h ( ) ( k , z ) , where ( k , z ) [ eq : deltasq ] is the dimensionless contribution to the standard deviation of the matter density fluctuations @xmath37 on a length scale corresponding to @xmath47 , given the dimensional power spectrum @xmath48 at redshift @xmath45 .",
    "the induced physical displacement @xmath36 is given by s_l ( z ) = a ^z_z_i a^-1 ( t^ ) _",
    "v(k , z(t^ ) ) dt^ evaluated at @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the wavenumber associated with the comoving thickness @xmath51 of the wake .",
    "the integral will be dominated by the upper limit of integration , therefore s__3 = a(_3(z),z ) , and the displacement condition ( [ eq : displcond ] ) becomes ( k_3 ( z),z ) < 2 . when the above equation holds , the coherent displacement in a region perpendicular to the wake plane will be smaller than the wake thickness @xmath22 .",
    "this displacement condition agrees to within one order of magnitude with the local delta condition of the next section and gives a physical interpretation to it .",
    "the above condition is valid during the matter dominated period , but in the next section this restriction will be extended to include the dark energy period .",
    "another criterium for the stability of a wake can be obtained by demanding that the r.m.s .",
    "gaussian mass fluctuations @xmath52 on the scale @xmath53 of the wake thickness is smaller than unity , i.e. ( k_3(z),z ) < 1 .",
    "[ eq : rmscond ] we call ( [ eq : rmscond ] ) the `` local delta condition '' .",
    "if this condition is satisfied then the wake is locally stable .",
    "this condition can be justified by noticing that the matter density contrast @xmath37 in a volume within the wake fluctuates around 1 inside the wake and around zero outside , so if the standard deviation @xmath54 of @xmath37 is of order one the wake matter signal will be lost .",
    "the late time power spectrum is obtained by multiplying the primordial power spectrum by the square of a _ transfer function _",
    "@xmath55 which comes from the non - trivial evolution of fluctuations on sub - hubble scales . specifically , for scales which enter the hubble radius before the redshift @xmath56 of equal matter and radiation the fluctuations in matter on sub - hubble scales grow only logarithmically since the universe is dominated by a smooth radiation fluid at these times and on these scales .",
    "the late time power spectrum for a model with gaussian fluctuations with fixed spectral index is obtained from ( @xcite , page 184 ) p(k , z ) = 2 ^ 2_h^2 t^2(k ) g^2(z ) [ eq : powspec ] where we use the expression given by @xcite in the growth factor , which now includes dark energy , @xmath57 is the transfer function , @xmath58 is the scalar spectral index , and @xmath59 is the amplitude of @xmath52 evaluated for a fourier mode that corresponds to the hubble scale .",

    "we will also use @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70    the transfer function @xmath55 from ( @xcite page 60 ) is used to obtain an analytic expression for @xmath71 , which together with the approximation @xmath72 gives [ result2 ] ( k_3(z),z ) = 0.607 ( 1 + 22.7 k_3(z))g(z ) .",

    "our result ( [ global2 ] ) lets us draw important conclusions .",
    "most importantly , the global delta criterium ( [ global0 ] ) is independent of the thickness of the wake , and hence independent of the string tension @xmath5 .",
