    "dwarf irregular ( dim ) galaxies , like many disk systems , often have neutral atomic hydrogen gas that extends beyond , and sometimes well beyond , the optical galaxy . in extreme cases",
    "this gas is known to extend 37 times farther than the stellar distributions ( huchtmeier et al .",
    "1981 , bajaja et al .  1994 ) .",
    "such envelopes were believed to be relatively quiescent reservoirs of gas , as there was little data to the contrary .",
    "this changed with very large array ( vla ) mosaics of ngc 4449 ( hunter et al .",
    "1998 ) and ic 10 ( shostak & skillman 1989 , wilcots & miller 1999 ) .",
    "ngc 4449 is surrounded by a complex network of streamers that represents the remains of an h@xmath0i  disk disrupted by an encounter with another galaxy ( hunter et al .",
    "1998 , theis & kohle 1998 ) .",
    "ic 10 is embedded in a counter - rotating halo of h@xmath0i  and also appears to be currently accreting a large cloud of gas ( wilcots & miller 1998 ) .",
    "on the other hand , some dwarfs _ are _ embedded in large , quiescent disks that are simply smooth extensions of the galaxy that happen to stretch some 57 times farther than the stars ( carignan & purton 1998 ; kreckel et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "we do not yet understand how some irregulars have maintained extremely large quiescent disks , especially given the onslaught of activity and ionization in the early universe ( ricotti et al .",
    "similarly , it is not yet clear what role the extended gas around irregulars plays in the evolution of the stellar disk . also , the extended gas is more sensitive to interactions with other galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to determine the full extent of h@xmath0i  distributions around galaxies .",
    "one galaxy with a potentially large smooth extension of gas is the dwarf irregular sextans a. single dish maps of sextans a by huchtmeier et al .",
    "( 1981 ) with the effelsberg 100 m telescope showed h@xmath0i  extending to a diameter of 54at a column density of 10@xmath4 atoms @xmath2 .",
    "thus , h@xmath0i  was detected to 8.7 times the galaxy s optically - defined holmberg diameter .",
    "this motivated wilcots & hunter ( 2002 ) to map sextans a in h@xmath0i  using the vla in a mosaic that covered 90  diameter at 1  resolution ( see also , barnes & de blok 2004 ) .",
    "although those observations reached a column density of @xmath5 atoms @xmath2 , h@xmath0i  was only detected to a diameter of 18 , about one - third of the extent reported by huchtmeier et al .",
    ", and only about 62% of the total h@xmath0i  flux reported by huchtmeier et al .  was recovered .",
    "wilcots and hunter suggested that the missing gas exists in a very smooth , low column density distribution with a size scale too large to be resolved with the interferometer .",
    "they estimated that the density fluctuations in this extended gas should be no smaller than 1015  to be hidden from the vla .",
    "if the extended gas around sextans a is indeed that smooth , it is a prime target for mapping with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "first , because of its unique design , the gbt has extraordinarily low side lobes : 30 db below the primary beam at 1420 mhz , about 0.1% .",
    "this allows one to detect faint gas far from the center of the galaxy .",
    "second , with a beam - size at 21-cm of 8.7  the gbt would still be able to resolve large - scale structure in the extended gas if it exists .",
    "we , therefore , undertook to use the gbt to map the h@xmath0i  gas around sextans a. our purpose was to use the unparalleled sensitivity of gbt to confirm the existence of the gas at the outer edges of sextans a , determine any structure in the gas , and explore how far it extends and how the density falls off with radius .",
    "two other dwarf galaxies  wlm and ngc 2366have also been reported by huchtmeier et al .",
    "( 1981 ) to have extended h@xmath0i  with diameters that are 3 - 3.6 times their optical holmberg diameters , and this gas has gone undetected by others ( hunter et al .",
    "2001 , barnes & de blok 2004 , jackson et al .",
    "both are fairly typical nearby , gas - rich dim galaxies with modest absolute magnitudes .",
    "these two galaxies were also included in this study .",
    "thus , we have observed three dim galaxies with potentially extended h@xmath0i   disks  sextans a , wlm , and ngc 2366with the gbt , and we report the results of those observations here .",
    "basic properties of the galaxy sample are given in table [ tab - sample ] .",
    "we used the 100 m single - dish gbt with the gbt spectrometer 2829 june 2003 to map the 21-cm h@xmath0i - line emission associated with our three galaxies .",
    "the spectrometer was used in its auto - correlation total - power mode with a 12.5 mhz bandwidth and 9-level sampling mode to yield a channel separation of 0.32 km s@xmath6  and a full spectral coverage of 2595 km s@xmath6 .",
    "our central velocity was the heliocentric radial velocity of the galaxy , given in table [ tab - obs ] .",
    "we observed 3c48 at the beginning of the observing session in order to verify pointing .",
    "the beam - size at our frequencies is about 8.72 , and for most of the mapping we stepped every 2.9 , 1/3 of a beam - size , in order to produce a fully sampled map .",
    "one exception was a portion of the ngc 2366 map to the north that was begun with a step of a 1/2 beam - size .",
    "the other exception was the map of wlm which consists of an east - west strip 3 pointings wide ( one offset 1/3 beam width to the north and one offset 6  to the south ) and a north - south strip through the galaxy center .",
    "the map center , number of pointings , and final field of view of each map is given in table [ tab - obs ] .",
    "we began the map in the center row and worked our way north one row at a time , and then returned to the center and worked our way south .",
    "for sextans a , the last row of the northern part of the map was only partially completed due to time limitations .",
    "we used position switching for calibration and background subtraction , and our reference position was located 40 - 50  north or south , whichever was closer .",
    "we moved to this off position every 5 steps along the map for sextans a and wlm and every 6 steps for ngc 2366 .",
    "we integrated for 1 minute at each position , obtaining 3 spectra of 20 s each and expecting to reach an rms of 0.03 k.    the data were reduced using gbtidl . because we were interested only in a relatively narrow velocity range around the central velocity of the galaxies , we eliminated approximately the first and last 1000 channels in every scan in order to remove noise spikes .",
    "we calibrated each row pointing against the reference scan taken during the observations of that row .",
    "the resulting spectra showed stable , flat baselines .",
    "a few scans had curvy baselines , and those scans were flagged and not used further .",
    "the continuum on each side of the emission line was fit and subtracted to produce a baseline at zero .",
    "we smoothed along the velocity axis with a boxcar average of 5 pixels and proportionally decreased the number of channels in the final spectra .",
    "the final spectra contained 1201 channels for sextans a and ngc 2366 and 1361 channels for wlm with channel widths of 1.61 km s@xmath6 .",
    "we used a standalone program , idltosdfits , to convert the calibrated spectra in gbtidl to a format that mimics radio interferometry uv data and then read those data into aips . within aips we used sdgrd to produce map cubes with 174  pixels .    from the map cubes we made moment zero maps of integrated h@xmath0i  emission .",
    "we integrated over channels 516579 for sextans a , 506594 for ngc 2366 , and 610677 for wlm . in the calibration process in gbtidl",
    ", the gbt data are converted to @xmath7 , antenna temperature corrected for atmospheric attenuation , radiative loss , and rearward scattering and spillover . to convert to @xmath8 , the brightness temperature of the source , we correct for the forward scattering and spillover , @xmath9 , and for the main beam efficiency , @xmath10 . here",
    "we ignore forward scattering and use a typical value for @xmath10 at 1.4 ghz on the gbt of 0.94 so @xmath11 ( braatz 2009 ) .",
    "then for our beam - size and frequency , @xmath12 .",
    "observations of the standard continuum source 3c48 yield a flux that is 6% low .",
    "however , this is within the uncertainty of 10% for 21-cm calibration reported by robishaw & heiles ( 2009 ) .",
    "thus , we expect our fluxes to be uncertain at the 10% level .    in the map cubes ,",
    "the units of k beam@xmath6 pixel@xmath6 can be converted to units of jy by multiplying by a factor of ( pixel scale)@xmath13/beam - size@xmath14/2.02 , which is a factor of 0.054 . for contours on the moment zero ( integrated h@xmath0i ) maps , map units of 15.3 k beam@xmath6 km s@xmath6 pixel@xmath6",
    "correspond to a column density of @xmath1 atoms @xmath2 .",
    "our flux - velocity profiles are shown in figure [ fig - intprofiles ] .",
    "robishaw & heiles ( 2009 ) have reported inaccuracies in 21-cm line profiles measured with the gbt .",
    "they find 10% errors in the calibrated gain and some contributions from distant sidelobes .",
    "although these problems may increase the uncertainties , the profile shapes agree well with those measured with the vla .",
    "we detected h@xmath0i  emission from sextans a between 270 km s@xmath6  to 372 km s@xmath6 .",
    "this is very close to the range of velocities detected by wilcots & hunter ( 2002 ) and huchtmeier et al .",
    "( 1981 ) although their channel spacings of 2.6 km s@xmath6  and 6.6 km s@xmath6 , respectively , were coarser than ours . a galactic high velocity cloud ( hvc ) , identified by huchtmeier et al .",
    ", is also present in the direction of sextans a. we detect it from 110 km s@xmath6  to 152 km s@xmath6 .    our integrated h@xmath0i  map of sextans a is shown in figure [ fig - sexam0 ] and contoured on a @xmath15-band image in figure [ fig - sexahionv ] .",
    "here we summed from 270.5 km s@xmath6to 371.9 km s@xmath6  in the gbt data cube .",
    "the central bright object is sextans a , and we see no other structure in the map .",
    "our 3@xmath16 column density limit in figure [ fig - sexam0 ] is @xmath17 atoms @xmath2 .",
    "this is significantly better than the sensitivity limit of @xmath5 atoms @xmath2  of wilcots & hunter s ( 2002 ) vla data and the @xmath1 atoms @xmath2  limit of huchtmeier et al .",
    "in fact , this is only a little higher than the 3@xmath16 limit of @xmath18 atoms @xmath2  achieved by oosterloo et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in ultra - deep mapping of the extended h@xmath0i  halo around ngc 891 .",
    "masses and h@xmath0i  extents are given in table [ tab - results ] .",
    "we calculate a total h@xmath0i  mass of @xmath19 m_@xmath20 .",
    "this is only 25% more than the mass of @xmath21 m_@xmath20  reported by wilcots & hunter ( 2002 ) , but 78% of the mass detected by huchtmeier et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , all corrected to the distance we are using .",
    "it is immediately clear from figure [ fig - sexam0 ] that there is no large extended skirt of h@xmath0i  around sextans a. figure [ fig - massprofiles ] shows a column density profile constructed from measuring the azimuthally - averaged surface density of the gas in annuli . because the beam - size is so large , the galaxy h@xmath0i  distribution appears largely round .",
    "we used the position angle ( p.a . ) and inclination given in table [ tab - obs ] , and the column densities are corrected for inclination . from the column density profile , we measure h@xmath0i  around sextans a to a diameter of 22.1at a column density of @xmath1 atoms @xmath2 . corrected for the 8.7  beam ,",
    "this is 20.4 .",
    "hunter & wilcots ( 2002 ) reported a diameter of 18   at @xmath5 atoms @xmath2  from their vla observations , and their surface density profile yields a diameter of 15.2  at the level of @xmath1 atoms @xmath2  that we are using for comparison here . in short , we do not detect the extended disk of h@xmath0i  that huchtmeier et al .  reported in 1981 .",
    "wilcots and hunter did not detect this gas with the vla , not because it is extremely smooth , but because it is not there .",
    "with huchtmeier et al.s h@xmath0i  diameter of 54 , the ratio of h@xmath0i  diameter to optical diameter of sextans a was extreme .",
    "figure 13 of hunter ( 1997 ) compiles data on the h@xmath0i  extents of typical irregular galaxies .",
    "that figure is a histogram of the ratio @xmath22 of the radius of h@xmath0i  at @xmath1 atoms @xmath2  to the optical extent as measured by the holmberg radius , defined at a photographic surface brightness of 26.5 mag arcsec@xmath23 .",
    "most irregular galaxies , like most spirals , have a ratio around 2 .",
    "only 6 systems were known at that time to have @xmath22 greater than 3 , with the highest being a ratio of 7 .",
    "sextans a was then thought to have the third highest ratio with a value of 5.8 , with the values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 used at that time . with our new data",
    ", we find that sextans a has an @xmath24 at @xmath1 atoms @xmath2  of 10.2 , and the ratio @xmath22 is 3.3 .",
    "( our @xmath25 are taken from hunter & elmgreen [ 2006 ] and given in table [ tab - sample ] ) .",
    "this now puts sextans a at the high end of the distribution of the bulk of other irregular galaxies and an h@xmath0i  extent that is not particularly abnormal .",
    "where could the discrepancy between the huchtmeier et al .",
    "( 1981 ) effelsberg observations and the gbt observations lie ?",
    "we have replicated as closely as possible the channel maps of sextans a given in figure 3c of huchtmeier et al .  since their velocity resolution is lower than ours , this involved summing over the appropriate channels in the gbt data cube .",
    "these channel maps are shown in figure [ fig - sexakntr ] .",
    "each map is the average of 10 channels and is centered as closely as possible on the same velocities as huchtmeier et al.s channel maps .",
    "figure [ fig - sexakntr ] looks different than figure 3c of huchtmeier et al .",
    "the effelsberg data detect extended h@xmath0i  that does not appear in our maps and the shape of sextans a at the lowest column densities differs .",
    "there are significant differences between the gbt observations and those done at effelsberg that may contribute to differences in the maps .",
    "first , although the beam sizes are nearly the same , huchtmeier et al .",
    "( 1981 ) mapped sextans a every beam - size ( 9 ) , whereas we mapped every 1/3 of a beam ( 2.9 ) .",
    "thus , our map is better sampled .",

    "maps occur at low signal - to - noise .",
    "third , although the gbt does have side - lobe problems ( robishaw & heiles 2009 ) , they are different from those at effelsberg and we believe that the effelsberg map was confusing galactic emission with emission from sextans a. we detect galactic emission at lower velocities , offset about 120 km s@xmath6 .",
    "we detected h@xmath0i  emission from wlm between -179 km s@xmath6  to -71 km s@xmath6 .",
    "similarly , kepley et al .",

    "our integrated h@xmath0i  map of wlm is shown in figure [ fig - wlmm0 ] and contours are superposed on a @xmath15-band image in figure [ fig - wlmhionv ] .",
    "because of limited telescope time , our map consists of a strip through the center along the north - south direction and along the east - west direction .",
    "this was done in order to look for extended emission along two diameters .",
    "thus , the map is not complete and imaging artifacts are obvious .",
    "however , no extended skirt of h@xmath0i  is seen along the two map directions .",

    "since our map is incomplete , we made a simple north - south cut through the center of the galaxy .",
    "this is close to the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "this cut sums east - west over 3 pixels ( 8.7 ) , and is shown in figure [ fig - massprofiles ] .",
    "the distance from the center of the galaxy is positive for the north direction and negative for south . from this cut , we see that a column density of @xmath1 atoms @xmath2  occurs at a radius of 12.9  to the south and 16.4  to the north of the galaxy center .",
    "the average diameter is 29.3 .",
    "corrected for the 8.7  beam , this is 28 , which is comparable to the diameter of 29.3  from the vla observations of kepley et al .",

    "some studies have found abrupt truncations and others have not .",

    "furthermore , the shape of the fall - off is similar among a wide variety of spiral galaxies .",
