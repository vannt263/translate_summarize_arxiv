    "recent cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments @xcite and high - redshift galaxy surveys @xcite are able to probe the primordial density perturbation on cosmological scales , @xmath0  mpc .",
    "this yields a precise measure of the primordial density contrast , @xmath1 for @xmath2  mpc@xmath3 @xcite . for much smaller scales , free - streaming of relativistic particles in the very early universe and silk damping due to photon diffusion",
    "erases the primordial density perturbation on comoving scales much less than 10  mpc  @xcite .",
    "the present distribution of matter on smaller scales is the result of the subsequent non - linear evolution of the matter density and we are unable to directly relate observational data to the primordial distribution of matter .",
    "therefore for modes which are much smaller than 10  mpc the primordial density perturbation remains undetermined .",
    "one might assume that the primordial density perturbation on small scales has the same value as on larger scales . according to wmap 5-year data @xcite the spectral index on cmb scales is smaller than one , @xmath4 ) , implying that the density contrast is slightly smaller on smaller scales , but it is a huge extrapolation to assume that this is the actual scale - dependence all the way from cmb scales down to comoving scales such as @xmath5  pc , for instance , which are smaller than the comoving hubble scale at the epoch of big bang nucleosynthesis , @xmath6  mev .",
    "the only probes of such small scales at early times are expected to be gravitational relics .",
    "one process which allows us to put an upper bound on density perturbations is the formation of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) @xcite .",
    "pbhs are produced when density fluctuations with a large amplitude ( @xmath7 ) enter the horizon .",
    "their typical mass is given by the horizon mass when they were produced @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 which can be related to the temperature if they formed in the radiation dominated era @xmath9 the fact that pbhs have not been observed to date limits the initial mass fraction going into black holes , which can be used to constrain the primordial density perturbation on the corresponding scales @xcite .",
    "for instance pbhs radiate hawking radiation and thus for @xmath10 g evaporations are limited because of constraints from the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , which is sensitive to the baryon - photon ratio at the time , and also because of bounds on the expected gamma - ray background . for heavier pbhs ( @xmath11 g ) , similar constraints come with the fact that the present - day density of pbhs can not exceed the upper limit on the cold dark matter density @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves also give us a window onto density perturbations in the very early universe .",
    "they can be generated by violent events in the early universe such as bubble collisions @xcite , cosmic strings @xcite , preheating after inflation @xcite , or parametric decay of supersymmetric condensates @xcite .",
    "all of these mechanisms are highly model - dependent .",
    "even gravitational waves from produced from vacuum fluctuations of the metric during inflation @xcite , though a generic prediction of inflation , have an amplitude which is dependent upon the energy scale of inflation .    in this paper",
    "we consider the bounds placed on the the primordial density perturbation from the generation of a stochastic background of gravitational waves in the very early universe . in the standard radiation - dominated hot big bang , first - order density perturbations inevitably generate gravitational waves at second ( and higher ) order @xcite . like the initial mass fraction of pbhs ,",
    "the power spectrum of induced gravitational waves is determined by the primordial density perturbation and thus can place bounds on the amplitude of scalar perturbations .",
    "indeed saito and yokoyama @xcite have recently pointed out that current gravitational wave bounds are sufficient to rule out pbhs as possible candidates for intermediate mass black holes .",
    "if we could determine the amplitude and frequency of these induced gravitational waves then we would be able to determine the primordial density perturbation when the corresponding scales crossed the hubble scale during the early hot big bang . throughout this paper",
    "we will use the following formula to relate the frequency of gravitational waves at the present time to the temperature at hubble - crossing in the early radiation - dominated era  @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the effective number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we are able to place upper bounds on the primordial density perturbation from bbn and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) constraints and as well as current ligo , virgo and pulsar timing data .",
    "if we do not detect gravitational waves with future pulsar timing @xcite and future detectors like advanced ligo @xcite , advanced virgo @xcite , lisa @xcite , bbo @xcite and decigo @xcite , the upper bounds on the primordial density perturbation will become significantly tighter .",
    "we emphasize that our bounds come from adopting the standard , minimal cosmological model of adiabatic density perturbations , in their growing mode , in a radiation - dominated early universe from ultra - high energies ( @xmath14  gev ) until matter - domination when @xmath15  ev .",
    "the quantitative constraints will be altered if one adopts non - standard cosmological evolution @xcite such as an early matter - era ( e.g. , temporary domination of the energy density by massive , non - relativistic particles ) or a stiff - fluid - dominated era ( e.g. , domination by the kinetic energy of a coherent , fast - rolling scalar field ) . on general grounds",
    "one expects an early era dominated by fluid `` softer '' than radiation , @xmath16 , to dilute the fractional density of gravitational waves whose wavelength is smaller than the comoving hubble scale ( and thus behave like radiation ) , while the fractional density of sub - horizon gravitational waves grows relative to matter which is stiffer than radiation @xcite . on the other hand the evolution of density perturbations which give rise to gravitational waves",
    "is also altered , see for example ref .",
    "non - adiabatic modes in a multi - component system can lead to large - scale adiabatic density perturbations by the time of last - scattering but arise from initial isocurvature perturbations , so are not necessarily constrained by our analysis .",
    "one such example is the curvaton scenario , where the gravitational waves may be enhanced with respect to the adiabatic case if the curvaton is subdominant when it decays  @xcite .",
    "such models need to be considered on a case by case basis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we introduce the basic equations used to determine the induced gravitational wave background and define the effective energy density of second - order gravitational waves . in section  3",
    "we quantify the constraints placed on the primordial density perturbation by a variety of experiments .",
    "we present our conclusions in section  4 .",
    "in this section we will briefly review the generation of induced gravitational waves .",

    ". we will find it convenient to use the fourier transform @xmath23 where , for an isotropic distribution , the power spectrum is given by @xmath24 on large scales ( much larger than the hubble scale ) the power spectrum of the primordial scalar perturbation is commonly approximated by a power law @xmath25 where the numerical factor @xmath26 comes from the relation between scalar metric perturbation in the longitudinal and comoving gauges on large scales in a radiation - dominated era @xcite .",
    "in the second - order perturbed einstein field equations we see the effect of first - order perturbations as a source term ( @xmath27 ) for second - order tensor perturbations . after putting all first - order perturbation terms to the right - hand side of the einstein field equation",

    "the present density of photons is @xmath48 where here , and throughout this paper , we take @xmath49  km  s@xmath3mpc@xmath3 for the present value of the hubble rate .",
    "in the standard cosmological scenario , second - order gravitational waves are generated during the radiation - dominated era after inflation .",
    "non - linear interactions can in principle lead to density perturbations integrated over a range of scales contributing to the gravitational wave amplitude on a given wavenumber , @xmath45 , but in practice the second - order gravitational waves are primarily produced when first - order density perturbations on the similar on same scale , @xmath50 , come inside the hubble scale during the radiation era @xcite .    assuming a power - law spectrum for the primordial density perturbation , eq .",

    "it is also possible to consider the spectrum of gravitational waves generated by density perturbations with a sharply peaked power spectrum @xcite . considering a delta - function power spectrum , @xmath61 ,",
    "the resulting gravitational wave spectrum is described by a sharply rising spectrum for @xmath62 @xcite @xmath63 with an abrupt cut - off for @xmath64 .    in the following numerical estimates",

    "our results are presented graphically in figure  [ fig : radiation ] .",
    "if the energy density carried by gravitational waves at the time of primordial big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) were large , the abundances of the light nuclei produced would be altered with respect to the predictions of standard bbn .",
    "hence , bbn can be used to constrain the total energy carried by gravitational waves at the time of nucleosynthesis ( @xmath73  mev ) @xcite .",

    "( [ ft ] ) corresponds to frequencies @xmath76 hz today , and scales which are larger than the hubble scale at the start of the radiation - dominated era .",
    "this is model - dependent , but in an inflationary cosmology this would be the hubble scale at the end of reheating after inflation , which could be as large as @xmath77  hz for @xmath78  gev .",

    "we expect the effective energy density on long wavelengths ( on scales of order @xmath92  mpc ) to be independent of the density perturbations on this scale .",

    "it gives effectively the same constraint on the primordial density perturbation ( [ bbnc2 ] ) , and the effective spectral index ( [ nsrbbn ] ) , but extends to longer wavelengths @xmath94  hz , corresponding to scales inside the hubble scale at the time of last - scattering .",
    "future data from cmb experiments such as planck and the proposed cmbpol mission are expected to improve the cmb bound . for planck",

    "despite remarkable recent progress in astronomical observations mapping density perturbations on large scales ( 10 - 1000  mpc ) in our universe , we know little about the primordial distribution of matter on much smaller scales .",
    "this is due to silk damping and free - streaming of relativistic particles in the early universe , and subsequent non - linear evolution of matter perturbations at much later times .",

    "bbn and cmb limits on a primordial gravitational wave background places only a weak constraint on the amplitude of primordial density perturbations , @xmath128 , but this applies across a wide range of frequencies , from @xmath129  hz to frequencies as high as @xmath130  hz , depending on the maximum temperature at the start of the radiation - dominated era .",

    "the most ambitious current proposed gravitational wave observatories including bbo and decigo offer the prospect of detecting gravitational waves as small as @xmath133 .",
    "if gravitational wave background is not detected by these experiments it would imply that the primordial power spectrum remains close to scale - invariant , or decreases in power on small scales , @xmath134 , which provides a valuable new constraint on models for the origin of structure .",
    "nonetheless it remains a challenge to design an experiment that could detect gravitational waves produced by primordial density perturbations of the same power , @xmath135 , as seen on the largest scales in the universe today .",
    "we have assumed the simplest expansion history of the universe , being radiation dominated from very early times , corresponding to temperatures as high as @xmath136  gev . if the early universe has a more complicated history , the constraints may be altered .",
    "a period of inflation is expected to dilute pre - existing gravitational waves on sub - hubble scales , without generating a significant additional background  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "although an early matter - dominated era before bbn , such as the reheating or preheating after inflation , would also dilute any gravitational waves that had already been generated , it could itself produce significant tensor metric perturbations on scales that re - enter the hubble scale during an early matter - dominated era @xcite .",
