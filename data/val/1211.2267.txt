    "yb and li beams emerge from separate effusion ovens , and are directed towards the common `` main '' chamber through individually optimized zeeman slower sections . the long slower tubes [ lengths 93 cm ( li ) and 40 cm ( yb ) , inner diameter 18 mm ] also provide differential pumping . an additional stage of differential pumping",
    "is provided by a short tube ( length 11 cm , inner diameter 5 mm ) separating each oven assembly from an independently pumped `` intermediate '' chamber .",

    "the mot coils produce a vertical gradient of 1.0 g / cm / amp , while the bias coils produce 4.2 g / amp .",
    "we can electronically switch the mot coils to parallel configuration , in which they yield 2.4 g / amp .",

    "we derive the slower beam from an injection - locked diode laser . by adding a second injection beam 228 mhz blue - detuned from the first , we obtain light for repumping from the @xmath17 ground state within the slower .",
    "the yb slower consists of a single 40-cm - long increasing - field stage , operated at 15 a to yield @xmath18 g. the slowing beam has a power of 100 mw , and a red - detuning of 365 mhz from the @xmath9 transition .",
    "compensation coils , mounted opposite to each slower on the main chamber , cancel magnetic fringe fields at the position of the trapped atoms .",
    "together with the vertical bias coils , the slower coils also serve as tools to move the center of the mot quadrupole along all spatial axes , essential for relative positioning of the traps , as discussed below .      for magneto - optical trapping of the two species we use a standard single - species setup with retroreflected mot beams @xcite , modified to accommodate a second atomic species .",
    "we combine the beams for the two species using a dichroic mirror , and divide the combined beam into three beams using broadband polarizing beam splitters .",
    "the polarizations are controlled by single - wavelength half - waveplates and dual - wavelength quarter - wave plates ( foctek ) .",
    "several factors have to be considered in determining the optimum parameters for dual - species laser cooling . due to the difference in linewidth of the li @xmath8 and yb intercombination lines ( factor of 32 )",
    "the two mots are optimized at very different magnetic gradients ( see table [ tab : motparams ] ) . furthermore , the optimal duration of the transitional cooling step ( compression ) before loading into the odt differs greatly for the two species . finally , the two species experience significant losses through inelastic collisions when the magneto - optical traps are spatially overlapped .",

    ", the detuning of the trapping light is modulated with an amplitude of 20 linewidths , at a frequency of 50 khz , to increase the phase - space volume of the trapping region .",
    "we then compress yb in 200 ms , and transfer it to the odt .",
    "we subsequently optimize the quadrupole field for lithium , load the li mot for 0.54 s ( depending on experimental requirements ) , compress in 50 ms , and transfer to the odt .",
    "a short ( 100 @xmath24s ) pulse of light resonant with the li @xmath25 transition optically pumps the li atoms into the ground @xmath17 state .",
    "the positioning of the li mot during load is crucial for large dual - species samples as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : loadcurves ] . the large losses for sub - optimal positioning can be interpreted as a consequence of elastic collisions that heat yb through contact with the li mot , and also of inelastic collisions of ground state yb with electronically excited li atoms in which both constituents are lost .",
    "the latter process also impedes the rate at which the li mot loads , as can be observed in fig .",

    ", li numbers are optimized at a finite load time ; at longer load times sympathetic cooling becomes inefficient due to low yb numbers .",
    "each error bar represents statistical fluctuations of four experimental iterations . ]",
    "we mitigate this effect by applying a bias field during the li load , which spatially offsets the mot from the odt . with a vertical bias field of 2",
    "g the lifetime of yb atoms is quadrupled .",
    "although this lifetime is less than the vacuum - limited lifetime of @xmath2645 s , this still leads to simultaneous confinement of @xmath27 yb atoms and @xmath28 li atoms in the odt , immediately after switching off all the laser cooling beams .    due to the greater abundance of yb in the odt , as well as its lower mot temperature ,",
    "yb acts as a coolant for li . at zero bias field",
    "we observe that , in absence of the yb , most of the li atoms spill from the trap during the first 1 s after transfer from the mot . with a large bath of yb present ,",
    "these losses are mitigated , as the li atoms thermalize with the bath .",
    "we derive our odt from an ytterbium fiber laser ( ipg photonics",
    "ylr-100-lp ) that can provide up to 100w laser power at 1064 nm . during standard operation",
    ", we run the laser at 40w .",
    "we send the laser output through an aom and split the first - order output into two components of equal power and orthogonal polarization .",
    "each component is focused to a waist of @xmath29 m and crossed at a 20@xmath4 angle at the atoms . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chamb ] , both beams are horizontally aligned through the chamber .",
    "this configuration provides a straightforward geometry for our crossed odt .",
    "we perform evaporative cooling by controlling the efficiency of the odt aom .",
    "the geometry of the trap is thus preserved during evaporation , and trap frequencies may be interpolated between measurements at various depths @xcite .      for a given intensity of the 1064 nm odt beam ,",
    "the optical potential for li is greater than that for yb by a factor of about 2 .",
    "thus , at the same temperature , yb will evaporate from the trap significantly faster than li .",
    "for this reason , and because the li ( linear ) size is smaller by a factor of 0.7 at equal temperature , the most practical cooling strategy involves sympathetically cooling li in a bath of yb . we thus optimize the initial conditions to a larger proportion ( @xmath30 ) of trapped yb , and set the rate of evaporative cooling to match the interspecies thermalization time , which is of order 1 s throughout .",
    "this method works well even in the regime of quantum degeneracy , since the condensation temperature for yb is an order of magnitude lower than the li fermi temperature ( for equal li and yb numbers ) .",
    "a more detailed discussion of this scheme can be found in @xcite .",
    "we believe that this method of cooling will readily transfer to other alkali metal + spin - singlet systems , where some performance aspects may be even better than in yb - li .",
    "the number of inter - species collisions necessary for thermalization between particles of masses @xmath31 and @xmath32 is of order @xmath33 , where the dimensionless parameter @xmath34 @xcite . for @xmath6li and @xmath11yb , @xmath35 , which is relatively large .",
    "furthermore , since li can not be laser cooled to such low temperatures as yb , a considerable amount of yb is lost through evaporation during initial thermalization",
    ". both of these effects will be less severe with other alkali - metal atoms such as na , k , rb , and cs .",
    "we also note that a similar mismatch of trap depth in a 1064 nm odt will exist and a similar immunity to two - body inelastic losses is expected , both advantageous for sympathetic cooling with yb @xcite .",
    "we simultaneously probe the collocated , optically trapped clouds of li and yb using absorption imaging .",
    "the imaging beams are overlapped before they enter the vacuum chamber , using a broadband polarizing beam splitter .",
    "the beams are split after they emerge from the vacuum chamber using dichroic mirrors , and the cloud images are projected onto two different regions of the ccd camera chip .",
    "absorption images for both clouds are obtained for each experimental iteration .",

    "the reduction in size and heat capacity of the coolant , and the differential gravitational sag are all effects which can reduce the sympathetic cooling efficiency @xcite .",
    "further , we might expect a reduction in condensate number in the presence of li , due to collisions between energetic li atoms near the fermi velocity @xmath56cm / s and the yb bec ( peak condensate speed of sound @xmath57mm / s ) , which may explain the condensate number reduction reported in @xcite .    in spite of the aforementioned issues ,",

    "temperatures below @xmath58 can be achieved [ fig.[fig : dbldegen](c ) ] . by keeping a small amount of yb in the trap , we establish a system in which yb may act as an impurity probe of the @xmath6li degenerate fermi gas .",

    "the first one is a three - component system of yb and two resonantly interacting li spin states , a regime recently explored experimentally by khramov _",
    "_ @xcite . here",
    "studies of strongly interacting fermi gases using yb as a dissipative bath or an impurity probe may be carried out . while the strong interactions induce inelastic loss processes at unitarity , which are unobservable in the weakly interacting regime , the inter - species elastic processes still dominate and we have observed temperatures as low as @xmath59 .",
    "the other strongly - interacting regime of current interest is a feshbach resonance between yb and li atoms .",
    "theoretical calculations by brue and hutson @xcite , predict narrow magnetically induced feshbach resonances between @xmath12yb and @xmath6li . these have not yet been experimentally observed .",
    "a fundamental limiting factor in preserving interspecies contact in degenerate yb - li mixtures is the differential gravitational sag of the two species at low trap depths . in our trap ,",
    "the yb atoms , due to their greater mass and weaker optical confinement , become significantly displaced from the li atoms at temperatures near 300 nk , compromising the efficiency of sympathetic cooling and generally the study of any inter - species interaction effects .",
    "a technique for circumventing this limitation is discussed in the following section .",
    "differences in internal properties between components of an ultracold mixture can result in a differential response to external fields .",
    "this sometimes leads to unwanted effects such as the differential vertical displacement due to gravity experienced in mixtures with unequal mass constituents . for the weak optical potentials needed to achieve the highest phase space densities ,",
    "this `` gravitational sag '' leads to reduced spatial overlap and reduced inter - species interactions .",
    "the differential gravitational sag is an important limiting factor for the molecule formation efficiency in the k - rb mixture @xcite , where the mass ratio is 2.2 . in the case of the yb - li mixture , where the mass ratio is 29 ,",
    "this effect is even more significant , leading to a nearly complete decoupling of the two species at the lowest temperatures @xcite . here",
    "we demonstrate that this differential gravitational sag can be mitigated by the use of a magnetic field gradient which exerts a force on only the lithium component .    in principle",
    ", one may use external magnetic fields to achieve independent control of any two atomic species .",
    "for instance , in alkali - metal atoms with half - integer nuclear spin there will exist states with magnetic projection @xmath60 in the direction of the magnetic field , allowing one species to be made insensitive to magnetic gradients .",
    "however , this insensitivity does not extend to the high magnetic fields often required in experiments , ( e.g. to address feshbach resonances ) due to hyperfine decoupling .",
    "furthermore , mixtures of high - field and low - field seeking atoms are prone to inelastic , internal state - changing collisions , which lead to trap losses",
    ".    mixtures of alkali - metal and alkaline - earth - metal atoms avoid these limitations as the ground - state magnetic moment of the alkaline - earth - metal species is zero or nearly zero for all external fields . furthermore , in isotopes with zero nuclear moment , spin - exchange collisions are suppressed entirely .",
    "this featurehas been used to overlap clouds of magnetically trapped rubidium atoms with optically trapped ytterbium atoms @xcite . here",
    "we report on manipulating the relative displacement of two species that are confined in the same optical trapping potential , and over a large temperature range down to @xmath61k .",
    "when atoms in a trap are subjected to a uniform force @xmath62 , the center of mass is displaced by an amount @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the vertical trapping frequency . due to differences in mass and polarizability ,",
    "the trap frequencies for li and yb differ by a factor of 8 , leading to substantial differential gravitational sag at low trap depths .",
    "we demonstrate control of interspecies spatial overlap by applying a magnetic gradient which acts as a `` pseudo - gravitational '' force on li only .",
    "we first prepare a mixture of @xmath6li in its two lowest energy states and the single ground state of @xmath11yb at a particular optical trap depth . for experimental simplicity",
    ", we ramp the bias field to @xmath65 g , where the two li spin states have equal magnetic moments @xmath66 and negligible interaction strength .",
    "we then turn on our mot coils to add a magnetic quadrupole field to the vertical bias field , thereby creating a magnetic force in the direction of the bias field .",

    "the in - trap @xmath72 height of the ytterbium cloud is approximately 2 @xmath24 m , whereas the li cloud size is near the fermi radius of 6 @xmath24 m .",
    "thus , in the absence of a magnetic gradient , the spatial overlap of the two clouds is critically reduced at trap depths below 20 @xmath24k .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sagfig ] is a set of theoretical curves of relative displacement , derived from a simple numerical model assuming a gaussian trap profile .",

    "we find reasonably good agreement between this model and the experimental data , although the calculation slightly overestimates the degree of sag at the lowest trap depths .",
    "one plausible explanation for this is a small vertical misalignment of the odt beams , leading to a deviation from a gaussian profile .",
    "a side effect of this technique is that the applied gradient , while shifting the center of the trap , also effectively lowers the trap depth .",
    "thus , for deeply degenerate fermi clouds where the initial trap depth is close to the fermi temperature , the `` tilted '' potential leads to spilling of li atoms near the fermi energy .",
    "this effect appears as a gradient - dependent li number loss at the lowest depths ( when @xmath74 ) in our experiment and has been utilized elsewhere to measure interaction strength in fermi gases @xcite and to accelerate evaporative cooling in bose gases @xcite .",
    "we also note that the field inhomogeneity introduced by the magnetic gradient can limit its usefulness in experiments that require extremely homogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "for instance , a gradient of 65 g / cm corresponds to a magnetic field variation of tens of milligauss across the sample , much larger than the theoretical width of the predicted magnetic feshbach resonances between 173yb and 6li @xcite .",
    "species - selective control of atomic samples has also been demonstrated using only optical fields .",
    "bichromatic optical traps exploiting the different ac stark shifts of atoms have been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "our technique has the advantage of requiring no additional lasers or sensitive alignment of optics .",
    "the effect is achieved entirely with existing hardware , operating under typical conditions .",
    "in addition to the application described above , the magnetic gradient technique enables experiments involving the use of one atomic species as a local probe of the other . in the @xmath6li-@xmath11yb system ,",
    "the yb acts as a `` bath '' at temperatures above degeneracy , where its cloud is much larger than that of li . at low temperatures",
    ", yb can act as a `` probe , '' , since the yb cloud is much smaller than the li fermi radius @xcite . under the latter conditions ,",
    "yb can be a useful probe for studying the local properties of a fermi gas in the weakly interacting as well as in the superfluid regime .    beyond spatial control",
    ", one can also use magnetic gradients to achieve selective control of the momentum of the magnetically sensitive species , by changing the gradient non - adiabatically .",
    "such velocity - control techniques may be useful for a range of studies , such as measures of viscosity and tests of superfluidity .",
    "we have presented a detailed description of our apparatus to produce stable quantum mixtures of lithium and ytterbium atoms .",
    "we have also demonstrated a method of controlling the spatial overlap of the two species , general to combinations of magnetic and non - magnetic atoms .",
    "when prepared near the @xmath6li feshbach resonance , bosonic yb can act as a microscopic probe of the strongly interacting lithium fermi gas .",
    "other future applications of the mixture include the study of condensed matter models in an optical lattice , such as the binary - alloy model .",
    "an interspecies feshbach resonance between lithium and ytterbium will allow the exploration of three - body efimov states with large mass mismatch , and potential studies of the many - body physics of mass - imbalanced pairs .",
    "while such resonances have not yet been observed , they may show up in the near future in experiments with the ground - state mixture , or by using yb in an excited metastable state ( such as @xmath75 ) @xcite .",
    "an additional possibility is an inter - species optical feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "finally , the quantum - degenerate mixture of lithium and ytterbium provides the starting point for the production of quantum gases of paramagnetic polar molecules of ybli .",
    "such ultracold molecules are of general interest from the perspective of quantum simulation @xcite , quantum information @xcite , tests of fundamental symmetries @xcite , and probes of time variations of physical constants @xcite .",
    "we thank lee willcockson and ryan weh for major technical contributions during the early stages of the experiment .",
