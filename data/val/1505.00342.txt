    "in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) , the gravitational force is explained in terms of the space - time curvature so that the field equations connect the space - time geometry to the matter content .",
    "more technically , gr exhibits a universe modeled by space - time with a mathematical structure formed by four dimensional differentiable manifold @xcite .",
    "it is commonly believed that a unique mathematical framework to reconcile the quantum mechanics ( qm ) with gr is highly dependent on our understanding of the space - time geometry . in other words",
    ", there is a comprehensive agreement that the geometry of space - time is fundamentally explained by a quantum theory .",
    "it is assumed that the planck energy @xmath1 addresses a critical energy scale of transition from classical gr to quantum gravity ( qg ) , a theory which is supposed to challenge the most fundamental and long standing issues of modern physics . despite the lack of a complete theory of qg",
    ", it seems a semi - classical or effective phenomenological approach of qg may guide us to disclose the mysterious nature of qg @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand how to extract the testable predictions from this fundamental theory .",
    "interestingly , all semi - classical approaches offered so far unanimously insist on the existence of a minimal measurement length in the nature , known as the planck length @xmath2 .",
    "besides , it is believed that the modified mass - shell condition ( or dispersion relations ) arising from deviation of lorentz invariance in effective phenomenological approaches @xcite , may justify some of the phenomena taking place in astronomical and cosmological scale , like the threshold anomalies of ultra high energy cosmic rays and tev photons @xcite .",
    "it is noticeable that such lorentz invariance violation is already predicted in the context of other approaches to qg such as : non - commutative geometry @xcite , spin network in loop quantum gravity @xcite , and string field theory @xcite . throughout the present work",
    ", our attention specifically is focused on a semi - classical formalism knows as _ ",
    "gravity s rainbow \" _ which has been designed by magueijo and smolin @xcite .",
    "in fact , it can be said that the rainbow gravity is nothing but the doubly special relativity ( dsr ) @xcite in the presence of curved space - time which is knows as the _ ",
    "doubly general relativity\"_(dgr ) . in this formalism",
    ", there is no single fixed space - time background , namely the space - time background appears as a geometric spectrum in terms of the energy scale of the particle probe .",
    "therefore , in the cosmological setting , we are dealing with the rainbow modified metric by introducing a function in the friedmann - robertson - walker ( fwr ) metric which depends on such variable energy scale .",
    "formation of the rainbow metric proposal involve various motivations such as the lack of a trivial definition of the dual position space in dsr @xcite .",
    "however , this approach to qg is not problem free and considerable number of works have been focused on its various aspects @xcite . somehow , the proposal of gravity s rainbow is similar to the idea of _ `` running coupling constants '' _ in particle physics and field theory , in the sense that at very small distances ( high energy ) the space - time geometry is related to the energy scale of the particle probe @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , apart from the effective approaches to qg like dsr and dgr , it has been argued that if the physical space - time of the standard gr theory is emergent , then it is expected that we face with a radical picture of the universe at fundamental quantum scale @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of _ `` emergent universe '' _ dates back to the works of eddington in 1930 @xcite , inspired by the proposal of einstein static universe ( esu ) . in simple words , esu suggests that the content of the universe as a closed system is made up of at least cosmological constant and normal matter .",
    "while esu in the context of gr is not stable versus spatially homogeneous perturbations , it predicts that the universe in past might have been emerged as an static initial states @xcite .",
    "we know that the data obtained by cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations , generally supports the inflationary scenario .",
    "also , by implementation of some singularity theorems with the geometrical assumptions that @xmath3 or @xmath4 , it has been shown that despite the occurrence of inflation , the universe had a violent beginning in the past @xcite .",
    "hence , one of the most important motivations for studying qg is to avoid the singularity at the beginning of the universe .",
    "recovery of esu in the framework of inflationary universe by ellise and maartens , knows as modern version of eddington emergent universe , was in this direction of research interest @xcite .",
    "according to the modern standard cosmology , the inflationary expansion of the universe has quickly eliminated any original spatial curvature .",
    "on the other hand , the cmb observations implies @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) for the total density parameter .",
    "this means that the geometry of universe is not exactly flat , rather it could have non - zero spatial curvature at the beginning , resulting in negligible late - time effects . in this sense ,",
    "the emergent universe scenario allowed the existence of a positive curvature universe that emanates asymptotically as a static initial state known as esu which afterwards experienced the inflation .",
    "the stable esu addresses the existence of a fixed point around which our universe in the early times was eternally fluctuating . in the case of the universe filled with a massless scalar field @xmath7 with a suitable inflaton potential , these fluctuations had been disappeared and the stable state of universe had been turned to inflationary phase . within the context of standard cosmology ,",
    "the prerequisites of a one or further flat wings ( of course with a little positive gradient ) in the inflaton potential , can make an emergent universe .",
    "this transmission from a stable esu to inflationary phase takes place around the different values of e - folds .",
    "for instance , in @xcite by analyzing the spectrum of inflationary perturbations of some stable cosmological models in the context of gr , it has been demonstrated that the transmission occurs in over 60 e - folds .",
    "also , it should be noted that while these inflationary emergence gr - based models respect to cmb constraints , they suffer from a fine - tuning problem .",
    "this problem can be resolved in the context of modified emergence models of gr .",
    "however , recently in @xcite some arguments are presented which tries to show the emergent cosmological scenario can not really be past - eternal . as a prominent feature of emergent universe scenario , one can point to the removal of initial singularity and also the horizon problem .",
    "this is a strong motivation to study the esu models along with their stability conditions in the presence of high energy corrections of gr .",
    "for instance , one can point to the works done in the context of massive gravity @xcite , hoava - lifshitz model of gravity @xcite , braneworld scenarios @xcite , induced matter theory @xcite , loop quantum cosmology @xcite , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 gravity @xcite . as discussed at the beginning of this section , gravity s rainbow or dgr",
    "is also considered as an alternative of gr with high energy corrections .",
    "besides , it has been shown that in the study of frw cosmology and isotropic quantum cosmological perfect fluid model in rainbow gravity setup , some conditions are derived which prevent the initial singularity @xcite",
    ". inspired by this introduction , our main goal in this paper is to study the stability of esu against the homogeneous scalar , vector and tensor perturbations in the presence of rainbow s gravity setup as a qg modification of gr .",
    "but before doing this , by following the phase space method we will analyze the status of the big - bang singularity in the framework of a flat rainbow frw universe model .",
    "+ the present paper is arranged as follows : in section 2 , we have derive rainbow modified friedman equations in details for a general non - flat universe . in section 3 , by introducing two different forms of rainbow functions depending on energy density , firstly in absence of cosmological constant , we obtain the stability conditions of esu against the homogeneous linear scalar perturbations . in the follow of this section , we pursue our goal in the presence of a cosmological constant related to energy density via introducing a new rainbow function . in section 4 ,",
    "we analysis the stability against the vector and tensor perturbations . finally in section 5 ,",
    "we give the summery and conclusions .",
    "in this section , firstly we have a quick review on the gravity s rainbow theory , known also as dgr .",
    "then , with note to the importance of spatial curvature in emergent universe scenario , we derive the modified friedman equations for general non - flat universes . in dsr ,",
    "the modified dispersion relations of a massive particle with mass @xmath11 reads as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the well known energy dependent rainbow functions and @xmath15 is a dimensionless parameter . in the low energy limit ,",
    "the modified dispersion relation ( [ e1 - 1 ] ) reduces to the relativistic dispersion relations .",
    "so , the rainbow functions @xmath16 and @xmath14 satisfy the following conditions @xmath17 indeed , the condition ( [ e1 - 2 ] ) points to the correspondence principle . based on the discussion carried out in @xcite , for established position space in dsr , theories including free fields must also lead to the plane wave solutions in flat space - time , despite satisfying the modified dispersion relations ( [ e1 - 1 ] ) .",
    "for this reason , contraction between infinitesimal displacement @xmath18 and momentum @xmath19 , must be linearly invariant , i.e @xmath20 in fact , the linear contraction ( [ e1 - 3 ] ) guarantees the existence of the plane wave solutions .",
    "the rainbow metric generally has the form of @xmath21 using a one parameter family of energy momentum tensors , the gravity s rainbow modified einstein equations will be written as @xmath22 so that @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are energy dependent rainbow functions .",
    "this means that in dgr setup , the newtonian gravitational constant and the cosmological constants are energy dependent such that in low energy limit , we recover @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "in order to achieve our main goal , in this section we will set @xmath29 for simplicity , and begin with the following modified frw metric of a homogeneous and isotropic universe @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents the spatial part of the metric .",
    "commonly , it is assumed that the energy @xmath32 of particle probe for each measurement is constant and independent of space - time coordinates .",
    "nevertheless , such assumption for the measurements at early universe seems to be far from reality .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the background metric of space - time throughout its evolution is affected by the energy @xmath32 of particle probe .",
    "then , it is reasonable to consider the evolution of energy @xmath32 with the cosmological time , denoted as @xmath33 . in this regard",
    ", we will derive the modified frw equations .",
    "in doing so , the following ansatz is usually suggested @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 has the form of @xmath36 . therefore , the modified einstein field equation can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is ricci tensor defined as follows @xmath39 and @xmath40 is written in terms of the energy momentum tensor @xmath41 as@xmath42 to continue our calculations , we need the non - zero components of the affine connection as @xcite @xmath43 it is seen that unlike the usual frw metric , for modified frw metric ( [ e2 - 1 ] ) , the components of the affine connection with two time indices remain non - zero . by putting ( [ e2 - 5 ] ) into ( [ e2 - 3 ] ) and after a straightforward calculation , we obtain @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the purely spatial ricci tensor defined as @xmath47 the spatial components @xmath48 of the four dimensional affine connection are identical with those of affine connection computed in three dimensions from the spatial three - metric @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes purely spatial affine connection and @xmath51 is the inverse of the @xmath52 matrix @xmath31 . therefore , we have @xmath53 which results in @xmath54 here , @xmath55 has a geometrical interpretation .",
    "indeed , it measures the spatial curvature with zero , negative and positive @xmath55 values corresponding to flat , open and closed universes respectively @xcite .",
    "the ricci tensor expression ( [ e2 - 7 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath56 now , for obtaining the components of @xmath57 , we consider the perfect fluid with the energy - momentum tensor as @xmath58 so that @xmath59 and @xmath60 represent the energy density and the pressure , respectively . also , @xmath61 is the velocity four vector defined by @xmath62 , with the norm of @xmath63 .",
    "we should note that the diagonal components of the modified frw metric tensor @xmath64 is @xmath65 with the signature @xmath66 so that the components of spatial tensor @xmath67 are independent of the rainbow function @xmath35 . using the equation ( [ e2 - 4 ] )",
    ", one can decompose the time and spatial components of @xmath68 tensor as follows @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 by substituting expressions ( [ e2 - 13 ] ) and ( [ e2 - 14 ] ) into ( [ e2 - 12 ] ) , we have @xmath72 ultimately , the first and second rainbow modified friedman equations for the metric parameterized by the varying energy probe ( [ e2 - 1 ] ) , takes the form of @xmath73 @xmath74 here , also for simplicity , it is assumed that gravitational constant @xmath75 is independent of energy @xmath32 . it should be noted that the existence of @xmath76 term in the second rainbow modified friedman equations , does not mean the explicit dependence of rainbow function to the time i.e. @xmath77 , at all .",
    "as explained above , @xmath35 is an explicit function of the energy of the test particles which are probing the geometry of space - time in early universe .",
    "given the fact that @xmath32 can vary with respect to the evolution of universe , so @xmath35 can be an implicit function of cosmic time and not explicit .",
    "we note that , the explicit dependence of @xmath35 to the time , may be leads to this wrong result from equations ( [ e2-a ] ) and ( [ e2-b ] ) that they are nothing but the usual friedman equations of gr so that the rainbow function @xmath35 in this case is merely the gauge parameter determining the choice of time .",
    "hence , based on the gauge freedom , one may choose the gauge of @xmath78 .",
    "in contrast to this misconception , the gravity s rainbow theory is a high energy modified theory of gr in which according to _ correspondence principle , _ for the case of low energy limit i.e. @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) , modified friedman equations ( [ e2-a ] ) and ( [ e2-b ] ) reduce to the standard equations for the frw universe .",
    "also , we mention that due to the existence of the rainbow functions , @xmath81 may play the role of proper time based on the gauge choice @xmath82 @xcite . as expected , in the limit of gr , @xmath81 represents the proper time indicated by the choice of @xmath83 .",
    "also , by combining the modified friedman equations ( [ e2-a ] ) and ( [ e2-b ] ) , we get the following energy conservation equation @xmath84 it can be mentioned that in framework of dgr , the form of equation of state ( eos ) @xmath85 , remains unchanged for massless prob particles such as photons while for the massive ones , this equation of state will be modified , see @xcite for more discussion .",
    "in this section , we plan to apply the linear homogeneous scalar perturbations in the vicinity of the einstein static universe and explore its stability against these perturbations .",
    "to achieve our goal , we need to fix the rainbow function @xmath35 . to this end , using dispersion relation offered in @xcite , we introduce rainbow functions as follows @xmath87 where via suggesting the average energy @xmath88 ( @xmath89 is some constant ) @xcite , this rainbow function will be rewritten as @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "the authors of @xcite , to reach the above relation considered a large ensemble of prob photons which are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this assumption is reasonable since based on the standard model of cosmology , early universe passed a radiation dominated era with @xmath92 .",
    "one may ask the question that why the identification @xmath93 is used to obtain the rainbow function ( [ e3 - 2 ] ) ? .",
    "the answer is that , we are deal with the energy of prob particle in the rainbow metric as the statistical mean value of all prob photons in radiation domination .",
    "indeed , we deal with the average effect of photon particles in radiation dominated era and no with a special elected photon from the radiation @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to remind that the form of @xmath94 in terms of @xmath59 is independent of the modified dispersion relation picked for a specific model @xcite .",
    "we also mention that the above rainbow function is valuable from the theoretical viewpoint so that in @xcite it is shown that in the absence of the varying speed of light ( vsl ) proposal , it can removes the horizon problem in early universe .",
    "moreover , it is seen that when @xmath59 or @xmath94 get their largest values , then @xmath95 or @xmath96 becomes infinite which causes the time - like component of the rainbow metric vanishing .",
    "this means that the frw metric which is modified with rainbow function ( [ e3 - 2 ] ) becomes degenerate at that time and has no inverse .",
    "indeed , a degenerate metric addresses the existence of other distinct possibility for lightlike dimension ( other than timelike and spacelike dimensions ) . also , remember that in the palatini formulation of standard gr , degenerate metric also appears .",
    "one of the consequences the degenerate metric is that the curvature remains bounded and the topology of space - time can change .",
    "overall , it is believed that singularities arisen from degenerate metric have a milder manner than other type of singularities and seem appropriate for a qg proposal @xcite . here , it is necessary to review the finite time singularity issue , including the big - bang singularity , in the presence of rainbow function ( [ e3 - 2 ] ) .",
    "indeed , we want to investigate whether the presence of rainbow function ( [ e3 - 2 ] ) in this system will lead to resolve the singularity problem .",
    "inspired by the idea proposed in @xcite , we want to resolve this problem by finding an upper bound on the density of energy @xmath59 .",
    "in other words , according to @xcite the finite time singularity issue will be eliminated via the presentation of a fixed point as @xmath97 for energy density @xmath59 which is reached at an infinite time .",
    "more exactly , the author of @xcite , by following the terminology used for stability analyzing the dynamical systems in @xcite , demonstrated that for any first order system as @xmath98 , the finite time singularity will be solved through the fulfillment of either of the following conditions : 1 ) the function @xmath99 be a continuous and differentiable on a range enclosed by zeroes of function @xmath99 .",
    "2 ) asymptotically , function @xmath99 growths like a linear function as @xmath100 or slower than it ,",
    "i.e @xmath101 . therefore ,",
    "for cancelation of the finite time singularity , it is sufficient that one of these conditions is satisfied .",
    "we begin our analysis in this way by substituting the rainbow function ( [ e3 - 2 ] ) into energy conservation equation ( [ e2-c ] ) and modified first friedmann equation ( [ e2-a ] ) ( for case @xmath102 ) to obtain the ordinary differential equation ( ode ) as @xmath98 where @xmath103 the advantage of the dynamical system analysis method followed in @xcite is that by having fixed points and regarding the asymptotic behavior of @xmath99 , one is able to predict the demeanor of the system without need to have a detailed form of the solutions .",
    "hence , by setting @xmath104 ( since our attention is on radiation dominated state in order to study the initial singularity ) , equation ( [ e3 - 3 ] ) results in the following two fixed points @xmath105 however , to understand the qualitative manner of a solution , we should know that how long it takes to get a fixed point . by a straightforward calculation",
    ", one can show that the time required to reach these fixed points , can be obtained as @xmath106 where @xmath107 represents an arbitrary initial finite value for density which lies in the intervals between the fixed points .",
    "the negative sign in the back of integral relation , denotes a backward in direction of time .",
    "we find that for the case of @xmath108 , the integral ( [ e3 - 5 ] ) does not converge i.e. @xmath109 , while for the fixed point @xmath110 the integral ( [ e3 - 5 ] ) is not solvable and its numerical values fail to converge . at this point ,",
    "let us to draw the plot @xmath111 ( or @xmath112 in the figure 1 , in order to get a qualitative analysis of the situation .    as it is seen from the figure 1 , @xmath99 has two fixed points @xmath108 and @xmath113 .",
    "in fact , any of these fixed points are equivalent to a de sitter space since in these points we are dealing with constant solution ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the first @xmath115 is a future fixed point because for the case @xmath116 we have @xmath117 , while the second @xmath118 is an early ( or past ) fixed point since for case of @xmath119 and   @xmath120 we have @xmath117 and @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "it is noteworthy that for distinction between the type of this singularities , we follow ref .",
    "these fixed points classify the possible solutions into two classes : 1 ) a solution belongs to interval @xmath122 $ ] , if @xmath123 and 2 ) a solution belongs to interval @xmath124 , if @xmath125 .",
    "then , to get the fixed point @xmath115 by beginning from some initial value as @xmath107 and also from @xmath118 to @xmath107 , the time required is infinite . in this interval",
    ", @xmath99 is continuous and differentiable .",
    "then , according to approach in @xcite by pursuing the terminology of @xcite , one can say that the first solution is free of physical singularity so that it interpolates steadily from @xmath115 to @xmath118 .",
    "it is clear that the first condition already is not usable for the second solution , which represents a clear violation of the second condition . on the other hand , for the case @xmath125 ,",
    "the function ( [ e3 - 3 ] ) is growing quicker than a linear function .",
    "so , we conclude that the second solution is not free of a finite time singularity . because we are interested in studying initial singularity problem , so",
    "let us mention to stability status of early fixed point @xmath118 .",
    "a fixed point is stable if by putting a neighboring initial value , the trajectory of the solution remains always near to the fixed point .",
    "equivalently , a fixed point is unstable if for any point at vicinity of the fixed point , one can find some solution that starts near the fixed point but go away from it in a finite time .",
    "the fixed point @xmath118 is an unstable point because @xmath126 . , if @xmath126 , we have increasing @xmath127 at @xmath118 , or equivalently @xmath128 for all sufficiently small and positive @xmath129",
    "this means that if we start with initial value @xmath125 in the vicinity of @xmath118 , since @xmath130 then the trajectory of the ode solution increases its value of @xmath118 and moves away from the fixed point . also if we start with @xmath131 , but near to @xmath118 , again trajectory of the ode solution moves away from the fixed point but by decreasing its value of @xmath118 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath126 , we conclude that the fixed point @xmath118 is unstable .",
    "similarly , one can show that if @xmath132 , the fixed point will be stable .",
    "] then , although it takes an infinite time to get a fixed point , the issue of finite time singularities avoidance remains unsolved and eventually this fixed point will collapse .",
    "+ now , we investigate the dgr theory form the emergent universe point of view in which there is no beginning of time and consequently , there is no big bang singularity in the early universe . in this scenario ,",
    "the universe did not born from a big - bang singularity in a past finite time and rather it possesses an eternal einstein static state . in this context , the key point is the required conditions for the stability of the existing esu , in which we will explore in the following of the present paper .",
    "the esu in the dgr scenario with rainbow functions varying with cosmological time can be obtained by the conditions @xmath133 through the equations ( [ e2-a ] ) and ( [ e2-b ] ) as @xmath134 and @xmath135 where @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 denote the scale factor , the energy density of the einstein static universe and barotropic equation of state parameter ( @xmath85 ) , respectively . considering the positive energy condition @xmath139 through the equation ( [ e3 - 6 ] )",
    ", it is seen that for the einstein static universe , the spatial curvature of the universe should be positive , @xmath140 . also , eq.([e3 - 7 ] )",
    ", shows that for the einstein static universe in the framework of rainbow gravity , we need to have @xmath141 or @xmath142 corresponding to @xmath143 .",
    "the perturbations in the cosmic scale factor @xmath144 and the energy density @xmath145 can be written as @xmath146 substituting ( [ e3 - 8 ] ) into the equation ( [ e2-a ] ) after linearizing the perturbation terms , we obtain the following equation @xmath147 this indicates , with respect to the positiveness of @xmath55 , that the sign of variation of the scale factor must be opposite to the sign of variation of the matter density .",
    "we must also apply the same method on the equation ( [ e2-b ] ) , however before doing this let us introduce the following replacement due to the perturbation in the rainbow function @xmath95 @xmath148 such that @xmath149 also , by combining the energy conservation equation ( [ e2-c ] ) with the first rainbow modified frw equation ( [ e2-a ] ) , we obtain @xmath150 then , after applying perturbation ( [ e3 - 8 ] ) , we have @xmath151 by substituting ( [ e3 - 6 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 9 ] ) into the above expression , one finds that @xmath152 .",
    "it seems that this result is independent of any specific form of rainbow function @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , it can be seen that the last term of the second rainbow modified frw equation ( [ e2-b ] ) does not contribute in derivation of stability conditions of einstein static universe in the framework of dgr scenario .",
    "now , putting perturbation equations ( [ e3 - 8 ] ) into ( [ e2-b ] ) and using ( [ e3 - 10 ] ) , we get @xmath153 where inserting the equation ( [ e3 - 9 ] ) into ( [ e3 - 13 ] ) and neglecting the non - linear perturbation terms , results in the following differential equation @xmath154 it is obvious that , for the cases @xmath155 , i.e. @xmath156 , eq.([e3 - 14 ] ) will take the following form @xmath157 which refers to the oscillatory modes of esu in the framework of standard gr for @xmath158 . in order to have the general oscillating perturbation modes in the framework of the dgr scenario",
    ", the following condition should be satisfied @xmath159 which results in the following solution for the equation ( [ e3 - 14 ] ) @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are integration constants and @xmath163 refers to the frequency of oscillation around the stable esu as @xmath164 now , we can analysis the stability condition ( [ e3 - 16 ] ) .",
    "eqs.([e3 - 6 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 7 ] ) will play the role of two fundamental constraints to achieve our goal .",
    "there are two possibility in order to satisfy the equation ( [ e3 - 7 ] ) ; the first one is that @xmath141 and the second one is that the matter density of the esu be @xmath143 . if we set @xmath141 , then the condition ( [ e3 - 16 ] ) is automatically violated and we obtain @xmath165 implying that there is no stable esu against the linear scalar perturbations in the form of relations ( [ e3 - 8 ] ) . as it is clear from eq.([e3 - 15 ] ) , in the framework of the standard gr for @xmath141 , there is no stable esu . for the second possibility as @xmath143 , with respect to the positivity of the spatial curvature , due to the positive energy condition through equation ( [ e3 - 6 ] ) , we need that the barotropic eos parameter satisfies @xmath166 .",
    "overall , one can find that there is a stable esu versus homogenous and linear scalar perturbations in context of the gravity s rainbow scenario with choosing the rainbow function ( [ e3 - 2 ] ) .",
    "in this case , we need two bounds which the first one in on eos parameter as @xmath166 and the second one is on the energy density of esu as @xmath167 . there are no such similar results in the framework of the standard gr theory .",
    "unlike gr , here there is a stable solution against small scalar perturbations for a closed universe filled by the matter fields respecting the energy conditions .",
    "also , within standard gr theory and even in many of the modified gravity theories , there is no such upper bounds on energy density of esu @xmath168 . in the following ,",
    "we want to investigate the stability conditions of einstein static universe against the linear homogeneous scalar perturbations in the context of dgr , in terms of another rainbow function proposed by ling and et al in @xcite , which is evolving with cosmic time as @xmath169 considering previous arguments after placing the average energy @xmath170 @xcite , it can be rewritten in terms of energy density @xmath59 as @xmath171 where @xmath172 is a constant .",
    "let us point out that rainbow function ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) has application in the framework of black hole physics leading to valuable phenomenological outcomes , e.g. see @xcite .",
    "moreover , it also as previous rainbow function has a theoretical trait . by reaching the energy density @xmath59 or @xmath94 to its largest value ,",
    "@xmath95 in ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) becomes zero which leads to vanishing spatial - like components of the rainbow metric .",
    "this means that frw metric modified by ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) or ( [ e3 - 19 ] ) , is a smooth and differentiable metric but is not invertible .",
    "moreover , by applying the rainbow functions ( [ e3 - 19 ] ) or ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) , we will be faced with a degenerate metric at energy levels close to the planck energy scale . also , based on the fact that there is no observational evidence for lightlike dimension in nature",
    ", there might be a suppression mechanism for appearance of lightlike dimension at the quantum level of universe @xcite .",
    "+    as before , we first examine the big - bang singularity problem for such a choice of rainbow function within a flat rainbow frw model . in the same way , for the rainbow function ( [ e3 - 20 ] )",
    ", we get @xmath173 which has only one fixed point @xmath108 and is not bounded , see figure 2 .",
    "as it is seen from the figure , the function @xmath99 begins from the fixed point @xmath115 and ends with a singularity .",
    "so we must separately calculate the time needed from an infinite to a finite value @xmath107 as well as the time needed from @xmath107 to the fixed point @xmath108 , i.e , @xmath174 and @xmath175 here , we are dealing with a different situation compared to the previous one .",
    "we found that the integral ( [ e3 - 21a ] ) converges which provide @xmath176 while the integral ( [ e3 - 21b ] ) does not converge anyway on the given interval .",
    "this means that from @xmath107 to fixed point @xmath108 an infinite time is needed , i.e @xmath177 while to get an infinite to a finite value @xmath107 it takes a finite time . because the rainbow frw metric includes a natural cutoff as the energy planck , the constraint obtained for integral ( [ e3 - 21a ] ) should lie in the interval @xmath178 .",
    "then , the solution derived from the rainbow function ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) for the flat rainbow universe model can not be free of finite time singularity .    we conclude that even assuming that integral ( [ e3 - 21a ] ) results in an infinite time , the big - bang singularity issue is not canceled , yet . because according to the discussion given in the previous case , one can realize that @xmath115 is a future fixed point and is not a past one .     + in the following ,",
    "we study the dgr theory from the emergent universe point of view and investigate the required conditions for the stability of an esu with respect to scalar perturbations , in the presence of rainbow function ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) . by applying the scalar perturbation terms on the rainbow function ( [ e3 - 20 ] )",
    ", it takes the form @xmath179 where @xmath180 now , inserting the equations ( [ e3 - 24 ] ) , ( [ e3 - 25 ] ) and the perturbation equations ( [ e3 - 8 ] ) into the second rainbow modified friedmann equation ( [ e2-b ] ) , we have @xmath181 where similar to the previous analysis , we neglected non - linear terms . finally , by applying the equations ( [ e3 - 7 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 9 ] ) , the above differential equation takes the following form @xmath182 as can be seen , for the limit @xmath183 , the above equation reduces to the oscillatory modes ( [ e3 - 15 ] ) .",
    "then , in order to have a stable esu in the framework of dgr scenario , the following condition should be satisfied @xmath184 where the frequency of oscillatory modes @xmath163 for the rainbow function ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) reads as @xmath185 it is seen that for @xmath141 , the condition ( [ e3 - 28 ] ) is automatically violated and we get @xmath165 through the equation ( [ e3 - 27 ] ) , which indicates that there is no stable esu against the linear scalar perturbations for this rainbow function . for the second possibility as @xmath186 , with respect to the positivity of the spatial curvature due to the positive energy condition through equation ( [ e3 - 6 ] ) , we need that the barotropic eos parameter @xmath138 satisfies the condition @xmath158 .",
    "therefore , here we have a stable esu for the baratropic eos parameter @xmath158 , denoting the phantom matter fields , with the bounded energy density of esu @xmath168 as @xmath187 .",
    "as mentioned before , the existence of such constraint on energy density of esu may be absent in other modified gravity theories . here ,",
    "such a bound on initial density @xmath168 is arising from the energy dependent metric in gravity s rainbow proposal which is one of the common cut offs of quantum gravity theories .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that choosing the rainbow function ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) leads to the same result with gr so that a closed universe filled by usual non - relativistic matter fields , is not stable against small linear scalar perturbations .      in this subsection , we want to consider the possible modification by the cosmological constant @xmath0 and investigate its effects on stability condition of an esu . in presence of cosmological constant @xmath0 ,",
    "the second modified frw equation ( [ e2-b ] ) remain without change .",
    "but , the first modified frw equation ( [ e2-a ] ) and the conservation law ( [ e2-c ] ) , take the form of @xmath188 and @xmath189 one may consider another rainbow function as @xmath190 so that @xmath191 where @xmath86 is the usual cosmological constant . by this consideration ,",
    "the modified frw equation ( [ e3-a1 ] ) will be @xmath192 by setting this new rainbow function as @xmath193 , see second ref .",
    "of @xcite , for the esu described by @xmath194 , we get the following equation from equation ( [ e3-a1 ] ) as @xmath195 where @xmath196 is a dimensional parameter . by keeping positive energy condition",
    ", the above equation implies that positive spatial curvature @xmath140 , for two cases @xmath197 and @xmath198 , is guaranteed only under the following constraints , respectively @xmath199 and @xmath200 so that @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "with note to the our previous result on upper bounds on energy density of esu as @xmath203 , the above constraints reads as follows @xmath204 and @xmath205 in dgr formalism of gravity , it is expected that parameter @xmath196 to have the order of magnitude @xmath206 .",
    "as it seems , this value of @xmath196 be satisfied both the above constraints . also , in the presence of cosmological constant , we recover eq .",
    "( [ e3 - 7 ] ) from the second modified frw equation ( [ e2-b ] ) .",
    "similar to the previous analysis , by inserting equation ( [ e3 - 8 ] ) into the equation ( [ e3-a1 ] ) and neglecting the non - linear perturbation terms , we get @xmath207 it is seen that for the case of positive spatial curvature @xmath140 , the sing of variation of the scale factor @xmath208 is in contrast to the variation of matter density @xmath209 , provided that @xmath210 and @xmath211 where are related to the cases @xmath197 and @xmath198 , respectively . for the case of positive cosmological constant , @xmath197 , by comparing the constraints ( [ e3 - 301 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 32 ] ) , one realizes that constraint ( [ e3 - 301 ] ) can be satisfied via constraint ( [ e3 - 32 ] ) while its inverse is not true and so relation ( [ e3 - 32 ] ) will be a tighter constraint . with the same reason , one can say that for the case of negative cosmological constant , @xmath198 , constraint ( [ e3 - 302 ] ) is more tighter than ( [ e3 - 322 ] ) . finally ,",
    "by using equation ( [ e3 - 31 ] ) and considering equation ( [ e3 - 8 ] ) into the second modified frw equation ( [ e2-b ] ) , after neglecting the non - linear perturbation terms , we arrive to following differential equation @xmath212 by putting @xmath143 , the above differential equation takes the form of@xmath213 in order to have a stable esu against homogeneous and linear scalar perturbation described by the oscillatory modes , we have two possibilities as    * for the case of @xmath197 @xmath214 * for the case of @xmath198    @xmath215    now , in the same way as above by using the rainbow function ( [ e3 - 2 ] ) , by choosing the rainbow function ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) , we obtain the following differential equation @xmath216 where by inserting @xmath217 , coming from constraint ( [ e3 - 7 ] ) for the rainbow function ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) , it can be rewritten as @xmath218 this differential equation possesses the stable oscillatory modes under the following possibilities +    * the case of @xmath197 @xmath219 * the case of @xmath198    @xmath220    we note that since the cosmological constant does not appear in constraint equation ( [ e3 - 7 ] ) , the energy density of esu is bounded as @xmath167 or @xmath221 , for the both rainbow functions ( [ e3 - 2 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) . it is found that in order to have stable solutions for an esu in the presence of a cosmological constant , beside the cutoff on energy density @xmath168 , the conditions ( [ e3 - 35 ] ) , ( [ e3 - 36 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 39 ] ) , ( [ e3 - 40 ] ) for each of rainbow functions ( [ e3 - 2 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) , should also be satisfied respectively . for the case of positive cosmological constant @xmath197 , by comparing conditions mentioned in ( [ e3 - 35 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 39 ] ) with the constraint ( [ e3 - 32 ] ) , one realize that with choice of rainbow functions ( [ e3 - 2 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) , the solutions with @xmath222 and @xmath223 are allowed , respectively .",
    "for the case of negative cosmological constant @xmath198 , constraint ( [ e3 - 302 ] ) , is more tighter than ( [ e3 - 322 ] ) .",
    "in fact , we recall that the constraint ( [ e3 - 302 ] ) is important in the sense that with respect to physical energy condition in quantum gravity regimes , ensures that @xmath140 .",
    "so , it is clear that all the constraints on the parameter @xmath196 in ( [ e3 - 36 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 40 ] ) violate the constraint ( [ e3 - 302 ] ) .",
    "overall , this means that in the presence of a quantum gravity modifications such as what is done by gravity s rainbow , with respect to positive energy condition and positive spatial curvature @xmath224 which is one of the basic assumptions in modern version of emergent universe scenario , for the cosmological models possessing a negative cosmological constant , there is no stability for an esu .",
    "in the cosmological context , the vector perturbations of a perfect fluid having energy density @xmath59 and barotropic pressure @xmath85 are governed by the co - moving dimensionless _",
    "vorticity _ defined as @xmath225 .",
    "the vorticity modes satisfy the following propagation equation @xcite @xmath226 where @xmath227 and @xmath228 are the sound speed and the hubble parameter , respectively .",
    "this equation is valid in our treatment of einstein static universe in the framework of the rainbow gravity through the modified friedmann equations ( [ e2-a ] ) and ( [ e2-b ] ) . for the einstein static universe with @xmath229 , the equation ( [ v-1 ] ) reduces to @xmath230 where indicates that the initial vector perturbations remain frozen and consequently we have neutral stability against the vector perturbations .",
    "tensor perturbations , namely gravitational - wave perturbations , of a perfect fluid is described by the co - moving dimensionless transverse - traceless shear tensor @xmath231 , whose modes satisfy the following equation @xmath232\\sigma_{\\kappa}=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath233 is the co - moving index ( @xmath234 in which @xmath235 is the covariant spatial laplacian)@xcite . for the einstein static universe",
    "@xmath236 , this equation reduces to @xmath237\\sigma_{\\kappa}=0.\\ ] ] note that in the general tensor perturbation equation ( [ v-3 ] ) , the hubble parameter @xmath228 contains the rainbow function @xmath35 through equation ( [ e2-a ] ) .",
    "but , because for the einstein static universe we have @xmath229 , then the rainbow function @xmath35 did not appear in the equation ( [ v-4 ] ) . then , in order to have stable modes against the tensor perturbations , the following inequality should be satisfied @xmath238 where , for a closed universe with @xmath239 , considering the eigenvalue spectra @xmath240 with @xmath241 @xcite , will takes the form of @xmath242 this inequality gives a restriction on the scale factor of an esu in terms of its matter density and background cosmological constant . even though the existence of open and flat solutions are possible in some modified gravity models , in the present modified gravity model it is forbidden by regarding the weak energy condition .",
    "therefore , the stability analysis in the present model is restricted to the physically viable closed cosmological model .",
    "for the the eigenvalue spectra @xmath243 for open and flat models , one is referred to @xcite .",
    "according to a modern version of emergent cosmological scenario proposed by ellis and maartens @xcite , the early universe before passing to the inflationary phase , has experienced an eternal einstein static state rather than a big - bang singularity .",
    "more exactly , it refers to a static closed space in the asymptotic past ( before entering the universe to the period of inflation ) known as `` einstein static universe '' ( esu ) .",
    "the initial conditions as the quantum gravity effects in the early high energy universe , will influence the stability of this static state .",
    "for this reason , in the present work , we have examined the effects of an effective approach to quantum gravity proposed by magueijo and smolin @xcite , known as `` gravity s rainbow '' or `` doubly general relativity ( dgr ) '' , on the stability of the einstein static state against the linear homogeneous scalar , vector and tensor perturbations . in order to following our aim in the framework of dgr",
    ", we have needed to introduce appropriate rainbow functions .",
    "then , we have considered two appropriate well known rainbow functions ( [ e3 - 2 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) .",
    "first , by following the phase space mechanism represented in @xcite , we have investigated the fixed points belonging to a flat frw model which is modified by the presence of the rainbow function ( [ e3 - 2 ] ) . indeed , these fixed points are de sitter space solutions of typical flat rainbow frw model .",
    "our results indicate that although the needed time to get a fixed point is infinite , it may not lead to the elimination of the initial finite time singularities ( big - bang ) .",
    "this is because of the fact that the fixed points corresponding to past singularities ( big - bang ) are unstable and may be collapse .",
    "then , we studied the dgr theory in the context of the emergent universe scenario and tried to find its stable einstein static universe with the required conditions . in order to find a stable esu , as the first result",
    ", we realized that similar to standard gr scenario and independent of the choice of rainbow function , the positive spatial curvature @xmath140 , is the only option respecting to positive energy condition @xmath244 for an esu in the framework of the dgr theory .",
    "for the case of zero cosmological constant @xmath29 , we found that in order to achieve a stable esu against homogeneous and linear scalar perturbations , we need a conditions on the energy density of esu and the barotropic equation of state as @xmath143 and @xmath245 , respectively .",
    "similarly , for the rainbow function ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) , we also verified that big - bang singularity , can still exists . unlike the previous case ,",
    "the time needed to get the fixed point is not infinite in this case .",
    "furthermore , the only fixed point which is revealed in the presence of rainbow function ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) , is a future fixed point and is not a past fixed point .",
    "then , by looking at the dgr theory from the emergent universe point of view , we studied the stability of the einstein static universe and its required conditions . for this case , a stable solution for esu is guaranteed under these conditions @xmath246 and @xmath247 describing the exotic matter fields .",
    "as it is seen , stability conditions @xmath143 and @xmath248 are direct result from the idea of an energy dependent metric in the framework of gravity s rainbow scenario .",
    "these results are equivalent to an explicit cutoff on the energy density of an esu as @xmath167 and @xmath249 , respectively . given that , esu point out a initial static state ( or static closed space ) of universe before getting into inflationary phase , so the existence of such explicit cutoff ( or upper bounds ) on @xmath168 could be interpreted as a result of initial dominate quantum gravity effects such as `` gravity s rainbow '' . in the following of our analysis , we take an energy dependent cosmological constant via the introduction of new rainbow function as @xmath250 .",
    "it is seen that the positive spatial curvature , @xmath224 dictates an opposite sing for @xmath208 relative to energy density @xmath209 through the equation ( [ e3 - 31 ] ) .",
    "we find that in order to have stable solutions for an esu , beside the cutoff on energy density @xmath168 , the conditions ( [ e3 - 35 ] ) , ( [ e3 - 36 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 39 ] ) , ( [ e3 - 40 ] ) for each of rainbow functions ( [ e3 - 2 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) , should also be satisfied respectively . in particular , for the case of positive cosmological constant @xmath197 , by comparing conditions mentioned in ( [ e3 - 35 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 39 ] ) with the constraint ( [ e3 - 32 ] ) , one realize that with choice of rainbow functions ( [ e3 - 2 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 20 ] ) , the solutions with @xmath222 and @xmath223 are allowed , respectively .",
    "for the case of negative cosmological constant @xmath198 , constraint ( [ e3 - 302 ] ) , is more tighter than ( [ e3 - 322 ] ) .",
    "in fact , we recall that the constraint ( [ e3 - 302 ] ) is important in the sense that with respect to physical energy condition in quantum gravity regimes , ensures that @xmath140 .",
    "so , it is clear that all the constraints on the parameter @xmath196 in ( [ e3 - 36 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 40 ] ) violate the constraint ( [ e3 - 302 ] ) . overall , this means that in the presence of a quantum gravity modifications such as what is done by gravity s rainbow , with respect to positive energy condition and positive spatial curvature @xmath224 which is one of the basic assumptions in modern version of emergent universe scenario , for cosmological models with a negative cosmological constant , there is no stability for an esu . finally , we investigated the the stability of an esu in the framework of dgr versus vector and tensor perturbations .",

    "<S> then , we follow the `` emergent universe '' scenario in which there is no beginning of time and consequently there is no big - bang singularity . moreover , we study the impact of a high energy quantum gravity modifications related to the gravity s rainbow on the stability conditions of an `` einstein static universe '' ( esu ) . we find that independent of a particular rainbow function , the positive energy condition dictates a positive spatial curvature for the universe . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , without raising a nonphysical energy condition in the quantum gravity regimes , we can address an agreement between gravity s rainbow scenario and basic assumption of modern version of `` emergent universe '' . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the absence and presence of an energy - dependent cosmological constant @xmath0 , a stable einstein static solution is available versus the homogeneous and linear scalar perturbations under the variety of obtained conditions . also , we explore the stability of esu against the vector and tensor perturbations . </S>",
