    "it is well - known that the solar p - mode frequencies vary with the solar cycle @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the variations of the frequencies are significantly related to magnetic activities near the solar surface @xcite . however , a number of attempts have been made to detect the relation between the frequency shifts and the variation of the solar interior .",
    "it has been proposed that the frequency shifts may relate to changes taking place in the base of the convection zone @xcite , or in the deep core @xcite .",
    "low - degree p - modes can be used to study the solar core because they can penetrate the deep interior @xcite . however ,",
    "even these modes are primarily sensitive to the solar envelope structure .",
    "thus frequency separations are proposed for a diagnostic tool .",
    "the frequency separations of low - degree p - modes in solar - like stars often proposed for diagnostic purposes are large separations @xmath1 and small separations @xmath2 .",
    "the large separations approximate to the characteristic frequency @xmath3 of a star , defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 in which @xmath6 is sound speed at radius @xmath7 and @xmath8 is some fiducial radius of the star .",
    "the small separations are sensitive to the structure of stellar core @xcite , defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the internal phase shift .",
    "for the low - degree p - modes , the @xmath10 is mainly dependent on conditions in the stellar core and is almost independent of those outside the core @xcite .",
    "these frequency separations have been extensively investigated by many authors @xcite .",
    "additionally @xcite defines differences @xmath11 as @xmath12 and @xcite define differences @xmath13 of low - degree p - modes as @xmath14 the differences @xmath15 are similar to the scaled small separations @xmath16 in some cases and are mainly sensitive to conditions in stellar core .",
    "the difference @xmath17 averaged over @xmath18 is , however , more sensitive to changes in the central hydrogen abundance of solar - like stars than the scaled small separations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ratios @xmath19 are considered to be essentially independent of the structure of the outer layers of a star and determined by interior structures @xcite .",
    "the ratios @xmath20 and @xmath21 also mainly rely on the interior structures @xcite .",
    "thus changes in stellar interior could be indicated by the variations in these separation ratios .",
    "however frequency variations with solar activity are relative to the angular ( @xmath22 ) degree , the azimuthal ( @xmath23 ) degree , and the order @xmath18 . the @xmath23-dependence is attributed to the solar near - surface activity @xcite and could be removed by using the frequency centroids which incorporate all the @xmath23 components of a mode @xcite . for the low - degree p - modes ,",
    "centroid shifts can be regarded as being @xmath22-independent @xcite .",
    "thus separations of frequency centroids of low - degree p - modes should be insensitive to effects of surface activity . using the p - modes of the birmingham solar - oscillations network ( bison ) collecting data using a sun - as - a - star technique ,",
    "@xcite studied the impact of the solar activity cycle on the frequency separation ratios and found that the ratios change with the shifting level of global solar activity .",
    "@xcite pointed out that some @xmath23 components are suppressed in the sun - as - a - star observations and hence the ratios are expected to be affected by the surface activity . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the variations of frequency separations of low - degree p - modes as solar activity cycle proceeds using data collected by the resolved - sun observations . in section 2",
    "we present our data and results",
    ". then discussion and conclusion are represented in section 3 .",
    "in this work , we used the solar p - mode frequencies of the gong @xcite to study the separations .",
    "the gong was planned for measurements of medium and high spherical degrees , but low - degree p - modes can be measured too .",
    "@xcite showed that the low - l p - modes of the gong are in good agreement with that of the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) and the global oscillations at low frequency ( golf ) .",
    "the raw data of gong are measured in a time series of 36 days labeled a gong month .",
    "a 108-day time series is constructed by concatenating 3 consecutive gong - month time series .",
    "gong month mode frequencies ( gmfs ) were then estimated from the 108-day spectra @xcite . in the observation of gong ,",
    "the solar disk is imaged onto many pixels .",
    "the obtained images can then be decomposed into their constituent spherical harmonics . for each degree @xmath22 and overtone @xmath18 , this imaging strategy provides access to all @xmath24 components with each being tagged by an azimuthal degree @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the frequencies , @xmath25 , extracted from resolved - sun observations are usually represented by @xmath26 where @xmath27 are polynomials related to clebsch - gordan coefficients @xcite and @xmath28 is the so - called central frequency of the multiplet ( i.e. frequency centroid ) . using the polynomials @xmath27 given by @xcite and equation ( [ num ] )",
    ", one can get the central frequency of low - degree p - modes of the resolved - sun observations , @xmath29 the central frequencies are sensitive to the spherically symmetric component of the internal structure of a star and are usually used as inputs to inversions of the internal structure @xcite .    in order to study the variations of frequency separations with the solar activity cycle",
    ", we used the gmfs observed between 1996 and 2007 .",
    "centroids @xmath30 and individual frequencies @xmath25 of the gmfs were published by the gong team .",
    "some centroids @xmath30 published are inconsecutive in the order @xmath18 , especially for the modes with @xmath22 = 1 , but the frequencies @xmath25 are consecutive . in order to obtain separations , we used the averages @xmath28 of all @xmath31 + 1 components of each mode instead of the centroids @xmath30 . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we compared the averages obtained using equation ( [ centf ] ) with the available centroids estimated by the gong team .",
    "the differences between the frequencies obtained using equation ( [ centf ] ) and the available gong centroids are almost much less than the errors of the gong centroids in the range of 2400 @xmath32hz @xmath33 3500 @xmath32hz * except a few modes , whose differences are close to the errors of the gong centroids*. in this range , the averages obtained using equation ( [ centf ] ) are good consistent with the centroids estimated by the gong team .",
    "all the following frequency separations are obtained from the averages .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows fractional changes of the separation ratios in two sets of gmfs , one at a low level and one at a high level of activity .",
    "the error bars indicate 1 @xmath0 errors , which were propagated from uncertainties on the individual frequencies of the gmfs .",
    "the departure of the separation ratios from the null level is within 1 @xmath0 but shows a systematic shift , which is consistent with the prediction of the 108 day spectra of @xcite ( in their figure 1 ) .",
    "however , just as the observed shifts of ratios of the bison frequencies @xcite , ` the shifts are clearly not significant for individual estimates of the ratios ' . in the interest of temporal variations of separations , for each set of separations with the same degree @xmath22 , we averaged the separations over @xmath18 in the range of 2400 @xmath32hz @xmath34 3500 @xmath32hz , which was implied by symbols @xmath35 .",
    "the frequency range is often used to obtain a mean frequency shift @xcite .",

    "the results were obtained from the data between @xmath36 2001 and 2007 .    in order to further understand the variations of separations with the solar activity , figure [ fig4 ] shows separations plotted against f10 in the ascending phase of solar activity .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows that the separations almost not vary with activity .",
    "the results of linear least - squares fits between the separations and f10 are summarized in the left panel of table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the magnitudes of variations of these separations are only about 0.04 @xmath32hz , which is less than 1 @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , figure [ fig5 ] shows that the changes of the large separations with the f10 in the descending phase of the solar activity .",
    "the shifts of the large separations are also less than 1 @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] also shows the variations of small separations with the f10 during @xmath36 2004 - 2007 . in this period of time , the changes of these separations with the f10 are obvious and systematic .",
    "however , the magnitudes of variations of these separations are around 1 @xmath0 or more . the results of linear fits between the separations and f10 are shown in the right panel of table [ tab2 ] .    in figure [ fig6 ] , we show the temporal variations of separation ratios @xmath37 ,",
    "@xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . the results of linear fits between the ratios and time are presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the changes of the ratios with time are similar to those of the corresponding small separations . in the ascending phase of solar activity , shifts of the ratios are less than 1 @xmath0 . in the descending phase of activity , from @xmath36 2004 to 2007 ,",
    "the changes of the ratios with time are systematic .",
    "however , the magnitudes of the changes are still roughly 1 @xmath0 or more .",
    "since the fractional changes of the large separations are much less than those of small separations during the activity , the contribution to the changes in the ratios from the variations of the large separations is much less than that from the small separations .",
    "the effects of the changes in the large separations on the changes in the ratios are almost negligible .",
    "the changes in the ratios with time are mainly determined by the changes in the small separations .",
    "the magnitudes of temporal variations for some individual separations are very large but should not be significant . in the ascending phase of the solar activity , the magnitudes of variations of separations , obtained from regression equations , are about 0.04 @xmath32hz , which is less than 1 @xmath0 . during @xmath36 2004 - 2007 ,",
    "the changes in separations are systematic .",
    "however , the magnitudes of the changes are roughly 1 @xmath0 or more . using bison data , @xcite",
    "show that variations of the separation ratios between low and high activity is at a marginal level of significance .",
    "moreover , using simple averages , from the gradient of mean frequency shift of the mdi given by @xcite in their table 1 , one can get a shift gradient in the centroids would be 1.61 and 2.02 nhz / sfu for @xmath22 = 0 and 2 respectively . for a 120 sfu increase in solar activity , the change in separation @xmath41 would then be about 0.05 @xmath32hz , which is consistent with our result .",
    "the characteristic frequency @xmath3 , i.e. the large separation , is an integral property of the entire star . because the solar sound speed is a decreasing function of the solar radius , the contribution to @xmath3 from the outer layers of the sun is larger than that from the solar inner regions @xcite .",
    "thus the large separation should be more sensitive to the changes in the outer layers than those in the inner regions and could be affected by the near surface activity .",
    "moreover small separations are more sensitive to the conditions in stellar interior than those in outer layers .",
    "thus the large separations should be more sensitive to the activity than the small separations .",
    "however , in fact , the magnitudes of variations of the large separations are about 0.07 @xmath32hz during the activity , which is less than 1 @xmath0 .",
    "the magnitude of variations of @xmath41 is also less than 1 @xmath0 over the activity cycle .",
    "however , other small separations show a systematic shift during @xmath36 2004 - 2007 , and the magnitudes of their variations are roughly 1 @xmath0 or more .",
    "small separations @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 show a sudden change between 2001 and 2002",
    ". the fractional changes shown in figure [ fig2 ] of ratios in two gmfs ( one in 1996 and one in 2001 ) are consistent with the prediction of @xcite . however",
    ", if we use the data of 2002 instead of the data of 2001 , the results would be different .",
    "the small separations show different behaviors in the ascending and descending phases of the cycle . in the ascending phase ,",
    "variations of the small separations are less than 1 @xmath0 . in the descending phase ,",
    "the small separations show a systematic shift during 2004 - 2007 . and",
    "the magnitudes of the changes in @xmath45 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are roughly 1 @xmath0 or more .",
    "it is not clear whether the variations are caused by the systematic errors in measurements .",
    "the large separations increase slightly with increasing of the solar activity .",
    "but the magnitudes of temporal variations of the mean large separations of the low - degree p - modes are only about 0.07 @xmath32hz over the activity cycle , which is less than 1 @xmath0 .",
