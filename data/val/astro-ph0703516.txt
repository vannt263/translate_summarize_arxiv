    "the modern use of star counts in the study galatic structure began with bahcall & soneira ( 1980 ) . in bahcall",
    "s standard model , the structure of the galaxy is assumed to be an exponential disk and a de vaucouleurs spheriodal halo .",
    "a lot of work has been done to constrain and examine this theoretical model , as summarised in xu , deng & hu ( 2006 ) ( xdh06 here after ) , most of them using only a small sky area .",
    "the global structure of the galactic halo can only be inferred by different observations of small sky areas with different magnitude limits , photometric passbands and different original observational goals .",
    "sdss provides us with the opportunity to examine the large scale structure of the galaxy from optical photometry thanks to its deep photometry and large sky coverage . from sdss",
    "observational data it is clear that the stellar halo of the galaxy is aymmetric , contrary to what has been generally assumed . from colour star counts it is obvious that the asymmetric projected stellar number density is produced by halo stars .",
    "there are two possible explanations for such a halo structure .",
    "firstly , that there are some large scale star streams embedded in the axi - symmetric smooth structure of the galactic halo ( juri et al .",
    "2005 ) . secondly ,",
    "that the galactic stellar halo is intrinsically not axi - symmetric ( newberg & yanny 2005 ; xdh 2006 ) .",
    "based on the data we have so far , some combination of the two might also be possible .",
    "in paper i , we tested the second option and fitted the observational data with triaxial halo .",
    "the triaxial halo model fits fairly well the projected number density near the northern cap of the galactic stellar halo .",
    "however , in some sky areas , the triaxial halo model can not reproduce the actual star counts .",
    "the multi - solutions that are intrinsic in fitting the observational data with the triaxial halo model make the interpretation of the data somewhat difficult . on the other hand",
    ", the alternative option where the asymmetry of the halo is caused by large scale star streams also has some problems , even if the overwhelmingly large virgo overdensity that covers nearly a quarter of the northern hemisphere can be explained by a large scale star stream .",
    "the observed underdensity near ursa major with respect to the assumed axi - symmetric halo still challenges such a picture .",
    "nevertheless , the conservation of such a huge structure in the gravitational well of the galaxy certainly needs to be verified .",
    "martnez - delgado et al . ( 2006 ) show that the virgo overdensity can be reproduced by the dynamical evolution of the sgr stream . assuming a certain structure of the stellar halo ( an oblate ellipse )",
    ", their numerical simulation can predict an overdensity on a few hundred square degree scale .",
    "although it is the most advanced photometric sky survey in terms of depth and data quality , sdss does not have good data coverage near the southern cap of the galaxy which is , of course , crucial in understanding the overall structure of the stellar halo .",
    "limited to the sky coverage of sdss photometry database , it is probably premature to draw a firm conclusion on the stellar halo structure . assuming that the galactic stellar halo is non axi - symmetric , and can be described by a triaxial model",
    ", there must be some corresponding evidence in the southern hemisphere similar to what is found in xdh06 for the northern cap . in the axisymmetric halo model",
    ", the maximum star counts should be at longitude @xmath7 ( due to the location of the observer ) . in the case of a triaxial halo ,",
    "however , the maximum projected number density also depends on a certain parameters of the halo including azimuth angle , axial ratios and the limiting magnitudes of the observations . in the simplest case ,",
    "the plane defined by the primary and the middle axis of the triaxial halo stays in the galactic disk , the azimuth angle is only related with the angle between the primary axis and the direction of the galactic center from the sun , therefore the expected star counts and asymmetric ratio of northern and southern sky ought to be mirror symmetric with respect to the galactic plane , i.e. what was found in the north cap should also be found in the south under such a halo model .",
    "if the two planes do not overlap , the situation will be more complicated , but similar results should still hold .",
    "it is also interesting to examine archived sky survey data that has the good coverage and reasonable quality in the southern galactic halo : the photographic photometry of supercosmos is ideal for this purpose . as reviewed by hambly et al .",
    "( 2001a ) , photographic observations for the galaxy started in the late nineteenth century .",
    "in the 1930s , the development of schmidt telescopes with wide fields of view further advanced photographic surveys .",
    "the 1.2-m palomar oschin , 1.0-m eso and 1.2-m uk schmidt telescopes finished the photographic whole sky survey in the last century , such surveys form a legacy library for examining the structure of the galaxy . in the late twentieth century",
    ", the photographic plates were eventually digitized using microdensitometry and digital electronics machines .",
    "there are several major programs to digitize the photographic plates , of which supercosmos is one . in",
    "hambly et al .",
    "( 2001a ) , a general overview of these programmes ( apm , aps , cosmos , dss , pmm , supercosmos ) is presented .",
    "the digitized photographic sky survey of supercosmos provides a catalog of three bands , namely blue(@xmath0 ) , red(@xmath3 ) and near - infrared(@xmath8 ) , which have deeper detection limit for the same detection completeness compared to other similar survey programs ( see fig2 of hambly et al .",
    "we therefore adopt the supercosmos data archive for our present study .    in section 2 ,",
    "the observational data are described and the stellar source cross identification between the supercosmos data and the sdss data is carried out , and the viability of using supercosmos data to study the structure of southern galactic stellar halo is discussed . in section 3,downgraded sdss and supercosmos observational of star counts results are presented . in section 4 , the model fits to the supercosmos star counts are introduced . in section 5 ,",
    "the supercosmos observational data and theoretical models are compared , and supercosmos southern sky star counts and sdss downgraded northern sky star counts also compared and analyzed . in section 6 , the result of star counts is summarized .",
    "the supercosmos sky survey is a digitized photography sky survey .",
    "it is described in detail in a series of papers by hambly and collaborators ( hambly et al .",
    "2001a ; hambly , irwin & macgillivray 2001b ; hambly , davenhall & irwin 2001c ) .    the supercosmos photography atlas of the supercosmos sky survey includes blue(@xmath0 ) , red(@xmath3 ) , and near infrared(@xmath8 ) passband photometric survies carried out by uk schmidt survey for @xmath9 , eso red survey of @xmath10 , and palomar surveies including , poss - i red survey for @xmath11 , poss - ii blue survey for @xmath12 , poss - ii red survey for @xmath12 .",
    "data of @xmath0 band has 90% or about detection completeness from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , and that of @xmath3 band has same completeness from @xmath1 to @xmath4 mag .",
    "the photometric data has a magnitude error of @xmath13 , but color is accurate to about @xmath14(hambly et al .",
    "2001a ) .",
    "there are two interface applications of supercosmos : the supercosmos sky survey ( http:// www-wfau.roe.ac.uk/sss , sss hereafter ) and the supercosmos sky archive ( http:// surveys.roe.ac.uk/ssa , ssa hereafter ) .",
    "images of small sky areas and catalogs from the supercosmos sky survey can be downloaded .",
    "we thank the supercosmos working group who made all the data available to the community .",
    "the ssa only includes photometric data from ukst and eso .",
    "as made clear by hambly et al.(2001a ) , although the entire sky is digitized , the data in this archive is released progressively .",
    "the total amount of data is enormous , only f type stars ( selected by 0.504 @xmath15 0.8236 ) from @xmath16 to @xmath17 are adopted to show the sky coverage which is in the upper panel of figure 1 .",
    "the survey covers most of the high latitude southern sky , and a little of the northern hemisphere .",
    "the clump at ( l , b)=(@xmath18 ) is the smc , and the clump at ( l , b)=(@xmath19 ) is the lmc .",
    "except for the difference in sky coverage , the two interface applications use different selection standards .",
    "the ssa sql selection is much more configurable ( private communication by email with hambly ) than that of the sss .",
    "for example , there are 4 kinds of b magnitude in the ssa , namely classmagb ( b band magnitude selected by b image class ) , gcormagb ( b band magnitude assuming the object is a galaxy ) , scormagb(b band magnitude assuming the object is a star ) , classb ( image classification from b band detection ) .",
    "the most appropriate attribute for point sources is scormag , while the most possible class of an object from all three bands is provided by parameter `` meanclass '' .",
    "the sss only includes selection parameters applied to the primary passband , coresponding to classb of the ssa in the example .",
    "our aim is to count the stars in each selected sky area , and using classb will lose some stars due to not synthesizing information of all the three bands .",
    "this will influence the result of star counts seriously .",
    "so  scormagb \" of the ssa data is selected to carry out the study and the  meanclass \" is limited to 2(star label ) .",
    "because the ssa only covers limited sky areas of high latitude northern galactic hemisphere ( upper panel of figure 1 ) we can not directly compare supercosmos star counts of northern sky with those of sdss .",
    "the ssa includes @xmath3 band data from both ukst and eso .",
    "however data from the @xmath3 band of ukst is deeper than that of eso .",
    "therefore , only ukst is adopted .",
    "the detailed instrumental specifications of ukst can be found in cannon ( 1984 ) , the main parameters of the survey telescope and instruments are listed in table 1 .    [ cols= \"",
    "> , > \" , ]     as well as calculating the stellar projected number density , we also compare the theoretical and the observational star counts in apparent magnitude bin for each sky area .",
    "figure 8 shows , as an example , the observational ( gray diamond ) and the theoretical ( dark line ) star counts in 12 sky areas of @xmath20 , the galactic coordinates of each sky area are indicated in the corresponding panel .",
    "as shown in these plots , the theoretical model can fit observation data fairly well , but with a few exceptions .",
    "in ( @xmath21 ) and ( @xmath22 ) at the bin of @xmath23 to @xmath2 , the theoretical value is higher than the observational one .",
    "similar to what is shown in figures 6 and 7 , the distribution of star counts in apparent magnitude also fits fairly well a homogeneous axisymmetric structure .",
    "using equation ( 4 ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 for each parameter grid can be obtained .",
    "the contour plots of @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the n - q plane are presented in figure 9 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath24 is 1.53 , and the maximum is 11.915 , while the values for @xmath25 are 0.939 and 3.424 respectively , 20 levels of contours are used .",
    "the inner - most ( smallest values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) contour indicates the best fitting combinations n and q. the open diamonds in both panels of figure 9 indicate the most favorable parameters given by both @xmath24 and @xmath25 minimizations , which are listed in table 7 .",
    "the fitting of the observed projected number density using one of the best combinations ( n=2.8 , q=0.7 ) is shown in figure 6 .      in the previous subsection ,",
    "the southern sky projected surface number density of supercosmos @xmath0 band data is fitted by an axisymmetric stellar halo model . as discussed above , star counts of the northern sky show asymmetric structure due to an excess of halo stars for @xmath26 ( see xdh06 for details ) .",
    "the presence of the same feature in the southern sky is the main concern of this paper .    to answer this question ,",
    "we need to compare the distribution of number density in the north from the downgraded sdss data and that of supercosmos data in the south .",
    "singling - out the halo population from star counts is now required . with the data we have",
    ", the halo and disc populations can only be roughly distinguished through colors based on photometric data .",
    "supercosmos @xmath3 band data has only an 85% coincidence with sdss data , which makes our analysis somewhat less accurate .",
    "however , this factor only affects the total number of stars that can be used in statistics in color , and will raise the level of random error in the final result . further to this aim , @xmath3 band data is still again used to obtain the star counts in color .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows the projected number density of sdss downgraded data of @xmath27 and supercosmos data of @xmath28 .",
    "both data sets are constrained by @xmath0 and @xmath3 band magnitude limits ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) .",
    "black points and gray points represent supercosmos data for @xmath28 and sdss downgraded data for @xmath27 respectively . to show the difference clearly , a 6th order polynomial function is used to fit for each data set .",
    "the sdss downgraded data are systematically higher than supercosmos data .",
    "there are two possible reasons for this : firstly , a systematic deviation between the two systems ; secondly , an intrinsic difference between the north and the south . from @xmath7 to @xmath31 , the two curves have similar shape , showing a possible systematic deviation between the two systems . while from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , data set for @xmath27 shows an obvious excess over that of @xmath28 after considering the systematic deviation .",
    "the largest excess appear around @xmath34 , coincident with the virgo overdensity ( newberg & yanny .",
    "2005 ; juri et al .",
    "2005 ; xdh06 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] shows the projected surface number density in @xmath35 color space for @xmath36 ( the gray line of upper panel ) & @xmath37 ( the black line of upper panel ) , and @xmath38 ( the gray line of lower panel ) & @xmath39 ( the black line of lower panel ) . in the upper panel ,",
    "the distribution of sdss downgraded data in color shows the same property as that in xdh06 , the halo populations ( blue peak ) in the sky areas @xmath26 have an excess over those @xmath40 , while the disk populations ( the red peak ) are basically the same .",
    "the lower panel shows that both the sdss downgraded data and the supercosmos data sitting at two opposite sides of the galactic plane have a double peak structure in color space .",
    "the disk population in the two sky areas has similar number density while the northern sky star counts of halo population have larger numbers than those in the southern sky . in figure",
    "[ fig10 ] , the systematic deviation between the two curves is caused by the difference in photometric sensitivity limits between the two systems .",
    "the reason is quite straightforward : the fainter stars between the photometric limits of supercomos and that of sdss are surely absent from supercosmos statistics , while possibly being present in sdss catalog .",
    "the lowest number density of star counts in color appears for @xmath41 .",
    "the disk population and the halo population can be roughly separated by this limit ( @xmath42 for the disk population , and @xmath43 for the halo population ) .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] demonstrates the difference between the selected populations in the north ( downgraded sdss data ) and in the south ( supercosmos data ) .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig12 ] shows the difference between the density of the halo population of sky areas along the @xmath27 circle and that of the @xmath28 circle .",
    "the lower panel is the same as the upper one but for the disk population .",
    "it is clear that the difference in disk population in the lower panel ( the southern galactic cap ) has a random distribution around 0 , the amplitude of such fluctuations is lower than about 40 with no systematic feature ; while the difference in halo population in the upper panel has obvious features of over 200 .",
    "the systematic deviations between the sdss downgraded data and the supercosmos data are clearly caused by halo stars , i.e. the halo population in the north has a certain amount of excess over that in the south .",
    "clearly , there is a prominent excess in the range of @xmath44360@xmath45 .",
    "this shows that there is an overdensity only in the north , while no such features are found in the southern supercosmos data .",
    "from sdss data covering the northern cap , it has been found that the northern halo is not axisymmetric ( newberg & yanny 2005 ; juri et al . 2005 ; xdh06 ) .",
    "this feature is also visible at shallower magnitude limits ( ie .",
    "closer halo stars ) in sdss data downgraded to the limit of supercosmos .",
    "the main goal of this work was to examine the halo structure near the southern cap of the galaxy using supercosmos data .",
    "we show that the southern halo structure does not have a similar asymmetry to the northern galactic cap for the same magnitude limits .    in xdh06 , using very deep sdss photometry from 15mag- 22mag ,",
    "the asymmetry ratio goes up to 23% .",
    "the magnitude limit of supercosmos data is from @xmath1-@xmath2 for @xmath0 band and @xmath1-@xmath4 for @xmath3 band . converting the sdss data to the same photometry system and considering @xmath46 in the same magnitude range ,",
    "the asymmetric structure is weakened but still detectible , as demonstrated by the asymmetry ratios and their errors in tables  [ tab2 ] ( also see [ tab4 ] for @xmath47 ) , the asymmetric ratio only pickes up to @xmath48 . from supercosmos data in the south ,",
    "star counts shows no asymmetry feature , as shown in tables  [ tab3 ] ( also [ tab5 ] for @xmath3 ) , this is of course linked to the uncertainties in the data .",
    "the rms is over 7.8% for asymmetry ratio measured in @xmath0 .",
    "concerning the error of star counts of supercosmos @xmath0 band data , there are three sources contributing .",
    "firstly , the supercosmos data of @xmath0 band has 92@xmath4993% identification rate when cross - correlating with sdss data , this gives a error of 8% , at the worst case , in number counts .",
    "secondly , the supercosmos data has an overall photometry uncertainty of @xmath13 , which creates an error of 3.7% in the results of star counts , as derived from monte carlo simulations .",
    "thirdly , the sdss photometry is far more accurate than that of supercosmos , therefore it can be regarded as the precise system to compare with the later one .",
    "therefore we assume that the statistical fluctuations measured in xdh06 are the intrinsic stellar density fluctuations in the halo , which are 2.53% on average for number counts . putting these factors together",
    ", we can estimate the average error in supercosmos star counts as ,    @xmath50    having such an uncertainty in star counts for supercosmos data , and considering the level of asymmetry of @xmath48 , it is not possible to draw a firm conclusion for the symmetry issue for the stellar halo near the south cap , when there is only supercosmos data available .",
    "however , when analyzing the population statistics using colors , distinct properties of stellar halo structures in the north and south can be found . as shown in figure  [ fig12 ] , the halo population shows an apparent excess around @xmath34 in the north ( the upper panel ) as from the downgraded sdss data , while the same plot for the south gives only random fluctuations of the same level as statistical errors .",
    "we attempt to fit triaxial halo models to both downgraded sdss and supercosmos data . by directly applying models in xdh06 ,",
    "no good fit can be derived , because no obvious overdensity such as the virgo one in the north is found in the south . however",
    ", this does not exclude the possibility to have a triaxial halo after removing the large scale star streams .",
    "due to large photometric uncertainties and low sensitvity of supercosmos , an error in star counts around 9.17% prevents us from making a clear conclusion on this point .",
    "therefore , the present work can be concluded as the following :    1 .",
    "supercosmos data ( ssa ) has been used to study the structure of stellar halo covering the southern galactic cap .",
    "direct star counts reveal that the structure can be fitted by a axi - symmetric halo model .",
    "limited by the photometric error and depth of the survey , no asymmetry can be detected by star counts .",
    "2 .   an asymmetric structure , very similar to what have been found using sdss survey data ( newberg & yanny 2005 ; juri et al .",
    "2005 ; xdh06 ) can be detected by downgrading sdss data to the limiting magnitudes and photometric error of supercosmos .",
    "a halo population excess , defined by ( @xmath43 ) , is responsible for the asymmetry structure found in the north in downgraded sdss data , as revealed by both direct star counts ( figures  [ fig4][fig8 ] , [ fig10 ] ) and statistics in color ( figures  [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] ) . while for the southern cap , no such features are present .",
    "4 .   considering the overall symmetry of the galactic halo ,",
    "the asymmetry discovered in the north ( the virgo overdensity ) is likely to be a foreign component in the stellar halo of the galaxy .",
    "however , due to a lack of good photometric data , an asymmetry in the stellar halo near the south cap beyond supercosmos limits can not be ruled out .",
    "it is still an open question if we have a triaxial halo with large scale star streams embedded .",
    "5 .   for the structure of stellar halo near the southern cap",
    ", supercomos data can not go any further .",
    "better quality survey data of the sdss quality is needed to adress these issues .",
