    "during the last couple of decades there has been a considerable research activities in understanding issues both in cosmology and in astrophysics in the framework of higher dimensions .",
    "particularly the results obtained in the usual four dimensions are generalized in higher dimensions in addition to new physics .",
    "the history of higher dimensions goes back to the work done by kaluza and klein in the past @xcite .",
    "kaluza and klein independently first introduced the concept of extra dimension in addition to the usual four dimensions to unify gravitational interaction with that of electromagnetic interaction .",
    "the theory is essentially an extension of einstein general theory of relativity ( henceforth , gtr ) in five dimensions which is of much interest in particle physics as well as in cosmology .",
    "but the initial approach does not work well .",
    "a couple of decades ago the study of higher dimensional theories has been revived once again and it was considerably generalized after realizing that many interesting theories of particle interactions need more than four dimensions for their consistent formulation . on the other hand ,",
    "gtr was formulated in a space - time with just four dimensions .",
    "thus if some of the theories of particle interactions are consistent in higher dimensions , it is natural to look for the generalization of the theories developed in the usual four dimensions .",
    "it became important to generalize the results obtained in four dimensional gtr in the higher dimensional context and probe the effects due to incorporation of one or more than one extra space - time dimensions in the theory . in this direction chodos and",
    "detweiler @xcite first obtained a higher dimensional cosmological model and thereafter a number of cosmological models in higher dimensions have been discussed in the literature @xcite to address different issues not understood in the usual four dimensions .",
    "in cosmology it is proposed that a higher dimensional universe might undergo a spontaneous compactification leading to a product space @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the compact inner space , describing the present universe satisfactorily .",
    "thereafter the advent of string theory @xcite particularly a viable description of superstring theory in 10 dimensions led to a spurt in activities in higher dimensions .",
    "the work of randall and sundrum @xcite led to a paradigm shift in understanding the compactification mechanism .",
    "randall and sundrum gave an interesting picture of gravity in which the extra dimensions is not compact and it is possible to recover the usual four dimensional newtonian gravity from a five dimensional anti - de sitter space - time in the low energy limit .",
    "in the context of localized sources in astrophysics , higher dimensional versions of the spherically symmetric schwarzschild and reissner - n@xmath5rdstrom black holes @xcite , kerr black holes @xcite , black holes in compactified space - time @xcite , no - hair theorem @xcite , hawking radiation @xcite , vaidya solution @xcite have been generalized .",
    "shen and tan @xcite also obtained a global regular solution of higher dimensional schwarzschild space - time .",
    "the mass to radius ratio in higher dimensions for a uniform density star is determined which is a genaralization of the four dimensions and new results have been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "the consequences of extra dimensions in understanding the structure of neutron stars employig kaluza - klein model was investigated by liddle _",
    "the model is constructed making use of a five dimensional energy - momentum tensor described by perfect fluid .",
    "the four dimensional version of the theory is found to have a perfect fluid with a scalar source .",
    "the effect of the source term is found very large which leads to a substantial lower value in the mass of neutron star associated with a particular central density .    in astrophysics , it is known from recent observational prediction that there exist a number of compact objects whose masses and radii are not compatible with the standard neutron star models . as densities of such compact objects",
    "are normally above the nuclear matter density , theoretical studies hints that pressure within such compact objects are likely to be anisotropic , _",
    "i.e. _ , existence of two different kinds of interior pressures namely , the radial pressure and the tangential pressure @xcite .",
    "a number of literature @xcite came up where the solutions of einstein s field equations with anisotropic fluid distribution on different space - time geometries are discussed .",
    "the role of pressure anisotropy is studied in the context of high - redshift values including the stability of compact objects ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "bowers and liang @xcite obtained the corresponding change in the limiting values of the maximum mass of compact stars in the presence of anisotropy .",
    "recently , the maximum mass of an isotropic compact object and that of an anisotropic one in the context of vaidya - tikekar model obtained by karmakar _",
    "@xcite in four dimension making use of general relativistic solution obtained by mukherjee _",
    "it may be mentioned here that a higher dimensional generalization of the relativistic solution obtained by mukherjee _",
    "@xcite has been generalized by one of us ( @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we estimate the maximum mass limit of an anisotropic compact object making use of the above general relativistic solution in higher dimensions . in this case",
    "we consider space - time geometry describe by a metric ansatz given by vaidya and tikekar @xcite .",
    "the technique adopted here is different from that usually considered in obtaining relativistic solution from einstein s field equation .",
    "usually for a known equation of state ( in short , eos ) of matter one obtains solution for the geometry .",
    "but in the case of compact objects the equation of state of matter inside a compact object is not yet known except some phenomenological assumptions . in this case making use of a known geometry for compact objects in hydrostatic equilibrium in higher dimensional gtr we explore different physical features of the compact objects .",
    "it helps to determine both the mass and radius of compact objects in terms of geometrical parameters as was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in four dimensions .",
    "we also predict the relevant eos for a given configuration known from observations .",
    "the eos obtained here satisfies a non linear equation .",
    "it may be mentioned here that similar non - linear eos have been employed by mafa takisa and maharaj @xcite to obtain stellar models for compact objects .",

    "[ phy ] the role of anisotropy is studied and estimated the probable maximum mass for the class of solutions obtained in section [ max ] .",
