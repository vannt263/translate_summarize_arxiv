    "the present acceleration of the universe expansion has been well established through numerous and complementary cosmological observations @xcite . a component which is responsible for this accelerated expansion usually dubbed `` dark energy '' ( de ) . however , the nature of de is still unknown , and people have proposed some candidates to describe it ( for review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the important questions in cosmology concerns the thermodynamical behavior of the accelerated expanding universe driven by de .",
    "it was shown that the einstein equation can be derived from the first law of thermodynamics by assuming the proportionality of entropy and the horizon area @xcite . in the cosmological context , attempts to disclose the connection between einstein gravity and thermodynamics were carried out .",
    "it was shown that the differential form of the friedmann equation in the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe can be written in the form of the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon @xcite .",
    "further studies on the equivalence between the first law of thermodynamics and friedmann equation has been investigated in various gravity theories like gauss - bonnet , lovelock and braneworld scenarios @xcite .",
    "besides examining the validity of the thermodynamical interpretation of gravity by expressing the gravitational field equations into the first law of thermodynamics in different spacetimes , it is also of great interest to investigate the validity of the generalized second law ( gsl ) of thermodynamics in the accelerating universe driven by de .",
    "the gsl of thermodynamics is as important as the first law , governing the development of the nature @xcite .",
    "here our aim is to investigate the validity of the gsl of gravitational thermodynamics for the interacting de model with dm in a non - flat frw universe enclosed by the dynamical apparent horizon and the cosmological event horizon .",
    "note that in the literature , people usually have studied the validity of the gsl for a specific model of de with special kind of interaction term .",
    "but we would like to extend it to any de model with general interaction term .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ ii ] , we study the de model in a non - flat frw universe which is in interaction with the dm . in section [ iii ] , we investigate the validity of the gsl of gravitational thermodynamics for the universe enclosed by the apparent horizon and the event horizon which is in thermal equilibrium with the hawking radiation of the horizon .",
    "also we give an example for the case of the cosmological event horizon . in section [ iv ]",
    "we investigate the effect of interaction term between de and dm on the gsl .",
    "section [ v ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the first friedmann equation in frw cosmology takes the form @xmath0 where we take @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent a flat , closed and open frw universe , respectively .",
    "also @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the energy density of de and dm , respectively .    from ( [ eqfr ] )",
    ", we can write @xmath5 where we have used the following definitions @xmath6 since we consider the interaction between de and dm , @xmath3 and @xmath4 do not conserve separately .",
    "hence the energy conservation equations for de and dm are @xmath7 @xmath8 where q stands for the interaction term . for @xmath9",
    ", there is an energy transfer from the de to dm .",
    "the choice of the interaction between both components was to get a scaling solution to the coincidence problem such that the universe approaches a stationary stage in which the ratio of de and dm becomes a constant @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of interacting de models with different @xmath10-classes have been studied in ample detail by @xcite . here",
    "we continue our study without considering a specific form for the interaction term .    taking the time derivative in both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eqfr ] ) , and using eqs .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) , ( [ eqomega ] ) , ( [ eqpol ] ) and ( [ eqcdm ] ) , one can get the equation of state ( eos ) parameter of de as @xmath11 for the de dominated universe , i.e. @xmath12 , the above equation yields @xmath13 which shows that for the phantom , @xmath14 , and quintessence , @xmath15 , dominated universe , we need to have @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . note that for the de sitter universe , i.e. @xmath18 , we have @xmath19 which behaves like the cosmological constant .    the deceleration parameter is given by @xmath20 replacing the term @xmath21 from ( [ wlambda ] ) into ( [ q1 ] ) yields @xmath22",
    "here , we study the validity of the gsl of gravitational thermodynamics . according to the gsl , entropy of matter and fluids inside the horizon plus the entropy of the horizon do not decrease with time @xcite . here like @xcite , we assume that the temperature of both dark components are equal , due to their mutual interaction . note that lima and alcaniz @xcite using a very naive estimate obtained the present value of the de temperature as @xmath23 .",
    "also zhou et al .",
    "@xcite estimated the dm temperature as @xmath24 for the present time .",
    "since the temperature of the de at the present time differs from that of the dm , the systems must interact for some length of time before they can attain thermal equilibrium .",
    "although in this case the local equilibrium hypothesis may no longer hold @xcite , karami and ghaffari @xcite showed that the contribution of the heat flow between the de and the dm in the gsl in non - equilibrium thermodynamics is very small , @xmath25 . therefore the equilibrium thermodynamics is still preserved .",
    "we also limit ourselves to the assumption that the thermal system including the de and dm bounded by the horizon remain in equilibrium so that the temperature of the system must be uniform and the same as the temperature of its boundary .",
    "this requires that the temperature @xmath26 of the both de and dm inside the horizon should be in equilibrium with the hawking temperature @xmath27 associated with the horizon , so we have @xmath28 .",
    "this expression holds in the local equilibrium hypothesis .",
    "if the temperature of the system differs much from that of the horizon , there will be spontaneous heat flow between the horizon and the fluid and the local equilibrium hypothesis will no longer hold @xcite .",
    "this is also at variance with the frw geometry . in general , when we consider the thermal equilibrium state of the universe , the temperature of the universe is associated with the horizon .",
    "the entropy of the universe including the de and dm inside the horizon can be related to its energy and pressure in the horizon by gibb s equation @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the volume containing the de and dm with the radius of the horizon @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the hawking temperature of the horizon .",
    "also @xmath33 @xmath34 taking the derivative in both sides of ( [ eqslt1 ] ) with respect to cosmic time @xmath35 , and using eqs .",
    "( [ eqfr ] ) , ( [ eq10 ] ) , ( [ eqomega ] ) , ( [ eqpol ] ) , ( [ eqcdm ] ) , ( [ eqede ] ) and ( [ eqecdm ] ) , we obtain the evolution of the entropy in the universe containing the de and dm as @xmath36 also in addition to the entropy in the universe , there is a geometric entropy on the horizon @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of this horizon entropy is obtained as @xmath38 finally , the gsl due to different contributions of the de , dm and horizon is obtained as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the total entropy .",
    "note that in @xmath41 we ignored the contribution of baryonic matter ( bm ) ( @xmath42 ) in comparison with the dm and de ( @xmath43 ) . because according to the recent measurements of the supermassive black hole mass function , the present entropy of bm @xmath44 is five to seven orders of magnitude smaller than the dm @xmath45 @xcite .    in the next sections ,",
    "we investigate the validity of the gsl given by eq .",
    "( [ stot2 ] ) for the dynamical apparent and cosmological event horizons .",
    "the dynamical apparent horizon in the frw universe is given by @xcite @xmath46 for @xmath47 , the apparent horizon is same as the hubble horizon .",

    "@xcite proofed that the apparent horizon of the frw universe with any spatial curvature has indeed an associated hawking temperature @xmath48 .",
    "cai et al .",
    "@xcite also showed that the hawking temperature can be measured by an observer with the kodoma vector inside the apparent horizon .",

    "in our previous analysis , the interaction term between de and dm is not appeared explicitly in the gsl . to see how the de - dm interaction influences the gsl , we need to incorporate a specific form of the de model in our analysis .",
