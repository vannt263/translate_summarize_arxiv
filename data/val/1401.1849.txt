    "introduced in 2006 by japaridze @xcite , cirquent calculus is a refinement of classical sequent calculus .",
    "the advent of cirquent calculus arose from the need for a deductive system with a more explicit ability to reason about resources . unlike the more traditional proof - theoretic approaches that manipulate tree - like objects ( formulas , sequents , etc . ) , cirquent calculus is based on circuit - style structures called _ cirquents _ , in which different `` peer '' ( sibling , cousin , etc . ) substructures may share components .",
    "it is this resource sharing mechanism to which cirquent calculus owes its novelty ( and its virtues ) .",
    "cirquents come in a variety of forms . one way to characterize",
    "the sort of cirquents studied in this paper in familiar terms is to say that a cirquent is a multiset of sequents ( called `` groups '' ) where each formula  more precisely , each occurrence of a formula  may simultaneously belong to more than one sequent .",
    "this explains the origin of the word `` cirquent '' , which is a hybrid of `` circuit '' and `` sequent '' . from its inception ,",
    "cirquent calculus has been paired with an abstract resource semantics .",
    "this semantics allows for reasoning about the interaction between a resource provider and a resource user , where resources are understood in the their most general and intuitive sense .",
    "interpreting resources in a more restricted computational sense has made cirquent calculus instrumental in axiomatizing various fundamental fragments of _ computability logic _ , a formal theory of ( interactive ) computability .",
    "the so - called  classical \" rules of cirquent calculus , in the absence of the particularly troublesome _ contraction _ rule , produce a sound and complete system cl5 for computability logic . born in @xcite , computability logic ( col )",
    "is an ambitious research program aimed at developing a formal theory of interactive computability . to this end ,",
    "formulas of col represent computational problems modeled at games .",
    "the notion of  truth \" for such formulas becomes synonymous with the notion of  computability \" for the computational problems they represent .",
    "while cl5 has shown to be sound and complete with respect japridze s abstract resource semantics , it has also shown to validate a strictly larger class of formulas than affine logic ( sequent calculus without the contraction rule ) , the latter being well studied and sound as a logic of resources . however , due to no shortcomings in effort , a complete resource aware semantics has not been found for affine logic . this had lead japridze to conclude that ",
    "cl5 rather than affine logic adequately materializes the resource philosophy traditionally associated with the latter \" .",
    "indeed , the  semantics before syntax \" philosophy upon which cl5 was conceived , together with its completeness result provide compelling evidence in this direction .    in parallel with the development of cirquent calculus , recent work",
    "@xcite has introduced sound and complete axiomizations for several fragments of col , the most fundamental of these being cl4 , which contains the propositional connectives @xmath1 ( negation ) , @xmath2 ( parallel disjunction ) , @xmath3 ( parallel conjunction ) , @xmath4 ( choice disjunction ) and @xmath5 ( choice conjunction ) as well as the  choice \" quantifiers @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the  blind \" quantifiers @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for a full discussion of these operators and the semantics of col ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "while the semantics of col differs drastically from that of classical logic , the set of valid formulas of cl4 is identical to that of classical logic when restricted to its operators and the so - called  elementary \" sort of atoms .",
    "thus , the presence of the quantifiers @xmath8 and @xmath9 within cl4 s language guarantees its undecidability . in @xcite , however , the @xmath8,@xmath9-free fragment of cl4 was shown to be decidable in polynomial space . a pspace - completeness proof was later given in @xcite .",
    "the deductive apparatus of cl4 is far removed from traditional gentzen or hilbert style axiomizations .",
    "further , the system does not extend very naturally to other fragments of computability logic .",
    "a rectification to this shortcoming came with the advent of cirquent calculus .",
    "as mentioned previously , the fragment of cirquent calculus not containing the _ contraction _ rule , produces a sound and complete system for the fragment of computability logic known as cl5 .",
    "this system contains the operators @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath1 and in this paper we show it to be @xmath0-complete .",
    "we further investigate the complexity of the logical system described by the rules of cl5 , but with the absence of the _ duplication _ rule .",
    "we call this logic cl5@xmath10 and show that every theorem in cl5@xmath10 has a polynomial size proof .",
    "this effectively places the problem of deciding cl5@xmath10 provability in @xmath11 . a reduction from the @xmath12 vertex cover problem to cl5@xmath10 provability",
    "is then given , solidifying the logic as np - complete . in some sense",
    ", cl5 is the col  counterpart \" to multiplicative linear logic , the former being a proper extension of the latter . here , cl5@xmath13 lies strictly between multiplicative affine logic ( linear logic with weakening ) and cl5 . among the virtues of multiplicative affine logic",
    "is that , unlike the conp - complete classical logic , it is in np .",
    "cl5@xmath10 thus presents a nice and natural extension of multiplicative affine logic that gets  closer \" to classical logic while still remaining in np .    with the tight relationship between cirquent calculus and computability logic",
    ", one should not overlook the potential impact of cirquent calculus on other areas of logic and proof theory . in @xcite ,",
    "xu constructs a cirquent calculus based system for the propositional fragment of independence friendly ( if ) logic , allowing one to account for independence from propositional connectives in the same vein that traditional if logic accounts for independence from quantifiers . in @xcite",
    "a cirquent calculus based proof system was developed which , among other benifits , yields polynomial size proofs for all instances of the pigeonhole principle . to date , this is the first proof system to achieve such a result without leveraging cut , extension or substitution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ 2 ] , we provide an introduction to the rules of cirquent calculus and describe the systems cl5 and cl5@xmath10 . section [ 3 ] studies the system cl5@xmath10 and proves its np - completeness . in the final section",
    ", we show the full cl5 to be @xmath0-complete by a reduction from the tqbf-@xmath14 problem .",
    "the present section provides the technical definitions and information necessary for understanding the results of this paper . for a full discussion of the concepts of cirquent calculus ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "as noted previously , a * formula * of the language of cirquent calculus is syntactically identical to that of classical propositional logic , where formulas are built from the connectives @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 as well as non - logical * atoms * ( also known as propositional letters ) . the only difference between the two being that the language of cirquent calculus does not contain logical atoms such as @xmath15 or @xmath16 ; the latter can simply be understood as abbreviations of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , for some ( whatever ) atom @xmath19 .",
