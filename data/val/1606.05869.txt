    "depending on the operating parameters , fractions of @xmath5 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are generated in the hydrogen gas plasma .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 beams are used at fixed velocity heavy ion linacs like unilac to get more beam intensity at a given space charge limit ( @xmath6 ) . at an energy above a few mev",
    "the molecular ion beam can be converted into a proton beam at very high efficiency and with negligible loss in beam quality by passage through a thin carbon stripping foil .",
    "actually , @xmath0 and @xmath1 beams can be produced very efficiently by hot cathode driven volume plasma sources at modest operation parameters @xcite .",
    "applications might be at medical ion beam facilities for cancer treatment .",
    "if @xmath7 and @xmath5 beams are needed , both beams are generated in identical electron cyclotron resonance ecr - sources @xcite .",
    "the sources and injector settings have to be changed due to the @xmath8 difference between @xmath5 and @xmath2 . moreover , this type of ecr source was optimized for heavy ion beams .",
    "this paper explains , why it might be reasonable to add a third source to the injector complex , which can produce @xmath9 efficiently .",
    "the source is cheap , compact , and easy in maintainance .",
    "it allows a factor @xmath10 higher @xmath5 beam current at injector parameters identical to @xmath2 operation down to the stripper foil - due to the space charge limit of a multicell linac .",
    "another application are high current @xmath11 and @xmath12 beam facilities @xcite .",
    "as these beams show a high activation potential it is very important to have a `` start up '' beam for finding operation parameter settings .",
    "this could be done very nicely with intense @xmath13 and @xmath9 beam , respectively .",
    "as shown in fig.[source_cross ] the source consists of a plasma chamber with a hot tungsten filament and a triode extraction system .",
    "the cathode emits electrons which are accelerated to the cylindrical plasma chamber wall .",
    "electrons are forced into cycloidal paths by an external solenoidal field , increasing their path lengths to the wall , and thereby , increasing the probability of an ionizing collision with neutrals .",
    "fig.[source_mag ] shows the block diagram of the source with power supplies and the on axis magnetic field produced by the solenoid .",
    "one can see , that almost a @xmath14 magnetic field level is present at the extraction system .",
    "magnetic field levels at the plasma chamber centre up to @xmath15 were applied by coil currents up to @xmath16 .",
    "the heating filament as well produces a comparable magnetic field of around @xmath17 by heating current upto @xmath18 .",
    "this magnetic force does not have a significant effect on the ion beam , but does change the plasma properties significantly .",
    "a triode extraction system was used . at normal settings the plasma electrode",
    "is held at positive potential , the screening electrode is held at a negative @xmath19 level of the plasma electrode potential . the space charge dominated beam current is given by the child langmuir law , @xmath20 @xmath21 is the current density , @xmath22 is the accelerating potential and @xmath11 is the acceleration gap length . in the source",
    "used @xmath11 was @xmath23 .",
    "fig.[setup ] shows the experimental setup used for a characterization of the ion source .",
    "the source was mounted on a differential pumping chamber equipped with three turbo molecular pumps .",
    "a faraday cup was installed in the same tank for beam current measurements .",
    "an emittance scanner of the grid slit type was mounted and a momentum analyzer was installed downstream .",
    "the helium beam consists of a single specie , singly charged ion beam for this source type , generated by the reaction @xmath25",
    "fig.[he_example ] shows an example of a @xmath24 beam with current @xmath26 extracted at @xmath27 beam energy .",
    "a gas filling pressure of @xmath28 and @xmath29 arc potential were used as standard settings .",
    "the terminal can supply voltage levels up to @xmath30 .",
    "the current extracted was measured by a faraday cup .",
    "the proton beam is extracted from a plasma fed by @xmath33 .",
    "the key reactions involved are , @xmath34 the last two processes are assumed to be important for an efficient production of protons in a small source@xcite@xcite@xcite . it was figured out that the proton fraction depends upon plasma parameters .",
    "the whole parameter space of arc current and magnetic field was scanned at three different values of arc potential ( @xmath35 ) and three different values of source filling pressure ( @xmath36 ) to find the maximum fraction of individual species . to get a clear contrast in the plots for identifying the optimum settings for the production of the species of interest , for example for protons , the _ relative occurrence _",
    "( @xmath37 ) was defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the relative percentage at that perticular set of parameters . in a similar way ,",
    "the @xmath37 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 were defined .",
    "fig.[rel_occ_max ] shows the relative occurrence of @xmath42 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 as function of arc current ( @xmath43 ) and magnetic field at the gas filling pressure of @xmath44 and @xmath45 arc potential . at particular values of magnetic field and plasma density",
    "the relative occurrence of particular species is very high .",
    "thus the graph shows an _ island _ kind structure .",
    "fig.[mass_spectra_max ] shows the mass spectra at the optimum values of relative occurrences . as optimum ratios at each of the separate _ island",
    "_ positions , about @xmath46 of proton corresponding to @xmath47 , about @xmath48 of @xmath40 corresponding to @xmath49 and about @xmath50 of @xmath41 corresponding to @xmath3 current were extracted at @xmath4 beam energy respectively .    when these graphs were plotted for different filling pressure or arc potential the island positions moved ( see fig.[rel_occ_vary_p ] and [ rel_occ_vary_ubogen ] ) and the intensity decreased while retaining the island structure .",
    "typically , the used version of heating cathode should be changed after around @xmath51 of operation .",
    "a proton beam containing @xmath52 of @xmath42 was extracted routinely for the beam transport experiments at frankfurt university .",
    "especially , this ion source provides @xmath0 and @xmath1 beams with individual ratios up to @xmath50 .",
    "the source can be tuned in a wide range of operating parameters to optimize the beam .",
