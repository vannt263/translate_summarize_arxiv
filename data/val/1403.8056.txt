    "the mesh points uniformly span a cubic box and some boundary conditions such as periodic ones are imposed in each dimension .",

    "it was shown that such operators can be expanded in a basis of derivative operators and the corresponding operator coefficients are sensitive indicators for rotational symmetry breaking .",
    "this method has been applied perturbatively both at tree - level and the one - loop level .",
    "the simple answer to reducing systematic errors on the lattice is to extrapolate to the limit where the lattice spacing goes to zero and the physical volume goes to infinity .",
