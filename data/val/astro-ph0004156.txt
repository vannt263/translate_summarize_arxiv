    "recent astrophysical and cosmological observations such as the luminosity distance - redshift relation for the supernovae type  ia  @xcite , the recent observations of the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies  @xcite , gravitional lensing  @xcite and velocity fields  @xcite tend to indicate that a large fraction of the matter of the universe today is composed of matter with negative pressure ( see e.g.  @xcite for a comparison of the different observations ) .",
    "recent analyses  @xcite seem to indicate that the energy density @xmath2 and the pressure @xmath3 of this fluid satisfies @xmath4 which is compatible with a cosmological constant @xmath5 for which @xmath6 ( see also  @xcite for arguments in favour of @xmath7 ) .",
    "a typical value of @xmath8 for its energy density in units of the critical density of the universe corresponds to an energy scale of order @xmath9 which is very far from what is expected from high energy physics ; this is the well known cosmological constant problem  @xcite . to circumvent this problem different solutions",
    "have been proposed starting from the idea of a dynamical cosmological constant  @xcite to lead to the class of models known as _ quintessence _  @xcite , where a spatially homogeneous scalar field @xmath10 is rolling down a potential decreasing when @xmath10 tends to infinity .",
    "an example of such a potential which has been widely studied is the inverse power law potential",
    ". it can be obtained from some high energy physics models , e.g. where supersymmetry is broken through fermion condensates  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been argued  @xcite that supergravity has to be taken into account since today one expects the scalar field to be of order of the planck mass @xmath11 and corrections to the potential appear at this energy .",
    "this leads to a better agreement with observations  @xcite .",
    "an important point about this family of models is the existence of scaling solutions  @xcite ( refered to as _ tracking solutions _ ) , i.e. such that @xmath10 evolves as the scale factor of the universe at a given power .",
    "these solutions are attractors of the dynamical system describing the evolution of the scale factor and of the scalar field .",
    "this implies that the present time behaviour of the field is almost independent of its initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "this property allows to address  @xcite ( i ) the _ coincidence problem _ ,",
    "i.e. the fact that @xmath10 starts to dominate today and ( ii ) the _ fine tuning problem _ , i.e. the fact that one does not have to fine tune the initial condition of the field @xmath10",
    ".    one of us extended these models to include a non - minimal coupling @xmath12 between the scalar field and the scalar curvature @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "such a coupling term appears e.g.  when quantising fields in curved spacetime  @xcite and in multi - dimensional theories  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that when @xmath14 tracking solutions still exist  @xcite and this result was generalised  @xcite to any coupling function @xmath15 and potential @xmath16 satisfying @xmath17 .",
    "however , such a coupling is constrained by the variations of the constants of nature  @xcite which fix bounds on @xmath18  @xcite . a way to circumvent",
    "this problem is to consider quintessence models in the framework of scalar - tensor theories  @xcite where a double attractor mechanism can occur , i.e. of the scalar - tensor theory towards general relativity and of the scalar field @xmath10 towards its tracking solution .    among all the possible observations of cosmology , gravitational waves give an insight on epochs where there was a variation of the background dynamics since every such variation affects the shape of the stochastic graviton background spectrum  @xcite .",
    "we can then view our universe as containing a sea of stochastic gravitational waves from primordial origin , as predicted by most models of structure formations such as inflation  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a review ) and topological defects scenarios  @xcite .",
    "their spectrum extends typically from @xmath19  hz ( for wavelengths of order of the size of the hubble radius today ) to @xmath20  hz ( the smallest mode that has been inflated out of the hubble radius ) and they could be detected or constrained by coming experiments such as ligo  @xcite , virgo  @xcite ( at @xmath21  hz ) and lisa  @xcite ( at @xmath22  hz ) .",
    "gravitational waves , which are perturbations in the metric of the universe have also an effect on the cosmic microwave ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy  @xcite and polarisation  @xcite allowing to extract information on their amplitude from the measure of the cmb anisotropies .",
    "for instance , bounds on the energy density spectrum of these cosmological gravitational waves in units of the critical density , @xmath1 , have been obtained from the cmb  @xcite @xmath23    gravitational waves are also a very good probe of the conditions in the early universe since they decouple early in its history and can help e.g. testing the initial conditions of @xmath10 .",
    "an example was put forward by giovannini  @xcite who showed that in a class of quintessential inflation models  @xcite there was an era dominated by the scalar field @xmath10 before the radiation dominated era which implies that a large part of the gravitational wave energy of order @xmath24 ( about eight orders of magnitude higher than for standard inflation ) was in the ghz region .",
    "this may happen in any scenario where the inflation ends with a kinetic phase  @xcite or when the dominant energy condition is violated @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the cmb temperature fluctuations give information on the history of the gravitational waves in between the last scattering surface and today through the integrated sachs - wolfe effect , whereas the polarisation of the cmb radiation gives mainly information on the gravitational waves at decoupling .",
    "these three observables ( energy spectrum , cmb temperature and polarisation anisotropies ) are thus complementary and we aim to present here a global study of the cosmological properties of the gravitational waves .",
    "the goals of this article are ( i ) to study in more details the cosmology with a non - minimal quintessence field and ( ii ) to study gravitational waves in this class of models . in  [ par2 ]",
    "we set up the general framework and describe the two potentials we shall consider . in  [ par3 ] we introduce and define the observable quantities associated with the gravitational waves : their energy density spectrum and their imprint on the cmb radiation anisotropies and its polarisation . in  [ sec_damping ] , we point out the general mechanism of damping by the anisotropic stress of the radiation . in  [ par4 ] we discuss the parameters of the problem and investigate the tuning of the potential parameters ; we also describe the evolution of the background spacetime and show that a non - minimally coupled quintessence field is a candidate for a ( @xmath25)-matter . in  [ par5 ] we describe the main properties of the gravitational waves .",
    "we finish in  [ par6 ] by presenting numerical results and we underline the complementarity of the different observational quantities .",
    "this work gives a detailed study of the observational effects of gravitational waves in the framework of quintessence , including some recent developments , and allowing for non - minimal coupling .",
    "this extends the work on quintessential inflation  @xcite by including the effects on the cmb .",
    "it also extends the studies on @xmath5cdm  @xcite to quintessence and is , as far as we know , a more complete study of the effect of gravitational waves on the cmb polarisation .",
    "we hope to show that a joint study of the gravitational wave detection experiments  @xcite of the cmb experiments  @xcite and of the polarisation experiments  @xcite can lead to a better determination of their properties .",
    "we consider a universe described by a friedmann - lematre model with euclidean spatial sections so that the metric takes the form @xmath26\\equiv       \\bar g_{\\mu\\nu}{{\\rm d}}x^\\mu { { \\rm d}}x^\\nu,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the scale factor and @xmath28 the conformal time .",
    "greek indices run from 0 to 3 and latin indices from 1 to 3 .",
    "we assume that the matter content of the universe can be described by a mixure of matter and radiation ( mainly baryons , cdm , photons and three families of massless , non - degenerate neutrinos ) and a scalar field @xmath10 non - minimally coupled to gravity evolving in a potential @xmath29 that will be described later .",
    "the action for this system is @xmath30,\\ ] ] with @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the newton constant , and where @xmath33 is the lagrangian of the ordinary matter which is uncoupled to the scalar field and @xmath34 is an arbitrary function of the scalar field that will be specified later .",
    "the action  ( [ action ] ) can be rewritten under the interesting form @xmath35 }    -\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_\\mu\\phi\\partial^\\mu\\phi - v(\\phi)+     { \\cal l}_{\\rm matter}\\right],\\ ] ] with @xmath36 \\equiv \\frac{\\kappa}{1 - 2\\xi\\kappa f(\\phi)}.\\ ] ] the stress - energy tensor of the scalar field is obtained by varying its lagrangian [ @xmath37 to get @xmath38\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the einstein tensor of the metric @xmath40 , @xmath41 its covariant derivative and @xmath42 .",
    "the equations governing the evolution of the background spacetime are then obtained by varying  ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath40 , @xmath10 and the ordinary matter fields to get respectively the friedmann equations , the klein - gordon equation and the fluid conservation equation @xmath43 a dot denotes a derivative with respect to the conformal time and @xmath44 is the comoving hubble parameter . the matter fluid energy density @xmath2 and pressure @xmath3 are assumed to satisfy the equation of state @xmath45 .",
    "the factor @xmath46 varies from @xmath47 deep in the radiation era to @xmath48 in the matter era . the scalar field energy density @xmath49 and pressure @xmath50 are obtained from its stress - energy tensor ( [ tphi ] ) and are then explicitely given by @xmath51 , \\\\ p_\\phi   & = &    \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\dot\\phi^{2}}{a^2 } - v(\\phi )         - \\frac{2\\xi}{a^2}\\left [   ( 2\\dot{{\\cal h}}+3{{\\cal h}}^2)f(\\phi )                                 + { { \\cal h}}\\dot f(\\phi)+\\ddot f(\\phi)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we stress that the conservation equation derived from  ( [ tphi ] ) reduces to the klein - gordon equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) . for each matter component , @xmath52 say , we introduce the density parameter @xmath53 defined as @xmath54    to completely specify the model , we have to fix the potential @xmath29 .",
    "following our previous work  @xcite and as discussed in the introduction we choose it to behave as @xmath55 where @xmath5 is an energy scale . as shown in  @xcite , such a potential leads to the existence of tracking solutions whatever the value of @xmath18 and for which the scalar field behaves as a barotropic fluid of equation of state ( as long as the background fluid dominates ) @xmath56 we also consider another class of potentials arising when one takes supergravity into account  @xcite and given by @xmath57 the effect of the exponential term is important only at late time so that the scaling properties of the tracking solution are not affected during the matter and radiation era .",
    "however when the field starts to dominate it leads to its stabilisation  @xcite which has an effect on the effective equation of state of the scalar fluid .      in this article , we want to focus on the properties of the gravitational waves which are tensorial perturbations . at linear order ,",
    "the metric is expanded as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a transverse traceless ( tt ) perturbation , i.e. satisfying @xmath60 it is also useful to define the perturbation @xmath61 by @xmath62 which , from  ( [ tt1 ] ) , satisfies @xmath63    the equation of evolution of @xmath64 is obtained by considering the tt part of the perturbed einstein equation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) which leads to @xmath65 \\dot h_{kl}-\\delta h_{kl}=2\\kappa pa^2\\bar\\pi_{kl}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the laplacian and where the anisotropic stress tensor of the matter , @xmath67 , is defined as the tensor component of the matter stress - energy tensor @xmath68 the anisotropic stress of the matter fluid is dominated by the contribution of the neutrinos and of the photons and its form can be obtained by describing these relativistic fluids by a boltzmann equation  @xcite ( see  [ par3_2 ] below ) .",
    "the goal of this section is to define the observable quantities related to the gravitational waves .",
    "we start by reviewing the computation of the energy density @xmath69 of a stochastic background of gravitational waves and finish by describing their effect on the cmb radiation , namely we present the computation of the coefficients @xmath70 of the development of the angular correlation function of the cmb temperature anisotropy and polarisation .      the definition of the gravitational waves stress - energy tensor @xmath71 can be found in e.g.  @xcite in the case of a minkowski background spacetime , in e.g.  @xcite in the case of a friedmann - lematre spacetime and a general discussion can be found in e.g.  @xcite .    to define the gravitational waves stress - energy tensor",
    ", we have to expand the einstein - hilbert action  ( [ action2 ] ) to second order in the perturbation @xmath59 , which implies to develop the curvature scalar @xmath72 at second order in the perturbations ( see  @xcite ) to get ( up to divergence terms and forgetting the contribution arising from @xmath33 ) @xmath73}\\bar\\nabla_\\mu f_{\\alpha\\beta } \\bar\\nabla^\\mu f^{\\alpha\\beta}\\sqrt{-\\bar g}{{\\rm d}}^4x.\\ ] ] this expression is valid whatever the background metric as long as @xmath59 is a transverse traceless perturbation .",
    "note that contrarily to the `` standard '' situation , @xmath74 now depends on @xmath10 because of the non - minimal coupling with the scalar field .",

    "now , since @xmath96 oscillates , we define the energy density of the gravitational waves by taking the average of  ( [ too ] ) over @xmath97 periods .",

    "the ergodic hypothesis is well justified .",
    "in fact , because of the averaging procedure of the transfer function , we have to restrict to modes such that @xmath102 if we want to average on about ten periods .",
    "again , we emphasize that there is an explicit dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath69 on the scalar field @xmath10 because of the non - minimal coupling and our expressions reduce to the standard ones  @xcite when @xmath103 . we have described the gravitational waves by two stochastic variables @xmath104 which can be understood as being the classical limit of a complete quantum description of the gravitational waves ( see e.g.  @xcite for details ) .    before turning to the effects of the gravitational waves on the cmb ,",
    "let us make a comment that will lead us to introduce some new notations .",
    "in the previous analysis we decomposed the metric perturbation @xmath105 on the basis @xmath106 of tt eigenfunctions of the laplacian , i.e. such that @xmath107 such a decomposition is indeed not unique and we could have chosen any other such basis . in the cmb literature ,",
    "one often prefers  @xcite to use the basis @xmath108 defined by @xmath109 the vectors @xmath110 and @xmath111 being defined above  ( [ defepsilon ] ) .",
    "if we decompose @xmath105 on the latter basis as @xmath112 then the two decompositions are related by @xmath113 \\quad,\\quad \\hat h^{(+)}=-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}i\\left[h^{(+2)}-h^{(-2)}\\right].\\ ] ] the two polarisations @xmath114 are then solution of  ( [ eqh ] ) which reads @xmath115\\dot h^{(m)}+k^2h^{(m)}=\\kappa p a^2\\pi^{(m)}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 is the coefficient of the development of @xmath117 as in  ( [ develop2 ] ) so that the transfer functions for @xmath118 and @xmath104 are the same .",
    "if we now define the power spectrum of @xmath119 as @xmath120 one can easily check that @xmath121 and that if the two polarisations @xmath122 and @xmath123 are independent then @xmath124 and @xmath125 are also independent . with these notations , the energy density spectra are given as @xmath126 indeed , this does not change the result but we found interesting to make the link between the notations used in the gravitational waves literature  @xcite and in the cmb literature  @xcite , specially because we want to present both in a unified framework and language . from now on , we use the second decomposition and its interest will be enlightened by the study of the cmb anisotropies .      gravitational waves , being metric perturbations , have an effect on the temperature and polarisation of the cmb photons .",
    "any metric perturbation induces a fluctuation on the cmb temperature @xmath127 through the sachs - wolfe effect  @xcite and any anisotropic distribution of photons scattered by electrons will become polarised and vice - versa . since thomson scattering generates linear polarisation , we only need to consider the stokes parameters @xmath128 and @xmath129 and more conveniently their two combinations @xmath130 which are invariant under rotation .",
    "following hu and white  @xcite , we decompose the tensorial part of the temperature anisotropies according to @xmath131 the coefficients @xmath132 and @xmath133 transform as @xmath134 and @xmath135 under parity and are called the `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' part of the polarisation .",
    "the functions @xmath136 , @xmath137 form three independent sets of orthonormal functions and depend both on the position @xmath138 and on the direction of propagation of the photons @xmath139 and are defined as @xmath140 where the functions @xmath141 are the standard spherical harmonics and the functions @xmath142 are the spin - weighted spherical harmonics  @xcite .",
    "note that the decomposition on the basis @xmath143 in the previous section is enlightened by the fact that @xmath144  @xcite .",
    "the angular correlation function of these temperature / polarisation anisotropies are observed on a 2-sphere around us and can be decomposed in legendre polynomials @xmath145 as @xmath146 where @xmath129 , @xmath16 stand for @xmath127 , @xmath147 , or @xmath148 .",

    "we now turn to the more unusual case where the scalar field dominates at the end of inflation and where the universe undergoes a kinetic phase before the radiation era  @xcite as in e.g. quintessential inflation  @xcite .",
    "the wavelengths corresponding to the observable cmb multipoles ( @xmath284 ) are much larger than the hubble radius at nucleosynthesis , epoch at which we have to be radiation dominated . as a consequence",
    ", we expect no signature from this early phase on the cmb anisotropies and polarisation .",
    "as first pointed out in  @xcite , if the scalar field dominates at early stage , there is an excess of gravitational waves at high frequency [ see equation  ( [ 84 ] ) ] . on fig .",
    "[ plot9 ] , we present such a spectrum and we will discuss the implication of this excess later .",
    "an interesting effect concerns the difference between the spectra obtained from an inverse power law potential and a sugra - like potential . as shown on fig .",
    "[ plot9 ]  [ right ] , the amplitude of the spectrum at high frequency in roughly 30% higher for inverse power law potentials .",
    "the relative decrease in amplitude at these frequencies for sugra - like potentials depends on the dynamics of the scalar field in the bounce ( see figs .",
    "[ plot2 ] and  [ plot3 ] ) during which the equation of state varies from @xmath285 to @xmath239 and to @xmath285 again .",
    "thus , during this time , the modes that had just entered into the hubble radius ( and thus which had just started to undergo damped oscillations ) went out of it ( during the @xmath286 epoch ) and their amplitude was frozen before re - entering the hubble radius again .",
    "hence , the modes of larger wavelengths are less damped which explains this decrease in amplitude .",
    "now , if the slope of the potential is less steep , the bounce lasts longer ( note that we always reach @xmath287 at the point where @xmath288 ) and thus the damping is stronger .",
    "this signature , even if not detectable by coming experiment is nevertheless a clear feature of supergravity .",
    "to finish , let us discuss the total energy density of gravitational waves @xmath289 today . as pointed out in  @xcite ,",
    "it has also to be negligible at nucleosynthesis ; this constraint is more drastic than the only requirement that @xmath198 be negligible at that time .",
    "let us emphasize that the constraint on @xmath198 can not be avoided ( since it involves background dynamics ) whereas the one on @xmath289 depends on @xmath217 and @xmath218 and thus leads to a combined constraint on the initial conditions of the scalar field and on the initial power spectrum of the gravitational waves .",
    "besides @xmath217 and @xmath218 , @xmath289 mainly depends on the initial values of @xmath49 and @xmath290 which can be parametrised by the reheating temperature @xmath291 ( related roughly to @xmath290 at that time ) and the redshift @xmath292 of equality between the kinetic scalar field era and the radiation era ( related roughly to @xmath293 at the end of reheating ) .",
    "@xmath289 can be estimated by the surface of the spectrum below the part with a positive slope ( i.e. the high frequency part ; see fig .",
    "[ plot9 ] ) and thus of order @xmath294 where @xmath295 and @xmath296 are respectively the modes entering the hubble radius at the reheating and at @xmath292 .",
    "thus the `` bump '' at short wavelength can not be too high .",
    "moreover , the energy density at the end of reheating can not be higher that planck scale , so that it fixes a limit on the shortest mode in which gravitational waves are produced . on fig .",
    "[ reheating ] , we first plot [ left ] the variation of the gravitational wave spectrum with the parameters @xmath297 and we then give [ right ] the `` safe '' zone of parameters for nucleosynthesis [ for @xmath298 and defined  @xcite by @xmath299 .",
    "let us briefly explain how this bounds are obtained .    1",

    "[ reheating ] .",
    "note that since we are in a field dominated era @xmath305 and thus on this `` planck limit '' we have @xmath306 and @xmath307 ( and thus @xmath308 and @xmath309 ) from wich we conclude that the maximum of the power spectrum is roughly located on a curve @xmath310 [ see fig .",
    "[ reheating ] ] .",
    "4 .   to finish",
    ", we want that the gravitational waves energy density does not alter nucleosynthesis , i.e. that @xmath311 where @xmath312 is a third numerical coefficient .",
    "this corresponds to the dot - dash line on fig .",
    "[ reheating ] .",
    "for all the points @xmath297 above the dotted and dot - dashed lines of fig .",
    "[ reheating ] [ right ] , there is no excess of gravitational waves .",
    "the solid line separates the two sets of initial conditions zwe have considered .",
    "we must emphasize that this result was obtained for @xmath313 and that the spectrum can be tilted , which modifies the bounds on the parameter set @xmath297 ( more precisely , taking smaller @xmath217 or negative @xmath218 lowers the diagonal dot - dashed line ) .",
    "such constraints may be important for instance while considering models where a scalar field dominates at baryogenesis  @xcite .    in the case of a `` blue '' initial power spectrum ( i.e. with @xmath314 in our notations , or @xmath315 in the notations of  @xcite ) , as advocated for example in  @xcite , the flat branch of fig .",
    "[ plot9 ] ( corresponding to the `` semi - hard '' branch of  @xcite ) is already tilted , giving as stronger constraint on our model .",

    "i.e. the fact that @xmath320 implies a tuning of @xmath5 ( roughly the precision on @xmath5 has to one order of magnitude higher than the one on @xmath198 ) which is however less severe than the fine tuning needed for a cosmological constant .",
    "this being fixed , the tracking mechanism allows to span a very wide range of initial conditions for the scalar field and there is no fine tuning in that respect .",
    "we then showed that the combined study of the gravitational waves energy spectrum and of their imprint on the cmb radiation temperature and polarisation enables to extract many complementary informations on the models :      as pointed out in  @xcite , there is an excess of gravitational waves today if inflation ends by a kinetic phase . in that case",
    ", one has to check that both @xmath321 and @xmath322 are negligible at the time of nucleosynthesis and we relate the amount of gravitational waves today to the reheating temperature and the time of equality between the kinetic scalar era and the radiation era .",

    "it was also shown that the amplitude of the gravitational waves spectrum for inverse power law potentials is @xmath323% higher than for sugra - like potentials at high frequency .",
