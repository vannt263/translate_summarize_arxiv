    "entanglement , as measured by , _",
    "e.g. _ , bipartite block entanglement entropy , is playing an increasingly important role in the study of condensed - matter or quantum many - body physics , both conceptually and quantitatively .",
    "it has been used as a very useful and in some cases indispensable way to characterize phases and phase transitions , especially for phases and quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated fermionic or spin systems ( for a review , see ref . [ ] ) . for bosonic systems , studies of entanglement entropy",
    "have mostly focused on _ relativistic _ free bosonic field theories @xcite , which are equivalent to coupled harmonic oscillator systems ( for reviews , see refs . [ ] and [ ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the entanglement properties of free _ non - relativistic _ bose gases .",
    "in addition to interest in its own right , our motivation also comes in part from the following consideration . in recent studies",
    "it has been shown that entanglement is enhanced at quantum critical points @xcite and strongly correlated phases with topological order @xcite , in the form of either violation of area law @xcite , or subleading corrections to the area law that diverges with block size @xcite ( usually in a logarithmic fashion ) .",
    "on the other hand there have been relatively few studies of the behavior of entanglement entropy in states with traditional long - range order @xcite . in a recent work @xcite , we calculated the block entanglement entropy of some exactly soluble spin models that exhibit ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic long - range order in the ground state , and found that such conventional orders also lead to logarithmically divergent contribution to the entropy .",
    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) is perhaps the simplest example of conventional ordering .",
    "it is thus natural to study its entanglement properties .",
    "as we are going to show , a bose - einstein condensate ( referred to as a condensate from now on ) indeed makes a logarithmically divergent contribution to the entropy as well .",
    "besides the entanglement entropy of the ground state , the entanglement properties of system at finite temperature are also of great interest .",
    "however , the entanglement entropy is only well - defined for a pure state . for a system that is described by a mixed density matrix",
    ", the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix becomes different for the two parts of the bipartite systems .",
    "in such cases , there is a natural extension of the entanglement entropy that one can work with - the mutual information @xcite .",
    "we will show that a condensate , when present , makes a logarithmically divergent contribution to the mutual information .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we study the ground state entanglement entropy of a generic free boson model that is translationally invariant @xcite . in sec",
    "iii we introduce an infinite - range hopping model for bosons which is exactly solvable , and calculate the mutual information analytically . in sec .",
    "iv we introduce a long - range hopping model for bosons in one - dimension ( 1d ) which exhibits a finite temperature bec for a certain parameter range , then we present a numerical study of the mutual information for this model . in the end , we summarize and discuss the results of this paper in sec . v.",
    "consider a general hamiltonian of free bosons hopping on a lattice of size @xmath0 : [ eq : generalh ] h = - _ ij t_ij ^_i _ j , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 s are the bosonic annihilation ( creation ) operators .",
    "if the system is translationally invariant , @xmath3 , then the hamiltonian can be diagonalized by fourier transformation : h = _ k ( k ) ^_k _ k , where @xmath4 is the annihilation operator in @xmath5 space . in most generic cases , the ground state is the @xmath6 state . at zero temperature ,",
    "all particles fall into the ground state . for a system containing @xmath7 particles ,",
    "the ground state is given by : = ( ^_0)^n = ( _ j ^_j)^n .    to consider its bipartite block entanglement entropy , we divide the system of size @xmath0 in two parts , and label them @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively . let the sizes of each part be @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and define ^_a = _ j a ^_j ,  ^_b = _ j b ^_j . then we can write @xmath13 as :    & = ( _ a + _ b ) ^n = _ l=0^n ( ^_a)^l ( ^_b)^n - l + & = l^-n/2 _ l l_a^l/2 l_b^(n - l)/2 + & = _ l _ a _ b ,    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "this is an explicit schmidt decomposition , and therefore the entanglement entropy is readily given by :    e = - _ l _ l _",
    "l.    we are interested in the asymptotic behavior in two limiting cases : ( 1 ) the equal partition case ; ( 2 ) size of @xmath9 is substantially larger than @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath18 .",

    "can be approximated by an integral .",
    "also in this limit , the gaussian factor is sharply peaked around @xmath28 , the integral region can be extended to from minus infinity to infinity .",
    "using the fact that @xmath29 , we arrive at ( x ) e^- .",
    "the entanglement entropy is then [ eqn : eeep ] e - ^_-(x)(x ) dx = ( 1 + ( ) ) = n + ( 1 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) unequal partition , @xmath18 :    if @xmath18 , @xmath30 , but keep @xmath31 ( fixed ) , the distribution of @xmath22 approaches a poisson distribution : _",
    "the entropy of the poisson distribution , which in this case is our entanglement entropy , is known to be : [ eq : ee ]    e & = [ 1 + ( 2l_a ) ] - + o ( ) + & = - + o ( ) = n_a + ( 1 ) ,    where @xmath32 is the average particle number in subsystem @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , we find , in both cases , that the leading term of the mutual information goes as @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "in this section , we will study the natural generalization of entanglement entropy at finite temperature : the mutual information , which is defined as e_m = ( e_a + e_b - s ) , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrices of subsystems a and b , respectively , and @xmath37 is the entropy of the whole system . note that at finite temperature @xmath35 and @xmath36 are no longer the same due to the fact that the system is described by a mixed density matrix .",
    "we must emphasize here that our definition of mutual information differs from its usual definition @xcite by a factor of 2 so that it will converge to the entanglement entropy when the system approaches a pure state .      in order to facilitate an exact solution",
    ", we consider the following infinite - range hopping model which is obtained by setting @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : generalh ] ) to a constant properly scaled by the system size @xmath39 so that the thermodynamic limit is well - defined .",

    "i^ ) ( _ j _ j ) . by substituting the fourier transform of @xmath40 s defined in sec .",
    "ii , @xmath4 , one obtains : h = -t ^_0 _ 0 .",
    "this model has a very simple spectrum with a ground state with energy @xmath41 , and all the other excited states are degenerate with zero energy .",
    "this particularly simplified spectrum makes an exact solution possible .    to study the finite temperature properties of this model",
    ", we will work with the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) , in which the chemical potential @xmath42 is introduced to control the average density of the system .",
    "this model exhibits bec at finite temperature @xmath43 . to determine @xmath43 , we start by considering a system of finite size @xmath0 , and its occupation numbers are : = = , = . here",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 denote average occupation numbers for the corresponding states in @xmath5-space ; @xmath46 is the inverse temperature . from this point on ,",
    "when we write @xmath47 , it immediately indicates @xmath48 .",
    "the average total particle number of the system will be denoted as @xmath49 . to identify @xmath43 , we know in the thermodynamic limit , when @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",

    "so we obtain : t_c = .",
    "[ eq : inf_tc ]    above @xmath43 , @xmath55 , from which in the large @xmath0 limit we can derive that = -t ( 1 + ) .",
    "@xmath42 has a finite size correction which is negligible above @xmath43 , but will become important below @xmath43 .",
    "we also know that the partition function of the system in gce .",
    "bears the following form : z = ( ) ^l-1 , from which it is easy to show that the entropy in gce .",
    "takes the following form : [ eq : thermal entropy ]    s & = - = z - z + & = ( 1 + ) ( 1 + ) - n_0 + ( l - 1 ) .    anticipating later relevance , we are particularly interested in the behavior of finite size systems near @xmath43 . for a finite system ,",
    "the chemical potential @xmath42 is no longer strictly equal the ground state energy below @xmath43 , but picks up a finite size correction @xmath56 determined by the following condition : = , from which we can easily derive that = - t ( 1 + ) .",
    "consider @xmath57 , and make use of the following fact = - _ k 0 = - , we obtain = - = - .",
    "this equation can be solved to give @xmath58 as a function of system size @xmath0 at a given density @xmath59 , at @xmath60 : [ eq : n_0@tc ] = .",
    "even though this divergent @xmath61 does not affect the thermodynamic behavior of the system , as we will see later it makes a ( leading ) divergent contribution to the mutual information at @xmath60 depending on how the system is partitioned , or specifically how large is the subsystem size @xmath10 compared with this @xmath62 divergence .      in the following part , we will use peschel s result @xcite on the reduced density matrix of a gaussian state : [ eq : rdm ] _ a = e^\\{((1+g)g^-1)}^t_ij^_i _ j , where @xmath63 is the two point correlation function matrix truncated within the subsystem , and @xmath64 is the normalization factor .",

    "its eigenvalues are all zero except for one : @xmath68 , which gives us a non - zero entropy @xmath69 at @xmath70 .",
    "this reflects the fact that we are working with gce where the particle - number fluctuation is still permissible at @xmath70 and the fluctuation amplitude @xmath71 .",
    "however , as we show below , the mutual information still converges to the correct zero temperature limit , the entanglement entropy , at least to the leading order .",
    "the von neumann entropy for a subsystem @xmath8 is given by e_a^ ( ) = ( n_a + 1 ) ( n_a + 1 ) - n_a n_a = n_a + n_a ( 1 + ) , where @xmath72 is the average total particle number in the subsystem @xmath8 .",
    "in the large @xmath7 limit , the second term converges to @xmath73 .",

    "all particles fall into the ground state , and we find the entanglement entropy diverges as the logarithm of the particle number in the subsystem . at finite temperatures , we studied the natural generalization of entanglement entropy - the mutual information .",
    "we find the mutual information has a similar divergence in the presence of a bose - einstein condensate . when the system is above @xmath43 or does not have a condensate , the mutual information saturates for large subsystem size .",
    "it should be noted that for the special models we studied in this paper there is no area - law contribution to the mutual information , thus the contribution from the condensate , when present , dominates the mutual information . in more generic models in two- or three - dimensions where an area - law contribution is present ,",
    "we expect such logarithmic divergent contribution from the condensate to be present as a sub - leading term in the subsystem - size dependence of the entanglement entropy and mutual information .",
    "physically it is easy to understand why the condensate makes such an important contribution to entanglement .",
    "first of all , bec is intrinsically a quantum process , just like entanglement reflects the intrinsically quantum nature of the system .",
    "more specifically , when a ( macroscopically ) large number of particles occupy the same state ( at @xmath6 ) , they are necessarily delocalized throughout the sample , giving rise to entanglement between blocks .    just like in our previous work on a very different system @xcite",
    ", our results here suggest that _ conventional _ ordering , like bec , makes a logarithmic contribution to entanglement .",
