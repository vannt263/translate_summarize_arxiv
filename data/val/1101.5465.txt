    "chaos in classical mechanics occurs as a result of loss of correlation between neighbouring initial conditions , leading to a very complex trajectory in phase space @xcite .",
    "the faster this correlation is lost , more chaotic the system is and this is quantified by the lyapunov exponent . however , in quantum mechanics , uncertainty principle does not allow a description in terms of trajectories which makes the notion of chaos in quantum systems to lose its meaning in the sense as it is used in classical mechanics .",
    "moreover , unlike chaotic classical systems where one can not obtain analytic expressions for classical trajectories , one can write ( albeit rarely ) such expressions for eigenfunctions @xcite of some quantum systems which are classically chaotic . in this paper",
    ", we study the kolmogorov stochasticity parameter for level sequences and several related aspects in attempt to capture order - chaos transition in quantum mechanics .",
    "we consider billiards which are dynamical systems consisting of a freely moving particle in an enclosure , reflecting specularly from the boundary in accordance with snell law .",
    "these systems possess a wide range of dynamical behaviour depending upon the shape of the enclosure .",
    "for instance , circular billiard enjoys two functionally independent constants of the motion , viz .",
    "angular momentum and energy , phase space trajectory resides on the surface of a two - dimensional torus .",
    "such systems exhibit regular behaviour and are termed integrable systems if the dynamics is smooth everywhere @xcite .",
    "however , integrability is easily broken by breakdown of symmetry or by presence of singularities giving rise to diffraction effects @xcite .",
    "a classical trajectory of an integrable system can be written in terms of fourier modes built on periods corresponding to the canonical angle variables , this is not possible for a chaotic system .",
    "quantum studies @xcite are concentrated on understanding the fluctuations in the level density in terms of invariant structures ( e.g. , periodic orbits ) in phase space . however , for the billiards , the average level density is completely determined by the geometrical features like volume , area , perimeter , etc . owing to a well - known result of weyl @xcite .",
    "thus , one concentrates on the fluctuations in the level density characterized by level correlations , which are eventually studied semiclassically in terms of periodic orbits by employing trace formulae .",
    "perhaps the most popular measure is the nearest - neighbour level - spacing statistics @xcite , @xmath5 giving the frequency of occurrence of certain spacing , @xmath6 for a given spectrum of levels .",
    "for generic integrable systems , it was argued by berry and tabor that the spacing among nearest neighbours is distributed in a poissonian manner @xcite .    statistical study of fluctuations of level density has a mathematical counterpart in statistics of eigenvalues of random matrices @xcite constructed within certain well - defined symmetry constraints .",
    "if a physical system is invariant under rotation and time reversal invariance , then the spectral statistics could be compared to the corresponding random matrices that are real - symmetric .",
    "it is observed that the fluctuation properties of energy levels of quantized time - reversal invariant chaotic systems agree with that of orthogonal ensemble of random matrices exhibiting level repulsion as @xmath7 , for small s @xcite .",
    "however , a linear level repulsion is observed for quantized polygonal billiards @xcite also even when these are non - integrable and non - chaotic @xcite .",
    "this necessitates quest for a parameter which not only varies monotonically with underlying classical description but can also discriminate between chaoticity and non - integrability , independent of random matrix theory and semiclassical theories , however not in disagreement with them .",
    "one of the most significant advantages of this work is in its applicability to _ finite _ sequences of energy levels . in many physical situations , particularly in nuclear physics , the energy levels available are finite in number , of the order less than a hundred . in such situations ,",
    "it becomes inappropriate to apply random matrix theory .",
    "we hope that this work will make a discussion of order - chaos transition in nuclei possible even for realistic systems with some tens of energy levels .",
    "arnold @xcite has employed the stochasticity parameter of kolmogorov @xcite to number sequences of length in tens successfully .",
    "this work is an adaptation of the work by kolmogorov and arnold to energy levels of quantum systems in particular , and to a sequence of modes supported by any physical system in general .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the definition of kolmogorov stochasticity parameter , @xmath0 . based on semiclassical trace formulae ,",
    "semiclassical expressions for the parameter are given for different systems and these are compared with the numerical calculations . putting all these expressions together , we show that @xmath0 scales with the length of the set of energy levels . in section 3 ,",
    "we recapitulate kolmogorov statistic briefly and present some of the applications of this for number sequences , presented recently by arnold @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we present probability distribution functions ( pdf ) of @xmath0 for energy levels of different dynamical systems .",
    "we also present results for zeros of riemann zeta functions , and , for gaussian unitary random matrix ensemble .",
    "finally , we conclude by showing that with these pdfs , we can visualize an order - chaos transition in spectral properties of dynamical systems .",
    "consider a quantum system @xmath8 which possesses energy levels corresponding to its bound states , @xmath9 .",
    "cumulative density of levels is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the degree of degeneracy of the level , @xmath12 .",
    "the average cumulative density of levels can be obtained by various methods for quantum systems . to be specific ,",
    "we take simple systems that are illustrative and very popular in studies in quantum chaos - the two - dimensional quantum billiards and quantized maps .",
    "quantum billiard is a system consisting of a point particle of mass @xmath13 enclosed in a box of a certain shape , @xmath14 ; the solutions of the schrdinger equation are assumed to exist and the eigenvalues @xmath15 are obtained . for such systems , the average cumulative density of levels ,",
    "@xmath16 is given by weyl formula @xcite .",
    "in analogy with the definition given by kolmogorov @xcite , let us define stochasticity parameter , @xmath17 in the limit of @xmath18 , the difference @xmath19 will be just the oscillating part of the density of levels for which we can employ trace formulae @xcite whenever possible . for the eigenvalues of a laplacian ( sometimes related to number theory ) ,",
    "there are trace formulae which can be employed @xcite , one of the well - known being the selberg trace formula .",
    "this further helps us to show that even finite sequence length of size 5000 reproduces the behaviour obtained from trace formulae . in the appendix ,",
    "we have collected the numerical calculations of @xmath1 and compared them with the results based on trace formulae . as can be seen there ,",
    "these results agree well with each other for various billiard systems and maps .",
    "we would like to recall that statistical investigations of @xmath19 have been carried out in the past , albeit with a different normalization , as a measure of quantum chaos in spectra @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the measure was taken as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the limit of the spectral rigidity , @xmath22 as @xmath23 .",
    "it was shown that @xmath24 possesses a limit distribution with zero mean and unit variance for bound , conservative and scaling systems .",
    "for classically ( integrable ) chaotic systems , the distribution was expected to be ( non-)gaussian .",
    "these predictions were verified in a statistical analysis of eigenmodes of superconducting microwave billiards @xcite . for a bunimovich stadium , the three - dimensional sinai billiard , and for limacon billiards , a gaussian distribution was found .",
    "in contrast , for a two - dimensional circular billiard , a non - gaussian distribution was found .",
    "practically , to calculate @xmath25 the numerical procedure followed is sketched as follows : ( i ) sort the given sequence ; ( ii ) find out how many eigenvalues are less than or equal to @xmath26 , from this subtract the expected number of such eigenvalues ( calculated from weyl s formula ) and divide by square root of this number ; ( iii ) vary @xmath26 and then take maximum value of number calculated from the last step , this is @xmath25 for fixed sequence of length @xmath2 .",
    "gutzwiller discovered the connection between density of energy levels of a quantum system and the periodic orbits of the underlying classical system @xcite .",
    "the ensuing trace formulae have been found for quantum systems with underlying classical dynamics from regular to fully chaotic .",
    "for the harmonic oscillator potentials , the trace formula turns out to be analytically exact @xcite . in the following , we use the well - known trace formulae to get the kolmogorov stochasticity parameter , @xmath27 and compare the expressions with numerical results . in the subsequent sections",
    ", we will employ these to study probability density distribution functions of @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the agreement between the numerical and semiclassical results allow us to decide the length of the sequence required in studies in latter sections . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : stopara ] , the agreement of numerical and semiclassical results is very good .",
    "+      studying @xmath25 for various systems discussed above as a function of @xmath28 ( fig.[fig : def_alpha ] ) reveals an exponential fall for riemann zeros and weaker exponential curves for other systems . indeed ,",
    "on comparing each of them with @xmath29 , we extract a monotonically changing index , @xmath30 varying from 0.15 for circular billiard to 0.45 for riemann zeros with a value 0.34 for the chaotic standard map .",
    "the values of this index are listed in table i. these show an increasing trend as the system becomes classically chaotic .    .",
    "this brings out an interesting observation , @xmath31 scales as @xmath32 .",
    "this leads us to finding the best fitted values for the index , @xmath30 .",
    "as the systems become increasingly stochastic , the value of the index increases . ]    we may understand the scaling exponent @xmath4 heuristically in the following manner .",
    "for integrable systems , like rectangle the trace formula contains bessel function and a trigonometric function for @xmath26-dependence apart from @xmath33 dependence in the denominator . for large @xmath26 ,",
    "@xmath34 $ ] .",
    "after a little simplification one will see that @xmath35 \\nonumber \\\\ & - & e^{-1/2 } [ g_1 ( \\sqrt{e } ) + g_2(\\sqrt{e})]|.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 s and @xmath11 s are trigonometric functions ( @xmath37 ) of @xmath38 .",
    "this leads to an scaling with a maximal exponent of about 0.25 in asymptotic limit with an oscillatory dependence with an argument containing @xmath38 .    for the riemann zeta function",
    "it is just the denominator modified by the oscillatory behavior of oscillatory function which , to a good approximation may be written as @xmath39 .",
    "note that the above heuristic argument give a ratio of @xmath0 for the zeta function ( = 0.6 ) to that for rectangle ( = 0.25 ) is 2.4 while the numerically found ratio 0.4451/0.18 is 2.47 - they are close .    from @xcite , one may expect scaling behaviour because the systems considered here are scaling systems in the sense discussed above .",
    "since the average level density used in the definition of @xmath31 is a continuous function , it renders a continuum character to @xmath31 itself which in turn makes it possible to obtain the cumulative probability distribution function,@xmath40 of variables , @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath40 gives the probability of the stochasticity parameter to have a value @xmath41 . in the case of independent identically",
    "distributed random variables , this distribution is indeed a limiting distribution of kolmogorov @xcite , @xmath42 it grows from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath45 is @xmath46 .",

    "larger stochastic probability is obtained for a geometric progression than an arithmetic one , with only fifteen numbers .",
    "the stochastic probability of a sequence is quantified by the value @xmath47 where @xmath48 is obtained according to the definition above .      as suggested by arnold @xcite",
    ", it will be very interesting to extend kolmogorov formula to the more general situation for random variable having continuous cumulative distribution function .",
    "for the dynamical systems considered here , we have such a continuous distribution function .",
    "this gives us an opportunity to propose some of the extensions of kolmogorov formula .",
    "we present results from our numerical investigations as well as analytic calculations based on trace formulae .",
    "the numerical evaluation of a probability distribution function is summarized in the following steps :    * for an ordered sequence of length @xmath2 , we can have @xmath2-subsequences of length @xmath49 , always starting from the lowest element and increasing by one element ; * for each subsequence we calculate @xmath0 ; * this way , we end - up with @xmath2 , @xmath31s and a histogram of these @xmath31s gives the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of @xmath31 for the sequence .      for the integrable billiards like circle , rectangle , and equilateral triangle , the values of the stochasticity parameter , @xmath31 are respectively 0.19 , 0.13 , and 0.12 , all comparable ; these values are stable with the length of the sequence",
