    "the optomechanical cooling of mechanical oscillators has witnessed considerable progress in the last few years , leading to the expectation that a large class of such oscillators will soon be cooled to near their quantum - mechanical ground state of vibration .",
    "in addition to the _ top - down _ approach where cooling proceeds by mounting macroscopic oscillators as moving mirrors in an optical resonator @xcite  often but not always the end - mirror of a fabry - prot interferometer , there has also been increased interest in considering _ bottom - up _ situations . in that case",
    "the mechanical oscillator consists of a momentum side mode of an ultracold atomic system trapped inside a high-@xmath0 optical cavity with fixed mirrors .",
    "the trapped atoms can be either a thermal sample @xcite , a quantum - degenerate bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite , or even a quantum - degenerate gas of fermions @xcite . in that bottom - up situation the mechanical oscillator(s ) consist of _",
    "collective _ momentum modes of the trapped gas , excited via photon recoil @xcite .",
    "specifically , in the case of a condensate the intracavity standing - wave field couples the macroscopically occupied zero - momentum component of the bec to a symmetric superposition of the states with center - of - mass momentum @xmath1 via virtual electric dipole transitions .",
    "it is known that when considering the mechanical effects of light on atoms by quantized light fields , there are situations where a standing wave does not lead to the same diffraction pattern as a superposition of two counterpropagating running waves of equal frequencies @xcite .",
    "this is because in contrast to a standing wave , running waves in principle permit one to extract `` which way '' information about the matter - wave diffraction process .",
    "this begs the question whether a description of the intracavity light field in terms of a standing wave is always appropriate to describe the optomechanical effects of feeble light fields on ultracold atoms . as a first step toward answering this question",
    ", this paper addresses the somewhat simpler question of understanding the difference between _ classical _ standing wave and counterpropagating light fields , that is , the difference in optomechanical properties of condensates trapped in , say , a fabry - prot and a ring cavity .",
    "one main consequence of the presence of two counterpropagating running waves is that in addition to a symmetric `` cosine '' momentum side mode , it is now possible to excite an out - of - phase `` sine '' mode as well . in the optomechanics analogy",
    ", this indicates that two coupled `` condensate mirrors '' of equal oscillation frequencies but in general different masses are driven by the intracavity field .",
    "this can result in complex multistable behaviors that we analyze in some detail in the following sections .",
    "the dynamical interaction between becs and counterpropagating light fields has a long history .",
    "the cooperative scattering of light and atoms in ultracold atomic systems , including experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies of superradiance in becs and coherent atom recoil lasing ( carl ) @xcite has been the subject of a number of studies , see ref .",

    "section ii describes our model of a bec interacting with two counterpropagating fields in a ring cavity .",
    "it introduces a description of the condensate that clearly illustrates an optomechanical analogy involving two mirrors driven by the intracavity field . in the semiclassical limit where the light fields are treated classically , the dynamics of these two `` mirrors ''",
    "can be understood in terms of an interference effect between the propagating fields .",
    "we further discuss conditions under which one of the mirrors can be trapped into a dark state .",
    "section iii discusses the steady - state properties of the system , and comments on the appearance of isolated branches of solutions , or `` isolas ''  @xcite .",
    "we then turn in section iv to the dynamics of the system , considering in particular the response of the condensate to a sweep of the frequency of the external pump lasers .",
    "finally , section v is a summary and outlook .",
    "we consider a bec of @xmath2 two - level bosonic atoms with transition frequency @xmath3 trapped inside one arm of a high-@xmath0 optical ring cavity supporting two counterpropagating traveling - wave fields of frequency @xmath4 and driven by two coherent pump fields of identical frequency @xmath5 and complex amplitudes @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the light fields are taken to be far detuned from the atomic transition so that the excited electronic state of the atoms can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "we further assume that the atom trap is sufficiently soft that the condensate can be assumed to be homogeneous along the axis of the resonator .",
    "for simplicity we neglect transverse effects and describe both the condensate and the light fields as plane waves , thereby reducing the description of the problem to one dimension .",

    ", we find it convenient to use a sine and cosine basis , so that @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cavity length and @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the bosonic annihilation operators of the zero - momentum mode , the cosine mode , and the sine mode respectively .",

    "the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the atomic recoil frequency .",
    "this hamiltonian can be further simplified since for weak optical fields and large @xmath2 the depletion of the initial condensate remains weak .",
    "we then treat the zero - momentum mode classically , @xmath33 .",
    "we further introduce the ` position ' operators @xmath34 and the corresponding ` momentum ' operators @xmath35 where @xmath36 , resulting in the hamiltonian being mapped to the optomechanical hamiltonian @xmath37 in this form , the hamiltonian provides a simple physical picture : the sine and cosine momentum side modes of the condensate behave as a pair of mirrors driven by the interference between the two counter - propagating intracavity light fields . as such",
    ", they can be thought of as a `` bottom - up '' realization of coupled mirrors driven by the radiation pressure .",
    "we return to this point shortly , but first derive the coupled equations of motion of the light - condensate mirrors system .    in practice",
    "the sine and cosine momentum modes are coupled to other momentum side modes as a result of the presence of a trapping potential that is otherwise ignored in our discussion .",
    "this results in a damping of the population of these modes , and associated noise operators .",
    "the resulting quantum langevin equations obtained from the hamiltonian   are therefore @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the linewidth of the ring cavity , @xmath40 is the stark - shifted cavity - pump detuning , and the side - mode damping rate @xmath41 affects both position and momentum , as discussed in ref .",
    "all noise operators , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , etc . are assumed to have zero mean .    in the remainder of this paper",

    "similarly , the cosine mode can become a dark state for out - of - phase and equal amplitude intracavity fields , see fig .  1 .",
    "we show in the next section that these dark states are useful in understanding the steady - state properties of the system .",
    "interestingly , in high-@xmath0 fabry - prot resonators it is usually appropriate to describe the intracavity light field as a standing - wave , a cosine - wave if the origin is chosen as the center of the resonators . in that case , only the cosine momentum side mode of the condensate is excited , and the problem reduces to the familiar bec optomechanical situation of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we remark that even in fabry - prot interferometers it is strictly speaking never completely appropriate to ignore the other mode , the sine mode of the optical field , unless the mirrors are perfectly reflecting ( and infinitely heavy ) .",
    "this is especially so in the limit of feeble quantized fields , certainly the quantum fluctuations of the cosine mode are always present .",
    "it will be interesting in future work to determine the extent to which the two bec ` mirrors ' under consideration here can develop quantum correlations between the two light fields , leading e.g. to @xmath49 , with similar behavior for the sine and cosine side modes .",
    "as such , this system may provide a sensitive test - bed to generate and study the onset of quantum correlations in this optically driven bose condensate .",

    "in this paper we have presented a classical analysis of the fundamental optomechanical modes of a bose - einstein condensate trapped inside a ring cavity .",
    "in contrast to the situation of a fabry - prot cavity there are now two such modes , symmetric(cosine ) and antisymmetric(sine ) ones .",
    "these sine and cosine modes act as two coupled `` condensate mirrors '' of equal frequencies , their coupling resulting in a rich steady - state behavior , including for instance the appearance if isolas for an appropriate choice of parameters .",
    "one important feature of these modes is that together with the original condensate they form a v - system , with the upper levels  the sine and cosine modes  driven by a two - photon process involving both counterpropagating light fields .",
    "one or the other of these modes can then become a dark state as a result of destructive interferences between the two counterpropagating fields .",
    "this is of course a classical effect : in the case of quantized optical and matter - wave fields quantum fluctuations will normally prevent these modes from becoming perfectly dark .",
    "it follows that measuring correlation functions of the optical field provides a direct means to probe the quantum properties of the matter - wave side modes .",
    "future work will examine these aspects of ring - cavity optomechanics in detail , both when quantum fluctuations can be treated as small fluctuations about a classical mean , and in the limit of very feeble fields where this approach is no longer appropriate .",
    "we will also revisit the fabry - p ' erot case to include both the standing - wave mode that is normally included in the analysis , as well as the second frequency - degenerate but out - of - phase optical mode that needs to also be included and can become significantly excited for low mirror reflectivities .",
