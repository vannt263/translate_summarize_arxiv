    "galaxy interactions are well known to induce bursts of star formation within the central kiloparsecs of galaxies and within their tidally - distorted features ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it has been previously suggested that star formation is manifested in different kinds of stellar  packaging , \" like isolated stars , bound groups , loose associations , globular clusters , and dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is now evident , however , that clustered star formation is the sole product of star forming activity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , shaped by a number of disruption mechanisms to produce field stars and associations .",
    "tidal tails have lower extinctions and less complicated star formation histories  and resulting stellar populations  than galaxy interiors .",
    "they therefore present a unique opportunity to study a relatively observationally simple , yet physically interesting environment , and assess how it shapes cluster sizes , color and magnitude distributions , and statistical properties .",
    "we may also compare what is observed in these environments to prior studies of galaxy interiors .",
    "we report our recent work in elucidating this issue with general diagnostics of cluster candidates detected in _ hst _ wfpc2 images .",
    "this represents a pilot study of using a large sample of galaxies with limited bandpass coverage to uncover the physics of star cluster formation and survival ; a test of how to do more with less .",
    "the sample of tidal tails is presented in figure 1 as sloan digital sky survey images with wfpc2 fields of view overlaid .",
    "these systems were selected to represent a range of optical brightnesses , merger ages , hi column densities and masses , interaction mass ratios , and presence of tidal dwarf candidates ( mullan et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "a full description of observations and data reduction procedures for these systems will be presented in mullan et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . in summary , star cluster candidates were detected using the daofind program in the iraf package daophot .",
    "the criteria for selection and follow - up extinction- and charge transfer efficiency - corrected photometry ( @xcite ; @xcite ) with the phot task of apphot were chosen to emulate @xcite , including the criterion @xmath3 @xmath4 2.0 .",
    "this allows populations of old , metal poor globular clusters ( @xmath3 @xmath5 1 ) akin to those observed in the galaxy @xcite , as well as metal - rich clusters with @xmath3 @xmath4 1.5 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this also allows solar metallicity globular clusters with @xmath3 @xmath5 1.21.3 ( lee , lee , & gibson 2002 ) .",
    "the tail regions were defined in @xmath0- band , gaussian - smoothed images as contours set to one count above the average background , corresponding to 24.3  25.7 mag arcsec@xmath6 in @xmath0 .",
    "central galaxies , where present in the images , were excluded based on where their radial brightness profiles indicated anti - truncated disk debris @xcite .",
    "our detections are 50% complete to @xmath7 25.7 , and k - s tests indicate that in - tail sources are not likely drawn from the same population as the out - of - tail sources ( p @xmath4 0.1 in most cases ) .",
    "figure 2 shows an image of a representative system , ngc 2992 , with in - tail cluster candidates indicated with circles and squares for out - of - tail objects meeting the same selection criteria . a color - magnitude diagram for the in - tail objects",
    "is also presented , with photometric model tracks of 10@xmath8 , 10@xmath9 , and 10@xmath10 m@xmath11 simple stellar populations with instantaneous - burst star formation rates @xcite overlaid .",
    "although two photometric bands are insufficient to draw robust conclusions on individual masses and mass functions , rough estimates and limits can be made . in all systems ,",
    "v@xmath12 and @xmath13 indicate that the most massive clusters are @xmath5 10@xmath8 m@xmath11 .",
    "we do not find clusters in our sample with masses @xmath14 10@xmath15 m@xmath11 .    by counting the number of in - tail cluster candidates per unit area of the tail , and subtracting the number of sources found with the same selection criteria outside the tail per unit area of non - tail wfpc2 regions",
    ", we find a cluster candidate surface density for each system .",
    "figure 3 compares our results to those of @xcite , given an additional m@xmath2 @xmath4 -8.5 ( johnson - cousins system ) cutoff .",
    "on the surface , our results are compatible with @xcite who find similar values , though we contend that accounting for rapid cluster fading with age by extending the limit to fainter magnitudes and improving upon background subtraction reveals clusters in every star - forming tail ( mullan et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "also provided is a typical statistical diagnostic for the cluster populations , a plot of the brightest m@xmath16vs .",
    "the logarithm of the number of clusters detected for each system .",
    "the slope of this correlation , -2.50 @xmath17 -0.05 , is similar to the -2.3 @xmath17 0.2 value found for other extragalactic environments @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggests that this statistical size - of - sample effect can be produced from a schechter cimf with a exponential slope of -2 and cutoff ( m@xmath18 ) mass of @xmath19 2.1 @xmath20 10@xmath9 m@xmath11 , given cluster disruption mechanisms from gas expulsion , relaxation , stellar evolution , and the external environment ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) . in many cases such as ngc 6872e and am 1054 - 325w , the profusion of sources between 10@xmath9  10@xmath8 m@xmath11 may indicate higher star formation efficiencies from high gmc compression by a turbulent ism @xcite or through a similar magnetohydrodynamic effect @xcite in these  ideal \" star - forming tails .",
    "this may also affect the luminosity function , whose luminosity - dependent logarithmic slope of -2.5 as sampled in this v@xmath12 range ( see the contribution by gieles ; @xcite ) may change with the altered cimf .",
    "but without any clusters of mass 10@xmath15 m@xmath11 , the star formation efficiencies in these tails may not be as high as in the antennae , m82 , ngc 1316 , ngc 7252 , or arp 220 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "preliminary evidence suggests that star cluster populations are governed by similar luminosity and initial mass functions as their cousins in field galaxies .",
    "our set of 17 tails show a maximum cluster mass of @xmath510@xmath8 m@xmath11 , while the brightest m@xmath21 vs.  log n plot is consistent with both mass - dependent and mass - independent prescriptions of cluster disruption (  infant mortality \" ) , with subsequent dissolution from 2-body relaxation and stellar evolution for clusters drawn from a schechter cimf .",
    "such a cimf , if it had a higher cutoff mass , would imply higher star formation efficiencies , aided by turbulent pressure in the tidal tails .",
    "future work will address these areas through further analysis of the color , magnitude , and size distributions of these clusters , as well as the kinematics and ism composition of their surrounding environments ."
