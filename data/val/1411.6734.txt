    "the problem of wave transport in disordered systems has been extensively studied in the literature , both for uncorrelated disorder ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , as well as for the case in which the disordered potential shows correlations @xcite .",
    "common features of the problems investigated by our group in refs .",
    "@xcite are that i ) uncorrelated disordered is contemplated , and ii ) the size of the individual scatterers that compose the disordered system is the smallest one occurring in the problem : in particular , it is much smaller than the wavelength of the wave sent along the waveguide , and is thus of no physical relevance . in these models , each individual potential , statistically independent from the others ,",
    "is modeled by a delta function , and the distance between successive scatterers is subsequently taken to be very small , which allows considering the so - called dense weak - scattering limit ( dwsl ) , an important ingredient in the analysis carried out in those references .",
    "various quantities of physical interest were investigated within this framework , like the conductance , its fluctuations , and the individual transmission coefficients of the disordered system .",
    "a particularly attractive property that was found is the insensitivity of the results to details of the individual - scatterer statistical distribution , expressed in the form of a central - limit theorem .    in the present paper we build on previous work @xcite to study the simplest extension of the problems contemplated in refs .",
    "@xcite : the problem of wave transport in 1d disordered systems , in which the various scatterers have a finite size .",
    "specifically , we consider a succession of @xmath0 barriers and wells , to be referred to , generically , as steps , having a finite width .",
    "the potential under study is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ rand_steps ] below .",
    "it contains @xmath0 steps , assumed to be weak compared with the energy @xmath6 .",
    "the steps are characterized by :    \\i ) a fixed width @xmath7 which may fit an arbitrary number of wavelengths @xmath8 , where the parameter @xmath3 , @xmath9 being the wave number of the incident wave , will be referred to as the _ phase parameter_.    \\ii ) random heights @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 heights @xmath10 are statistically independent of one another ; the @xmath0 distributions are uniform , with zero average , and identical to one another .",
    "the same model has been analyzed later in ref .",
    "@xcite , using a mapping to a  classical phase space \" and iterating that map .",
    "systems with similar characteristics have been studied in the past and denoted as periodic - on - average systems , and authors would speak of kronig - penney - like models ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . e. g. , they study models where all 1d states are localized , but one group shows regular anderson behavior , and a second group , related to gap states , has non - universal properties @xcite .",
    "also , the localization length is found to be very small in the gaps and much larger in the bands @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the surprising result is found that the transmission coefficient for frequencies associated with the gap in the band structure of the periodic system increases with increasing disorder , for sufficiently weak disorder .    in the problem to be studied in the present paper ( along the lines of the model outlined above ) ,",
    "we elaborate on previous investigations on disordered systems which are periodic on average , and carry on the following analysis .",

    "\\iii ) we can perform such a detailed study thanks to the fact that we are able to provide an _ exact theoretical solution _ for the average resistance of the system .",
    "we verify this exact solution by means of _",
    "computer simulations_.    \\iv ) in addition to the exact solution , we also provide a more _ qualitative _ analysis , based on : + a ) _ perturbation theory _ , that gives a better physical insight , and + b ) the behavior of a finite stretch of a _ periodic kronig - penney model_.    to carry on this program , the physical quantities we study are the landauer resistance of the chain @xcite and its landauer - bttiker conductance @xcite @xmath12 ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the reflection and transmission coefficients of the chain ) averaged over an ensemble of realizations , as functions of the number of scatterers @xmath0 and the phase parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the point of view adopted in the present paper is very much oriented towards condensed matter , although the results are actually much more general , as they have to do with wave propagation . we may mention that in the domain of ultracold atoms , anderson localization has been studied and , more impressively ,",
    "localized matter waves in a bose - einstein condensate have been observed ( see , e. g. , @xcite ) .",
