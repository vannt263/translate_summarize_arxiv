    "recent development of cold polar - molecule sources promises to reveal many interesting , and hitherto unexplored , molecular interaction dynamics .",
    "the permanent electric dipole moment possessed by polar molecules provides a new type of interaction in the ultracold environment . this electric dipole - dipole interaction ( and",
    "control over it ) should give rise to unique physics and chemistry including novel cold - collision dynamics  @xcite and quantum information processing  @xcite .    to date , cold polar - molecule samples have been produced most successfully via three different mechanisms : buffer gas cooling  @xcite ; photo- and magneto - association  @xcite ; and stark deceleration  @xcite .",
    "buffer gas cooling achieves temperatures below 1 k through thermalization of molecules with a he buffer .",
    "this technique produces relatively large densities ( @xmath0 @xmath1 ) of polar ground - state molecules .",
    "however , cooling below @xmath2 mk has not yet been achieved because the he buffer gas has not been removed quickly enough for evaporative cooling  @xcite .",
    "photoassociation achieves the lowest molecular temperatures of these techniques ( @xmath3100 @xmath4k ) , but is limited to molecules whose atomic constituents are amenable to laser - cooling .",
    "furthermore , molecules in their ground vibrational state are not readily produced , yielding species with relatively small effective electric dipoles , although this problem can be overcome with more sophisticated laser control techniques  @xcite .",
    "stark deceleration exists as an alternative to these methods as the technique employs well - characterized supersonic beam methods  @xcite to produce large densities of ground state polar molecules ( @xmath310@xmath5 @xmath1 ) , albeit at high packet velocities .",
    "one limitation of this technique for trapping of decelerated molecules is an observed drastic loss of slowed molecules at very low mean velocities in both our own group s work and the berlin group of g. meijer  @xcite .",
    "we address this problem in this article .    as the leading method for producing cold samples of chemically interesting polar molecules ,",
    "stark deceleration has generated cold samples of co  @xcite , nd@xmath6  @xcite , oh  @xcite , ybf  @xcite , h@xmath7co  @xcite , nh  @xcite , and so@xmath8  @xcite , leading to the trapping of both nd@xmath6",
    "@xcite and oh  @xcite .",
    "given the importance of stark deceleration to the study of cold molecules , it is crucial that the technique be refined to achieve maximum deceleration efficiency . in this work ,",
    "we provide a detailed description of processes that limit the efficiency of current decelerators and propose methods for overcoming them .",
    "we propose possible solutions to the parametric transverse / longitudinal coupling loss originally highlighted in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as elucidate a new loss mechanism unique to producing the slowest molecules .",
    "we restrict the described simulations and theory to stark decelerated , ground - state oh radicals , as the supporting experimental data was taken with this molecular species .",
    "however , the loss mechanisms described herein are not specific to oh , and represent a general limitation of current stark decelerators .",
    "this reduces the efficiency of stark decelerators for trapping cold polar molecules .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the mechanisms responsible for molecular loss at low velocities .",
    "sections iii , iv , and v present methods of producing molecular packets at intermediate velocities ( @xmath9100 m / s ) without the distributed transverse / longitudinal coupling losses of ref .",
    "however , these methods exacerbate the problem of low - velocity loss .",
    "therefore , we propose a new decelerator design in section vi that exhibits gain over conventional stark deceleration to velocities as low as 14 m / s .",
    "in much of the previous work on stark deceleration , it is assumed that all motion parallel and transverse to the decelerator axis is stable up to some maximum excursion velocity and position from the beam center  @xcite , enabling the derivation of an analytical solution to predict stable - molecule phase - space area .",
    "however , there are several important instances where the assumptions of this model become invalid . in the case of very slow molecules ( @xmath1050 m / s ) , , where @xmath4 is the effective electric dipole moment and @xmath11 is the mass of the given molecule . ]",
    "we observe two distinct phenomena leading to reduced decelerator efficiency at the final deceleration stages : transverse overfocusing and longitudinal reflection .",
    "transverse overfocusing occurs when the decelerated molecules speed becomes so low that the decelerating electrodes focus the molecules too tightly ( transversely ) and they either make contact with the electrodes or are strongly dispersed upon exiting the decelerator .",
    "longer decelerators tend to exacerbate this effect due to the fact that molecules can travel at low speeds for many stages . nonetheless , there are several motivating factors for constructing a longer decelerator .",
    "first , longer decelerators allow less energy per stage to be removed and consequently lead to larger longitudinal phase - space acceptance .",
    "second , a longer decelerator may allow deceleration of molecules possessing an unfavorable stark shift to mass ratio .",
    "we will discuss critical issues for use of such long decelerators for slow molecule production .",
    "a second low - velocity effect , which we have denoted  longitudinal reflection , \" is a direct result of the spatial inhomogeneity of the electric field at the final deceleration stage . as highlighted in the context of transverse guidance in ref .",
    "@xcite , the longitudinal potential is largest for those molecules passing  in the transverse dimension ",
    "nearest to the decelerator rods .",
    "however , the decelerator switching sequence is generally only synchronous to a molecule on - axis traveling at the mean speed of the packet . as a result ,",
    "when the mean longitudinal kinetic energy of the slowed packet becomes comparable to the stark potential barrier at the last stage , molecules off - axis can be stopped or reflected , resulting in a spatial filtering effect .",
    "furthermore , the longitudinal velocity spread of the molecular packet at the final stage , if larger than the final mean velocity , can lead to reflection of the slowest portion of the packet .",
    "it is important that the phenomena of overfocusing and longitudinal reflection be addressed since molecule traps fed by stark decelerators require slow packets for efficient loading .    to illustrate these low - velocity effects , the number of phase - stable molecules predicted by three - dimensional ( 3d ) monte carlo simulation is shown in fig .  [ cm2loss](a ) as a function of stage number for increasing phase angle",
    "we define the deceleration phase angle , @xmath12 , exactly as in previous publications , where @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the length of one slowing stage is given by @xmath14 ( 5.5 mm for our machine ) , while the molecule position between successive stages is denoted as @xmath15 .",
    "we define @xmath16 to be exactly between two slowing stages , therefore , @xmath17 ( bunching ) yields no net deceleration .",
    "phase angles satisfying @xmath18 lead to deceleration of the molecular packet , while the maximum energy is removed for @xmath19 .",
    "the 3d simulation results displayed in fig .  [ cm2loss](a ) include both longitudinal and transverse effects .",
    "the molecules have an initial velocity ( @xmath20 ) of 380 m / s , corresponding to the mean velocity of a molecular pulse created via supersonic expansion in xe .",
    "all simulations and experimental data hereafter possess this @xmath20 unless otherwise noted .",
    "as expected , a higher phase angle leads to a smaller number of decelerated molecules .",
    "however , there is a sharp loss of molecules in the last several deceleration stages for the highest phase of @xmath21 .",
    "this value of @xmath12 produces a packet possessing a final velocity ( @xmath22 ) of 14 m / s .",
    "this loss is attributed to transverse overfocusing and longitudinal reflection .",
    "these distinct effects are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cm2loss](b ) , which displays the transverse ( trace 1 ) and longitudinal ( trace 2 ) fractional loss rate of molecules traversing the final three slowing stages at @xmath21 , @xmath23 m / s .",
    "the switching time for each stage is denoted by a vertical dashed line , which is labeled by the corresponding stage number .",
    "longitudinal reflection of molecules is clearly the dominant loss mechanism for the lowest final velocity shown in fig .",
    "[ cm2loss](a ) . nonetheless , there also exists a non - negligible rise in transverse losses at the final stage .",
    "that is , because the molecular beam is moving very slowly in the last few deceleration stages , the transverse guiding fields of the decelerator electrodes have a greater focusing effect on the molecules ( see eq . 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and focus the molecules so tightly that they collide with a deceleration stage and are lost . in the case of our decelerator , this leads to loss of 20% of the decelerated molecule number between @xmath24 ( 50 m / s ) and @xmath25 ( 14 m / s ) .",
    "such a dramatic loss is not predicted by analytical theory , as the stable phase - space area decreases by only @xmath101% over this range of @xmath26 .",
    "this number is calculated directly after the decelerator is switched - off and is thus an upper bound , since experiments employing these cold molecules require them to travel out of the decelerator where transverse spread can lead to dramatic loss of molecule number .    experimental evidence of this sudden decrease in molecule number at very low velocities is given in fig .",
    "[ tofs=1 ] , which displays time - of - flight ( tof ) spectra along with corresponding monte carlo simulation results at various phase angles .",
    "the decelerated oh molecules are in the weak - field seeking @xmath27 state .",
    "the first two quantum numbers of the state denote its hyperfine components , while the third number indicates the parity of the state in the absence of electric fields .",
    "figures  [ tofs=1](b ) and ( c ) illustrate progressive time delays of the slowed molecular packets from the background of non - synchronous molecules .",
    "figures  [ tofs=1](d ) and ( e ) display only the decelerated packets , and the vertical axes of these plots are magnified by a factor of 100 .",
    "the dual peaks correspond to molecular packets loaded into two successive stages , and the later peaks represent the intended final velocities . the total detected and simulated molecule numbers are plotted in fig .",
    "[ tofs=1](f ) as a function of final velocity , along with the theoretically expected decelerator efficiency ( dashed line )  @xcite .",
    "note that the sudden population decrease in both simulation and experimental results is not reflected in the one - dimensional theoretical model , which does not account for the transverse dynamics or field inhomogeneities that cause such behavior .",
    "this effect is detrimental to the production of dense samples of cold molecules .    to remove the overfocusing effect at low velocities , the transverse focusing of the last several decelerator stages",
    "needs to be reduced .",
    "different types of transverse focusing elements may be inserted into the deceleration beam line to compensate for this phenomenon .",
    "this idea is discussed in detail in sections iv - vi .",
    "we note that the proposed solutions , while successful in addressing the detrimental longitudinal / transverse coupling effects , do not mitigate the problem of longitudinal reflection at low velocities .",
    "coupling between transverse and longitudinal motion throughout the deceleration sequence invalidates the assumptions made in ref .",
    "the fact that the transverse guidance of the molecular beam comes from the same electrodes that provide the deceleration means that the longitudinal and transverse motions are necessarily coupled .",
    "while this phenomenon is well understood in the field of accelerator physics  @xcite , it was first pointed out in the context of stark deceleration in ref .",
    "the result can be seen in the left column of fig .",
    "[ pscompare ] , where the longitudinal phase space of oh packets is shown versus increasing phase angle . in fig .",
    "[ pscompare ] , the dark lines represent the separatrix , partitioning stable deceleration phase space from that of unstable motion as calculated from eq . 2 in ref .",
    "each dot represents the position in phase space of a simulated molecule . in the absence of coupling between the longitudinal and transverse motions",
    ", one would expect the entire area inside the separatrix to be occupied .",
    "therefore , the structure in these graphs is evidence of the importance of the transverse motion .    in the left column of fig .",
    "[ pscompare ] , the coupling of longitudinal and transverse motions is responsible for two effects : first , in the center of the stable area at @xmath17near the synchronous molecule  the density of stable molecules is less than in the surrounding area .",
    "this is because molecules that oscillate very near the synchronous molecule experience little transverse guiding .",
    "this effect is not dramatic and is only discernable for an exceedingly large number of stages .",
    "furthermore , this effect is even less important for the increased phase angles typically used for deceleration , since for these switching sequences the synchronous molecule experiences more of the transverse guiding forces than it does during bunching .",
    "the second effect , which is much more evident , is the absence of molecules at intermediate distances from the synchronous molecule as shown in the left column of fig  [ pscompare ] .",
    "this so - called ` halo ' is due to parametric amplification of the transverse motion and is similar to the effects seen in cold molecule storage rings  @xcite as well as charged particle accelerators  @xcite .",
    "essentially , the longitudinal oscillation frequency of a molecule in this region is matched to the transverse oscillation frequency , leading to amplification of the transverse and longitudinal motion and consequent loss .",
    "there is a compromise between decreasing longitudinal phase - space area and increasing transverse guidance for increasing @xmath12 . to demonstrate this effect ,",
    "we decelerate molecules to a fixed @xmath22 and vary the phase angle used to reach this velocity .",
    "this is done either by changing the voltage applied to the decelerator rods or by modifying the effective length of the decelerator itself for each @xmath12 of interest .",
    "the experimental data shown in fig .  [ vlchange ] is the result of varying the voltage applied to our decelerator rods ( squares ) and the effective decelerator length ( circles ) .",
    "both lowering the decelerator voltage and using shorter lengths of the decelerator for slowing requires increasing @xmath12 to observe the same @xmath22 of 50 m / s .",
    "we are able to effectively shorten the decelerator by initially bunching the packet for a given number of stages before beginning a slowing sequence .",
    "note that we use @xmath28 bunching to remove any transverse / longitudinal couplings during these first stages , then switch back to @xmath29 slowing for the remainder of the decelerator .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 signifies the mode of decelerator operation and is previously defined in ref .",
    "@xcite as well as in section iv . the phase stable region of @xmath29 for @xmath31 is entirely contained within that of @xmath28 at @xmath17 , therefore no artifacts from initial velocity filtering are present in this data .",
    "we observe that , contrary to the predictions of the one - dimensional theory  @xcite , a higher phase angle can lead to greater decelerator efficiency up to some maximum @xmath12 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of distributed transverse / longitudinal couplings illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pscompare ] . at even larger phase angles ,",
    "the longitudinal phase - space acceptance becomes a limiting factor .",
    "the labels next to each data point correspond to either the voltage applied to the decelerator rods ( squares ) or the number of utilized @xmath29 slowing stages ( circles ) . figure  [ vlchange ] further illustrates that the transverse / longitudinal couplings outlined by ref .",
    "@xcite reduce decelerator efficiency , and are highly dependent on phase angle .",
    "the coupling between longitudinal and transverse motion is detrimental to efficient operation of a stark decelerator , reducing the total number of decelerated molecules .",
    "this effect will be even worse for decelerating molecules with an unfavorable stark shift - to - mass ratio .",
    "fortunately , the transverse and longitudinal motions can be decoupled by introducing a transverse focusing element to the deceleration beam line that overwhelms the transverse focusing provided by the deceleration electrodes in analogy to the focusing magnets of charged - beam machines .",
    "this technique also has the advantage of providing a larger stable region in the transverse phase space which further enhances the decelerated molecule number .",
    "the remainder of this manuscript discusses methods of implementing a transverse focusing element to decouple the longitudinal and transverse motion .",
    "sections iv and v describe methods that can be implemented by modifying the timing sequences of present decelerators with moderate success at intermediate @xmath22 .",
    "section vi presents an improved design for a stark decelerator that solves this problem of distributed longitudinal and transverse loss and also reduces the previously described overfocusing losses at the final stage .",
    "the simplest method for introducing a transverse focusing element to the decelerator beam line is to let the molecules fly through an energized deceleration stage without removing the field . in this manner ,",
    "molecules experience the transverse focusing of the entire stage without their longitudinal motion affected .",
    "traditional longitudinal phase stability requires the switching of the fields to occur on an upward slope of the molecular potential energy , i.e. , faster molecules are slowed more while slower molecules are slowed less than the synchronous molecule . hence , it is necessary to de - sample the bunching switching rate by an odd factor ( 3,5,7 ... ) : the so - called decelerator overtones  @xcite . for convenience ,",
    "we define the quantity @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the synchronous molecule velocity and the switching speed @xmath34 is given as the stage spacing @xmath14 divided by the switching time - interval .",
    "reference  @xcite considered only the bunching case . in this work ,",
    "we generalize to the case of actual deceleration . however , the above definition of @xmath30 is still valid .",
    "that is , @xmath30 is constant despite the fact that both @xmath33 and @xmath34 vary when @xmath35 . with this definition",
    "we see that traditional deceleration can be described by @xmath36 , while the method of de - sampling the switch rate by a factor 3 is described by @xmath37 .",
    "these two methods of deceleration can be seen in figs .",
    "[ decelerationschemes ] ( b ) and ( c ) , where their respective switching schemes are shown for @xmath38 . by switching at one - third the rate , the molecule packet flies through a deceleration stage that is energized and experiences enhanced transverse guiding .",
    "longitudinal phase space simulations of @xmath37 slowing at various phase angles are shown in the right column of fig .",
    "[ pscompare ] .",
    "no structure is present in these plots . also , the region of longitudinal phase stability for @xmath37even at @xmath17is reduced compared to @xmath36 .",
    "this is because the maximum stable velocity , as calculated from eqs . 2 and 6 of ref .",
    "@xcite , depends on the spacing between deceleration stages as @xmath39 , and thus , the separatrix velocity bound is reduced by a factor of @xmath40 .",
    "nonetheless , the absence of coupling to the transverse motion leads to a larger number of molecules for the @xmath38 case shown in the uppermost panel of fig .",
    "[ pscompare ] . in a given decelerator",
    ", @xmath41 slowing requires a factor of three higher phase angle than @xmath29 to reach the same final velocity . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pscompare ] , this fact severely limits the practicality of @xmath28 as a deceleration scheme , as it implies a dramatic reduction in velocity acceptance at the highest phase angles .",

    "are decelerated to roughly the same velocity .",
    "there is a slight difference at the highest phase angles shown because the total number of stages in our decelerator ( 142 ) is not an exact multiple of 3 . in fig .",
    "[ s3s1compare](b ) the de - convolved total molecule number for each of these packets is plotted versus final speed . while the @xmath37 method dominates over @xmath36 for small phase angles , its effectiveness decreases as the deceleration becomes more aggressive  by 224 m / s , the @xmath36 molecule number is already larger than that of @xmath37 .",
    "this behavior is expected since the phase angle used to decelerate to 224 m / s is @xmath46 , while the required @xmath36 phase angle is only @xmath47 . although the @xmath37 longitudinal phase bucket does not exhibit structure , it is so much smaller in enclosed area than the @xmath36 that its total molecule number is smaller .",
    "the simulation results of fig .",
    "[ s3s1compare](c ) and the theory results of fig .",
    "[ s3s1compare](d ) support this description .",
    "figure  [ s3s1compare](c ) shows that , even at @xmath48 , the transverse loss rate per stage is at all times greater for @xmath29 than @xmath28 . however , the calculated longitudinal phase - space acceptance of fig .",
    "[ s3s1compare](d ) mirrors the behavior observed experimentally in fig .",
    "[ s3s1compare](b ) when the initial points are scaled to the experimental ratio of 2.75 .",
    "this scaling accounts for the aforementioned ` halo ' in the slowed @xmath29 packet , which persists relatively unchanged over the range of @xmath29 phase angles used ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the fact that the theory curves of fig .",
    "[ s3s1compare](d ) cross at a higher velocity than the data of fig .",
    "[ s3s1compare](b ) suggests there is increased transverse guiding of @xmath28 slowing at high phase angles .",
    "nevertheless , even with 142 stages of deceleration , @xmath28 is unfavorable for velocities below 224 m / s due to reduced stable phase - space area .    at this point",
    ", one would expect that operation at lower phase angles would permit realization of the gain produced by the @xmath28 method .",
    "this can be accomplished by naively using a longer decelerator . a simulation of this kind is presented in fig .",
    "[ s=3stagenumber ] , which plots the number of molecules present after deceleration at @xmath50 versus final velocity .",

    "the number next to a data point represents the number of deceleration stages used .",
    "initially the decelerated molecule number is relatively flat versus final velocity .",
    "however , after about 500 stages ( 180 m / s ) , the number of decelerated molecules begins to decrease and dramatically falls off after 550 stages ( 150 m / s ) .",
    "very few molecules survive below 100 m / s .",
    "this is because for @xmath37 the decelerated molecules must fly through an entire stage while experiencing a guiding force in only one dimension [ see fig .",
    "[ decelerationschemes](c ) ] .",
    "once the molecules are at slower speeds they can spread out in one transverse dimension or be over - focused in the other and collide with the rods . as the mean kinetic energy of the slowed packet becomes comparable to the full potential height",
    ", the packet can be nearly stopped as it traverses the intermediate charged stage .",
    "this has two consequences : ( 1 ) longer transit time leading to more intense transverse focusing ; and ( 2 ) velocity filtering of the low - speed packet as slower molecules are longitudinally reflected from this potential .",
    "the transverse loss responsible for the extreme drop in molecule number for @xmath37 deceleration also occurs in traditional deceleration , but to a lesser degree .",
    "because of this decrease in molecule number at low speeds , the usefulness of slowing with @xmath51 is generally limited to experiments that do not require the lowest velocities , such as microwave spectroscopy and collision experiments  @xcite .",
    "we note also that our simulations predict no low - velocity gain when using slowing sequences containing combinations of deceleration at @xmath29 and bunching at @xmath37 .",
    "a natural extension of the above overtone deceleration is the use of what we have termed a  modified decelerator overtone , \" denoted by an additional plus sign , i.e. , @xmath52 .",
    "deceleration in this manner is shown in fig .",
    "[ decelerationschemes](d ) for @xmath43 . in this method , deceleration proceeds similarly to conventional @xmath37 .",
    "however , @xmath53 sequences yield confinement of the packet in both transverse dimensions .",
    "this is achieved by charging all slower rods for the period in which the synchronous molecule is between switching stages . in order to minimally disrupt the longitudinal dynamics of the synchronous molecule , the second set of slower rods",
    "is charged only when the molecule is at the peak of the longitudinal potential from the first rod set .",
    "the packet then traverses two charged rod pairs before reaching the next switching stage , at which point the rod pair that was originally charged is grounded .",
    "while this does create a slight anti - bunching effect , i.e. , molecules in front of the synchronous molecule gain a small amount of energy , it provides an extra stage of transverse guidance in comparison to @xmath37 .",
    "experimental results of this method of slowing are shown in fig .",
    "[ s=3+loading ] for comparison to deceleration using both @xmath36 and @xmath37 . fig .",
    "[ s=3+loading](a ) displays a unique consequence of the @xmath53 switching sequence , where operation at @xmath54 = 0@xmath55 leads to deceleration .",
    "figure  [ s=3+loading](b ) shows that operation with @xmath52 provides slightly more molecules than @xmath51 , but the loss of molecules due to decreased longitudinal velocity acceptance remains a problem .",
    "the increase in molecule number for @xmath56 over @xmath37 is due to the extra stage of transverse guidance , which for the higher - velocity packets we measured leads to a larger transverse acceptance .    to determine whether the extra stage of transverse guidance would counter the overfocusing effects",
    ", we perform simulations of @xmath57 deceleration at @xmath54 = 20@xmath55 for a varying number of deceleration stages",
    ". the results of these simulations , shown in fig .",
    "[ s=3+number ] , are similar to the results for @xmath37 .",
    "namely , as the decelerator length is increased and the molecules speed is reduced , there is a marked molecule number loss for velocities below 200 m / s . in our simulations",
    ", we could not observe any molecules below 100 m / s .",
    "again , transverse overfocusing and longitudinal filtering of the molecular packet by the deceleration electrodes are responsible for large losses in the decelerator , and this suggests that measures beyond modified switching schemes are required to overcome these loss mechanisms .",
    "in addition to modifying the timing sequences of existing decelerators , it is possible , and perhaps preferable , to uncouple the longitudinal motion inside the stark decelerator from the transverse motion by redesigning the decelerator electrode geometry .",
    "one simple redesign , which we call the quadrupole - guiding decelerator ( qgd ) , is shown in fig .",
    "[ alternativesdschematic](a ) . in this decelerator , a quadrupole - guiding stage ( fig .",
    "[ alternativesdschematic](b ) ) is interleaved between each deceleration stage . while it may not be necessary to have a quadrupole - guiding stage between each deceleration stage ( especially in the beginning of the decelerator ) , it simplifies the analysis and will be used here .",
    "the switching of the electric fields inside a qgd is similar to a traditional decelerator operated with @xmath58 .",
    "figure  [ alternativesdschematic](c ) shows the potential energy experienced by a molecule decelerated at @xmath59 and is represented by a thick black curve . in this panel ,",
    "the quadrupole - guiding electrodes are omitted for clarity .",
    "note that the quadrupoles are always energized and their center coincides with the @xmath38 position , while @xmath60 occurs between the deceleration electrodes .",
    "deceleration with a qgd enjoys the same longitudinal phase - stability as a traditional decelerator . in a qgd , the maximum stable excursion position @xmath61 and velocity @xmath62 will differ from that of the traditional decelerator because the decelerating electrodes are most likely further apart . in other words , to prevent high - voltage breakdown , the quadrupole stages require the same inter - stage spacing as deceleration stages in a traditional decelerator .",
    "thus , the decelerating electrodes for a qgd will be twice as far apart as in our traditional decelerator , which possesses an inter - stage spacing of @xmath63 mm . since the dependence of the decelerating force on @xmath54 is less steep , the shape of the stable longitudinal phase space will change . understanding the shape of the stable longitudinal phase area is crucial for predicting the performance of the qgd , and",

    "the lack of structure inside these separatrices is evidence of the lack of coupling between the transverse and longitudinal modes . the right column , which shows simulated tof curves , reveals a single stable peak arriving at later times as @xmath54 is increased .",
    "these simulations are for a single @xmath64 state of oh and do not exhibit the large background contribution of the other states of oh present in experimental tof data .    from the comparison of the simulations with the analytical results represented by the separatrices",
    ", we see that the simple theory of eqs .",
    "[ qgdn2]-  [ qgdvmax ] is quite accurate in describing the longitudinal performance of the qgd .",
    "thus , by numerically integrating the area inside these separatrices , we can predict the longitudinal performance of the qgd relative to the traditional decelerator . as seen in fig .",
    "[ qgdps](a ) , the energy removed per stage of the qgd is less steep with @xmath54 because the decelerator stage spacing ( in this simulation ) is twice that of a traditional decelerator . for this reason",
    ", qgd deceleration with the same @xmath54 as in a traditional decelerator leads to a faster beam , given the same number of deceleration stages . when comparing the longitudinal acceptance of the two types of decelerators it is important to take the limit of high phase angles where both values of @xmath65 converge .",
    "nonetheless , the qgd shows significant gain over traditional deceleration as shown in fig .",
    "[ qgdps](b ) .",
    "this gain is primarily due to the increased physical size of the stable longitudinal phase space resulting from the larger deceleration stage spacing .",
    "it is important to note that since fig .",
    "[ qgdps ] compares only the total area inside the separatrix  and @xmath36 deceleration does not completely fill this area due to the coupling effects  this gain is actually an underestimate of the qgd longitudinal performance .",
    "furthermore , these graphs do not include transverse focusing effects , which can only be properly included through detailed simulation .",
    "the results of monte carlo simulations including these transverse effects are shown in fig .",
    "[ qgdsnloss ] .",
    "the number of decelerated molecules versus final speed is plotted for both the traditional decelerator operating at @xmath36 and the qgd operating at two different quadrupole rod voltages , @xmath77 kv and @xmath78 kv . while the qgd initially delivers more molecules , once the molecules are decelerated below 100 m / s , the decelerated molecule number falls off abruptly .",
    "this behavior is expected since , for these simulations , the voltage on the quadrupole - guiding stages is held constant throughout the slowing sequence . as detailed in eq .",
    "( 3 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , the focal length of a transverse guiding element is directly proportional to the molecular kinetic energy .",
    "therefore , as the mean speed of the packet is decreased , the molecules are overfocused and collide with the decelerator electrodes .",
    "this can be prevented by lowering the voltage on the quadrupole - guiding stages during the deceleration process .",
    "figure  [ loadingcurve ] displays simulation results of deceleration with this dynamically scaled voltage compared to @xmath29 slowing at @xmath54 = 30.43@xmath55 . for this simulation ,",
    "the quadrupole voltages are scaled by @xmath79 after each deceleration stage , where @xmath80 is the instantaneous packet velocity directly following each stage switch .",
    "the exponent of 0.875 is found empirically to produce the most gain at @xmath23 m / s .",
    "for ease of simulation , the transverse forces are scaled by @xmath79 whenever the molecules are closer to a quadrupole - guiding stage than to a deceleration stage .",
    "while this may be a poor approximation at the lowest speeds , it will likely lead to an underestimate of the decelerated molecule number since the transverse guidance of the quadrupole - guiding stage extends beyond this regime . even if it leads to an overestimate , proper control of the quadrupole voltages",
    "may compensate any overfocusing introduced by the decelerating elements . as seen in fig .",
    "[ loadingcurve ] , dynamically controlling the voltage of the quadrupole - guiding stages leads to a factor of 5 increase in decelerated number for larger velocities ( @xmath980 m / s ) and delivers about 40% more decelerated molecules than traditional @xmath29 deceleration provides at the lowest final speeds ( 14 m / s ) . because the voltages applied to the quadrupole - guiding stages are relatively low",
    ", dynamic control of them should be possible using an analog waveform generator and high - voltage amplifier .",
    "it should be noted that the optimal voltage scaling may vary among decelerators since the real focal length depends sensitively on the electrode construction , and at low speeds the transverse focusing of the decelerator electrodes becomes significant .",
    "this is , presumably , because the overfocusing of the decelerator electrodes can be compensated to a certain degree by injecting molecules which are already slightly overfocused . in other words , two focusing stages",
    "can overcome the overfocusing of a single stage .",
    "thus , it may be possible to use adaptive algorithms to optimize the quadrupole voltage or change the design of the decelerating electrodes so that they provide less transverse focusing , and maximize the number of decelerated molecules beyond what is reported here  @xcite .",
    "one important advantage of the qgd over traditional decelerators is its inherent ability to support more deceleration stages .",
    "because the molecules experience a tunable transverse focusing element after each deceleration stage , there is little loss in efficiency by extending the number of deceleration stages .",
    "in fact , as seen in fig .",
    "[ qgdsnloading ] , there is essentially no loss until the molecules are decelerated to the lowest speeds previously discussed .",
    "this low - velocity loss is due to the aforementioned transverse overfocusing and longitudinal reflection .",
    "the former loss mechanism may be overcome , while the latter presents a fundamental limit .",
    "even with this loss , the qgd outperforms both @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ s=3stagenumber ] ) and @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ s=3+number ] ) .",
    "thus , the qgd is an ideal decelerator for more efficiently producing cold molecules and , perhaps more importantly , the ideal decelerator for slowing molecules with poor stark shift to mass ratios , like h@xmath7o and so@xmath7 .",
    "in summary , we identify several loss mechanisms observed in the operation of stark decelerators and perform initial experiments and detailed monte carlo simulations to address them . while the use of decelerator overtones yields improvement over @xmath29 deceleration at high to intermediate speeds (",
    "@xmath81 m / s ) , the loss at very low velocities remains problematic .",
    "the qgd solves the problem of coupling between the transverse and longitudinal motions inside a stark decelerator by introducing independent transverse focusing elements . by dynamically",
    "controlling the focal length ( voltage ) of these guiding elements , large improvements ( factor of 5 ) in deceleration efficiency can be achieved for @xmath81 m / s , and gain of @xmath82 is predicted for the lowest velocities .",
    "furthermore , it appears that with dynamic control of the guiding stage focal length there should be no limit to the length of decelerator that can be built .",
    "this enables the deceleration of molecules with a poor stark shift to mass ratio .",
    "however , we note that none of the techniques described in this article mitigate the longitudinal low - velocity loss due to reflection , which appears to be a fundamental component of stark deceleration . building upon the strong correlation between simulation and experimental results , we are confident that the simulations presented in this work provide a solid guideline for future implementations of stark deceleration .",
