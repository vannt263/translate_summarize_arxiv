    "recent advancements in observational technology enable us to trace back the history of the universe . in particular , observations of the cosmic microwave background , including the latest results of the planck mission @xcite , provide us with the picture of the universe at the recombination , the subsequent evolution , and a piece of information on the early universe . the universe in a much earlier period , however , is still veiled and many models which are built to explain the physics beyond the energy scale realized in laboratories remain unverified . to select the theory describing our world , we need not only observational developments but also more precise theoretical predictions using fundamental theories of physics",
    ".    one of the most interesting phenomena in the early universe is the phase transition .",
    "it has provided mechanisms of inflation @xcite , called `` old inflation '' @xcite and `` new inflation '' @xcite . in both of the models inflation",
    "is driven by the vaccum energy before the end of the phase transition .",
    "the thermal inflation @xcite , also caused by the potential energy of the flaton field , is a relatively short accelerating period after the primordial inflation .",
    "since it changes the expansion history of the universe , not only the moduli and gravitinos are diluted but also the primordial gravitational waves are damped @xcite . on the other hand , collisions of bubbles generated during a phase transition can produce gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "furthermore , depending on the kinds of the broken symmetry , various topological defects are expected to be produced . among them , line - like topological defects known as cosmic strings can produce gravitational waves @xcite which may be detectable by future experiments @xcite .",
    "these examples indicate that the phase transition is a key to understand high - energy physics and the early universe",
    ".    precise description of the dynamics of phase transitions is necessary to compare predictions of each theoretical model with observations . in many models of the early universe ,",
    "phase transitions are controlled by the expectation value of the scalar fields .",
    "while the effective potential is a useful quantity to derive properties of the phase transitions that happen quasi - statically , its use often comes short because of dynamical nature of the scalar fields . in such cases ,",
    "we need to directly solve the evolution equations of the scalar fields derived from the effective action .",
    "it has been shown that the behavior of a scalar field in thermal bath can be described by the langevin equation @xcite , which includes stochastic noise terms coming from interactions with other fields in thermal bath .",
    "these noise terms may change the types of phase transitions .",
    "for example , a previous study @xcite indicates that the fermionic noise may lead to the phase mixing , which can not be described by the effective potential .",
    "so far , the effective action and the resultant equation of motion of a scalar field has been studied in models where it has self - interaction and interactions with other fermions and scalar bosons @xcite .",
    "now , it is an interesting project to extend the previous studies to include interactions with gauge fields .",
    "we extend previous analyses to include interactions with gauge fields using the simplest abelian gauge theory known as scalar quantum electrodynamics . though the hot scalar qed theory has been studied by ref .",
    "@xcite to study the dynamics of gauge fields , we focus on the scalar field as a system of interest and treat gauge fields as a hot environment .    the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we briefly review the effective action method and apply it to the scalar quantum electrodynamics in section ii .",
    "actually , this effective action contains the imaginary part . in section iii",
    ", we interpret it as stochastic noises and derive a generalized langevin equation .",
    "we consider the meaning of the equation , and explain the validity of this interpretation .",
    "we also show the stochastic property of the noise , and compare it with the fermionic and scalar bosonic noises which have been studied in previous studies .",
    "the dissipation rate of the each mode is also studied .",
    "we summarize our study and discuss its applicability in section iv .",
    "as we have mentioned in the inrtoduction , one of our goals is the precise description of phase transitions in gauge theory which requires our knowledge of effective action for scalar field . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the derivation of the effective action and investigation of basic properties of the obtained equation of motion for the massive charged scalar field due to interactions with gauge fields . in order to realize phase transition , we need to add self - interaction of the scalar field to have higgs mechanism .",
    "we defer the inclusion of the self - interaction to another study . the simplest approach to describe phase transitions in the hot early universe is to analyze a finite - temperature effective potential . by using the effective potential , we can explain the symmetry restoration at high temperature or in the early universe and the subsequent spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "however , since it is derived on the assumption of static , homogeneous field configuration , it can not describe the dynamics of phase transitions accurately . in this section , in order to obtain the equation of motion governing the dynamical phenomenon , we calculate the effective action .",
    "studies so far show that effective action generally contains the imaginary part , which can be interpreted as the origin of dissipative properties .      to clarify the role of gauge fields , we consider the scalar quantum electrodynamics , which is the simplest gauge theory .",
    "its lagrangian density is given by @xmath0    after imposing the coulomb gauge condition @xmath1 , one can see the lagrangian density becomes @xmath2 here , @xmath3 means the transverse components , which satisfy @xmath4 .",
