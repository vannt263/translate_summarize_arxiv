    "a boson was discovered at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "after almost all the run i data were analyzed , the measured properties of the new particle are best described by the standard - model ( sm ) higgs boson @xcite , which was proposed in 1960s @xcite .",
    "the most constrained is the gauge - higgs coupling @xmath10 , which is very close to the sm value @xcite . on the other hand , the relevant top- and bottom - yukawa couplings",
    "are not determined as precisely as @xmath11 by the current data .",
    "nevertheless , they are within @xmath12 of the sm values @xcite .    until now there is no information at all about the self - couplings of the higgs boson , which emerges from the inner dynamics of the higgs sector .",
    "for example , the trilinear couplings from the sm , two - higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) , and mssm are very different from one another .",
    "thus , investigations of the trilinear coupling will shed lights on the dynamics of the higgs sector .",
    "one of the best probes is higgs - boson - pair production at the lhc .",
    "there have been a large number of works of higgs - pair production in the sm @xcite , in model - independent fashion  @xcite , and in special models beyond the sm @xcite and in susy @xcite . in the sm",
    ", higgs - pair production receives contributions from two entangled sources , the triangle and box diagrams .",
    "the triangle diagram involves the higgs self - trilinear coupling and the top - yukawa coupling while the box diagram involves only the top - yukawa coupling . in order to probe the effects of the higgs trilinear coupling",
    ", we have to disentangle the triangle diagram from the box diagram .",
    "we anticipate that the triangle diagram , which contains an @xmath13-channel higgs propagator , does not increase as much as the box diagram as the center - of - mass energy @xmath14 increases .",
    "therefore , the box diagram tends to give more energetic higgs - boson pairs than the triangle diagram .",
    "thus , the opening angle in the decay products of each higgs boson can be used to isolate the triangle - diagram contribution .",
    "indeed , we found that the angular separation @xmath15 and @xmath16 between the decay products of the higgs - boson pair are very useful variables to disentangle the two sources .    here",
    "we also entertain the possibility of a dimension-5 operator @xmath2 , which can arise from a number of extended higgs models , including composite higgs models or some general 2hdm s .",
    "for example , in a general 2hdm we can have a diagram with a @xmath17 vertex and a @xmath18 vertex connected by the heavy @xmath19 .",
    "when the heavy @xmath19 is integrated out , we are left with the contact diagram @xmath20 .",
    "the anomalous @xmath2 coupling can contribute to higgs - pair production via a triangle diagram .",
    "this triangle diagram is similar to the triangle diagram with the trilinear higgs self coupling , except that it does not have the @xmath13-channel higgs propagator .",
    "we shall show that the new contact diagram will give terms that can be combined with the terms of the triangle diagram , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "we note that the kinematic behavior of the triangle diagram induced by the dim-5 @xmath2 contact interaction is different from that induced by the trilinear higgs self coupling , because of the absence of the higgs propagator in the contact diagram .    in this work ,",
    "we adopt the effective lagrangian approach , taking the liberty that the involved higgs - boson couplings can be varied freely within reasonable ranges .",
    "the relevant couplings considered in this work are ( i ) the top - quark yukawa coupling , ( ii ) the trilinear higgs self - coupling , and ( iii ) the contact - type @xmath2 coupling . in the top - quark yukawa and contact - type @xmath2 interactions ,",
    "we take into account the possibility of the simultaneous presence of the scalar and pseudoscalar couplings which can signal cp violation .",
    "the rationale behind the cp - odd part is that the current data , other than the edm constraints , can not restrict the cp - odd part .",
    "the edm constraints , however , depend on a number of assumptions and may therefore be weaken because of cancellation among various cp - violating sources @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath2 is a dimension-5 operator , which may originate from a genuine dim-6 operator , e.g. , @xmath21 after electroweak symmetry breaking , @xmath22 .",
    "this operator is thus suppressed only by two powers of higher scale , such that it can give a significant contribution at the lhc energies .",
    "our strategy is first to find a useful expression for higgs - boson pair production cross sections in terms of these couplings , see eq .",
    "( [ cdef ] ) .",
    "the coefficient of each term depends on the collider energy @xmath23 , higgs decay channels , experimental cuts , etc .",
    "thus , such an expression enables us to easily obtain the cross section under various experimental conditions for arbitrary values of the couplings . our aim is to extract the information on the higgs couplings , especially on the higgs self coupling by exploiting the expression .",
    "it is helpful to consider some experimental cuts which can isolate the contribution from the higgs self coupling and lead to various cross sections with different dependence on the higgs couplings . in this work ,",
    "specifically , we employ the @xmath24 decay mode of the higgs - boson pair and look into the angular separation between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 and that between the photons .",
    "it is shown that one can map out the possible regions of higgs couplings assuming certain values of measured cross sections , though it is channel dependent .",
    "thanks to the largest branching ratio of the higgs boson into @xmath25 , the angular separation between the bottom - quark pair is an useful tool in for most of the proposed channel at the lhc",
    ".    in summary , the current work marks a number of improvements over previous published works as listed in the following :    1 .",
    "we have included the cp - odd part in the top - yukawa coupling .",
    "the cp - even and cp - odd parts are constrained by an elliptical - like equation by the current higgs - boson data , as shown in fig .  4 of ref .",
    "note that the effects of the cp - odd part of the top - yukawa coupling at the lhc , ilc , and photon colliders were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , though we study the effects in depth for the lhc here .",
    "we have included the dim-5 anomalous @xmath2 contact coupling , as done in ref .",
    "furthermore , we also include the cp - odd part of this contact coupling . 3 .",
    "we have calculated an easy - to - use expression to obtain the cross sections as a function of the involved couplings at each center - of - mass energy .",
    "we also obtain similar expressions in various kinematic regions such that one can easily obtain the cross sections under the proposed experimental cuts for arbitrary values of the higgs couplings .",
    "4 .   with assumed uncertainties in the measurements of cross sections",
    ", we can map out the sensitivity regions of parameter space that can be probed at the lhc .",
    "the organization of the work is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the formalism for our exploratory approach and present an expression for the higgs - boson pair production cross section in terms of various combinations of the higgs couplings under consideration . in section iii",
    ", we examine the behavior of each term of the cross section versus energies . in section",
    "iv , employing the @xmath26 decay mode , we illustrate how to extract the information on the higgs couplings by exploiting the angular separations between the higgs decay products .",
    "there we also discuss the prospect for the 100 tev @xmath8 machine .",
    "we conclude in section v and offer a few comments with regard to our findings . in appendix",
    ", we compare the sm cross sections at 14 tev with those at 100 tev for the process @xmath27 and give some comments on the @xmath28 decay mode .",
    "higgs - boson pair production via gluon fusion goes through a triangle diagram with a higgs - boson propagator and also through a box diagram with colored particles running in it .",
    "the relevant couplings involved are top - yukawa and the higgs trilinear self coupling .",
    "we further explore the possibility of a dim-5 anomalous @xmath2 contact coupling @xcite .",
