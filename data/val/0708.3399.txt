    "this work concerns a new invariant of knot tunnels , called the _ depth_.",
    "it is based on the theory of knot tunnels developed in our earlier work @xcite , which provides a simplicial complex @xmath7 whose vertices correspond to the ( equivalence classes of ) tunnels of all tunnel number  @xmath0 knots .",
    "the depth invariant of a tunnel is defined to be the simplicial distance in the @xmath0-skeleton of @xmath7 from the vertex corresponding to the tunnel to the vertex corresponding to the unique tunnel of the trivial knot . in particular , the trivial tunnel is the only tunnel of depth  @xmath8 .",
    "a tunnel has depth  @xmath0 exactly when it is a @xmath9-tunnel of a @xmath9-knot .",
    "we denote the depth of a tunnel @xmath2 by @xmath1 .",
    "it is somewhat similar to the _",
    "@xmath10hempel@xmath11 distance _",
    "@xmath12 ( see j. johnson @xcite and y. minsky , y. moriah , and s. schleimer @xcite ) , but is very easy to calculate in terms of the parameter description of tunnels given in  @xcite .",
    "the two invariants are related by the inequality @xmath13 but the depth can be much larger than the distance . indeed , we will see that the regular tunnels of torus knots have distance  @xmath14 , but their depths can be arbitrarily large .",
    "the depth invariant has a geometric interpretation in terms of a construction that first appeared in a paper of h. goda , m. scharlemann , and a. thompson @xcite .",
    "their construction , which we call a giant step , takes a tunnel and produces a new tunnel ( usually of a different knot ) .",
    "they proved that every tunnel could be produced starting from the tunnel of the trivial knot and applying a sequence of giant steps , and we will see from the definitions that @xmath1 is the minimum length of a such a sequence . unlike the construction of a knot tunnel using cabling operations , developed in  @xcite and reviewed in section  [ sec : cabling ] below , the choice of giant steps is usually not unique , even when one restricts to minimal sequences . using the simplicial structure of @xmath7 , we will give an algorithm to calculate the number of distinct minimal sequences of giant steps that produce a given tunnel .",
    "in particular , this provides arbitrarily complicated examples of tunnels for which the minimal giant steps sequence _ is _ unique , while showing that such tunnels are sparse among the set of all tunnels .",
    "the algorithm is quite effective .",
    "we have implemented it computationally  @xcite to find the number of distinct minimal sequences producing a tunnel , given its parameter description from  @xcite .",
    "we next turn to an examination of the bridge number of a tunnel number  @xmath0 knot .",
    "the first main result , theorem  [ thm : bridge_numbers ] , gives a lower bound for the bridge number of a specific tunnel number  @xmath0 knot in terms of the parameters of a tunnel of the knot .",
    "the algorithm to compute that bound is easy , and we have implemented it computationally  @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : bridge_numbers ] is quite easy for us since the necessary ideas and hard geometric work were already developed by goda , scharlemann , and thompson @xcite and scharlemann and thompson @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ thm : bridge_numbers ] , together with a geometric construction involving the cabling construction of tunnels from  @xcite , gives a general and sharp lower bound for the bridge number in terms of the depth of a tunnel :    for @xmath15 , the minimum bridge number of a knot having a tunnel of depth  @xmath3 is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 for @xmath20 .    as a matrix ,",
    "the recursion in theorem  [ thm : minbridgenum ] is @xmath21 the eigenvalues of this matrix are @xmath22 , showing that the asymptotic growth rate of the bridge numbers of any sequence of tunnel number  @xmath0 knots as a function of depth is at least a constant multiple of @xmath4 .",
    "this improves lemma  2 of @xcite , which is that bridge number grows linearly with distance . since each of the giant steps of a minimal sequence increases the depth by  @xmath0 , corollary  [ coro : bridge_numbers ] also improves proposition  1.11 of @xcite , which implies that bridge number grows asymptotically at least as fast as  @xmath23 .",
    "of course , the minimum bridge number theorem also shows that the bound for growth rate of @xmath4 is best possible , indeed its proof tells exactly how to construct a tunnel of depth  @xmath3 having bridge number  @xmath16 .",
    "we will show that this growth rate is also achieved by a sequence of torus knot tunnels ( each obtained by applying a cabling operation to the previous one ) given in section  [ sec : torus_knots ] .",
    "in fact , the bridge numbers of the knots of that sequence are given by the recursion in the minimum bridge number theorem , except that one starts with @xmath17 and @xmath24 .",
    "the terms @xmath16 are then the minimal bridge numbers of any torus knot having a tunnel of the corresponding depth .",
    "besides the specific examples of torus knot tunnels we have already mentioned , we give a general algorithm to compute the slope parameters for the regular tunnel ( sometimes called the `` short '' tunnel ) of a @xmath25 torus knot .",
    "the algorithm uses the continued fraction expansion of @xmath26 .",
    "it is very effective and has been implemented computationally  @xcite .",
    "a more general version of the geometric construction used in proving the minimum bridge number theorem allows us to show that in general , cabling operations can be carried out rather efficiently with respect to bridge number .",
    "this leads to various upper bounds for the bridge number of a knot in terms of its tunnels .",
    "in particular ,    let @xmath27 be the fibonacci sequence .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is a regular tunnel produced by @xmath5 cabling operations , of which the first @xmath28 produce semisimple tunnels .",
    "then @xmath29 .    for fixed @xmath5 , the largest value for",
    "the upper bound in theorem  [ thm : ub ] occurs when @xmath30 , and we show that it is sharp for this case :    the maximum bridge number of any tunnel number @xmath0-knot having a tunnel produced by @xmath5 cabling operations is @xmath31 .",
    "here is an outline of the sections of the paper .",
    "the first three sections constitute a concise review of material from  @xcite that we will need for the present applications .",
    "section  [ sec : ddd ] introduces the distance and depth invariants , and gives a few results that follow quickly from  @xcite and work of other authors .",
    "the main applications of the paper may be then read independently .",
    "the giant steps discussed above are introduced in section  [ sec : gst_moves ] , and the analysis of minimal sequences of giant steps is carried out in section  [ sec : gst_move_seqs ] .",
    "lower bounds for bridge number , in particular the minimum bridge number theorem , are given in section  [ sec : bridge_number_growth ] , while section  [ sec : bridgenum_conj ] has the results on upper bounds .",
    "the torus knot examples are worked out in section  [ sec : torus_knots ] .",
    "the final section of the paper reviews how the general theory can be adapted to include tunnel number  @xmath0 links , and indicates how the applications in the present paper extend to that case .",

    "each @xmath0-simplex of @xmath35 is a face of countably many @xmath14-simplices .",
    "as suggested by figure  [ fig : subdivision ] , @xmath35 grows outward from any of its @xmath14-simplices in a treelike way .",

    "an isotopy carrying this handlebody to @xmath33 carries a cocore @xmath14-disk of that @xmath0-handle to a nonseparating disk in @xmath33 , and carries the tunnel number  @xmath0 knot to a core circle of the solid torus obtained by cutting @xmath33 along the image disk in @xmath33 .",
    "the indeterminacy of this isotopy is the group of isotopy classes of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of @xmath34 that preserve @xmath33 .",
