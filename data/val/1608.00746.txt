    "hot jupiters were the first type of extrasolar planet to be discovered , for both the radial velocity and transit methods @xcite , their detection being aided by their comparatively large radii and short orbital periods .",
    "they were also the first extrasolar planets whose atmospheres were detected @xcite , helped by their often - large atmospheric scale heights .",
    "at this point , approximately 30 transiting hot jupiters have been studied using the method of transmission spectroscopy , where opacity in the planetary atmosphere is probed by measuring the size of the planet as a function of wavelength ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such analyses can also be performed using transmission photometry , where wavelength resolution is achieved by using multiple passbands rather than via a spectroscopic approach ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". versus transmission spectroscopy , the method of transmission photometry typically requires more observing time and has a lower wavelength resolution , but can be performed on smaller telescopes and is less subject to systematic errors due to earth s atmosphere and instrumental effects @xcite .",
    "rayleigh scattering has so far been detected in four transiting hot jupiters using transmission photometry : gj3470b @xcite , wasp-103 b ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paperi ) , and tentatively in gj1214b @xcite and qatar-2b @xcite .",
    "the wasp-103 system ( * ? ? ? * hereafter g14 ) stands out in this list as having the hottest star , the largest planet , and a highly significant detection of the rayleigh scattering signal ( 7.3@xmath4 ) which is , however , much stronger than expected . adopting the massspec concept from @xcite leads to a measurement of the planetary mass which is a factor of five smaller than the dynamical mass measurement ( paperi ) . since this work",
    ", a faint and cool nearby star has been detected with a very small sky - projected separation from the wasp-103 system @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the current work is to revisit the analysis of wasp-103 to determine the effect of the presence of this faint companion star on the measured properties of the system , and see if it can provide an explanation for the anomalous transmission spectrum of the planet .",
    "the presence of a faint nearby star has previously been shown to affect both transmission @xcite and emission @xcite spectroscopy .",
    "in paperi we presented light curves of 11 transits of wasp-103 obtained using three telescopes and seven optical passbands .",
    "eight transits were observed using the 1.54 m danish telescope at eso la silla , seven through a bessell @xmath5 filter and one through a bessell @xmath6 filter .",
    "two transits were observed in four passbands simultaneously ( similar to the gunn @xmath7 bands ) using the grond imager @xcite on the mpg 2.2 m at the same site . the final transit was observed using the 2.15 m telescope at casleo , argentina , and will not be considered further in this work because of its significantly greater scatter and more complex continuum normalisation ( paperi ) .

    "coloured and filled circles show the results from this study , and the passbands are labelled at the top of the figure .",

    "measured planetary radius ( @xmath8 ) as a function of wavelength compared to the predictions from theoretical models of planetary atmospheres .",
    "filled circles show the results from this study , and the passbands are labelled at the top of the figure .",
    "transmission spectra are shown using grey lines and are for a planet without tio ( dark grey smooth line ) and with tio ( light grey jagged line ) .",
    "both spectra have been scaled to match the surface gravity of the planet and subsequently offset to appear approximately in the centre of the plot . ]    following the approach of @xcite , we modelled the light curves of wasp-103 with the geometrical properties fixed to their best - fitting value from table[tab : lcfit ] . the fractional radius of the planet and the linear ld coefficients were retained as fitted parameters , and the contaminating light was included as in section[sec : lc ] .",
    "the data for each passband were fitted individually , and the true radius of the planet in that band found by multiplying @xmath10 by the best - fitting value of @xmath11 ( @xmath12@xmath13 ) neglecting its uncertainty .",
    "this process yielded measurements of the radius of the planet in different passbands , calculated in a consistent way and ignoring sources of error common to all passbands ( e.g.  the uncertainty in @xmath11 ) .",
    "the results can be found in table[tab : rb ] along with the characteristics of the filters used for the observations .",
    "fig.[fig : rvary ] shows the measured planetary radius as a function of wavelength .",
    "the results from paperi are also shown for comparison .",
    "significant differences are seen in all passbands except the @xmath14-band .",
    "it is clear that the inclusion of the faint star in the analysis changes the interpretation of the optical transmission spectrum of wasp-103b , primarily by weakening the variation of radius with wavelength .    in fig.[fig : nikku ] we compare the radius measurements of wasp-103b to two representative theoretical transmission spectra .",
    "the spectra are for planets with and without titanium oxide @xcite and were kindly calculated by nikku madhusudhan ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "they have been scaled to the surface gravity and temperature of wasp-103b , and then arbitrarily offset to appear near the centre of the plot .",
    "it is clear that neither match the observations well , and in particular predict a rise in radius near the centre of the plot whereas the observations themselves show the opposite .",
    "the same conclusion is reached when considering alternative sets of model transmission spectra @xcite .",
    "variation of planet radius with wavelength in si units ( filled circles ) and the slope @xmath15 determined from the data ( unbroken line ) . for comparison the values from paperi are shown with grey open circles and a grey dotted line . ]",
    "the massspec concept @xcite is that it is possible to measure the mass of a planet from its transmission spectrum .",
    "it depends on obtaining the atmospheric scale height , @xmath16 , from the power - law variation of planet radius with wavelength : @xmath17 where @xmath18 for rayleigh scattering @xcite and can take other values for different scattering processes .",
    "the atmospheric scale height depends on surface gravity and therefore the mass of the planet : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the local temperature , @xmath21 is the mean molecular weight of the atmosphere ( assumed to be 2.3a.m.u .  for gas giants ) , g is the newtonian gravitational constant and @xmath22 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "we recast this equation to include all measurable terms on the left and all quantities which might be sought on the right ( contrast with eq.4 in paperi ) : @xmath23    in paperi we used this approach to infer a mass of @xmath24@xmath25  for the planet , with a significance of @xmath26 , which was much lower than the dynamically - measured value ( table[tab : model ] ) .",
    "our new analysis returns a higher mass of @xmath27@xmath25 , with the variation of radius with wavelength ( @xmath15 ) measured to a lower significance level of @xmath28 based on a simple monte carlo propagation of the uncertainties ( see fig.[fig : massspec ] ) . in both cases",
    "we have adopted @xmath29 , @xmath18 and @xmath30 .",
    "this mass is still far too low to match the value found from the analysis in section[sec : absdim ] .",
    "however , it is possible to adjust any of the quantities on the right - hand side of eq.[eq : big ] to match the measured value of the left - hand side .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to seek the value of @xmath31 where the planet mass from massspec equals the dynamical measurement ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "by manual iteration we found @xmath32 , and therefore @xmath33 when using @xmath30 , which is extremely high .",
    "alternatively , a value for the mean molecular weight of @xmath34a.m.u . would balance the equation but is unphysically small .",
    "we therefore conclude that the slope of radius versus wavelength measured for wasp-103b remains too large to be explained by rayleigh scattering , as expressed in the massspec paradigm .",
    "@xcite did not attempt to characterise the companion , or assess the chance that it is bound to the planetary system .",
    "we therefore now estimate its mass , the probability that it is a foreground or background star , and the probability that it is physically bound given the binary frequency in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the only observed quantities available for the nearby companion star are its sky position and magnitude differences in the @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath16 and @xmath38 filters versus the planet host star .",
    "these magnitude differences were found to correspond to @xmath39k in section[sec : lc ] .",
    "using the temperature  mass calibration presented by @xcite we find a mass of @xmath40@xmath1 , where the errorbars include an astrophysical scatter of 0.08dex in @xmath41 added in quadrature to the error arising from the uncertainty in @xmath42 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the value of @xmath43@xmath1  derived by @xcite .",
    "the companion star is therefore probably a mid - to - late k dwarf .",
    "the probability that the two stars form an asterism was calculated as follows .",
    "we used the trilegal galactic model @xcite to produce a synthetic population of stars for a @xmath44 field centred on wasp-103 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "stars were simulated to a depth of @xmath46 , and the default parameters for version 1.6 of the model were used ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the 2mass catalogue @xcite does not resolve the two stars , giving a combined value of @xmath47 , which we assume includes all light from both wasp-103a and the companion .",
    "@xcite measured a @xmath38 magnitude difference of @xmath48 , from which we calculate apparent magnitudes @xmath49 for wasp-103 and @xmath50 for the companion .",
    "we note that @xcite also calculated the apparent magnitudes and colours for their detected companions based on 2mass data , but under the assumption that the 2mass magnitude represents flux from only the planet - host star . in the case of wasp-103",
    "this assumption is not valid , because the companion is completely unresolved in the 2mass data and contributes @xmath51 of the total flux .",
    "we binned our synthetic population by @xmath38 magnitude , weighted the bins by the probability of the companion having the corresponding @xmath38 magnitude , and then summed over all bins to determine the density of stars with the companion s magnitude .",
    "the weighted stellar density was then multiplied by the sky area contained by a circle with radius @xmath52 , to give a probability of @xmath53 that a star of this @xmath38 magnitude is present within @xmath52 of the planet host star .",
    "we then checked the probability that the companion star is physically bound to wasp-103 . to compare this hypothesis to the unbound scenario , we determined the fraction of stellar systems we would expect to have the measured magnitude difference and projected separation using a monte carlo simulation .",
    "we adopted the binary population model used in @xcite , which utilises the population data from @xcite .",
    "46% of stars were assumed to be in binaries , period ( in days ) was log - normally distributed with a mean of 5.03 and a standard deviation of 2.28 , eccentricity was uniformly distributed in the interval [ 0.0,0.95 ] , and the mass ratio followed a three - part parameterisation to represent the high frequency of mass ratios near @xmath54 and low fraction of binaries with extreme mass ratios .",
    "all other orbital elements were randomised , including the phase at the time of observation .",
    "projected separations were calculated assuming a distance of @xmath55pc ( g14 ) , and the magnitude difference determined from the models of @xcite , with @xmath56}}= 0.06 $ ] and an age of 3.6gyr .",
    "the simulated stars were then weighted based on how closely they matched the measured magnitude difference of the companion , from which we determined that the probability of a star similar to wasp-103 having a matching stellar companion within @xmath52 is @xmath57 .",
    "this is five orders of magnitude more likely than the background star scenario , even though the inclusion of a constraint on mass ratio makes the probability conservatively low , so we conclude that the faint companion forms a part of the wasp-103 system .    assuming the angular separation and distance to the system as above , the projected separation of the two stars is @xmath58au .",
    "its orbital period is therefore of order 1000yr , so is far too long for confirmation via spectroscopic radial velocity measurements .",
    "additional flux ratios covering a wider wavelength range will , however , allow us to pin down its @xmath59  and therefore mass and radius much more precisely .",
    "isochrone from @xcite for an age of 3.6gyr and @xmath56}}= 0.06 $ ] compared to the @xmath60 colour and @xmath38-band absolute magnitude of the two stars .",
    "the isochrone is plotted with a green dotted line and labelled with the initial stellar mass at appropriate intervals .",
    "the properties of the two stars are shown with thick blue lines . ]    in fig.[fig : iso ] we plot the absolute magnitudes of the two stars against the theoretical isochrone from @xcite for an age of 3.6gyr and @xmath56}}= 0.06 $ ] .",
    "the position of the planet host star is in excellent agreement with its measured mass , confirming the correctness of the distance measurement given by g14 .",
    "the @xmath38-band magnitude difference suggests a mass of around 0.7@xmath1  for the secondary star , in agreement with @xcite despite the use of different synthetic spectra ( atlas9 versus phoenix ) and theoretical evolutionary models ( @xcite versus @xcite ) .",
    "the wasp-103 planetary system is an important tracer of the atmospheric properties of very hot planets , as its short orbital period and hot host star lead to a high equilibrium temperature of @xmath61k .",
    "this is even hotter than that for wasp-121b @xcite , which has very recently been found to have titanium oxide and vanadium oxide absorption in its atmosphere based on spectroscopy from the hubble space telescope @xcite , although we note that thermal inversions can arise due to other chemical species @xcite . the first work to probe the atmosphere of wasp-103b ( paperi ) found that the radius of the planet  as measured by transit depth",
    " was greater at bluer optical wavelengths .",
    "the significance level of this detection was strong at @xmath26 , but the slope was much greater than expected from rayleigh scattering and therefore its physical interpretation was not clear .    the subsequent detection of a faint nearby star @xcite offered the possibility of removing the discrepancy , by explaining the radius variation as a result of light from a faint and red object contaminating the light curves of wasp-103 , rather than an intrinsic property of the planetary system .",
    "we have therefore used @xmath37- and @xmath62-band magnitude differences between the planet host and the nearby star , recently presented by @xcite , to determine the amount of contaminating light as a function of passband , apply the corrections in a reanalysis of the transit light curves , and rederive the properties of the system plus the optical transmission spectrum of the planet .",
    "the effect of the inclusion of contaminating light is significant on some the photometric parameters , in particular the ratio of the radii , which has increased by 2.9@xmath4 .",
    "this quantity is typically the best - determined of the photometric parameters because it depends directly on the transit depth and is only weakly correlated with other parameters .",
    "it is also generally found to be the quantity which exhibits the worst agreement between different datasts ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we have usually ascribed this issue to the very fact that the ratio of the radii is the best - determined photometric parameter , so therefore is the parameter which is most sensitive to the existence of red noise in transit light curves .",
    "it is also clear that some of this discord can be attributed to the variation of opacity with wavelength , which is the underlying physical process probed using transmission spectroscopy and photometry .",
    "however , it is likely that some is due to flux contributions arising from undetected faint nearby stars , in which case the scatter in the ratio of the radii is not intrinsic to many of the planetary systems which have been studied in the past .",
    "the effect of the inclusion of contaminating light on the measured physical properties , however , is somewhat smaller .",
    "the main changes for the wasp-103 system are that the measured planet radius increases by 0.6@xmath4 and the density decreases by 0.8@xmath4 .",
    "this is encouraging in that our understanding of the general planet population is not greatly affected by the presence of undetected close companions ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "such a statement is not valid in general , however , as light curves in redder bands are more affected in the typical scenario whereby the faint star is redder than the planet host star .",
    "whilst there are many advantages in observing at redder optical wavelengths , such as weaker stellar limb darkening and starspot perturbations , it is better to observe in bluer passbands if contaminating light from a redder star is an issue",
    ". this will be an important consideration for the tess mission @xcite , which has a very coarse pixel scale and a passband which cuts on at 600 nm in order to minimise the chromatic aberrations present in refractive optics .",
    "the impact of the contaminating light on the transmission spectrum of the planet is much more important . instead of a relatively featureless slope throught the optical wavelength range",
    ", there is now an upward inflection redward of 760 nm .",
    "this is not reproduced by existing theoretical models of planetary transmission spectra , which tend to predict the opposite : larger radii in the middle of the optical band due to broad absorption from either atomic sodium and potassium , or titanium oxide .",
    "an explanation of the transmission spectrum of wasp-103b demands strong absorption from species at both bluer and redder wavelengths .",
    "the massspec concept was invoked to explore possible explanations of the transmission spectrum of wasp-103b .",
    "we note that this is not strictly applicable , because the spectrum does not exhibit a monotonic slope through the optical wavelength range and therefore is not consistent with purely scattering processes .",
    "the spectral slope is much weaker once the contaminating light has been included in the analysis , and is also more uncertain due to the large errorbars in the measurements of the contaminating light .",
    "the slope now has a significance of @xmath28 , and corresponds to a planet mass of @xmath27@xmath25  which is still much smaller than the dynamically - measured value of @xmath63@xmath25 .",
    "the magnitude differences @xmath64 and @xmath65 between the companion and the planet host star are consistent with the companion having a temperature of @xmath39k and thus a mass of @xmath40@xmath1 .",
    "the probability of the two stars being aligned by chance is very low , @xmath53 , so they are almost certainly gravitationally bound .",
    "wasp-103 is therefore a hierarchical system consisting of ( at least ) two stars and one planet .",
    "it is clear that our understanding of the wasp-103 system remains incomplete .",
    "a major improvement could be obtained from more precise characterisation of the flux ratio between the planet host and the faint nearby star .",
    "the available flux ratios are either extremely uncertain @xcite or require extrapolation from near - infrared to optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "additional observations should be obtained at optical wavelengths using adaptive optics on a large telescope , which can be capable of much greater resolution than a lucky imager on a 2.2 m telescope .",
    "it is entirely possible that such observations will cause a further revision to the measured transmission spectrum of wasp-103b .",
    "finally , the wasp-103 system is now known to be another example of a planet in a stellar binary system .",
    "it is therefore an important tracer of the formation mechanisms of binary and planetary systems @xcite .",
