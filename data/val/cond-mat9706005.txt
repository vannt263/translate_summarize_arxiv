    "macromolecular surface interactions play an important role in a variety of phenomena : stabilization / destabilization of colloidal solutions @xcite , where the `` surface '' is the surface of a colloidal particle ; surface effects in liquid crystal displays @xcite , where the `` surface '' is the walls of the container ; and modification of bending rigidities of bilayers @xcite , in which case the `` surface '' is a membrane .",
    "both rigid and flexible macromolecules can induce a modification of the properties of interfaces , either by adsorption or depletion ; here we concentrate on the surface physics of non - adsorbing , rigid and rod - shaped macromolecules .",
    "interest in solutions of rigid rod - like objects can be traced to the work of stanley who first extracted the tobacco mosaic virus ( tmv )  @xcite and to the subsequent observation of the nematic phase in tmv solutions  @xcite , which was later explained by the seminal theory of onsager  @xcite .",
    "many other rod - like molecules exist in the biological realm , ranging from dna in its @xmath0-helix form @xcite to fibrils of amyloid @xmath1-protein , the molecular agent at the origin of the alzheimer disease @xcite .",
    "solutions of rod - like molecules in a large variety of mineral and organic systems have also been studied  @xcite .    in a pioneering study of _ surface _ interactions of macromolecules asakura and oosawa  @xcite showed that the steric depletion of rigid macromolecules at a flat surface increases the interfacial energy of the system , implying that two surfaces in a solution of non - interacting rods will attract one another when they are at separations smaller than the rod - length .",
    "this effect , which is at the origin of colloidal destabilization , is also present in the steric depletion of spherical particles , or particles with other shapes  but with a different range and magnitude .",
    "asakura and oosawa theory has since been extended to include effects of nematic ordering in the bulk  @xcite or effects of rod - rod excluded volume interactions  @xcite ; in the latter work the authors show that when the modification of the rod - rod excluded volume interactions close to the surface is taken into account , a rod solution may _ stabilize _ a colloidal suspension , rather than destabilizing it .",
    "however , almost all the available studies on rod - surface interactions are devoted to flat geometries , except for auvray s work  @xcite where the author makes a first attempt at considering curved geometries ; we use some of his constructions in our work , which extends the original asakura and oosawa theory to include effects of surface curvature in the contribution of the rod depletion layer to the surface tension . for flexible surfaces , e.g. membranes , in rod solutions ,",
    "our results allow us to derive the renormalization of the bending rigidities of the membrane .",
    "some of our findings are qualitatively different from the corresponding results for flexible polymers in solution .",
    "this prompted us to consider two rigid rod - segments joined in the middle as a first step in studying the cross - over from rigid rods to flexible polymers  rigid rods being a polymer of which the persistence length is longer than its length , and the rod - segments joined in the middle being one with a persistence length equal to half of its length .",
    "not surprisingly we find that when one allows for a hinge in the rod , the results are closer to the flexible polymer results .",
    "even though steric effects are purely entropic and exist for any non - adsorbing macromolecular solution , the strength of the effects is larger for rods with large aspect ratios .",
    "the following simple comparison of the order of magnitudes of the contributions to the surface tension with those caused by spherical particles illustrates this .",
    "the typical scale of the energy density in a solution of colloidal spheres of radius @xmath2 and particle number density @xmath3 is @xmath4 .",
    "integration over the layer thickness results in corrections to the interfacial energy of the order of @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the scale for the interfacial tension in most liquids is of the order of @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a microscopic size .",
    "for instance for @xmath8 nm , @xmath9 is of the order of tens of mn / m .",
    "the depletion of spherical particles , even at order unity volume fractions @xmath10 , induces thus corrections to the interfacial tension which are a factor @xmath11 lower than typical values .",
    "curvature corrections to the interfacial energy are of the form : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the radius of curvature and @xmath14 are two numerical constants .",
    "this sets the order of magnitude of modifications of the bare elastic constants : @xmath15 . even at the upper concentration limit @xmath16 , these corrections are at the lower end of the range@xcite , @xmath17 , of most bare elastic constants . for an isotropic rod solution",
    "the upper concentration limit is the onsager concentration @xmath18 @xcite , where @xmath19 is the length of the rod and @xmath20 its diameter .",
    "now interfacial tension contributions are of the order @xmath21 , but even for rod diameters of order of the microscopic length @xmath7 , and at the onsager concentration this contribution is still a factor ( @xmath22 ) smaller than typical interfacial tension values .",
    "however , modifications of the elastic constants are here of order @xmath23 . at the onsager concentration",
    "this is a factor @xmath24 larger than @xmath25 , and therefore , may lead to a substantial modification of the elastic constants of even rather rigid phospholipid membranes with elastic constants as large as @xmath26 , even at low rod concentrations where rod - rod interactions are negligible .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the basic thermodynamics necessary for our discussion ; sections  [ sec : onesurface ] and  [ sec : twosurface ] contain our results for rods close to surfaces , and rods in shells , respectively .",
    "we make an initial attempt at understanding the cross - over from flexible polymers to rigid rods in section  [ sec : segmented ] ; the last section is devoted to a discussion and summary of our main results .",
    "we consider an ideal gas of rods of length @xmath19 in the presence of surfaces which repel the rods , in several different geometries . the thickness of the rods is taken to be zero , i.e. much smaller than all other length scales in the problem .",
    "we parametrize the possible rod configurations by the coordinate @xmath27 , and two angles specifying in which direction the rod points , @xmath28 .",
    "kinetics is ignored throughout the treatment . ] .",
    "the relevant potential describing the thermodynamics of the system can be written as , ( @xmath29 ) : @xmath30 = \\int d\\,{\\vec{r } } \\int d\\ , { \\vec{\\omega } } \\,\\rho({\\vec{r } } , { \\vec{\\omega } } ) \\left[\\log(v \\ , \\rho({\\vec{r } } , { \\vec{\\omega}})/e ) - ( \\mu_b - u_{ext } ( { \\vec{r } } , { \\vec{\\omega } } ) ) \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is some normalization volume , @xmath32 is the solution chemical potential , and @xmath33 is the hard wall interaction potential that is either infinite or zero , depending on whether the configuration of the rod is allowed by the ` hard wall ' requirement or not .",
    "functional minimization of @xmath34 with respect to @xmath35 gives the equilibrium density profile : @xmath36 with @xmath3 the rod number density of the bulk solution .",
    "the local , position dependent , number density of particles @xmath37 is simply the sum over all allowed angular configurations of @xmath38 .",
    "the excess surface energy is then calculated as follows : @xmath39 -\\omega\\left[\\rho_b/(4 \\pi)\\right]\\over s } = \\rho_b   \\int { d\\vec{r}\\over{s}}\\;\\int { d\\vec{\\omega}\\over{4\\pi}}(1- e^{-u_{ext } ( { \\vec{r } } , { \\vec{\\omega } } ) } ) \\label{delgam}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the surface area and the volume integral runs over the space available to the solution .",
    "here we consider surfaces with rods on one side only .",
    "results for the case with rods on both sides can be easily found by adding the results for the inside and the outside .",
    "our calculations ignore fringe effects that are unimportant in the thermodynamic limit , e.g. the flat wall is treated as translationally invariant .",
    "we first rewrite equation ( [ delgam ] ) in pressure units ( @xmath41 ) and explicitly state its rod - length dependence @xmath42if we represent the space coordinates of the rod by the position of one extremity ( see figure  ( [ figendcoord ] ) ) , the function @xmath43 is unity when a rod of length @xmath19 , starting at @xmath44 and pointing in the direction @xmath45 intersects the surface ; it is 0 otherwise .",
    "this can be written as @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the usual step function @xmath48 and @xmath49 is defined as follows : the half - ray orginating at @xmath44 and travelling in the direction of @xmath50 may or may not intersect the surface . if it does not then we do not have to define @xmath49 , since all such configurations give @xmath51 , and thus do not affect any of the below expressions . if the half - ray does intersect the surface , we define @xmath49 as the intersection point that is closest to @xmath44 .",
    "notice that @xmath49 is independent of @xmath19 .",
    "it is convenient to calculate the @xmath19-derivative of the excess surface energy : @xmath52with @xmath53 the angle between the rod and the normal to the surface at point @xmath49 and @xmath54 a function restraining the angular integration space for a rod with one extremity at @xmath49 .",
    "the integral over @xmath55 ranges over the whole surface .",
    "the factor @xmath56 is the appropriate jacobian .      for any surface delimiting a convex body",
    ", the function @xmath57 restricts the angular integral to half of the angular space , independently of the actual surface shape .",
    "@xmath58integrating equation ( [ delgamcon ] ) with the boundary condition @xmath59 one gets the three dimensional result for the surface tension of convex bodies immersed in a rod solution : @xmath60this result can easily be extended to convex bodies in an arbitrary dimension @xmath61 : @xmath62with @xmath63 in particular , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "for a general surface , the function @xmath66 might restrict the angular integration in equation ( [ delgamgen2 ] ) to less than half of the angular space . in this case",
    "we can still integrate over half of the angular space and further subtract the non - available angular sector . in three dimensions : @xmath67where @xmath68 is another surface vector . differentiating with respect to @xmath19 and performing",
    "the angular integration leads to @xmath69the vector @xmath70 defines all the points on the surface at a distance @xmath19 from a given point @xmath71 . in this three dimensional case",
    "this is usually a one dimensional curve .",
    "the angle @xmath53 is measured with respect to the normal of the surface at point @xmath71 and the angle @xmath72 is measured with respect to the surface normal at point @xmath70 .",
    "contrary to the convex case , the excess surface energy of a non - convex body immersed in a rod solution does depend on the actual shape of the body .",
    "moreover , because the contribution of the second order derivative ( [ ddelgamlres ] ) is always negative , any long - wavelength concavity will _ reduce _ the surface tension of a surface with rods on one side or both sides .",
    "therefore entropic effects in such systems will render flat surfaces unstable towards long - wavelength curvature !",
    "it also implies that for a _ fixed geometry _ the surface tension is a concave function of the rod - length , @xmath19 , and will have the general form depicted in figure  ( [ figgamgen ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ ddelgamlres ] ) can easily be extended to spaces of different dimensions .",
    "for instance , in two dimensions , where the `` surface '' is actually a one dimensional curve of perimeter @xmath73 , one has @xmath74the sum runs over all ( usually two ) points @xmath75 at a distance @xmath19 from a given point @xmath76 on the surface .      with the above methods , @xmath77 can be calculated exactly for the inside and outside of a circle , a sphere , and a cylinder , each with radius @xmath13 ; and also for two flat walls separated by @xmath78 , i.e. a gap .",
    "we would like to emphasize that _ all _ of these results can also be derived in an independent way which is also exact , namely by `` counting beans '' , i.e. by just doing the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ delgamgen1 ] ) straightforwardly ( see section [ sec : comments ] below ) .",
    "we have explicitly checked that all of the results quoted here agree with these straightforward calculations  especially in the cylinder s case both calculations are quite involved algebraically , and this check is absolutely non - trivial .",
    "of course , the method of computing the second derivative and then integrating up is the shortest route to these answers .",
    "we now define @xmath79 ; this is for convenience only and does not mean that we take @xmath80 to be small unless specifically stated .",
    "we first calculate results for two dimensions .",
    "inside of a circle we have , ( see figure  ( [ figcircle ] ) ) : @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and the sum over @xmath83 amounts to a factor of two .",
    "thus : @xmath84using @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , we find : @xmath87 for three dimensions we consider rods inside spheres and cylinders .",
    "inside of a sphere we have , ( see figure  ( [ figsphere ] ) ) : @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "thus : @xmath91it follows that : @xmath92the calculation for the inside of a cylinder is a bit tedious , but also doable .",
    "we find : @xmath93 -        \\left(1+{{\\epsilon^2}\\over 8}\\right )      k\\left[{{\\epsilon^2}\\over 4}\\right ] \\right ] \\label{cylinder}\\]]where the functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the complete elliptic integral of the first and second kind respectively .",
    "the cylinder result can in principle be integrated to give the special functions meijerg .",
    "the straight - forward `` bean - counting '' mentioned above leads also to an integral form that can only be done explicitly as a perturbation series in @xmath80 .",
    "we checked that the coefficients in this series agree with the expression for the second derivative in eq .",
    "( [ cylinder ] ) .",
    "the perturbative result for the inside of the cylinder is : @xmath96 the case of the flat gap has a different topology , and therefore is worth doing as an example , ( see figure  ( [ figgap ] ) . ) for @xmath97 , clearly there are no configurations of a rod that bridge two points on the surface , and therefore : @xmath98 , ( to assure consistency with sections to come we took @xmath40 to be _",
    "one _ side s area . ) whereas for @xmath99 , we have : @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 . thus : @xmath103it follows that : @xmath104this is to be compared to eq .",
    "( [ strip ] ) below .",
    "we also developed a method to compute the small @xmath19 expansion of the surface tension for a general surface in two and three dimensions .",
    "we leave this discussion to appendix  [ app : smalll ] , and just note here that the expansions of the expressions for the circle , sphere , and the cylinder agree with this general method s predictions . in particular , that @xmath105 is an odd function of @xmath19 for sufficiently small @xmath19 follows from this expansion .",
    "we also tested the surprising prediction of equation([delgamcon3 ] ) in the case of an ellipsoid , the simplest non - trivial case in 3 dimensions , by performing random insertion sampling . since the prediction for the surface tension is in the limit of a non - interaction gas of rods ,",
    "we need only consider the behavior of one rod of length @xmath19 in our numerical experiment .",
    "the algorithm is as follows .",
    "we choose a volume @xmath106 around the ellipsoid of semi - axis @xmath107 that is large enough to encompass the ellipsoid and a shell of thickness @xmath108 around the ellipsoid .",
    "we then randomly select @xmath109 center of mass positions and orientations for the rod of length @xmath19 .",
    "the center of mass must be in @xmath106 excluding @xmath110 , the volume of the ellipsoid itself . by noting the fraction @xmath111 of insertions that lead to overlap between the rod and the ellipsoid",
    "we can express the surface - tension as : @xmath112 in units of @xmath113 .",
    "@xmath114 denotes the surface area of the ellipsoid .",
    "when we choose @xmath115 , our numerical experiment confirms the prediction @xmath116 within an error - bar of @xmath117 for a wide variety of choices for @xmath118 and @xmath19 .",
    "the error - bar on the fraction @xmath111 is @xmath119      although the method of `` bean - counting '' is less efficient than the one described above , it is nevertheless useful for gaining more insight into the reasons for the counterintuitive results above . in this method one",
    "performs first the angular integration over @xmath35 to obtain the rod density @xmath37 . in the particular cases of flat , cylindrical and spherical surfaces",
    ", the excess surface energy is then obtained from @xmath120 with @xmath121 the perpendicular distance from the surface , and @xmath122 the jacobian , which depends on the geometry . for flat surfaces",
    "@xmath123 ; for the outside of a cylinder of radius r , @xmath124 , and for a sphere @xmath125 .",
    "for these three geometries there is only a one - dimensional integral ( over @xmath121 ) to be carried out , once @xmath126 is determined . differently from the previous sections ,",
    "we define hereafter the rod coordinates by the position of its center of mass .",
    "for example , for a plane with rods on one side ( see figure  ( [ figflat ] ) ) , we have : @xmath127   \\;=\\;\\int_0^{l/2 } dz \\ ,",
    "\\left[1-\\frac{2z}{l}\\right]={l\\over 4 } \\label{planeone}\\ ] ] notice that the rod concentration @xmath128 is different from the monomer concentration .",
    "the evaluation of this second quantity is slightly more involved but can be calculated following auvray @xcite .",
    "this gives : @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the bulk monomer concentration for a solution of rods with @xmath131 monomers .",
    "the calculation of the phase space available to a rod in the presence of a curved surface is somewhat different from the one for a flat surface , for now it is possible for the rod to contact the wall in two different ways ( see figure  ( [ figsph ] ) ) : when the rod is sufficiently far from the surface the tip touches the wall upon rotation , whereas when the rod is sufficiently close to the wall , it will be tangent to the surface at some point along its length .",
    "the critical @xmath121 value separating these two regions is @xmath132 .",
    "the phase spaces arising from these two configurations have different functional forms . in the inside of the sphere , of course",
    ", the tangent construction is not possible , but now there is a minimum distance beyond which it is not possible to place the center of mass of the rod  this happens at @xmath133",
    ". a closer look at the results from the previous sections reveals that the surface tension is _ non - analytic _ in the curvature ; e.g. that even for arbitrarily small @xmath134 , one has neither @xmath135 nor @xmath136 .",
    "this invalidates the usual extrapolation of the free energy results from the cylindrical and the spherical shapes to arbitrary bending states .",
    "we can see that the difference between @xmath137 , and @xmath138 is the basic reason for this non - analyticity .",
    "it is also possible to compute the monomer densities in the spherical configuration , we present these in appendix  [ app : sphere ] .    from equation  ( [ planeone ] )",
    "it is clear that differences between the excess energy of a flat and a curved surface depend on two factors .",
    "the first is the configurational part measured by the differences in the rod density profiles , the second one is associated with the space available to the center of mass , and is measured by @xmath122 . in the case of hard sphere solutions , where there is no coupling between configuration and curvature , only @xmath122 is responsible for energy differences ; the profile of particle concentration , @xmath139 , is independent of geometry .",
    "it is easy to show that in that case one has @xmath140 for cylindrical surfaces and @xmath141 for spherical ones . in the case of rod solutions",
    ", there is a coupling between the configuration of the rods and the surface curvature : the concentration profiles are a function of the surface curvature . given this coupling ,",
    "the exact correspondence among the free energies of all convex - shaped rod - systems , proven in section  [ sec : convex bodies ] , is rather surprising .",
    "this implies that curvature contributions to free energy([deltafcs ] ) from both the profile and the jacobian integrate out to a total vanishing value .",
    "this cancellation is non - local , i.e. at a given @xmath121 away from the surface the total phase space for the center of mass does not change as to compensate for the configurational changes in the profile .",
    "one can gain further insight into the issue by recalling equation  ( [ deltafcs ] ) , and considering figure  ( [ figden ] ) .",
    "the surface tension is just the total `` area '' between the curves @xmath126 and @xmath3 _ weighted _ by the appropriate jacobian .",
    "the surface tension for the plane is simply the sum of the shaded areas i and ii , whereas the surface tension for the outside of the sphere is the _ weighted _ `` area '' of i only , which happens to be the same .",
    "the relevant weighted areas are shown in figure  ( [ figdenjac ] ) .    also , we pointed out that in general the surface tension decreases as the surface develops concave regions , e.g. @xmath142 , i.e. the sum of the weighted `` areas '' of the regions i , ii , and iii in figure  ( [ figden ] ) is _ smaller _ than the area of i. therefore a flat surface with rods on one side would be able to lower its energy by bending _ towards _ the rods in a spherical shape ; and if there are rods on both sides , since @xmath143 , they would destabilize the flat surface towards bending .      for a flexible surface ,",
    "e.g. a membrane , one computes the renormalization of the bending rigidities by assuming that @xmath144 , the excess free energy per unit area of the system is expandable in a power series in the curvature , i.e. the excess free energy is analytic in the curvature .",
    "then up to quadratic order in the principal curvatures @xmath145 and @xmath146 , this expansion can be written in terms of the mean and gaussian curvatures of the surface @xcite . in terms of the principal radii , the mean curvature is , and",
    "the gaussian curvature is . a general form of @xmath144 to this order is given by : , where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the contributions from the excess free energy to @xmath149 and @xmath150 , the bare elastic constants of the membrane .",
    "@xmath151 is the induced spontaneous curvature of the system .    as an example",
    "we calculate first the modifications of the elastic constants of a membrane immersed in a dilute solution of hard spheres . as quoted above @xmath152 for cylindrical surfaces ( @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) and @xmath155 for spherical surfaces ( @xmath156 .",
    "this leads to @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 .    for a membrane exposed to a rod solution",
    ", the non - analyticity of the free energy might imply that the extracted bending rigidities are not meaningful for all states of curvature of the membrane .",
    "in particular , bending states where the principal radii of curvature have opposite signs might not be described by the usual helfrich expansion . with this note of caution in mind",
    ", we computed the renormalization of the bending rigidities for a membrane exposed to a rod solution on both sides :    @xmath160    it is interesting that there is no spontaneous curvature induced by the rods , since there is no symmetry reason why this should be the case .",
    "though , our `` small @xmath19 analysis '' in appendix  [ app : smalll ] shows that this is an ( almost ) general property of rod - systems .",
    "the modifications of the elastic constants ( a decrease of @xmath149 and an increase of @xmath161 indicating a preference to form periodic minimal surfaces ) are similar to results for depletion of other macromolecular species .",
    "however , the magnitude of this effect can be here much larger than @xmath25 , a feature not found in other depletion systems .",
    "it is of order of @xmath162 , where @xmath20 is the thickness of the rod and @xmath163 is the onsager concentration for rigid rods . even at the onsager concentration",
    "the enhancement factor @xmath164 can lead to very large contributions .",
    "here we consider rods in shells where both surfaces of the shells are repulsive .",
    "the shells are taken to be in equilibrium with a bulk reservoir of a rod solution at bulk concentration @xmath3 .",
    "the thickness of the shells is denoted by @xmath78 , the perpendicular distance from the inner surface by @xmath121 .",
    "the volume , and the thickness of the box are kept fixed as it gets bent .",
    "when @xmath165 , the results in this section follow from the ones in the previous sections , since the effects of the two surfaces do not interfere with one another . when @xmath166 however , there is interference and one needs to calculate the allowed phase space by accounting for interactions with both surfaces .",
    "we consider rods confined inside flat or curved shells , but in equilibrium with a rod solution . by comparing the energies of flat , spherical and cylindrical shells , we hope to investigate for rods a question that has recently been investigated for flexible polymers@xcite and mesoscopic quantum systems@xcite : do the curved regions in confined systems act as attractive potentials , where the concentration of particles will be greater , or as depletive potentials from where",
    "particles will be repelled ?",
    "table  [ potentials ] summarizes the systems studied so far , including the case of confined rods treated below .      a straightforward calculation for a flat strip of thickness @xmath167 confining a rods solution yields :    @xmath168    as usual",
    ", the interfacial energy is expressed in units of @xmath169 .",
    "note that for separations larger than the rod - length the interfacial energy is just the sum of two contributions from the inside surfaces .",
    "when the surfaces are taken to be also in contact with a solution outside ( see figure  ( .[figbox ] ) ) we get :    @xmath170      we are able to calculate the available phase space , and thus the surface tension of a spherical shell exactly .",
    "the result has four regions , across the boundaries of which the functional form of @xmath171 changes .",
    "this happens because one needs to consider the relative positions of @xmath172 , @xmath173 , which were defined earlier , and @xmath174 , the point separating the two regions where the rod only touches the upper surface and the one where it only touches the lower one .",
    "the extent of the first two regions vanishes with curvature ; the results below tend asymptotically to the ones for the flat strip in the limit of small curvature .",
    "we took @xmath40 as the surface area of the flat box with the same volume and thickness .",
    "we leave the full results to the appendix and give here the expansions in @xmath175 .",
    "@xmath176    one can check by comparing eq.([strip ] ) with eq.([sphshellexp ] ) that for any separation the surface tension of the spherical shell is larger than that of the flat box .",
    "we conclude therefore that rods prefer to stay in flat regions of the confining box rather than in spherically curved ones .",
    "this can be further checked by computing the average rod concentration inside the flat shell and comparing it to the value inside the spherically bent shell ; the latter will be smaller than the former .",
    "we show below that cylindrical shells induce the opposite , i.e. attract rods , for @xmath19 less than but close to @xmath78 .",
    "results for a spherical shell immersed in a a rod solution can be easily obtained by adding to eq.([sphshellexp ] ) the outside and inside contributions of eq.([sphere ] ) .",
    "the cylindrical shell calculation is substantially more involved than the ones for planar or spherical shells .",
    "we resorted to a perturbation in @xmath177 in this section , and stayed at separations close to the rod - length , i.e. the results below for @xmath166 should be understood to be valid only in a finite region close to l. again , choosing @xmath40 as the flat box s surface area , we find :    @xmath178    the results for the cylindrical shells are , at least for separations close to the rod - length , opposite of those for the spherical shells : the surface energy in this case is smaller than that for the flat strip .",
    "rod - like molecules will therefore be attracted by cylindrically bent shells .      as explained above , for small curvatures , it is possible to describe the elastic properties of a surface , by three parameters : the spontaneous curvature @xmath151 , and the bending rigidities @xmath149 , and @xmath179 . in this paragraph",
    "we compute these parameters for a flexible box , such as a membrane , exposed to rods .",
    "for all cases @xmath180 , as it should be due to the symmetry of the geometry .",
    "for an open shell with rods on the inside only we find :    @xmath181    for a strip immersed in a solution of rods , i.e. a system with rods inside and outside the shell we find :    @xmath182",
    "a rigid rod can be viewed as the particular limit of a freely - hinged polymer chain with one monomer only , see figure  ( [ fighinged ] ) . in the reverse limit ,",
    "when the polymerization number @xmath131 is very large , the equilibrium configurations of such a chain are well described by gaussian statistics .",
    "we now describe to some extent the crossover between these two limits .    for a membrane in contact with a dilute solution of gaussian polymers , it is possible to calculate the excess surface energy@xcite .",
    "for instance , a sphere in @xmath183 dimensions immersed in a such a solution increases its surface energy by @xmath184 with @xmath7 the monomer size ( and total length @xmath185 ) . for a sphere in three dimensions",
    "this reduces to :    @xmath186    note that for the gaussian polymer case , there is an analytical expansion of the free - energy in powers of the curvature , the case of a solution inside a sphere can simply be obtained from the result above by a sign permutation @xmath187 .",
    "the scaling of the first term in equation ( [ eisen2 ] ) implies that for a plane the excess surface energy decreases by a factor of @xmath188 when one increases by a factor @xmath189 the number of links in a chain of length @xmath19 .    in the rod limit ( @xmath190 ) , one has in the flat case , @xmath191 .",
    "the ( @xmath192)-calculation for the flat case is straightforward and gives : @xmath193 where @xmath194 is still the total length of the polymer .",
    "interestingly , even for such a small monomer number , doubling the number of monomers reduces the surface tension by @xmath195 , a factor not too different from @xmath188 in the gaussian ( large @xmath131 ) limit .",
    "it is also possible to write down a general integral expression for the surface tension near a flat wall for any @xmath131 where all the integrals are in principle doable ; we left this to the appendix , eq .",
    "( [ flatn ] ) .",
    "the surface tension for ( @xmath192 ) in- and outside of a sphere can be calculated using the same methods as for the rods ( @xmath196 ) .",
    "we leave the exact outside result to the appendix , eq .",
    "( [ n2sph ] ) , and expand it here in the curvature : @xmath197    the exact inside result is simply : @xmath198 notice that there is now a spontaneous curvature .",
    "moreover , the sign of it is positive for the outside , as it is for ideal polymers @xcite . also , the asymmetry between the in- and the outside cases , which is the cause of the non - analyticity in the curvature free energy , is exactly one - third of what it is for ( @xmath196 ) .",
    "furthermore , the overall magnitude of the @xmath199 term is about half of what it is for the rigid rod .",
    "this term does not exist for the polymer .",
    "therefore , even the introduction of one single link in the rigid rod , brings the results closer to those of the flexible polymer case .",
    "we studied the depletion interactions of curved surfaces exposed to dilute rod solutions .",
    "we find that in general , the excess surface energy caused by the depletion interactions depends on the exact shape of the surface .",
    "for instance , the surface tension of a plane exposed to a dilute solution of rods of length @xmath19 increases by @xmath200 , with @xmath3 the rod number concentration of the solution , whereas the equivalent quantity for a spherical surface in contact with such a solution _ inside _ the sphere is @xmath201 , with @xmath13 the radius of curvature of the sphere .    surprisingly , we found also that a spherical surface in contact with a rod solution _ outside _ of the sphere has the _ same _ excess surface energy as the flat surface @xmath202 .",
    "moreover we proved that this equality holds for any convex surface exposed to the solution .",
    "this implies that the excess energy of any convex body immersed in a dilute rod solution only depends on the total surface of the body and not on its actual shape ( as long as it is convex ) .",
    "a similar equality also holds in any dimension of space .",
    "for instance in two dimensions , the line tension for a straight line is @xmath203 with @xmath204 the `` bulk '' surface rod density , and has the same value for rods outside of a circle .",
    "the first practical implication of our results is that a flexible membrane immersed in a solution ( thus exposed to the depletion rod layer on both sides ) will spontaneously break its curvature symmetry .",
    "also , a membrane exposed to a rod solution ( on one side ) will spontaneously bend towards the solution .",
    "the experimental observation of these effects will depend on the magnitude of the symmetry breaking field .",
    "this can be measured by comparing the relative importance of induced modifications in the elastic constants of the membrane .",
    "typical values of the bare elastic constants are in the range @xmath205 . the induced shift to these bare constants are for most systems like hard spheres or flexible polymers , only a fraction of @xmath25 .",
    "however for rod solutions , at the onsager concentration , the induced modification is a factor @xmath164 larger than @xmath25 , and can potentially be very large .",
    "when the rods are confined in curved shells , we showed that regions with cylindrical curvature attract the rods , whereas regions with spherical curvature deplete the rods .",
    "this enlightens a recent discussion on confinement effects in solutions of flexible polymers@xcite and in mesoscopic quantum systems@xcite .",
    "table  [ potentials ] summarizes results in a variety of systems .",
    "the methods that we developed for this work can be applied to other geometries and other situations .",
    "work is under progress to exactly evaluate rod - mediated sphere - sphere interactions . also of interest",
    "are the effects of attractive interactions on the bending constants of membranes exposed to rod solutions .",
    "we remark also that the steric surface interactions are identical for rigid rods and rigid disks near surfaces , if one takes the rod s length and the disk s diameter to be the same ; however the disk system does not enjoy the above - mentioned @xmath164 enhancement .",
    "the shell calculations also generalize to the disks if the radius of the disks is sufficiently small .",

    "when @xmath19 is small ( or the radii of curvature large ) we can expand the excess free energy in powers of @xmath19 .",
    "we do this first for the 2-d case .",
    "we start with eq .",
    "( [ ddelgamlrestwo ] ) . for @xmath19 small",
    ", @xmath207 is a function only of the point @xmath208 and the expansion of the shape around it .",
    "we assume that @xmath19 is small enough that rods of length @xmath19 starting at @xmath208 can only reach out to points which are nearby along the surface . if the surface is convex in this region , there are no points @xmath83 , and the function is 0 .",
    "we ignore inflection points , because they will generally be of measure 0 ( except for plane regions , where the function is also 0 ) .",
    "we assume that there are no corners .",
    "this leaves only regions where the surface is concave . around the point",
    "@xmath208 we can draw the tangent to the surface as the @xmath209-axis , with @xmath208 at @xmath210 , and let the curve s shape be given by the function @xmath211 , ( see figure  ( [ figtheorem2 ] ) . ) the function @xmath111 will have a taylor expansion : @xmath212where the @xmath213 are functions of @xmath208 .",
    "we want to find the two values of @xmath209 such that rods of length @xmath19 start at the origin and hit the curve ( see figure  ( [ figtheorem2 ] ) . )",
    "that is , we need solutions to @xmath214 .",
    "there are two solutions , which for @xmath19 small are near @xmath215 .",
    "we can expand in powers of @xmath19 , and to @xmath216 order find : @xmath217it is not hard to show that the two solutions @xmath218 are given by the same power series , except with the sign of the odd powers in @xmath19 reversed .",
    "another way to say this is that the two values of @xmath209 are given by one power series in @xmath219 . given the shape @xmath211 and values @xmath218 , we can calculate the cosines and cotangents ( see figure  ( [ figtheorem2 ] ) ) : @xmath220plugging in the expansion of @xmath218 to order @xmath221 we get : @xmath222 in the sum over @xmath218 , the terms of order @xmath221 canceled out . because @xmath218 is a function of @xmath215 , functions of @xmath218 are also functions of @xmath215 .",
    "the expression for @xmath223 above uses only functions of @xmath218 and @xmath224 , so is again a function of @xmath215 .",
    "it follows that when we sum over @xmath83 , all terms odd in @xmath19 will cancel out in @xmath207 , so @xmath225 and @xmath171 are odd functions of @xmath19 for @xmath19 small !",
    "if we put everything together , and integrate , we get : @xmath226here @xmath13 is the local radius of curvature , and @xmath227 indicates that we are averaging @xmath228 over the perimeter of the object , weighting by arclength .",
    "we set @xmath228 to 0 where the object is convex .",
    "the assumption that there are no corners is necessary  for example , for rods inside a rectangle there will be terms of order @xmath229 . and",
    "if @xmath19 is too large , we can no longer do this small @xmath19 expansion and @xmath171 does not have to be an odd function of @xmath19  for example , if we are inside a closed body , and @xmath19 is larger than all lengths of the body , @xmath171 is simply a nonzero constant independent of @xmath19 .",
    "the expansion in 3 dimensions is a little more complicated , but essentially the same .",
    "we again assume that there are no corners , and that inflection points outside of plane regions are a set of measure 0 .",
    "we have a tangent @xmath230-plane and a function @xmath231 .",
    "we expand @xmath231 in powers of @xmath209 and @xmath232 , starting at @xmath233 and @xmath234 and rotating out the @xmath230 term .",
    "the solutions to @xmath235 are a near - circle .",
    "letting @xmath236 be the angle in the @xmath230 plane , and putting @xmath237 we have @xmath238note that @xmath239 .",
    "we now need to look for solutions of @xmath240 for each particular @xmath236 .",
    "but this is just the 2-d problem , which has already been done .",
    "the only additional complication is the arclength factor , which can be rewritten in spherical coordinates as : @xmath241the values of @xmath111 at angles @xmath236 and @xmath242 have the same power series in @xmath215 , and @xmath19 only appears independently in @xmath243 .",
    "so as in the 2-d case , @xmath171 is an odd function of @xmath19 for @xmath19 small .",
    "the low order expansion in @xmath19 gives : @xmath244 \\\\     & = & l^3{\\pi\\over 4}(3\\ , c_{20}^2 + 2\\ , c_{20}\\ , c_{22 }          + 3\\ , c_{22}^2 ) + o(l^5 ) \\end{array } \\label{smalll5}\\]]integrating twice and rewriting in terms of the principal radii of curvature , @xmath245once again , when taking this average it is understood that we take the quantity inside the parentheses to be zero if the surface is concave at the point at hand .",
    "now in terms of the gaussian and the mean curvatures : @xmath246",
    "the probability of finding a rod s center of mass @xmath121 away from a sphere can be calculated by first computing the allowed angular phase in figure  ( [ figsph ] ) and then integrating over the angles . for convenience",
    "we define @xmath247 , and still use @xmath248 .",
    "we find for these probabilities :    @xmath249    the monomer concentration in- and out - side of a sphere can be computed following the construction in @xcite .",

    "this concentration profile calculation , for the outside is done in @xcite as well , where the author also finds these three regimes .",
    "our result agrees with his in regimes ii and ( trivially ) iii .",
    "but we differ in regime i. since his result is not continuous across the boundary between i and ii we believe that his calculation for that case is inaccurate .",
    "our result is continuous , and furthermore the full profile integrates to the full partition function for this geometry , which is a non - trivial consistency check .",
    "the profile for the inside is also continuous and integrates to the partition function for the inside of the sphere  again a non - trivial consistency check .",
    "the full , exact expression for the surface tension in a spherical shell is given by : @xmath255 where @xmath256 , and    @xmath257",
    "the integral expression for the surface tension of an @xmath131-polymer around a flat surface is :      where @xmath259 , and @xmath260 is the step - function .",
    "this formula gives the same answers as our intuitive way of doing these integrals for ( @xmath196 ) , and ( @xmath192 . ) with sufficient patience or efficient programming it should be straightforward to see how the result changes as @xmath131 grows larger ."
