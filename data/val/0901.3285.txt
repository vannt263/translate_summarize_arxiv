    "since its realization in dilute atomic gases , superfluidity of alkali atoms has been studied extensively in various externally controllable environments  @xcite . for the case of fermionic systems , superfluidity arises due to the bose condensation of pairs of fermions at low temperatures .",
    "one of the most fascinating control parameters has been the two - body scattering length between two atoms in two hyperfine spin states .",
    "the two - body scattering length in three dimensions ( 3d ) can be controlled dramatically by the use of magnetically tuned feshbach resonance  @xcite . for dilute atomic systems at low temperatures ,",
    "the two - body interaction is linearly proportional to the scattering length in 3d . as a result of this proportionality , by controlling the two - body scattering length ,",
    "the smooth crossover between the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of strongly bound diatomic molecules to the bcs limit of weakly bound cooper pairs has been observed experimentally . for a negative scattering length ,",
    "the interaction between two atoms in two hyperfine spin states is attractive and momentum space paring gives bcs superfluidity at low temperatures . for a positive scattering length , the interaction is repulsive and two body bound states exist in the vacuum gives composite bosonic nature for two atoms paired in coordinate space .",
    "bose einstein condensation of these composite bosons gives superfluidity on the bec side of the resonance .",
    "these two regimes smoothly connect at unitarity where the scattering length is infinite in 3d .",
    "for attractive two body potentials in two dimensions ( 2d ) , there always exists a two body bound state .",
    "the 2d bound state energy depends on both 3d scattering length and the laser intensity which used to create one dimensional lattice to accommodate 2d layers .",
    "therefore , 2d paring interactions can be controlled by tuning either the 3d scattering length or the laser intensity .",
    "the most recent experiments with ultra - cold fermi gasses have been the focuss of population imbalance which leads to the competition between superfluidity and magnetism  @xcite .",
    "because of the large spin relaxation time of the atoms , experimentalists were able to maintain a fixed polarization @xmath0 over the entire time of the experiments , here @xmath1 is the number of atoms in up / down pseudo spin state .    for the systems of atoms trapped in external harmonic potentials in three - dimensions , phase separation between normal phases and various superfluid phases has been experimentally observed  @xcite",
    ". theoretical investigation of population imbalanced fermion paring in three - dimensions ( 3d ) has been encouraged by these series of recent experiments  @xcite . for",
    "spatially homogenous systems , various exotic phases , such as sarma phase , fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase , a phase with deformed fermi surfaces , and phase separation have been suggested  @xcite . in trapped systems ,",
    "various phases are separated into concentric shells and the shell structure depends on both the interaction strength and the polarization  @xcite .",
    "the boundary between normal and superfluid regions depends on the trap geometry .",
    "experiments done in high aspect ratio traps show that the superfluid - normal boundary does not follow the equipotential contours of the trap and show significant distortion of the central superfluid region  @xcite .",
    "quit remarkably , this distortion of the central superfluid shell can be explained by the surface tension between superfluid and normal regions  @xcite .",
    "local microscopic physics on the superfluid - normal boundary ( due to the energy cost ) causes this surface tension .",
    "the most recent theoretical studies in 3d reveal the importance of the interaction in the normal phase to correctly explain the experimentally observed chandrasekhar - clogston limit of critical polarization  @xcite .",
    "the recent theoretical efforts of understanding the fermion pairing in two - dimensional population imbalanced systems attempt to explore the phase diagram in the bcs - bec crossover region  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , such a system can be created by applying a relatively strong one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical potential to an ordinary three - dimensional system .",
    "previous theoretical studies have concentrated on the nature of various phases in 2d layers where the tunneling between layers are neglected .    as the experimental setup in 2d",
    "is created out of an ordinary 3d system by applying a 1d lattice , atom tunneling between layers are always present .",
    "this inter - layer atomic tunneling can be controlled by a single parameter , namely the intensity of the 1d optical lattice .",
    "the purpose of the present work is ; ( 1 ) understand the effect of tunneling , ( 2 ) find out how one can control the phase transitions by using this easy controllability , and ( 3 ) study possible fflo phase in 2d .",
    "the motivation of studying fflo phase came from the fact that fflo phase is more favorable in low dimensions  @xcite . in 3d",
    ", fflo phase has not been seen in experiments , though theory predicts that such a phase can exist in a narrow parameter region in the weakly interacting limit .",
    "the first part of this work is a natural generalization of the work presented in refs .",
    "@xcite to include the weak atom tunneling between atomic layers .",
    "we find that the first order superfluid - normal phase transition can be effectively controlled by the laser intensity .",
    "in typical 3d population imbalanced gases , one has to change the population imbalance to control the superfluid - normal phase transition .",
    "moreover , we find that the inclusion of tunneling allows to stabilize the polarized superfluid phase in bec regime .",
    "further , in the weak coupling bcs limit , we investigate the possible inhomogeneous fflo phase near the tricritical point of superfluid , fflo , and normal phases and find that the normal - fflo phase transition is of first order .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we consider a zero temperature mean field theory and derive analytical expressions for the energy , density and gap equation for weakly coupled layers .",
    "then we predict the phase diagram in the entire bcs - bec crossover region and discuss the effect of weak atom tunneling on the superfluid - normal boundary . in section iii",
    ", we neglect the coupling between layers and use a landau - ginzberg functional approach at finite temperatures . in the weak coupling bcs limit , we derive an analytical expression for the landau s free energy functional and discuss the possible fflo phase near the tricritical point .",

    "<S> we use a landau - ginzberg functional approach to investigate the possibility of spatially inhomogeneous fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase in the weakly interacting bcs limit near the tricritical point of spatially homogenous superfluid , fflo , and normal phases . </S>",
