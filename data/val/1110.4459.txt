    "as a valuable tool for various scientific disciplines , fractals introduced by mandelbrot  @xcite have received considerable attention in many fields in the past few decades  @xcite .",
    "the so - called regular fractals constitute an integral family of fractals , including the sierpinski triangle  @xcite , hierarchical lattice fractal  @xcite , vicsek fractals  @xcite , @xmath0 fractal  @xcite , peano basin fractal  @xcite , to name a few .",
    "these simple fractal structures have been a focus of extensive research  @xcite .",
    "a great advantage of regular fractals is that many problems about them can be treated analytically , presenting a first step in understanding the structural and dynamical proprieties of general fractals .",
    "a fundamental problem in the study of fractals is to find the relations between structural properties of fractals and their dynamics , which remains one of the great challenges in the realm of nonlinear science . as a paradigmatic dynamical process ,",
    "random walks on fractals play a crucial role in a wide range of applications  @xcite , therefore have been intensely investigated  @xcite .",
    "these investigations have uncovered some nontrivial effects of topological structures of different fractals on the behavior of random walks . among various random - walk issues",
    "@xcite , the trapping problem on fractals are becoming increasingly important since many phenomena built on fractals can be described by random walks  @xcite .",
    "particularly , the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) to the trap node in a network has been widely studied  @xcite due to its role as an indicator of the transport efficiency .    in view of the importance of mfpt",
    "@xcite , a huge amount of effort has been devoted to developing techniques to determine mfpt to a given node , and numerous methods have been proposed , including the generating function  @xcite , renormalization group  @xcite , back - forward equation  @xcite , and so on .",
    "most of existing methods are presented for particular networks and thus are applicable only to some specific structures .",
    "a universal technique for general networks is still unavailable , with the exception of the spectral approach , through which the mfpt from a node to another can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors of a related transition matrix  @xcite . for the trapping problem , the average trapping time ( att ) , i.e.",
    ", the mfpt to the trap , can be approximated by the inverse of the smallest eigenvalue of an associated matrix  @xcite .",
    "irrespectively of the generality of the spectral approach , the computational complexity for determining the spectra of generic networks is very high  @xcite , which makes the task very difficult and even impossible for large networks . in this context , it is of interest to seek new techniques for evaluating the spectrum of a relevant matrix for some particular networks .    in this paper",
    ", we study a random walk problem on a family of treelike regular fractals  @xcite with a perfect trap fixed at a central node .",
    "the fractals under investigation include both the @xmath0 fractal  @xcite and the peano basin fractal  @xcite as their particular limiting cases . using the real - space decimation procedure , we derive an explicit recursive relation for the eigenvalues of a matrix associated with the trapping issue .",
    "we then continue to determine the full spectrum of eigenvalues and their multiplicities of the relevant matrix . in the end",
    ", we derive a recursion relation for the smallest eigenvalues at two consecutive iterations of the fractals , based on which we obtain an approximate value of the final smallest eigenvalue and then further evaluate the att .",
    "the fractals under consideration are constructed in the following iterative way  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) denote the fractals after @xmath3 iterations . initially ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 consists of an edge linking two nodes .",
    "in each subsequent iteration @xmath6 , @xmath1 is obtained from @xmath7 by performing the following operations on each existing edge as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ cons ] : replace the edge by a path two - links long , with the two end points of the path being the same end points of the original edge ; then , create @xmath8 ( an natural number ) new nodes and attach them individually to the middle node of the path . figure  [ network ] describes the first three steps of the iterative construction process for a particular fractal corresponding to @xmath9 .",
    "the family of fractals , controlled by parameter @xmath8 , includes several well - known fractals as its limiting cases : when @xmath10 , it reduces to the @xmath0 fractal  @xcite ; when @xmath11 , it recovers the peano basin fractal  @xcite .    .",
    "]    the studied fractals have an obvious self - similar structure , which can be seen from their alternative construction approach .",
    "if we call the central node ( node @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ network ] , for example ) the innermost node and those nodes farthest from the central node the outermost nodes , then the fractals can also be built as follows ( see fig .  [ const2 ] ) : given the generation @xmath3 , we can obtain @xmath13 by merging @xmath14 copies of @xmath1 with the @xmath14 outermost nodes in separate replicas being coalesced into a single new node , i.e. , the innermost node in @xmath13 .     by joining @xmath14 copies of @xmath1 , represented by @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is the innermost node , while @xmath21 is an outermost node . ]",
    "it is easy to derive that the total numbers of edges and nodes in @xmath1 are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "some other properties of the fractals can also be determined  @xcite .",
    "their fractal dimension is @xmath24 , while their random - walk dimension is @xmath25/\\ln2 $ ] .",
    "thus , their spectral dimension is @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "in this section , we study the discrete - time unbiased random walks taking place on the fractals @xmath1 . in the process of the classical random walks , at each time step , the particle ( walker ) starts from its current location and moves to any of its nearest - neighboring nodes with the same probability equal to the reciprocal of the degree of the current node .",
    "now , consider the probability distribution function @xmath27 , which is the probability for the walker being on node @xmath28 at time @xmath29 .",
    "if the starting point for the walker is @xmath30 , then the stochastic master equation governing the evolution of @xmath27 is  @xcite @xmath31 with the initial condition @xmath32 .    in eq .",
    "( [ sme ] ) , if @xmath33 is not equal to @xmath28 , @xmath34 is the jumping probability from node @xmath33 to node @xmath28 , but @xmath35 otherwise ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "note that we can consider @xmath34 as an entry of matrix @xmath37 , called the transition matrix , which suggests that the powerful methods of the spectral theory for matrices  @xcite can be applied .",
    "we focus on a trapping problem which is a particular case of random walks on @xmath1 with a trap fixed on the central node of the fractals . for this case ,",
    "the transition matrix is a submatrix of @xmath37 , which is obtained from @xmath37 by deleting the row and column corresponding to the trap node . in the case without any confusion , we also use @xmath37 to represent the transition matrix of the trapping problem . below",
    "we will use the decimation method  @xcite to determine the complete spectrum of eigenvalues and their degeneracies , and demonstrate that the reciprocal of the smallest eigenvalue has the same scaling as that of the att .",
    "notice that previous works have studied analytically the laplacian spectra for different treelike graphs , e.g. , dendrimers  @xcite , vicsek fractals  @xcite , and related structures , say husimi - cacti  @xcite . here",
    "we concentrate on the normalized laplacian matrix , since for an irregular graph , its laplacian matrix and normalized laplacian matrix behave quite differently , and the latter seems to be more natural  @xcite .",
    "the decimation method has an advantage that one can solve the eigenvalue equation based on a similar problem from the previous iteration .",
    "let @xmath38 denote the set of nodes belonging to @xmath1 , and @xmath39 the set of nodes generated at iteration @xmath40 .",
    "then , one can write the eigenvalue problem for the transition matrix @xmath41 in the following block form : @xmath42 \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc }   u_{\\alpha } \\\\   u_{\\beta } \\end{array } \\right]={\\lambda}_{g+1 } \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc }   u_{\\alpha } \\\\",

    "( [ t4 ] ) , one obtains @xmath50 provided that the concerned matrix is invertible . inserting eq .",
    "( [ t5 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ t3 ] ) leads to @xmath51u_{\\alpha}={\\lambda}_{g+1}u_{\\alpha}.\\ ] ]    thus , the problem of determining the eigenvalue @xmath52 for matrix @xmath41 of order @xmath53 is reduced to computing the eigenvalue problem of a matrix with a smaller order of @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "next , we will show that matrix @xmath56 can be related to matrix @xmath57 , and thus the eigenvalue @xmath52 for matrix @xmath41 can be expressed in terms of eigenvalue @xmath58 for matrix @xmath57 . to this end , we define @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the identity matrix of the same order as @xmath57 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 equation  ( [ t7 ] ) indicates that the eigenvalues of @xmath63 are related to those of @xmath57 . in the appendix , we prove that @xmath64 , thus the eigenvalues of @xmath41 can be obtained through determining the spectrum of @xmath57 .    substituting @xmath63 for @xmath56 , eq .",
    "( [ t6 ] ) becomes @xmath65 which means @xmath66 that is , @xmath67 if @xmath68 denotes the eigenvalue of @xmath57 corresponding to the eigenvector @xmath69 , eq .",
    "( [ t12 ] ) implies @xmath70 plugging eqs .",
    "( [ t8 ] ) and  ( [ t9 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ t13 ] ) , one can see that the eigenvalue @xmath71 for transition matrix @xmath41 is related to that of @xmath57 via @xmath72 which can be recast as @xmath73 solving eq .",
    "( [ t15 ] ) gives its two roots @xmath74 which provide two eigenvalues of @xmath41 .",
    "by calculating the eigenvalues numerically , one can find some important properties of the spectra .",
    "first , all eigenvalues appearing at a given generation @xmath75 always exist at the next generation @xmath76 .",
    "second , all new eigenvalues at generation @xmath76 are just those generated via eq .",
    "( [ t16 ] ) by substituting @xmath68 with @xmath77 that are newly added to generation @xmath78 .",
    "that is , all eigenvalues can be obtained by the recurrence relation eq .",
    "( [ t16 ] ) .",
    "then , the next step is to determine the degeneracies of the eigenvalues , based on the two characteristics .",
    "let @xmath79 denote the multiplicity of eigenvalue @xmath80 of the transition matrix @xmath37 .",
    "since each eigenvalue in the fractals can be derived from eigenvalue 1 , we first determine the number of eigenvalue 1 of @xmath37 . for this purpose ,",
    "let @xmath81 be the rank of matrix @xmath82 .",
    "then , the number of eigenvalue of @xmath37 is @xmath83    for the two limiting cases of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , we can easily obtain @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "when @xmath84 , @xmath37 is the identity matrix of order @xmath88 , so @xmath89 . when @xmath85 , @xmath90 is block diagonal , with each of its @xmath14 blocks being the same @xmath88 matrix in the form of @xmath91.\\ ] ] obviously , the rank of each block is 2 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath92 .",
    "in order to determine @xmath93 for the case of @xmath94 , we define @xmath95 as the transition matrix of @xmath96 with the trap located at an outmost node , e.g. , node @xmath21 in fig .",
    "[ const2 ] , and define @xmath97 .",
    "we next show that it is possible to determine exactly the multiplicity of eigenvalue 1 for the fractals at every iteration @xmath94 .",
    "note that for @xmath98 , @xmath99 has the following form : @xmath100,\\ ] ] where @xmath101 @xmath102 satisfies @xmath103,\\ ] ] in which each @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) is a matrix of order @xmath106 , which has @xmath107 elements 0 and only one nonzero element @xmath108 describing the transition probability from one node in a replica of @xmath109 to the innermost node being joined together to form @xmath13 ( see fig .  [ const2 ] ) ; and the superscript @xmath110 of a matrix represents its transpose .    by construction , for any node @xmath111 in @xmath1(@xmath98 ) that is directly connected to the center node , it must have a neighbor @xmath112 with degree 1 .",
    "thus , in matrix @xmath113 , there is only one nonzero element for row @xmath112 and for column @xmath112 , respectively , namely , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "hence , we can use elementary operations of a matrix to eliminate all nonzero element @xmath116 on the last row and the last column of @xmath113 .",
    "then , we have @xmath117 , which implies that @xmath118 .",
    "this , together with @xmath119 , leads to @xmath120 . combining the above - obtained results , the degeneracy of eigenvalue 1 is @xmath121    we proceed to determine the multiplicities of other eigenvalues .",
    "for the convenience of description , on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ t14 ] ) , we define a set @xmath122 it is easy to verify that the cordiality ( number of elements of a set ) of @xmath123 is @xmath124 . on the other hand , from the above discussion",
    ", we can conclude that all the eigenvalues of @xmath37 belong to the set @xmath125 .",
    "moreover , extensive numerical computation on the eigenvalues of the studied fractals shows that the multiplicities of eigenvalues for the transmission matrix of the fractals satisfy @xmath126 . using this property ,",
    "we can obtain the degeneracy of each eigenvalue @xmath80 in @xmath127 as @xmath128 taking into account the degeneracies so obtained , the number of eigenvalues of @xmath37 is found to be @xmath129 which indicates that we have found all the eigenvalues of @xmath37 .      the probability distribution function @xmath130 considered above is very important since it describes the evolution of the system .",
    "many quantities of interest are encoded in this underlying probability distribution function .",
    "for example , in the limit of large system sizes , the att denoted by @xmath131 for the trapping problem on @xmath96 is asymptotically equal to the inverse of the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of @xmath37 , denoted by @xmath132 , that is , @xmath133 .",
    "here , @xmath131 is defined as the average of trapping time @xmath134 of node @xmath135 over all nodes except the innermost trap node .",
    "conceptually , @xmath134 is the expected time for a walker starting from node @xmath135 to reach the trap for the first time .    according to the recurrence relation given by eq .",
    "( [ t16 ] ) that dominates the eigenvalues of the transmission matrix for the fractals at two consecutive iterations , we can evaluate the smallest nonzero eigenvalue @xmath132 of @xmath37 . from eq .",
    "( [ t16 ] ) , we obtain the following obvious recursive relation : @xmath136 using taylor s formula , we have @xmath137 considering the initial condition @xmath138 , eq .",
    "( [ s2 ] ) can be solved by induction to yield @xmath139^{g-1}}\\,.\\ ] ] then , for large networks , @xmath140    we continue to represent @xmath131 as a function of the network size @xmath141 , in order to derive the scaling between these two quantities . from @xmath23 , we have @xmath142 .",
    "hence , for large systems , @xmath131 can be expressed in terms of @xmath143 as @xmath144 thus , for the entire family of the studied fractals , in the limit of large system sizes , the att grows as a power - law function of the network size @xmath141 .",
    "we note that the obtained exponent @xmath145 perfectly agree with the previously obtained result  @xcite .",
    "the so - called discrete - time random - walk problem on a graph can be described by a matrix , therefore the distribution of its eigenvalue spectrum is much of interest . in this paper , we have studied the trapping problem on a class of regular treelike fractals with a deep trap located at the central node .",
    "the self - similar structure of these fractals can be characterized analytically in terms of their eigenvalues .",
    "we have derived a recursive relationship between eigenvalues of a relevant matrix for random walks on the fractals at different iterations by making use of renormalization , for which the computational demands are very low . on the basis of the obtained recursion relation ,",
    "we have characterized the complete set of eigenvalues and further determined their degeneracies .",
    "moreover , we have provided a recursion relation between the smallest nonzero eigenvalues of the fractals at two successive iterations and obtained an approximate expression for the smallest nonzero eigenvalue .",
    "finally , we have evaluated the mfpt to the trap , showing that it is approximately equal to the inverse of the smallest eigenvalue .",
