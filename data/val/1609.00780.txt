    "the prominent edge - on galaxy eso 243 - 49 , located at 95 mpc away in the constellation phoenix ( see afonso et al . 2005 ) , hosts a hyper - luminous x - ray source commonly known as hlx-1 , which is possibly an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) .",
    "this black hole candidate ( bhc ) was first observed in 2004 as a source emitting x - rays in the vicinity of the spiral galaxy eso 243 - 49 and it was catalogued as 2xmm j011028.1 - 460421 .",
    "later , in 2008 the field of this x - ray source was deeply re - imaged by a team led by natalie webb ( the institut de recherche en astrophysique et planetologie in toulouse , france ) .",
    "farrell et al .",
    "2009 suggested that hlx-1 is an intermediate - mass black hole candidate with mass of @xmath9 m@xmath10 because of very high x - ray luminosity of hlx-1 ( @xmath11 erg / s in the 0.2  10 kev range ) and because its disk blackbody spectrum peaked at @xmath122 kev along with its x - ray spectral variability .",

    "2012 ; wiersema et al . 2010 ; soria et al . 2010 ) and radio observations ( see webb et al .",
    "2012 ) support the presence of an intermediate - mass bh in eso 243 - 49 hlx-1 .",
    "long - term monitoring with the @xmath0/xrt has shown that x - ray luminosity of hlx-1 changes by a factor of @xmath1350 ( godet et al .",
    "2009 ; yan et al .",
    "2015 ) , and its spectral variability is reminiscent of that seen in galactic stellar - mass bhs ( see servillat et al .",
    "specifically , the x - ray light curve demonstrates a recurrent fast rise - exponential decay ",
    "( fred ) type of pattern in the range of @xmath13370  460 days .",
    "this recurrency has been interpreted as an orbital period of the companion star ( see lasota et al .",
    "2011 and soria 2013 ) .",
    "however , the last 2 outbursts have been too late to be consistent with that explanation .",
    "the interval between the last two outbursts is almost 3 months longer than the interval between the first two [ soria ( 2015 ) , a private communication ] .",
    "recently , webb et al . (",
    "2012 ) , hereafter w12 , reported a detection of transient radio emission at the location of hlx-1 , which agrees with a discrete jet ejection event .",
    "these observations also allowed w12 to re - estimate the bh mass to be between @xmath139@xmath1410@xmath15 m@xmath16 and @xmath139@xmath1410@xmath17 m@xmath16 .",
    "in contrast , king & lasota ( 2014 ) suggested that hlx-1 may be a stellar mass binary like ss  433 ( see also lasota et al .",
    "2015 ) , in which the x - ray emission possibly comes from the beamed jet .    hlx-1 is projected in the sky at @xmath130.8 kpc out of the plane and @xmath133.3 kpc ( @xmath188 \") of the nucleus of the s0/a galaxy eso 243 - 49 ( the luminosity distance @xmath13 96 mpc ) .",
    "galaxy eso 243 - 49 is a member of the cluster abell 2877 ( e.g. malumuth et al .",
    "the association of hlx-1 with eso 243 - 49 is confirmed by the redshift measurements of the observed h@xmath19 emission line of the counterpart ( soria et al .",
    "2013 , hereafter shp13 ; wiersema",
    "et al . 2010 ) , although the velocity offset between this and the bulge of eso 243 - 49 is @xmath13430 km / s , close to the escape velocity from the s0 galaxy ( shp13 ) .",
    "this allows to suggest that hlx-1 might be in a dwarf satellite galaxy or a star cluster near eso 243 - 49 are not than in the galaxy itself ( shp13 ) .",
    "the hii region in which the hlx is located could be the remnant of a dwarf satellite galaxy that has been accreted ( farrell et al .",
    "the optical counterpart of hlx-1 was detected in various bands , from near - infrared to far - ultraviolet ( fuv , wiersema et al . 2010 ; soria et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ; farrell et al .",
    "2012 ) , but its nature remains puzzling .",
    "cseh et al .",
    "( 2015 ) used radio observations of eso 243 - 49 hlx-1 in 2012 based on the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) .",
    "they esimated the bh mass as @xmath20 m@xmath10 .",
    "yan et al .",
    "( 2015 ) have analyzed @xmath0 monitoring observations of eso 243 - 49 hlx-1 and compared the hlx-1 outburst properties with those of bright galactic low - mass x - ray binary transients ( lmxbts ) .",
    "furthermore , they stated that hlx-1 spends progressively less time in the succeeding outburst state and much more time in quiescence , but its peak luminosity remains approximately constant .",
    "the spectral analysis by yan et al . strengthened the similarity between the state transitions in hlx-1 and those in galactic lmxbts .",
    "a very high luminosity of eso  243 - 49 hlx-1 is considered as evidence for the existence of imbh in hlx-1 ( farrell et al .",
    "however , luminosities up to @xmath1310@xmath21 erg / s can be explained by stellar - mass bhs undergoing super - eddington accretion ( see begelman 2002 ) that is followed . as a result , the apparent luminosity can exceed the eddington limit estimated for isotropic radiation ( king 2008 ; freeland et al .",
    "highly collimated sources are not expected to have a disk - blackbody or thermal - dominant spectrum , like we see in hlx-1 in the high / soft state .",
    "therefore hlx-1 may not be a strongly beamed source .",
    "consequently , luminosity above @xmath22 erg / s is difficult to explain without considering a massive bh source .",
    "generally , two scenarios for an interpretation of hlx / ulx phenomena have been proposed .",
    "first , these sources can be stellar - mass bhs ( @xmath23100 m@xmath10 ) radiating at eddington or super - eddington rates [ see e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "alternatively , they can be intermediate - mass bhs ( @xmath24100 m@xmath10 ) whose luminosities are essentially sub - eddington .",
    "the exact origin of such objects still remains uncertain , and there is still no general consensus on the causes of the poweful outbursts .",
    "recently , @xcite discussed another scenario for ulx .    using the _ nustar _ mission @xcite , bachetti and collaborators detected pulsations of x - ray emission with an average period 1.37 s modulated by a 2.5-day cycle from ulx-4 located in the nuclear region of the galaxy m82 .",
    "bachetti et al .",
    "also argued that these pulsations are results of the rotation of a magnetized neutron star , while the modulation arises from its binary orbital motion .",
    "we note that the x - ray luminosity of m82 ulx-4 is about @xmath25 erg s@xmath26 in 0.3  10 kev energy range , which suggests a luminosity @xmath27 for a 1.4 m@xmath10 neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "such a source is ten times brighter than any known accreting pulsar .",
    "the discovery of m82 ulx-4 and its possible interpretation as a ns can expand possible scenarios for ulxs .",
    "it is desirable for eso  243 - 49 hlx-1 to independently identify the bh for its central object and also determine the mass of its bh as an alternative to previously employed methods ( based on luminosity estimates alone ) .",
    "a new method for determining the bh mass was developed by shaposhnikov & titarchuk ( 2009 ) , hereafter st09 , who used a correlation scaling between x - ray spectral and timing ( or mass accretion rate ) properties observed from many galactic bh binaries during the spectral state transitions .",
    "this method has also been applied to study of another class of x - ray sources , ulxs sources , ngc 5408 x-1 ( strohmayer & mushotzky ( 2009 ) and m101 ulx-1 ( titarchuk & seifina , 2015 ) .",
    "we note , this method is commonly used for a bh mass determination of supermassive bhs , such as ngc 3227 , ngc 5548 ngc 5506 and ngc 3516 ( papadakis et al . 2009 ; sobolewska & papadakis , 2009 ) and nls1 galaxy mrk 766 ( giacche et al . 2014 ) , using a sample of galactic bhc binaries as reference sources .",
    "this scaling method can also be applied for bh mass estimates when the conventional dynamical method can not be used .",
    "we applied the st09 method to _ swift_/xrt data of eso  243 - 49 hlx-1 .",
    "previously , many properties of hlx-1 were analyzed using @xmath0/xrt observations ( e.g. , soria et al .",
    "2010 ; farrell et al . 2013",
    "; webb et al . 2014 ; yan et al . 2015 ) .",
    "in particular , soria et al .",
    "( 2010 ) assessed _ swift _",
    "( 2008  2009 ) observations by fitting their x - ray spectra .",
    "they used a few models , in particular , an additive model of the blackbody / diskbb plus power - law .",
    "they found that in these x - ray spectra the photon index changes from 1.8 to 2.95 but they were unable to present any argument that this source to be intermediate - mass bh or foreground ns .    , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , hereafter st11 , have shown that bh and ns sources can be distinguished using @xmath2-@xmath5 correlation .",
    "st11 predicted a bh source in eso  243 - 49 hlx-1 and ruled out a quiescent neutron star in this source . only in bh sources",
    "the photon index @xmath2 can increase from @xmath28 to @xmath29 with mass accretion rate , in contrast to neutron stars , for which we usually find the constant photon index around @xmath30 ( see e.g. st11 ) .",
    "furthermore , wiersema et al . (",
    "2010 ) measured a redshift of z=0.0223 for hlx-1 , which clearly indicates that hlx-1 can not be a neutron star ( ns ) source because its luminosity is too high for a ns . in this paper",
    "we present an analysis of available _ swift _ observations of eso  243 - 49  hlx-1 made during 2008  2015 to re - examine our previous conclusions on a bh nature of hlx-1 and to find further indications on intermediate - mass bh in hlx-1 . in sect .",
    "2 we present the list of observations used in our data analysis , while in sect .",
    "3 we provide details of the x - ray spectral analysis .",
    "we discuss the evolution of the x - ray spectral properties during the high - low state transitions and present the results of the scaling analysis to estimate the bh mass of eso  243 - 49  hlx-1 in sect .",
    "4 . we conclude on our results in sect .",
    "we used @xmath0 data @xcite of eso  243 - 49 hlx-1 carried out from 2008 to 2015 . in table 1",
    "we show the summary of the _",
    "swift_/xrt @xcite observations . in the swift observations , hlx-1 has been detected , at least , at @xmath13 2-@xmath31 significance ( see , evans et al .",
    "the @xmath0-xrt / pc data ( obsids , indicated in the first column of table 1 ) were processed using the hea - soft v6.14 , the tool xrtpipeline v0.12.84 and the calibration files ( latest caldb version is 20150721 ) .",
    "the ancillary response files were created using xrtmkarf v0.6.0 and exposure maps were generated by xrtexpomap v0.2.7 .",
    "we fitted the spectrum using the response file swxpc0to12s6@xmath3220010101v012.rmf .",
    "we also applied the online xrt data product generator for an independent check of light curves and spectra ( including background and ancillary response files , see evans et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) .",
    "we also identified the state using the hardness ( color ) ratio ( hr ) ( see sect .",
    "3.2 ) and the bayesian method developed by park et al .",
    "moreover , we applied an effective area option of the park s code which includes the count - rate correction factors in their calculations .",
    "our results , obtained by adapting this technique , indicate a continuous distribution of the hr with source intensity from a high hardness ratio at lower count - rate to a low hardness ratio at higher count events ( see figure [ hid ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the hardness@xmath1intensity diagram shows a smooth track .",
    "therefore , we grouped the @xmath0 spectra into seven bands according to count rates ( see sect .",
    "3.1 ) and fitted the combined spectra of each band using the xspec package [ version 12.8.14 , see @xcite ] .",
    "in addition , all groups of the _ swift _ spectra were binned to a minimum of 20 counts per bin in order to use @xmath33 statistics for our spectral fitting .",
    "we also employed _ chandra _ data for more deep image analysis .",
    "specifically , we investigated an observation of hlx-1 for which the hrc - i camera was operated on the board of _ chandra _ with the ciao v4.1.1 task wavdetect .",
    "we visually inspected the source field - of - view ( fov ) image to exclude a possible contamination from nearby sources . to do this",
    ", we implemented the @xmath34 image which has a better resolution than the _ swift _ image . in figure  [ imageb ]",
    "we show the adaptively smoothed @xmath34/hrc - i ( 0.1  10 kev ) image of the eso  243 - 49 hlx-1 field , obtained on 2009 july 4 with an exposure of 1175 s ( obsid : 10919 ) when eso  24349 hlx1 was in quiescence ( see see also blue dashed vertical line in figure  [ lc ] which indicates the @xmath34/hrc - i observational mjd point in the lightcurve ) .",
    "two sources were detected in the fov near hlx1 position : 2xmm j011050.4 - 460013 and 2xmm j010953.9 - 455538 . a source related to the position of hlx-1 ( webb et al .",
    "2010 ) is 2xmm j010953.9 - 455538 , identified as eso 243 - 49 hlx-1 ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , j2000.0 and indicated by yellow circle in figure  [ imageb ] ) . to separate x - ray emissions from these two sources and minimize contamination of eso 24349 hlx1 by the nearby source we additionally used specific swift pointing ( see dashed circle in figure  [ imageb ] ) ,",
    "within which only hlx1 is detected . in figure  [ imageb ]",
    "the large circles ( labeled nominal and offset ) show the two pointing positions used to extract hlx1 data for the swift observations . in this way , we compared the relative contributions of these two sources throughout all swift observations .",
    "for the observations made at the offset pointing positions , the count rates are almost the same as that made at the nominal pointing position .",
    "thus , we conclude that during swift observations this nearby source remains faint in comparison with the variable hlx1 .      before we proceed with details of the spectral fitting we study the hardness ratio ( hr ) . in application to the _ swift _ data we considered the hr is a ratio of the hard and soft counts in the 1.5  10 kev and 0.3  1.5 kev bands , respectively .",
    "the hr is evaluated by calculating the background counting . in figure",
    "[ hid ] we show the hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) and thus , we show that the different count - rate observations are assocated with different color regimes : the higher hr values correspond to harder spectra .",
    "a bayesian approach was used to estimate the hr values and their errors  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ hid ] indicates that the hr monotonically reduces with the total count rate ( 0.3  10 kev ) .",
    "this particular sample is similar to those of most of outbursts of galactic x - ray binary transients ( see belloni et al . 2006 ; homan et al . 2001 ; shaposhnikov & titarchuk , 2006 ; st09 ; ts09 ; shrader et al . 2010 ; mu@xmath37oz - darias et al . 2014 ) .",
    "six recurring outbursts occurred in hlx-1 during the _ swift _ monitoring ( from 2008 up to now ) .",
    "these outbursts were approximately separated by one year apart .",
    "we show the _",
    "swift_/xrt light curve of eso  243 - 49 hlx-1 during 2008  2015 for the 0.3  10 kev band in figure  [ lc ] .",
    "red points indicate the source signal and green points correspond to the background level .",
    "we found six outbursts of eso  243 - 49 hlx-1 peaked at mjd=55060 , 55446 , 55791 , 56178 , 56586 and 57060 with a fred profile and rough duration from 70 to 200 days .",
    "for the remaining _ swift _ observations the source were in the low state .",
    "unfortunately , individual _",
    "swift_/xrt observations of eso  243 - 49 hlx-1 in photon counting ( pc ) mode do not have enough counts in order to make statistically significant spectral fits .",
    "we studied the _ swift_/xrt hid ( see figure  [ hid ] ) and grouped the observations into seven bands : very low ( a , hr@xmath241 ; b , 0.5@xmath23hr<1 ) , low ( c , 0.25@xmath380.6 ) , intermediate ( d , 0.13@xmath380.25 ) , high ( e , 0.07@xmath380.13 ; f , 0.03@xmath380.07 ) and very high ( g , hr@xmath230.03 ) count rates to resolve this difficult problem . to do this ,",
    "we have combined the spectra in each related band , regrouping them with the task grppha and then fitted them using the 0.3  10 kev range .",
    "different spectral models were used in order to test them for all available data for eso  243 - 49 hlx-1 .",
    "we wish to establish the low / hard and high / soft state evolution using these spectral models .",
    "we investigated the combined @xmath0 spectra to test the following spectral models : powerlaw , blackbody , bmc and their possible combinations modified by an absorption model . to fit all of these spectra",
    ", we used a neutral column , which was obtained by the best - fit column @xmath39 of @xmath40 @xmath41 ( see also yan et al .",
    "2015 ; farrell et al .",

    "2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "the phabs*power - law model fits the low state data well [ e.g. , for band - a spectrum , @xmath42=1.15 ( 138 d.o.f . ) , see the top of table  2 ] .",
    "as we established this power - law model indicates to very large photon indices ( greater than 3 , particularly for band - g spectrum , see figure [ hid ] ) and moreover , this model has unacceptable fit quality , @xmath33 for all d , e , f and g - spectra of @xmath0 data",
    ". for the high - state data , the thermal model ( blackbody ) provides better fits than the power - law model .",
    "however , the intermediate state spectra ( d - spectra ) can not be fitted by any single - component model .",
    "a simple power - law model produces a soft excess .",
    "these significant positive residuals at low energies , lower than 1 kev , suggest the presence of additional emission components in the spectrum . as a result we also tested a sum of blackbody and power - law component model .",
    "the model parameters are @xmath43 @xmath41 ; @xmath44 ev and @xmath45 ( see more in table  [ tab : par_swift ] ) .",
    "the best fits of the _ swift _ spectra has been found using of the bulk motion comptonization model [ bmc xspec model , @xcite ] , for which @xmath2 ranges from 1.6 to 3.0 for all observations ( see table  [ tab : par_swift ] and figures  [ 6_swift_sp_compar]-[two_state_spectra ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that all these best - fit results are found using the same model for the high and low states .",
    "now , we briefly recall the physical picture described by the @xmath46 model , its key assumptions and parameters .",
    "the bmc comptonization spectrum is a sum of a part of the blackbody ( bb ) directly visible by the earth observer [ a fraction of @xmath47 and a fraction of the bb , @xmath48 , convolved with the comptonization green function which is , in the bmc approximation , a broken power - law .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that this comptonization green function is characterized by only one parameter , the spectral index @xmath49 .",
    "thus , as one can see that the bmc model has the main parameters , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , the seed blackbody temperature @xmath52 and the bb normalization which is proportional to the seed blackbody luminosity and inverse proportional to @xmath53 where d is a distance to the source ( see figure  [ geometry ] ) .",
    "the spectral evolution for the low / hard state - high / soft state ( lhs@xmath1hss ) transition is evident in figure  [ 6_swift_sp_compar ] .",
    "seven @xmath54 spectral diagrams related to different spectral states in hlx@xmath11 are presented there ( see also sect.[hid_lc ] and figure [ hid ] ) .",

    "the bmc normalization , @xmath56 varies by a factor of fifteen , in the range of @xmath57 erg s@xmath26 kpc@xmath58 , while the comptonized ( illumination ) fraction varies in a wide range ( @xmath59 or @xmath60 ) . in figure  [ two_state_spectra ]",

    "observations of many galactic bhs ( gbhs ) and their x - ray spectral analysis [ see st09 , @xcite , @xcite and sts14 ] have confirmed this prediction of tz98 . for our particular source hlx-1 , we also found that @xmath2 monotonically increased from 1.6 and then they finally saturated at a value of 3.0 ( see figure  [ saturation ] ) . using the index-@xmath5 correlation found in eso  243 - 49 hlx-1 we estimate a bh mass in this source by scaling this correlation with those detected in a number of gbhs and m101 ulx-1 ( see details below , in sect .",

    "as we have pointed out above , there are different scenarios for a ulx central source : stellar mass black hole , intermediate - mass black hole and neutron star .",
    "the ulx population may not not be homogeneous , and therefore different ulxs may be related to different origins .",

    "however , in spite of these differences and their classifications as ulxs , we can suggest a possible similarity between eso 24349 hlx1 source and m101 ulx1 and a number of gbhs in terms of their index - mass accretion rate ( @xmath2-@xmath56 ) correlations .",

    "it is worth noting that the inclination of eso  243 - 49 hlx-1 may be different from those for the reference galactic sources ( @xmath122 ) , therefore we take this bh mass estimate for eso  243 - 49 hlx-1 as the lowest bh mass value because that @xmath123 is reciprocal function of @xmath124 [ see eq .

    "it is also important to emphasize that this original mass estimate for the central source in hlx-1 , based on a particular x - ray luminosity , is consistent with our scaling bh mass estimate for hlx-1 .",
    "in addition , our hlx-1 mass estimate is also consistent with an imbh mass of @xmath128 m@xmath10 derived using a detailed x - ray spectral modelling ( farrell et al .",

    "our luminosity estimate agrees with that previously obtained for hlx-1 with different instruments ( see farrell et al . 2009 ; godet et al .",
    "2009 ; yan et al . 2015 ) .",
    "however , using optical observations ( fors2 spectrograph on the very large telescope ) , soria et al .",
    "( 2013 ) found that the h@xmath19 emission from hlx-1 ( @xmath133 a few times of @xmath134 erg / s ) could be excited by x - ray luminosity of @xmath135 erg / s , which is an order of magnitude smaller than the mean luminosity observed over 2009  2012 .",
    "soria et al . suggested that the observed @xmath136 emission comes not from the disk surface ( it does not have a disk - like profile ) but from some material further out , or perhaps from the remnants of previous outflows .",
    "now we discuss some potential sources of systematic errors which can affect the validity of our method .",
    "this similarity is based on comparative analysis of spectral properties for these two classes of objects that are revealed during x - ray outbursts ( see sect .",
    "[ hid_lc ] ) .",
    "in particular , we clearly observe softening of x - ray emission with x - ray outburst flux in hlx1 ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ hid ] ) , which is similar to that in the bright galactic low - mass x - ray binaries .    the hardness - intensity diagram shown in fig .",

    "we demonstrate that spectra of hlx1 are poorly fitted by _",
    "power - law , bbody _ models and their combination ( see table  [ tab : par_swift ] ) .",
    "the detailed modeling of x - ray spectral shape reveals a strong rise of the low - energy component ( for photon energies less than 1 kev ) along with a steepening of the higher energy tail during outburst development .",
    "this observational effect is a strong confirmation of the converging inflow paradigm in the case of a bh source [ see @xcite ] .      in this paper , we used galactic x - ray binaries to compare their spectral characteristic with those established in eso 24349 hlx1 .",
    "we used xte j1550564 for which the mass of compact object ( bh ) is evaluated applying `` gold standard '' dynamical measurements ( orosz , 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , bh mass scaling for a pair of eso 24349 hlx1 and xte j1550564 provides a reliable bh mass estimate for eso 24349 hlx1 .",
    "however , the bh mass values of other objects used for scaling procedure , such as 4u  163047 , h  1743322 , are not based on dynamical measurements and can not be considered as `` traditional '' bh estimates .",

    "1743322 well agrees with that applying bh mass of xte j1550564 .",
    "we used the extragalactic source m101 ulx1 for a bh mass estimate in eso 24349 .",

    "2004 ; kong & di stefano , 2005 ; ts16 ) and optical data ( liu et al .",

    "( 2013 ) estimated mass of the compact object as 5  1000 m@xmath10 .",
    "we note that liu et al .",
    "( 2013 ) made this bh mass estimate based on radial velocity analysis and adopted a simple two - point mass model for a binary without taking into account a tidal influence and a heating effect to the optical star by the x - ray companion , which can significantly change the resulting bh mass value @xcite .",
    "this shows a tendency for smaller values of bh mass , @xmath140 using optical data and higher values @xmath141 when x - ray data are used .",
    "we estimated the bh mass in eso 24349 , @xmath142 m@xmath10 by applying the scaling technique with x - ray mass @xmath141 ( @xmath143 m@xmath10 , see ts16 ) .",
    "when we applied an optical bh mass estimate @xmath140 ( @xmath144 m@xmath10 ) , we found lower masses within a wide interval of from 7 m@xmath10 to @xmath145 m@xmath10 for @xmath146 which is inconsistent with so called fundamental plane results @xmath147 m@xmath10 ( see davis et al . 2011 and godet et al . 2011 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that our scaling method applied to the pair of bh sources eso 24349 and m101 ulx1 leads to better constraints with the case of the x - ray bh mass than that of optical bh mass .",
    "we note that the massive bhs in eso 24349 and m101 ulx1 are not located in galactic nuclei as it should be in the case of supermassive bhs ( smbhs ) .",
    "as is known , the stellar bulge of almost every massive galaxy contains a smbh ( ferrarese & ford 2000 ) .",
    "when galaxies merge they can form two or more smbhs with their stellar bulges which are outside of the galactic centre . following a merger , a pair of inspiraling smbhs can remain for a while in separation before forming a tight binary or finally merge ( see begelman et al .",
    "similarly , the high mass of some imbhs can be formed as a result of merging of galaxy nuclei .",
    "this scenario can be a valid argument for large masses in m101 ulx1 and eso 24349 .",
    "there are still many open quiestions from a theoretical point of view how to explain a formation of massive bhs ( such as imbhs ) .",
    "recently , latif & ferrara ( 2016 ) discussed possible formation mechanisms of supermassive bhs .",
    "in particular , they suggested that `` seed '' bhs were formed early on , and grow either through rapid accretion or bh / galaxy mergers .",
    "latif & ferrara offered three most popular bh formation scenarios : dynamical evolution of dense nuclear star clusters , a core - collapse of massive stars , and a collapse of a protogalactic metal free gas cloud .",
    "we included m101 ulx1 in a scaling bh mass sample for eso 24349 , even though soria & kong ( 2016 ) presented strong arguments that the observed emission in m101 ulx1 is not a classic accretion disk .",
    "specifically , soria & kong re - examined the x - ray spectral and timing properties of m101 ulx1 using a series of @xmath34 and xmm-@xmath137 observations and showed that their model of an optically thick outflow is consistent with the data .",
    "they showed that the characteristic radius , @xmath77 of a thermal emitter and its color temperature , @xmath148 are approximately related to each other as @xmath149 .",
    "in addition , they revealed absorption edges fitting the m101 ulx1 spectra applying thermal plasma models .",
    "they interpreted this modeling along with the data as an evidence of a clumpy , multi - temperature outflow around ulx1 , in particularly in the hss .",
    "soria & kong highlighted that m101 ulx1 belongs to ultraluminous supersoft sources ( ulss ) rather than to ulx population .",
    "it might therefore be argued that if soria & kong are correct then the method of the bh mass determination applied here might not be applicable for m101 ulx1 .",
    "our arguments which are based on the correlation of the photon index with the mass accretion rate in m101 ulx1 and its resemblance with those in a number of galactic sources allow us argue that the innermost part of the accretion flow ( the disk - compton cloud - converging flow configuration ) is similar in these sources ( see ts16 and fig .",
    "[ geometry ] here ) .",
    "moreover , this index - mass accretion rate correlation for m101 ulx-1 is almost identical in terms of the shape for that in eso 24349 hlx1 and those in the chosen galactic bhs .",
    "it is not by chance that we compared all these correlations with each other and found that they are self - similar .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that @xcite described the hard tail of the _ chandra _ ulx spectrum of m101 ulx-1 using higher temperatures .",
    "they revealed a relatively hard tail in the 0.3  6 kev energy range and applied three _",
    "components in addition to sample a soft blackbody component .",
    "the high count - rate spectra of three of these _ mekal _ components are associated with temperatures of 0.6 kev , 1 kev and @xmath1502 kev . however , when soria & kong replaced this multiple component model by the single @xmath151  @xcite component ( see table a3 there ) , they also obtained a good quality fit with the seed photon temperatures in the range of 90  135 ev .",
    "we found the low@xmath1high state transitions observed in hlx-1 using the full set of @xmath0-/xrt observations ( 2008  2015 ) and we showed the observed spectra can be fitted by the bmc model for all observations , independently of the spectral state of the source .",
    "we investigated the x - ray outburst properties of hlx-1 and confirmed the presence of spectral state transitions during the outbursts using of hardness - intensity diagrams ( godet et al .",
