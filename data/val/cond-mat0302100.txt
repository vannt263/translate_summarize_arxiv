    "recent conductance data of nanocontacts and break junctions in magnetic transition metals such as ni have shown interesting and partly unexpected results . while early conductance histograms for ni at room temperature in air appeared basically structureless @xcite , oshima et al .",
    "@xcite , who worked in vacuum , at variable temperature , and with the possibility of a magnetic field , found a minimal conductance step preferentially near 2 and 4 ( in units of @xmath0 , the conductance quantum per spin ) at rt and zero field , near 4 at 770 k and zero field , and near 3 ( occasionally near 1 ) at rt with a field .",
    "ono et al .",
    "@xcite , reported again 2 for ni in zero field , and 1 for ni in a field .",
    "break junction data by yanson @xcite show a minimal conductance step of about 3.2 in zero field . despite the poor consistency between these data ,",
    "it is clear that the lowest conductance step for a ni nanocontact is anomalously small in comparison with the large expected number of @xmath1 conducting channels , of the order of at least 8 @xcite for a monatomic contact .    in a previous paper @xcite we investigated the possibility that the smallness of the last conductance step observed for",
    "a ni nanocontact may be caused by the fact that two tips are magnetized in different directions forming a magnetization reversal ( or domain wall ) precisely in the contact region . by replacing the contact with a monatomic infinite tipless ni wire we found that the number of conducting channels ( energy bands crossing the fermi level ) can be significantly reduced from 8 ( nonmagnetic wire ) or 7 ( ferromagnetic wire ) to 2 as a magnetization reversal",
    "is built into the wire .",
    "the two remaining conducting channels correspond to light @xmath2electrons , while the heavy @xmath3electrons are confined in the regions of positive and negative magnetization and can not propagate along the wire due to the magnetization reversal .",
    "the real nanocontact consisting of two macroscopic tips and an atomic contact region is an open quantum system and has no artificial periodic conditions such as those in ref.@xcite .",
    "the influence of the tips themselves ( not considered in the previous model ) will be in general important for the nanocontact conductance .",
    "so , in order to make quantitative conductance predictions one will need to adopt a more detailed approach comprising two semi - infinite metals ( either thick wires or semi - infinite crystals ) connected by a neck ( a short monatomic wire , or just a single atom ) .",
    "several theoretical methods are available to study the transport properties of atomic scale conductors . among these are methods based on nonequilibrium green s functions combined with a localized basis set @xcite .",
    "the landauer - buttiker formula provides another simple way to calculate the conductance of quantum systems connected to two tips .",
    "the conductance is expressed in terms of the transmission coefficient at the fermi level @xmath4 . in order to compute the transmission coefficient",
    "one must solve a scattering problem for the open quantum system .",
    "the scattering approach has been applied by lang and co - workers @xcite , and tsukada and co - workers@xcite using the jellium model for the electrodes .",
    "the layer kkr approach has been used to study the spin - dependent tunneling in magnetic tunnel junctions @xcite .",
    "lately wortmann and co - workers@xcite have formulated the transfer matrix approach based on computation of single - electron green function in the linearized augmented plane wave ( lapw ) basis .",
    "we are interested in a formulation based on plane waves and ultrasoft pseudopotentials , a calculational technology which we are applying to other problems involving transition metals @xcite with great potential for the future .",
    "recently choi and ihm @xcite presented a first - principles plane wave based solution to the scattering problem with real atomic contacts incorporating the kleinman - bylander - type pseudopotentials .",
    "we wish to generalize this scheme to deal with ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite which adequately describe the nuclei and core electrons of a transition metal such as ni .",
    "the first step , on which we focus in this paper is the complex band structure of periodic system , consisting of both propagating and exponentially decaying evanescent states .",
    "these generalized bloch states will be needed to construct the scattering state deep inside the tips .",
    "the evanescent states play a significant role in contact , surface or interface phenomena where there is a breaking of translational symmetry in one direction .",
    "we present here the complex band structure of bulk ni ( which gives information on the nanocontact tips ) and of a monatomic ni wire ( the junction between the two tips ) .",
    "although this is clearly only the first step towards a full theoretical description of the nanocontact conductivity , we shall see that some insight can be obtained already by examining the complex bands .",
    "the importance of complex band structure for conductance predictions has been recently emphasized for magnetic tunnel junctions @xcite and molecular systems @xcite .",
    "we consider an open quantum system divided into three regions : left bulk contact ( @xmath5 ) , scattering region ( @xmath6 ) and right bulk contact ( @xmath7 ) and we use a supercell geometry in the @xmath8 direction perpendicular to the wire .",
    "a wave propagating at energy @xmath9 with @xmath10 and incident from the left contact on the scattering region will form a scattering state @xmath11 which due to the supercell geometry has a bloch form in the @xmath8 direction : @xmath12 different @xmath13 do not mix and can be considered separately . if there is no coupling between different spin polarizations in the hamiltonian the same conclusion is valid also for the spin index @xmath14 and we can omit both @xmath15 and @xmath14 from the following formulas .    deep within the contacts the system becomes periodic also along the @xmath16 direction and one can determine generalized bloch states with complex @xmath17 vector which obey to the periodic condition : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the length of the periodic unit cell deep within the contacts . in this region the scattering state @xmath11 can be written as a combination of propagating and evanescent generalized bloch states :",
    "@xmath20 where summation over @xmath21 includes the generalized bloch states in the left ( right ) contact at energy @xmath9 which propagate or decay to the left ( right ) . in the @xmath8 plane",
    "the wave functions @xmath22 obey the same bloch condition as in eq.([uno ] ) .",
    "thus to compute the transmission and reflection coefficients @xmath23 one will need to find the complex band structure and generalized bloch states @xmath24 in the metallic contacts at the chosen energy @xmath9 .",
    "we determine here the complex band structure within density functional theory ( dft ) describing the atoms with ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite .",
    "we consider the generalized bloch states which satisfy the single - particle kohn - sham equation @xcite ( atomic units @xmath25 are used ) : @xmath26\\ket{\\psi_k},\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the effective local potential ( see ref .",

    "if one considers only @xmath46 plane waves with @xmath47 the number of @xmath37 becomes finite and equals to @xmath48 . as in ref.@xcite to find the functions @xmath37 we discretize the unit cell along the @xmath16 axis by dividing it into slices and replacing the @xmath49 in each slice by a @xmath16-independent potential .",
    "the @xmath37 in the slices will be a linear combination of two exponentials with coefficients obtained by a matching procedure .",

    "( 7 ) into eqs .",
    "( 10)-(12 ) one can show that the last three equations are equivalent to the generalized eigenvalue problem : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are matrices .",
    "we solve this problem to obtain in general a complex @xmath17 and coefficients @xmath56 for the generalized bloch state @xmath24 at a given energy @xmath9 and @xmath57 .",
    "our complex band structure calculations proceed in two steps .",
    "first we compute with a standard electronic structure code ( pwscf ) @xcite the ground state electronic structure of the system ( infinite bulk ; and , separately , infinite perfect nanowire ) and we obtain the effective local potential @xmath49 and the screened coefficients @xmath58  @xcite . in a second step , we use the potential @xmath49 and the screened coefficients @xmath58 to compute the complex band structure applying the scheme described above  @xcite .",
    "as a first example , we studied the complex band structure of ferromagnetic bulk fcc ni ( fig.1 ) . the orientation of the ni tips in the actual break junction experiments is not under control , and we have chosen to plot the complex bands appropriate for a @xmath59 orientation of the electrodes .",
    "we considered a tetragonal unit cell with two nickel atoms and the @xmath16 axis parallel to the tetragonal axis .",
    "our calculated optimal equilibrium lattice constant of ferromagnetic fcc ni is @xmath60   ( expt . @xmath61",
    " ) and this value has been used for the band structure calculation . at this volume",
    "the magnetic moment per atom is 0.59 @xmath62 ( expt .",
    "0.61 @xmath62 ) @xcite . in the scattering problem we took @xmath63 for the purpose of examplification . due to the symmetry of the hamiltonian @xcite ,",
    "if at a fixed energy @xmath9 a real @xmath17 is a solution of the problem , also @xmath64 is a solution ( corresponding to right- and left- propagating waves ) .",
    "if a complex @xmath17 is a solution also @xmath65 are solutions @xcite ( states with @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) correspond to evanescent modes decaying along the positive ( negative ) @xmath16 direction ) .",
    "we can therefore show the complex band structure just in the region @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "ni is a ferromagnetic metal and we plot in fig .",
    "1a and 1b the bands corresponding to the majority spin ( spin up ) and minority spin ( spin down ) respectively . figs .",
    "1a and 1b are divided into three panels .",
    "the propagating bands with @xmath70 and @xmath71 are plotted with continuous lines in the central panel .",
    "dotted lines in the left panel represent bands with purely imaginary @xmath17 ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "the bands which correspond to complex @xmath17 with @xmath74 and @xmath73 are represented with open circles .",
    "they are shown with two branches which correspond to their projection in the real and imaginary planes .",
    "we chose arbitrarily to plot the projection on the imaginary plane in the left or in the right part of the figure in order to improve clarity .",
    "the band structure of fcc nickel corresponding to real @xmath17 obtained with pwscf are shown in the inset of fig .  1 along the @xmath75 direction .",
    "since our cell has two atoms , the bands with real @xmath17 in fig.1 should coincide with the one in the inset after folding about the middle vertical line .",
    "we indeed found excellent agreement between the real band structures in the two calculations , with differences of the order of 0.005 ev ( invisible in the figure ) .    in the band structure of fcc",
    "ni one can identify five narrow @xmath76 bands and one broader @xmath77 band . along the @xmath59 direction the @xmath78 band mixes with the @xmath79 band .",
    "the spin up @xmath19 bands are fully occupied and only the @xmath80 band crosses the fermi level .",
    "the down spin @xmath19 bands are upshifted in energy by a calculated exchange splitting of about 0.5 ev ( exp .",
    ". therefore they are partially unoccupied and three @xmath19 states in addition to the @xmath80 state crosses the fermi level .",
    "the complex bands shown in fig.1 can be interpreted in terms of general theorems which describe their topological features @xcite .",
    "it is known that whenever a band with real @xmath17 has a local extremum there is a complex band with opposite curvature and the same symmetry which departs at the same @xmath81 at right angles from the real plane .",
    "complex @xmath17 bands are parabolic or form loops joining real bands of the same symmetry .",
    "one such loop in the complex plane joins @xmath80 bands connecting the maximum at @xmath82 ( very weakly pronounced ) with the minimum at @xmath83 . comparing the complex band structures for different spin polarizations",
    "one can notice that there are four propagating spin down bands at @xmath4 while for spin up polarization the @xmath19 bands cross the fermi level only in the imaginary plane and are therefore evanescent ( the smallest decay is @xmath84 ) .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the complex band structure for a monatomic ni wire ( @xmath85  ) . the supercell geometry and the other technical parameters used in this calculation were already discussed in ref .",
    "the bands at real @xmath17 coincide ( within 0.005 ev ) with those presented there and calculated with the pwscf code . here all the occupated real bands have maxima or minima at the zone border and the complex bands are therefore either purely imaginary ( they are shown by dots in the left panel ) or have @xmath86 ( they are shown by dots in the right panel ) .",
    "bands at imaginary @xmath17 have a parabolic dispersion except for the loop which joins @xmath87 bands . as in the case of bulk",
    "ni at the fermi energy there is only one real @xmath80 band of spin up polarization .",
    "all the @xmath19 states are decaying and the smallest decay ( @xmath87 states ) is @xmath88 . on the contrary 6 spin down bands with real @xmath17",
    "cross the fermi level and the only decaying states crossing the fermi energy have a much larger imaginary part @xmath89 .",
    "the asymmetry between energy bands at @xmath4 for different spin directions and the existence of evanescent states with long decay lengths ( small decay parameters @xmath90 ) will play an important role in transport properties of the magnetic nanocontacts .",
    "one can see , for example , that if there is no spin reversal ( two tips and the wire are magnetized in the same direction ) all propagating states coming from the bulk ni can get ( though with some reflection at the junctions ) through the wire . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is one spin reversal ( situated either on one end of the wire or in the middle ) the propagating @xmath19-states of one ni tip become decaying in another ni tip so that they will be completely blocked .",
    "the only open channels correspond to @xmath78-electrons ( this conclusion was arrived at @xcite considering a simple model of the ni nanocontact ) . and , finally , in the hypothetical case of two spin reversals ( when the wire has the opposite direction of magnetization with respect to both tips ) the @xmath19-electrons are only able to tunnel across the wire through the evanescent states .",
    "the latter have an exponential decaying form @xmath91 with the decay length @xmath92 a.u .",
    "( @xmath87 ) , 5.31 a.u .",
    "( @xmath80 ) , and 2.0 a.u .",
    "( @xmath93 ) which should be compared with the distance between atoms in the ni wire @xmath94 a.u . the shorter the wire , the larger the contribution of @xmath19-electrons to the total conductivity .",
    "this result is similar to the spin - dependent tunneling in magnetic tunnel junctions ( see @xcite ) although in our case it is not so crucial since two propagating @xmath78-channels always exist .",
    "all these ingredients will become crucial when one will solve the scattering problem in order to find the transmission coefficient .",
    "it should be emphasized that the number of propagating channels @xmath95 give the upper limit for conductivity , @xmath96 with unit transmission for all channels , while the scattering problem solution may produce very small transmission coefficients for some propagating channels .",
    "the channel number @xmath95 of a thick wire will diverge proportional to the wire cross section , realizing the perfect conductance expected for a macroscopic case .",
    "we are working to generalize to magnetic transition metals the approach proposed by choi and ihm for calculating the ballistic conductance of open quantum systems within the landauer - buttiker theory . in this paper we focused on the complex band structure of periodic systems , which is the key ingredient for the wave - function matching between the scattering region and the metallic electrodes .",
    "the method has been implemented for the first time with ultrasoft pseudopotentials and plane waves in a dft - lsda ab - initio scheme .",
    "we showed that it can be applied to both the bulk solid and to the idealized monatomic nanowire .",
    "as a first application we calculated the complex band structure of fcc ni and of a ferromagnetic ni monoatomic wire and discussed qualitatively the properties of a nickel nanocontact which can be inferred from the complex band structure .",
