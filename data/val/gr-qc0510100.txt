    "investigations of the different aspects of quantum field theory in spaces with non - trivial topology @xcite may be interesting for several reasons . first , it is a possibility that the early universe was in fact multiply connected , so the combined effect of topology and curvature is likely to have been of considerable importance in the early stages of the evolution of the universe .",
    "second , in theories with extra dimensions such as the well known kaluza - klein theory , extra dimensions may need to be compactified providing the space with non - trivial topology .",
    "furthermore field theory in spaces with non - trivial topology ( the one - torus compactified space ) is quite similar to the field theory at non - zero temperature .",
    "the casimir effect on spaces with non - trivial topology has been investigated in different contexts ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most of the previous studies are concerned with one compact dimension ( representing imaginary time or a compact spatial dimension ) in either a curved or flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "the issue of obtaining the right order of magnitude for the possible contribution of the casimir energy density to the cosmological constant , corresponding to a free scalar field , is considered in toroidal universes with @xmath0 large and @xmath1 small dimensions @xcite .",
    "since the vacuum polarization appears in manifolds with non - trivial topologies as well as in bounded domains with boundary conditions , the question of the definition of the vacuum energy is a most fundamental one in any quantum field theory . on the other hand",
    "imposing ( mathematical ) boundary conditions on physical quantum fields turns out to be a highly non - trivial act .",
    "the difference between the zero - point energies corresponding to the scalar field when boundary condition is enforced and that in the absence of any boundary condition , diverges as the boundary is approached .",
    "integrating over all space yields an infinite vacuum energy per unit area of the boundary surface . since the infinite terms do not depend on the distance between the plates , these divergences do not usually show up in the calculation of casimir force . to obtain the finite results through the use of a suitable regularization",
    ", many efforts have been done to identify and separate the singularities by physically meaningful cutoffs @xcite .",
    "the whole argument is based on boundaries that constrain _ all _ modes of the fluctuating field , introducing divergences into physical observables .",
    "therefore one needs a realistic boundary condition through a high energy cutoff that limits the fluctuations and thereby introduces a high energy scale into the theory .",
    "modes with energy below this scale obey a boundary condition while modes with energies at or above this scale do not .",
    "hence the boundary condition applies to the physics at energies much lower than this scale where there is no need to reference the scale , as it was the case in the casimir s original problem . in this paper",
    "we examine the casimir - type effects in four dimensional spacetimes with @xmath2 topology , using an approach introduced recently @xcite for an approximate calculation of casimir energy in generic geometries like the casimir pendulum and a sphere opposite a plane .",
    "although an approximation , it leads to exact results for flat geometries .",
    "it is specially useful when the normal modes can not be determined .",
    "the basic idea is to employ the regularization method of _ point splitting _ through an expansion of the casimir energy in terms of the classified , closed geodesic paths and then identify those classes that contribute to the casimir effect .",
    "the expansion is given in terms of the lengths of the paths and the paths with zero - length ( corresponding to the high frequency components of the field ) introduce divergences as they only probe the geometry in the immediate vicinity of the spacetime point of interest and in this restricted neighbourhood the topology does not change .",
    "+ including a massive field in the casimir energy calculations is the simplest generalization of the usual , massless scalar field calculations .",
    "casimir - type effects in the presence of massive fields have been studied in @xcite and @xcite for both scalar and spinor fields . there",
    "it has been found that a non - zero field mass always decreases the magnitude of the energy density . here",
    "we will encounter cases in which massive fields act in the opposite direction .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows , in sec .",
    "ii the stress - energy tensor is written in terms of the trace of the hadamard function which is the basic object from which @xmath3 is constructed by differentiation .",
    "we will review the casimir energy calculations between parallel plates as an example of the use of the optical approach in section iii .",
    "some applications of this approach in flat four dimensional manifolds , either orientable or non - orientable , are studied in section iv .",
    "divergences due to the massive fields at low and high temperature limit are also discussed in this section .",

    "following casimir s original prediction for the force between grounded conducting plates , many other calculations have been carried out for different variations in the conductor geometry or background @xcite and many exact and approximate techniques have been proposed to calculate this energy . here as the main objective , employing the recently proposed optical approach , we calculated the casimir energy for massive fields in a cylindrical topology as well as on a mobius strip as a non - orientable manifold .",
    "the simplification provided by this approach allows the extension of the domain of applicability to the calculation of the regularized vacuum energy of a quantum field subjected to various static external conditions . applying this approach to systems at finite temperature , the finite temperature effect on the free energy of a cavity",

    "the same approach has also been applied to calculate the casimir energy for spinors and twisted fields , where it is shown that different paths contribute with non - equal weight factors . using the same approach we have recovered the well known fact that the dependence of free energy on mass at high and low temperatures may be regarded as problematic since the key feature here is the presence of a divergent term which is absent in the massless case . as a consequence",
    "the contribution of massive fields in these regimes not only does not tend to damp relative to their massless counterparts ( as in the @xmath164 case ) but also diverges .",
