    "the birth of _ spintronics _ can be dated back to the discovery of the _ giant magnetoresistance _ effect in 1988.@xcite since then , many theoretical and experimental studies on spin - dependent electronic transport have been performed in order to achieve a clear understanding of the underlying physics and to investigate the possibility of fabricating spintronic devices.@xcite one manifest realization of such a device is a quantum wire with parameters which can be tuned by a set of gate electrodes such that the transport of electrons with a certain spin direction is favored .",
    "the original proposal by datta and das@xcite is to use the spin precession in a narrow - gap semiconductor wire with spin - orbit coupling between two magnetized leads to modulate the current .",
    "however , strda and sba came up with an idea of obtaining spin polarization in a ( almost ) nonmagnetic system .",
    "they considered transport through an _",
    "quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum wire with rashba spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) , a magnetic field in the direction of the propagation as well as a potential step.@xcite in their setup , leads with negligible soi and vanishing magnetic field as present in any experimental realization were not taken into account .",
    "the goal of the present work is twofold .",
    "we _ first _ investigate , under which conditions spin - polarized currents through a _ finite length _",
    "1d wire with soi and parallel magnetic field can be achieved , if the coupling to two semi - infinite _ leads _ is included .",
    "we study the influence of a potential step and a localized impurity .",
    "such inhomogeneities play an important role for the spin polarization .    in the datta - das setup as well as in the system suggested by strda and",
    "sba the spin dependent transport properties heavily rely on the strictly 1d nature of the quantum wire with only one partially filled subband . already in the presence of a few filled subbands the control over the spin ceases.@xcite in a few hundred nanometers long strictly 1d wires the coulomb repulsion of electrons",
    "is expected to have a dramatic effect on the physics .",
    "such systems can not be described by fermi liquid theory . instead , the low - energy properties are captured by the _ luttinger liquid _",
    "phenomenology.@xcite one can thus expect that electron correlations will also affect the performance of spintronic devices made of 1d wires.@xcite in particular , local inhomogeneities , which are important to achieve controllable spin polarization in the strda and sba setup , strongly suppress the conductance in luttinger liquids.@xcite it is thus mandatory to investigate how the spin polarization is affected by luttinger liquid physics .",
    "this is the _ second _ goal of our work . a first step in analyzing the performance of the strda and sba spin filter in the presence of the electron - electron interaction",
    "was taken in ref .  .",
    "standard methods such as the self - consistent hartree - fock approximation do not capture the luttinger liquid physics of our setup and are known to lead to severe artifacts if being applied to low - dimensional electron systems with coulomb interaction .",
    "we therefore use an approximation which is based on the functional renormalization group ( frg ) approach to treat the two - particle interaction in a model hamiltonian . in the absence of soi , it was shown to be a reliable tool to calculate the linear conductance of inhomogeneous quantum wires for weak to intermediate interactions.@xcite    we show that for vanishing two - particle interaction spin polarized currents can be obtained using a similar mechanism as in ref .  , even in the presence of nonmagnetic leads with vanishing soi and zero magnetic field .",
    "we then include the coulomb interaction in our analysis .",
    "we first consider short wires ( several tens of nanometers ) in which luttinger liquid physics does not become apparent and investigate how the spin polarization is affected by the two - particle interaction .",
    "we find that it strongly modifies the energy regime ( energy of the incoming particles ) in which spin polarization can be achieved .",
    "next , the focus is on system sizes for which luttinger liquid behavior is apparent in the absence of soi ( wires of several hundreds of nanometers ) . in particular , we analyze if the spin polarization of an inhomogeneous wire is suppressed as a function of an infrared energy scale .",
    "we find that although the total conductance shows a power - law suppression in the presence of soi ( similar to the situation with vanishing soi ) the polarization _ does not _ follow such a scaling law .",
    "we present indications that the degree of spin polarization in the presence of coulomb interaction might even exceed the one obtained for vanishing two - particle interaction .",
    "while in most studies on spintronic devices the correlations are neglected even if the suggested setups contain 1d quantum wires our results clearly reveal the importance of the two - particle coulomb interaction in the spin filter suggested in ref .  .",
    "we here refrain from making direct contact to existing or future experiments as we are mainly interested in studying the basic physics within a simplified model .",
    "it must certainly be extended to be considered realistic .",
    "however , our parameters are taken from a physically sensible range ( see below ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce our setup and lattice model .",
    "the techniques to obtain the linear conductance are described in sect .",
    "[ method ] . in sect .",
    "[ results ] , we first present our results for spin - polarized transport at vanishing two - particle interaction in the presence of leads .",
    "we next include the coulomb interaction and study its interplay with the soi , the magnetic field , and external potentials .",
    "our results are summed up in sect .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "the two prototypical experimental systems for strictly 1d quantum transport are carbon nanotubes and confined electron gases which form at the interface of properly designed semiconductor heterostructures . in the latter , the confining potential generically leads to a sizable soi and these are the type of systems we have in mind in the following .",
    "but also in the former the soi seems to be surprisingly large.@xcite we choose our coordinate system such that the heterostructure confines the two - dimensional electron gas in @xmath0-direction and the external potential results in a confinement of the electrons in @xmath1-direction .",
    "therefore , the electrons are able to move in @xmath2-direction only . since we assume the confinement to be very sharp ,",
    "the different electronic subbands will be well separated . for a sufficiently low electron density",
    ", we can thus focus on the lowest subband and neglect any subband mixing .",
    "the sharp confinement leads to large electric fields , which induce a spin - orbit coupling@xcite @xmath3 \\label{h_so}\\ ] ] with the electric field @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the electron charge ) being the gradient of the ambient potential . for the 1d infinite noninteracting continuum model ( 1d electron gas ) ,",
    "soi results in a horizontal splitting of the quadratic electron energy dispersion @xmath6 with wave number @xmath7 and @xmath8 being an additional quantum number . within a certain parameter regime a magnetic field in @xmath2-direction , which couples to the electron spin ,",
    "leads to a deformation of the lower parabolic branch resulting in a double well form ( see the low - energy region of the two central dispersions of fig .  [ system_leads ] ) .",
    "moreover , it was shown in ref .   and",
    "extensively discussed in ref .   that the spin expectation values become @xmath7-dependent and display a rich behavior in the presence of both soi and magnetic field .",
    "applying an additional step - like potential and considering electrons with energy in regions of only double degeneracy leads to the above mentioned spin - polarized transport.@xcite      the starting point of our investigation is a 1d noninteracting tight - binding lattice hamiltonian .",
    "as our single - particle basis , we choose wannier states @xmath9 with @xmath10 labeling the lattice site and @xmath11 denoting the spin . the spin quantization is chosen along the @xmath0-direction .",

    "the total hamiltonian of the quantum wire is given by @xmath31    at the sites @xmath32 and @xmath33 the 1d wire is ( end-)coupled to two semi - infinite leads . having in mind a possible experimental realization , we assume that the soi in the leads is weak and can be neglected .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic field is restricted to the wire region .",
    "we assume that after entering the leads the electrons are independent ( fermi liquid behavior in higher - dimensional systems ) . for a local lead - wire coupling and in the low - energy limit , only the leads density of states at the end of the leads and at the chemical potential @xmath34 ( energy of incoming electrons ) matters . for simplicity ,",

    "this will be done in order to prevent any unwanted electron backscattering from the contacts and is reminiscent of the gradual confinement to the 1d geometry in heterostructures .",
    "we emphasize that the precise shape of the weight function with which the couplings are turned on and off does not have any significant effect on the results as long as it is sufficiently smooth . in the bulk of the wire , these parameters reach constant values ( for details , see below ) .",

    "one obtains an infinite hierarchy of coupled differential equations for the vertex functions by differentiating the generating functional with respect to @xmath66 and expanding it in powers of the external fields . to obtain a manageable set of flow equations , this hierarchy must be truncated .",

    "for the extended hubbard model and vanishing soi , this has been done in ref .",

    "if one is interested in the behavior of correlation functions to leading order in the interaction , the flow of the vertex can then be neglected altogether .",
