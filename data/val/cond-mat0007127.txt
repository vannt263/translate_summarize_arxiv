    "the spectral properties of the incidence matrix of random graphs have motivated a large number of studies over the last decades .",
    "the same problem is described under rather different names , depending upon the aspects that are under focus and the method of attack .",
    "the interest in this problem has several roots in physics .",
    "the replacement of complicated hamiltonians by large random matrices has proved very efficient in the analysis of the spectral properties ( culminating in level spacing distributions ) of large nuclei since the pioneering works of wigner and dyson . for many properties , the details of the probabilistic laws governing",
    "the distribution of matrix elements are irrelevant , and there is a very powerful notion of universality .",
    "further motivation for considering precisely random incidence matrices comes from several systems in condensed matter physics , a good example being conductors with impurities .",
    "the pure system is modeled by a lattice , and electrons can move along bonds .",
    "impurities break bonds .",
    "so the hamiltonian can be approximated by the incidence matrix of the lattice with random bonds removed . if one considers several large samples differing by the impurity concentration @xmath6 , the following properties are observed .",
    "when @xmath6 is large , only small islands of metallic atoms exist .",
    "if @xmath6 decreases to reach a certain threshold , a large island of metallic atoms invades the system .",
    "this is classical percolation .",
    "however it is generally believed that the system remains insulating ( the wave function of the electrons are all localized ) until another threshold in the impurity concentration .",
    "then some delocalized states appear and the sample is a conductor .",
    "this is called quantum percolation , a kind of anderson ( de)localization .",
    "the analytic study of this problem on a 3d lattice with random bonds removed is very difficult , and this motivated people to look at the much simpler problem of a random graph .",
    "this forgets about the spatial structure and is a kind of mean field approximation .    in the random graph model ,",
    "the lattice is replaced by the complete graph on @xmath0 points : any two points are connected by a bond ( by an edge in the language of graph theory ) .",
    "then , bonds are randomly removed , leading to a random graph where only a fraction @xmath1 of the initial bonds remains . in the simplest case ,",
    "bonds are removed with probability @xmath7 independently of each other .",
    "the model can be made more complicated by choosing randomly a sign for each bond present in the random graph .",
    "this allows interferences if the probability amplitude for an electron moving on the random graph is the product of the signs of the visited bonds .",
    "the topology of large random graphs was investigated about four decades ago by erds and renyi  @xcite in a remarkable series of papers .",
    "the idea is to let @xmath1 vary with @xmath0 .",
    "there are quite a few different regimes .",
    "the most relevant for further physical investigations are :    * the edge - probability @xmath1 remains fixed as @xmath0 goes to infinity . *",
    "the average connectivity @xmath8 remains fixed as @xmath0 goes to infinity .    in the first case ,",
    "the infinite random graph is connected and in a precise sense two infinite random graphs of given @xmath1 are isomorphic with probability 1 .",
    "the second case exhibits a percolation transition at @xmath9 . for small @xmath10",
    "all connected components are finite , and only trees contribute to the extensive quantities .",
    "but for @xmath11 , a finite fraction of the points lies in a single connected component .",
    "as explained above , the spectral properties of the ( signed ) incidence matrix of the random graph , a symmetric matrix with @xmath12 matrix elements have a great physical interest .",
    "quite often , authors concentrate on the case when the distribution of random signs is symmetric . numerical simulations and analytic ( mostly supersymmetric ) methods have given a great amount of information .",
    "for large @xmath0 , fixed @xmath1 and symmetric random signs , it is known that the spectral distribution is a semicircle  @xcite and that the level correlations are those of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , one of the four standard universality classes governing random spectra  @xcite .",
    "the finite connectivity limit has also attracted a lot of attention , under the names of dilute or sparse random matrices .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that there is some value @xmath13 for which delocalized eigenstates appear .",
    "so this simple model is believed to exhibit a quantum percolation transition .",
    "our aim in this paper is to use combinatorial methods to compute explicitly moments of the spectral distribution for given @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and in the finite connectivity limit .",
    "section 2 gives a formal definition of the model and recalls some of its topological properties .",
    "section 3 gives the enumerative algorithm for moments as polynomials in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "section 4 concentrates on the fixed @xmath1 large @xmath0 limit , first numerically ( spectrum and level spacing ) and then analytically .",
    "section 5 deals with the finite connectivity large @xmath0 limit , starting with numerical computations .",
    "in particular , we observe a quantitative change in the spectrum near the eigenvalue @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "we give qualitative arguments for the presence , location and size of delta peaks in the spectrum .",
    "then we derive a formal expression for the moment generating function and give a recursion relation for the moments , that we use to control their growth . in an appendix",
    ", we show how our algorithms can be extended when the incidence matrix is replaced by the laplacian matrix of a random graph .",
    "for @xmath16 , we define the sample space @xmath17 as follows : the elements of @xmath17 are the symmetric @xmath18 matrices @xmath19}$ ] , with @xmath20 on the diagonal and @xmath21 or 1 for @xmath22 .",
    "so @xmath17 is a discrete space consisting of @xmath23 points .",
    "we observe that @xmath17 is in one to one correspondence with the set of labeled _ simple _ graphs on @xmath0 vertices : to @xmath24 , we associate the graph with vertex set @xmath25 and edge set @xmath26",
    ". then @xmath27 is just the number of edges of the graph associated to @xmath28 . the word _",
    "simple _ above refers to the fact that the graphs we consider do not contain multiple edges or edges with only one vertex . in the sequel",
    ", graph always means simple graph , and we talk indiscriminately of matrices or associated graphs .    for any @xmath29",
    "$ ] we turn @xmath17 into a probability space : the weight of @xmath24 is @xmath30 . to rephrase this formal definition ,",
    "the entries of @xmath28 above the main diagonal are independent random variables with the same bernoulli ( binomial ) distribution : for @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( or equivalently the vertices @xmath33 and @xmath34 are connected by an edge ) with probability @xmath1 and @xmath35 with probability @xmath7 .",
    "the quantity @xmath36 appears as the average connectivity , i.e. the average number of vertices @xmath34 connected by an edge @xmath37 to a given vertex @xmath33 .",
    "remark that this connectivity fluctuates , in contrast to regular graphs  @xcite where the connectivity is fixed for all vertices .",
    "[ sec : variant ] we can define a variant of this model by introducing a random sign , with a parameter @xmath38 $ ] : for @xmath39 , @xmath40 with probability @xmath41 , @xmath42 with probability @xmath43 and @xmath35 with probability @xmath7 . the even model @xmath44 , which gives @xmath45 , has been studied by some authors  @xcite . if a random graph contains no loops ( i.e. closed circuits ) , the parameter @xmath46 is not relevant because all the negative signs can be changed in positive ones by a simple change of basis .",
    "more generally , it is true if the graph has no `` frustrated '' loops , i.e. no loops with odd number of negative edges .",
    "we will see later that the random spectrum is not sensitive to @xmath46 in the large @xmath0 limit with fixed @xmath10 .",
    "so , without explicit indications , we will speak about the signless model defined previously , which has @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath48 is any random variable on @xmath17 , we use the notation @xmath49 for the expectation value ( or average ) of @xmath48 . in the next sections",
    ", we shall be interested in the asymptotic behavior of the moments of the spectral density @xmath50 when @xmath51 , first with @xmath1 fixed and then with @xmath52 fixed . but first , we recall a few fundamental facts on the topology of random graphs .",
    "the basic reference is @xcite ; for a textbook presentation and more references , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "[ sec : perco ] it is well established that this model has a _ percolation _ transition at @xmath53 . in the regime @xmath54 , with probability 1 in the large @xmath0 limit , all the connected components of the random graph are finite : moreover they are mostly trees , there is only a finite number of one loop components and no other connected components . for a given tree @xmath55 on @xmath56 vertices ,",
    "the average number of connected components isomorphic to @xmath55 is @xmath57 where @xmath58 for a given graph @xmath59 is defined as the order of its automorphism group , [ sec : aut ] formed by the permutations of the vertices that leave its incidence matrix invariant .    in the regime @xmath60 ,",
    "eq  ( [ eq : probtree ] ) remains valid , but one `` giant '' connected component ( equivalent of the percolation cluster for regular lattices ) appears , with a finite fraction of the @xmath0 vertices and many loops .",
    "this fraction is an increasing function of @xmath10 , covering @xmath61 $ ] when @xmath10 runs from 1 to @xmath62 . in the limit @xmath0 large with @xmath1 fixed",
    ", the random graphs is made only with one component .",
    "the percolation transition at @xmath63 is of second order . as usual ,",
    "critical exponents can be defined : by example , the biggest component has a size of order @xmath64",
    ".    moreover this model exhibits  @xcite an anderson _ localization _ transition , also called _ quantum percolation _ transition , at a value @xmath13 . in the phase @xmath65 ,",
    "all eigenvectors of the random incidence matrix are localized .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath66 , the eigenvectors for which the absolute value of the energy is below a threshold @xmath67 becomes extended .    by studying nearest level spacing between eigenvalues",
    ", we expect an exponential distribution of spacing in the localized phase ( because the spatial covering between different eigenvectors vanishes ) , and a goe distribution  @xcite in the delocalized phase . with this kind of criterion , the location transition has been numerically estimated  @xcite at @xmath68 . by considering quantum percolation on a randomly diluted cayley ( or bethe ) tree  @xcite",
    ", it has been conjectured that @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 , ( leading to @xmath71 ) .",
    "we argued  @xcite that this value is exact for random incidence matrices , but that loops have nevertheless some influence on the localization properties .",
    "so the percolation transition has a drastic effect on the topology of the random graph and the localization transition changes the behavior of eigenvectors of its incidence matrix , but as we shall see later , the transitions have no obvious impact on the moments of the spectral distribution of a random matrix .",
    "in fact , the situation may look paradoxical : many relevant quantities for the spectrum of random incidence matrices ( for instance the moments ) can be computed by looking at local structures on the random graph . for fixed @xmath10 and large @xmath0 ,",
    "such structures are trees with probability 1 .",
    "hence loops that appear for @xmath72 seem to play no role .",
    "however , the presence of loops is crucial to ensure that the statistics of finite structures varies smoothly with @xmath10 .",
    "for example , if , instead of random graphs , one considers random forests ( union of trees )  @xcite , one finds that for @xmath73 , the thermodynamical properties are exactly equal to the ones for the random graph model , but the transition at @xmath63 ( when an infinite tree appears ) changes the distribution of local structures , and for instance the moments of the spectral distribution are not analytic at @xmath63 for random forests .",
    "in this section , we derive eq .  ( [ eq : trk = normkplet ] ) , valid for any @xmath0 and edge parameter @xmath1 , which allows , for a given @xmath74 , to compute directly @xmath50 , ( i.e. @xmath0 times the @xmath74th moment of the density of states ) , when @xmath28 is a random incidence matrix in @xmath17 . a sum rule for @xmath75 is given .",
    "then the algorithm is adapted for the variant of the model with random signs .",
    "finally we give a compact formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq : genfuncmom ] ) , for the generating function of moments .      for any random incidence matrix @xmath28 in @xmath17 , @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    ", so we may assume that @xmath78 . by definition , @xmath79 .",
    "because the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath28 vanish , we can restrict the above sum and consider only @xmath74-plet @xmath80 such that @xmath81 .",
    "we call such @xmath74-plets _",
    "so , start with an admissible @xmath74-plet @xmath82 . to compute @xmath83 we argue as follows : the product @xmath84 can take only two values , @xmath4 or @xmath85 .",
    "it has value @xmath85 if and only if each factor has value @xmath85 , that is if and only if @xmath86 are edges of the graph with incidence matrix @xmath28 . from our definition of probabilities on the space of incidence matrices",
    ", this happens with probability @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the number of distinct pairs among @xmath86 . obviously , @xmath88 depends on @xmath89 .",
    "if we could find an efficient way to count the number of admissible @xmath74-plets @xmath89 with given @xmath88 , the problem would be solved .",
    "we have not been able to do so .",
    "however , there is a simple way , which we now expose , to group together families of admissible @xmath74-plets that are guaranteed to have the same @xmath88 .    fix a @xmath74-plet @xmath90 of elements of @xmath91 with the following properties : @xmath92 @xmath93 , and @xmath94 if @xmath95 , there is a @xmath96 such that @xmath97 .",
    "such a @xmath74-plet will be called a _ normalized _",
    "@xmath74-plet in the sequel .",
    "the first condition is almost the definition of an admissible @xmath74-plet , the only difference being that the members are in @xmath91 , not @xmath98 .",
    "the second condition says that the order of appearance of elements of @xmath91 in the sequence @xmath99 is the natural order .",
    "because of these two conditions , @xmath100 and @xmath101 in any normalized @xmath74-plet , but @xmath102 could be 1 or 3 .    by condition @xmath94 ,",
    "the integers appearing in @xmath103 build a set of the form @xmath104 for a certain @xmath105 .",
    "let @xmath106 be the set whose elements are the ( distinct ) pairs among @xmath107 .",
    "now choose an injective map @xmath108 from @xmath109 to @xmath98 .",
    "the number of such maps is @xmath110 .",
    "then the sequence @xmath111 is an admissible @xmath74-plet by the injectivity of @xmath108 and property @xmath92 of the sequence @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , for the same reasons , the number @xmath88 of distinct pairs among the @xmath74 pairs @xmath112 is exactly @xmath113 , the number of elements of @xmath106 .",
    "this number depends on @xmath103 , but not on @xmath108 .",
    "more precisely , there is a one to one correspondence between admissible @xmath74-plets @xmath89 and pairs @xmath114 .",
    "note that the source of @xmath108 depends on @xmath103 .",
    "the bijection involves a simple but useful general algorithm , which we call the `` label and substitute algorithm '' .",
    "we use it several times in the sequel .",
    "if @xmath115 is any finite or infinite list of items ( some items can be repeated ) , one can label the items in order of first appearance .",
    "this means that the first item receives label @xmath85 , then the next item different from the first one receives label @xmath116 and so on .",
    "this gives a one to one map , the `` labeling map '' .",
    "after that , by replacing each item in the list by its label , one obtains a sequence of integers , the `` substitution sequence '' .",
    "it has the property that the first term is @xmath85 and that if integer @xmath117 appears as a term , then integer @xmath33 has appeared before .",
    "note that this new sequence is invariant if we apply the `` label and substitute algorithm '' to it .",
    "note also that the knowledge of the `` labeling map '' and the `` substitution sequence '' allows to reconstruct the original sequence .",
    "let us give an example .",
    "the list ( eat , work , eat , sleep , work , eat , work , sleep ) leads to the `` labeling map''(eat @xmath118,work @xmath119,sleep @xmath120 ) , and to the `` substitution sequence '' @xmath121 .",
    "if @xmath122 is an admissible @xmath74-plet , we apply the `` label and substitute algorithm '' .",
    "then @xmath108 is the inverse of the `` labeling map '' of @xmath89 and @xmath103 is the `` substitution sequence '' of @xmath89 .",
    "the properties of @xmath89 making it an admissible @xmath74-plet and the definition of the `` label and substitute algorithm '' ensure that @xmath103 is a normalized @xmath74-plet .    written symbolically , this means that @xmath123 where the sum over @xmath89 is over admissible @xmath74-plets , the sum over @xmath103 is over normalized @xmath74-plets , and the sum over @xmath108 is over injective maps as described above . inserting @xmath124 on both sides of this identity , we obtain our first important formula : @xmath125 where @xmath109 and @xmath106 are functions of @xmath103 as defined above . in this formula ,",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1-dependence are completely explicit . for finite @xmath74 and large @xmath0",
    "this is clearly useful because the @xmath103 s are defined independently of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is not difficult in principle to enumerate normalized @xmath74-plets in standard lexicographic order , hence in particular in order of increasing @xmath126 , and then compute for each normalized @xmath74-plet the value of @xmath113 .",

    "the results are available upon request to the authors .",
    "we have checked our enumeration against a simple sum rule .",
    "we put @xmath75 and sum over @xmath113 . in this case , with probability @xmath85 , the random graph becomes complete and the matrix @xmath28 is equal to @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the @xmath18 identity matrix and @xmath151 is the @xmath18 matrix with all entries equal to @xmath85 . but @xmath149 has only two eigenvalues , @xmath152 with multiplicity @xmath85 and @xmath153 with multiplicity @xmath152 .",

    "equivalently the edges of the random graph are dressed with a random sign @xmath187 .",
    "for an admissible @xmath74-plet @xmath82 , we find @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the sign asymmetry , @xmath190 is the number of distinct pairs among @xmath86 and @xmath191 ( resp .",

    "@xmath103 can be interpreted as a closed walk on the graph visiting all edges ( this implies in particular that the graph is connected ) , the order of first visit to a vertex respecting the natural order : @xmath103 starts at vertex @xmath85 , and its first visit to vertex @xmath116 occurs before its first visit to vertex @xmath199 and so on .",

    "a day of symbolic computation with this formula gives the @xmath376 as integers up to @xmath161 . with 12 digits precision",
    ", a fortran program goes to @xmath390 in about the same time .",
    "the results are available upon request to the authors .       by summing on @xmath377",
    ", we retrieve the coefficients @xmath391 .",
    "the first of these are given in table  [ tab : lkl ] .",
    "as the average @xmath392 is not zero , we compute the _ centered _ moments @xmath393 , which are still polynomial in @xmath10 of degree the integer part of @xmath394 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath395 are given in table  [ tab : lklc ] .",
    "the shape of the distribution evolves with @xmath10 : in particular , it becomes non symmetric as the odd centered moments do not vanish .",
    "again , we observe that the results for large @xmath0 with fixed @xmath1 are found by keeping the last diagonal of table  [ tab : lkl ] and table  [ tab : lklc ] , corresponding to the large @xmath10 limit ."
