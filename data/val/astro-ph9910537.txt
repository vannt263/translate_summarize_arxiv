    "deep multicolor surveys from hst and ground based telescopes coupled with deep spectroscopy on ten meter class telescopes ( keck , vlt ) are leading to a remarkable progress in our understanding of the galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "in particular , there has been great improvement in the knowledge of the epoch of star formation .",
    "the first determinations of the global star formation history suggested a peak at @xmath6 with a further decline from @xmath7 to @xmath8 ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ; connolly et al .",
    "1997 ) . in this scenario , more than 80% of the stars would have been formed recently at @xmath9",
    ".    such a picture would be in rough agreement with the cold dark matter ( cdm ) models of galaxy formation , which predict the star formation to be a gradual process governed by gas cooling and supernovae feedback .",
    "the timescale of the process is strongly related to the rate at which the mass is hierarchically assembled to form larger galaxies from smaller structures ( white & frenk 1991 ; cole et al .",
    "1994 ; kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; baugh et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "however , the above scenario is presently challenged by recent indications that the observed decline at @xmath10 is affected by incompleteness in the color selection and by dust extinction .",
    "in fact , more recent observational evidence limited to the optically selected galaxies , points towards a flat sfr for @xmath10 ( giallongo et al .",
    "1998 , pascarelle et al .",
    "1998 , steidel et al . 1999 ) .",
    "a more precise test of the galaxy formation scenarios involves the study of the size and morphological distribution of galaxies with cosmic time , since this is related to the main feature of the hierarchical models , namely , the growth of mass and sizes of typical condensations . indeed ,",
    "although the global star formation history is a crucial issue in galaxy formation , it is an integrated quantity ; even a flat sfr could be consistent with the cdm picture by tuning the parameters describing the gas cooling and the supernovae feedback in galaxies .",
    "the first observational investigations of the differential evolution of the galaxy population over the redshift range @xmath11 were carried out by lilly et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , cowie et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and ellis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) by means of spectroscopic redshift surveys .",
    "the observed decrease with the cosmic time of the blue star - forming galaxy population showing strong emission lines has been further investigated using the hubble space telescope .",
    "the decline is a mixture of stellar evolution in normal spirals and strong evolution in low luminosity irregulars ( schade et al .",
    "1995 , brinchmann et al .",
    "1998 , lilly et al . 1998 ) whose local counterparts now comprise the faint end of the local luminosity function ( zucca et al .",
    "1997 ) .    subsequently , the study of the hubble deep field ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) has resulted in a strong improvement in the knowledge of the galaxy morphology at high redshift ( abraham et al .",
    "1996 , odewahn et al .",
    "1996 , driver et al .",
    "1998 ) showing a high fraction of faint irregular galaxies .",
    "most of these galaxies have small sizes resulting in a physical extent of the order of @xmath12 kpc at @xmath13 ( glazebrook et al .",
    "1998 ) . such small sizes ,",
    "if compared with the present day galaxy morphology included in the hubble sequence , could imply physical growth and merging occurring with increasing cosmic time ( bouwens , broadhurst and silk 1997 ) , in qualitative agreement with the hierarchical clustering picture . on the other hand , the indications for a slow evolution of the spiral population constituted by the presence of large , relatively bright spirals at @xmath14 ( schade et al .",
    "1995 ) are difficult to fit in the picture of the cdm - like models .",
    "indeed , the dissipative formation of galactic disks in cdm halos predicted by the hierarchical clustering scenario produces spirals whose size strongly decreases as the formation redshift increases . for this reason ,",
    "gas cooling in the cdm halos has to be delayed to low redshifts ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the comparison becomes more stringent for the lower luminosity spirals where the predicted sizes are very small at high redshifts .    a wide field survey of faint galaxies observed with the hubble space telescope would be the ideal sample to clarify the issue and to provide a differential and quantitative test to cdm galaxy formation theories",
    ". however deep photometry from hst can only be obtained on small areas .",
    "on the contrary , wide field surveys of faint galaxies can be obtained using ground - based instrumentation but at lower resolution ( fwhm@xmath16 arcsec ) .    in this paper",
    "we have exploited the deep photometric information of the ntt deep field ( arnouts et al .",
    "1999 ) obtained under condition of subarcsec seeing at the eso ntt telescope to derive morphological information after appropriate seeing deconvolution ( sect .",
    "the reliability of the deconvolution technique has been tested by means of numerical simulations and particularly by checking on somewhat shallower hst images of the same galaxy field retrived from the hst archive .",
    "the results show that it is possible to derive the radial intensity profiles of galaxies with @xmath0 from ground - based imaging with fwhm@xmath17 arcsec ( sect .",
    "the derived intrinsic angular sizes are then converted into physical sizes adopting reliable photometric redshifts estimated from the ubvrijk multicolor distribution of each galaxy in the catalog . the galaxy morphological distribution in redshift and luminosity is shown in sect .  4 and",
    "is compared with that predicted by hierachical clustering models for the disk formation in sect .",
    "the conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "the galaxy catalog has been obtained from the ntt deep field ( ndf ) ( arnouts et al .",
    "the optical observations were obtained in the johnson bv , and gunn r , i broadband filters with the @xmath18 susi camera on the eso new technology telescope .",
    "the resulting field of view is @xmath19 arcmin@xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath21 magnitude limits are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , the average seeing was @xmath26 arcsec ( see arnouts et al .",
    "1999 for further details ) .",
    "deep ultraviolet images have been added with the susi-2 camera at the ntt reaching a 3@xmath27 upper limit of @xmath28 . also deep near infrared observations",
    "have been added with the sofi instrument at the ntt reaching 3@xmath27 magnitude limits of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the galaxy catalog has been extracted from the sum of the bvri weighted frames to detect objects at very faint level in the four bands ( arnouts et al .",
    "the object detection and photometry have been performed with the sextractor image analysis package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "total magnitudes in the ubvrijk bands were computed from isophotal magnitudes for galaxies brighter than i=23.25 and from aperture magnitudes in 2.2 arcsec corrected to 5 arcsec for fainter objects .",
    "colors are computed in a 2 arcsec diameter aperture in the same sky area in all the bands after correction for the different seeing conditions .",
    "details on the data reduction and photometry are fully discussed in fontana et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    to each galaxy in the ubvrijk catalog ,",
    "a photometric redshift estimate has been assigned with the same best fitting procedure applied in the contiguous br1202 - 0725 field ( giallongo et al .",
    "this has been obtained through a comparison of the observed colors with those predicted by spectral synthesis ( gissel ) models ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) including uv absorption by the intergalactic medium and dust reddening .",
    "the catalog of the photometric redshifts is presented in fontana et al .",
    "the resulting typical redshift accuracy is @xmath31 up to @xmath32 and @xmath33 at larger redshifts .    the redshift distribution in the ntt deep field is shown in fig .  1 for galaxies with @xmath0 .",
    "as derived in other fields of similar depth , the bulk of the galaxies present are at intermediate redshifts @xmath34 with a tail in the distribution up to @xmath35 .",
    "the shape of the optical counts in this field suggests negligible correction for incompleteness at @xmath36 ( arnouts et al .",
    "1999 ) thus the morphological study described in the next sections should be considered complete to this magnitude limit .",
    "the estimate of the intrinsic radial intensity profiles derived from deep ground based images of faint galaxies is a complex task .",
    "indeed , hst images of galaxies with @xmath37 have shown that most of them have typical sizes corresponding to half light radii @xmath38 arcsec which are smaller than the typical hwhm@xmath39 arcsec present in ground based deep images .",
    "accurate and reliable deconvolution techniques must be applied to obtain any statistical information about the intrinsic half light radii of faint galaxies observed from the ground .",
    "any deconvolution technique depends of course on the accurate knowledge of the instrumental profile ( psf ) and on the intrinsic shape assumed for the galaxies .",
    "an accurate reconstruction of the instrumental profile is generally done through an average of the stellar profiles with high s / n ratio in images with good oversampling .",
    "concerning the intrinsic shape of the galaxies , instead of assuming a specified profile , we adopted the multigaussian deconvolution analysis studied in detail by bendinelli ( 1991 ) and also recently applied to faint elliptical galaxies in the hdf by fasano et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    for each object detected in the sum of the bvri weighted frames ,",
    "a radial intensity profile was obtained , sampling the light into elliptical annuli with axes proportional to the object intensity - weighted second order moments .",
    "following fasano et al .",
    "( 1998 ) we chose to carry out the analysis on a circularly symmetrized profile , where the radial distance along the semi - major axis @xmath40 is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the sextractor elongation parameter .",
    "a multi gaussian expansion of these symmetrized profiles has been developed as described below .",
    "if @xmath43 is the true , deconvolved profile of the object , it is possible to obtain a simple but effective approximation of it : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total luminosity of the source , @xmath46 and @xmath47 the spread parameter and the weight of each gaussian , respectively .",
    "we adopt @xmath48 as a compromise between the need of sampling the profile with the maximum allowed number of gaussians and the need of performing a well - posed fit .",
    "weighting parameters are obviously not independent : their sum must be equal to one .    in an analogous way an expansion of the normalized point spread function in the frame was carried out , so that it was possible to have an analytical solution of the convolution integral :    @xmath49 } \\label{eq : mge}\\ ] ]    where the terms with index `` i '' refer to the multi gaussian expansion of the psf .",
    "once the psf expansion is known , it is possible to fit eq .",
    "[ eq : mge ] to the observed points , obtaining the spread and weighting parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 of the deconvolved profile .    in order to verify the reliability of the deconvolution technique in our particular case , we have performed two checks .",
    "first of all we have produced a set of simulations specifically designed to reproduce typical conditions in our sample .",
    "second , we have compared , for a bright galaxy subsample , intrinsic half light radii derived from the i band galaxy profiles taken at the ntt with that derived from a relatively deep image in the i band taken at the wfpc2 on hst .    in the first check ,",
    "intensity profiles have been reproduced as in the observed ntt deep field assuming the same pixel sampling and the same average seeing ( fwhm@xmath26 arcsec ) .",
    "assuming an intrinsic exponential profile , a series of synthetic images were constructed using different half light radii ranging from @xmath52  to @xmath53  with a step of 0.1  .",
    "an average of 25 random objects were computed for each radius , assuming a total magnitude of @xmath54 and of @xmath55 which are typical values for a bright and a faint object in our sample . in this way",
    "the s / n ratio is constant in the simulations . in order to reproduce the average seeing conditions in the ndf ,",
    "the background subtracted image of a bright star was selected in the field .",
    "its normalized profile was then convolved with the synthetic images of the disk galaxies .",
    "the convolved two dimensional profiles were randomly inserted in regions of the ntt deep field far from very bright objects to reproduce with the appropriate pixel size and noise levels the observed ntt galaxies . finally , the multigaussian deconvolution technique was applied to the synthetic data .",
    "we first notice that we have no selection bias against galaxies with large size ( @xmath56 arcsec ) and low surface brightness down to @xmath57 since all the synthetic objects were detected .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  2 ,",
    "where the error bars represent the dispersion around the mean due to noise in the background subtraction . a good match between the intrinsic and measured half light radii",
    "has been obtained up to @xmath58 arcsec . for larger values ,",
    "a slight underestimate in the measured values appears particularly for the faint subsample . in any case",
    "it can be seen that , even for the faint galaxies with @xmath37 , the overall correlation between intrinsic and measured half - light radii is preserved in such a way that an intrinsically large , faint object , e.g. with @xmath59 , can not be detected as a small sized one , e.g. with @xmath60 .",
    "the simulation shows that the fraction of small size galaxies observed in the ndf is real and is not due to intrinsically larger objects which have been shrunk by noise effects .    for the brighter galaxies we had the opportunity to check directly the reliability of our deconvolution technique comparing our i band image photometry of the ntt deep field with the i band wfpc2 image photometry taken from the hst archive .",
    "we have applied to the wfpc2 galaxies the same deconvolution technique using an average psf derived from the available stellar profiles in the field . since the wfpc2 image is not as deep as the ntt i band image and the overlap between the two images is limited to less than half of the field , the comparison was limited to a few relatively bright objects with @xmath61 . in fig .",
    "3 the deconvolved half light radii derived from ground based and hst i band images are compared .",
    "the agreement is very good with a rms difference of 0.05 .",
    "a similar agreement for the galaxy scale lengths has been found by schade et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for a sample of cfrs galaxies two mag brighter , @xmath62 .",
    "thus , although hst images allow more detailed morphological studies with a decomposition of the intensity profiles into more components ( e.g. bulge plus disk decomposition ) , the statistical information is limited by the small field of view .",
    "large statistical information on the galaxy @xmath63 from wide field ground based images can be used to constrain the models of galaxy formation . as a first step",
    ", we have applied this technique to the multicolor ntt deep field .",
    "the results are discussed in the next section .",
    "the distribution of the half light radii @xmath63 for all the galaxies in the multicolor catalog with @xmath64 is shown in fig .  4 .",
    "the median value of the distribution is @xmath1  , which confirms previous findings from the hst medium deep survey ( mds ) .",
    "in fact , the derived distribution is very similar to that of the mds ( roche et al .",
    "this is an important result since it has been obtained by means of ground based observations .",
    "assuming that all the galaxies are characterized by a disk with a given scale length @xmath65 , we have computed the linear size for each galaxy as a function of redshift using the color estimated redshifts as discussed in section 2 .",
    "the resulting luminosity - size relation is shown in fig .",
    "5 in two redshift intervals .",
    "uncertainties in the redshift estimates @xmath31 produce uncertainties in the sizes and luminosities @xmath19% and @xmath66% , respectively .",
    "5 shows a concentration of faint galaxies with @xmath67 kpc that is present at @xmath68 .",
    "this is more evident in the @xmath3 interval where the galaxy distribution extends down to @xmath69 .",
    "the histogram of the size distribution is shown in fig .  6 in the same redshift intervals where a peak of low - luminosity dwarf galaxies appears for @xmath70 kpc .",
    "however the assumption of a disk - like structure for the majority of the faint galaxies can no longer be valid because of the presence of a noticeable fraction of dwarf galaxies with irregular morphology .",
    "although it is not clear if the images of the high @xmath71 galaxies seen at progressively shorter wavelengths can produce a spuriously increasing number of irregular galaxies , we have attemped to exclude galaxies with irregular morphology following the method described in abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . with this method",
    ", galaxies are separated into three classes ( irregulars , spirals , s0-ellipticals ) according to the values of their asymmetry and concentration parameters .",
    "the asymmetry parameter is defined as : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the background - subtracted intensity of the original image and the same after 180-degree rotation around the baricenter , respectively . here",
    "the sum is extended to the isophotal detection area of every source , and @xmath75 takes account of the bias introduced in a by the underlying portion of the sky with the same area and shape as the object . for the concentration parameter",
    "we have : @xmath76 where @xmath77 refers to a circular aperture with a radius @xmath78 so that it has the same number of pixels as the isophotal detection area of the object . in an analogous way @xmath79",
    "is an inner circular area with radius @xmath80 .",
    "we chose to adopt @xmath81 instead of @xmath82 because we found that this larger value takes account of the seeing blurring of the sources in the ndf compared to the hst high resolution images .",
    "the distribution in the asymmetry - concentration plane shown in fig .",
    "7 is in good agreement with the abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) distribution derived from the hubble deep field galaxies of comparable magnitude .    in fig",
    ".  7 regular spiral galaxies are distributed in the central region delimited by the two straight lines defined in abraham et al .",
    "their distribution in the luminosity - size plane is also shown by filled symbols in fig .",
    "we have reproduced in fig .",
    "8 the size distribution of the normal spirals in the same redshift interval as in fig",
    "it can be seen that even reducing the sample to the more regular spirals , the size distribution in fig .",
    "8 is very similar in shape to that of the whole sample shown in fig .  6 with a peak at very small sizes @xmath83 kpc .",
    "this is expected since the distribution of disk - dominated systems in the luminosity - size plane ( filled circles in fig .",
    "5 ) follows the distribution of the whole sample .",
    "this behaviour has interesting consequences for cosmological scenarios of galaxies formation .",
    "the size distribution of different spectral types as a function of redshift is in principle a powerful tool to constrain models of galaxy formation in hierarchical cdm cosmogonies .",
    "indeed , in these models the galaxy formation proceeds through subsequent merging of small units into larger ones , corresponding to a hierarchical growth of the typical mass of virialized condensations .",
    "since these models predict galaxies in the range @xmath84 to be still assembling , the corresponding size growth should be detectable by present - day surveys .",
    "quantitatively , to compare the predictions of the cdm models with deep imaging observations , one needs to express the outcomes of the hierarchical clustering picture in terms of observable properties , i.e. , luminosities and sizes . the first goal is usually pursued through the use of semi - analytical models ( white & frenk 1991 ; cole et al . 1994 ; kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; baugh et al .",
    "1998 ) , which are able to predict luminosity functions and tully - fisher relations in reasonable agreement with existing observations . as for the galaxy sizes , quantitative attempts to relate them to the mass growth of cosmic structures have been done only for the regular spiral population ( mo , mao & white 1998 ) .    to compare with observations we have to connect the galaxy sizes with their luminous properties . to this aim",
    ", we first used the mo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) model to connect the scale length of any exponential disk @xmath85 to the dark matter ( dm hereafter ) circular velocity @xmath86 ; then we used the approach of semi - analytical models to connect @xmath86 to the luminous properties of galaxies .",
    "the predicted relations among luminosity , size and redshift of the field spirals have then been used to derive statistical distributions which have been compared with the observed ones .      in the framework of present theories of galaxy formation the size of the disk @xmath85",
    "can be related to the circular velocity of the disk ( @xmath87 ) and of the dm ( @xmath88 ) halo , assuming that the mass and angular momentum of the baryonic material which settles into the disk are fixed fractions ",
    "@xmath89 and @xmath90  of the dm mass @xmath91 and angular momentum @xmath92 ( see mo , mao & white 1998 ) .",
    "the latter can be expressed in dimensionless units @xmath93 , whose distribution @xmath94 is known from several n - body experiments ( see warren et al . 1992 ; cole & lacey 1996 ; steinmetz & bartelmann 1995 ) .    for a galaxy",

    "the function @xmath100 is related to the total energy of the nfw profile while @xmath101 includes also the gravitational effect of the disk in the density distribution .",
    "fitting formulas for the last two functions are provided by mo et al .",
    ".    note that in the above model the disk contributes to the rotation velocity , increasing by more than 20 % the value of @xmath86 given by the dm halo .",
    "we have taken this effect into account in our computations .",
    "the power spectrum of the initial dm density perturbation ( from which the dm halos are thought to be formed via gravitational instability ) enters the computation through the concentration factor @xmath102 .",
    "according to the above discussion , and following the lines in mo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we have computed the @xmath103 and the @xmath104 relations for different cdm perturbation spectra . in order to compare the results with the outcome of the data analysis we have converted the @xmath103 ( or @xmath104 ) relationships into @xmath105 as described in the next section .      to implement the present understanding of the process of galaxy formation and evolution  and",
    "thus to associate magnitutes to the dm galaxy masses  we propose an analytical rendition of the semi - analytical approaches introduced by kauffman , white & guiderdoni ( 1993 ) and by cole et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and subsequently developed by several authors ( see somerville & primack 1998 ) . in these models",
    "the dm halos form through the gravitational instability of initial random density fluctuations whose power spectrum depends on the nature of the dm .",
    "the baryons within the dm halo , heated to the virial temperature of the halo , are assumed to be distributed in three phases : a cold phase where the gas is radiatively cooled and star formation may occur , a condensed phase ( stars ) and a hot phase ( gas re - heated by supernovae explosions ) .",
    "the hierarchical merging of the halos ( followed by the possible merging of the galaxies contained in the halos ) and the luminosity evolution due to the evolution of the stellar population are also included in the model .",
    "the interplay among these phases and the details of our implementation of the hierarchical models of galaxy formations are given in appendix a. following the lines in the literature , the parameters regulating the star formation have been chosen so as to match the local observed properties of the galaxies , i.e. , the i - band tully - fisher relation and the b - band luminosity function . however , since the disk velocity @xmath87 is @xmath106 higher than that of the dm , matching the predictions of the model with both the above observables is critical . e.g. , setting the star formation parameters to maximize the match to the observed tully - fisher relation for a `` milky way '' galaxy with @xmath86=220 km / s , yields an excess of bright galaxies in the local luminosity function ( as noted by somerville & primack 1998 ) . a further and complementary constraint",
    "is provided by the faint end of the luminosity function ; minimizing the mismatch between the observed and predicted tully - fisher relation at faint magnitudes leads to a luminosity function too steep at the faint end .",
    "for these reasons , we have selected the set of free parameters that minimizes the discrepancy of the model results with respect to both the local tully - fisher relation and the local b - band luminosity function .",
    "for the angular momentum parameters ( determining the @xmath107 ratio and thus affecting the predicted tully - fisher relation ) we have obtained @xmath108 . for the star formation parameters we have obtained the set reported in appendix a. for the cosmology we have adopted a tilted cdm cosmogony",
    "( normalized to cobe with @xmath109 and @xmath110 km s@xmath111 mpc@xmath111 ) ; the predictions of semi - analytical models with such a power spectrum are very close to the mixed ( hot+cold ) dm models , which are in fair agreement with the data for a wide set of observations ( see primack et al .",
    "1995 ) . with this recipe",
    "we have obtained a reasonable agreement of the model prediction with the local luminosity function and tully - fisher relation ( fig .",

    "( 1998 ) .      in fig .",
    "11 we show how the galaxy sizes are distributed in absolute magnitude in four redshift intervals .",
    "the dots are the observed data while the shaded regions correspond to the cdm predictions .",
    "the latter depend on the value of the dimensionless angular momentum @xmath112 which is distributed according to the function @xmath94 in the interval @xmath113 , the extreme values being the 10% and 90% points of @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "the solid line corresponds to @xmath114 , i.e. , to the 50% point of the distribution @xmath94 .",
    "note that at bright ( @xmath115 ) magnitudes the observed points are approximately equally distributed above and below the solid line , and fall in the region allowed by the cdm model . in fact , for the bright galaxies ( where a measurement of the disk rotation velocity has been possible ) the model by mo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , relating size and circular velocity , is in agreement with the observations ; since our model tully - fisher relation relating @xmath87 to @xmath116 is also in agreement with observations ( see fig .",
    "9 ) , the matching between our predicted and observed distributions provides a consistency check of the theoretical approach used to derive the galaxy properties in cdm models .",
    "however , at fainter magnitudes ( @xmath68 ) , the observed sizes tend to occupy systematically the small size region below the 50% locus of the angular momentum distribution .    to investigate more quantitatively this point , the differential size distribution of galaxies with @xmath64 is shown in fig .  8 , for different redshift bins",
    "the model results include the full @xmath94 distribution to take account of all the values of angular momentum that a galaxy with given @xmath85 and @xmath87 can have at a given @xmath71 .",
    "to compare the model with the observed data in our sample , we have also introduced a magnitude limit at @xmath64 .",
    "this limit has the effect of selecting brighter ( and hence larger ) objects at higher @xmath71 .",
    "this effect tends to balance the decrease with @xmath71 of the disk size predicted by cdm models ( as shown in fig .",
    "10 at given absolute magnitude ) , resulting in an apparent lack of evolution with @xmath71 of the distributions predicted by the cdm model ( see fig .",
    "the comparison with the data shows a general agreement , although an excess of small - size objects is evident with respect to the cdm predictions .",
    "this points towards a galaxy size evolution from high to low @xmath71 slower than predicted by cdm models , with the persistence of small size objects dominating in number at faint magnitudes and at intermediate to low redshifts .",
    "the differential distributions in fig .",
    "8 are plotted in terms of absolute numbers in our 5 arcmin@xmath20 field , so that the excess at small sizes over the cdm predictions is not affected by any possible incompleteness at the large / bright end of the distribution , which could be present at lower @xmath71 in our limited sized field .",
    "we also note that the excess is robust with respect to any possible systematic errors in the selection of disk galaxies using the concentration - asymmetry plane shown in fig .",
    "7 . indeed , when the whole sample is considered ( including also bulge and irregular systems ) the resulting distributions shown in fig .",
    "6 are very similar to the distributions of the `` spiral '' sample shown in fig .",
    "in particular , the excess with respect to the cdm predictions at small sizes is still present .",
    "the size distribution in a ground based sample of faint galaxies to @xmath36 is peaked at @xmath1 arcsec , in good agreement with that found at similar magnitudes in the hst medium deep survey .",
    "a morphological selection based on the asymmetry and concentration parameters gives a distribution similar to the one found by abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) from hst data . from this distribution a sample of normal spirals has been selected .",
    "photometric redshifts have been obtained for this sample using the available multicolor catalog .",
    "a clear distinction in the morphological properties of galaxies fainter or bighter than @xmath117 has been found , especially in the @xmath3 redshift interval .",
    "in particular the fainter galaxies show a marked concentration toward small ( @xmath118 kpc ) sizes ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "the comparison of the observed galaxy sizes with those predicted by hierarchical clustering cdm models at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath119 ) indicates an excess of faint , small - size galaxies with respect to the model predictions ( see figs .  6 , 8 , 11 ) .",
    "a better agreement is found at brighter ( @xmath115 ) magnitudes .",
    "different reasons could be responsible for this excess :    \\a ) the _ ad hoc _ assumption that all the disks have masses and angular momenta that are a fixed fraction of those of their dm counterparts ( @xmath120 const . ) is incorrect for small galaxies . in fact , numerical n - body simulations indicate that the gas loses most of its angular momentum to the dm during galaxy assembly ( navarro & benz 1991 ; navarro & white 1994 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) , although the effect of supernovae feedback ( not included in the simulation ) is still unclear . in this case , however , the problem of explaining why the assumption @xmath121 works for more massive galaxies should be solved .",
    "\\b ) the faint - end of the galaxy luminosity distribution evolves slower than predicted by hierarchical models .",
    "the observed population of small galaxies corresponds to the turn - off in the galaxy luminosity function at the faint end , and those galaxies constitute a population evolving in a physically different way from the body of the distribution due , for example , to the lack of aggregation of objects of small circular velocity .",
    "this would break the self - similarity of the hierarchical clustering evolution at small galactic scales .",
    "\\c ) the luminosity of the satellite small galaxies within a given dm halo does not take into account star bursting phenomena due to merging interactions within the halo . for a fixed galaxy luminosity",
    "this implies an excess of small size objects .",
    "\\d ) the evolution of the number of galaxies within a halo is poorly described by semianalytical models .",
    "the two body aggregation processes in fact could produce a strong number evolution resulting in an excess of small objects as the redshift increases .",
    "these results have to be checked on a larger sample where the morphological parameters are measured on high resolution images .",
    "the vlt telescopes could be ideal in this respect in terms of field of view , photometric depth and optical quality .",
    "moreover , a caution should be emphasized when we associate the galaxy morphological properties derived from the observations to the unknown dynamical properties of the faint galaxies .",
    "all the previous arguments apply only if these faint objects are sustained by rotation .",
    "rotational curves of galaxies with @xmath37 can not be measured with the current technology on 8 m class telescopes .",

    "the number density @xmath126 of dark matter ( dm ) halos with circular velocity @xmath124 present at the initial redshift @xmath127 is taken from the press & schechter expression .",

    "a halo mass @xmath128 $ ] and a virial temperature @xmath129 are associated .",
    "the initial gas content associated to all the halos corresponds to the universal baryonic density @xmath130 .",
    "the initial stellar content is taken to be 0 . for each circular velocity , the baryonic content is divided into a cold gas phase ( the one able to cool within the halo survival time @xmath131 ) , with mass @xmath132 , into a star phase , with mass @xmath133 , and the complementary hot phase , with mass @xmath134 .    * b ) * for each galaxy circular velocity @xmath86 , we compute the variations of the mass of the gas components and of the stellar content due to merging of dm halos , possibly followed by galaxy merging . at each time step , we first compute i ) the probability @xmath135 that a halo at time @xmath136 with velocity @xmath137 is included in a halo with velocity @xmath124 at time @xmath138 , and ii ) the associated halo merging rate @xmath139 : these are computed in the framework of the so - called extended press & schechter theory ( epst , see bond et al .",
