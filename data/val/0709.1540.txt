    "this can be understood in terms of the reduction of the bow wave effect in the density profile around the particle by the stokes flow in the solvent which advects the polymers .",
    "the forces in the bd simulations are of the same order of magnitude as in the ideal case , but in the case of the stokes flow they have a weaker dependence on @xmath113 . because the sizes involved are of the order of the microscopic length @xmath10 , the variance of the force measured in the brownian dynamics is relatively large .",
    "however , we find that it is not affected by the flow type and velocity and it coincides with the variance of @xmath178 we have measured in the equilibrium state ( @xmath157 ) . for comparison , tab .",
    "[ tab : finite ] collects the force measured in the bd simulation in the smaller box . the increased force is consistent with the density enhancement near the particle caused by the finite  size effects .",

    "mean force exerted by the polymers measured in the bd simulations for different types of flow ( @xmath104 for the uniform flow , and @xmath155 for the stokes flow ) , compared to the force exerted by ideal polymers and to the stokes friction of the colloid .",

    "we have proposed a dynamic density functional theory ( ddft ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddft ] ) , for interacting brownian particles in a flowing solvent under the assumption that detailed balance holds ( which requires , in particular , a curl - free flow ) . we get the same equation as already derived in @xcite but with the partial time derivative replaced by the total ( material ) time derivative .",
    "the whole effect of the flow field can be summarized into a modified external potential , allowing application of the whole machinery of equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "thus , we are able to find an h - theorem for a modified free energy .    in this paper",
    "we include the displacement of the solvent by the colloid , but the hydrodynamic interactions between the colloid and the solute particles as well as the hydrodynamic interactions among the solute particles were not taken into account .",
    "while the latter is a highly non - trivial and still open problem , the first can be included in a straightforward manner by replacing the mobility @xmath174 by a space dependent and symmetric mobility tensor @xmath180 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : brownian ] ) and ( [ eq : noisecorrelator ] ) .",
    "thereby the noise becomes multiplicative and the appropriate calculus has to be considered such that it leads to the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq : fokkerplanck ] ) with @xmath174 replaced by @xmath180 .",
    "then the equilibrium distribution is not changed . for spherical particles in the vicinity of planar walls",
    "the mobility tensor can be calculated in the limit of large distances @xcite .",
    "this result has been extended to surfaces with a partial slip boundary condition in @xcite . due to the translational symmetry of the system",

    "while the mobility perpendicular to the wall increases with distance , the distance dependence of the mobility parallel to the wall depends on the slip condition . for",
    "no - slip it increases while for total slip it decreases with the distance to the wall .",
    "the hydrodynamic interaction between two spheres has been calculated , e.g. , in the rotne - prager approximation @xcite .",
    "the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddft ] ) essentially carries through with the only exception that the quotient @xmath182 in eq .",

    "@xcite , the polymer distribution was studied in a polymer solution flowing uniformly through a spherical particle which is hard only for the polymers . in spite of the violation of detailed balance by the boundary conditions ,",
    "the comparison between simulations and the numerical solution of the proposed ddft was good . in this paper",
    "we have considered the more realistic case of a stokes flow  ( [ eq : sphereflow ] ) around the particle .",
    "the exact solution of the ideal case ( no polymer  polymer interaction ) , the numerical solution of the interacting case as well as the corresponding brownian dynamics simulations evidence all the dramatic effect by advection on the properties of the stationary solution .",
    "we conclude that the approximation of uniform flow , as employed in refs .",
    "@xcite , is quantitatively bad .",
    "we have found discrepancies in the density distribution of polymers as measured in the simulations and as computed numerically in the framework of the ddft .",
    "however , the discrepancies could be rationalized in terms of finite  size effects in the simulations due to the slow decay of the stokes flow far from the obstacle .",
