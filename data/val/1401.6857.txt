    "many - body quantum physics in one dimension @xcite is a well - known theater in which strong correlation effects systematically take the leading role . besides providing many examples of quantum critical ground states , one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems",
    "also interestingly suffer from the breakdown of single - particle pictures , making calculations difficult but providing interesting physics through the appearance of new forms of quasiparticles with unconventional ( fractionalized ) statistics , dispersions and correlations .",
    "much of our understanding of 1d systems stems from the existence of robust nonperturbative methods developed over the last decades .",
    "first and foremost , the concept of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid @xcite and the technique of bosonization @xcite have provided the consistent framework for describing the universal low - energy physics of these systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of isolated examples of exactly - solvable 1d models @xcite whose wavefunctions can be obtained from bethe ansatz @xcite has opened up the door to many nonperturbative computations of physical properties of representative systems .",
    "one seldom - exploited characteristic of the bethe ansatz is that , in marked contrast to bosonization , it provides exact wavefunctions for _ any _ state in the hilbert space , irrespective of its energy . besides allowing to consider _",
    "e.g. _ finite - temperature thermodynamics of exactly - solvable models , this fact also opens the door to the investigation of many more general issues going beyond conventional equilibrium physics .",
    "our aim here is to consider a relatively simple class of states of 1d repulsive bosons which display a number of interesting properties .",
    "these states , which can be intuitively pictured as eigenstates in which the fluid contains a number of ` pockets ' of atoms moving at distinct momenta , share many features with the ground state , including signs of quantum criticality .",
    "since they are extremely highly excited states , they would ultimately be unstable to external perturbations ; on the other hand , being eigenstates of a physically meaningful hamiltonian , their lifetimes can in principle be extremely large if perturbations are weak .",
    "they therefore realize another instance of ` metastable criticality ' @xcite in interacting gases .    on the experimental side ,",
    "there has been remarkable progress in the realization and investigation of isolated quantum systems @xcite , in particular bosonic systems in 1d , these providing rich and interesting physics @xcite .",
    "part of our motivation thus also came from the famous quantum newton s cradle experiment @xcite in which a bragg pulse is used to produce an initial state with a doubly - peaked momentum distribution . in attempts to understand this experiment , proximity to integrability",
    "is often invoked as the physical reason for the absence of relaxation .",
    "although not meant to model this initial state accurately , the states we consider do contain similar features in their momentum distribution function , and might form a useful starting point for a more refined attempt at phenomenology .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after introducing the lieb - liniger model",
    ", we precisely define the type of states that we will study . a detailed discussion of the excitations that govern the correlations in the system is followed by results for dynamical correlations obtained numerically from an integrability - based method .",
    "we provide results for the most easily measured observables , namely the density correlations ( the dynamical structure factor ) and the momentum distribution function .",
    "we then discuss how the system can be understood in terms of a multicomponent luttinger liquid , for which all effective parameters are related to data computable from integrability .",
    "finally , we compare the computed correlations with the asymptotic luttinger liquid , parameter - free predictions , and end with conclusions and perspectives .",
    "the lieb - liniger model @xcite is a model for one - dimensional bosons with a @xmath0-function interaction .",
    "setting @xmath1 the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath2 \\label{eq : lieblinigerh}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 are boson annihilation / creation operators obeying canonical equal - time commutation relations @xmath4 = \\delta(x - x')$ ] .",
    "the interaction strength is parametrized by a single dimensionless parameter , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the average density .",
    "we will only consider repulsive interactions @xmath7 , and will for definiteness impose periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the @xmath8-particle wave functions are given by the bethe ansatz as a linear combination of plane waves @xmath9 where @xmath10 } e^{\\frac{i}{2 } \\sum_{j > k } \\mathrm{sgn}(x_j - x_k ) \\theta(\\lambda_{p_j } - \\lambda_{p_k})}$ ] .",
    "the two - particle phase shifts are @xmath11 and @xmath12 denotes a permutation of @xmath8 indices . with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the eigenstates of the lieb - liniger hamiltonian with @xmath8 particles are specified by giving @xmath8 quantum numbers which are integers for @xmath8 odd and half - odd - integers for @xmath8 even .",
    "multiple occupation of quantum numbers is not allowed .",
    "in particular , the ground state is given by the quantum numbers @xmath13 , i.e. a fermi sea configuration .",
    "the quasi - momenta @xmath14 relate to the quantum numbers @xmath15 through the bethe equations as @xmath16 the total momentum of an eigenstate is @xmath17 and is zero for the ground state .",
    "the energy of an eigenstate is @xmath18 .    in the so - called tonks - girardeau limit",
    "@xmath19 @xcite , the system simplifies considerably , reducing to a gas of impenetrable bosons which , up to particle statistics , is equivalent to free fermions .",
    "we will use this limit later on as a separate check of our results .",
    "we will consider states in the lieb - liniger model corresponding to one or more intervals of occupied quantum numbers ( no holes ) and all other quantum numbers unoccupied .",
    "the simplest case is the ground state , corresponding to a single interval as described above . in general",
    ", we can think of a number of disjoint intervals @xmath20,\\ldots,[i_{nl},i_{nr}]$ ] .",
    "we will focus on the case of two intervals @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 $ ] in particular . as this type of state",
    "can be obtained by splitting the fermi sea , we will generally refer to it as a _",
    "moses _ state .",
    "some immediate facts concerning moses states are that their energy is thermodynamically large above that of the ground state , and their momentum distribution will be peaked around nonzero momenta ( namely at momenta dictated by the size of and distance between the fermi pockets ) , unlike the ground state case .",
    "moreover , the fact that these states have zero entropy maximizes quantum effects in observables such as correlation functions .",
    "such moses states were previously considered in @xcite where their local two and three body correlations were calculated ( similar correlations were computed in @xcite using the method of @xcite ) . as argued in @xcite , the momentum kick caricatures the effects of the bragg pulse performed in @xcite .",
    "of course the real experiment leads to a much more complicated initial state than a mere idealized moses state such as considered here .",
    "one could however imagine defining a generalized gibbs ensemble @xcite with the power - law charges of the lieb - liniger model , as in @xcite , specializing to a double - well generalized free energy leading to a description in terms of an ensemble of states in the vicinity of the moses state .",
    "the moses state would then be the zero - entropy limit of this gge .",
    "such a situation would differ from an equilibrium situation where the ground state consists of a split fermi sea , as occurs in certain phases of integrable spin ladder systems @xcite where the dressed energy obtains a double well shape .",
    "the difference lies in the fact that in reality , two hamiltonians have to be distinguished : the one setting the equilibrium / ensemble average , and the one driving the unitary quantum time evolution . in equilibrium",
    "these operators are identical . in a gge ( or similar ) description out of equilibrium",
    "however , this is not the case",
    ". this distinction does not matter for static quantities ( like the ones considered in @xcite ) , but does matter for dynamic ones as we study here , in which the lieb - liniger hamiltonian ( [ eq : lieblinigerh ] ) drives the time evolution , but the moses state emerges as the saddle - point state of some ( here left unspecified ) effective theory .",
    "let us establish some notations .",
    "we specify the particular moses state under study by listing the four extremal quantum numbers @xmath22 or the associated ` fermi momenta ' @xmath23 with @xmath24 . we will use indices @xmath25 to denote the two ` seas ' and indices @xmath26 to denote the edge of a sea .",
    "the extremal quantum numbers @xmath27 are mapped by the bethe equations to the quasi - momenta @xmath28 which become equal to @xmath29 in the tonks - girardeau limit .",

    "is shifted to the negative energy domain , leaving a characteristic excluded area as compared to the ground state case .",
    "the types of excitations that correspond to the different parts of the spectrum are also indicated .",
    "another difference compared to the ground state situation is that because of the negative energy branch the spectrum will become completely gapless if multiple particle - hole excitations are taken into account .",

    "vice versa _ ( see @xcite for the detailed explanations ) .",
    "we obtained the scaling numerically by explicitly evaluating the relevant matrix elements for increasing system size .",
    "this provides the prefactors , which combined with the effective parameters of the tomonaga - luttinger model obtained above , yield a completely parameter - free fit for the correlations away from the tonks - girardeau regime .",
    "in addition , the exponents are obtained efficiently from the scaling of the prefactors , providing an independent check on the parameters determined from finite size corrections to the spectrum or a different route to obtaining the correlation exponents . in figure [ fig : g2_changing_c_1 ] the density - density correlation for different values of @xmath52 as obtained from the dsf presented in figure  [ fig : dsf ] is shown . in figure",

    "one must be careful to take particle statistics into account .",
    "we therefore introduce a jordan - wigner string operator and define the boson annihilation operator as @xmath127 where @xmath128 has been defined in ( [ eq : psi_f ] ) .",
    "the physical density operator is given in equation .",
    "neglecting the fast fluctuating terms of the density operator under the integral , and using ( [ eq : chiraldensityop ] ) we find the expression @xmath129 leading to @xmath130 the one - body function is readily computed as @xmath131 where @xmath132 ^ 2,\\ ] ] with the notation @xmath133 .",

    "[ fig : g1_2 ] .    the sign @xmath136 in the jordan - wigner string operator shifts the momenta @xmath29 by @xmath137 to either the left or right .",
    "it absorbs the mismatch of the quantum number lattices in the bethe ansatz solution for even and odd numbers of particles : it corresponds to the choice of moving all occupied quantum numbers by a half to the left or to the right after removing a single particle from the system .",
    "the prefactors ( see fig . [",
    "fig : prefactors ] ) and the exponents both show the relative importance of the contributions with @xmath138 : these have a much larger contribution and decay more slowly .",
    "indeed , this clarifies the position of the peaks at @xmath139 in the momentum distribution function that were mentioned above .    from the expression for @xmath126 we find for small @xmath140 around @xmath141 the result @xmath142 in the limit of infinite repulsion",

    "the power law at zero momentum for a gas of bosons in the ground state is obtained from reduction to the conventional luttinger liquid , i.e. with @xmath96 given by eq .  .",

    ", the mdf decays as @xmath149 as expected from the logic of tan s contact @xcite .",
    "we have also directly verified this from the small-@xmath106 expansion of @xmath126 in the tonks - girardeau limit .     for a moses state for different values of the interaction as obtained from the numerical data of the momentum distribution function in fig .",

    "we have studied a particular class of highly - excited states in the lieb - liniger model , obtained by splitting the ground state fermi sea , giving finite different momentum to macroscopic subsets of atoms .",
    "these ` moses ' states possess a richer excitation spectrum than the ground state , and display a number of interesting features in their correlations , namely extra branches , critical power - law like behaviour and nontrivial threshold exponents .",
    "we have shown that the integrability - based results obtained could be very well fitted using a multicomponent tomonaga - luttinger description , whose effective parameters are set by energy ( and thus bethe ansatz - obtainable ) data . the threshold behavior can be studied in more detail ( explicitly giving the interaction and momentum - dependent threshold exponents ) by adapting methods from nonlinear luttinger liquid theory @xcite .",
    "it is completely straightforward to generalize our results to the case of multiple seas , although the computation of correlations becomes increasingly difficult .",
    "one interesting generalization is to consider ` thermal - like ' dressing of moses states .",
    "the ensemble of states thus obtained could be used to model the initial state immediately after a bragg pulse , as performed in the quantum newton s cradle experiment of @xcite .",
