    "the development of a single - atom maser allows a detailed study of the atom - field interaction@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the realization of a single - atom maser has been made possible due to the enormous progress in the construction of superconducting cavities together with the laser preparation of highly excited atoms called rydberg atoms .",
    "resonant effects@xcite associated to the coupling of atoms with strong radiofrequency field has been observed . in particular , it has been demonstrated that the spontaneous emission rate of an atom inside the cavity is different from its value in free space@xcite-@xcite .",
    "this effect can be discussed from several different approaches , e.g. , attributed it to a change of the spectral density of the modes of the vacuum radiation field due to the cavity s resonating structure .",
    "the theoretical understanding of these effects by making use of perturbation theory requires the calculation of very high - order terms .",
    "it makes the standard feynman diagram technique practically unreliable in the case . on the other side ,",
    "the nonlinear character of the problem involved in realistic situations can not be ignored simply . a naive solution of this difficulty may be to assume that under certain conditions , the coupled atom - radiation field system can be approximated by a system composed of a harmonic oscillator coupled linearly to the radiation field through some effective coupling constants .",
    "thus , a significant number of works have been sparked to the study of cavity qed .",
    "another motivation to study the radiation field system in cavity comes from the cosmology .",
    "astronomical observations@xcite-@xcite have provided plenty of supports to the cosmological principle@xcite , which states that the universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic on large scales .",
    "this principle implies that we can build up a comoving coordinate system , in which the spatial part has a maximal symmetry . in general",
    ", there are three types of global symmetry for the three - dimensional maximally symmetric space , _ i.e. _ , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "usually , they are called the flat , closed and open universe , respectively . in order to understand the evolution of the universe , the whole distribution and activity of matters ( including radiations ) in space have to be taken into account . and we would like to point out that , if properties of matters in space as a whole are to be studied , the difference of global symmetries should not be neglected . in particular , we know that the early epoch of the universe was governed by the radiation fields",
    ". therefore , a careful study of radiation fields in a compact space is necessary .    in free space ,",
    "it is well - known that the radiation fields can be described by an ideal gas model ( a thermodynamic system consisting of free massless particles ) .",
    "however , one can not extend this idea to the case of compact space straightforwardly . in order to investigate the quantum statistical properties of radiation fields in a compact space , we begin with constructing of the representation of one - particle states .",
    "we notice that the space - time @xmath4 is a conformally deformed de sitter space - time .",
    "this space - time has a translation symmetry in the time direction and six rotation symmetries in the spatial part .",
    "that is to say , the isometry group of the space - time @xmath4 is @xmath5 . by making use of the representation theory of this group",
    ", we get a representation of one - particle states as well as the corresponding dispersion relation for the radiation field .",
    "the density of state with respect to the energy spectrum is continuous in the case of the compact space with a large radius .",
    "it should be pointed out that the obtained density of state is different from that of a black body in free space .",
    "the geometrical parameter dependence of statistical properties of the radiation field system in a compact space can be obtained explicitly .",
    "it has been a goal of cavity qed for a long time .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will discuss the kinematics of the radiation fields in the compact space @xmath6 .",
    "the hilbert space of free photons as well as the corresponding dispersion relations is presented .",
    "the bose - einstein statistics of the radiation fields is intensively studied in section 3 .",
    "statistical properties of the radiation fields , which is remarkably different from that in free space , are shown .",
    "we then give the conclusions and remarks in section 4 .",
    "the metric of the compact space - time @xmath4 is of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the radius of the sphere @xmath6 .",
    "the spatial part of the metric , @xmath9 , can be expanded with euler angular variables @xmath10 or with a unit vector in the four - dimensional euclidean space @xmath11 the isometry group of the space - time is @xmath5 .",
    "infinitesimal elements of the isometry group can be expressed in terms of the following generators @xmath12 here @xmath13 denotes the hamiltonian and @xmath14 are angular momentums .",
    "the motion of a free photon is described by the klein - gordon equation @xmath15 here the dalembertian operator @xmath16 is an invariant of @xmath0 @xmath17 it is convenient to introduce the set of operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 as@xcite @xmath20 and their linear combinations , @xmath21 then , one can separate the @xmath22 lie algebra @xmath23 into two parts , which commutates with each other @xmath24 = 0~,\\nonumber\\\\ & & [ \\hat{j}_{\\alpha},~\\hat{j}_{\\beta } ] = i\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}\\hat{j}_{\\gamma}~,\\nonumber\\\\ & & [ \\hat{s}_{\\alpha},~\\hat{s}_{\\beta } ] = i\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}\\hat{s}_{\\gamma}~,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\frac{1}{2}\\hat{m}^{ij}\\hat{m}_{ij } = \\hat{p}^2+\\hat{l}^2= 2(\\hat{j}^2+\\hat{s}^2)~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in other words , the @xmath2 group can be expressed locally as a direct product of two @xmath25 groups .",
    "nevertheless , it is easy to see that , @xmath26 and then , we obtain the representation of the @xmath22 universal lie algebra @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30  .",
    "the representation of the translation group @xmath31 is of the form @xmath32 now we can write the wave - function @xmath33 into the form @xmath34 denotes the degrees of freedom of spin . the corresponding dispersion relation for this eigen - state",
    "is given by eqs .",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath37 the hilbert space of a free photon can therefore be parameterized as @xmath38 statistical properties of radiation fields ------------------------------------------    to conveniently study statistical properties of the radiation fields in a compact space , one should compute the density of state for energy spectrum first . the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] ) can be rewritten into the following form @xmath39r^{-2}=k^2-r^{-2}~,\\ ] ] where we have introduced @xmath40 for convenience .    for a given energy level @xmath41 ,",
    "the value of @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) is determined .",
    "there exist @xmath44 eigen - states at this energy level resulted by summing over the index parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "if the scale of the radius @xmath8 is large enough , one can regard the spectrum of energy and @xmath42 as a continuous distribution .",
    "then , we get a measure of states with respect to the energy spectrum , which is just the density of state , @xmath47 the density of state is obviously different from that of the ordinary black - body radiation system in free space , which is proportional to the square of energy ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the photons obey the bose - einstein statistics .",
    "the mean number of photons on an eigen - state with energy @xmath41",
    "is@xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the temperature of this system to be zero and hence @xmath51 . ] .",
    "immediately , we obtain a modified planck distribution for the radiation fields in the compact space @xmath6 , @xmath52 the distribution function represents the amount of radiation energy in the spectral interval @xmath53 and a unit volume . in picture * 1 * , we give a sketch for this modified planck distribution comparing with the ordinary one in free space .",
    "[ pic ]     ( real line , @xmath54 ) and the ordinary distribution of a black - body radiation system in free space ( dashed line).,width=377,height=264 ]    the total number of photons of the radiation system can be expressed as @xmath55 when the parameter @xmath56 runs to infinity , we recover the familiar result of the black - body radiation system in free space . in the follows",
    ", we will calculate quantities by expanding them in terms of @xmath57 to see clearly the deviation from those got in free space .",
    "the thermodynamic quantity of total energy is @xmath58 where @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is the riemann zeta - function .",
    "the free energy and thermodynamic potential can also be calculated easily , @xmath61 we know that the volume of the three - dimensional sphere with radius @xmath8 is @xmath62 .",
    "hence the radiation pressure is @xmath63 furthermore , by making use of the relations among thermodynamic quantities @xmath64 we can obtain the entropy of radiation fields @xmath65    in an adiabatic process experienced by the radiation fields , the entropy does nt change .",
    "so the product @xmath56 can be viewed as a constant in the process .",
    "the total number of photons is also kept invariant in the adiabatic process . but the other thermodynamic quantities will vary with the geometrical parameter @xmath8 as follows , @xmath66 to discuss the equation of state of this radiation system , we now calculate the density of thermal energy , @xmath67 the equation of state of the radiation fields in the compact space can be read out from eqs .",
    "( [ total - pressure ] ) and ( [ density - energy ] ) , @xmath68 it is obvious that , in the case of a large radius of the compact space , the ordinary equation of state for the radiation fields in free space can be recovered .",
    "a good understanding of the resonant effect and spontaneous emission rate difference in cavity requires first to know the full space dependence of the cavity - induced damping and level shifts .",
    "however , we know that it is a really difficult mathematical task . thus , many useful approximation methods have been developed . as a first step on the way of getting an exact solution of the problem , we suggested working on a compact space of finite size instead of a cavity . by making use of the representation theory of the @xmath5 group",
    ", we studied the kinematics for a free photon propagating in the space - time @xmath69 .",
    "the explicit geometrical parameter dependence of statistical properties of the radiation fields was presented .",
    "results showed remarkable differences from that of the black - body radiation in free space .",
    "the resonant effects associated to the coupling of atoms with strong radiofrequency field as well as the spontaneous emission rate can also be computed in a straightforward way .",
    "it is expected that the nonlinear character of the coupled atom - radiation field may be attributed to the geometrical parameters of the compact space .",
    "these results will be published in a forthcoming paper .",
    "in fact , the statistical properties of radiation fields in a compact space are crucial to the evolution of the early universe . in the early universe ,",
    "radiation field is the dominant matter",
    ". a bit difference of statistical properties of the radiation system can generate observable effects on our present cosmology .",
    "all of these studies are in progressing .",
