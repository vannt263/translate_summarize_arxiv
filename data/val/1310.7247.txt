    "over the last few decades , the increasing demand for wireless communications has motivated the exploration for more efficient usage of spectral resources ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it has been noticed that there are large portions of spectrum that are severely under - utilized @xcite .",
    "recently , cognitive radio technologies ( cr ) have been proposed as a means to intelligently use such spectrum opportunities by sensing the radio environment and exploiting available spectrum holes for secondary usage@xcite . in cr systems ,",
    "secondary users are allowed to `` borrow ( or lease ) '' the usage of spectrum from primary users ( licensed users ) , as long as they do not hinder in the proper operation of the primary users communications .",
    "unfortunately , as we move to make cr technologies commercial , which will allow secondary users to access spectrum owned by primary users , we will face the inevitable risk that adversaries will be tempted to use cr technology for illicit and selfish purposes @xcite .",
    "if we imagine an unauthorized user ( invader ) attempting to sneak usage of spectrum without obeying proper regulations or leasing the usage of the spectrum , the result will be that both legitimate secondary users and primary users will face unexpected interference , resulting in significant performance degradation across the system .",
    "the challenge of enforcing the proper usage of spectrum requires the notion of a `` spectrum policing agent '' , whose primary job is to ensure the proper usage of spectrum and identify anomalous activities occurring within the spectrum@xcite . as a starting point to being able to police the usage of spectrum , we must have the ability to scan spectrum and effectively identify anomalous activities . towards this objective ,",
    "there has been several research efforts in signal processing techniques that can be applied to the spectrum scanning problem .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the author s presented methods for detecting a desired signal contained within interference . similarly , detection of unknown signals in noise without prior knowledge of authorized users was studied in @xcite .",
    "as another example , in @xcite , the authors proposed a method to detect anomalous transmission by making use of radio propagation characteristics .",
    "in @xcite authors investigated what impact on spectrum scanning can have information about the over - arching application that a spectrum thief might try to run .",
    "however , these works tend to not examine the important `` interplay '' between the two participants inherent in the problem the invader , who is smart and will attempt to use the spectrum in a manner to minimize the chance of being detected and fined , while also striving to maximize the benefit he / she receives from illicit usage of this spectrum ; and the scanner , who must be smart and employ a strategy that strategically maximizes the chance of detecting and fining the smart invader , with minimal cost .",
    "this challenge is made more difficult by the complexity of the underlying scanning problem itself : there will be large swaths of bandwidth to scan , and the system costs ( e.g. analog - to - digital conversion , and the computation associated with running signal classifiers ) associated with scanning very wide bandwidth makes it impossible to scan the full range of spectrum in a single instance .",
    "consequently , it is important to understand the strategic dynamics that exist between the scanner and the invader , while also taking into account the underlying costs and benefits that exist for each participant",
    ". this paper examines the interactions between the scanner and invader by formulating the problem using game theory .",
    "we find the optimal scanning strategy by selecting the scanning ( and , similarly , the invading ) bandwidth that should be employed in spectrum scanning .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec : problem ] , we first define the problem by formulating a two - step game in terms of payoff and cost functions : in the first step , each player chooses their bandwidths ; while in the second step each player uses the first step results to arrive at equilibrium strategies .",
    "we supply saddle point strategies for the game s first step .",
    "to gain insight into the problem , for the second step , in section [ sec : linear ] , we outline a linearized model of detection probability and arrive at the corresponding best strategies for each player in section [ sec : best response ] .",
    "we then explicitly obtain the equilibrium strategies in sections [ sec : nash equilibrium ] and [ sec : nash equilibrium_unknown ] for cases involving complete and incomplete knowledge of the invader s reward type . in section [ sec : numerical illustrations ] numerical illustrations",
    "are supplied .",
    "finally , in sections [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : appendix ] discussions , conclusions and the proofs of the announced results are offered to close the paper .",
    "in this section we set up our problem formulation .",
    "our formulation of the spectrum scanning problem involves two players : the scanner and the invader .",
    "the scanner , who is always present in the system , scans a part of the band of frequencies that are to be monitored , in order to prevent illegal usage by a potential invader of the primary ( scanner ) network s ownership of this band .",
    "we assume that the amount of bandwidth that needs to be scanned is much larger than is possible using a single scan by the scanner , and hence the scanner faces a dilemma : the more bandwidth that is scanned , the higher the probability of detecting the invader , but at the expense of increasing the cost of the rf scanning system .",
    "we assume that if the scanner scans a particular frequency band @xmath0 and the invader uses the band @xmath1 then the invasion will be detected with certainty if @xmath2 , and it will not be detected otherwise . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that the size of the protected frequency band is normalized to 1 .",
    "the invader wants to use spectrum undetected for some illicit purpose .",
    "we consider two scenarios : ( a ) the reward for the invader is related to the width of the frequency band he uses if he is undetected .",
    "if he is detected he will be fined .",
    "so , the invader faces a dilemma : the more bandwidth he tries to use yields a larger payoff if he is not detected but also it increases the probability of being detected and thus to be fined , ( b ) the award for the invader is unknown to the scanner : he only knows whether it is related to the width of the frequency band the invader uses , or not .",
    "we formulate this problem as a two step game in the following two subsections .      in the first step of the game the scanner selects the band @xmath3\\subseteq [ 0,1]$ ] with a fixed upper bound of frequency width @xmath4 to scan i.e. @xmath5 .",
    "the invader selects the band @xmath6 \\subseteq [ 0,1]$ ] with a fixed upper bound frequency width @xmath7 to intrude , i.e. @xmath8 .",
    "so , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are pure strategies for the scanner and the invader .",
    "the scanner s payoff @xmath11 is 1 if the invader is detected ( i.e. @xmath12\\cap [ t_i , t_i+y]\\not=\\emptyset$ ] ) and his payoff is zero otherwise . the goal of the scanner is to maximize his payoff meanwhile the invader wants to minimize it .",
    "so , the scanner and the invader play a zero - sum game . the saddle point ( equilibrium ) of the game is a couple of strategies @xmath13 such that for each strategies @xmath14 the following inequalities hold @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the value of the game .",
    "it is clear that the game does not have a saddle point in the pure strategy if @xmath17 . to find the saddle point we have to extend the game by mixed strategies , where we assign a probability distribution over pure strategies",
    "then instead of the payoff @xmath16 we have its expected value .",
    "the game has a saddle point in mixed strategies , and let @xmath18 be the value of the game",
    ". then @xmath18 is the maximal detection probability of the invader under worst conditions .      in the second step of the game the rivals knowing their equilibrium strategies from the first step as well as detection probability @xmath18 , want to find the equilibrium frequency widths @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "we here consider two sub - scenarios : ( a ) the invader s type is known : namely , it is known how the reward for the invader is related to the width of the frequency band he uses if he is undetected , ( b ) the invader s type is unknown : instead , there is only a chance that the invader reward is related to the width in use , else it is not related .",
    "different type of rewards can be motivated by using different type of application ( say , file - download or streaming video @xcite ) .",
    "a strategy for the scanner is to scan a width of frequency of size @xmath19 $ ] , and a strategy for the invader is to employ a width of frequency of size @xmath20 $ ] , where @xmath21 .",
    "so , we assume that the invader s technical characteristics is not better than the scanner s ones .    if the scanner and the invader use the strategies @xmath4 and @xmath7 , then the payoff to the invader is the expected award ( which is a function @xmath22 of bandwidth @xmath7 illegally used by the invader ) minus intrusion expenses ( which is a function @xmath23 of bandwidth @xmath7 ) and expected fine @xmath24 to pay , i.e. @xmath25    the scanner wants to detect intrusion taking into account scanning expenses and damaged caused by the illegal use of the bandwidth . for detection he is rewarded by fined @xmath24 imposed on the invader .",
    "thus , the payoff to the scanner is difference between the expected reward for detection , and damaged from intrusion into the bandwidth ( which is a function @xmath26 of bandwidth @xmath7 illegally used by the invader ) with the scanning expenses ( which is a function @xmath27 of scanned bandwidth @xmath4 ) , @xmath28 note that introducing transmission cost is common for cdma @xcite and aloha networks ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the scanner and the invader know fine @xmath24 , cost functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the scanner and invader s utilities @xmath31 and @xmath32 as well as low and upper bandwidth bounds @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ". we look for a nash equilibrium , i.e. for a couple of strategies @xmath36 such that for any couple of strategies @xmath37 the following inequalities hold @xcite : @xmath38      in this section we assume that the invader can be of two types : ( a ) with probability @xmath39 he can be the same as in the previous section , and so @xmath7 is his strategy and payoffs are given by ( [ ee_a_0 ] ) , ( b ) with probability @xmath40 for him it is just important to work in the network without being detected .",
    "then , of course , he will employ the minimal bandwidth allowed , so his strategy is @xmath41 .",
    "the payoff to the scanner is the expected payoff taking into account the _ type _ of invader : @xmath42 with @xmath43 given by ( [ ee_b ] ) .",
    "here we also look for nash equilibrium .",
    "we assume that the scanner and the invader know ( as in the case with complete information ) the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 as well as the probability @xmath39 .",
    "in the following theorem we gives the equilibrium strategies for the first step , so for fixed upper bound width of the rivals .",
    "[ th_1 ] in the first step with fixed width to scan @xmath4 and to invade @xmath7 , the rivals employ uniform tiling behavior .",
    "namely ,    \\(a ) let @xmath44 with @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the greatest integer less or equal to @xmath47 . then the scanner and the invader will , with equal probability @xmath48 , employ a band of the set @xmath49 and @xmath50 correspondingly .",
    "\\(b ) let @xmath51 .",
    "then the scanner and the invader will , with equal probability @xmath52 , employ a band of the set @xmath53 and @xmath54 correspondingly , where    @xmath55 , k=1, ... ,m\\},\\\\ a_{-i}&=\\{[k(x+y)-y-\\epsilon ( m+1-k),k(x+y)-\\epsilon ( m - k)],\\\\ & k=1 , ... , m\\ } , \\quad 0<\\epsilon < x / m , \\\\ a_{+s}&=a_{-s}\\cup",

    "in this section , which is split into four subsections , we find the equilibrium strategy for the second step explicitly .",
    "first in subsection  [ sec : linear ] we linearize our model to get an explicit solution , then in subsection  [ sec : best response ] the best response strategies are given for known invader type , and they are employed in subsections  [ sec : nash equilibrium ] and  [ sec : nash equilibrium_unknown ] to construct equilibrium strategies for known and unknown invader types correspondingly .      in order to get an insight into the problem , we consider a situation where the detection s probability @xmath18 for @xmath57 $ ] is approximated by a linear function as follows : @xmath58 we assume that the scanning and intrusion cost as well as the invader s and scanner s utilities are linear in the bandwidth involved , i.e. @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 . then the payoffs to the invader and the scanner , if they use strategies @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 $ ] respectively , become :    @xmath64 note that linearized payoffs have found extensive usage for a wide array of problems in wireless networks @xcite .",
    "of course , such approach simplifies the original problem and only gives an approximated solution",
    ". meanwhile it can also be very useful : sometimes it allows one to obtain solution explicitly , and allows one to look inside of the structure of the solution as well as the correlation between parameters of the system .",
    "in this section we give best response strategies for the scanner and the invader , i.e. such strategies that @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "[ th_br ] in the second step of the game the scanner and the invader have the best response strategies @xmath67 and @xmath68 are given as follows :    @xmath69 , &   y=(c_s - f)/v,\\\\ b , &   y>(c_s - f)/v , \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    @xmath70    with @xmath71      the equilibrium in the second step of the problem exists since the payoff to the scanner is linear on @xmath4 and the payoff to the invader is concave on @xmath7",
    ". the equilibrium can be found by ( [ e_ne ] ) as a couple of strategies @xmath37 which are the best response to each other , i.e. @xmath72 and @xmath73 , i.e. the intersection of the best response curves ( figure  [ fig_0 ] ) .",
    "such intersection always exists and is unique as shown in the following theorem .     the nash equilibrium as an intersection of the best response curves , scaledwidth=24.0% ]    [ th_2 ] let the invader s award be related to the width of band in use .",
    "this game has unique nash equilibrium in the second step , and it is given by table  [ tbl1 ] with @xmath74    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      for marginal probabilities of the problem with unknown invader s type ( where indeed there is complete confidence in the invader s type ) we already have the solution .",
    "namely , if @xmath75 then the invaders reward depends on width in use .",
    "so , the equilibrium is unique and given by theorem  [ th_2 ] . if @xmath76 then the invaders reward does not depend on width in use .",
    "thus , the equilibrium is unique again and it is @xmath77 . for",
    "the inside probabilities the equilibrium is given by the following theorem    [ th_3 ] let it be unknown whether the invader s award is related to the bandwidth used .",
    "this game has unique nash equilibrium in the second step , and it is given by table  [ tbl1 ] with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "as a numerical illustration of the scenario when the invader s reward depends on the bandwidth in use we consider @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "figures  [ fig_1 ] and  [ fig_2 ] demonstrate the equilibrium strategies as a function of the fine @xmath24 for the invader s characteristics @xmath85 .",
    "increasing fine makes the scanner and the invader employ larger and smaller bands correspondingly .",
    "the scanner would alter his strategy by a sudden jump at a threshold value ( @xmath86 for @xmath87 ) . in spite of the fact that the invader would vary his strategy continuously ,",
    "his payoff experiences a sudden drop .",
    "this also leads to an increase in detection probability by a jump .",
    "since the scanner already gets the upper band , while the invader still does not get to the lower band , further increasing of the fine leads to continuous decreasing of the detection probability due to the smaller bandwidth employed by the invader ( figure  [ fig_3 ] ) .",
    "equilibrium strategy @xmath4 and @xmath7 when the invader s reward depends on the bandwidth in use , scaledwidth=24.0% ]     the equilibrium payoffs @xmath88 and @xmath89 when the invader s reward depends on the bandwidth in use , scaledwidth=24.0% ]     probability of detection when the invader s reward depends on the bandwidth in use , scaledwidth=24.0% ]    figure  [ fig_4 ] and  [ fig_5 ] demonstrate the equilibrium strategies as a function of probability @xmath39 ( i.e. uncertainty about the invader s reward type ) and fine @xmath90 .",
    "the result essentially depends on the invader s characteristics .",
    "for @xmath91 the equilibrium strategies do not depend on the probability @xmath39 .",
    "for @xmath92 they are constant for @xmath93 , while increasing of the scanner strategy by a jump at switching point @xmath94 drops also the invader s payoff by a jump .",
    "this `` jumping nature '' for the invader s payoff means that when assigning a fine one has to take into account the fact that sometimes a simple increase in fine might not change the invader s behavior , but that once a threshold value is hit , his behavior will change dramatically .     equilibrium strategy @xmath4 and @xmath7 with uncertainty about the invader s award , scaledwidth=24.0% ]     the equilibrium payoffs @xmath88 and @xmath89 with uncertainty about the invader s award , scaledwidth=24.0% ]     probability of detection with uncertainty about the invader s award , scaledwidth=24.0% ]",
    "in this paper we suggest a simple model of finding the optimal bandwidth to scan for detection of an invader and found the solution of this model explicitly .",
    "we have shown that the optimal width essentially depends on the scenario and under some conditions a small varying of network parameters and fine could lead to jump changes in the optimal strategies , as well as in the payoffs of the rivals .",
    "this mixture between continuous and discontinuous behavior of the invader under the influence of fine implies that the network provider has to carefully make a value judgement : some threshold values of fine could have a huge impact on the invader , while in the other situations a small increase will have a minimal impact on the strategies used .",
    "a goal for our future investigation , of course , is to investigate the non - linearized detection probability .",
    "also , since our investigation showed that the optimal scanning essentially depends on the invader s characteristics , we intend to extend our model to the case of incomplete information on the characteristics as well as to multi - scanner @xcite or multi - invader systems @xcite .",
