    "it has been suggested that theories with extra dimensions may provide a solution to the hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "the idea is to introduce a @xmath4-dimensional internal space of large physical volume @xmath5 , so that the the effective lower dimensional planck mass @xmath6 is much larger than @xmath7- the true fundamental scale of the theory . in the original scenarios , only gravity was allowed to propagate in the higher dimensional bulk , whereas all other matter fields were confined to live on a lower dimensional brane .",
    "randall and sundrum @xcite ( rs ) introduced a particularly attractive model where the gravitational field created by the branes is taken into account .",
    "their background solution consists of two parallel flat branes , one with positive tension and another with negative tension embedded in a a five - dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) bulk . in this model ,",
    "the hierarchy problem is solved if the distance between branes is about @xmath8 times the ads radius and we live on the negative tension brane .",
    "more recently , scenarios where additional fields propagate in the bulk have been considered @xcite .    in principle , the distance between branes is a massless degree of freedom , the radion field @xmath0 .",
    "however , in order to make the theory compatible with observations this radion must be stabilized @xcite .",
    "clearly , all fields which propagate in the bulk will give casimir - type contributions to the vacuum energy , and it seems natural to investigate whether these could provide the stabilizing force which is needed .",
    "in this paper , we shall calculate the radion effective potential @xmath9 due to kk gravitons and other massless bulk fields .",
    "as we shall see , this effective potential has a rather non - trivial behaviour , which generically develops a local extremum .",
    "depending on the detailed matter content , the extremum could be a maximum or a minimum , where the radion could sit .",
    "for the purposes of illustration , here we shall concentrate on the background geometry discussed by randall and sundrum , although our methods are also applicable to other geometries , such as the one introduced by ovrut et al . in the context of eleven",
    "dimensional supergravity with one large extra dimension @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model and conventions . in section iii",
    "we calculate the effective potential due to conformally invariant bulk fields , and discuss the stabilization mechanism .",
    "conformally invariant fields are convenient because of their simplicity , which allows a quick derivation of their contribution .",
    "moreover , the backreaction of the casimir energy on the geometry can be taken into consideration in this case .",
    "section iv is devoted to the graviton contribution . for gravitons ,",
    "conformal invariance is lost , and the evaluation of the effective potential is not straightforward .",
    "a method will be developed which relates the curved space effective potential to a suitable effective potential in flat space .",
    "the later takes the form of a sum over the contributions of an infinite tower of massive kk fields , whose mass spectrum @xmath10 is a function of the brane separation ( the discrete index @xmath11 labels the infinite kk tower ) .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section v.    related calculations of the casimir interaction amongst branes have been presented in an interesting paper by fabinger and horava @xcite . in the concluding section we shall comment on the differences between their results and ours .",
    "to be definite , we shall focus attention on the brane - world model introduced by randall and sundrum @xcite . in this model",
    "the metric in the bulk is anti - de sitter space ( ads ) , whose ( euclidean ) line element is given by @xmath12      = dy^2+a^2(z)d{\\bf x}^2 . \\label{rsmetric}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the ads radius .",
    "the branes are placed at arbitrary locations which we shall denote by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where the positive and negative signs refer to the positive and negative tension branes respectively ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the `` canonically normalized '' radion modulus @xmath0 - whose kinetic term contribution to the dimensionally reduced action on the positive tension brane is given by @xmath18 -is related to the proper distance @xmath19 between both branes in the following way @xcite @xmath20 here , @xmath7 is the fundamental five - dimensional planck mass .",
    "it is usually assumed that @xmath21 .",
    "let us introduce the dimensionless radion @xmath22 which will also be refered to as _",

    ", @xmath26 is the small number responsible for the discrepancy between @xmath23 and @xmath27 .    at the classical level ,",
    "the radion is massless .",
    "however , as we shall see , bulk fields give rise to a casimir energy which depends on the interbrane separation .",
    "this induces an effective potential @xmath9 which by convention we take to be the energy density per unit physical volume on the positive tension brane , as a function of @xmath0 .",

    "let us start by considering the contribution to @xmath9 from conformally invariant massless bulk fields .",
    "technically , this is much simpler than finding the contribution from bulk gravitons which will be discussed in the next section .",
    "moreover the problem of backreaction of the casimir energy onto the background can be taken into consideration in this case .",
    "consider , for instance , a conformally coupled scalar @xmath30 .",
    "this obeys the equation of motion @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the dalembertian operator in the metric ( [ rsmetric ] ) and @xmath33 is the ricci scalar . here",
    ", we consider the case of arbitrary odd spacetime dimension @xmath34 , with branes of co - dimension one . by changing the variable @xmath35 ,",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath30 becomes @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the _ flat space _ dalembertian .",
    "it is customary to impose @xmath38 symmetry on the bulk fields , which results in neumann boundary conditions @xmath39 at @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the dalembertian subject to these conditions are given by @xmath40 where @xmath11 is a positive integer , @xmath41 is the coordinate distance between both branes and @xmath42 is the coordinate momentum parallel to the branes .",
    "similarly , we could consider the case of massless fermions in the rs background .",
    "the dirac equation is conformally invariant @xcite , and the conformally rescaled components of the fermion obey the flat space equation ( [ fse ] ) with neumann boundary conditions .",
    "thus , the spectrum ( [ flateigenvalues ] ) is also valid for massless fermions .",
    "let us now consider the casimir energy density in the conformally related flat space problem .",
    "we shall first look at the effective potential per unit area on the brane , @xmath43 . for bosons ,",
    "this is given @xmath44 here @xmath45 is an arbitrary renormalization scale . using zeta function regularization [ see e.g. @xcite , or the discussion in section iv for details ] , it is straightforward to show that @xmath46 here @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the standard riemann s zeta function .",
    "the contribution of a massless fermion is given by the same expression but with opposite sign : @xmath49 the expectation value of the energy momentum tensor is traceless in flat space for conformally invariant fields moreover , because of the symmetries of our background , it must have the form @xcite @xmath50 by the conservation of energy - momentum , @xmath51 must be a constant , given by @xmath52 where the minus and plus signs refer to bosons and fermions respectively and we have introduced @xmath53    now , let us consider the curved space case . since the bulk is of odd dimension ,",
    "there is no anomaly @xcite and the energy momentum tensor is traceless in the curved case too .",
    "this tensor is related to the flat space one by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath54 hence , the energy density is given by @xmath55 the effective potential per unit physical volume on the positive tension brane is thus given by @xmath56 note that the background solution @xmath13 has only been used in the very last step .",
    "the previous expression for the effective potential takes into account the casimir energy of the bulk , but it is not complete because in general the effective potential receives additional contributions from both branes . as we shall discuss in more detail in section iv , we can always add to @xmath29 terms which correspond to finite renormalization of the tension on both branes .",
    "these are proportional to @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the coefficients in front of these two powers of @xmath26 can not be determined from our calculation and can only be fixed by imposing suitable renormalization conditions which relate them to observables . adding those terms and particularizing to the case of @xmath59 , we have @xmath60 , \\label{confveff}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 .",
    "the values @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be obtained from the observed value of the `` hierarchy '' , @xmath64 , and the observed value of the effective four - dimensional cosmological constant , which we take to be zero .",
    "thus , we take as our renormalization conditions @xmath65 if there are other bulk fields , such as the graviton , which give additional classical or quantum mechanical contributions to the radion potential , then those should be included in @xmath29 . from the renormalization conditions ( [ renc ] ) the unknown coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be found , and then the mass of the radion is calculable . in fig .",
    "1 we plot ( [ confveff ] ) for a fermionic field and a chosen value of @xmath64 .",
    "= 10 cm + [ fig5 ]    from ( [ renc ] ) , we have @xmath66 these values correspond to changes @xmath67 on the positive and negative brane tensions which are related by the equation @xmath68 as we shall see below , eq .",
    "( [ reltensions ] ) is just what is needed in order to have a static solution according to the five dimensional equations of motion , once the casimir energy is included .",
    "we can now calculate the mass of the radion field @xmath69 from the point of view of the negative tension brane .",
    "for @xmath70 we have : @xmath71 the contribution to the radion mass squared is negative for bosons and positive for fermions .",
    "thus , depending on the matter content of the bulk , it is clear that the radion may be stabilized due to this effect .",
    "note , however , that if the `` observed '' interbrane separation is large , then the induced mass is small .",
    "so if we try to solve the hierarchy problem geometrically with a large internal volume , then @xmath64 is of order @xmath72 and the mass ( [ massconf ] ) is much smaller than the @xmath1 scale .",
    "such a light radion would seem to be in conflict with observations . in this case",
    "we must accept the existence of another stabilization mechanism ( perhaps classical or nonperturbative ) contributing a large mass to the radion .",
    "of course , another possibility is to have @xmath64 of order one , with @xmath27 and @xmath14 of order @xmath23 , in which case the radion mass ( [ massconf ] ) would be very large , but then we must look for a different solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "due to conformal invariance , it is straightforward to take into account the backreaction of the casimir energy on the geometry",
    ". first of all , we note that the metric ( [ rsmetric ] ) is analogous to a friedmann - robertson - walker metric , where the nontrivial direction is space - like instead of timelike .",
    "the dependence of @xmath73 on the transverse direction can be found from the friedmann equation @xmath74 here a prime indicates derivative with respect to the proper coordinate @xmath75 [ see eq .",
    "( [ rsmetric ] ) ] , and @xmath76 is the background cosmological constant . combined with ( [ dilute ] ) , which relates the energy density @xmath77 to the scale factor @xmath73 , eq .",
    "( [ friedmann ] ) becomes a first order ordinary differential equation for @xmath73 .",
    "we should also take into account the matching conditions at the boundaries @xmath78 a static solution of eqs .",
    "( [ friedmann ] ) and ( [ matching ] ) can be found by a suitable adjustment of the brane tensions . indeed ,",
    "since the branes are flat , the value of the scale factor on the positive tension brane is conventional and we may take @xmath79 .",
    "now , the tension @xmath80 can be chosen quite arbitrarily .",
    "once this is done , eq .",
    "( [ matching ] ) determines the derivative @xmath81 , and eq .",
    "( [ friedmann ] ) determines the value of @xmath51 . in turn",
    ", @xmath51 determines the co - moving interbrane distance @xmath82 , and hence the location of the second brane . finally , integrating ( [ friedmann ] ) up to the second brane",
    ", the tension @xmath83 must be adjusted so that the matching condition ( [ matching ] ) is satisfied .",
    "thus , as with other stabilization scenarios , a single fine - tuning is needed in order to obtain a vanishing four - dimensional cosmological constant .",
    "this is in fact the dynamics underlying our choice of renormalization conditions ( [ renc ] ) which we used in order to determine @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "indeed , let us write @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the absolute value of the tension of the branes in the zeroth order background solution .",
    "elliminating @xmath87 from ( [ matching ] ) and ( [ friedmann ] ) , we easily recover the relation ( [ reltensions ] ) , which had previously been obtained by extremizing the effective potential and imposing zero effective four - dimensional cosmological constant ( here , @xmath88 is treated as a small parameter , so that extremization of the effective action coincides with extremization of the effective potential on the background solution . ) in that picture , the necessity of a single fine tuning is seen as follows .",
    "the tension on one of the walls can be chosen quite arbitrarily .",
    "for instance , we may freely pick a value for @xmath63 , which renormalizes the tension of the brane located at @xmath16 .",
    "once this is given , the value of the interbrane distance @xmath64 is fixed by the first of eqs .",
    "( [ consts ] ) .",
    "then , the value of @xmath62 , which renormalizes the tension of the brane at @xmath15 , must be fine - tuned to satisfy the second of eqs .",
    "( [ renc ] ) .",
    "( [ friedmann ] ) and ( [ matching ] ) can of course be solved nonperturbatively .",
    "we may consider , for instance , the situation where there is no background cosmological constant ( @xmath89 ) . in this case",
    "we easily obtain @xmath90 where the brane tensions are given by @xmath91 and @xmath92 is a constant .",
    "this is a self - consistent solution where the warp in the extra dimension is entirely due to the casimir energy .",
    "since the graviton is not conformally invariant , the techniques needed in order to find its contribution to the effective potential will have to be somewhat more sophisticated . however , because of the relevance of the graviton , it seems worthwile to pursue this task and in the following subsections we develop a convenient method to address this calculation .",
    "this consists of two steps . in subsection",
    "iv.a we relate the curved space effective potential to a suitable flat space determinant .",
    "the calculation of this determinant is then presented in section iv.b .    our background has maximally symmetric foliations orthogonal to the @xmath75 direction , and just like in the case of cosmological friedmann - robertson - walker models , each graviton polarization contributes as a massless minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "although this seems to be a well known fact which is often quoted in the literature , it is not always clear from the context what is the extent of this equivalence .",
    "the correspondence is straightforward at the classical level . at the quantum level , it can also be shown to hold , although this is not so straightforward to prove because careful gauge - fixing of the gravitational sector must be done .",
    "a detailed justification is lengthy , and will be presented elsewhere @xcite .    in short ,",
    "the correspondence is as follows .",
    "perturbations of the gravitational field in the randall - sundrum gauge can be expressed as @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 is a constant transverse and traceless polarization tensor ( a fourier decomposition of @xmath96 is assumed along the branes , in order to define transverse polarization ) .",
    "the summation is taken over all polarizations .",
    "the quadratic reduced action for one particular polarization becomes @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the usual covariant scalar laplacian associated with the five dimensional metric @xmath99 and we omitted the index @xmath100 .",
    "thus , we shall be interested in the determinant of the operator @xmath101 with appropriate boundary conditions at the branes . these are determined from israel s junction conditions plus the requirement of @xmath38 symmetry @xcite .",
    "equivalently , they can be found from the equation of motion for @xmath96 in the rs background .",
    "it is easy to show that in terms of @xmath96 , they reduce to the standard neumann boundary conditions i.e. , @xmath102 at @xmath103 .",
    "our next task is to evaluate the determinant of the covariant dalembertian operator @xmath104 defined in ( [ pdef ] ) .",
    "formally , this is the product of its eigenvalues .",
    "nevertheless , in the present case , a straightforward calculation involving the eigenvalues of @xmath104 seems rather complicated and not particularly illuminating .",
    "for instance , the eigenvalues of @xmath104 are completely unrelated to the spectrum of kaluza - klein gravitons , and so the contribution from individual physical modes seems hard to identify .",
    "a more promising strategy is to express @xmath105 in terms of the determinant of an operator whose eigenvalues are directly related to the kk masses . for this purpose , we introduce a one parameter family of metrics which interpolates between flat space and our physical space , @xmath106 for definiteness we shall take @xmath107 where the parameter @xmath108 runs from @xmath109 to @xmath110 . for @xmath111 the fictitious metric @xmath112 is flat space , whereas for @xmath113 it coincides with the physical metric .",
    "the arguments presented in this section are independent of the precise form of the `` path '' ( see fig .",

    "the renormalized couplings in front of these local terms are in fact supposed to be negligibly small ( they have not been included in the equations of motion satisfied by the background ) , so the terms proportional to @xmath200 might as well be dropped from @xmath153 .",
    "on the other hand , we can always add to @xmath153 terms which correspond to a finite renormalization of the cosmological constant in the bulk .",
    "these will give contributions proportional to @xmath201 .",
    "also , one can add terms which correspond to a finite renormalizaton of the tension on the branes . these will give independent contributions proportional to @xmath202 from the positive tension brane and to @xmath58 from the negative tension brane .",
    "hence , the coefficients in front of these two powers of @xmath26 can not be determined from the calculation and can only be fixed by imposing suitable renormalization conditions which relate them to observables .    by using ( [ conformal ] ) with the results ( [ int1 ] ) or ( [ int2 ] ) obtained in the preceding section , we can now evaluate @xmath167 . as mentioned at the end of the last subsection ,",
    "the explicit calculation of the generalized seeley - de witt coefficients is not strictly necessary .",
    "it is known that @xmath146 for odd @xmath34 has only contribution from the terms depending on the background quantities evaluated on the boundaries .",
    "therefore , the shift in the effective potential due to the variation of @xmath108 must be given by the sum of a function of @xmath15 plus a function of @xmath16 : @xmath203 imposing that @xmath167 has the correct scaling behaviour given in eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , the functional form @xmath204 is determined up to the two coefficients in front of @xmath57 and @xmath58 mentioned above , which have the same @xmath26 dependence as cosmological constants on the respective branes .",

    "an example of an effective potential after these conditions have been imposed is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath206 is the effective potential per unit physical volume on the positive tension brane , which appears in eq .",

    "the physical mass of the radion from the point of view of the negative tension brane is given by @xmath211 for the case of the graviton considered here , this mass squared is negative ( this is shown here for small @xmath64 , but it is in fact true for all @xmath64 ) , and therefore the graviton can not by itself stabilize the radion .    as we have seen in section ii , in theories where additional fields can propagate in the bulk",
    ", some of them may give positive contributions to the mass squared . in fact , for a small @xmath64 , the contribution of conformally invariant fermions @xmath212 , studied in section ii , is much more important than that of gravitons , which scales as @xmath213 .",
    "we have shown that in brane - world scenarios with a warped extra dimension , it is in principle possible to stabilize the radion @xmath0 through the casimir force induced by bulk fields .",
    "in particular , conformally invariant fields induce an effective potential of the form ( [ confveff ] ) as measured from the positive tension brane . from the point of view of the negative tension brane",
    ", this corresponds to an energy density per unit physical volume of the order @xmath214,\\ ] ] where @xmath215 is a calculable number ( of order @xmath216 per degree of freedom ) , and @xmath217 is the dimensionless radion . here @xmath27 is the higher - dimensional planck mass , and @xmath14 is the ads radius , which are both assumed to be of the same order , whereas @xmath23 is the lower - dimensional planck mass . in the absence of any fine - tuning , the potential will have an extremum at @xmath218 , where the radion may be stabilized ( at a mass of order @xmath23 ) .",
    "however , this stabilization scenario without fine - tuning would not explain the hierarchy between @xmath23 and the @xmath1 .",
    "a hierarchy can be generated by adjusting @xmath63 according to ( [ consts ] ) , with @xmath219 ( of course one must also adjust @xmath62 in order to have vanishing four - dimensional cosmological constant ) .",
    "but with these adjustement , the mass of the radion would be very small , of order @xmath220 therefore , in order to make the model compatible with observations , an alternative mechanism must be invoked in order to stabilize the radion , giving it a mass of order @xmath1 .",
    "goldberger and wise @xcite , for instance , introduced a field @xmath221 with suitable classical potential terms in the bulk and on the branes . in this model ,",
    "the potential terms on the branes are chosen so that the v.e.v .",
    "of the field in the positive tension brane @xmath222 is different from the v.e.v . on the negative tension brane @xmath223 .",
    "thus , there is a competition between the potential energy of the scalar field in the bulk and the gradient which is necessary to go from @xmath222 to @xmath223 .",
    "the radion sits at the value where the sum of gradient and potential energies is minimized .",
    "this mechanism is perhaps somewhat _ ad hoc _ , but it has the virtue that a large hierarchy and an acceptable radion mass can be achieved without much fine tuning .",
    "it is reassuring that in this case the casimir contributions , given by ( [ smallmass ] ) , would be very small and would not spoil the model .",
    "we have also calculated the graviton contribution to the radion effective potential .",
    "since gravitons are not conformally invariant , the calculation is considerably more involved , and a suitable method has been developed for this purpose .",
    "the result is that gravitons contribute a negative term to the radion mass squared , but this term is even smaller than ( [ smallmass ] ) , by an extra power of @xmath64 .    in an interesting recent paper @xcite , fabinger and horava",
    "have considered the casimir force in a brane - world scenario similar to the one discussed in this paper , where the internal space is topologically @xmath224 . in their case , however , the gravitational field of the branes is ignored and the extra dimension is not warped . as a result ,",
    "their effective potential is monotonic and stabilization does not occur ( at least in the regime where the one loop calculation is reliable , just like in the original kaluza - klein compactification on a circle @xcite ) .",
    "the question of gravitational backreaction of the casimir energy onto the background geometry is also discussed in @xcite . again , since the gravitational field of the branes is not considered , they do not find static solutions .",
    "this is in contrast with our case , where static solutions can be found by suitable adjustment of the brane tensions .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that the treatment of backreaction ( here and in @xcite ) applies to conformally invariant fields but not to gravitons .",
    "gravitons are similar to minimally coupled scalar fields , for which it is well known that the casimir energy density diverges near the boundaries @xcite .",
    "therefore , a physical cut - off related to the brane effective width seems to be needed so that the energy density remains finite everywhere . presumably , our conclusions will be unchanged provided that this cut - off length is small compared with the interbrane separation , but further investigation of this issue would be interesting .",
