    "however , the calculations reported in refs .",
    "@xcite for other weak reactions on light nuclei show that besides the one  nucleon contribution , meson exchange current ( mec ) effects should be taken into account .",

    "table  [ iaj ] shows the contributions of the current components to the effective couplings , and it can be seen that @xmath8 makes an important contribution to @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    here",

    "the weak axial nuclear mec operator satisfies the nuclear continuity equation ( pcac ) up to the order considered , which is @xmath9 ( m is the nucleon mass ) .",
    "the space - like component of the operator contains both static and velocity dependent parts .",
    "we take into account fully both the static part and the terms linear in external momenta from the velocity dependent part .",
    "further , we use for the vector part of the weak mec operator the standard isovector currents well known from the electromagnetic processes  @xcite .",
    "we employ non  relativistic operators satisfying cvc at order @xmath10 .",
    "a brief account of the work has been recently reported in ref .",

    "we present the full results . in section  [ forma ] , we discuss the formalism employed , section  [ resul ] contains the numerical analysis of the studied problem and in section  [ concl ] we give our conclusions .",
    "the most important of them is that including the weak axial and vector @xmath11-mec in the microscopic calculation yields results which agree closely with the epm in their predictions for observables .    in order to make the paper more transparent",

    "to evaluate the effect of meson exchange currents , the @xmath12 weak nuclear current was parameterized by six @xmath13 dependent current amplitudes @xmath14 and @xmath15 as follows .",

    "the current amplitudes are not relativistically invariant and are not independent ( if we make the assumption that second class currents are absent ) . to see the non - independence note that the epm parameterizes the current using only four form factors whereas there are six current amplitudes .",

    "for example , the gamow - teller matrix element is 1/4 @xmath39 .",
    "the matrix elements are reduced in the spin - spatial part but not in the isospin part so that for example , @xmath40 @xmath41 the following selection rules were applied to the matrix elements",

    "@xmath48 this implies that only @xmath49 is significant and for @xmath50 only @xmath51 is significant .",
    "a numerical example is @xmath52 .",
    "selection rule for @xmath53 .",
    "if the spin - isospin part of the operator is even(odd ) under the interchange or particle labels 2 and 3 then only matrix elements for which @xmath53 is even(odd ) are significant e.g.  @xmath54 requires @xmath55 .",
    "this selection rule follows from the symmetry of the wavefunctions under interchange of particle labels .",
    "a selection rule peculiar to the @xmath56 type matrix elements is that @xmath57 is zero by interchange of particle labels 1 and 2 .",
    "further to the selection rules a rationalization of the matrix elements was possible by taking into account the long wavelength of the @xmath58 boson mediating the interaction , the low p - state probability ( @xmath59 ) and the @xmath60 d - state probability in the trion wavefunctions . with regard to the first point",
    "we note that the isovector spectator point - particle range is about 1.7 fm .",
    "this implies that matrix elements with high values of @xmath61 are small and that a power expansion in @xmath62 rapidly converges , e.g.  the @xmath63 term in @xmath64 contributes at the 3% level .",
    "the range of the pair coordinate @xmath65 is of the order of the pion compton wavelength , 1.4 fm , as can be seen from fig .  [ densities ] .",
    "this is expected because the exchange current operators pick out the spin and isospin dependence in the wavefunction which is mostly due to pion exchange .",
    "matrix elements with the factor @xmath66 will be small for large values of @xmath67 .",
    "integrals of the densities are given in table  [ meint ] .",
    "an example of rationalization is to consider the ratios @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we note that @xmath70 receives contributions solely from ss overlap . @xmath71 and",
    "@xmath72 are dominated by sd overlap and are thus diminished due to the lower d - state probability by a factor @xmath73 which explains the ratio of @xmath71 and @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath72 is further suppressed due to the low momentum transfer in the process by the @xmath74 factor factor showing that the effective momentum transfer for exchange currents is half as much as for single - nucleon currents . ]",
    "this explains why @xmath72 is so much smaller than @xmath71 .    for most local currents",
    "the leading multipoles plus those within one unit of angular momentum were included .",
    "this procedure neglects contributions at the 3% level . for the largest current ( delta excitation ) these 3% corrections were included .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath76 and @xmath77 were neglected since we expect their contributions to be small compared to those of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "they will be suppressed by about 15% due to angular momentum propensity rules . by parity",
    "we need an extra factor @xmath80 or @xmath81 to combine with @xmath82 . in the case of @xmath80",
    "this yields @xmath83 and these elements are suppressed as can be seen in table  [ meint ] . in the case of @xmath81 there will be suppression because of the @xmath84 factor of about 15% .",
    "the fact that we omit the non - local terms involving @xmath82 implies that our estimate of the non - local terms has an inherent uncertainty of about 10 - 20% .",
    "it turns out that the non - local currents due to @xmath85 contribute at the 10% level to the exchange currents and so the above neglect affects the results for the mec at the 1 - 2% level and the results for the total current at less than the 0.5% level .",
    "each exchange current yields a contribution to one , ( or more ) , of the current amplitudes and the general form is , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a nuclear density and @xmath88 is a ` potential function ' which depends on the meson which is exchanged , the overall coupling strength and also the momentum dependence of the current .",
    "the definitions of the various potential functions entering the calculation are given in appendix  [ apppot ] .",

    "we also give results for 8 and 22 channel wavefunctions from the av14 potential with the tuscon - melbourne three - body force ( cases ( c ) and ( d ) ) which show the effect of adding extra channels to the faddeev wavefunction .",

    "although a direct comparison of our results with  @xcite is not possible because a different coupling scheme was employed there ( our wavefunctions employ russell - saunders ls coupling rather than @xmath112 ) our 8 and their 5 channel wavefunctions have similar content and convergence of the binding energy requires 22 and 34 channels respectively .",
    "the extra channels change the pair , pion and delta contributions by less than 1% in our case whereas the difference in  @xcite is about 9% .",

    "that calculation used wavefunctions found from the av14 nn potential and the urbana three - body force .",
    "our wavefunction should therefore be only slightly different since the three - body force has only a small effect . to make the coupling coefficients the same we set @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",

    "the parameters @xmath150 and @xmath151 reflect the off - shell ambiguity in the pion exchange potential . for consistency with the av14 potential , which is a static potential , their values",
    "should be taken to be 1/2 .",
    "our exchange current apspv expresses the difference between what would be obtained using pseudoscalar and pseudovector @xmath152 coupling .",
    "pseudoscalar coupling corresponds to @xmath153 and pseudovector coupling to @xmath154 .",
    "it is not possible to achieve exact consistency of this current with the nn potential but the value @xmath155 is the most appropriate .",
    "we varied @xmath61 between 0 and 1 .",
    "the value of @xmath156 should be taken as 0.081 to be consistent with the av14 potential .",
    "however , the range 0.075 - 0.081 was used to estimate the uncertainty due to @xmath157 where the low value comes from a recent nijmegen analysis of nn scattering data @xcite .",

    "the values of @xmath170 and @xmath91 were then found by demanding consistency between the exchange current and the nn potential used to construct the wavefunction .",
    "the exchanges of @xmath171 yield isospin dependent spin - spin and tensor interactions ( @xmath172 and @xmath173 ) and it is these two components of the av14 nn force which were fitted . the long range parts of @xmath172 and @xmath173 are fitted exactly provided the same pion coupling @xmath157 and pion mass are used .",
    "the short range part is affected by the strong form factors and the desired effect of the form factors is that the strength of the potential at short distance is reduced .",
    "monopole form factors achieve this effect for @xmath173 but for @xmath172 an undesirable change in sign at small distance occurs .",
    "this can be traced back to the second derivative of the potential function arising from @xmath174 or @xmath165 exchange . to illustrate this consider the @xmath11 obep potential ( see appendix [ appobep ] for further details ) .",

    "examples of fit values for @xmath186 are given in table [ obepfit ] .",
    "we see that @xmath170 is smaller when @xmath207 is larger as one would expect .",
    "the value of @xmath91 is poorly constrained and apparently may vary between @xmath208 and @xmath170 .    to summarize , @xmath170 and @xmath91 were chosen to match the isospin dependent spin - spin and tensor potentials used to construct the wavefunction .",
    "they are functions of @xmath209 and @xmath210 and functionals of @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "this somewhat artificial procedure would be unnecessary if the wavefunctions were constructed using obep potentials found from the same lagrangian as the exchange currents were derived from . in that case @xmath90 and @xmath91 would be fixed by the deuteron properties and nn scattering data .",
    "an alternative improvement which could be made is to choose a different type of form factor , the idea being to match the shape of @xmath213 and @xmath214 very closely .",

    "we take the range @xmath225 reflecting the various models : there is a large uncertainty in the value of this parameter .",
    "our calculation does not treat the effect of the @xmath107-isobar explicitly i.e.  there are no @xmath107nn components in the wavefunction .",
    "we were therefore unable to take into account direct coupling to @xmath107-isobars present in the nuclei or the indirect effect of the @xmath107-isobars on the coupling of the nucleons .",
    "these processes have been considered for the axial current at zero momentum transfer by adam _",
    "the direct coupling contributes + 0.030 to the gamow - teller matrix element , m(gt ) , and the indirect effect 0.021 @xcite .",
    "these two effects compensate each other although their sum , + 0.009 , is not insignificant .",
    "a further deficiency of the calculation is the static approximation for the propagator of a @xmath107n pair .",
    "have shown that this approximation is not valid and leads to an overestimate of the @xmath107-excitation current by a factor of 1.9 for both m(gt ) and @xmath226 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) .",
