    "atom interacting with the intense laser field ( ilf ) can absorb more than one photon and then emits photons at harmonics of the laser frequency , which is well known as high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) @xcite .",
    "the harmonic spectrum has the following characteristics as a function of increasing frequency : a rapid decrease in harmonic intensity at first , followed by a plateau region with the harmonics having similar intensities ; and then a rapid drop in harmonic strength beyond the plateau region .",
    "recently , lots of theoretical works have studied this multiphoton phenomenon , including solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite , the semiclassical trajectory methods , such as the three - step model @xcite and the feynman s path - integral approach in the strong field approximation @xcite , and even the classical trajectory method @xcite .",
    "bohmian mechanics ( bm ) @xcite , or called quantum trajectory method @xcite , is another alternative formalism of quantum mechanics . in the early years",
    ", bm has been used to study some fundamental quantum phenomena such as the scattering by a square potential barrier @xcite and the diffraction through two slits @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been applied to study and analyze many different processes and phenomena in physics and chemistry , such as atom - surface scattering @xcite , electron transport in mesoscopic systems @xcite , photodissociation of nocl and no@xmath0 @xcite , and the chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "also , bm in terms of quantum trajectory has been considered to study chaos @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been successfully applied to the intense laser - atom physics to study the dynamics of the above - threshold ionization ( ati ) photoelectron by authors @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "bm is introduced to the intense laser - atom physics to study hhg , which allows us to follow the time evolution of individual electron trajectory in atomic system first .",
    "we then calculate the power spectrum with the electron trajectory and find the corresponding spectrum is irregular .",
    "next , we consider the power spectrum associated with an atom ensemble . in the atom ensemble , harmonic generation is determined by the maxwell equation , where the electronic polarization of the atom ensemble plays a key role for the harmonic generation .",
    "we will show the electronic polarization of the atom ensemble gained from bm is equivalent to that obtained from quantum mechanics . on this condition ,",
    "the power spectrum from bm is regular and consistent with that obtained from quantum mechanics .",
    "finally , we will briefly discuss the reason why an individual electron trajectory generates the irregular spectrum .",
    "this paper is organized as follow : we will briefly introduce quantum trajectory method first .",
    "then we show the hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom in ilf . in sec .",
    "iv , we calculate the harmonic spectrum from a single electron trajectory , following by harmonic generation associated with an ensemble of atoms interacting with the ilf in sec .",
    "v. finally , we briefly discuss the reason of the generation of the irregular spectrum with an individual electron trajectory and then conclude .",
    "quantum trajectory method comes from the following transformation of the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "firstly a wave function can be written in the polar form @xmath1 .",
    "secondly @xmath2 is substituted into the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "then the real part of the resulting equation is@xmath3 and the imaginary part has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "these two equations look like the classical hamilton - jacobi equation and the equation of continuity , respectively , except eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) has an extra term @xmath8 which is usually called quantum potential in bm .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) is called the quantum hamilton - jacobi equation governed by an external potential @xmath9 and the quantum potential @xmath8 .",
    "the motion of particle is guided by the bohm - newton equation of motion , @xmath10 , or , equivalently , by @xmath11 in practice , we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation to obtain @xmath2 , and then @xmath12 . in this way",
    ", the quantum trajectory of the particle can be gained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq ] ) .",
    "the schrdinger equation for hydrogen atom in ilf can be written as ( atomic units are used throughout ) @xmath13\\psi(\\mathbf{r},t).\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is the field - free hydrogen atom hamiltonian and @xmath15 is the intense laser - atom interaction : @xmath16 @xmath17 where the laser field is the linearly polarized field ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 is the laser field profile . due to the linearly polarized laser field ,",
    "magnetic quantum number @xmath20 of hydrogen atom is a good quantum number , so that the problem of solving the time - dependent schrdinger here can be simplified into a two - dimensional problem ( see the inset in fig .",
    "1 ) . in this work",
    "the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath2 is obtained by the grid method and the second - order split - operator method , which has been detailedly introduced by tong _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the laser field profile is @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the electric field amplitude and angular frequency , respectively .",
    "we choose @xmath25 a.u .",
    "( i.e. , @xmath26w/@xmath27 ) , and @xmath28 a.u .",
    "( i.e. , @xmath29 nm ) .",
    "the initial wave function @xmath30 of the system is in the ground state of the field - free hydrogen atom .",
    "after obtaining the wavefunction @xmath2 , we can follow the time evolution of electron trajectory @xmath31 by integrating eq . ( [ eq ] ) with the electron initial position @xmath32 . according to bm @xcite ,",
    "the initial electron distribution is @xmath33 . in this work",
    ", @xmath30 is the ground state of the field - free hydrogen atom .",
    "thus we can obtain an ensemble of electron trajectories with the corresponding electron initial positions .",
    "for an individual electron trajectory , the atomic dipole moment @xmath34 along the laser polarization direction is @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding power spectrum is gained by the fourier transformation of the dipole moment @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and the propagation time @xmath38 is @xmath39 in this work .",
    "explicitly , we take one atomic electron as an example with the initial position @xmath40 a.u . , @xmath41 in polar coordinates .",
    "the electron trajectory @xmath31 is calculated by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq ] ) . the corresponding power spectrum is shown in fig . 1 from eq . ( [ fd ] ) .",
    "the spectrum has even harmonics , which is dominated by a rayleigh scattering component at the laser frequency @xmath42 .",
    "we have obtained lots of electron trajectories with different initial position @xmath32 according to the initial electron distribution @xmath43 .",
    "the corresponding power spectra have the similar character described above . in the following ,",
    "however , we will show the even harmonics of the power spectrum are coherently removed in an ensemble of atoms and the corresponding power spectrum is consistent with that obtained from quantum mechanics .",
    "the harmonic generation of an atom ensemble can be gained with the maxwell equation @xcite:@xmath44 where @xmath45 is the electronic polarization of the atom ensemble at the point @xmath46 and @xmath47 describes the electromagnetic field ( involving the fundamental and the harmonic fields ) .",
    "obviously , the electronic polarization @xmath45 plays a key role for the harmonic generation from the ensemble of atoms .",
    "we will show that the electronic polarization @xmath45 gained from bm is , approximately , equivalent to that obtained from quantum mechanics , i.e. , both of their harmonic spectra from the atom ensemble are consistent .",
    "we first assume the number of atoms is @xmath48 in a small volume @xmath49 near the point @xmath46 in the atom ensemble ( @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the focal spot size of laser ) . the electronic polarization @xmath52 is defined as the atomic dipole moment per unit volume : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the atomic dipole moment of each atom in the small volume @xmath55 . from the view point of quantum mechanics ,",
    "the dipole moment of each atom is @xmath56 in the @xmath57 direction , where @xmath58 is the electron coordinate of atomic system and @xmath2 is the electron wavefunction .",
    "thus the electronic polarization of the atom ensemble obtained from quantum mechanics is @xmath59 in the @xmath57 direction .",
    "[ 2 ]     on the other hand , we calculate the electronic polarization of the atom ensemble from bm . according to bm @xcite , the probability that an electron lies between @xmath58 and @xmath60 in the atomic system at the time @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 , where the corresponding atomic dipole moment is @xmath58 ( in atomic units ) .",
    "then in the small volume @xmath55 of the atom ensemble , the number of atoms with atomic dipole moment @xmath58 is @xmath63 .",
    "the sum of all kinds of atomic dipole moments in the volume @xmath55 is @xmath64 .",
    "thus the electronic polarization @xmath45 at the point @xmath46 in the atom ensemble is @xmath65 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . for an atom ensemble",
    ", we can replace the sum by an integral , @xmath66 further , because the laser field is the linearly polarized field ( @xmath18 ) , the time - dependent wavefunction @xmath2 is symmetrical along @xmath57 axis .",
    "thus in the @xmath57 direction , @xmath67 where the last term equals eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) . in this way ,",
    "the electronic polarization @xmath45 gained from bm is , approximately , equivalent to that obtained from quantum mechanics , i.e. , both of their harmonic spectra from the atom ensemble are the same .",
    "figure 3 shows the harmonic spectrum from an ensemble of hydrogen atoms interacting with ilf ( laser confocal parameter @xmath68 mm , gas density @xmath69 atoms/@xmath70 described by a truncated lorentzian in the @xmath71 direction with @xmath72 mm @xcite ) , which has a clear plateau region and cutoff at the @xmath73th order .",
    "in bm , harmonic spectrum from a single electron trajectory has even harmonics ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , but they are removed in the spectrum associated with an ensemble of atoms ( see fig .",
    "the reason is that an individual electron trajectory does not possess an inversion center @xcite , but the electron trajectories of the atom ensemble have such centre . here",
    "we will numerically show that two electron trajectories are enough to get rid of the unphysical even harmonics if the initial positions @xmath32 of the two electrons are centrally symmetric .",
    "let s take two electrons as an example with the initial positions @xmath74 a.u . , @xmath41 and @xmath75 a.u . , @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding atomic dipole moment @xmath34 along the laser polarization direction is @xmath77 $ ] and the power spectrum gained from eq .",
    "( 4 ) is shown in fig .",
    "4 ( solid curve ) , which has only odd - order harmonics .",
    "in addition , we calculate the hhg power spectrum in the length form from the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( dotted curve in fig .",
    "4 ) @xcite .",
    "note that these two curves can basically overlap if the value of the power spectrum from bm is multiplied by a factor of 0.4 , i.e. , both of them have the same relative intensity .",
    "this is an interesting result , but the reason why hhg power spectra from bm and the time - dependent schrdinger equation have the same relative intensity should be studied in the future .",
    "in summary , we introduce bm into the intense laser - atom physics to discuss hhg .",
    "it allows us to follow the time evolution of each electron trajectory in an atomic system .",
    "we find that the power spectrum from an individual electron trajectory has the even unphysical harmonics .",
    "but the even harmonics are coherently removed in the ensemble of atoms and the power spectrum is consistent with that obtained from quantum mechanics .",
    "the reason of the appearance of the even harmonics is an individual electron trajectory does not possess an inversion center , but the electron trajectories of the atom ensemble have such centre .",
