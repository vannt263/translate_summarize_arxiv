    "the dglap evolution @xcite is the most familiar resummation technique , which describes scaling violations of parton densities",
    ". measurements of deep - inelastic scattering structure functions of the nucleon allow the determination of free parameters of the input parton distributions and the verification of so called sum rules .",
    "there exist different sum rules for unpolarised and polarised structure functions which refer to the moments of the structure functions . from a phenomenological point of view however , qcd tests based on moments @xmath13 is unreliable .",
    "the limit @xmath12 , which implies that the invariant energy @xmath14 of the inelastic lepton - hadron scattering becomes infinite ( @xmath15 ) will never be attained experimentally . in the theoretical approach to structure functions",
    "there are two ways to avoid the problem of dealing with the unphysical region @xmath12 .",
    "the first one is to work in @xmath0-space and obtain directly the evolution of parton distributions ( not of their moments ) .",
    "then one has integro - differential equations ( e.g. dglap one ) in @xmath0 and @xmath8 but the integration over @xmath0 goes for @xmath16 . in this case",
    "an extrapolation to the unmeasurable @xmath12 region is unneeded .",
    "the second way is using evolution equations for truncated moments of structure functions @xmath17 instead of for full moments . in the usually used method of solving qcd evolution equations",
    ", one takes the mellin ( full ) transform of these equations and obtains analytical solutions .",
    "then after the inverse mellin transform ( performed numerically ) one has suitable solutions of the original equations in @xmath0-space . in this way",
    "e.g. in a case of dglap approximation , the differentio - integral equations for parton distributions @xmath18 change after the mellin transform into simple differential and diagonalised ones in the moment space @xmath19 .",
    "the only problem is knowledge of the input parametrisation for the whole region @xmath20 what is necessary in the determination of the initial moments of the distribution functions . using truncated moments",
    "approach one can avoid uncertainties from the unmeasurable @xmath12 region and also obtain important theoretical results incorporating perturbative qcd effects at small @xmath0 , which could be verified experimentally .",
    "truncated moments of parton distributions in solving dglap equations have been presented in @xcite .",
    "authors have shown that the evolution equations for truncated moments though not diagonal can be solved with a quite good precision for @xmath3 .",
    "this is because each @xmath19-th truncated moment couples only with ( @xmath21)-th ( @xmath22 ) truncated moments . in @xcite",
    "the truncated moments method has been adopted to double logarithmic @xmath23 resummation .",
    "there is a number of papers in which the most known methods for solving the @xmath8 evolution equations for parton distributions have been reviewed ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "authors compare the dglap framework for the full mellin moments method with brute - force or laguerre - polynomial approaches , used for @xmath0-space version of the evolution equation . in this paper",
    "we compare the solutions of lo dglap @xmath8 evolution equations written for the truncated mellin moments of the structure functions with those , obtained by using the chebyshev - polynomial method in the @xmath0-space . in both these approaches",
    "we compute the truncated moments @xmath24 . as a test structure function",
    "@xmath25 we take two different spin - like nonsinglet parton distributions .",
    "we perform the computations for a wide range of the truncation point @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in the next section we briefly recall an idea of the evolution equation for truncated moments of parton distributions .",
    "the main topic of our paper i.e. the comparison of the chebyshev - polynomial and truncated moments techniques in solving the lo dglap evolution equation for the nonsinglet structure function is presented in section 3 .",
    "finally , section 4 contains conclusions .",
    "for ( full ) mellin moments of parton distributions @xmath27 @xmath28 the dglap evolution equation can be solved analytically .",
    "this is because one obtains in the moment space @xmath19 simple diagonalised differential equations .",
    "the only problem is the knowledge of the input parametrisation for the whole region @xmath29 , what is necessary in the determination of the initial moments @xmath30 : @xmath31 using the truncated moments approach one can avoid the uncertainties from the region @xmath12 , which will never be attained experimentally . the derivation of the dglap equations for truncated moments of parton distributions has been presented in @xcite .",
    "the evolution equations for truncated moments @xmath32 are not diagonal and therefore solving this problem is not so easy like in a case of the full - moments technique .",
    "nevertheless this method has an advantage over other approaches , based not only on the cut - off for unphysical region @xmath12 .",
    "the technique of truncated moments within dglap approximation enables namely to study scaling violations without making any assumption on the shape of the input parametrisation of parton distributions .",
    "while the solution of the evolution equations in the @xmath0-space requires knowledge of inputs @xmath33 with many parameters ( fitted in detailed comparison with the data ) , the initial values of truncated moments can be obtained directly by data . following the authors of @xcite ,",
    "we have found the lo dglap evolution equation for the truncated at @xmath4 mellin moment of the nonsinglet structure function @xmath34 in a form : @xmath35 @xmath36 is the truncated at @xmath4 moment of the nonsinglet structure function : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 the kernel @xmath41 is simply equal to the anomalous dimension @xmath42 : @xmath43",

    "is convergent and furthermore the value of ( @xmath51)-th moments decreases rapidly in comparison to the @xmath19-th moment . hence one can retain from ( [ r3.9 ] ) the closed system of @xmath53 equations : @xmath54 @xmath55\\ ] ] @xmath56 @xmath57\\ ] ] @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 denotes the lowest moment in calculations .",

    "we have made sure that the results ( [ r3.12])-([r3.13 ] ) agree with the solutions obtained with the help of the runge - kutta method . in the forthcoming chapter",

    "we solve the system of evolution equations for truncated moments ( [ r3.11 ] ) and compare the results with predictions , obtained in the chebyshev polynomial approach .",
    "the chebyshev polynomials technique @xcite was successfully used by j.kwieciski in many qcd treatments e.g. @xcite,@xcite . using this method",
    "one obtains the system of linear differential equations instead of the original integro - differential ones .",
    "the chebyshev expansion provides a robust method of discretising a continuous problem .",
    "this allows computing the parton distributions for `` not too singular '' input parametrisation in the whole @xmath68 region .",
    "more detailed description of the chebyshev polynomials method in the solving the qcd evolution equations is given in appendix a. in this paper we use two spin - like input parametrisations of the parton distribution @xmath69 at @xmath70 , namely : @xmath71 where constants @xmath72 and @xmath73 are determined by the appropriate sum rules .",
    "more singular at small-@xmath0 input ( [ r4.2 ] ) incorporates the latest knowledge about the low-@xmath0 behaviour of the polarised structure functions @xcite .",

    "this improvement of the accuracy breaks however for larger @xmath7 ( @xmath80 at @xmath81 and @xmath82 at @xmath83 ) because of increasing numerical errors .",
    "all presented above results concern the running coupling @xmath75 .",
    "we have found also , that for the constant @xmath64 the error function @xmath84 ( [ r4.3a ] ) grows approximately proportionally to the strength of @xmath64 : @xmath85 summarising , the lo dglap evolution of any truncated at @xmath10 moment of the parton distribution can be reproduced with the satisfactory accuracy , where the relative error @xmath86 .",
    "analysis of the qcd @xmath8 evolution equations for truncated moments of parton distributions is very interesting both from the theoretical and experimental point of view .",
    "the truncated moments technique is complementary to the existing methods for solving the evolution equations , based on the full moments or @xmath0-space approaches .",
    "apart from it refers directly to the physical values - moments ( rather than to the parton distributions ) , what enables to use a wide range of deep - inelastic scattering data in terms of smaller number of parameters . in this way ,",

    "the precision of the truncated moments approach is perfect for higher moments ( @xmath3 ) and not too large the truncation point @xmath4 ( @xmath10 ) , even for small @xmath6 .",
    "larger values of @xmath7 ( e.g. @xmath9 ) enables to obtain a quite satisfactory accuracy ( the relative error @xmath89 ) also for the first truncated moment .",
    "the original truncated moments technique @xcite has been developed in @xcite , what could improve the numerical efficiency .",
    "this technique can be a valuable tool e.g. in determination of the contribution to the moments of the gluon distribution from the experimentally accessible region .",
    "we think that the method of truncated moments can be useful in further theoretical and experimental qcd investigations .",
