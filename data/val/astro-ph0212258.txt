    "reviews on massive star evolution have shown there are a number of observations that suggest an additional parameter affects the evolution scenarios , ranging from blue - to - red supergiant ratios in clusters to cno abundances in main - sequence and evolved stars ; c.f . , maeder & meynet ( 2000 ) , heger & langer ( 2000 = hl00 ) , maeder & conti ( 1994 ) . in galactic supergiants ,",
    "the n / c ratios have long supported a parameter that varies from star - to - star , like rotation .",
    "this is because a variety of n / c ratios have been found within clusters of stars ( thus , not natal variations ) , and because the n / c ratios do not clearly scale with effective temperature , luminosity , or mass .",
    "evolution models that include effects of rotation emerged in 2000 . not only can rotation help to explain the abundance ratios and certain mass discrepancies , but the new models also predict that massive stars may produce and mix primary nitrogen into their atmospheres ( by meynet & maeder 2002 ) .",
    "the new models have been calibrated based on abundance ratios , masses , rotation rates , and ages in the published literature .",
    "but they also make definate predictions that can be tested for further refinement .",
    "unfortunately , one direct test that is difficult to implement is to examine abundance ratios versus rotation rate .",
    "rarely do we know the inclination angle of a rotating star .",
    "also , as @xmath0sin@xmath1 increases , then the spectral lines become so shallow and broad that the atmospheric analysis becomes quite difficult and less certain .",
    "fortunately , there are other indirect tests .",
    "one of the new predictions from stellar evolution calculations that include rotation is that the surface abundances of lithium , beryllium , and boron ( libeb ) will be rapidly depleted before significant mixing of any other material ( see heger & langer 2000 ) .",
    "these elements are fragile and easily destroyed when exposed to hot protons , thus any mixing in the atmosphere will rapidly dilute libeb and destroy those atoms that are mixed downwards",
    ". this should be detectable in main - sequence stars ; but boron is the only element with measurable absorption lines in b - type stars .",
    "boron has been measured in a handful of main - sequence b - stars ( see figure  1 ) from the biii 2066 and bii 1362 resonance lines . both require uv spectral observations , such as with hst - stis . there is a large range in the initial boron abundances in main - sequence b - stars , by a factor of 10 to 100 .",
    "this variation is not natal since several stars within a single association show this range , for example , the star in the orion association .    in figure  1",
    ", boron is observed to be depleted _ before _",
    "there is any detectable nitrogen enrichment .",
    "this matches predictions , as seen from the hl00 model for a 12 m@xmath2 star at 200 through h - core burning and three sets of initial abundances [ ( b , n ) = ( 2.6 , 7.6 ) , ( 2.8 , 7.7 ) , ( 2.8 , 7.8 ) ] .",
    "thick lines connect boron abundances for the same stars from different analyses .",
    "the boron abundance papers are listed in the legend ( see references ) , the nitrogen abundances are from cunha & lambert ( 1994 = cl94 ) , gies & lambert ( 1992 = gl92 ) , or vrancken ( 2000 ) .",
    "currently , the most extreme rotating models suggest that boron can be depleted by a factor of 10 before nitrogen is enriched ( e.g. , m = 25 m@xmath2 , v@xmath3 400 ) .",
    "the current data ( especially star hd36591 in ori ob1 ) suggest even larger depletions are possible before nitrogen enrichment .",
    "these boron depletions in main - sequence b - star , _ without significant nitrogen enhancements _ , are unique to rotating stellar evolution models .",
    "it is possibly to reproduce a boron - depletion _ with _ a nitrogen - enhancement through mass - transfer in a binary system ( wellstein , langer , & braun 2001 ) .",
    "another prediction of the rotating models is that there should be a wide range in the c and n abundances in evolved massive stars if these stars had a range in rotational velocities on the main - sequence .",
    "this has been seen and is well documented for galactic stars in the literature , e.g. , in o - stars ( herrero 1992 ) in b - supergiants ( mcerlean 1999 , lennon 1988 ) and in a - f supergiants ( venn 1995 ) .",
    "more recently , smartt ( 2002 ) found that sher 25 , an evolved early b - supergiant surrounded by nebular ejecta , has only a small nitrogen enrichment , incompatable with the predicted first dredge - up abundances .",
    "the fact that many of the n / c ratios in these stars ranged from solar ratios to only slightly enriched supports the idea that it is rotation that affects these abundances . another possibility has been that the n / c ratios are affected by surface mixing and the first dredge - up during a previous red giant phase ; in this case , we expect an offset in the mean n / c ratio ( of @xmath4 + 0.5  dex for stars @xmath510 m@xmath2 ) , which has not been seen in the literature until now ( below ) .    in most of the supergiants ,",
    "non - lte corrections have had to be applied to the c , and especially the n , abundances .",
    "the non - lte corrections result in n / c ratios in galactic supergiants that show no relationships with effective temperature , luminosity , or mass . and a variety of n / c ratios are often found for stars in the same ob association .",
    "thus , the variations in n / c are best attributed to star - to - star variations , such as rotation .    *",
    "new solar abundances : * before proceeding with a comparison of n / c ratios , it is important to notice that the solar abundances have been significantly improved through the 3-d convection models by m. asplund and collaborators . in this",
    "conference proceedings , new solar cno abundances are presented , showing excellent agreement between a variety of abundance indicators for each element . in the rest of this paper",

    "much of the sample for the n / c ratios in galactic supergiants comes from the a - f supergiants ( venn 1995 ) .",

    "this atomic data was sorely needed for the most reliable nitrogen abundance determinations since the collision excitation cross - sections were the most significant source of uncertainty in the lemke & venn ( 1996 ) nitrogen model calculations in a - stars .",
    "now , the new atomic data shows that the ni level populations are more collisionally coupled , which reduces the nlte _ corrections _ ( which increases the ni abundances ) .    in this conference proceedings , we present a new table of nitrogen abundances for the a - f supergiants ; see table  1 .",
    "these new results include the updates to the corrections calculated by np ( see przybilla 2002 for a detailed description ) , which makes a substantial difference to the hotter supergiants , yielding higher nitrogen abundances .",

    "the new nlte corrections do not significantly affect the cooler stars since their ni atomic levels are already more closely collisionally coupled .",

    "the n / c ratios scatter about the predicted first dredge - up abundances ( on the red giant branch ) for 9 to 20 m@xmath2 stars from the non - rotating evolution tracks of schaller ( 1992 ) .",

    "does this mean that there is primary nitrogen in the atmospheres of these metal - poor supergiants ( as predicted for metal - poor stars by meynet & maeder 2002 ) ?",
    "at present , we can only say that the metal - poor smc stars have more nitrogen in their atmospheres .",
    "its nucleosynthetic history is an open question .",
    "a comparison of the n abundances in galactic b - stars , galactic af - supergiants , and smc af - supergiants is shown in the histograms in figure  4 .",
    "clearly the new galactic af - supergiant results are offset from the initial ( solar and b - stars ) n value by @xmath40.5  dex .",
    "this was not seen in the previously published results ( dashed line , where the mean nitrogen abundance was close to the initial n abundance ) . in the smc ,",
    "the same broad distribution in nitrogen is seen as before , but now with more stars at higher values .    in maeder & meynet s review ( 2000 ) ,",
    "their figure  6 shows that a large spread in the n abundances in the a - f supergiants are expected through variations in the rotational velocities .",
    "this spread can be larger in higher mass stars or lower metallicity stars .",
    "we certainly see a larger spread in the smc stars versus the galactic stars , and we expect this is due to metallicity since the stars have similar mass ranges ( see figure  5 ) .",
    "\\(a ) all of the stars had very high rotation rates ( @xmath9300 ) on the main - sequence .",
    "this does not seem likely since the samples include alot of stars and the mean @xmath0sin@xmath1 values for these stars when on the main - sequence ( b2-type ) is only @xmath10200 ( e.g. , fukuda 1982 , dejager 1980 ) .",
    "\\(b ) the stars have higher masses than expected .",
    "this is possible , but unlikely .",
    "the stars appear to range in mass from 5 to 25 m@xmath2 based on a comparison with standard evolution tracks ( figure  5 ) , and even if those tracks are not appropriate ( e.g. , rotational mixing can affect the post - main sequence evolution ) there does not appear to be a relationship in the n or n / c ratios with mass .",
    "\\(d ) the stars have undergone the first dredge - up during a previous red giant phase .",
    "this certainly supports the n and n / c ratios observed , but since rotational mixing must also happen on the main - sequence ( to explain the boron dispersion in main - sequence b - stars ) , then the scatter in the n abundances and n / c ratios could be attributed to early rotational evolution effects in addition to first dredge - up abundances . in the smc ,",
    "additional mixing beyond the first dredge - up predictions is clearly indicated .",
    "[ of course , the few coolest stars with low n ( smc ) or n / c ratios ( galactic ) could not have undergone the first dredge - up yet and must be evolving directly from the main - sequence ] .    either of the last two options is likely given the current theoretical models .",
    "in addition , post - rgb evolution is indicated for blue supergiants ( from a he - burning sequence parallel to the main - sequence ) in metal - poor local group dwarf irregular galaxies from deep and accurate hst colour - magnitude diagrams ( e.g. , dohm - palmer 1997 ( sexa ) , 1998 ( gr8 ) ; tolstoy 1998 ( leoa ) ) .",
    "thus , excessive n enrichments in the smc af - supergiants are most simply explained as post - rgb first dredge - up abundances .",
    "but if we also consider the range in the nitrogen abundances , and the smc b - star nitrogen enrichments , then main - sequence rotational mixing , as well as rgb convective mixing , are both indicated in metal - poor stars .",
    "is the first dredge - up indicated at galactic metallicities ?",
    "the new af - supergiant nitrogen abundances do cluster around the first dredge - up predictions .",
    "but we also know now that rotational mixing is important in interpreting abundance ratios , in smc supergiants and in galactic main - sequence stars ( e.g. , boron ) .",
    "thus , the galactic af - supergiants may also have been rgb stars in their past , but it is also possible that their [ n / c ] ratios could be explained by excessive rotational mixing alone ."
