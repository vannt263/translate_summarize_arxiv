    "the fiber - optic distributed measuring systems were being actively developed during the past few years @xcite . particularly these systems can be used for acoustic field investigating , for monitoring of stresses in industry , in geophysical researches , etc .",
    "the reconstruction of information obtained by measuring system needs solving of tomographic problem .",
    "but frequently such solution is complex , needs large computer consumption and can not be performed in real time .",
    "therefore previously learned neural network can be utilized for solving of tomographic problem @xcite .",
    "an optical perceptron , which was implemented using a collection of amplitude holograms recorded on a disk - shaped holographic carrier and processing the output data from a fiber - optic measuring system , is reported in ref .",
    "another computer linear neural network was developed by authors of refs .",
    "we present the similar computer non - linear feed - forward neural network in this paper .",
    "consider two - dimensional fiber - optic distributed measuring system being set of measuring lines .",
    "the fiber - optic phase sensors form square @xmath0 lattice also having @xmath1 diagonal lines ( fig .",
    "[ square ] ) .",
    "the phase shift @xmath2 in this linear sensor is proportional to physical action value integrated over the line while the intensity of the transmitted light @xmath3 .",
    "the phase shift in fiber - optic line have to be along one cosine half - period .",
    "signal from such measuring system is simulated on input of neural network which is intended to reconstruct the value of physical action at intersection points .",
    "the @xmath4 fiber - optic distributed measuring system . ]    for solving of tomographic problem we choose perceptron with the non - linear hidden layer since this network has universal approximation capability @xcite .",
    "the neurons of the first layer serve as network inputs and feed data from the measuring system to the next layer .",
    "the second ( hidden ) layer proceeds following transformation : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are states of neuron inputs being signals from measuring sensors , @xmath7 are states of outputs and @xmath8 are synapses .",
    "we used @xmath9 as activation function @xmath10 .",
    "the hidden layer of neurons has @xmath11 inputs and @xmath0 outputs .",
    "the output layer of the neurons takes the linear transformation : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are states of third layer neuron outputs , @xmath14 are synapses of third layer .",
    "we selected gaussian distributions of the some physical quantity with one or two peaks as learning patterns .",
    "the following expression was used as objective function : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is superscript indicating number of learning pattern , @xmath17 are output states of the neural network for some learning pattern . for the training pattern @xmath6",
    "are formed as squared cosines of the sum of @xmath17 along the corresponding measuring line .",
    "we used error back - propagation for the network training , so we had to minimize @xmath18 with respect to @xmath8 , @xmath14 .",
    "we combined conjugate gradient and coordinate descent minimization methods for neural network learning .",
    "when conjugate gradient method failed we switched to the coordinate descent and after some iterations tried to start conjugate gradient minimization again .",
    "also we applied the `` thermal jumps '' technique .",
    "the minimization procedure finished after certain iteration count or on given accuracy reaching .",
    "on the first step we learned the neural networks to reconstruct the signal having , as well as training patterns , one gaussian peak .",
    "examples of initially unknown reconstructed distributions with different variances and @xmath19 are shown in tables [ example - delta ] , [ example - smooth ] .",
    "the neural networks was learned independently in all the cases with the similar randomly generated patterns .    on the next step we trained neural networks reconstructing distributions with two gaussian peaks .",
    "examples are shown in the tables [ example - delta2 ] , [ example - smooth2 ] . in the case of the smooth distribution",
    "the reconstructed signal is close to the original . for the @xmath20-like distributions the locations of the peaks",
    "are recovered correctly but their magnitude differs from the original .",
    "one can see from tables that neural network sufficiently accurately reconstructs unknown pattern and can be used in practice",
    ".    presented neural network unlike refs .",
    "@xcite can work not only with signal from fiber - optic measuring line being within the interval of linear dependence of light intensity on phase shift .",
    "the computer model of the neural network solving tomographic problem is proposed .",
    "this network can be used in conjunction with the distributed fiber - optic measuring system and partly may be made as electronic or optical hardware .",
