    "however , as is noted in ref.@xcite , the effect of compactification seems to be significant for the defect formation due to tachyon condensation . since the compactification radius should be small compared to the horizon size during inflation , any * cosmological * variation of a field in the compactified direction must be suppressed .",
    "if there is * no other mechanism * that induces variation of the field , the daughter brane must wrap the same compactified dimensions as the mother brane . as a result ,",
    "the codimensions of the daughter branes seem to lie within the uncompactified space .",
    "moreover , in ref.@xcite , it is pointed that the analysis does not fully account for the effect of compactification , since the directions transverse to the mother brane is not considered .",

    "is it really impossible to produce extended branes by the daughter brane production ?",
    "let us see more detail .",
    "if the initial perturbation of the tachyon condensation produces the seed for the @xmath14 branes on the world volume of the mother brane , it might wrap the same compactification space as the mother brane . the dotted line in the left picture in fig.[d2_in_hhk2 ]",
    "denotes the `` seed '' for the @xmath14 brane . to be more precise",
    ", a careful treatment of the effective action@xcite shows that the eigenfunction of the tachyonic mode is localized at the intersection .",
    "since the mechanism of this localization is * different * from the kibble mechanism , the `` seed '' for the @xmath14 brane can be localized at the intersection . from the string perspective",
    ", it seems obvious that the brane creation is due to the local dynamics of the open strings at the d4-d6-d4 intersection of the splitting d4 branes .",
    "as the recombination proceeds , the @xmath14 brane is pulled out from the mother @xmath5 brane , and finally becomes extended between split mother branes . in this case , the problem of the rr field is avoided since the length of the extended @xmath14 brane vanishes at the time when it is pulled out from the mother brane .",
    "of course , it costs energy to pull @xmath14 branes out from the @xmath5 branes , however in this case the cost is paid by the repulsive force between the splitting @xmath5 branes .",
    "our conclusion is consistent with the analysis of the effective action , where the production of the d - term strings is not suppressed .",
    "let us examine if the tension of the fully extended brane matches to the result obtained from the effective lagrangian .",
    "the brane splitting in the brane dynamics corresponds to the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath9 symmetry in the 4d effective lagrangian .",
    "we take the distance @xmath15 as in fig.[d2_in_hhk ] .",
    "then the tension of the string that corresponds to the extended d2-brane becomes@xcite @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the string coupling and the string length .",
    "we have defined that @xmath19 .",
    "following ref.@xcite , the gauge coupling constant in the effective four - dimensional lagrangian is given by the formula , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is given in fig.[d2_in_hhk ] .",
    "as a result , the tension of the string in the effective action , which corresponds to the d2-brane , is given by @xmath22 the above result matches to the tension of the d - term string , since the fayet - iliopoulos term in the effective lagrangian is given by@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is assumed .",
    "thus we can confirm that the tension of the d - term string matches to the extended d2-brane , @xmath25 .",
    "the defect formation in the brane world does not always correspond to the production of the lower - dimensional branes .",
    "for example , the position of a brane in the fifth dimension can be used to generate cosmic strings@xcite . later in ref.@xcite",
    ", it is shown that the relative position of the branes in the higher - dimensional bulk space can fluctuate to form such brane defects .",
    "explicit examples for domain walls , strings and monopoles are shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "these defects are formed by the deformations of the vacuum branes . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the branes are replaced by the domain walls that are embedded in the higher - dimensional spacetime , so that one can see what happens in the core .",
    "then it is shown that the branes are smeared in the core , so that the anticipated singularity is resolved .",
    "therefore , the field - theoretical construction is useful to understand the inner structure of these defects .",
    "however , if one considers the field - theoretical construction , it is quite difficult to include the quantum effect of the brane dynamics .",
    "therefore , it is important to formulate these types of brane defects in the hanany - witten type brane dynamics , so that we can investigate the quantum effect of the brane dynamics .",
    "we think it is easy to understand that these defects are produced during the usual cosmological evolutions of the universe .",
    "although it is not impossible to regard that the domain walls are the daughter branes being extended between mother branes , from the cosmological viewpoint these domain walls are formed by the spatial deformations of the vacuum branes during the usual cosmological evolution of the universe .",
    "first , we briefly describe our basic ideas for the incidental brane defects in the classical brane configuration . we consider parallel branes of codimension 2 , and assume that there is a weak repulsive force between them .",
    "we also assume that the potential for the distance between branes is stabilized at a distance .",

    "the brane q - ball is the configuration of the branes in motion , where the branes are rotating around each other .    in ref.@xcite , from the field - theoretical construction ( i.e. , the branes are constructed as the embedded defects in the higher - dimensional bulk ) , we have constructed several types of incidental brane defects .",
    "the brane q - ball was discussed in ref.@xcite , in which the simple brane anti - brane system was considered . as we have discussed above , the field - theoretical construction is convenient to see the structure in the defect core . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the field - theoretical construction is used to show how the expected singularity in the core is resolved by the smearing brane . on the other hand , in the field - theoretical construction",
    ", it is difficult to examine the quantum effect , which is induced by the brane dynamics .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate the quantum effect of the brane dynamics for the configurations of these brane defects . in this section , we try to construct the above - mentioned defects in the setups of the hanany - witten type , where the quantum effect of the brane dynamics is shown to play important roles for cosmological strings and domain walls .",
    "our arguments compensate the previous results in ref.@xcite .",
    "our classical setup of the hanany - witten model is depicted in fig.[mqcd_ns5-d4 ] .",
    "let us consider a global @xmath26 symmetry , which is depicted in fig.[axionstring ] .",
    "the @xmath26 symmetry is the classical symmetry of the effective four - dimensional action , but will be broken by the quantum effect .",
    "therefore , if a global string is constructed by the @xmath26 symmetry , it should turn out to be a junction ( or boundary ) of the domain walls .",
    "however , as far as one is considering the classical configurations of the field - theoretical construction , it is quite difficult to examine the quantum effect .",
    "another example is the domain wall that is induced by the permutation between branes .",
    "as far as we are considering only the classical brane configurations , the permutation between branes seems to generate another degenerated vacuum@xcite . in this section , however , we show that such permutations become trivial if the quantum effect of the brane dynamics is properly included .",
    "then we discuss about brane q - balls . in the usual four - dimensional theory",
    ", one can construct q - balls if    * there is a flat potential that is lifted by a small perturbation .",
    "* there is an effective @xmath26 global symmetry .",
    "our model satisfies the above criteria .",
    "the brane q - balls are conceptually different from the conventional q - balls@xcite .",
    "we show how one can distinguish the conventional q - balls from the brane q - balls .",
    "we show that cosmological domain walls , axionic strings and q - balls can be produced by the usual brane dynamics after brane inflation .",
    "we stress here that it is quite natural to expect cosmological formation of these defects in the conventional scenarios of the evolution of the universe .",
    "the analysis of the four - dimensional effective action is discussed in appendix a. we pay attention to the discussions in this section so that they become parallel to the analysis in appendix a.    here we consider brane configurations of the @xmath27 dimensional @xmath4 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) , and the brane counterpart of the cosmological defects .",
    "the starting point of our discussion is the brane configuration of type iia string theory consisting of solitonic ( ns ) five - branes and @xmath28 d4-branes .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we consider the object ; @xmath29 which is schematically sketched in fig.[mqcd_ns5-d4 ] . here",
    "the gauge coupling of the @xmath27 dimensional gauge theory is given by ; @xmath30 if supersymmetry is not broken , there are no forces between d4-branes , and the field that parameterizes the brane distance represents the flat direction of the effective four - dimensional lagrangian . however , in more realistic situations , supersymmetry must be broken . here",
    "we consider a simple assumption that a tiny breaking of supersymmetry induces weak repulsive force between the d4-branes . in this case",
    ", the thermal effect can stabilize the potential between branes , which induce the restoration of the corresponding symmetry in the four - dimensional effective action@xcite .",
    "after symmetry breaking , d4-branes are placed on a circle , as is depicted in fig.[basic - brane ] .",
    "the elements ( @xmath31 s ) in the effective theory correspond to the position @xmath32 of the endpoints of the d4-branes on ns5 .",
    "let us first consider a naive permutation between the two d4-branes .",
    "we stress here that it is important to understand why the naive permutations in the classical configuration(see fig.[permutation_wall ] ) * do not * induce any physical domain walls .",
    "it should be noted that it is rather hard to understand the reason from the classical configuration . as we have discussed for the effective action ,",
    "the quantum effect is described by the deformation of the moduli space .",
    "the vacuum of the mqcd coulomb branch@xcite is represented by the curve , which takes the same form as eq.([curve - sym ] ) . from the viewpoint of the brane dynamics , the curve represents a m5-brane . in this case",
    ", one can see that the above - mentioned permutation in the classical configuration becomes a trivial symmetry of the quantum configuration , which works on the two parts of the identical m5-brane .",
    "this result is a triumph of mqcd , as it can not be obtained from the classical argument of the brane dynamics .",
    "moreover , as is already discussed in ref.@xcite , defects are the important probes for the examination of the consistency between sqcd and mqcd . in our case , since the results obtained from the quantum brane dynamics are consistent with sqcd for the axionic strings and the domain walls , one can understand that our results present alternative proofs for the consistency between sqcd and mqcd in a rather exotic situation .",
    "although the permutations do not induce any physical domain wall , the axionic string and @xmath33 domain walls are still the physical objects of the quantum brane dynamics .",
    "sqcd , these defects are unstable in the supersymmetric limit .",
    "on the other hand , the usual bps domain walls can not appear in the classical configuration .",
    "] we have included a small soft mass that destabilizes the coulomb branch , which is so small that it does not ruin the equations for the curve .",
    "the classical @xmath34 symmetry is broken by curving the left and the right fivebranes to @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the radius of the compactified @xmath38 . because of the fact that @xmath39 lives on a circle of radius @xmath37 , there is the residual discrete symmetry @xmath33 .",
    "the domain walls are produced by the spontaneous breaking of @xmath33 .",
    "similar to the usual cases , our axionic strings are formed at the scale where the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath34 symmetry is induced by @xmath40",
    ". then a dynamical potential is generated at lower energy scale , which breaks @xmath34 to the discrete symmetry . at this time",
    ", the axionic string becomes a junction ( or boundary ) of the @xmath33 domain walls .",
    "here we should note how one can circumvent the criteria given in ref.@xcite , in which the formation of cosmological domain walls is discussed to be negligible . in our case , although it is not impossible to think that the domain walls are the daughter branes being extended between vacuum branes , cosmological consideration suggests that they are formed by the continuous deformations of the vacuum branes , therefore they are not produced by tachyon condensation .",
    "the actual construction of the @xmath33 domain walls is straightforward .",
    "since the supersymmetry breaking is weak in this case , thermal effect can stabilize the potential between branes . at the beginning when the temperature is higher than the dynamical scale ,",
    "the branes are placed on top of each other .",
    "the corresponding gauge symmetry is restored in the effective action .",
    "then the branes start to fall apart at low temperature , with spatial fluctuations of their positions as is anticipated by the conventional kibble mechanism .",
    "the domain walls are described by the fivebranes that interpolate between the two adjacent vacua .",
    "let us consider a domain wall , which looks like one vacuum of the theory for @xmath41 and looks like another vacuum for @xmath42 .",
    "here we denote these two vacua by the index `` a '' and `` b '' , and @xmath43 is one of the three spatial coordinates .",
    "then the domain wall is described by the fivebrane that has two adjacent vacua on its boundaries , morphing one to the other along the z direction .",
    "if the vacuum states were described by the fivebranes of the form @xmath44 , where @xmath45 was a riemann surface embedded in the extra dimensions @xmath46 , the domain walls are described by the fivebranes of the form @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the four - dimensional spacetime without @xmath43 , and @xmath49 is a three - surface in the seven manifold @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the copy of the spatial @xmath43 direction . near @xmath41 , @xmath49 should look like @xmath52 . on the other side , near @xmath42",
    ", @xmath49 should look as @xmath53 .",
    "the defect is described by the continuous deformation of the existing m - theory fivebrane , morphing from one side to the other along the @xmath43 direction .",
    "the cosmological formation of such defects is already discussed in ref.@xcite , by using the field - theoretical construction .",
    "* as we have stated above , in addition to the conventional brane defects that are formed by brane creation , one should consider another kind of brane defects that are formed by the continuous deformations of the branes if one wants to consider generic cases of cosmological scenarios .",
    "since the two kinds of brane defects can be produced by the same process , one must deal with the mixture of these defects in the actual analysis of the brane universe .",
    "*    finally , we consider the brane q - balls in the hanany - witten type brane dynamics .",
    "conventional q - balls in the four - dimensional theories are already discussed by many authors@xcite .",

    "however , as is discussed in @xcite , there is a * crucial difference between q - balls in the effective action and brane q - balls*. in the case of brane anti - brane pair , the decay mode of the brane q - ball is dominated by the radiation into the bulk when the charge of the brane q - ball exceeds a critical value . in the followings ,",

    "the existence of the critical charge is crucial in the analysis of realistic cosmological models .",

    ", the gravitino mass is given by @xmath71 , where @xmath72 denotes the scale of the supersymmetry breaking .",
    "although the charge of the q - ball becomes quite large in conventional cosmological scenarios , the distance between rotating branes , which is denoted by the scalar field @xmath70 , do not exceed the compactified radius . in this case , the suppression factor of @xmath73 in eq.([braneq - sugra ] ) is crucial .",
