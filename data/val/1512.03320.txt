    "in this study , we present numerical calculations that suggest that , by exploiting key differences in mechanical properties between cancerous and normal cells , _ oncolysis _ , or bursting of cancerous cells , can be induced selectively by means of carefully tuned ultrasound harmonic excitation while simultaneously leaving normal cells intact .",
    "we refer to this procedure as _",
    "oncotripsy_. specifically , by studying the vibrational response of cancerous and healthy cells , we find that , by carefully choosing the frequency of the harmonic excitation , lysis of the nucleolus membrane of cancerous cells can be induced selectively and at no risk to the healthy cells .",
    "numerous studies suggest that aberrations in both cellular morphology and material properties of different cell constituents are indications of various forms of cancerous tissues .",
    "for instance , a criterion for malignancy is the size difference between normal nuclei , with an average diameter of @xmath0 to @xmath1 microns , and malignant nuclei , which can reach a diameter of over @xmath2 microns @xcite .",
    "early studies @xcite have shown that the nuclear - nucleolar volume ratios in normal tissues and benign as well as malignant tumors do not differ quantitatively .",
    "nucleoli volumes of normal tissues , however , are found to be significantly smaller than the volume of nucleoli in cancerous tissues @xcite .",
    "similarly , the mechanical stiffness of various cell components has been found to vary significantly in healthy and diseased tissues . in @xcite ,",
    "the stiffness of live metastatic cancer cells was investigated using atomic force microscopy , showing that cancer cells are more than @xmath3 softer than healthy cells .",
    "other cancer types , including lung , breast and pancreas cancer , display similar stiffness characteristics . furthermore , using a magnetic tweezer , @xcite found that cancer cells with the lowest invasion and migratory potential are five times stiffer than cancer cells with the highest potential .",
    "likewise , increasing stiffness of the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) was reported to promote hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) cell proliferation , thus being a strong predictor for hcc development @xcite . moreover",
    ", enhanced cell contractility due to increased matrix stiffness results in an enhanced transformation of mammary epithelial cells as shown in @xcite .",
    "conversely , a decrease in tissue stiffness has been found to impede malignant growth in a murine model of breast cancer @xcite .",
    "various experimental techniques have been utilized in order to quantitatively assess the material properties of individual cell constituents in both healthy and diseased tissues .",
    "the inhomogeneity in stiffness of the living cell nucleus in normal human osteoblasts has been investigated by @xcite using a non - invasive sensing system . as shown in that study ,",
    "the stiffness of the nucleolus is relatively higher compared to that of other nuclear domains @xcite .",
    "similarly , a difference in mass density between nucleolus and nucleoplasm in the xenopus oocyte nucleus was determined by @xcite by recourse to refractive indices .",
    "the elastic modulus of both isolated chromosomes and entire nuclei in epithelial cells are given by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "specifically , @xcite showed that mitotic chromosomes behave linear elastically up to 200% extension .",
    "experiments of @xcite additionally measured the network elastic modulus of the nuclear envelope , independently of the nucleoplasm , by means of micropipette aspiration , suggesting that the nuclear envelope is much stiffer and stronger than the plasma membranes of cells .",
    "in addition , wrinkling phenomena near the entrance of the micropipette were indicative of the solid - like behavior of the envelope .",
    "@xcite estimated the elastic moduli of both cytoplasm and nucleus of hepatocellular carcinoma cells based on force - displacement curves obtained from atomic force microscopy .",
    "in addition , @xcite used micropipette aspiration techniques in order to further elucidate the viscoelastic behavior of human hepatocytes and hepatocellular carcinoma cells . based on their study , @xcite concluded that a change in the viscoelastic properties of cancer cells could affect metastasis and tumor cell invasion .",
    "the increased compliance of cancerous and pre - cancerous cells was also investigated by @xcite , who used atomic force microscopy to determine the mechanical stiffness of normal , metaplastic and dysplastic cells , showing a decrease in young s modulus from normal to cancerous cells .",
    "the scope of the present work , and the structure of the present paper , are as follows .",
    "we begin by defining the geometric model and summarizing the material model and material parameters used in finite - element analyses .",
    "subsequently , the accuracy of the finite - element model is assessed by means of a comparison between numerical and analytical solutions for the eigenmodes of a spherical free - standing cell .",
    "we then present eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of a free - standing ellipsoidal cell , followed by a bloch wave analysis to model tissue consisting of a periodic arrangement of cells embedded in an extracellular matrix . finally , resonant growth rates are calculated that reveal that cancerous cells can selectively be targeted by ultrasound harmonic excitation .",
    "the transient response at resonance of healthy and cancerous cells is presented in the fully nonlinear range by way of verification and extension of the findings of the harmonic modal analysis .",
    "we close with a discussion of results .",
    "in this section , we investigate the dynamical response of healthy and cancerous cells under harmonic excitation .",
    "we begin by briefly outlining the underlying geometric and material parameters used in our analysis , followed by a verification of the finite element model used for modal analysis .",
    "we then calculate the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of both free - standing and periodic distributions of cells . in this latter case , we determine the full dispersion relation by means of a standard bloch wave analysis . finally , we present resonant growth rates and simulate the transient response of both cancerous and healthy cells excited at resonance in a fully - nonlinear setting by means of implicit dynamics calculations .",
    "the nucleus , the largest cellular organelle , occupies about @xmath4 of the total cell volume in mammalian cells @xcite .",
    "it contains the nucleolus , which is embedded in the nucleoplasm , a viscous solid similar in composition to the cytosol surrounding the nucleus @xcite . in this study ,",
    "the cytosol is modeled in combination with other organelles contained within the plasma membrane , such as mitochondria and plastids , which together form the cytoplasm . for simplicity , we idealize the plasma mebrane , nuclear envelope , cytoplasm , nucleoplasm , and nucleolus as being of spheroidal shape .",
    "we model the plasma membrane , a lipid bilayer composed of two regular layers of lipid molecules , in combination with the actin cytoskeleton providing mechanical strength as a membrane with a thickness of @xmath5 nm @xcite .",
    "similarly , we model the nuclear envelope , a double lipid bilayer membrane , in combination with the nuclear lamin meshwork lending it structural support as a @xmath6 nm thick membrane .",
    "we define the cytoplasm , nucleoplasm , and nucleolus as spheres with radii of @xmath7 m , @xmath8 m , and @xmath9 m and subsequently scale them by a factor of @xmath10 in two dimensions in order to obtain the desired spheroidal shape .",
    "we assume an average nuclear diameter of about @xmath11 m , as reported in @xcite .",
    "diameters for both cytoplasm and nucleolus follow from @xcite and @xcite , who report nucleus - to - cell and nucleus - to - nucleolus volume ratios of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the geometry with all cell constituents as used in subsequent finite element analyses is illustrated in figure  [ fig : geometry ] . in order to further elucidate the effect of an increasing nucleus - to - cell volume ratio , as observed experimentally @xcite",
    ", we consider a range of geometries with increasing nuclear and nucleolar volumes .",
    "for all of these geometries , we hold fixed the volume of the cytoplasm .",
    "we assume a constant nuclear - to - nucleolar volume ratio for both healthy and cancerous cells , as observed by @xcite .        cell - to - cell differences and experimental uncertainties notwithstanding , the preponderance of the observational evidence suggests that the cytoplasm , nucleus and nucleolus are ordered in the sense of increasing stiffness . neglecting viscous effects",
    ", we model the elasticity of the different cell constituents by means of the mooney - rivlin - type strain energy density of the form @xmath14 , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 denotes the deformation gradient , @xmath16 is the jacobian of the deformation , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are material parameters . for both cytoplasm and nucleus in cancerous cells , material parameters corresponding to the data reported by @xcite",
    "are chosen and summarized in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "we additionally infer the elastic moduli of the nucleolus from @xcite based on a comparison of the relative stiffnesses of the nucleoli and other nuclear domains . for membrane elements of the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope ,",
    "we choose material parameters corresponding to the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we infer matrix parameters from the shear moduli reported by @xcite for normal and fibrotic livers . for all parameters ,",
    "we resort to small - strain elastic moduli conversions , with a poisson s ratio of @xmath20 to simulate a nearly incompressible material , in order to match experimental values with constitutive parameters .",
    "we vary the stiffness of both cellular components and extra - cellular matrix ( ecm ) within a pathophysiologically - relevant range in order to investigate the effect of cell softening and ecm stiffening on eigenfrequencies . finally , we assume both cytoplasm and nucleoplasm to have a mass density of @xmath21g/@xmath22 , a value reported by @xcite as an average cell density , and we set the density of the nucleolus to @xmath23g/@xmath22 @xcite .",
    ".set of constitutive parameters ( bulk modulus @xmath19 and shear moduli @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) used in the eigenfrequency analyses . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the spectral gap , or gap in the lowest eigenfrequencies , between healthy and cancerous cells and tissues provides a first hint of sharp differences in the response of healthy and cancerous tissue to harmonic excitation .",
    "in particular , the preceding analysis shows that the fundamental frequencies of the cancerous tissue may be in close proximity to eigenfrequencies of the healty tissue , which appears to undermine the objective of selective excitation of the cancerous tissue .",
    "however , a complete picture requires consideration of the relative energy absorption characteristics and growth rates of resonant modes . to this end , we consider the modal decomposition of the displacement field @xmath24 where @xmath25 are eigenvectors obeying the orthogonality and normalization condition ( [ e45dls ] ) and @xmath26 are time - dependent modal amplitudes obeying the modal equations of motion @xmath27 in this equation , @xmath28 is the corresponding eigenfrequency , @xmath29 is the external force vector and @xmath30 is the corresponding modal force . for a harmonic excitation of frequency @xmath31 , eq .  ( [ kc3v7h ] )",
    "further specializes to @xmath32 where now @xmath33 is a constant modal force amplitude . at resonance , @xmath34",
    ", the amplitude of the transient solution starting from quiescent conditions grows linearly in time and the transient solution follows as @xmath35 we thus conclude that the growth rate of resonant modes is @xmath36    figure  [ fig : fn ] shows the growth properties of @xmath37 for two different cases . in the first case , a cancerous cell is excited at its resonant frequency of @xmath38rad / s , whereas the healthy cell is excited at its closest resonance frequency of @xmath39rad / s . in the second case ,",
    "eigenfrequencies of @xmath40rad / s and @xmath41rad / s are investigated .",
    "the simulations reveal that the growth rate of the resonant response of the cancerous cells is much faster than that of the healthy cells , which opens a window for selectively targeting the former .",
    "the preceding analysis has been carried out with a view to understanding the resonant response of cells and tissues under harmonic excitation in the harmonic range . in this section",
    ", we seek to confirm and extend the conclusions of the harmonic analysis by carrying out fully nonlinear implicit dynamics simulations of the transient response of healthy and cancerous cells under resonant harmonic excitation . in this analysis , a geometry of ratio @xmath42 is considered , figure  [ fig : mesh ] , together with material parameters of table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "we restrict attention to the long wavelength limit , i.  e. to ultrasound radiation of wavelengths larger than the cell size . in keeping with this limit",
    ", we enforce harmonic displacement boundary conditions directly as shown in figure  [ fig : geometry ] in order to mechanically excite the cell .",
    "the strength of the harmonic excitation used in the calculations is @xmath43@xmath44 m .    in the simulations , we track the transient amplification of the cell response up to failure .",
    "we assume that failure occurs when the stress in the cytoskeletal polymer network , which constitutes the structural support for cell membranes , reaches a threshold strength value .",
    "@xcite found that the macroscopic network strength can be traced to the microscopic interaction potential of cross - linking molecules and other cytoskeletal components such as actin filaments . here",
    ", we assume a rupture strength of the order of @xmath45pa based on strength values of a single actin / cross - linking protein bond reported in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : transient ] shows the fully - nonlinear transient response of healthy and cancerous cells at the resonant frequency of the latter .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that stresses in both the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope of the cancerous cell grow at a much faster rate than in healthy cells . for the harmonic excitation under consideration , the strength of the nuclear envelope of the cancerous cell reaches the rupture strength at time @xmath46s , while , at the same time , the level of stress in the healthy cells is much lower .",
    "figure  [ fig : kineticpotential ] furthermore illustrates the kinetic and potential energy of the nuclear envelope during excitation at resonance of both healthy and cancerous cells .    from transient response simulations , the energy that needs to be supplied until the point of rupture is reached is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the applied traction on the boundary @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the displacement vector , @xmath51 is the force acting on surface node @xmath52 at time @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the corresponding displacement vector .",
    "for a cell geometry with a ratio of @xmath55 and a cancerous potential of @xmath56 , calculations give a value of @xmath57pj for the energy per cell required for lysis .",
    "assuming an average cell size of 20 @xmath58 m , a time to lysis of 70 @xmath58s and a tumor of 1 cm in size , this energy requirement translates into a power density requirement in the range of 0.8 w/@xmath59 .     and a cancerous potential of @xmath56 .",
    "shown is the frobenius norm of first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "in this study , we have presented numerical calculations that suggest that spectral gaps between hepatocellular carcinoma and healthy cells can be exploited to selectively bring the cancerous cells to lysis through the application of carefully tuned ultrasound harmonic excitation , while keeping healthy cells intact .",
    "we refer to this procedure as _ oncotripsy_. a normal mode analysis in the harmonic range reveals the existence of a healthy - to - cancerous spectral gap in ground frequency of the order of @xmath60 rad / s , or @xmath61 khz .",
    "further analysis of the growth rates of the transient response of the cells to harmonic excitation reveals that lysis of cancerous cells can be achieved without damage to healthy cells .",
    "these findings point to oncotripsy as a novel opportunity for cancer treatment via the application of carefully tuned ultrasound pulses in the frequency range of 80 khz , duration in the range of 70 @xmath58s and power density in the range of 0.8 w/@xmath59 .",
    "this type of ultrasound actuation can be readily delivered , e.  g. , by means of commercial low - frequency and low - intensity ultrasonic transducers .",
    "evidently , the present numerical calculations serve only as preliminary evidence of the viability of oncotripsy , and further extensive laboratory studies would be required in order to confirm and refine the present findings and definitively establish the viability of the procedure ."
