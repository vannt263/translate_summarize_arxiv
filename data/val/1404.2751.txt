    "the construction of a new terminal at the schenzen airport , southeast china , has been used to question the current strategies of infrastructure growth in developing countries  @xcite .",
    "schenzen is a large city , but its airport is directly connected by an eight kilometer ferry to the hong kong airport , which can handle twice as many passengers .",
    "is it reasonable to invest more than one billion dollars increasing the capacity of such a large infrastructure with another one nearby ?",
    "opponents to this investment classify it as a white elephant and as one example of the misbegotten infrastructure growth in developing countries .",
    "the ones in favor , argue that not only the costs of investing in schenzen are lower than in hong kong but also global connectivity can profit from cooperation between stakeholders of air - transportation systems in the region . here",
    "we address , from a network science perspective , how such proximity and cooperation between local actors is key to the robustness of spatial networks .",
    "the simplified representation of complex systems as a network of nodes and links has provided important insights into the design of a variety of systems , such as power grids  @xcite , maritime commerce  @xcite , and communication networks such as the internet  @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "nodes are spatially embedded according to the spatial coordinates of the elements  @xcite .",
    "this simplification allows us to focus on the topological aspects of the system and to easily extend our results to many applications .",
    "we characterize the robustness of a network as its capacity to maintain global connectivity under a sequence of node removals and describe a strategy based on local cooperation to improve robustness under possibly realistic constraints .",
    "we discover a continuum transition when changing the distance for which nodes are allowed to swap links , a cooperation range .",
    "we calculate the critical exponents of this transition and show that the key factor controlling the value of the critical exponents is the exponent of the algebraic decay of the connection probability with the node distance .    as an ubiquitous infrastructure system ,",
    "we explain our method in the context of the worldwide air - transportation network ( wan ) , though our results impact the whole class of spatially embedded networks .",
    "it is paramount that the wan works in an extremely reliable and efficient fashion , as any temporary airspace closure , such as the one caused by the eruption of the volcano eyjafjallajkull in 2010 , may cause huge losses worldwide  @xcite .",
    "complex networks have been used to study airflight networks .",
    "simple abstractions of flights and airports have been used to characterize its robustness   @xcite , study its structural properties  @xcite and evolution  @xcite . here",
    "instead we go one step further and propose modifications to the robustness of the wan and identify new properties associated with it .",
    "we summarize data provided by openflights in the year 2011 as a single static network with @xmath0 airports ( nodes , modeled as points distributed across the surface of a sphere with distance calculated according to the haversine formula ) and around eighteen thousand links  @xcite .",
    "links are undirectional , assuming that each flight should return to its origin , and weighted according to the number of possible flights between two airports .",
    "airports are weighted by the total number of passengers transported that year .",
    "information regarding the number of passengers transported between airports is not available .    as a self - organized system , in which preferential attachment is expected to play a pivotal role ,",
    "the wan is quite fragile to targeted attacks , i.e. , intentional removal of the most connected nodes causing the collapse of the giant connected component  @xcite .",
    "the aim of our optimization strategy is to create a robust yet economically feasible wan .",
    "since robustness can be defined in different ways , we consider that a robust wan should be capable of transporting passengers even in face of a targeted attack , in contrast with previous works where only the size of the largest connected component is considered  @xcite .",
    "we simulate a sequence of airport closures ( node removal ) and quantify robustness @xmath1 as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the total number of nodes , @xmath4 is the number of nodes removed from the network , and @xmath5 is the number of passengers in the largest component after a fraction @xmath6 of nodes were removed , i.e. , the sum of nodes weight on the largest component .",
    "closures are executed from the most to the least connected node .",
    "the location of airports are mostly determined by economical forces , such as to cater to local demands . in many cases ,",
    "airports are located within a short distance from each other , sometimes only a few kilometers away as , e.g. , airports in the schenzen - hong kong area , or a few hundred kilometers but still easily reachable , such as the airports in the northeast of the united states .",
    "we assume that a flight rerouted to an airport within a cooperation range @xmath7 of the original destination has a similar attractiveness .",
    "if need be , a passenger landing at a different airport could easily take another means of transportation , such as the local train network or a shuttle bus , to go to the desired destination . for transportation networks ,",
    "the cooperation range is defined as the geographical distance between nodes , but other spatial networks might require other metrics , such as travel time or cost .",
    "we increase network robustness through link swaps , with the probability to swap a route inversely proportional to the weight of a link @xmath8 between airports @xmath9 and @xmath10 , so that important connections are affected with less priority .",
    "this tends to keep the transportation capacity of the system stable , and the introduction of complicated interventions on airports , such as building new runaways , might be avoided .",
    "moreover , a connection is only rerouted to an airport within the cooperation range of the original destination .",
    "as an example , flights could be distributed between hong kong and schenzen or among the airports surrounding london .    given a cooperation range @xmath7 and a metric @xmath11 , which calculates the distance between nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 ,",
    "the following swap strategy is performed :    1 .   select a node @xmath9 randomly having at least one neighbor ; 2 .   select a neighbor @xmath10 of node @xmath9 with probability inversely",
    "proportional to the weight of @xmath8 ; 3 .   select a pair of connected nodes @xmath12 and @xmath13 so that @xmath14 and @xmath15 with probability inversely proportional to the weight of @xmath16 ; 4 .   remove links @xmath8 and @xmath16 and create links @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this strategy is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig::diagram ] .",
    "swaps change the network robustness @xmath1 but we only perform swaps that increase @xmath1 . from this point on ,",
    "we call such a swap , a _",
    "geo swap_. a fixed number of geo swaps of the order of the number of links is executed .",
    "to compare networks of different sizes and populations , we normalize the robustness as @xmath19 , in which @xmath20 is the value of @xmath1 for @xmath21 km , the minimum value for which a geo swap will be considered in the wan , and the maximum robustness @xmath22 obtained for @xmath23 km , which is approximately half of the planet perimeter .",
    "this strategy builds on top of previous work which focused on different acceptance mechanisms  @xcite or topological characteristics  @xcite , but differs significantly by focusing on geographic limitations and low - weight links .",
    ", a node @xmath12 at distance @xmath24 is selected ( panel a )",
    ". if nodes @xmath10 , neighbor of @xmath9 , and @xmath13 , neighbor of @xmath12 , also have @xmath25 then links @xmath8 and @xmath16 , in blue , are swapped ( panel b ) . ]",
    "the cooperation range @xmath7 limits the area of possible swaps to guarantee that a geographically acceptable change is performed .",
    "a too small value of @xmath7 does not provide sufficient room for robustness improvement . while a too large value of @xmath7 leads to reroutes of connections to impractically far away airports . by tuning the values of @xmath7",
    ", we observe a critical value of the cooperation range @xmath26 km at which a significant improvement in the wan is first registered .",
    "this range in fact yields the highest variance of robustness increase among all possibilities , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::rwan ] .",
    "km , in which the standard deviation reachs the maximum . ]    by considering continental airflight networks - constructed from the division of the wan into continents ( details in * s1 *  table ) - together with other spatially embedded networks ( the european power grid and the european rail network ) , we observe that @xmath27 is positively correlated with @xmath28 ( spearman s correlation coefficient @xmath29 ) , where @xmath30 is the total area in which the @xmath3 nodes are embedded ( fig .",
    "[ fig::vcrit_x_density ] ) .",
    "being the combination of local and intercontinental flights , the wan lies slightly off the trend , but in general we can conclude that the typical radius served by an airport is correlated to the minimum distance at which swaps become effective . artificially generated random networks also confirm this relationship ( * s1 * figure ) .",

    "this allows us to calculate the exponents in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig::scaling_cont ] as @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the data suggest that the construction of airports and the creation of connections follow a similar mechanism in all continents , though the limited system size of each continent and obvious geographic differences prevent strong conclusions .",
    "however , data for australia significantly differs from the others .",
    "because a great number of islands in oceania have many small airports , sometimes being the only feasible connection between remote areas , we assume that airports and flights in this continent were established following a different mechanism .",
    "most probably , the predominance of several small islands might pose a physical limit to the cooperation range which is related to the average distance between islands .",
    "after successive applications of the geo swap .",
    "curves in the main panel represent each continent . a total of @xmath43 tentative geo swaps are executed for several cooperation range values .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is selected as the highest variance point over @xmath44 samples .",
    "data is scaled using @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the inset shows size dependence of @xmath32 at @xmath38 , scaling as @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , where @xmath3 is the total number of nodes .",
    "symbols are larger than the standard deviation . ]",
    "spatial networks are mainly defined by three properties : nodes position , degree distribution , and connection pattern .",
    "a simplified model - where nodes are assigned random positions , the degree distribution is a poisson distribution , and connections are randomly assigned without any spatial / degree bias - displays different critical exponents ( * s3 *  figure ) .",
    "however , if the probability @xmath49 that nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 are connected decays algebraically with the distance between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the decay exponent , we obtain exponents that are numerically consistent with the ones in fig .",

    "[ fig::gravity ] based on networks generated as follows .",
    "node positions are uniformly distributed across an earth spherical cap of area @xmath30 and in order to keep @xmath52 , the same value of the wan , network size is calculated accordingly .",
    "node degree follows a poisson distribution of average degree @xmath53 .",
    "node weights are chosen according to the equation @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the degree of node @xmath9 , which is a fit of the relationship between node weights and degree of the wan .",
    "link weights are randomly distributed from @xmath56 $ ] , in which @xmath57 is the maximum link weight on the wan .",
    "we observe that changes in the value of @xmath58 affect consistently the slope in the data - collapse ( fig .",

    "further analysis also show that when @xmath62 the ratio between the average length of routes and the average distance between two airports is similar to that found for the continents ( * s2 *  figure ) .",
    "interestingly , the empirical probability distribution of link lengths in the wan is a power law of exponent @xmath63 ( * s5 *  figure ) .",
    "this suggests that correlations as the ones developed in the distance - decay model are consistent with the ones found for the wan and characteristic for the universality class .",

    "in order to provide applicable insights , any network modification strategy should take into account realistic constraints naturally imposed by the problem .",
    "the geo swap contains a simple set of rules specifically designed to improve the robustness of spatial networks .",
    "it is important to note however that a probabilistic approach is more a guidance than a closed optimization recipe .",
    "we expect that future procedures built on top of our strategy should be carefully tailored to the underlying system .    in an infrastructure perspective ,",
    "the geo swap , which makes flights land in different airports , has two crucial implications .",
    "firstly , a second transportation system should be used to connect nearby airports , in line with recent works dealing with the coupling of infrastructure networks  @xcite . by taking into account the critical cooperation range these couplings",
    "could be designed or improved for distances close to @xmath27 .",
    "secondly , a local level of cooperation is necessary between airports .",
    "flights in schenzen and hong kong could be rerouted to attend different yet nearby airports worldwide , further increasing the reliability of the local service and the overall wan robustness .",
    "one could also organically extended our analysis to incorporate airlines into the scenario .",
    "the already existing alliances within the airline industry do cooperate on a regular basis .",
    "this direction could be pursued by future works if data about alliances among airlines is available .",
    "our rewiring strategy is also able to show that the continents , with one exception , follow the same universality class regarding robustness improvements , as the probability that two airports are connected decays quadratically with their distance .",
    "being a continent with its own geographical idiosyncrasies , australia does not fit our analysis , for which further studies are necessary . in summary ,",
    "our results show that , for any spatial network , the universality class of the robustness improvement strongly depends on the spatial correlation of connected nodes .",
