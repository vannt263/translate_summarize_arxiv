    "the investigation of magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and in the intracluster medium ( icm ) is a new challenge for modern cosmology .",

    "* ) , only a handful of pioneering observations suggest that magnetic fields of significant intensity may be present in the igm and no accurate measurements are available for those regions of the universe with densities of order of the mean cosmic density or lower .",
    "cluster magnetic fields detected through faraday rotation measurements are of the order of a few @xmath2 g .",
    "@xcite measured field strengths of about 2 @xmath2 g on scales of 10 kpc in a statistical sample of point sources observed through the coma cluster , and clarke , kronberg and bhringer ( 2001 ) derived field strengths of 4 to 8 @xmath2 g in a sample of point sources observed in 16 low redshift clusters . @xcite",
    "have done a similar analysis of southern galaxy clusters and provided an independent confirmation of the statistical signal reported by @xcite .",
    "magnetic field strengths of 10 to 40 @xmath2 g have been reported for the cool cores of the hydra a and cygnus a clusters on scales of 35 kpc ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite apply a maximum likelihood estimator for magnetic power spectra , based on the theory of turbulent faraday screens @xcite , to a high quality faraday rotation map of the north lobe of the radio source hydra a produced by the novel pacerman algorithm @xcite .",
    "they find a cluster central magnetic field strength of @xmath3 g .",
    "there have been few attempts to detect intergalactic magnetic fields beyond clusters .",
    "@xcite detected radio - synchrotron radiation from an extended magnetic field in the region of the coma supercluster , with a field strength of 0.1 to 0.01 @xmath2 g .",
    "this radio emission comes from a region with an enhanced number density of galaxies , which might indicate a group of galaxies in the process of merging with coma .",
    "@xcite report possible radio  synchrotron evidence of intergalactic magnetic fields in the region zwcl 2341.1 + 0000 at @xmath4 , where galaxies seem to be aligned along a filament .",
    "however , in both cases it remains controversial whether these measurements prove the magnetisation of the diffuse igm or instead the state of the gas belonging to the supercluster environment .",
    "theoretically , three basic mechanisms could explain the presence of magnetic fields in the icm and igm ( for a review * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : i ) they could have a primordial origin , ii ) they were seeded in the igm by battery effects of shock waves or inhomogeneous radiation fields , or iii ) their existence is linked to the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "a primordial origin implies that weak seed fields of about @xmath5 10@xmath6 g were produced during the early phases of the cosmic evolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these seed fields must have later been amplified by extremely efficient mechanisms , if the fields we are to observe today were of the order of a fraction of a @xmath2 g .",
    "alternatively , seed magnetic fields may have been produced in protogalaxies and galaxies and subsequently ejected into the icm and igm . in both cases ,",
    "cosmic shear and/or dynamo effects may intervene to amplify the seed fields .",
    "cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters have been performed by @xcite , assuming a homogeneous seed field of 10@xmath7 g at @xmath8 .",
    "they find that seed fields of this intensity can be efficiently amplified to reproduce the magnetic field strength observed in local clusters .",
    "however , inhomogeneous seed fields can similarly lead to the right amount of cluster magnetisation : @xcite follow the evolution of the magnetic fields produced by biermann ",
    "battery effects in shock waves from the cosmic structure formation process and find that they can be further amplified by cosmic shear flows , leading to strong cluster fields .",
    "two different mechanisms can explain the transport of the magnetic seed fields produced in galaxies into the icm and the diffuse igm .",
    "the magnetic energy may be easily ejected into the igm and icm by jets and radio lobes emerging from powerful radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated the injection of magnetic fields by radio galaxies , and @xcite followed the subsequent amplification through dynamo effects , finding that it can account quite accurately for the observed magnetic field strengths and cosmic ray densities in the icm .",
    "@xcite make a step further and estimate the magnetic flux transported directly into the igm .",
    "the second mechanism is related to the ejection of magnetised interstellar gas and supernova ejecta by galactic winds .",
    "@xcite consider such a scenario of magnetised outflows from star forming galaxies and find that a substantial fraction of the intergalactic medium could have been seeded at relatively high redshift .",
    "however , their estimate was based on a power  law extrapolation of the cosmic star formation rate to high redshifts , which is not consistent with the known peak of star formation activity at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "@xcite follows the amplification of a variety of magnetic seed fields by turbulent dynamo , driven by the motion of galaxies in the icm , and concludes that this mechanism can not account for the magnetic fields observed in clusters .",
    "galactic winds emerging from star forming galaxies have been detected throughout the history of the universe ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and are often advocated to explain the metal enrichment of the igm ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , bsw05 hereafter ) .",
    "although it is still controversial if winds from large galaxies can fully account for the observed level of metal enrichment of the igm at @xmath10 @xcite , it is clear that they do play a role in galaxy formation and there is no doubt whether they eject a consistent fraction of the metal and gas content of galaxies at any redshift .",
    "magnetic fields are clearly observed in the interstellar medium of galaxies @xcite , where they are believed to play an essential role during star formation . in a few cases , magnetic fields",
    "are also observed in the galactic material outflowing from star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate a magnetic field strength of 10 @xmath11 g in the material outflowing from m82 , while @xcite find a field strength of about 7 @xmath11 g in the outflow of ngc 4666 .",
    "@xcite argue that galactic winds are able not only to advect galactic magnetic fields but also to amplify them by shear flows from kelvin  helmholtz instability .",
    "if a significant fraction of the outflows are magnetised , it is reasonable to expect that they may at least partially contribute to the magnetisation of the icm and igm .",
    "the transport of the magnetic flux by galactic outflows may occur at virtually any redshift : at higher redshifts the main contribution may come from protogalaxies with total masses of the order of @xmath12 m@xmath13 , while at lower redshifts galaxies with stellar masses comparable to the ones of local dwarf galaxies or larger may become the dominant source of magnetic fields .    in this paper , we use high resolution simulations of galaxy formation , which include semi  analytic prescriptions for the physics of galactic winds , to investigate the efficiency of outflows to seed the icm and igm with magnetic fields and cosmic rays .",
    "numerical models of galactic winds do partially explain the transport of the metals produced in galaxies into the igm and , since there is an analogy between the transport of metals and the transport of magnetic fields , we investigate the possibility that galactic winds can eject seed magnetic fields from galaxies and transport them into the igm and icm .",
    "however , we do not intend to investigate in detail all the physical phenomena connected to the transport of the magnetic fields in our simulations , because semi ",
    "analytic models are intrinsically not suitable to treat the magneto ",
    "hydrodynamics involved in full detail .",
    "we present two different scenarios for the ejection and transport of magnetic fields by galactic winds : a `` conservative '' scenario and an `` optimistic '' scenario . for each case , we then analyse the effect of the efficiency of winds to affect the results . in the first scenario",
    ", we aim to provide a `` conservative '' estimate of the global magnetisation of the universe and we only consider the ejection and the transport of magnetic `` seed '' fields by winds , while amplification mechanisms are neglected . as a consequence ,",
    "these results should be treated as lower limits . in the second scenario ,",
    "we include a simple prescription for the amplification of the seed magnetic fields during the wind evolution and we predict a level for the magnetisation of the universe that represents an extreme case and that can be therefore regarded as an upper limit .    given the resolution of our simulations , we focus on the evolution of winds emerging from galaxies with @xmath14 m@xmath13 at @xmath15 .",
    "we are interested in determining the fraction in volume of the icm and igm which can be magnetised by winds and we calculate the minimum magnetic energy and the minimum cosmic ray energy density which can be ejected into the icm and igm by winds .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sim ]",
    "we describe our set of simulations and how we implement our recipes for the transport and amplification of the seed magnetic fields on top of the prescriptions for the evolution of galactic winds . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our results for the transport of magnetic fields by winds and we discuss the possible amplification of the seed fields by cosmic shear and turbulence .",
    "we briefly discuss the ejection , transport and amplification of cosmic rays in section [ cr ] and finally we draw our conclusions in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this work , we use the simulations of galactic winds presented in bsw05 and we implement new semi ",
    "analytic recipes for the transport of the magnetic fields on top of the pre  existing scheme .",
    "we assume a @xmath16cdm cosmology with matter density @xmath17 , dark energy density @xmath18 , hubble constant @xmath19 , primordial spectral index @xmath20 and normalisation @xmath21 .    in subsection [ sim1 ]",
    "we briefly describe the set of high resolution n  body simulations and the semi  analytic model for galaxy formation .",
    "we present our prescriptions for the physics of galactic winds in subsection [ sim2 ] and for the evolution of magnetic fields and cosmic rays in subsections [ sim3 ] and [ sim4 ] , respectively .",
    "a set of high resolution n  body simulations , `` m3 '' @xcite , is used to follow the evolution of the dark matter and the formation of structures with time .",
    "the `` field '' simulation m3 describes an approximately spherical region of space with diameter 52 @xmath22 mpc and average density close to the cosmic mean .",
    "the fact that only about half the enclosed galaxies at @xmath1 are field galaxies , while the rest are in groups and poor clusters , makes it particularly suitable to investigate the effects of feedback on the diffuse igm .",
    "the m3 simulation efficiently combines a high resolution in mass with a large simulated volume , necessary to study the effects of feedback from galaxies with stellar masses as low as dwarfs in their proper cosmological context .",
    "the number of particles in the simulated region is about @xmath23 and the particle mass is @xmath24 m@xmath13 .",
    "the simulations were performed by @xcite using the parallel treecode gadget i @xcite .",
    "the dark matter evolution was followed from redshift @xmath25 down to redshift @xmath1 and 52 simulation outputs were stored between @xmath26 and @xmath1 .",
    "the formation and evolution of galaxies is modelled with the semi  analytic technique proposed by @xcite in the new implementation by @xcite .",
    "merging trees extracted from the simulations are used to follow the galaxy population in time , while simple prescriptions for gas cooling , star formation and galaxy merging model the processes involving the baryonic component of the galaxies . at @xmath27 a total of about four hundred thousand galaxies are identified and about three hundred and fifty thousand are present at @xmath1 .",
    "the two largest clusters have a total mass of about @xmath28 m@xmath13 .",
    "bsw05 implement new prescriptions for the long  term evolution of winds in the semi  analytic code of @xcite .",
    "their model aims to provide simple predictions about the effects of winds on the diffuse igm and , in particular , on its metal enrichment history . here , we give a brief qualitative description of the model , but we refer the interested reader to bsw05 for a more detailed discussion .",
    "the dynamics of galactic winds is modelled as a two  phase process : a pressure  driven , adiabatic phase , followed by a momentum  driven phase .",
    "we treat these two phases separately , according to the different physical processes that drive the expansion of winds . during the first phase ,",
    "an over  pressurised bubble of hot gas emerges from a star forming galaxy and evolves adiabatically until its cooling time becomes shorter than its dynamical expansion time .",
    " taylor phase of the evolution terminates when the loss of energy by radiation becomes substantial and the material at the outer edge of the bubble starts to cool down . during the second phase of the wind evolution , a thin shell of cooled material accumulates at the shock front and the dynamics of the wind becomes dominated by the momentum imparted by the outflowing material onto the thin shell .",
    "this second phase is the classic momentum  driven snowplough and both the shell and the outflowing wind material are cool . for simplicity ,",
    "we make the assumption of spherical symmetry .    according to @xcite , during the sedov  taylor phase of adiabatic expansion the dynamics of the outflow is described by the equation for the conservation of energy of a spherical bubble with energy injection at the origin : @xmath29 \\left ( v_{\\textrm{s } } - v_{\\textrm{o } } \\right ) - v_{\\textrm{o } } p_{\\textrm{o } } \\right\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where@xmath30 is the wind energy , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the radius and the velocity of the shock , @xmath33 and @xmath34 the mass outflow rate and the outflow velocity of the wind , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 the density , the pressure , the outward velocity and the internal energy of the surrounding medium , respectively .",
    "@xmath39 is the total mass internal to the shock radius .",
    "the entrainment fraction @xmath40 is a parameter that defines the fraction of mass that the bubble sweeps up while crossing the ambient medium .",
    "this equation states that the bubbles are powered by the material outflowing from the galaxies and that they are slowed down by gravity and by the ram pressure and the thermal pressure of the ambient medium .",
    "the equation of motion for a spherically symmetric thin shell is given by the conservation of momentum @xcite : @xmath41 with @xmath42 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 the mass , the radius and the velocity of the shell and @xmath43 the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo .",
    "the first term on the right  hand side represents the momentum injected by the starburst , the second term takes into account the gravitational attraction of the dark matter halo and the two final terms represent the thermal and the ram pressure of the surrounding medium .",
    "the conservation of mass law for a pressure driven bubble is @xmath44 while for a thin shell @xmath45    initial conditions for the mass loss rate and the velocity of winds are taken from @xcite and calibrated to match the observations of winds both in local starbursts and in high redshift galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . @xmath46 and @xmath34 are calculated as a function of the star formation rate of the galaxy blowing the wind : @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a constant that takes into account various properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) like , e.g. , the efficiency of conduction relative to the thermal conductivity of clouds , the minimum radius of clouds in the ism and the dimension of star  forming regions ( see @xcite for a comprehensive discussion ) . with this assumption ,",
    "the momentum input @xmath50 is only weakly dependent on @xmath49 ( @xmath51 ) , with a stronger dependence on the star formation rate ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the energy input is proportional to the star formation rate , but does not depend on @xmath49 and therefore on all other galaxy properties .",
    "both @xmath49 and @xmath40 define the mass loading of winds , but while @xmath49 determines the amount of gas entrained from the ism of the galaxy , @xmath40 is the fraction of gas swept up by winds from the ambient medium after blow out .",
    "the remaining fraction of mass @xmath53 is assumed to be in dense clouds which are unperturbed by the wind .",
    "a low value @xmath54 may reflect either a clumpy ambient medium or a heavily fragmented wind , while @xmath55 describes a near  homogeneous medium , which can be entirely swept up by the wind .",
    "for this work we assume @xmath56 and we consider two values of the entrainment fraction parameter , that is @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the first value represents the behaviour of winds with inefficient mass loading , which can easily escape from galaxies at any redshift , while the second represents highly mass loaded winds , whose efficiency to expand far into the igm is significantly reduced with respect to less mass loaded winds .",
    "bsw05 find that the results for winds only weakly depend on @xmath49 , while the strongest dependence in the model is on the entrainment fraction parameter @xmath40 . currently , there are no observational constraints on the parameter @xmath40 and our simulations are unable to constrain it on the basis of our results .",
    "@xcite try to constrain the parameter by comparing the statistical properties of synthetic ly@xmath59 spectra with observed ones , but are unable to put any constraint on either of the two models : both scenarios are equally likely and none is in contrast with observations .",
    "the volume filling factor of galactic winds is similarly not accurately constrained by observations : published estimates vary between 0.004% and 40% and in principle neither of the models we present in this work can be excluded on the basis of observations .    when winds expand inside the haloes of galaxy groups , they sweep up the hot and possibly metal enriched intragroup medium and they are subject to the cluster gravitational attraction , thermal and ram pressure forces",
    ". winds expanding into the igm entrain metal ",
    "free gas , which is assumed to have constant density and pressure and whose velocity field is determined by the hubble flow . in principle , winds have to be far more energetic to escape from large dark matter haloes than to escape from field galaxies or small groups , since the forces they have to overcome are stronger .",
    "in general , winds have a higher probability to escape the haloes of isolated galaxies than to escape from groups , and it is unlikely that they can escape from large clusters , although we can not prove this in our simulations because of the lack of massive dark matter haloes .",
    "ram pressure plays an important role to quench outflows and its influence is particularly strong in large haloes , where it can prevent winds from blowing @xcite . thermal pressure in low ",
    "redshift haloes can also slow down winds considerably , but is normally negligible with respect to the other forces at high redshifts .",
    "the aim of our calculations is to describe the injection of seed magnetic fields into the igm by galactic winds . with our current means , this can only be done in an approximative way .",
    "one of the main simplifications we use in the following is the assumption that the magnetic fields in winds are dynamically negligible .",
    "this does not imply that organised magnetic fields at the base of the wind could not play a role in launching the outflows .",
    "however , we assume that the conversion of magnetic forces into kinetic energy happens before the fields enter the expanding wind bubble .",
    "the remaining magnetisation evolves passively within the outflow , allowing a simplified description of its evolution , as we briefly describe below .",
    "a more detailed derivation of our equations is given in appendix  [ dermagen ] .",
    "we define the injection of the magnetic fields ejected by galaxies into the igm as the _ magnetic field seeding _ , since this expression literally describes the process well .",
    "potentially , shear flows in the igm can subsequently amplify these seed fields to the observed levels .",
    "we note that the term _ magnetic field seeding _ is often used in the literature to describe the battery  effects , which generate magnetic fields without requiring a pre  existing seed magnetization , due to corrections to the ideal magneto  hydrodynamic equations .",
    "this initial generation of magnetic fields is believed to take place in stars , in galaxies and during the early phases of the evolution of the universe . in this work , we do not attempt to model the process , but we assume that it has happened in the past , allowing galaxies to create their own magnetic field and to amplify it to the observed level . this existing magnetic field",
    "is then ejected by the galaxy and advected in to the igm by a galactic  scale outflow .    in our conservative scenario ,",
    "we treat the seed magnetic fields analogously to the metals and we do not process them any further : this implies that we describe the injection of the seed fields by galaxies into the outflows and their dilution due to the expansion of winds , but that we do not take into account any possible mechanism that could produce amplification . with this assumption",
    ", we can make predictions for the injection and transport of seed magnetic fields into the igm and icm , which effectively result in a lower limit of the actual magnetisation of the universe .",
    "we present our prescriptions for the amplification of the seed fields in subsection [ optimistic ] , where we describe the build  up of our optimistic scenario .",
    "we discuss other possible mechanisms that could further amplify the seed fields transported by winds in subsection [ amplb ] and we make a few consideration about the transport of cosmic rays in winds in section [ cr ] .",
    "since in this work we want to make order of magnitude predictions , we neglect the possible influence of the magnetic fields on the evolution of the galactic winds and we set up the new semi  analytic prescriptions for the magnetic fields on top of the pre  existing scheme of bsw05 .",
    "however , this approximation turns out to be well justified : in fact , in our calculations we find that the magnetic energy is always several orders of magnitude smaller than the total energy in the winds .",
    "to simulate the transport of magnetic fields by galactic winds , we need two main ingredients : an equation for the evolution of the magnetic fields and suitable initial conditions . to be consistent with the evolution of winds set by equations ( [ energy ] ) and ( [ monster ] ) , we derived an equation for the evolution of the magnetic energy in winds : @xmath60 @xmath61 is the total magnetic energy in a bubble",
    ", @xmath62 is the rate of magnetic energy injected by winds , @xmath63 is the wind volume and @xmath64 is the variation in the wind volume due to the expansion .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of equation ( [ benergy ] ) expresses the decrease in the magnetic energy due to the adiabatic expansion of the bubbles and is a negative contribution .",
    "this can be deduced from the induction equation for a frozen  in magnetic field expanding isotropically , when the shear amplification term is neglected .",
    "a detailed derivation , which discusses the underlying assumptions , can be found in appendix [ dermagen ] .",
    "here we give a simplified argument .",
    "the induction equation yields @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this implies that @xmath67 where the numerical factor @xmath68 reflects the assumption of no special alignment between the local field direction and the local direction of the expansion of the wind .",
    "we assume that the magnetic energy injection rate is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the volume of the injected material , @xmath71 is the density of the gas injected into the wind , @xmath72 is the magnetic energy density of the wind material outflowing from the galaxy , and the mass outflow rate @xmath33 is given by equation ( [ cond1 ] ) .",
    "equation [ bin ] assumes that the magnetic field injected at the base of the wind has the strength of a typical galactic magnetic field . since the production of a galactic  scale magnetic field by , for example , an @xmath73 dynamo mechanism is not instantaneous , we assume that in our simulations magnetic energy can be injected in winds only after the host galaxy has completed a full rotation . the rotational period of the galaxy is calculated as a function of the disk radius and circular velocity , that is @xmath74",
    ".    in our model , winds make a transition between the pressure driven phase and the momentum driven phase when their cooling time becomes shorter than their dynamical timescale .",
    "however , when simulating the evolution of the magnetic fields in the wind , we continue to use equation ( [ benergy ] ) for the conservation of the magnetic flux throughout the wind evolution .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation , because the magnetic energy can be injected into the winds independently of the dynamical phase of the wind and equation ( [ benergy ] ) does not critically depend on any quantity linked to a particular phase of the wind .    a crucial quantity in eq .",
    "( [ bin ] ) is the density @xmath71 of the gas outflowing from a galaxy at a rate @xmath33 .",
    "a estimate of this quantity can be derived as a function of the mass loss rate @xmath33 of a wind through the entire surface area @xmath75 of a galaxy at the velocity @xmath34 : @xmath76 where we assume that the galactic radius is a fixed fraction of the virial radius , that is @xmath77 , as in bsw05 .",
    "the magnetic energy density @xmath72 associated with the mass injected in winds can be expressed as @xmath78 with @xmath79 the galactic magnetic field and @xmath80 the density of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the galaxy . here",
    "we assume that the magnetic field lines expand adiabatically and isotropically when the ism is blown out of the disk of a galaxy and is injected into a wind .",
    "the factor in parantheses in eq .",
    "( [ eb ] ) represents therefore the dilution of the magnetic fields when the density of the ejected gas drops below the density of the ism .",
    "the adiabtic index @xmath81 derives from the relationship @xmath82 in the induction equation , which implies @xmath83 and @xmath84 for isotropic expansion .",
    "the density of the ism is given by @xmath85 with @xmath86 the mass of the ism .",
    "galaxies in the local universe have magnetic fields of order 5 @xmath2 g ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , while interacting galaxies can have magnetic fields as high as 30 @xmath2 g ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in our simulations",
    ", we will express @xmath87 where @xmath88 g is a conservative reference magnetic field value at the base of the winds and @xmath89 is a `` fudge '' factor to rescale our results to less conservative choices of an initial magnetic field .      in this subsection",
    "we describe our simple and purposefully optimistic prescription for the amplification of magnetic fields during the wind evolution . to set up this prescription ,",
    "we consider only the amplification caused by two mechanisms directly linked to the wind evolution , namely the injection of the shocked interstellar gas into the wind and the expansion of the wind into the surroundings of the source galaxy .",
    "the first mechanism we consider is the amplification of the magnetic fields at the base of the winds , where the outflowing material escapes the visible regions of galaxies . here",
    ", the magnetic fields embedded in the ejected gas can be amplified through kelvin  helmholtz instabilities .",
    "this complex process is described in detail by @xcite and we do not intend to discuss it further .",
    "what is relevant for this work is the fact that @xcite , when simulating the process , find that the magnetic energy density increases by a factor of 3 , almost independently of their set of initial conditions . we take this into account in our simulations by scaling the magnetic field we inject in winds by the fudge factor @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ bfactor ] ) .",
    "in addition , we do know that observations of magnetic fields in local galaxies yield strengths of about @xmath91 g ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "for our optimistic scenario , we therefore set the magnetic field strength associated to the galactic ism to be @xmath92 g . if we incorporate this value of a more realistic galactic magnetic field in the fudge factor , together with the amplification factor of @xmath93 at the base of the wind by kelvin ",
    "helmholtz instability , we obtain a total fudge factor @xmath94 , which we include in our simulations .",
    "the second mechanism we consider for the amplification of magnetic fields is the effect of shear flows inside wind cavities and bubbles during the wind expansion into the ambient medium . to estimate how strongly the magnetic fields could be amplified , we first need to determine the characteristic timescale of this mechanism .",
    "since motions inside winds can take place on scales of the order of the wind radius @xmath31 , an effective timescale @xmath95 can be estimated as @xmath96 where @xmath32 is the proper wind expansion velocity , @xmath97 is the hubble flow at distance @xmath31 from the source galaxy and @xmath98 is the hubble constant as a function of time .",
    "the term @xmath99 represents the peculiar velocity of a wind with respect to the hubble flow and is the only shear motion whose contribution to the amplification of the magnetic field in wind we consider .",
    "@xmath100 is a field amplification efficiency factor which depends on the poorly known flow geometry inside the wind .",
    "this amplification by shear motions directly counteracts the dilution of the magnetic fields due to the adiabatic expansion term and can be incorporated in eq .",

[ above ] simplifies to @xmath105    in this extremely optimistic case in which @xmath102 , the dilution of the magnetic fields by adiabatic expansion and the amplification by shear motions cancel out , leaving behind only the term @xmath106 .",
    "this factor is small with respect to the magnetic energy injection term @xmath107 and it therefore represents only a small correction in eq .",
    "in this section we show our results for the magnetisation of the igm and icm . in subsection [ bwinds ]",
    "we discuss the simulated properties of the magnetic fields in winds for the conservative and the optimistic scenarios . in subsection [ vff ]",
    "we present our results for the fraction of magnetised igm as a function of cosmic time and we qualitatively describe the effect of galaxy clustering on the distribution of the magnetic fields in our simulated region .",

    ".    clusters of galaxies are expected to be only weakly rotating , if at all , and other field amplification mechanisms than the @xmath154 dynamo have to be found to explain the observed magnetic fields . @xcite and @xcite suggested that magnetic fields could be amplified by the small scale turbulence produced by the motion of galaxies through the icm .",

    "such an amplification factor would be sufficient to bring even the seed magnetisation of a ng we find in our conservative models to the observed @xmath2 g level of magnetisation in galaxy clusters .",
    "galactic winds emerging from galaxies in clusters can contribute to the magnetisation of the icm in clusters even when they do not escape the gravitational attraction of the halo .",

    "this gas is then quickly stripped away from the galaxy by the ram pressure of the hot cluster gas ( @xcite , @xcite ) and mixed into the icm . the stripped material would therefore contribute to chemically enrich , shock heat and magnetise the icm of the cluster , although it would be unable to power a wind and reach the igm .",
    "unfortunately , we are currently unable to reproduce this effect in our numerical model .",
    "outside clusters and bound structures , magnetic fields in winds can be amplified by turbulence , if present , by the cosmic shear and by the compression of the outflowing gas into a thin shell , when winds become momentum  driven and evolve like a snowplough . in this last case , the density of the cooled material accumulating onto the shells , which is a mixture of supernova ejecta , shocked interstellar medium and gas accreted from the ambient medium , can become much higher than the density of the ambient medium .",

    "the relativistic electrons and positrons generated by hadronic proton  proton collisions are one , among others , viable explanation of the cluster  sized diffuse radio haloes , observed in a significant fraction of galaxy clusters .",
    "the amount of cosmic ray energy required to power those radio haloes is moderate and comparable to the expected magnetic field energy @xcite . since",
    "cosmic ray protons are confined by chaotic magnetic field lines , they are likely to accumulate in turbulent regions of the universe , and especially in clusters @xcite .      in our own galaxy , the cosmic ray energy density is of order of the magnetic energy density @xcite . in general , the cosmic rays that accumulate over cosmic times",
    "should be relativistic , since sub ",
    "relativistic protons can suffer from severe coulomb energy losses in the dense ism and icm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if we take this into account , we can approximate the equation of state of the cosmic ray gas with a polytrope with adiabatic index @xmath158 .",
    "this implies that the cosmic ray  producing gas suffers exactly the same ( relative ) adiabatic energy losses as the ( turbulent ) magnetic fields .",
    "thus , we can assume that the cosmic ray energy injected in winds is identical to the magnetic energy density and in our wind description we can read any magnetic field energy density also as a cosmic ray energy density , that is @xmath159 .",

    "if this were to happen , the cosmic rays would contribute momentum to the wind and an appropriate term @xmath160 should be included in equation [ label ] .",
    "this injection of momentum by cosmic rays could in principle provide a wind with the necessary kick to escape from a galaxy where star formation is not very intense",
    ".    the equipartition of energy between magnetic fields and cosmic rays may not be true in all environments .",
    "in cosmic ray  driven outflows , for example , the cosmic rays leave the galaxy without ejecting much gas or magnetic fields . in this case",
    ", the contribution of winds to the cosmic ray content of the icm and igm could be much higher than our estimate .",
    "hence , our results about the ejection of cosmic rays should be treated as lower limits .",
    "the small energy density in injected cosmic rays can also be substantially boosted by the action of structure formation .",
    "it is expected that every gas volume in the igm which ends up in the icm is passed by shock waves of different strength several times .",
    "many of these shock waves have low mach numbers , implying that they are very inefficient in accelerating particles out of the thermal pool .",
    "however , any pre  existing relativistic particle population is able to gain substantial energy by the passage of even weak shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". furthermore , resonant interactions with turbulent plasma waves can also energise old cosmic ray populations to some degree @xcite .",
    "we do not attempt an estimate of the cosmic ray amplification processes .",

    "we have presented new semi  analytic simulations of magnetised galactic winds emerging from star forming galaxies .",
    "our set of n  body simulations of structure formation in an approximately spherical region of space of diameter 52 @xmath22 mpc combines a high mass resolution with a region of space large enough to allow us to simulate the evolution of the winds in their proper cosmological context .",
    "we have implemented new recipes for the transport of magnetic fields into the igm and icm by outflows on top of the pre  existing semi  analytic scheme for the evolution of winds of bsw05 , which uses the galaxy formation model of @xcite .",
    "the assumption that the magnetic fields only weakly affect the global evolution of winds is well justified by the finding that the total energy of the outflow is several orders of magnitude higher than its magnetic energy .",
    "here we have presented two different scenarios for the transport of magnetic fields in winds and for each scenario we have analysed two models corresponding to high and low wind efficiency to blow and travel far into the igm .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the ability of winds to travel far into the igm strongly depends on their mass loading efficieny : the more mass is accreted from the ambient medium , the lower is the probability that winds can blow out of galaxies .",
    "the mass loading efficiency is parameterized in the wind model by the constant @xmath40 . unfortunately",
    ", no direct observational evidence is available to constrain this paremeter .    in both scenarios ,",
    "we have neglected any possible field amplification process due to cosmic shear and turbulence in clusters .",
    "these processes are far too complex to be treated correctly in semi  analytic models . in what we called our conservative scenario",
    "we do not consider any amplification mechanism , but we take into account the dilution of the magnetic fields due to the adiabatic expansion of the magnetic field lines inside winds .",
    "this implies that the results of our conservative models should be regarded as lower limits to any seed magnetisation of the universe .",
    "conversely , in our optimistic scenario we do consider a simple prescription for the amplification of magnetic fields in winds , due to the shear motions of the material inside the wind cavities and bubbles .",
    "in the two optimistic models , we consider an efficient amplification of the magnetic fields by the internal shear motions and we set up our prescriptions by assuming that the amplification by shear motions counterbalances the dilution due to the adiabatic expansion .    since cosmic rays can be strongly coupled to turbulent magnetic fields , the simulations also allow us to follow the seeding of cosmic rays by galactic winds in the igm and icm .",
    "given our assumption that the magnetic energy density equals the cosmic ray energy density , in our simulations the cosmic rays are spatially distributed in the same way as the magnetic fields .",
    "we find that the magnetic fields ejected by galaxies with stellar masses @xmath14 m@xmath13 can fill a substantial fraction of our simulated volume , producing a mean ( seed ) magnetisation of order @xmath161 to @xmath162 g in the conservative models and of order @xmath144 to @xmath135 g in the optimistic models .",
    "magnetic field are not uniformly distributed in space , but rather seem to roughly follow the large scale distribution of the underlying dark matter density field .",
    "the ejection of magnetic fields and cosmic rays by galactic winds is efficient enough to explain the magnetic fields and cosmic ray energy densities observed or expected in clusters , if additional mechanisms intervene to amplify the magnetic fields and to energise the cosmic rays by a further factor of 10 to 1000 .",
    "amplification mechanisms such as cosmic shear , dynamo effects and others ( see section [ amplb ] for a discussion ) do operate while the fields are ejected by winds into the icm and igm .",
    "it remains to be shown , however , whether the cosmic ray protons transported by winds can be re ",
    "accelerated by intergalactic shocks and turbulence to the level expected in galaxy clusters from the existence of radio haloes , which might be of hadronic origin .",
    "our model does not exclude _ a priori _ an additional primordial magnetic field .",

    "<S> we find that galactic winds are able to seed a substantial fraction of the cosmic volume with magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> most regions affected by winds have magnetic fields in the range @xmath0 g , while higher seed fields can be obtained only rarely and in close proximity to wind  blowing galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these seed fields are sufficiently intense for a moderately efficient turbulent dynamo to amplify them to the observed values . </S>",
    "<S> the volume filling factor of the magnetised regions strongly depends on the efficiency of winds to load mass from the ambient medium . </S>",
    "<S> however , winds never completely fill the whole universe and pristine gas can be found in cosmic voids and regions unaffected by feedback even at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that , in principle , there might be the possibility to probe the existence of primordial magnetic fields in such regions .    </S>",
