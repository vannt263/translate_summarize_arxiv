    "following the progress in the fabrication and mechanical exfoliation of the graphene  @xcite , extraordinary low - dimensional electrical and mechanical properties of graphene have been revealed  @xcite .",
    "currently , mass - scale fabrication of graphene - based devices free from defects and imperfections requires chemical processing with high quality product and is one of the challenging technological problems for graphene device technology .",
    "for example , the micro - mechanical cleavage of graphite  @xcite , epitaxial growth on silicon carbide  @xcite , chemical vapor deposition of hydrocarbons on transition metal surfaces  @xcite have shown difficulties in obtaining processable graphene sheets in large quantities thus impeding full exploitation of its exciting properties .",
    "chemical oxidation of graphite and subsequent exfoliation in solution allow a large scale production of isolated graphene oxide ( go ) . however , the reduction of go is known to create many structural defects degrading the material properties of reduced go . hence identifying reliable methods that allow removal of oxygen from",
    "go with minimum damage to c - sp@xmath0 bonds in graphene - structures is the focus of current research activities .",
    "recently studies have shown that the chemical reduction of graphite oxide can be a low - cost and scalable method  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that layered materials constituting graphene layers functionalized with epoxy and hydroxyl groups are easily exfoliated in water .",
    "the resulting graphene oxide ( go ) monolayers can be deposited in controllable density onto a large variety of substrates , thus enabling the preparation of thin conductive films on solid and flexible substrates  @xcite .",
    "it is accepted that go can be described as a random distribution of oxidized areas with the oxygenated functional groups , combined with nonoxidized regions wherein most of the carbon atoms preserve sp@xmath0 hybridization  @xcite .",
    "go is electrically insulating material , however , its conductivity can improve up to 4 orders of magnitude by chemical reduction  @xcite , nevertheless the typical conductivities of reduced go ( rgo ) is still lower than pristine graphene by a factor of 10 - 100  @xcite due to presence of residual functional groups remaining after reduction .",
    "in contrast to mechanically exfoliated graphene , the chemically derived graphene ( i.e. , rgo ) is found to contain a considerable amount of topological defects .",
    "similar to other low - dimensional carbon nanostructures like carbon nanotubes  @xcite , graphene ribbons  @xcite , fullerenes  @xcite and more recently graphene quantum dots  @xcite , topological defects and etch - holes ( that are unavoidable products of the reduction process ) are expected to strongly affect the device electronic and mechanical performance , and thus to account for the differences between rgo and pristine graphene .",
    "recent advances in computational modeling of materials such as molecular dynamic ( md ) simulations and ab - initio calculation have enabled researchers to provide detailed studies in the microscopic level and allows a careful analysis of the chemical reactions and diffusion mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "such studies are helpful in identifying the experimental conditions that allows the minimization of mechanical and chemical damages to graphene and the optimization of their performance  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we employ md simulations based on ab - initio cpmd  @xcite and reaxff  @xcite which are the mathematical formulation that governs the appropriate dynamics of the molecular system to analyze the carbon - oxygen chemical reaction and reduction process .",
    "we show that the go structural relaxation assisted with the oxygen surface diffusion that allows the migration of epoxy functional groups and protects the c - sp@xmath0 bonds , preserve the integrity of the graphene lattice structure and governs the dynamical pathway in low temperatures .",
    "in contrast , in high temperatures , consistent with recent finding of ref .",
    "@xcite , we show that the formation of carbonyl is dynamically favorable and can be accounted for dominant mechanism in breaking c - sp@xmath0 bonds .",
    "we then consider immersed systems of go in dilute gas of hydrogen using two large - scale structural models for go and demonstrate the effect of hydrogen in removal of oxygen , blocking the carbonyl pair formation and finally seek for conditions in which structural damage to c - sp@xmath0 bonds is minimized .",
    "the atomic model structure of large scale go is constructed by including randomly distributed hydroxyl and epoxy functional groups to a single - graphene sheet .",
    "the dynamical stability of the entire structure in particular the functional groups attached to the graphene will be investigated by performing md in which the time evolution of the system and its environment is calculated .",
    "the system consists of go in vacuum or immersed in hydrogen gas can exchange energy and particles with the environment . in vacuum",
    "the exchange of energy is possible by contacting go with a canonical thermostat that keeps temperature constant after reaching the thermodynamic equilibrium . in this case",
    "the exchange of particles is possible either if the functional groups in go are in a highly unstable configuration or if they undergo a chemical reaction and form chemical complexes .",
    "if the molecules formed by such complexes are stable they can be detached from their host and diffuse thermally away from go . in an environment rich with hydrogen molecules",
    "we further expect that the reaction - diffusion processes are accounted for the particle exchange between go and its environment .",
    "our ab - initio / dft calculation consists of car - parrinello molecular dynamics ( cpmd ) model  @xcite , in which the potential energy of the system can be calculated on the fly , as needed for the conformations of the dynamical trajectory to simulate the chemical reaction pathways .",
    "it is implemented in a plane - wave basis within local spin density approximation ( lsda ) with an energy cutoff of 70 ry ( rydberg ) , and with becke  @xcite exchange and lee - yang - parr ( blyp ) gradient - corrected functional  @xcite .",
    "norm conserving ultrasoft vanderbilt pseudopotentials were used for oxygen , hydrogen , and carbon .",
    "the cpmd microcanonical dynamics ( constant energy ensemble ) that allows achieving dynamical equilibration for @xmath1300 - 1500 k were performed , after wave function optimization .",
    "then a requenching of the wave function and canonical cpmd is performed .",
    "a supercell with periodic boundary condition in the plane of graphene with poisson solver of martyna and tuckerman was used  @xcite .",
    "our approach for reactive md consists of reaxff  @xcite implemented in large - scale atomic / molecular massively parallel simulator ( lammps )  @xcite .",
    "the consistency and accuracy of reaxff with dft calculation is checked systematically by employing ab - initio cpmd  @xcite . in reaxff",
    "the atomic interactions are described by the reactive force field potential  @xcite .",
    "reaxff is a general bond - order dependent potential that provides accurate descriptions of bond breaking and bond formation .",
    "recent simulations on a number of hydrocarbon - oxygen systems  @xcite , go  @xcite , and organic molecules  @xcite showed that reaxff reliably provides energies , transition states , reaction pathways and reactivity trends in agreement with ab - initio calculations and experiments .",
    "the information on the type of chemical reactions and the time - evolution of the damage is collected via running the md up to 5 ps where the rearrangement of the atomic coordinates have been deduced from a dynamical trajectory calculated by reaxff .",
    "these simulations performed using periodic boundary conditions in a canonical npt ensemble with a nose - hoover thermostat for temperature control and a time step of 0.25 fs .",

    "the transition for breaking c - c bond requires passing through an energy barrier @xmath3ev . in high temperatures the shear force induced by anti - parallel and out - of - plane vibrational modes of oxygen - carbon bonds acting on carbon - carbon bonds provide enough kinetic energy that allows passing through the transition state . in this case the in - plane c - sp@xmath0 bond breaks and the formation of carbonyl pair lowers the local strain energy of graphene .",
    "in lower temperatures , however , the vibrational energy is not large enough to break the c - c bonds .",
    "instead , system finds another pathway to a stable configuration by moving two oxygen one lattice constant away from each other such that it lowers the planar strain energy .",
    "this relaxation of local energy is assisted by the surface diffusion of the oxygen pairs .",
    "because the chemical bond breaking is much faster process than mechanical expansion of the graphene lattice structure , the structural relaxation in achieving the minimum energy configuration for a carbonyl pair occurs faster than epoxy pair . within 0.6 ps of cpmd time",
    ", we find the energy difference between two lowest - energy configurations of carbonyl and epoxy pairs @xmath9 ev .",
    "however , a small and steady negative - slope seen in ks energy of epoxy pairs implies that the energy of epoxy pair asymptotically falls to a lower energy than the energy of carbonyl - pair .",
    "as the oxygenation of the graphene involves with passing through a large energy barrier in the reaction - diffusion processes , and because the ground state energy of both carbonyl and epoxy configurations are approximately degenerate , the carbonyl formation is expected to be dominant at high temperature where the vibrational modes of the oxygen - carbon bonds fluctuate strongly and thus oxygen becomes more damaging whereas in lower temperature the dominant surface diffusion allows stability of the epoxy groups without forming the structural holes . in the latter case",

    "some interesting events responsible for the structural improvement of graphene sheet and observed in our simulation include the collision between hydrogen molecules and oxygen functional groups that lead to capturing of hydrogen by oxygen and formation of a hydroxyl group on the surface of go and finally formation of free water and hydronium molecules . in high temperatures where the average kinetic energy of hydrogen molecules is larger",

    "we can single out a process in which a hydrogen molecule dissociated by two neighboring oxygen atoms and form a pair of hydroxyl groups close to each other . because this chemical reaction involves the energy transfer from hydrogen molecules to newly formed hydroxyl groups , the underlying c - c bonds undergo strong fluctuations that increases the chance of c - c bond breaking .",

    "ab - initio cpmd and reaxff molecular dynamic calculations performed in this work reveal that annealing of graphene - oxide in low - temperatures allows prevention of the structural damages due to relaxation of the lattice structure assisted by the oxygen surface diffusion .",
    "our analysis indicates that the migration of epoxy functional groups provide a protection mechanism for c - sp@xmath0 bonds hence preserving the integrity of the graphene honeycomb structure .",
    "we further demonstrate that a chemically active environment , e.g. enriched with hydrogen gas , can assist removal of oxygen and blocks formation of carbonyl pairs , hence hindering the structural damage of go either because of physical pressure exerted by the gas or imposed by chemical reactions .",
    "our analysis shows that hydrogen in environment do not suppress c - c bond breaking , but that h facilitate continuous removal of oxygen leading to reduced c - o bonding in go , consistent with the expectation on the role of hydrogen in go reduction .",
    "finally , the results obtained in our studies can be used as a guideline for identifying the experimental conditions that allows minimization of the mechanical and chemical damages to graphene and optimization of their performance .",

    "<S> we employ molecular dynamic simulations to study the reduction process of graphene - oxide ( go ) in a chemically active environment enriched with hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the concentration and pressure of hydrogen gas as a function of temperature in which abstraction of oxygen is possible with minimum damage to c - sp@xmath0 bonds hence preserving the integrity of the graphene sheet . through these studies we find chemical pathways that demonstrate beneficiary mechanisms for the quality of graphene including formation of water as well as suppression of carbonyl pair holes in favor of hydroxyl and epoxy formation facilitated by hydrogen gas in the environment . </S>"
