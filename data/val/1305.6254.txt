    "the rapid advances in communications technology and mobile network market have urged the research community to direct its efforts towards novel communications paradigms that can offer a better system performance .",
    "already resources as time , frequency and space have been exhaustively explored , leading to the suggestion of systems with high degrees of freedom including the random access ( ra ) , the multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) and the orthogonal - frequency - division - multiple - access ( ofdma ) channel .",
    "one of the current tendencies , which extends the above , is to understand wireless networks as cooperative entities .",
    "conceptually , the idea of cooperative communications is that nodes should communicate with each other and try to adapt their transmission behavior in such a way , that their own as well as the entire system performance is improved .",
    "cooperation can be understood either as ( a ) coordination of node actions after certain exchange of messages between neighbours , or ( b ) as full cooperation by concurrent transmission of the same data towards a receiver node .",
    "the latter type of cooperation is possible , when full data and/or channel state information is exchanged between the cooperating elements .    for cellular architectures ,",
    "a recent suggestion in 3 g and 4 g systems has been the cooperative multipoint transmission ( comp ) @xcite , where neighbouring base stations ( bss ) exchange data and/or channel information over backhaul links . with use of appropriate precoding and by exploiting the extra information , interference within this - so called - bs cluster can be cancelled out for the users in service @xcite . the concept is also known in the literature as network mimo @xcite . theoretically , the idea originates from the multiple access channel ( mac ) with conferencing , whose capacity region has been derived by willems in @xcite for the discrete memoryless case .",
    "its gaussian extension is provided by bross et al . in @xcite .",
    "grouping of bss into cooperative clusters normally requires a centralized controller , where information over the channel quality network - wide is available @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the full benefits of cooperation in throughput and coverage are known to be achieved when both data and channel state information are fully known to all the transmitters of each cluster @xcite",
    ". however , such information exchange requires a considerable amount of feedback .",
    "this is often unrealistic because of the system resources reserved .",
    "the research community aims nowadays at resolving this major issue @xcite , @xcite .",
    "approaches to solve this investigate cases of partial , delayed , quantized and limited channel state information exchange between the cooperating entities @xcite , @xcite as more realistic towards a practical system implementation @xcite .",
    "there has been a large amount of both theoretical and practical investigations of the aforementioned concepts in the literature .",
    "considering mac with conferencing , starting from the work by willems and its gaussian variant by bross et al .",
    "numerous extensions of the basic model have been considered . in @xcite ,",
    "wiese et al . have extended the discrete memoryless region to the case of compound channels with an arbitrary number of channel states .",
    "maric et al . in @xcite have derived the region for the case of 2-transmitter mac with conferencing and 2-receivers .",
    "further extensions for general @xmath0-transmitters and @xmath1-receivers are provided in @xcite , while wigger and kramer have derived the region for the 3-user mimo gaussian mac with conferencing in @xcite . a work which departs from the standard model , but considers channels of 2-transmitters and 2-receivers with cooperation in either of the two or both ends of the channel , is found in @xcite by jindal et al . there , the transmitters are equipped with multiple antennas and jointly encode both messages using dirty paper coding .    related to comp ,",
    "the authors in @xcite investigate a 2-transmitter 2-receiver model and derive from willems capacity region an achievable rate region , when each bs sends a private and a common message to both receivers .",
    "further works treating @xmath2 models are @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "practical schemes to implement cooperation , combining private / common message and dirty paper coding are found in @xcite .",
    "optimal methods to form cooperation clusters between bss are investigated in @xcite using tools from integer programming and in @xcite based on the concept of sparse precoding . in @xcite hardjawana",
    "investigate transmitter structures for a system with @xmath3 cooperating bss @xmath4 @xmath3 users . finally , many tutorial papers on implementation issues of comp deal with the lingering issue of channel state information feedback , that is necessary to achieve the promised cooperation benefits @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the existing research , as shown above , has been limited to models with a small number ( usually two ) of cooperating transmitters and one or more receivers .",
    "the aim is to derive performance benefits when cooperation is incorporated and to suggest optimal or practical transmission and reception schemes within the cluster of communicating nodes . on the other hand , the influence of cooperation and the inter - cluster interference effects on a network level",
    "is not yet thoroughly investigated .",
    "we aim here at analyzing the performance of cooperation in terms of coverage , in a network with an infinite number of nodes .",
    "a first approach to this problem ( done in parallel to the authors work ) is found by akoum and heath in @xcite , where bss and users are positioned on the euclidean plane as independent poisson point processes .",
    "the concept of random clustering is used to define cooperation clusters , whose bss transmit using intercell interference nulling .",
    "although this work aims at analyzing the network in its generality , it does neither consider the issue of the optimal cluster choice ( because of the random way cooperation clusters are formed ) nor questions of power consumption .",
    "furthermore , the model does not deal with the novel interference field which arises when cooperation is applied network - wide .",
    "our work here primarily aims at providing a _ general framework _ to treat problems of cooperation between pairs of cellular nodes at a network level .",
    "the framework utilizes stochastic geometry to derive exact closed form or integral expressions and evaluate network performance when its nodes are assumed randomly scattered on the infinite plane .",
    "we consider scenarios of cooperation with data exchange between the optimal pairs of nodes .",
    "the present paper is focused on the case where only limited information over the channel is available such as phase shift and second neighbour interference .",
    "the reason for such approach is due to the fact that full information exchange , although may allow perfect adaptation of the transmitters to the channel state , it requires a considerable - often unrealistic - amount of inter - cell feedback exchange .",
    "the current analysis can however easily be extended to the case full channel knowledge and beamformer adaptation to the instantaneous channel state , but this is left for future investigation and comparison with the current work . more specifically , our basic model * assumptions * in this work are as follows :    * the bss are distributed on the infinite two - dimensional ( 2d ) plane as the realization of a poisson point process ( p.p.p . ) with intensity @xmath5 . *",
    "each bs @xmath6 is the center of a cell , defined as the locus of planar points closest to @xmath6 than any other atom of the point process .",
    "this is called a 1-voronoi cell @xmath7 .",
    "* one user is randomly positioned within each cell of the network .",
    "* at most two bss may cooperate for the service of a single user .",
    "these are the first @xmath8 and second @xmath9 closest geographic neighbours of each user , who then lies within their 2-voronoi cell @xmath10 . in this sense ,",
    "the bs cooperation pair is chosen by each user and not by a central controller entity .",
    "practical issues on knowledge acquisition of the bs - user distance are resolved by averaging over multiple instantaneous channel realizations @xcite to cancel out the random effect of fast - fading . *",
    "the cooperation scenario is similar to the concept of willems coding with conferencing @xcite .",
    "this means here that the original message is split into a private and a common part sent by the cooperating pair to the user .",
    "the common part is exchanged over the backhaul . *",
    "the power consumed per user is fixed to @xmath0 . no power constraint per bs",
    "is considered . *",
    "fast - fading from each bs to each user is modeled by a complex number , whose absolute value @xmath11 is an independent random variable ( r.v . ) with rayleigh distribution ( consequently its power @xmath12 follows the exponential distribution ) and whose angle @xmath13 is an independent r.v . with uniform distribution in @xmath14 .",
    "* limited channel state information is considered .",
    "specifically the analysis assumes that the transmitters know and exchange the angular shifts resulting from complex fading , so that the reception is in - phase at the user side .",
    "the purpose of such modeling assumption is to investigate benefits from scenarios of cooperation that avoid exhaustive information exchange between transmitters within a cluster . in our case ,",
    "the information exchange is limited to just the phase of the channel and not the amplitude , which is a considerable feedback gain .",
    "+ furthermore , we analyze the case where interference from the second base station is non - causally known , and the transmission from the pair is adapted to the latter by application of dirty paper coding @xcite .",
    "this case does not assume further channel knowledge ( i.e. does not refer to the standard combined zero forcing and dirty paper coding scheme in @xcite ) and its purpose is to give an optimistic evaluation of our limited feedback scheme .",
    "* a subset of users choses no cooperation ( siso channels ) whereas its complementary subset choses full coopeartion ( @xmath15 miso channel ) . * the choice to cooperate or not is dictated by a family of user - optimal policies , which is one of the main novelties of our work .",
    "these policies are strictly geometric and a user choses between them ( as binary actions ) based on the relative value of the ratio @xmath16 ( of distances from its first and second bs neighbor ) to the design parameter @xmath17 .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 influences the width of some geometric zone of cooperation between the cells of the two neighbouring bss and is left as an optimization variable .",
    "the major * results * can be summarized as follows :    * the chosen communication scenario and action policies result in a specific @xmath18 expression .",
    "* the coverage probability of a typical planar point is derived , given an @xmath18 threshold @xmath19 .",
    "the coverage further depends on the value of geometric parameter @xmath17 .",
    "explicit expressions are provided . *",
    "the network - wide interference is modeled as a shot - noise field , which explicitly takes into consideration the special influence of cooperation between bss .",
    "the interference r.v . is provided together with its laplace transform and expected value .",
    "it can be seen that although different cooperation schemes lead to the same expected value for interference , the same does not hold for its higher moments . *",
    "the work considers the possibility of interference elimination of the non - beneficial signal coming from the second closest neighbour .",
    "this can be achieved when the interference created to the typical user is measured and known to both miso transmitters . in this case dirty paper coding ( dpc ) can be applied , described in @xcite . * the coverage expressions for both scenarios ( with and without dpc )",
    "are numerically evaluated and the benefits of cooperation with geometric policies are illustrated in plots .",
    "simulation results are compared with the theoretical ones to guarantee the validity of the results . * * it is concluded that : * cooperation ( in the sense of conferencing here ) is substantially beneficial for network coverage even with limited channel adaptive schemes and when cooperation is restricted between two neighbouring bss .",
    "dpc significantly improves these benefits .",
    "* coverage regions change their shape when varying parameter @xmath17 . due to",
    "the geometric policies suggested , advantage is always given to planar areas closer to the cell boundaries .",
    "let us stress that beyond these particular results on cooperation with limited channel knowledge , the main contribution of the present paper is the new framework in which these questions are analyzed .",
    "the k - voronoi diagram allows one to identify the region where certain k - tuples of antennas constitute the optimal @xmath20-cluster .",
    "poisson stochastic geometry allows one to analyze e.g. the probability of coverage but potentially other performance measures as well .",
    "this framework can be extended to optimal cooperation by more than two base stations , to a variety of cooperation schemes and to a variety of assumptions on channel knowledge .",
    "our work is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sectionii ] presents the general model of cooperation .",
    "specifically , it explains the geometric notions , gives the modeling assumptions and describes the conferencing power - split scenario .",
    "the last part presents the policies of no / full cooperation used and the resulting cooperation zones at the cell boundaries , which are controlled by parameter @xmath17 .",
    "section [ sectioniii ] provides the derivation of the expressions for the coverage probability using stochastic geometry .",
    "the laplace transform of the full cooperation signal is derived and a probabilistic comparison with the siso signal is given . the interference is described as a r.v . and its properties and expected value are provided .",
    "the section includes the variation of the above expressions when interference from the second closest neighbour is eliminated by use of dpc .",

    "the communications scenario in this work uses the following idea .",
    "when two bss cooperatively serve a user in the downlink , its signal is split into one * common part * served by both , and * private parts * served by each one of the serving bss .",
    "the common part contains information known to both transmitters , that is exchanged between them over a reliable conferencing link . the idea is originally based on the seminal work of willems @xcite , where the author derives the capacity region of the multiple access channel ( mac ) with conferencing , in the case that two transmitters cooperate over backhaul links to provide service to a single receiver .",
    "the proof of achievability is precisely based on such a splitting of the user s signal .",
    "the capacity region for the gaussian noise case has been derived by bross et al . for the @xmath15 model in @xcite and maric et al for the @xmath2 model in @xcite . in both cases",

    "a variation of the idea has been applied in a network - mimo setting by zakhour and gesbert for the @xmath62 model in @xcite , where the beamforming vectors take the role of signal weights and define the power - split - ratios .    in this work",
    "we assume that only the information over channel phase shift is available at the transmission pair ( and the interference from the second base station , in the dpc case later on ) , so that full adaptation of the signal to the instantaneous channel conditions is not possible .",
    "the purpose is to analyze schemes with limited information exchange . for each primary user @xmath52 located within the 1-voronoi cell of atom @xmath34 , consider a signal @xmath63 to be transmitted .",

    "considering power issues , we put the constraint that the powers transmitted from both bss to serve user @xmath52 should sum up to @xmath0 to guarantee * power conservation*. this is similar to the beamforming normalization , found in @xcite .",

    "[ fig : b2p5 ]",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a general methodology to treat problems of cooperation in cellular networks , in the case where data exchange is allowed only between pairs of nodes .",
    "the framework developed uses tools from stochastic geometry to model the random positions of nodes on the plane and calculate the network performance with reference to a typical location .    in our work",
    "the focus has been on the evaluation of the coverage probability , using a specific cooperation scheme .",
    "this scheme is based on the idea of conferencing by willems , where two transmitters encode a common message after exchange of information over the backhaul .",
    "we give to the service of each user two possibilities .",
    "either to be served by its closest bs or to ask from the two closest ones to cooperate .",
    "the latter choice splits the total user power between these two bss , which encode the same common message .",
    "the scheme results in an additional term on the beneficial received signal due to the correlated nature of the two transmissions .",
    "the treated cooperation scheme assumes only the knowledge of the fast - fading angular shift at the cooperation pair , so that transmission is done in a way that the two signals add up in - phase at the receiver and the maximum signal power benefit is obtained .",
    "the purpose of this assumption on limited channel state information exchange was to investigate possible coverage benefits , that can result without the necessity of exhaustive channel state feedback and full - channel beamformer adaptation .",
    "the stochastic geometry framework introduce here , can be applied to the evaluation of other types of cooperation , as is the case where the transmitters have full knowledge of the instantaneous channel gains and adapt their functionality to it .",
    "treatment of such cases is very important , since it may reveal higher performance benefits , at the cost of additional information at the transmitter side , and is our future research direction .    to investigate cooperation ,",
    "we have defined a set of geometric user - defined policies for the user actions .",
    "depending on the ratio @xmath16 and some design parameter @xmath128 $ ] , a user may ask for bs cooperation or not .",
    "it was shown that the cooperation regions are regions close to the cell borders .",
    "the width of such zones is determined by the parameter @xmath17 . outside such zones",
    ", the user always chooses not to cooperate .",
    "the evaluation of coverage , given that the positions of bs atoms follow a p.p.p . and",
    "the fast fading from a single bs to a user follows an exponential distribution , has shown gains when geometric policies of cooperation with conferencing are used , compared to the traditional cellular cell - centered architectures .",
    "the expression of @xmath272 in ( [ tint1])+([tint2 ] ) with interference r.v . @xmath24 and @xmath227 respectively , for the cases without and with interference elimination from the second closest bs ( by application of dirty paper coding ) quantifies the increase in gains with the increase in available information . without any information and based just on power splitting , the gains are visible for @xmath281 and reach a maximum of over @xmath274 improvement in coverage area .",
    "the situation improves considerably when dpc is applied ( but no zero forcing ) to adapt to the interfering signals coming from the serving pair , and the gains are visible for the entire domain of @xmath19 .",
    "an improvement of up to @xmath282 is apparent in coverage .",
    "another important benefit has been on the change of the shapes of coverage areas by an appropriate choice of the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "cell boundary regions are favored by cooperation since the absolute gain in coverage is concentrated there .",
    "furthermore , the geometric , user - located policies suggested here are not necessarily the optimal ones .",
    "better policies can most probably be obtained when the instantaneous channel fast - fading is known or when the relative influence of the action choice ( @xmath125 or @xmath122 ) on the neighbouring cells is taken into consideration .",
    "optimal policies are expected to be non - geometric .",
    "the issue which requires intensive research and is the direction for future investigations , is the choice of the number of cooperating bss as well as the type of cooperation . in our work",
    "we have chosen to apply cooperation in the sense of power - splitting of the user message between two cooperating transmitters , as well as data exchange and linearly dependent encoding after conferencing .",
    "dpc is applied when the knowledge over second neighbour bs interference is available .",
    "however , the cooperation will have a different form if complex beamformers are available .",
    "knowledge over the channel quality can allow for adaptive transmission by use of a zero - forcing or other type of precoder .",
    "additional to that , a larger number of cooperating bss ( greater than two ) , will as well have different results on the received @xmath18 at the receiver side .",
    "the above discussions show that there is a potential for improvement on the results presented here and many further steps can be taken to analyze alternative cooperation schemes . the basic methodology presented in this work can provide the analytical framework to facilitate later extensions to the directions mentioned above .",
    "the results derived from our model , which assumes limited channel knowledge at the transmission pair , show that cooperation can be a very profitable scheme , which improves system performance , without exploitation of further network resources ( frequency , time or power ) by appropriate information data exchange between network nodes .",
    "the coverage gains from such cooperation strictly between pairs of neighbouring nodes range up to @xmath282 and favor the areas close to the cell edge .",
