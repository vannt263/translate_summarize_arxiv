    "recently , quantum dots have attracted a considerable interest due to their potential applicability as single electron transistors or as basic building blocks ( qubits ) in the fabrication of quantum computers.@xcite in the last years , a great amount of work has also been devoted to studying the kondo effect in mesoscopic structures.@xcite a motivation for these efforts was the recent experimental observation of the kondo effect in tunneling through a small quantum dot in the kondo regime.@xcite in these experiments , the excess electronic _",
    "spin _ of the dot acts as a magnetic impurity .",
    "let us also mention that the manipulation of magnetic cobalt atoms on a copper surface and more specifically the observation of the associated kondo resonance via spectroscopy tunneling measurements@xcite also stands for a remarkable opportunity to probe spin kondo physics at the mesoscopic scale but in another realm ( not with artificial structures ) .    a different set of problems relating the kondo effect to the physics of quantum dots",
    "is encountered when investigating the charge fluctuations of a large coulomb - blockaded quantum dot ( metallic grain).@xcite more precisely , one of the most important features of a quantum dot is the coulomb blockade phenomenon , i.e. , as a result of the strong repulsion between electrons , the charge of a quantum dot is quantized in units of the elementary charge @xmath4 .",
    "even a metallic dot at a micronmetric scale can still behave as a good single - electron transistor . when the gate voltage @xmath5 is increased the charge of the grain changes in a step - like manner .",
    "this behavior is referred to as a coulomb staircase .",
    "moreover when the metallic dot is weakly - coupled to a bulk lead , so that electrons can hop from the lead to the dot and back , the dot charge remains to a large extent quantized .",
    "this quantization has been investigated with thoroughness both theoretically@xcite and experimentally.@xcite it is important to bear in mind that such a problem is intrinsically connected to an _ orbital _ or charge kondo effect.@xcite indeed , near the degeneracy points of the average charge in the grain one can effectively map the problem of charge fluctuations onto a ( planar ) two - channel kondo hamiltonian@xcite with the two charge configurations in the box playing the role of the impurity spin@xcite and the physical spin of the conduction electrons acting as a passive channel index .",
    "( this mapping is _ a priori _ valid only for weak tunneling junctions between the grain and the lead ) . for accessible temperatures  in general , larger than the level spacing of the grain ",
    "spin kondo physics is not relevant.@xcite the quantity of interest is the average dot charge as a function of the voltage applied to a back - gate . note that the average dot charge can be measured with sensitivity well below a single charge.@xcite unfortunately , only some fingerprints of the two - channel kondo effect were recently observed for a setting in semiconductor quantum dots.@xcite indeed , the non - fermi liquid nature of the two - channel kondo effect is hardly accessible in the matveev s setup built on semiconducting devices.@xcite on the one hand , the charging energy of the grain must be large enough to maximize the kondo temperature @xmath6 on the other hand the level spacing must be small enough compared to @xmath6 .",
    "it is difficult to satisfy these two conflicting limits .",
    "a better chance for observing the two - channel kondo behavior may be reached if tunneling between the lead and the grain involves a resonant level since it offers the possibility to actually enhance the kondo temperature of the system.@xcite    in this paper , the setup we analyze consists of a single - electron box or grain coupled to a reservoir through a smaller dot ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we assume that the smaller dot contains an odd number of electrons and eventually acts as an s=1/2 kondo impurity.@xcite typically , when only charge kondo flips are involved the low energy physics near the degeneracy points is well described by a two - channel kondo model , in particular the capacitance peaks of the grain exhibit at zero temperature a logarithmic singularity at the degeneracy points which ensures a nice coulomb staircase even for not too weak couplings between the quantum box and the lead.@xcite in our setup , the kondo effect has now two possible origins : the spin due to the presence of the small dot playing the role of an s=1/2 spin impurity and the orbital degeneracy on the grain . combining wilson s numerical renormalization - group ( nrg ) method with perturbative scaling approaches we extend our previous work,@xcite and emphasize that at ( and near ) the degeneracy points of the grain , the two kondo effects can be intertwined .",
    "the orbital degrees of freedom of the grain become strongly entangled with the spin degrees of freedom of the small dot resulting in a stable fixed point with an su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "this requires symmetric or slightly asymmetric tunneling junctions .",
    "furthermore , the low energy fixed point is a fermi - liquid which considerably smears out the coulomb staircase behavior and hampers the matveev logarithmic singularity to arise.@xcite remember that the major consequence of this enlarged symmetry in our setup is that the grain capacitance exhibits instead of a logarithmic singularity , a strongly reduced peak as a function of the back - gate voltage , smearing charging effects in the grain considerably .",
    "it is also worth noting that the kondo effect is maximized when both kondo effects occur simultaneously .",
    "in particular , the associated kondo temperature @xmath2 can be strongly enhanced compared to that of the matveev s original setup which may guarantee the verification of our predictions .",
    "we stress that the coulomb staircase behavior becomes smeared out already in the weak tunneling limit due to the appearance of spin - flip assisted tunneling . a different limit where the small dot rather acts as a resonant level close to the fermi level has been studied in refs . [ ] where in contrast it was shown that the resonant level has only a slight influence on the smearing of the coulomb blockade even if the transmission coefficient through the impurity is one at resonance .",
    "this differs markedly from the case of an energy - independent transmission coefficient where the coulomb staircase is completely destroyed for perfect transmission.@xcite furthermore , the charge of the grain in such a device can be used to measure the occupation of the dot.@xcite the resonant - level behavior of ref .",
    "[ ] is also recovered in our setup when an orbital magnetic field is applied .",
    "let us mention that the possibility of a strongly correlated kondo ground state possessing an su(4 ) symmetry has also been discussed very recently in the different context of two small dots coupled with a strong capacitive inter - dot coupling.@xcite the possibility of orbital and spin kondo effects in such a geometry was previously anticipated by schn _",
    "et al._@xcite inspired by preliminary experiments of ref .  [ ] .",
    "it is worth noting that these types of problems have also potential connections with the twofold orbitally degenerate anderson impurity model@xcite and more precisely with the physics of certain heavy fermions like ube@xmath7 where the u ion is modeled by a non - magnetic quadrupolar doublet@xcite and then quadrupolar ( orbital ) and spin kondo effects can in principle interfere.@xcite    our paper is structured as follows : in section ii , we resort to a schrieffer - wolff transformation and derive the effective model including the different useful parameters . in section iii , assuming that we are far from the degeneracy points of the grain we use a pedestrian perturbation theory ; this reveals the importance of spin flips even in this limit . in section iv , we carefully investigate both theoretically and numerically the interplay between orbital and spin kondo effects at the degeneracy points . in section",
    "v , we discuss in details the effects of possible symmetry breaking perturbations and the crossovers generated by such perturbations .",
    "finally , section vi is devoted to the discussion of our results and especially we summarize our main experimental predictions for such a setup .",
    "in the sequel , we analyze in details the behavior of charge fluctuations in the grain . in order to model the setup depicted in figure 1",
    ", we consider the anderson - like hamiltonian : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the annihilation operators for electrons of spin @xmath12 in the lead , the small dot , and the grain , respectively , and @xmath13 is the tunneling matrix element which we assume to be @xmath14 independent for simplification .",
    "let us first consider that tunnel junctions are _",
    "symmetric_. we also assume that junctions are narrow enough and contain one transverse channel only .",
    "extensions of the model to asymmetric or larger junctions will be analyzed later in section v. we also assume that the energy spectrum in the grain is continuous , which implies that the grain is large enough such that its level spacing @xmath15 is very small compared to its charging energy @xmath16 : @xmath17 ( in ref .",
    "[ ] @xmath18 70mk was not sufficiently small compared to the kondo temperature scale which hindered the logarithmic capacitance peak@xcite to completely develop ) .",
    "@xmath19 denotes the charge operator of the grain , @xmath20 is the capacitance between the grain and the gate electrode , and @xmath21 is related to the back - gate voltage @xmath5 through @xmath22 . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are respectively the energy level and charging energy of the small dot , and @xmath25 .",
    "the inter - dot capacitive coupling is assumed to be weak and therefore neglected .",
    "we mainly focus on the particularly interesting situation where the small dot is in the _ kondo regime _ , which requires the last level to be singly occupied and the condition @xmath26 to be satisfied @xmath27 .",
    "the resonant level limit where @xmath28 lies near the fermi level will be addressed at some points in section v. in the local moment regime , we can integrate out charge fluctuations in the small dot using a generalized schrieffer - wolff transformation.@xcite more precisely , the system is described by the hamiltonian : @xmath29 to simplify the notations , the spin indices have been omitted and hereafter .",
    "@xmath30 take values in the two sets `` lead '' ( k ) or `` grain '' ( p ) , the spin @xmath31 is the spin of the small dot , @xmath32 are pauli matrices acting on the spin space of the electrons .",
    "let us now discuss the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 in more details .    in the vicinity of one degeneracy point obtained for @xmath35 , where the grain charging states with @xmath0 and @xmath1 are degenerate",
    ", we find explicitly : @xmath36.\\ ] ] a small direct hopping term @xmath37,\\ ] ] is also present and should not be neglected .",
    "in particular , this embodies the so - called `` charge flips '' from the reservoir to the grain and vice - versa in the matveev s original problem .",
    "notice that the ratio @xmath38 can take values between -1/4 ( when @xmath39 ) and 1/4 ( when @xmath40 ) .",
    "@xmath41 corresponds to the particle - hole symmetric case where @xmath42 . for @xmath35 , the energy to add a hole or an electron onto the metallic grain vanishes and therefore the schrieffer - wolff parameters @xmath34 and @xmath33 are completely identical to those of a small dot connected to two metallic reservoirs.@xcite furthermore",
    ", remember that in the present model the ultraviolet cutoff at which the effective model becomes valid can be roughly identified to @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the level spacing of the small dot ( with today s technology it is possible to reach@xcite @xmath452 - 3k and for the grain@xcite @xmath462.3k ) .    on the other hand , far from the degeneracy point @xmath35  which means on a charge plateau  the energy to add a _ hole _ on the grain",
    "is @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , it costs @xmath49 to add an extra _ electron _ onto the grain . the lead - dot and grain - dot kondo couplings , @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively , then become _ asymmetric _ even for symmetric junctions : @xmath52=j\\\\ \\nonumber j_1 & = & 2t^2\\left[\\frac{1}{u_1-\\epsilon}+\\frac{1}{u+\\epsilon+u_{-1}}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the second equation , the virtual intermediate state where an electron first hops from the grain onto the small dot induces an excess of energy @xmath53 in the second term . the first term contains the energy of the intermediate state of the process where the temporal order of the hopping events is reversed .",
    "the off - diagonal terms where an electron from the reservoir [ grain ] flips the impurity spin and then jumps onto the grain [ reservoir ] reads @xmath54\\\\   \\nonumber j_{10 } & = & 2t^2\\left[\\frac{1}{-\\epsilon}+\\frac{1}{u+\\epsilon+u_{-1}}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in general particle - hole symmetry is absent in the large dot , so in principle @xmath55 .",
    "but , in our setting , @xmath56 , so in the following we will neglect the asymmetry between @xmath57 and @xmath58 far from the degeneracy points @xmath59 ( this has no drastic consequence on the results ) . in the finite temperature range @xmath60 ,",
    "these off - diagonal processes are suppressed exponentially as @xmath61 , whereas the diagonal spin processes can be strongly renormalized at low temperatures . in other words , in the renormalization group language , if we start at high temperature with a set of kondo couplings @xmath62 , the growing of @xmath63 is cut - off when @xmath64 is decreased below @xmath65 whereas the growing of @xmath66 is not .",
    "this offers a room to reach a 2-channel kondo effect in the spin sector ( for asymmetric tunneling junctions ) provided the condition @xmath67 can be reached with a fine - tuning of the gate voltages.@xcite we can do the same approximation for the @xmath34 term and define @xmath68 , @xmath69 accordingly ( with @xmath70 ) and also @xmath71 .",
    "we want first to compute the corrections to the average charge on the grain on a charge plateau due to the kondo and @xmath34 couplings bearing in mind that when the tunneling amplitude @xmath72 , the average grain charge @xmath73 exhibits perfect coulomb staircase behavior as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "we confine ourselves to values of @xmath21 in the range @xmath74 , which corresponds to the unperturbed ( charge ) value @xmath0 .",
    "a first natural approach is to assume that the kondo and charge - flip couplings are very small compared to the charging energy @xmath16 of the grain and to calculate the corrections to @xmath0 in perturbation theory . despite this perturbative calculation",
    "will appear of limited use , it is very instructive to perform it in order to point the different sources of divergences that appear when approaching the degeneracy points , the main issue treated in this paper . at second order , we find @xmath75 note that at finite low temperature @xmath76 , we should use the renormalized off - diagonal couplings @xmath77 which are small ( in other words the flow of the off - diagonal kondo couplings has been cut - off for @xmath76 ) .",
    "this better reproduces the ( exact ) numerical calculations of ref .  .",
    "for more details , we refer the reader to appendix a. the density of states in the lead and in the grain have been assumed to be equal@xcite and taken to be 1 for simplicity .",
    "this result tends to trivially generalize that of a grain directly coupled to a lead.@xcite however , there are two reasons that may suggest this perturbative approach is divergent .",
    "higher - order terms  already at cubic order involve logarithmic divergences associated to the renormalizations of the kondo couplings ( see appendix a ) , but also other logarithms indicating the vicinity of the degeneracy point @xmath78 in the charge sector .",
    "for example , a correction at cubic order to the result in eq .",
    "( [ pert ] ) is given by @xmath79 we also have a similar correction in @xmath80 .",
    "it would be potentially interesting to observe the logarithmic temperature - dependence of @xmath73 on a given plateau due to kondo spin - flip events .",
    "note also that the perturbation theory in the @xmath68 term has been previously extended to the fourth order.@xcite the perturbative result is valid only far from the degeneracy points provided the renormalization , e.g. , of the spin kondo coupling @xmath81 is also cut - off either by the temperature @xmath64 or by a magnetic field @xmath82 [ in general , for symmetric junctions one already gets @xmath83 at the bare level ; see eq .",
    "this considerably restricts the range of application of this perturbative calculation compared for example to the simpler setup involving a grain coupled to a reservoir and even on a charge plateau the temperature much be larger than the emerging spin kondo energy scale between the lead and the small dot .",
    "finally , note that in our perturbative treatment at finite temperature @xmath76 we have made the ( standard ) approximation : we have only virtually introduced the temperature through the renormalization of the couplings @xmath58 and @xmath68 .",
    "_ the other regimes which requires non - perturbative approaches will be studied in sections iv and v. _",
    "in this section , we will be primarily interested in the situation close to the degeneracy point @xmath78 where none of the perturbative arguments above can be applied .",
    "we want to show that the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) can be mapped onto some generalized kondo hamiltonian following ref .",
    "[ ] .      close to the degeneracy point @xmath78 and for @xmath84 , only the states with @xmath0 and @xmath1 are accessible and higher energy states can be removed from our theory introducing the projectors @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( which project on the states with @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the grain respectively ) .",
    "the truncated hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) then reads : @xmath87}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where now the index @xmath88 indicates the reservoir and @xmath89 indicates the grain .",
    "we have also introduced the small parameter @xmath90 which measures deviations from the degeneracy point .",
    "considering @xmath91 as an abstract _ orbital _",
    "index , the hamiltonian can be rewritten in a more convenient way by introducing another set of pauli matrices for the orbital sector:@xcite @xmath92}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this equation , the operators @xmath93 act on spin and the @xmath94 act on the ( charge ) orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "the key role of this mapping stems from the fact that @xmath73 can be identified as ( an orbital pseudo - spin ) @xmath95 then , we can introduce the extra ( charge ) state @xmath96 as an auxiliary label to the state @xmath97 of the grain .",
    "in addition to introducing the label @xmath96 we make the replacement @xmath98 notice that @xmath99 and @xmath100 are pseudo - spin ladder operators acting only on the charge part @xmath96 .",
    "more precisely , we have the correct identifications @xmath101 meaning that the charge on the single - electron box is adjusted whenever a tunneling process takes place . furthermore , since @xmath102 and @xmath103 these operators",
    "ensure in the same way as the projection operators @xmath85 and @xmath86 that only transitions between states with @xmath0 and @xmath104 take place .",
    "this leads us to identify @xmath105 with the identity operator on the space spanned by @xmath106 and @xmath107 and @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",
    "we now introduce an additional pseudo - spin operator via : @xmath110 where the matrices @xmath111 are standard combinations of pauli matrices .",
    "finally , the coulomb term @xmath112 mimics a magnetic field acting on the orbital space .",
    "therefore , the ( quantum ) grain capacitance @xmath113 is equivalent to the local isospin susceptibility @xmath114 up to a factor @xmath4 . for simplicity , we will substract the classical contribution @xmath20 which is @xmath5-independent .    _ but obviously , to compute the latter , we have to determine the nature of the kondo ground state exactly . _    typically ,",
    "when only `` charge flips '' are involved through the @xmath34 term , the model can be mapped onto a two - channel kondo model ( the two channels correspond to the two spin states of an electron ) , and the capacitance always exhibits a _ logarithmic divergence _ at zero temperature.@xcite here , we have a combination of spin and charge flips .",
    "can we then expect two distinct energy scales for the spin and orbital sectors ? to answer this question , we perform a perturbative scaling analysis following that of a related model in ref . [ ] .",
    "we first rewrite the interacting part of the hamiltonian in real space as : @xmath115 \\\\ \\nonumber & + & q_z t^z\\vec{s}\\cdot \\left(\\psi^{\\dag}{\\tau^z}{\\vec{\\sigma}}\\psi\\right ) + q_{\\perp}\\vec{s}\\cdot \\left[t^+(\\psi^{\\dag}{\\tau^-}{\\vec{\\sigma}}\\psi ) + h.c.\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 .",
    "a host of spin - exchange @xmath117 isospin - exchange interactions are clearly generated ; @xmath33 refers to pure spin - flip processes involving the s=1/2 spin of the small dot , @xmath118 to pure charge flips which modify the grain charge , and @xmath119 describes exotic spin - flip assisted tunneling .",
    "this hamiltonian exhibits a structure which is very similar to the one introduced in ref .",
    "[ ] in order to study a symmetrical double ( small ) quantum dot structure with strong capacitive coupling.@xcite however , since the physical situation that led us to this hamiltonian here is very different from that of ref .",
    "[ ] , our bare values for the coupling parameters are also very different ( for @xmath120 : @xmath121 we have ignored the potential scattering @xmath122 which does not renormalize .",
    "it is also relevant to note that this model belongs to the general class of problems of two coupled kondo impurities .",
    "however the coupling between impurities , namely @xmath119 , is far different from the more usual rkky interaction.@xcite    again , bear in mind that here the operators @xmath123 and @xmath124 project out the grain state with @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and the reservoir / grain electron channels , respectively .",
    "the spin @xmath125 corresponds to the spin of the small dot in the kondo regime and the index @xmath12 is the spin state of an electron in the reservoir or in the grain .",
    "note that in the situation of ref .",
    "[ ] , the operators @xmath126 and @xmath127 rather project out the small double dot states @xmath128 and @xmath129 , and the right / left @xmath130 lead channels , respectively . additionally , the spin @xmath125 is the spin ( excess ) impurity either on the left or the right dot and the index @xmath12 denotes the spin state of electrons in the reservoirs .",
    "the corresponding bare values in that case would be rather of the form : @xmath131      the low - energy hamiltonian can be treated using perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "it is relevant to observe that no new interaction terms are generated to second order as the bandwidth is reduced . by integrating out conduction electrons with energy larger than a scale @xmath132 ( @xmath133 being either the level spacing of the small dot or the charging energy of the grain , i.e. , the ultraviolet cutoff ) , we obtain at second order the following rg equations for the five dimensionless coupling constants : @xmath134 with @xmath135 $ ] being the scaling variable , @xmath136 is the running bandwidth .",
    "this rg analysis is applicable only very close to the degeneracy point @xmath137 where the effective coulomb energy in the grain or @xmath112 vanishes and obviously only when all coupling constants stay @xmath138 .",
    "higher orders in the rg have been neglected .",
    "although the equations ( [ rg ] ) have no simple analytic solution , one can try to read off the essential physics from numerical integration and the initial conditions ( [ couplings ] ) .",
    "let us first discuss the most obvious case of a particle - asymmetric level , with @xmath139 meaning ( large ) @xmath140 .",
    "in this case , the numerical integration of the rg flow indicates that even though we start with completely _",
    "asymmetric _ bare values of the coupling constants , all couplings diverge at the same energy scale due to the presence of the spin - flip assisted tunneling terms @xmath119 and @xmath141 .",
    "this energy scale that we can identify with a generalized kondo temperature is difficult to calculate analytically .",
    "however , we can approximate it by the one of the completely symmetrical model @xmath142 furthermore , we have checked numerically that all coupling ratios converge to one in the low energy limit provided the rg equations can be extrapolated in this regime .",
    "these results have been summarized in figure  2 .",
    "as confirmed below with an exact numerical rg treatment , the entanglement of spin and orbital degrees of freedom in this geometry will lead to an higher symmetry than @xmath143 , namely su(4 ) , and then to the formation of a fermi - liquid correlated ground - state with , e.g. , the complete screening of the orbital spin @xmath144 . [",
    "su(4 ) is the minimal group allowing spin - orbital entanglement and which respects rotational invariance both in spin and orbital spaces . ]",
    "recall that the presence of the spin - flip assisted tunneling terms then definitely hinders the possibility of a non - fermi liquid ground state induced by the over - screening of the the pseudo - impurity @xmath144 .",
    "let us now analyze the particle - hole symmetric case , i.e. , @xmath145 . at second order , the rg flow would tend to suggest that two parameters , namely @xmath118 and @xmath141 remain _ zero _ whatever the energy scale .",
    "typically , the kondo coupling @xmath33 is the largest throughout the rg flow and seems to be the first one to diverge . on the other hand , the ratios @xmath146 and @xmath147",
    "can not be neglected which tends to exclude an @xmath148 symmetry where the spin and the orbital degrees of freedom would be independently screened ( figure 3 ) .",
    "instead , spin - orbital mixing ( entanglement ) seems to be prominent at low - energy . even though the perturbative rg is certainly not sufficient to draw more definitive conclusions , it is also instructive to observe that for @xmath149 , the ratios @xmath147 and @xmath146 still converge to one . since the system definitely has to restore the rotational invariance both in spin and orbital spaces , this tends to emphasize that higher - order terms play a crucial role in the crossover regime eventually by restoring an su(4 ) fermi - liquid even for those cases .",
    "moreover , the rg analysis suggests that the temperature scale at which the fermi - liquid behavior emerge would be much smaller for vanishing and negative @xmath118 because the system needs a much longer time to restore the rotational symmetry both in spin and orbital spaces . to enumerate higher order terms",
    "would be a very tedious task , therefore this assertion will be rather checked by nrg , a completely non perturbative method . to summarize this part",
    ", we emphasize that for @xmath150 , the above perturbative analysis does not allow us to determine the precise nature of the low - temperature fixed point , whether the orbital ( isospin ) moment is exactly screened or over - screened .",
    "we will prove in section [ secnrg ] using nrg , that a su(4 ) strongly - correlated ground state emerges for any physical value of @xmath118 , i.e. , @xmath151 .",
    "this rg analysis suggests  at least for not too small positive @xmath118  that our model becomes equivalent at low energy to an su(4 ) _ symmetrical _ exchange model : @xmath152^a\\psi_{\\nu } \\\\",

    "we have introduced the `` hyper - spin '' @xmath153 for @xmath154 .",
    "the operators @xmath155 can be regarded as the 15 generators of the su(4 ) group .",
    "moreover , this conclusion will be strongly reinforced by the nrg analysis proposed below ( whose range of validity is broader than eqs . ( [ rg ] ) ) which indeed concludes that the effective hamiltonian ( [ irrrep ] ) is appropriate for all values of @xmath156 .",
    "note that apparently ( [ irrrep ] ) has @xmath148 symmetry , representing rotational invariance in both spin and orbital ( pseudo - spin ) spaces , and also interchange symmetry between spin and pseudo - spin .",
    "but , the full symmetry is actually the higher symmetry group su(4 ) , which clearly unifies ( entangles ) the spin of the small dot and the charge degrees of freedom of the metallic grain .",
    "notice that the irreducible representation of su(4 ) written in eq .",
    "( [ irrrep ] ) has been used previously for spin systems with orbital degeneracy.@xcite the electron operator @xmath157 now transforms under the fundamental representation of the su(4 ) group , with generators @xmath158 @xmath159 , and the index @xmath160 labels the four combinations of possible spin @xmath161 and orbital indices @xmath129 , which means @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "the emergence of such a strongly - correlated su(4 ) ground state , characterized by the quenched hyper - spin operator @xmath166 clearly reflects the strong _ entanglement _ between the _ charge _ degrees of freedom of the _ grain _ and the _ spin _ degrees of freedom of the _ small dot _ at low energy induced by the prominence of spin - flip assisted tunneling .",
    "there is the formation of an su(4 ) kondo singlet which is a singlet of the spin operator , the orbital operator , and the orbital - spin mixing operator @xmath167 .",
    "again , let us argue that this enlarged symmetry arises whatever the parameter @xmath118 simply because the spin - flip assisted tunneling term @xmath119 always flows off to strong couplings at the same time than the more usual kondo term @xmath33 ; the system then must inevitably converge to a fixed point with orbital - spin mixing . to respect rotational invariance in both spin and orbital spaces",
    "the only possibility is indeed an su(4)-symmetric kondo model ( as agreed with nrg ) .",
    "the ( one - channel ) su(n ) kondo model has been extensively studied in the literature ( see , e.g. , ref . [ ] ) . in particular",
    ", the strong coupling regime corresponds to a _",
    "dominant _ fermi liquid fixed point induced by the complete screening of the hyper - spin @xmath168 , implying that all the generators of su(4 ) yield a local susceptibility with a behavior in@xcite @xmath169 .",

    "since the asymmetry stands for a marginal perturbation in the rg sense it is natural to argue that the su(4 ) correlated ground state is still robust for weak asymmetry between the tunnel junctions .",
    "but , to obtain more quantitative results we yet resort to nrg ( figure 10 ) . by taking @xmath238 , we can observe that the mixing of spin and orbital degrees of freedom may survive until @xmath239 ; this guarantees an anisotropy of roughly 10@xmath240 between the conductances at the tunnel junctions to preserve the su(4 ) fixed point .",
    "mostly , the magnetic moment @xmath125 and the isospin @xmath144 are simultaneously quenched and again the spectrum can be understood as a sum of four independent chiral fermion spectra with phase shift @xmath200 .",

    "it is worth noting at this stage that the role of the asymmetry parameter @xmath243 seems to be practically equivalent to renormalize the orbital splitting @xmath215 ( compare figures 6 and 11 ) .",
    "the main difference however is that at the degeneracy points of the grain , one can expect a second - stage quenching of the isospin @xmath144 at some lower temperature , but obviously this ( very ) low - temperature regime lies much beyond the range of validity of the effective hamiltonian ( [ hef ] ) .",

    "unfortunately for asymmetric junctions , it is difficult to formulate more quantitative results at low temperatures",
    ". a complete renormalization group calculation starting with the bare hamiltonian ( [ anderson ] ) would be necessary .",
    "this goes beyond the present analysis .",
    "finally , let us mention that for more moderate values of @xmath24 and @xmath28 , i.e. rather in the resonant level regime of the small dot , the nrg results of lebanon _ et al._@xcite still support a two - channel kondo crossover and the ovserscreening of the isospin moment in the case of asymmetric junctions .",
    "we predict that the su(4 ) symmetry should be still robust for wider junctions characterized by @xmath255 transverse channels with almost equal transmission amplitudes , however the associated fermi - liquid typical energy scale decreases exponentially with the number of conducting modes .",
    "for instance , extending results of ref .",
    "[ ] for our geometry , we can clearly assess that there will be a _ unique _ ` effective tunneling mode ' in the lead ( it is some combination of the original tunneling modes in the lead ) and another _ unique _ ` tunneling mode in the box ' ( also a linear combination combination of the original modes in the grain ) : the t=0 effective hamiltonian of the model at the degeneracy points of the metallic dot corresponds to tunneling between these two modes only with or without spin flip of the excess spin of the small dot , and all the other modes can be neglected .",
    "this entirely justifies the emergence of an su(4 ) fixed point at very low temperatures even if the number of modes in the lead or in the grain is larger than one .",

    "we have determined exactly the shape of the steps of the coulomb staircase for a grain coupled to a bulk lead through a small quantum dot in the kondo regime .",
    "first , we mapped the problem onto a related model of two capacitively coupled small quantum dots.@xcite then , combining both nrg calculations with perturbative scaling approaches we have shed light on the possibility of a stable su(4 ) fermi liquid fixed point occurring at the degeneracy points of the grain , where a kondo effect appears    -0.3 cm simultaneously both in the spin and the orbital sectors ; this demands symmetric or slightly asymmetric tunnel junctions and preferably a single - conducting channel with two spin polarizations . more generally , as in ref .",
    "[ ] , these results bring precursory insight on the realization of kondo ground states with su(n ) @xmath260 symmetry at the mesoscopic scale .",
    "let us provide a physical interpretation for the occurrence of such an su(4 ) entanglement .",
    "typically , close to the degeneracy points of the grain , we have two spin objects , namely the spin @xmath125 of the small dot and the orbital pseudo - spin @xmath144 of the grain depicting the two allowed degenerate charging states . obviously , when these two spin objects are uncoupled the symmetry group of the problem is unambiguously @xmath143 .",
    "but , as already discussed at length in the sequel , in our setting spin - flip assisted tunneling events  i.e. , an electron from the bulk lead tunnels onto the metallic grain by flipping the excess spin of the small dot and vice - versa  are very prominent at low energy ; this implies that the infra - red fixed point must also reflect a visible spin - orbital mixing .",
    "_ finally , it is easy to check that su(4 ) is the minimal group allowing spin - orbital entanglement and which guarantees rotational invariance both in spin and orbital spaces_. our kondo fixed point then is rather described by the quenching of the hyper - spin @xmath261 [ \\vec{\\hbox{t}}+{1\\over 2}]$ ] .    in a very different context ,",
    "let us mention that su(4 ) singlets have also shown up in fermion lattice models where spin and orbital degrees of freedom play a very symmetric role.@xcite    the major consequence of this enlarged symmetry is that the ground state is fermi - liquid like , which considerably smears out the coulomb staircase behavior already in the weak tunneling region , and in particular , hinders the matveev logarithmic singularity@xcite to take place ( figure 12 ) .",
    "the grain capacitance exhibits instead of a logarithmic singularity , a strongly reduced peak as a function of the back - gate voltage .",
    "_ this stands for an irrefutable signature of the formation of a fermi - liquid ground state when tunneling through a single - electron box .",
    "_ furthermore , we mightily emphasize that our nrg calculations markedly reproduce an su(4 ) ground state regardless of the particle - hole asymmetry onto the small dot ( figure 4 ) ; more precisely , even in the case of particle - hole symmetry @xmath42 , the spectrum can be still interpreted as a sum of four independent chiral fermions with phase shift @xmath200 in agreement with the su(4 ) fermi liquid theory .",
    "this differs from the conclusion of ref .",
    "[ ] . however , this is not so surprising in the sense that in their nrg calculations ( see , e.g. , their figures 15 and 16 ) , lebanon _ et al . _",
    "have studied a rather different limit , @xmath262 but @xmath263 , which does not correspond to our situation of a small dot and a much larger metallic grain @xmath264 . besides , in the case of symmetric barriers , they clearly noticed that a moderate coulomb repulsion on the small dot already pushes the two - channel kondo regime down to much lower temperature .",
    "it is also worth to recall that the associated kondo temperature scale @xmath2 can be strongly enhanced compared to that of the matveev s original setup which maybe ensures the verification of our predictions .",

    "so far , we have concentrated on the situation at and near the degeneracy points of the grain .",
    "let us now apply a quite strong orbital magnetic field such that we move explicitly away from the degeneracy points .",

    "more precisely , following glazman and raikh,@xcite only the even linear combination of the electron creation and annihilation operators in the two bulk leads couples to the local site ( small dot ) . the odd linear combination can be omitted and conceptually the effective model could be rewritten as in eq .",

    "<S> we emphasize that for symmetric and slightly asymmetric barriers , the strong entanglement of charge and spin flip events in this setup inevitably results in a non trivial stable su(4 ) kondo fixed point near the degeneracy points of the grain . by analogy with a small dot sandwiched between two leads , the ground state is fermi - liquid like which considerably smears out the coulomb staircase behavior and hampers the matveev logarithmic singularity to arise . </S>",
    "<S> most notably , the associated kondo temperature @xmath2 might be raised compared to that in the conductance experiments through a small quantum dot @xmath3 which makes the observation of our predictions _ a priori _ accessible . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the robustness of the su(4 ) correlated state against the inclusion of an external magnetic field , a deviation from the degeneracy points , particle - hole symmetry in the small dot , asymmetric tunnel junctions and comment on the different crossovers . </S>"
