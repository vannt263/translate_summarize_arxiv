    "it is well - known that high frequency vibrations of a tank containing a fluid with free surface or two superimposed immiscible fluids can lead to very interesting and non - trivial effects .",
    "for example , the rayleigh - taylor instability of two superimposed fluids ( with the heavier fluid on top of the lighter one ) can be suppressed by vertical vibrations , and horizontal vibrations of the tank may lead to quasi - stationary finite - amplitude waves on the interface ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we consider an infinite horizontal fluid layer of finite depth which is subject to high - frequency vertical vibrations .",
    "it is known that , under certain conditions , the dynamics of a periodically forced system can be described as a superposition of a fast oscillatory motion and a slowly varying averaged motion . in this case , it is possible to obtain averaged equations describing this slow evolution by employing a suitable averaging procedure ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "` slow ' means that the characteristic time scale for these waves is much longer than the period of vibrations , i.e. @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the vibration frequency , @xmath2 in the mean fluid depth and @xmath3 is the gravitational acceleration .    for the flow regimes considered here to be observable , one needs to make sure that there is no parametric instability leading to generation of faraday waves ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the theory developed below works in the limit of very high vibration frequency ( much higher than the frequency range where the parametric instability usually occurs ) .",
    "so , it will be assumed throughout the paper that either there is no parametric instability for some given values of the amplitude and frequency of the vibration or the instability is suppressed by some other factor ( e.g. by viscosity ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive and analyse nonlinear shallow water equations that describe slowly varying long waves on the surface of a vertically vibrating layer of an inviscid fluid .",
    "similar , but more general , equations without long wave approximation had been derived earlier by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "somewhat similar averaged equations had also been obtained for more complicated systems , which involve not only a free surface , but also some additional physical effects , such as marangoni effect ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) or van der waals forces between a rigid substrate and a liquid film @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the pure effect of the vibration on free - surface flows . to make this effect as transparent as possible",
    ", we will consider the simplest problem and completely ignore compressibility , viscosity and surface tension .",
    "as far as we are aware , long - wave asymptotic behaviour of a vibrating fluid layer in this simple situation has not been considered before .",
    "let s briefly discuss whether this simple problem can still be relevant for real flows .",
    "the assumption that sound waves can be ignored means that the typical hydrodynamic velocity is much smaller than the speed of sound @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath5 the viscosity can be dropped if the viscous time scale is much greater than the typical period of the waves , i.e. @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid . note that ( [ 0.1 ] ) and ( [ 0.3 ] ) imply that the thickness of viscous boundary layers is much less than the fluid depth : @xmath8 . combining ( [ 0.1 ] ) and ( [ 0.2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath9 for water layer of depth @xmath10 cm , this is equivalent to @xmath11 , which gives us quite a wide range of @xmath1 ( say , from @xmath12 to @xmath13 ) .",
    "as was mentioned earlier , the effects of surface tension will not be considered for simplicity ( these effects can easily be taken into account later if necessary ) .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption provided that the bond number , defined as @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the fluid density , @xmath16 the typical wavelength and @xmath17 the surface tension ) , is sufficiently large . for the water - air interface and the wavelength of @xmath10 cm , the bond number is quite large ( @xmath18 ) , so that the surface tension can be safely dropped .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 contains the formulation of the mathematical problem . in section 3 , we derive a general averaged model without the long - wave approximation ( although similar equations had been derived earlier by @xcite and @xcite , we include this case for the sake of completeness and because our approach is different from that of the above papers ) .",
    "the asymptotic equations are hamiltonian , and the dispersion relation for small amplitude waves suggests that the effect of the vibration is similar to that of surface tension . in section 4 ,",
    "we derive two long - wave asymptotic models : for the vibration amplitude much smaller than the fluid depth and for the vibration amplitude of the same order as the fluid depth .",
