    "optical bistability ( ob ) occurs when a nonlinear dielectric is placed inside of optical resonator , which provides a feedback mechanism for the light .",
    "the output intensity from the resonator can , as a result , have two or more stable values for a given input intensity that is driving the cavity and can be made to switch between these two outputs by varying the input intensity beyond the bistable region@xcite .",
    "the interest in ob systems started in the 1960 s with @xmath0 et al theory of absorptive optical bistability where the bistability is a result of absorption by the dielectric medium@xcite .",
    "ob was first observed experimentally and explained by gibbs _",
    "@xcite for a cavity containing a medium with a nonlinear index of refraction and no absorption or gain ( dispersive bistability ) .",
    "interest in ob has been stimulated by its practical applications including optical switches , logic gates , and optically bistable memory devices@xcite .",
    "in addition to device applications , ob is also interesting because it exhibits novel physical behavior such as phase transitions between stationary but non - equilibrium states@xcite .    in a completely independent development ,",
    "spintronics has emerged as new field in which the spin degrees of freedom of charge carriers in solid state devices are exploited for the purpose of information processing .",
    "manipulation of the spin degrees of freedom rather than the charge has the advantage of longer coherence and relaxation times @xcite . in order to manipulate the spin degree of freedom for the purpose of information processing",
    ", there is a demand for efficient and readily fabricated spin devices such as spin batteries , spin filters , spin transistors , etc .. much of this work has focused on ways to generate pure spin currents in semiconductor nanostructures using , for example , the extrinsic spin - orbit ( so ) interaction @xcite , rashba so interactions @xcite , optical absorption @xcite , raman scattering @xcite , shape deformations of open quantum dots @xcite , as well as various types of quantum pumps @xcite .",
