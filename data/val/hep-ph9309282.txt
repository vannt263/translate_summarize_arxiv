    "the explicit quark picture of hadrons has been investigated by an increasing number of models using effective , constituent quarks as the fundamental degrees of freedom  @xcite . despite the fact that a formal link is missing between such qcd inspired models and exact qcd there are many indications that the constituent quark representation does emerge as a result of strong vacuum correlations similar to those leading to chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "central to these approaches is a globally gauge invariant potential confining the quarks .",
    "justification for an effective potential is provided by the flux tube configurations generated by the gluon field . to be realistic",
    ", these models must also incorporate relativity  @xcite due to the large velocities associated with quarks having masses of the order of few hundred mev but bound on a typical hadronic scale of the order of a @xmath1 .",
    "the problem of formulating relativistic dynamics for a fixed number of particles originated with the pioneering work of dirac  @xcite and has been extensively studied over the years on both classical and quantum levels .",
    "classically this is a cauchy problem to determine the world lines in minkowski space , while in the quantum case one seeks the probability amplitude distributions , as an initial value problem on a 3-dimensional spacelike or lightlike surface .",
    "we refer the reader to the extensive literature on the subject  @xcite .",
    "the possible choices of the initial surface are commonly classified according to the dimension of the corresponding stability group consisting of purely kinematical transformations within the subspace defined by the initial conditions . conveniently , the group representation does not require a full solution of the evolution equations . with this classification scheme",
    "the surface of the light cone , also referred to as the light front , is very appealing because it generates the largest stability group . at the field theoretic level",
    "there are also practical reasons for quantizing on the light front  @xcite . at short distances color interactions",
    "can be treated perturbatively and such separations , which are lightlike in a minkowski metric , usually dominate high energy processes  @xcite .",
    "further , the qcd vacuum is rigorously decoupled from excited fock states when formulated on the light cone and this permits a more sensible quark fock state expansion for hadron states  @xcite . however , until a formal connection is established between field theory and qcd inspired models , such arguments should cautiously be regarded .",
    "a major deficiency of all formalism choosing a fixed quantization surface , including the light cone , is the lack of complete lorentz covariance .",
    "formalisms using a specific quantization surface defined by a fixed vector @xmath2 introduce an incorrect functional dependence for all physical observables , e.g. form factors , upon @xmath2 . a covariant wave function that describes a system of @xmath3 particles depends on @xmath3 independent _ time _ variables , @xmath4 , which in turn requires specifying the full dynamics by prescribing the action of @xmath3 hamiltonians on the initial wave function spanning a @xmath5 dimensional surface @xmath6",
    "@xcite , @xmath7 if full covariance is important or desired , the dynamical evolution of a system must be independent from the choice of quantization surface . as a consequence",
    ", there is no preferred quantization scheme nor can one classify different choices by the size of the corresponding stability group .",
    "of course full covariance is not always necessary , provided strong arguments exist for disposing of unphysical degrees of freedom or spurious form factors arising in a noncovariant formulation  @xcite",
    ". in general , however , it will be important to identify the relevant degrees of freedom in a framework independent way .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to compare relativistic calculations of observables for pseudoscalar mesons , for which the constituent quark structure is well established , using both noncovariant and covariant schemes and to document framework sensitivity .    in the following section the basic assumptions underling the quark model calculation of physical observables are reviewed .",

    "requires a strange quark mass of about @xmath217 , however , the @xmath218 charge radius is then too small , @xmath219 as compared to @xmath220 experimentally . similarly the pion decay constant is problematic in the instant model since it is predominantly independent of the quark mass and to correctly model requires a @xmath79 value which yields an unphysically small charge radius . for additional insight",

    "the two curves establish the maximum variation of the form factor as a function of @xmath203 and correspond to the two extremes , @xmath181 ( solid line ) and @xmath229 ( dashed line ) ( @xmath230 ) .",
    "notice that in this @xmath223 region the form factor is extremely insensitive to @xmath203 , i.e. the choice of the quantization surface .",
    "we have developed a covariant approach for investigating hadronic structure involving hadronic matrix elements of constituent quark operators .",
    "the model incorporates all relevant symmetries , lorentz and gauge by construction and permits assessing the sensitivity of computed observables to the choice in quantization scheme ( parameter @xmath203 ) . as such our method",
    "can be regarded as a covariant criteria since it can be implemented in any quark model to detail sensitivity to front orientation .",
    "a large sensitivity indicates the need for full covariance and perhaps a more sophisticated hadronic model .",
    "we have also calculated various mesonic properties in this model and compared the results with previous but noncovariant schemes .",
    "key findings are that relativity is crucial but that relativistic approaches which properly treat wigner spin rotations and appropriate ansatzs for the relative , spin - independent wave function ( dependence not directly on @xmath160 but through @xmath161 instead ) , can achieve equivalent phenomenological descriptions at least for the present quality of data .",
    "in particular we have found that a proper relativistic quark model with a soft ( gaussian ) wave function can account for most of the normalization of the electromagnetic form factors at intermediate @xmath223 .",
    "this is in agreement with many recent findings  @xcite and indicates that the region where the perturbative qcd becomes dominant may be shifted to momentum transfers as large as @xmath231 . as more precise data becomes available it may be possible to distinguish alternative formulations including additional degrees of freedom such as effective gluonic excitations and/or exotic quark configurations , as in principle expected in qcd .",
    "our approach can be easily extended to address these new degrees of freedom to again assess the importance of covariance in a model independent way .    as .",
