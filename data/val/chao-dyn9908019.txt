    "in the `` old '' quantum theory developed around the turn of the century , quantization of a mechanical system used to be based on its classical behavior . in 1917 , einstein @xcite was able to formulate the quantization conditions found by bohr and sommerfeld in their most general form .",
    "at the same time , however , einstein pointed out that they were applicable only to systems whose classical phase space was foliated into invariant tori , i.e. , which possess sufficiently many constants of motion , and that most mechanical systems do not meet this requirement .",
    "the development of quantum mechanics by schrdinger , heisenberg and others then offered techniques which allowed for a precise description of atomic systems without recourse to classical mechanics .",
    "thus , the problem of quantizing chaotic mechanical systems on the basis of their classical behavior remained open .",
    "as late as in the 1960s , gutzwiller returned to what is now known as a semiclassical treatment of quantum systems .",
    "starting from feynman s path integral formulation of quantum mechanics , he derived a semiclassical approximation to the green s function of a quantum system which he then used to evaluate the density of states . his _ trace formula _",
    "@xcite is the only general tool known today for a semiclassical understanding of systems whose classical counterparts exhibit chaotic behavior .",
    "it represents the quantum density of states as a sum of a smooth average part and fluctuations arising from all periodic orbits of the classical system , and therefore allows structures in the quantum spectrum to be interpreted in terms of classical mechanics .",
    "the derivation of the trace formula assumes all periodic orbits of the system to be isolated .",
    "thus , it is most appropriate for a description of completely hyperbolic system , where in some cases it even allows for a semiclassical determination of individual energy levels , as was done , e.g. , by gutzwiller in the case of the anisotropic kepler problem @xcite . in generic hamiltonian systems exhibiting mixed regular - chaotic dynamics , however , bifurcations of periodic orbits can occur .",
    "they cause the trace formula to diverge because close to a bifurcation the periodic orbits involved approach each other arbitrarily closely .",
    "this failure can be overcome if all periodic orbits involved in a bifurcation are treated collectively . a first step in this direction",
    "was taken by ozorio de almeida and hannay @xcite who proposed formulas for the collective contributions which yield finite results at the bifurcation energy but do not correctly reproduce the results of gutzwiller s trace formula as the distance from the bifurcation increases .",
    "similarly , peters , jaff and delos @xcite were able to deal with bifurcations of closed orbits arising in the context of the closed - orbit theory of atomic photoionization . to improve these results , sieber and schomerus @xcite",
    "recently derived uniform approximations which interpolate smoothly between gutzwiller s isolated - orbits contributions on either side of the bifurcation .",
    "their formulas are applicable to all kinds of period-@xmath0-tupling bifurcation generic to hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom .",
    "a closer inspection of bifurcation scenarios encountered in practical applications of semiclassical quantization reveals , however , that the uniform approximations applicable to generic codimension - one bifurcations need to be extended to also include bifurcations of higher codimension .",
    "although these non - generic bifurcations can not directly be observed if only a single control parameter is varied , they can nevertheless produce clear signatures in semiclassical spectra because in their neighborhood two codimension - one bifurcations approach each other , so that all periodic orbits involved in any of the subsequent bifurcations have to be treated collectively .",
    "examples of this situation were studied by schomerus and haake @xcite as well as by main and wunner @xcite , who applied techniques of catastrophe theory to achieve a collective treatment of complicated bifurcation scenarios .",
    "all uniform approximations discussed so far in the literature require the inclusion of complex `` ghost orbits '' . at a bifurcation point ,",
    "new real periodic orbits are born .",
    "if , in the energy range where the real orbits do not exist , the search for periodic orbits is extended to the complexified phase space , the orbits about to be born can be found to possess complex predecessors  ghost orbits . as was first shown by ku et .",
    "@xcite , some of these ghost orbits , whose contributions become exponentially small in the limit of @xmath1 , have to be included in gutzwiller s trace formula .",
    "in addition , the construction of uniform approximations requires complete information about the bifurcation scenario , including ghost orbits .",
    "all bifurcation scenarios discussed in the physics literature so far involved bifurcations of real orbits only .",
    "however , there is no reason why ghost orbits should not themselves undergo bifurcations in their process of turning real .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to demonstrate that ghost orbit bifurcations do indeed occur and have a pronounced effect on semiclassical spectra if they arise as part of a bifurcation scenario of higher codimension . to this end",
    ", we present an example taken from the diamagnetic kepler problem .",
    "the example we chose appears to be simple : we discuss the period - quadrupling of the balloon orbit , which is one of the shortest periodic orbits in the diamagnetic kepler problem .",
    "however , even this simple case turns out to require the inclusion of a ghost orbit bifurcation .    to cope with this new situation",
    ", we have to develop a technique which enables us to deal with the occurence of ghost orbits .",
    "it turns out that normal form theory allows for a description of real and ghost orbit bifurcations on an equal footing .",
    "consequently , ghost orbit bifurcations are found to contribute to uniform approximations in much the same way as bifurcations of real orbits do , provided that they occur in connection to bifurcations of real orbits as part of a bifurcation scenario of higher codimension .",
    "therefore , we will arive at the conclusion that in generic hamiltonian systems with mixed regular - chaotic dynamics the occurence of ghost orbit bifurcations will not be a very exotic , but rather quite a common phenomenon .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , we briefly summarize the derivation of gutzwiller s trace formula , which forms the basis of semiclassical theories of the density of states .",
    "section 3 presents the bifurcation scenario of the example chosen . in section 4",
    ", we discuss normal form theory and show that it allows for an analytic description of the example bifurcation scenario .",
    "section 5 then contains the uniform approximation pertinent to the example scenario .",
    "it is evaluated in two different degrees of approximation , one of which asymptotically yields perfect agreement with the results of gutzwiller s trace formula .",
    "a more concise presentation of our main results can be found in @xcite .",
    "gutzwiller s trace formula offers a way to calculate a semiclassical approximation to the quantum mechanical density of states @xmath2 where the sum extends over all quantum eigenenergies @xmath3 of the system under study . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the density of states is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and the green s function @xmath6 is the configuration space representation of the resolvent operator @xmath7 on the other hand , it is connected to the time - domain propagator @xmath8 by a fourier transform @xmath9 thus , if feynman s path integral representation of the propagator @xmath10 and the fourier integral are approximately evaluated by the method of stationary phase , one obtains the semiclassical green s function ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) @xmath11 here , the sum extends over all classical trajectories connecting @xmath12 to @xmath13 at energy @xmath14 , @xmath15 denotes the classical action along the trajectory , @xmath16           { \\frac{\\partial^2s}{\\partiale\\partial{{\\bf x } } } } & { \\frac{\\partial^2s}{\\partial e^2 } }         \\end{pmatrix } \\;,\\ ] ] and the integer @xmath17 counts the number of caustics the trajectory touches .    to find the density of states , one has to calculate the trace of the semiclassical green s function . to this end",
    ", one calculates the limit of @xmath18 for @xmath19 and then integrate over @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath13 is very close to @xmath12 , there always exists a direct path connecting @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , there are usually indirect paths which leave the neighborhood of their starting point before returning there .",
    "the contribution of the direct path can be shown to yield _",
    "weyl s density of states _",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes heaviside s step function .",
    "this result reproduces the well - known fact from statistical mechanics that on the average there is one quantum state per phase space volume of @xmath22 .",
    "the contributions of indirect paths then superimpose system - specific modulations on this general average value .    due to the stationary - phase condition",
    ", only periodic orbits contribute to the semiclassical density of states . to determine the contribution of a single periodic orbit ,",
    "one introduces a coordinate system with one coordinate running along the periodic orbit and all other coordinates perpendicular to it . assuming all periodic orbits to be isolated in phase space",
    ", one can then evaluate the trace by the method of stationary phase and obtains _",
    "gutzwiller s trace formula _ for the system - specific modulations of the density of states @xmath23 here , the sum runs over all periodic orbits at energy @xmath14 , @xmath24 denotes the action of the orbit , @xmath25 its primitive period , @xmath26 its monodromy matrix , which describes the stability of the orbit , and @xmath27 its maslov index , which reflects the topology of nearby orbits . in the derivation",
    ", the primitive period @xmath25 can be seen to arise from the integration along the orbit , whereas the occurrence of the monodromy matrix is due to the integrations over the transverse coordinates .",
    "gutzwiller s trace formula expresses the quantum density of states in terms of purely classical data .",
    "it fails , however , if the periodic orbits of the classical system can not be regarded as isolated , as is the case , e.g. , close to a bifurcation .",
    "there , the failure of the trace formula manifests itself in a divergence of the isolated - orbits contributions in ( [ spurf ] ) : if an orbit undergoes a bifurcation , the determinant of @xmath28 vanishes . in recent years",
    ", the problem of calculating the joint contribution of bifurcating orbits to the density of states was addressed by various authors , whose works were briefly reviewed in the introduction .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to present normal form theory as a technique which allows one to achieve a _ collective _ description of bifurcating orbits and to show its applicability to a complicated bifurcation scenario .",
    "in particular , we shall demonstrate that bifurcations of ghost orbits need to be included in the description of classical bifurcation scenarios because they can exert a marked influence on semiclassical spectra , and that classical normal form theory can be extended so as to meet this requirement .",
    "however , before we come to deal with the construction of uniform approximations in sections [ nfbifsec ] and [ uniflsgsec ] , we shall give a description of our example system , the diamagnetic kepler problem , and the bifurcation scenario we are going to study .",
    "as a prototype example of a system which undergoes a transition to chaos , we shall investigate the hydrogen atom in a homogeneous external magnetic field , which is reviewed , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "we assume the nucleus fixed and regard the electron as a structureless point charge moving under the combined influences of the electrostatic coulomb force and the lorentz force . throughout this paper",
    ", we shall use atomic units , let the magnetic field point along the @xmath29-direction and denote its strength by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the atomic unit of the magnetic field strength .",
    "the hamiltonian then reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denotes the @xmath29-component of the angular momentum . in the following",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the case @xmath35 . as a consequence ,",
    "the angular coordinate @xmath36 measuring rotation around the field axis becomes ignorable , so that we are effectively dealing with a two - degree - of - freedom system .",
    "the energy @xmath37 is a constant of motion .",
    "thus , the dynamics depends on both the energy and the magnetic field strength as control parameters .",
    "this situation can be simplified , however , if one exploits the scaling properties of the hamiltonian . if classical quantities are scaled according to @xmath38 one obtains the scaled hamiltonian @xmath39 the scaled dynamics depends on the scaled energy as its only control parameter .",
    "the equations of motion following from this hamiltonian are difficult to handle numerically due to the coulomb singularity at @xmath40 . to overcome this problem , one introduces _",
    "semiparabolical coordinates _ @xmath41 and a new orbital parameter @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 these transformations lead to the final form of the hamiltonian @xmath44 in this form , the scaled energy @xmath45 plays the rle of an external parameter , whereas the value of the hamiltonian is fixed : it has to be chosen equal to 2 .",
    "the equations of motion following from this hamiltonian do not contain singularities any more so that they can easily be integrated numerically .",
    "note that the definition ( [ spkoord ] ) determines the semiparabolical coordinates up to a choice of sign only .",
    "thus , orbits which are mirror images of each other with respect to a reflection at the @xmath17- or @xmath27-axes have to be identified . furthermore ,",
    "if we follow a periodic orbit until it closes in @xmath46-coordinates , this may correspond to more than one period in the original configuration space .",
    "this has to be kept in mind when interpreting plots of periodic orbits in semiparabolical coordinates .    as a substantial extension of the classical description of the diamagnetic kepler problem we complexify the classical phase space by allowing coordinates and momenta to assume complex values .",
    "as the hamiltonian ( [ reghamfkt ] ) is holomorphic , we can at the same time regard the phase space trajectories as functions of complex times @xmath42 . to numerically calculate the solution of the equations of motion at a given time @xmath47",
    ", we integrate the equations of motion along a path connecting the origin of the complex @xmath42-plane to the desired endpoint @xmath47 . by cauchy",
    "s integral theorem , the result does not depend on the path chosen so that we can safely choose to integrate along a straight line from @xmath48 to @xmath47 .",
    "this extension allows us to look for ghost orbit predecessors of real periodic orbits born in a bifurcation . in general , their orbital parameters @xmath24 , @xmath49 and the monodromy matrix @xmath26 will be complex . we calculate them along with the numerical integration of the equations of motion from @xmath50      the diamagnetic kepler problem described by the hamiltonian ( [ reghamfkt ] ) exhibits a transition between regular dynamics at strongly negative scaled energies @xmath51 and chaotic dynamics at @xmath52 and above ( for details see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "correspondingly , there are only three different periodic orbits at very low scaled energy , whereas the number of periodic orbits increases exponentially as @xmath53 .    at",
    "any fixed scaled energy , there is a periodic orbit parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "it is purely coulombic since a motion parallel to the magnetic field does not cause a lorentz force .",
    "this orbit is stable at low negative scaled energies ; as @xmath53 , however , it turns unstable and stable again infinitely often @xcite .",
    "for the first time , instability occurs at @xmath54 . in this bifurcation , a stable and an unstable periodic orbit",
    "the stable orbit is known as the _ balloon orbit_. it is depicted in figure [ balabb ] . as shown in bifurcation theory ,",
    "the stability of a periodic orbit is determinded by the trace of its monodromy matrix .",
    "for the balloon orbit , the trace is shown in figure [ spurabb ] .",
    "it equals 2 when the orbit is born . as the scaled energy increases ,",
    "the trace decreases monotonically .",
    "the orbit turns unstable at @xmath55 , where the trace equals @xmath56 . in between ,",
    "all kinds of period-@xmath0-tupling bifurcations occur . in this work",
    ", we shall discuss the period - quadrupling bifurcation which arises at the zero of the trace at @xmath57 .",
    "for @xmath58 , two real satellite orbits of quadruple period exist .",
    "they are depicted in figure [ reellabb ] at two different values of the scaled energy .",
    "the solid and dashed curves in the plots represent the stable and unstable satellite orbits , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the balloon orbit is shown for comparison as a dotted curve .",
    "the satellites can clearly be seen to approach the balloon orbit as @xmath59 . at @xmath60 , they collide with the balloon orbit and disappear .",
    "below @xmath60 , a stable and an unstable ghost satellite exist instead .",
    "they are presented as the solid and dotted curves in figure [ kplx343 ] .",
    "note that the imaginary parts are small compared to the real parts because the bifurcation where the imaginary parts vanish is close . as the hamiltonian ( [ reghamfkt ] ) is real ,",
    "the complex conjugate of any orbit is again a solution of the equations of motion . in this case , however , the ghost satellites coincide with their complex conjugates , so that the total number of orbits is conserved in the bifurcation .",
    "this behavior can be understood in terms of normal form theory ( see section [ genbifsec ] ) .",
    "the orbits described so far form a generic kind of period - quadrupling bifurcation as described by meyer @xcite and dealt with in the context of semiclassical quantization by sieber and schomerus @xcite . in our case , however , this description of the bifurcation scenario is not yet complete because there exists an additional periodic ghost orbit at scaled energies around @xmath60 .",
    "its shape is shown as a dashed curve in figure [ kplx343 ] .",
    "it is very similar to the stable ghost satellite originating in the period - quadrupling , and indeed , when following the ghost orbits to lower energies , we find another bifurcation at @xmath61 , i.e. , only slightly below the bifurcation point @xmath62 of the period - quadrupling . at @xmath63 ,",
    "the additional ghost orbit collides with the stable ghost satellite , and these two orbits turn into a pair of complex conjugate ghost orbits .",
    "their shapes are presented at a scaled energy of @xmath64 as the solid and dashed curves in figure [ kplx344 ] .",
    "from the imaginary parts , the loss of conjugation symmetry can clearly be seen if the symmetries of the semiparabolical coordinate system as described above are taken into account .",
    "the dotted curve in figure [ kplx344 ] represents the unstable ghost satellite which was already present at @xmath65 .",
    "it does not undergo any further bifurcations .",
    "note that the second bifurcation at @xmath66 involves ghost orbits only .",
    "this kind of bifurcation has not yet been described in the literature so far .",
    "in particular , meyer s classification of codimension - one bifurcations in generic hamiltonian systems covers bifurcations of real orbits only and does not include bifurcations of ghost orbits .",
    "consequently , the influence of ghost orbit bifurcations on semiclassical spectra has never been investigated so far . due to the existence of this bifurcation , however , the results by sieber and schomerus @xcite concerning generic period - quadrupling bifurcations can not be applied to the complicated bifurcation scenario described here . as in cases dealt with before by main and wunner @xcite as well as by schomerus and haake @xcite , who discussed the semiclassical treatment of two neighboring bifurcations of real orbits , the closeness of the two bifurcations requires the construction of a uniform approximation taking into account all orbits involved in either bifurcation collectively .",
    "thus , the ghost orbit bifurcation at @xmath63 turns out to contribute to the semiclassical spectrum in much the same way as a bifurcation of real orbits does , as long as we do not go to the extreme semiclassical domain where the two bifurcations can be regarded as isolated and ghost orbit contributions vanish altogether .    to construct a uniform approximation",
    ", we need to know the periodic orbit parameters of all orbits involved in the bifurcations .",
    "the parameters were calculated numerically and are displayed in figure [ datafig ] as functions of the scaled energy .",
    "part ( a ) of this figure presents the actions of the orbits . to exhibit the sequence of bifurcations",
    "more clearly , the action of four repetitions of the central balloon orbit was chosen as a reference level @xmath67 . around @xmath60 , we recognize two almost parabolic curves which indicate the actions of the stable ( upper curve ) and unstable ( lower curve ) satellite orbits . at @xmath60 ,",
    "the curves change from solid to dashed as the satellite orbits become complex .",
    "another dashed line represents the action of the additional ghost orbit , which can clearly be seen not to collide with the balloon orbit at @xmath60 .",
    "whereas the unstable ghost satellite does not undergo any further bifurcations , the curves representing the stable and the additional ghost orbits can be seen to join at @xmath68 .",
    "below @xmath63 , a dotted curve indicates the presence of a pair of complex conjugate ghosts .",
    "the imaginary parts of their actions are different from zero and have opposite signs , whereas above @xmath69 , all ghost orbits coincide with their complex conjugates so that their actions are real .",
    "analogously , part ( b ) of figure [ datafig ] presents the orbital periods . in this case",
    ", no differences were taken , so that the period of the fourth repetition of the balloon orbit , which is always real , appears in the figure as a nearly horizontal line at @xmath70 .",
    "the other orbits can be identified with the help of the bifurcations they undergo , similar to the discussion of the actions given above .",
    "finally , figure [ datafig](c ) shows the traces of the monodromy matrices minus two . for hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom ,",
    "these quantities agree with @xmath71 . at @xmath60 and @xmath63 ,",
    "they can be seen to vanish for the bifurcating orbits , thus causing the periodic orbit amplitudes ( [ spurf ] ) to diverge at the bifurcation points .",
    "as we have seen , gutzwiller s trace formula ( [ spurf ] ) fails close to bifurcations , when periodic orbits of the classical system can not be regarded as isolated . to overcome this difficulty , we need a technique which allows us to describe the structure of the classical phase space close to a bifurcating orbit",
    "this can be done with the help of normal form theory .",
    "a detailed description of this technique can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix 7 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 2.5 and 4.2 ) . here",
    ", we will present the normal form transformations for systems with two degrees of freedom only , although the general scheme is the same for higher dimensional cases . as only stable periodic orbits",
    "can undergo bifurcations , we will restrict ourselves to this case .    as a first step",
    ", we introduce a special canonical coordinate system @xmath72 in a neighborhood of a periodic orbit , which has the following properties ( concerning the existence of such a coordinate system , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7.4 , proposition 1 ) ) :    * @xmath73 is measured along the periodic orbit and @xmath74 perpedicular to it , so that phase space points lying on the periodic orbit are characterized by @xmath75 .",
    "* @xmath73 assumes values between 0 and @xmath76 , and along the periodic orbit we have , up to a constant , @xmath77 where @xmath49 denotes the orbital period . *",
    "if we choose an initial condition in the neighborhood and @xmath78 , the function @xmath79 is invertible .    according to the last condition",
    ", we can regard @xmath80 and @xmath74 as functions of @xmath73 instead of @xmath81 .",
    "the classical dynamics of a mechanical system is given by hamilton s variational principle , which states that a classical trajectory with fixed initial and final coordinates @xmath82 and @xmath83 satisfies @xmath84 if we restrict ourselves to considering the energy surface given by a fixed energy @xmath14 , we can transform the integral as follows : @xmath85 the last term in this expression is a constant which does not contribute to the variation of the integral , so that actual orbits of the system satisfy @xmath86 thus , the dependence of @xmath80 and @xmath74 on the new parameter @xmath73 is given by hamilton s equations of motion , where @xmath87 plays the rle of the hamiltonian .",
    "it has to be determined as a function of the new phase space coordinates @xmath88 , the `` time '' @xmath73 and the energy @xmath14 , which occurs as a parameter , from the equation @xmath89 from our choice of the coordinate system , @xmath90 is periodic in @xmath73 with a period of @xmath76 .",
    "we have now reduced the dynamics of a two - degrees - of - freedom autonomous hamiltonian system to that of a single - degree - of - freedom system , which is , however , no longer autonomous , but periodically time - dependent . with regard to the original system",

    "therefore , we can successively eliminate terms of ever higher order without destroying the simplifications once achieved in later steps .",
    "of course , the generating function ( [ ordkerz ] ) must not contain terms that make the denominator in ( [ ordkkoeff ] ) vanish .",

    "we denote it by @xmath277 : @xmath278 finally , we obtain the contribution of the orbits under study to the density of states : @xmath279    the exponent function @xmath280 has to be related to known functions .",
    "the only information on @xmath281 we possess is the distribution of its stationary points : they correspond to classical periodic orbits .",
    "the classification of real - valued functions with respect to the distribution of their stationary points is achieved within the mathematical framework of _ catastrophe theory _ @xcite .",
    "the object of study there are families of functions @xmath282 depending on @xmath105 so - called _ state variables _ @xmath12 and indexed by @xmath283 _ control variables _ @xmath101 . for any fixed control @xmath101 , the function @xmath284 is assumed to have a stationary point at the origin and to take 0 as its stationary value there .",
    "further stationary points may or may not exist in a neighborhood of the origin . as the control parameters are varied , such additional stationary points may collide with the central stationary point , they may be born or destroyed . the aim of catastrophe theory is to qualitatively understand how these bifurcations of stationary points can take place .",
    "more precisely , two families @xmath285 and @xmath286 of functions as described above are regarded as eqivalent if there is a diffeomorphism @xmath287 of control space and a control - dependent family @xmath288 of diffeomorphisms of state space which keep the origin fixed , such that @xmath289 equivalence classes with respect to this relation are known as catastrophes .",
    "catastrophes having a codimension of at most four , that is , catastrophes which can generically be observed if no more than four control parameters are varied , have completely been classified by thom .",
    "they are known as the seven _",
    "elementary catastrophes_. each of these catastrophes can be represented by a polynomial in one or two variables .    in our discussion of periodic orbits",
    "the energy serves as the only control parameter .",
    "however , we are only interested in stationary points of functions which can be obtained as action functions in hamiltonian systems . due to this restriction , we can generically observe scenarios which would have higher codimensions in the general context of catastrophe theory , so that catastrophes of codimension greater than one are relevant for our purpose .",
    "the variation of energy then defines a path @xmath290 in an abstract higher - dimensional control space .    in earlier work on the contruction of uniform approximations close to nongeneric bifurcations , main and wunner @xcite succeeded in relating the action function describing the bifurcation scenario to one of the elementary catastrophes . in our case , however",
    ", this approach fails because the codimension ( in the sense of catastrophe theory ) of the action function is even higher than four .",
    "nevertheless , we can make use of the equivalence relation of catastrophe theory , because , as was shown above , the normal form has got stationary points which exactly correspond to the periodic orbits of the classical system .",
    "this observation enables us in principle to systematically construct ansatz functions for any bifurcation scenario encountered in a hamiltonian system using normal form theory .",
    "we are thus led to making the ansatz @xmath291 here , the energy @xmath14 serves as the control parameter , @xmath91 denotes the normal form of the bifurcation scenario , @xmath292 and @xmath287 unknown coordinate changes as in the general context of catastrophe theory , and @xmath293 is the action of the central periodic orbit , which has to be introduced here to make both sides equal at the origin .",
    "the unknown transformations @xmath292 and @xmath287 can easily be accounted for because they can only manifest themselves in appropriate choices of the free parameters occuring in the normal form . inserting the ansatz ( [ katastansatz ] ) into ( [ intdarst ] ) and transforming the integration measure to new coordinates",
    "@xmath294 , we obtain @xmath295 where @xmath296 denotes the jacobian matrix of @xmath292 with respect to the variables @xmath250 and @xmath297 . differentiating the ansatz ( [ katastansatz ] ) twice",

    "the normal form parameters , however , still have to be determined . on the other hand ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath301 is completely unknown . to evaluate ( [ unifint ] )",
    ", we have to establish a connection between @xmath302 and classical periodic orbits . as periodic orbits correspond to stationary points of the normal form , we will now analyse the behavior of @xmath302 at stationary points of the exponent .    by ( [ fdef ] ) , the hessian matrix of @xmath281 is given by @xmath303        { \\frac{\\partial^2\\hat{s}}{\\partialy\\partialp_y'}}+1 & { \\frac{\\partial^2\\hat{s}}{\\partial p_y'{}^2 } }      \\end{pmatrix}\\ ] ] so that the hessian determinant reads @xmath304 as can be shown , in a two - degree - of - freedom system the monodromy matrix of a periodic orbit can be expressed in terms of the action function as @xmath305 so that @xmath306 and @xmath307 furthermore , we make use of the fact that at a stationary point the derivative @xmath308 gives the orbital period of the corresponding periodic orbit . for the central periodic orbit ,",
    "this is @xmath0 times the primitive period @xmath309 , for a satellite orbit , however , it gives a single primitive period @xmath310 .",
    "altogether , these results yield @xmath311 where the notation @xmath312 is meant to indicate that the factor of @xmath0 has to be omitted for a satellite orbit .",
    "this expression can be calculated once the normal form parameters have suitably been determined .",
    "furthermore , ( [ xstat ] ) allows us to check that ( [ unifint ] ) does indeed reduce to gutzwiller s isolated - orbits contributions if the distance from the bifurcations is large : if the stationary points of the normal form are sufficiently isolated , we can return to a stationary - phase approximation of the integral .",
    "we will first calculate the contribution of the stationary point at @xmath313 , which corresponds to the central periodic orbit .",
    "if we use @xmath314 and ( [ xstat ] ) and let @xmath179 denote the number of negative eigenvalues of the hessian matrix @xmath315 , this contribution reads @xmath316 if we identify @xmath317 with the maslov index of the central periodic orbit , and note that in a two - degree - of - freedom system @xmath318 , this is just gutzwiller s periodic - orbit contribution .",
    "satellite orbits contribute only at energies where they are real .",
    "in this case , every satellite orbit corresponds to @xmath0 stationary points of the normal form .",
    "altogether , they contribute @xmath319 here , the number of negative eigenvalues of @xmath320 was denoted by @xmath321 , and we made use of the fact that , according to our ansatz ( [ katastansatz ] ) , @xmath322 equals the action @xmath323 of the satellite orbit .",
    "thus , we also obtain gutzwiller s contribution for satellite orbits , provided that @xmath324 is the maslov index of the satellite orbit .",
    "we can regard this as a consistency condition which allows us to calculate the difference in maslov index between the central periodic orbit and the satellites from the normal form .",
    "now that we have convinced ourselves that the integral formula ( [ unifint ] ) is correct , we can go over to its numerical evaluation .",
    "this can be done to different degrees of approximation , and we are going to present two different approximations in the following sections .      to obtain the simplest approximation possible , we can try to determine the normal form parameters @xmath325 so that the stationary values ( [ nf3wirk ] ) of the normal form ( [ nf3var ] ) globally reproduce the actions of the periodic orbits as well as possible . in the spirit of the stationary - phase method we can further assume the integral in ( [ unifint ] ) to be dominated by those parts of the coordinate plane where the stationary points of the exponent are located . as the uniform approximation is only needed close to a bifurcation , where the stationary - phase approximation fails , all stationary points lie in a neighborhood of the origin @xmath146 .",
    "thus , we can approximate the derivative @xmath308 by its value at the origin , that is , the orbital period @xmath309 of the central periodic orbit .",
    "furthermore , we can try and approximate the quotient @xmath326 by a constant @xmath105 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath327 thus , the density of states is approximately given by the integral of a known function which can be evaluated numerically .    in our case ,",
    "the distance from the period - quadrupling bifurcation is described by the normal form parameter @xmath139 .",
    "we choose to measure this distance by the difference in scaled energy @xmath328 then , to globally reproduce the numerically calculated actions , we use the parameter values @xmath329 where the tilde indicates that the parameters have been adjusted to the scaled actions @xmath330 .",
    "as can be seen from figures [ jvglabb ] and [ detvglabb ] , the action differences and hessian determinants calculated from the normal form do indeed qualitatively reproduce the acual data , although quantitatively the agreement is not very good",
    ". nevertheless , we will try and calculate the density of states within the present approximation .",
    "if we are actually going to calculate spectra for different values of the magnetic field strength , we have to determine the action @xmath331 according to the scaling prescription ( [ wirkskal ] ) with the scaling parameter @xmath332 . as can easily be seen with the help of ( [ nf3wirk ] )",
    ", this scaling can be achieved by scaling the normal form parameters according to @xmath333 according to its definition ( [ epsdef ] ) , the parameter @xmath139 does not scale .",
    "neither does @xmath105 scale with the magnetic field strength , because it is given by a quotient of two non - scaling quantities , but the factor of @xmath76 in @xmath334 has to be taken into account : @xmath335    the local approximation calculated with these data is shown in figure [ lokabb ] for three different values of the magnetic field strength . instead of the real part",
    ", we actually plotted the absolute value of the expression in ( [ lokint ] ) to suppress the highly oscillatory factor @xmath336 . as was to be expected",
    ", the approximation does indeed give finite values at the bifurcation points , but does not reproduce the results of gutzwiller s trace formula as the distance from the bifurcations is increased .",
    "this is due to the fact that the normal form with the parameter values chosen does not reproduce the actual orbital data very well . in particular",
    ", a better description of the actions is needed to improve the approximation , because asymptotically the actions occur as phases in gutzwiller s trace formula , so that , if the error in phases @xmath337 is not small compared to @xmath76 , the interference effects between the contributions of different orbits can not correctly be described .",
    "furthermore , we can not even expect our local approximation to yield very accurate values at the bifurcation points themselves , because the normal form parameters were chosen to globally reproduce the orbital data , so that a local parameter fit designed to describe the immediate neighborhood of the bifurcations would lead to different results .      to improve our approximation ,",
    "we can make use of the fact that the coordinate transformation @xmath292 in ( [ katastansatz ] ) is energy - dependent in general , so that the normal form parameters @xmath338 will also depend on energy .",
    "we thus have to choose the parameters so as to reproduce the numerically calculated action differences for any fixed @xmath339 .",
    "to achieve this , we have to solve equations ( [ nf3wirk ] ) @xmath340 where @xmath341 for @xmath338 . to this end ,",
    "we introduce    @xmath342    the second equation yields @xmath343 inserting this into the first equation of ( [ hpmdef ] ) , we obtain @xmath344 this is a cubic equation for @xmath345 .",
    "its solutions read , from cardani s formula , @xmath346{-\\left(\\sqrt{\\phi_+}+\\sqrt{\\phi_-}\\right)^2 } }             + \\frac{\\lambda^\\ast}{2 }                { \\sqrt[\\leftroot{3}\\uproot{3 } 3]{-\\left(\\sqrt{\\phi_+}-\\sqrt{\\phi_-}\\right)^2}}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath347 is a cube root of unity .",
    "if the discriminant @xmath348 is positive , there is only one real solution for @xmath345 , which has @xmath349 . if , however , @xmath350 , all three solutions are real . in this case",
    "we have to choose one solution before we can proceed .    using the correspondence between stationary points and periodic orbits discussed above",
    ", we find from figure [ datafig ] that @xmath351 , and there exists an @xmath352 so that @xmath353",
    "if @xmath354 and @xmath355 if @xmath356 . thus , from ( [ diskr ] ) , we have @xmath357 if @xmath358 , and we have to choose @xmath349 if @xmath356 to make @xmath345 real .    to determine the correct choice of @xmath179 for @xmath354 , we demand that @xmath345 must depend on @xmath139 continuously .",
    "thus , @xmath179 can only change at energies where ( [ deltaglg ] ) has a double root , viz .",
    "@xmath359 or @xmath360 .",
    "therefore , it suffices to determine @xmath179 in a neighborhood of @xmath231 .",
    "close to @xmath231 , the action differences can be seen from figure [ datafig ] to behave like @xmath361 with positive real constants @xmath362 .",
    "equations ( [ deltalsg ] ) and ( [ etavondelta ] ) then allow us to expand @xmath363 in a taylor series in @xmath139 : @xmath364 if we require this result to reproduce the definition @xmath365 we find the conditions @xmath366 and are thus led to the correct choices of @xmath179 : @xmath367 using this result , we obtain @xmath345 and @xmath363 from ( [ deltalsg ] ) and ( [ etavondelta ] ) .",
    "finally , from ( [ etadeltadef ] ) and ( [ nf3wirk2 ] ) we can explicitly determine the normal form parameters @xmath325 as functions of the energy @xmath139 and the action differences @xmath368 and @xmath369 : @xmath370    now that the normal form @xmath91 has been completely specified , a suitable approximation to the coefficient @xmath302 remains to be found .",
    "we shall assume @xmath302 to be independent of the angular coordinate @xmath36 , and because , from ( [ xstat ] ) , the value of @xmath302 is known at the stationary points of @xmath281 at four different values of @xmath140 ( including @xmath146 ) , we can approximate @xmath302 by the third - order polynomial @xmath371 interpolating between the four given points , so that our uniform approximation takes its final form @xmath372 this choice insures that our approximation reproduces gutzwiller s isolated - orbits formula if , sufficiently far away from the bifurcation , the integral is evaluated in stationary - phase approximation .",
    "thus , our solution is guaranteed to exhibit the correct asymptotic behavior . on the other hand , as was shown above , very close to the bifurcations the integral is dominated by the region around the origin . as our interpolating polynomial assumes the correct value of @xmath302 at @xmath146 , we can expect our uniform approximation to be very accurate in the immediate neighborhood of the bifurcations , too , and thus to yield good results for the semiclassical density of states in the complete energy range .",
    "the values of the normal form parameters @xmath338 calculated from ( [ abc ] ) are shown in figure [ abcabb ] .",
    "obviously , their calculation becomes numerically unstable close to the bifurcations .",
    "this is due to two reasons :    * as input data to ( [ abc ] ) , we need action differences between the central orbit and the satellite orbits .",
    "close to the bifurcations , these differences become arbitrarily small and can thus be determined from the numerically calculated actions to low precision only . * the parameter @xmath373 is given by the quotient of @xmath363 and @xmath139 , which quantities both vanish at the bifurcation energy .",
    "as the bifurcation energy @xmath60 , and hence @xmath139 , is not known to arbitrarily high precision , the zeroes of the numerator and the denominator do not exactly coincide , so that the quotient assumes a pole .",
    "we can smooth the parameters by simply interpolating their values from the numerically stable to the unstable regimes .",
    "as the dependence of the parameters on energy is very smooth , we can expect this procedure to yield accurate results .",
    "the uniform approximation was calculated for the same values of the magnetic field strength as was the local approximation .",
    "the results are displayed in figure [ unifabb ] .",
    "they are finite at the bifurcation energies and do indeed reproduce the results of gutzwiller s trace formula as the distance from the bifurcation increases . even the complicated oscillatory structures in the density of states which are caused by interferences betweeen contributions from different periodic orbits are perfectly reproduced by our uniform approximation .",
    "we can also see that the higher the magnetic field strength , the farther away from the bifurcation energies is the asumptotic ( gutzwiller ) behavior acquired .",
    "in fact , for the largest field strength @xmath374 the asymptotic regime is not reached at all in the energy range shown .",
    "this behavior can be traced back to the fact that , due to the scaling properties of the diamagnetic kepler problem , the scaling parameter @xmath375 plays the rle of an effective planck s constant , therefore the lower @xmath376 becomes , the more accurate the semiclassical approximation will be .",
    "we have shown that in generic hamiltonian systems bifurcations of ghost orbits can occur besides the bifurcations of real orbits .",
    "if they occur in the neighborhood of a bifurcation of a real orbit , they produce signatures in semiclassical spectra in much the same way as bifurcations of real orbits and therefore are of equal importance to a semiclassical understanding of the quantum spectra .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the technique of normal form expansions traditionally used to construct uniform approximations taking account of bifurcations of real orbits only can be extended to also include the effects of ghost orbit bifurcations .",
    "thus , normal form theory offers techniques which will allow us , at least in principle , to calculate uniform approximations for arbitrarily complicated bifurcation scenarios .",
    "the effects ghost orbit bifurcations exert on semiclassical spectra were illustrated by way of example of the period - quadrupling bifurcation of the balloon - orbit in the diamagnetic kepler problem .",
    "this example was chosen mainly because of its simplicity , because the balloon - orbit is one of the shortest periodic orbits in the diamagnetic kepler problem , and the period - quadrupling is the lowest period-@xmath0-tupling bifurcation that can exhibit the island - chain - bifurcation typical of all higher @xmath0 .",
    "we can therefore expect ghost orbit bifurcations also to occur for longer orbits and in connection with higher period-@xmath0-tupling bifurcations .",
    "this conjeture is confirmed by the discussion of the various bifurcation scenarios described by the higher - order normal form ( [ nf3 ] ) , which reveals ghost orbit bifurcations close to a period - quadrupling in three out of four possible cases .",
    "thus , ghost orbit bifurcations will be a common occurence in generic hamiltonian systems .",
    "their systematic study remains an open problem for future work .",
