    "the choice of metric on @xmath88 is not so crucial .",
    "it suffices that the metric coincides with the original metric outside a sufficiently small neighborhood of the sphere along which the surgery is performed .",
    "the second , more complicated , part consists of showing that @xmath88 has no further dirac eigenvalues in the interval @xmath94 .",
    "this requires a finer analysis of the behavior of eigenspinors .",
    "first we make the scalar curvature on @xmath18 very large on a neighborhood @xmath95 of the surgery sphere by a @xmath96-small deformation of the metric ( section 2.1 ) .",
    "this property persists under surgery of codimension @xmath1 .",
    "here we use the construction of gromov and lawson which shows that the class of manifolds admitting metrics of positive scalar curvature is closed under surgery of codimension @xmath1 .",
    "hence scalar curvature is very large in the corresponding open subset @xmath97 of @xmath66 .",
    "this implies that most of the @xmath98-norm of an eigenspinor is supported in the complement @xmath99 ( section 2.2 ) .",
    "then we do a finer analysis of the distribution of the @xmath98-norm on certain annular regions ( section 2.3 ) .",
    "this finally allows us to multiply an eigenspinor of @xmath88 with a cut - off function whose gradient is supported in such an annular region where the eigenspinor carries only very little @xmath98-norm .",
    "therefore the bad error term in the rayleigh quotient coming from the gradient of the cut - off function is under good control .",
    "it follows that to each eigenvalue of @xmath88 there corresponds one of @xmath18 and we are done .",
    "it should be noted that the proof is not at all symmetric in @xmath18 and @xmath88 because the metric on @xmath88 is not given beforehand and therefore various geometric quantities are not under a - priori control . to make the second part work we must choose the metric on @xmath88 very carefully .      in this subsection",
    "we show that the scalar curvature can be made large near a submanifold by a @xmath96-small deformation of the metric ( which does not change the dirac eigenvalues much )",
