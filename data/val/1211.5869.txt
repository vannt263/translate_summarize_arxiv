    "when a cylindrical obstacle is moved in a viscous fluid with an appropriate velocity , vortices are periodically shed in the wake , forming a long - lived vortex street .",
    "this phenomenon was experimentally studied by bnard  @xcite and the stability of the vortex street was theoretically investigated by von krmn  @xcite in the early twentieth century . the bnard ",
    "von krmn ( bvk ) vortex streets are observed in a wide scale throughout nature : from a bathtub to the atmosphere on a planet .",
    "the behaviors of a classical viscous fluid past an obstacle are characterized by the reynolds number , re , which is proportional to the size and velocity of the obstacle and inversely proportional to the kinematic viscosity .",
    "a stationary flow is stable for a small value of re .",
    "when re exceeds a critical value , an instability sets in and vortices are shed in the wake , forming the bvk vortex street .",
    "for a very large value of re , the flow behind the obstacle becomes turbulence .",
    "thus , in a classical fluid , the viscosity , which is included in re , plays an important role for the vortex street generation .",
    "in contrast , sasaki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite theoretically predicted that a bvk - like vortex street can also be generated in superfluids , in which viscosity is absent and a vortex is quantized .",

    ", it has been found that such a vibrating cylinder in a flow generates various types of vortex streets , in which the symmetry between two rows of vortices is broken  @xcite .",
    "we will show that such symmetry breaking occurs also for the bvk vortex street in a superfluid .",

    "the vortex dipoles have the symmetry with respect to the @xmath42 axis , and after some time the inclination of the vortex dipoles starts .",
