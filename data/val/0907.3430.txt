    "it is well known that a single linear ( non - branched ) polymer consisting of @xmath1 monomers in a diluted solution with a good solvent where it is in a swollen conformation with gyration ( flory ) radius @xmath2 , @xmath3 , undergoes a phase transition to a collapsed globule  with flory radius @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the dimensionality of space ) if the solvent quality deteriorates as it usually does when the temperature of the solution is lowered below the so - called @xmath6-point .",
    "many theoretical tools have been successfully applied to linear polymers , and considerable progress has been made in understanding this collapse transition  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , much less is known about collapse transition of randomly branched polymers , which are usually assumed being macroscopically either isotropic or directed .",
    "as far as the isotropic case is concerned , a number of numerical studies has been performed over the last 20 years or so  @xcite .",
    "the picture that arises from these studies is much more complex than that for the collapse of linear polymers .",
    "the basic reason for this added complexity is the possibility for introducing more than one fugacity to drive the collapse .",
    "it appears that the line of collapse transitions in the phase diagram consist of 2 qualitatively different parts .",
    "one part of the line , called the line of @xmath6-transitions , corresponds to continuous transitions with universal critical exponents from swollen polymer configurations with tree - like character to compact coil - like configurations .",
    "the other part of the transition line , the line of @xmath7-transitions , corresponds to the collapse of swollen foam- or sponge - like polymers with many cycles of bonds between the monomers to vesicle - like compact structures .",
    "if this transition is assumed to be continuous , one finds nonuniversal exponents  @xcite .",
    "the two different parts of the collapse - transition line are separated by a higher multicritical point which belongs to the isotropic percolation universality class .",
    "one of the open questions regarding the phase diagram is the existence of a possible further transition line between the configurations of the collapsed polymers .    as far as directed branched polymers ( dbp ) and their collapse ( cdbp )",
    "is concerned , the theoretical picture  @xcite is somewhat clearer than in the isotropic case , in particular in @xmath8-dimensions ( one transversal and one longitudinal ; in the following , we will denote the full space dimension as @xmath9 ) . noting that branched polymers , lattice animals , and lattice trees belong to the same universality class",
    ", one can use the results of dhar @xcite on collapsing directed strongly embedded or site animals .",
    "this way , henkel and seno @xcite have shown that there is only one type of @xmath6-transitions which describes the collapse of directed branched polymers in @xmath10-dimensions .",
    "this collapse transition belongs to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class .",
    "furthermore , dhar has shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the collapse transition is also of directed percolation type in @xmath11 if a special relation between the potentials ( fugacities ) of directed site animals holds .",
    "flory theory was applied by redner and coniglio @xcite .",
    "they correctly derived the upper critical dimension @xmath12 , but they found critical exponents for the cdbp transition that are different from the dp exponents which , however , is incorrect as we shall see .    whereas a comprehensive field theory for swollen ( extended ) polymers",
    "has been existing for quite some time , the field theory for the collapse of branched polymers is much less developed .",
    "as far as we know , there exist to date no field theory for the directed case . for the isotropic case",
    ", there is the seminal work by lubensky and isaacson @xcite and harris and lubensky @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that these papers , as far as they consider the collapse transition , contain a fundamental error in the renormalization procedure ( they overlook a required renormalization ) , and as a consequence the long - standing @xmath13-loop results for the collapse transition are not entirely correct  @xcite . in an upshot , one may say that there are important open questions and unresolved issues in the theory for the collapse of directed and isotropic branched polymers .    here and in a following publication  @xcite , we develop dynamical field theories for the collapse of directed and isotropic branched polymers , respectively . the idea behind these theories",
    "is to start out with stochastic activation processes which lead to percolation clusters and then to exploit the well know connection between branched polymers and lattice animals , i.e. , cluster of a given mass .",
    "we concentrate on large animals below the percolation point , and we equip the theory with enough parameters to allow for triciticality which corresponds to the collapse of large branched polymers . as alluded to above , the directed case has the benefit of being simpler than the isotropic case .",
    "it allows us to learn about the fundamental structure of dynamical field theories for the collapse of branched polymers and thereby to sharpen our tools for the more complicated isotropic case .",
    "the most important concrete result of the present paper is that we show to arbitrary order in renormalized perturbation theory with @xmath0-expansion that the cdbp transition is of dp - type .",
    "the outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows : in sec .",

    "sec : meanfieldtheory ] we analyze our model in mean - field theory .",
    "we determine the mean - field phase diagram of dbp and discuss their scaling behavior at the collapse transition ignoring fluctuations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : noncollapsing ] , we briefly discuss swollen dbp by making contact to established theories . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fieldtheory ] , we present the core of our field theoretic analysis of the collapse transition .",
    "we discuss the scaling invariances of our model at this transition and their consequences .",
    "we calculate the counter - terms required to renormalize our theory in a 1-loop calculation and by using ward identities .",
    "we set up and solve renormalization group equations that provide us with the scaling form of the equation of state and correlation lengths . in sec .",
    "[ sec : polymerscaling ] , we translate our field theoretic results for the collapse transition into a form that is more commonly used in polymer theory , and we compare them to numerical simulations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : concludingremarks ] , we give a few concluding remarks .",
    "there are tow appendixes . in appendix",
    "[ app:1loop ] , we present some details of our 1-loop calculation , and in appendix  [ app : essentialsingularities ] , we discuss essential singularities .",
    "in this subsection , we develop a field theoretic stochastic functional @xcite for dbp based on very general arguments alluding to the universal properties of a corresponding markoffian stochastic percolation process .",
    "we consider polymers as clusters in @xmath5 transversal and @xmath13 longitudinal ( time ) directions . below the percolation threshold",
    "all of the clusters generated by such a process are finite .",
    "the distribution function for the large clusters decays exponentially with their mass ( number of monomers ) .",
    "it is well known @xcite that untypical very large clusters with linear sizes essentially larger than the correlation lengths are generated as rare events .",
    "the statistical properties of these fractal clusters belong to the universality class of lattice animals .",
    "thus , they also form the prototype model for single randomly branched polymers in a dilute solution . allowing for a further mechanism in the percolation process which favors contacts of the monomers , we introduce a possible tricritical instability that leads to the collapse of the large clusters describing the branched polymers .    a langevin equation",
    "which describes directed percolation processes allowing for tricritical behavior has been well known for many years @xcite .",
    "it is based on the fundamental phenomenological principles of absorbing processes in conjunction with a density and gradient expansion .",
    "the basic variable or field is the density @xmath14 of agents ( infected individuals ) , which models the fractal monomer - density of the polymer generated from a given source @xmath15 .",
    "this choice of field is possible because the stochastic process generates clusters such that the numbers of monomers , branching- , and end - points are all of the same order which is in contrast to the case of linear polymers . in other words ,",
    "the density is a proper field for the current problem because branched polymers are really `` fur - bearing animals '' .",
    "the langevin equation in ito - interpretation is given by    [ stochproz ] @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a kinetic coefficient , and the noise correlation reads @xmath18\\,\\delta(\\mathbf{x } -\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime})\\,\\delta(t - t^{\\prime})\\ , .",
    "\\label{langkorr}\\ ] ]    we assume gaussian noise which we can for our purposes without loss of generality because higher order noise does not change the universal properties of the process .",
    "the leading terms of the expansions are @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "further terms in the expansions are possible but they turn out being irrelevant . in mean - field theory , the percolation transition occurs at @xmath23 .",
    "as announced above , we restrict ourself in the following to the region @xmath24 in which only non - percolating directed branched clusters with a typical linear size @xmath25 are generated from a time- and space - localized source . however , our primary interest is in the rare events where the fractal clusters of linear size essentially larger than @xmath26 are generated . as long as @xmath27 ,",
    "the second order term @xmath28 of the rate @xmath29 is irrelevant .",
    "we permit both signs of @xmath30 so that our model accounts for a tricritical instability .",
    "consequently , we need the second order term with @xmath31 for stabilization purposes , i.e. , to limit the density @xmath32 to finite values . the parameters @xmath33 ( which are irrelevant for the original percolation problem ) are assumed to be positive to smooth density fluctuations .",
    "an essential property of percolation processes is the linear dependence of the noise correlation ( [ langkorr ] ) on the density if @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "this property guarantees that the percolation process is really absorbing @xcite , and guarantees the description by a density variable .",
    "last but not least , all the terms lead to @xmath36 if @xmath37 and @xmath38 on grounds of the absorbing state .",
    "the approach that we are taking focuses on general principles for processes belonging to the same universality class and is therefore necessarily phenomenological  @xcite .",
    "we devise our field theoretic model representing the universality class using a purely mesoscopic stochastic formulation based on the correct order parameters identified through physical insight in the nature of the critical phenomenon .",
    "hence , the stochastic response functional that we are about to derive stays in full analogy to the landau - ginzburg - wilson functional and provides a reliable starting point of the field theoretic method .",
    "alternatively , one might use the so - called exact  approach which , as a central step , consists of reformulating a microscopic master - equation for chemical reactions as a bosonic field theory on a lattice . for a recent excellent review article on this method see @xcite .",
    "we choose not to use this method as our main approach because we feel that it treats universal properties not as transparently as the purely mesoscopic formulation does .",
    "nonetheless , we think that the lattice reactions which would be the starting point for the exact  approach to the current problem have some pedagogical value as they can help to nurture ones intuition about the epidemic process . here , these reactions comprise the well known reactions leading to dp :    [ reakt ] @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes a lattice point , @xmath41 denotes a vector to a neighboring point , and @xmath42 stands for an agent ( particle ) at @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , because we are interested in tricriticality , we need additional reactions that produce more compact clusters : @xmath43    for illustrations of the reactions defined in eq .",
    "( [ reakt ] ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : reactions ] and refs .  @xcite .",
    "note that the single site back - reactions , eqs .",
    "( [ back1 ] ) and ( [ back2 ] ) act against multiple occupations of lattice sites and are thus reminiscent of an excluded - volume interaction . as mentioned above",
    ", we will not use the exact  approach in this paper .",
    "however , for the adherents of the exact  approach , we mention without presenting further details that we have verified that he bosonic representation of the reaction equations ( [ reakt ] ) leads to the same stochastic functional ( called an action in that approach ) as the purely mesoscopic approach .        returning to the latter approach , we now recast the langevin equations  ( [ stochproz ] ) as a stochastic response functional @xcite @xmath44 here , we have neglected further higher order terms that will not result in any relevant contributions to our final response functional .",

    "one has to be careful to set the range of the variables of the functional integration correctly as there are some subtleties involved .",
    "some authors @xcite use functional integrals of the type featured in eq .",
    "( [ unrestrav ] ) purely in a restricted sense as a device for generating a perturbation expansion .",
    "this precautionary view arises from a narrow interpretation of the bosonic functional integral after elimination of irrelevant terms including higher order monomials of the fields which are in general required to ensure the convergence when fields become large .",
    "however these convergence problems can and should be avoided by choosing the support for the functional integration properly , as was shown e.g.  by ciafaloni and onofri @xcite in the case of reggeon field theory ( rft which is equivalent to dp ) .",
    "this type of consideration leads here to the rule that @xmath32 is to be integrated along the positive real axis whereas the integration of @xmath46 is performed along the full imaginary axis .",
    "of course , deviations in finite regions , as e.g.  suggested by saddle - points , are possible .",
    "one of the most important observables in the current problem is the mass or total number of monomers of a cluster , @xmath50 where we have included the kinetic coefficient @xmath17 into the definition for later convenience ( if we were not including @xmath17 in the definition of @xmath51 , we had to multiply @xmath51 in subsequent formulas by @xmath17 on dimensional grounds ) .",
    "because we are mainly interested in the scaling behavior of a single large polymer with @xmath52 monomers , we will focus in the following on averages that are restricted to clusters of a given mass @xmath1 , and we assume without loss of generality that this cluster emanates from a weak source @xmath53 of agents at the origin @xmath54 at time @xmath55 . for our general observable @xmath56 $ ] , this leads to @xmath57\\exp\\bigl ( q\\tilde{n}(\\mathbf{0},0)\\bigr)\\rangle_{\\rm{dp } } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\simeq q\\langle\\delta \\bigl(n-\\mathcal{m}\\bigr)\\mathcal{o}[n ] \\tilde{n}(\\mathbf{0},0))\\rangle_{\\rm{dp } }   \\,,\\label{restrav}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the probability distribution for finding a cluster of given mass @xmath1 with the last equation holding only asymptotically for large @xmath1 and small @xmath59 . note that the zeroth - order term in the taylor expansion leading to the second line of eq .",

    "now we turn to the signature of the collapse transition .",
    "chemically , in a diluted solution the transition occurs when the hard core repulsion of the monomers is exactly compensated by their weak effective attraction , i.e. , when the second virial coefficient @xmath79 in the expansion of the osmotic pressure in powers of the polymer density vanishes  @xcite .",
    "up to a minus sign this second virial - coefficient is proportional to the space integral of the correlation function between two polymers in the solution .",
