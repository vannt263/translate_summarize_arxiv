    "many of these features are linearly polarized .",
    "they extend up to high galactic latitudes but they are very faint , an order of magnitude fainter than the large - scale diffuse galactic emission",
    ". however , the study of these structures may provide important clues for the understanding of the `` disk  halo connection '' .",
    "the interpretation favours chimneys , fountains , parker loops or superbubbles created by ob associations to transfer material from the disk into the halo .",
    "they will deform and compress the galactic magnetic field .",
    "if these structures account for the rather smooth nonthermal background , they have to be sufficiently numerous and large .",
    "the galactic region above @xmath3 and below @xmath4 , where the just mentioned structures play an important role , has never been studied in a systematic way .",
    "large - scale surveys covering this area either suffer from low angular resolution or they miss the diffuse emission as it is the case for the 1.4  ghz vla - survey ( condon et al .",
    "a combination of 1.4  ghz data from the effelsberg telescope with high angular resolution data from the vla is of particular importance to separate compact background sources from faint extended galactic structures .",
    "an example has already been shown and discussed by frst et al .",

    "one of the milestones in the research of galactic magnetic fields is due to brouw & spoelstra ( @xcite ) and spoelstra ( @xcite ) .",
    "they have surveyed the northern sky in linear polarization with the dwingeloo 25-m telescope at 1.411  ghz at an angular resolution of about half a degree .",

    "ghz junkes et al .",
    "( @xcite ) published a survey of the linear polarization of the galactic plane ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",

    "5 ) , all these polarization surveys are constrained to the galactic plane . on the low frequency side , at 327  mhz , wieringa et al .",
    "( @xcite ) observed small - scale variations in polarization at high latitudes with the westerbork synthesis telescope .",
    "the knowledge of the magnetic field in the galactic halo even in the immediate vicinity of the galactic plane is limited , because of the lack of observations of the linear polarization at the proper angular resolution and sensitivity . to fill this gap new observations at 1.4  ghz",
    "are being carried out to cover the entire galactic plane at medium galactic latitudes ( @xmath8 ) visible at effelsberg .",
    "this survey will reach a sensitivity at total intensity close to the confusion limit ( @xmath9  mk t@xmath1 ) and an even higher sensitivity ( @xmath10  mk t@xmath1 ) at linear polarization .",
    "we discuss the general survey parameters and observing method in sect .",
    "an absolute calibration method for the total intensity data is described in sect .",
    "the method developed to overcome the usual problem of polarimetric observations , the instrumental polarization , is demonstrated in sect .",
    "4 . in sect .  5",
    "we propose a procedure to adjust the polarization data to an absolute temperature scale .",
    "the observations of the survey are carried out with the two - channel 1.31.7  ghz receiver installed in the primary focus of the effelsberg 100-m telescope .",
    "the receiver is equipped with cooled hemt amplifiers recording the left- and right - hand circularly polarized component simultaneously ( see schmidt & zinz   @xcite ) .",
    "these amplifiers are of very high stability , and total intensity observations are limited by confusion which is reached after about 2  s of integration time .",
    "an if - polarimeter converts the circularly polarized component into linear components ( stokes parameter @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "stokes parameter @xmath13 is obtained by simply adding both circularly polarized components .",
    "the method of observation is to scan each field along constant galactic latitude as well as along constant galactic longitude .",
    "each field was measured at least twice .",
    "the telescope parameters relevant to the 1.4  ghz survey are listed in table  [ surpar ] .",

    "daytime observations cause inacceptable distortions in both the total intensity and the polarization data due to contribution of solar emission to the far sidelobes of the telescope ( kalberla et al.@xcite ) .",
    "therefore all observations are carried out at nighttime , when additional ionospheric faraday rotation effects are minimal and included by corrections inferred by observations of calibration sources .",
    "calibration sources were 3c286 , 3c138 and 3c48 , where 3c286 served as the primary calibrator both in total intensity and polarization .",
    "the scale accuracy for total and polarized intensities is better than 5% .",
    "as seen from their coordinates , calibration sources have large angular separations on the sky , so that at least one of them is accessible at all times .",

    "the dynamic range exceeds 30  db .",
    "the maximum of the first sidelobes , which are enhanced by the four subreflector support legs , are at a level of about @xmath2220  db . the cross - polarization lobes of stokes parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 are dominated by a main beam component , which varies with parallactic angle .",
    "a correction of that instrumental response is described below .",
    "the first stage of the data reduction made use of the standard `` toolbox '' procedure ( cont2 , von kap - herr   @xcite ) for continuum and polarization observations with the effelsberg telescope . from the tabulated scans",
    "calibrated maps were computed for all the four data channels ( two times @xmath13 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) recorded .",
    "a linear baseline using data points at the end of each scan was subtracted from each channel .",
    "all later stages of the data reduction are based on the nod2 program package ( haslam  @xcite ) .",
    "spiky data were removed .",
    "scanning effects were suppressed by using the method of unsharp masking developed by sofue & reich ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the two maps observed in orthogonal directions for each of the stokes parameters have been added using the plait program ( emerson & grve   @xcite ) , which reduces `` scanning effects '' from individual distortions or by the baseline setting procedure in the case of an emission structure located at the edge of a map by appropriate weighted addition of the fourier transforms of both maps .",
    "the polarization @xmath11 and @xmath12 maps were corrected for instrumental polarization as described in sect .  4 before combining the maps observed in orthogonal directions .",
    "from the observation and the method of data reduction it is obvious that neither the total intensity nor the polarization maps are on an absolute temperature scale .",
    "the total intensity maps are calibrated to an absolute scale using the 1.4  ghz northern sky survey by reich ( @xcite ) and reich & reich ( @xcite ) carried out with the stockert 25-m telescope .",
    "this procedure has already been described by reich et al .",
    "( @xcite ) when calibrating the effelsberg 1.4  ghz galactic plane survey .",
    "the stockert survey has a scale accuracy of 5% and an uncertainty of the absolute zero - level of 0.5  k.    briefly , the effelsberg data and the stockert data are convolved to an angular resolution slightly exceeding that of the stockert 1.4  ghz survey ( hpbw 36 ) and the difference between the two data sets is added to the effelsberg data .",
    "this procedure also improves the original effelsberg maps since large - scale distortions by atmospheric and ground radiation variations are removed .",
    "however , still existing faint baseline effects in the low resolution stockert data are also added to the higher resolution effelsberg data .",
    "such distortions were found to exist on small scales but not on the large - scale background component , which is the missing component of the effelsberg maps .",
    "a modified version to calibrate the effelsberg maps absolutely was introduced :    * convolve the effelsberg map to the resolution of the stockert map ( 36 ) .",
    "decompose this map into a large - scale component ( eff.back ) and a map with small - scale structures using the `` background filtering method '' ( sofue & reich   @xcite ) with a @xmath23 gaussian beam for smoothing .",
    "* subtract the 2.8  k isotropic background component from the stockert data and convert the temperature scale from full beam into main beam ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "* decompose the stockert data to obtain the corresponding large - scale component ( sto.back ) by using the same filtering parameters as for the effelsberg data . *",
    "adjust eff.back to sto.back as described above , namely , add the difference of both large - scale component maps to the effelsberg large - scale data and add the 2.8  k isotropic background component .",
    "the resulting map is es.back . * the final effelsberg map ( eff.final )",
    "is given by : + eff.final = eff.orig + es.back - eff.back .",
    "we use the modified method only when there are non - negligible scanning effects in the source component of the stockert data . a sample region ( towards @xmath25 ) is given in fig .  [ einha ] to illustrate the effect of the absolute calibration .",
    "one major goal of the new 1.4  ghz survey is the sensitive mapping of polarized emission out of the galactic plane .",
    "however , a problem is given by the relatively high instrumental polarization mainly introduced by the cooled broad - band polarization transducer and hybrid of the l - band effelsberg receiver .",
    "a change of the bandwidth and centre frequency has a significant effect on the instrumental @xmath11 and @xmath12 components .",
    "other instrumental effects due to the antenna and feed characteristics , residual ellipticity of the polarimeter response and variations with time add , but are too small to be separated from the main effect .",
    "an attempt was made to minimize these instrumental effects to a residual effect of the order of 1% .",
    "we assume that the instrumental components @xmath26 and @xmath27 scale with the total intensity @xmath13 .",
    "when observing in an astronomical coordinate system the instrumental components depend on the parallactic angle @xmath28 .",
    "a procedure was developed to correct for this effect . from the observations of the polarized calibration sources 3c286 and 3c138 at different parallactic angles , correction factors @xmath29 and @xmath30 are calculated in such way that the nominal percentage polarization and the polarization angle are obtained .    the algorithm of the elimination of the instrumental effects is as follows : suppose @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the intrinsic values of a source in an astronomical coordinate system . @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the observed values depending on the parallactic angle @xmath28 .",
    "the instrumental values @xmath26 and @xmath27 are : @xmath35    the instrumental polarization angle @xmath36 and polarization intensity @xmath37 are : @xmath38 \\\\ \\nonumber { pi}_\\mathrm{inst}(\\phi ) & = & \\sqrt { { u}_\\mathrm{inst}^2 ( \\phi ) + { q}_\\mathrm{inst}^2 ( \\phi ) } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the correction factors @xmath29 and @xmath30 are then : @xmath39 \\\\   \\nonumber",

    "we show , as an example , the data for @xmath29 and @xmath30 from observations of 3c286 .",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are determined for each session .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath29 and @xmath30 vary with parallactic angle , which needs to be taken into account when correcting a survey map .",
    "according to the introduced procedure each pixel @xmath13 of a map is multiplied with the appropriate @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the resulting @xmath11 and @xmath12 components of the instrumental polarization are transformed into parallactic angle corrected components for each pixel of an @xmath11 and @xmath12 map and subtracted from the observed @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the procedure corrects for most of the instrumental effects .",
    "the corrected @xmath11 and @xmath12 maps are then used to calculate the polarized intensity @xmath40 and the polarization angle @xmath41 .",
    "it has been found that the correction effect on the large - scale polarization emission is not significant .",
    "strong sources , however , cause distortions which are clearly minimized by the described procedure . in fig .  [ sou12 ]",
    "we illustrate the effect of our correction procedure .",
    "we note that instrumental effects do not always act in a way to increase the observed polarization . depending on the arrangement and variations in @xmath11 and @xmath12 it is equally possible to observe the reverse of this effect .",
    "as was mentioned earlier the large - scale information in the polarization maps is lost due to the baseline fitting procedure .",
    "in addition , residual ground radiation effects may show up in view of the large sizes of the observed maps .",
    "as in the case of total power maps , the polarization emission needs to be adjusted to an absolute level .",
    "however , there exists no complete and regularly gridded low resolution polarization survey which is absolutely calibrated .",
    "fortunately , a large set of linear polarization observations at 1.4  ghz obtained with the dwingeloo 25-m telescope exists ( brouw & spoelstra  @xcite ) .",
    "these data are absolutely calibrated and corrected for all kinds of instrumental effects and therefore match the requirements for this task .",
    "however , the data are not on a regular grid and are significantly undersampled .",
    "this data set has to be regridded to be used to adjust our polarization measurements .",
    "the polarized intensity and polarization angle data from the dwingeloo survey have been provided by dr .",
    "spoelstra in digitized form .    using the @xmath40 and @xmath41 values from this measurements we calculated @xmath11 and @xmath12 values and regridded the undersampled dwingeloo data on the grid of the effelsberg maps .",
    "however , in some regions data points are too separated ( @xmath42 or more ) for an absolute calibration , and in other weakly polarized regions an s / n - ratio of 2 or less does not allow a proper adjustment .",
    "we tried two methods to interpolate the dwingeloo data on the same grid as the effelsberg maps .",
    "one way to do this is an interpolation between the data points using a `` cubic - spline interpolation '' .",
    "however , we found that a cubic - spline interpolation introduces distortions at the corners of the maps and data from a much larger area must be used to avoid this problem .",
    "moreover , a single high intensity data point affects surrounding low intensity data up to a large distance .",
    "data points must be weighted with respect to the distance .",
    "hence , we found that a cubic - spline interpolation is inadequate for most of our regions .",
    "a successful method is to weigh data points by their distances to the required map element .",
    "we used the approach @xmath43 in which @xmath44 is a constant .",
    "we calculate for each pixel of an effelsberg map the dwingeloo @xmath11 and @xmath12 data within a radius , @xmath45 , contributing with a weight as given above . for our case",
    "we found a value of @xmath46 for @xmath47 with @xmath48 to be satisfactory .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath40 dwingeloo maps of a test region at the @xmath49 grid of the effelsberg maps are given in fig .",
    "[ dwin ] .",

    "[ dwin ] . in the higher resolution",
    "effelsberg maps numerous small - scale polarization structures are visible , which are smoothed out by the large dwingeloo beam .",
    "the two data sets are combined as follows : the effelsberg map is convolved to the dwingeloo beam ( 36@xmath18 ) and subtracted from the dwingeloo map . the difference is added to the original effelsberg map .",
    "figure  [ efduq ] and fig .  [ efdpi ] show the combination for @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the corresponding @xmath40 map . in these figures",
    "the small - scale structures are much less pronounced due to the addition of the strong large - scale polarized emission which varies in the range from 200  mk to 800  mk across the map ( fig .",
    "[ dwin ] ) .",
    "the absolutely calibrated @xmath11 and @xmath12 maps may be decomposed into small - scale and large - scale features by standard methods for total intensity maps and relative @xmath40 maps can be calculated .",
    "some examples have been given by uyaniker ( @xcite ) .",
    "plots of the polarization vectors demonstrate the effect of adjusting the effelsberg data to an absolute level .",
    "the polarization angle maps are presented as vector plots in fig .",
    "[ efdpivec ] .",
    "numerous small - scale structures are visible in the original effelsberg map .",
    "the polarization angle varies largely across the maps .",
    "the electric field vectors are almost constant in the combined effelsberg - dwingeloo map .",
    "the data of this map are the same as those for fig .",
    "[ efdpi ] , but grey - scale representation is much more sensitive to small variations .",
    "we described the observation and reduction technique for a sensitive 1.4  ghz continuum and polarization survey with the effelsberg 100-m telescope .",
    "we illustrated by an example the absolute calibration of the total intensity effelsberg data by making use of the 1.4  ghz stockert survey and showed the effect on the effelsberg polarization maps after adjusting the large - scale polarized emission with the dwingeloo 1.4  ghz measurements .",
