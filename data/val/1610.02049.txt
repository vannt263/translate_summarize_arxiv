    "with the upcoming launches of the transiting exoplanet survey satellite ( tess ) and the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) , the amount and quality of exoplanetary transmission spectra available for interpretation are expected to increase dramatically . to analyze the anticipated wealth of data in a timely and statistically meaningful fashion ,",
    "many members of the exoplanet community combine sophisticated statistical algorithms ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) with instrument models and radiative transfer codes to retrieve atmospheric properties of transiting exoplanets from their lightcurves ( see e.g. analyses by @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and to plan observational strategies for jwst ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as many of these algorithms must compute numerous exoplanetary spectra as they sample across the allowed multi - dimensional space of atmospheric parameters , the forward models which compute these spectra must strike a proper balance between speed and accuracy .    in light of this ,",
    "analytical formalisms to compute exoplanetary spectra are extremely useful .",
    "they allow one to understand how key atmospheric parameters shape exoplanetary spectra , can constitute the backbone of forward models , and increase computational speed tremendously if they are general and accurate enough .",
    "they can also test , under the same conditions for which they are valid , the accuracy of more general numerical methods .",
    "one important formalism for transmission spectroscopy , against which radiative transfer codes are sometimes compared ( see e. g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and which a few analyses use ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite , 2016 ) is the semi - analytical derivation of @xcite for a homogeneous and isothermal atmosphere .    from numerical simulations ,",
    "@xcite show that for a broad range of planetary radius to scale height ratios ( @xmath0 ) , the effective radius ( @xmath1 ) of a transiting exoplanet is located at an altitude where the integrated optical depth ( or slant optical depth , @xmath2 ) along a ray grazing the planetary limb is about 0.56 .",
    "they build upon this numerical result to show analytically that the variation with wavelength of the effective radius of an exoplanet is proportional to the atmospheric scale height .",
    "later , @xcite confirm in a purely analytical fashion @xcite s results and also show that the relevant scale height of the atmosphere changes with the type of the dominant source of opacity , with collision - induced absorption ( cia ) having half the effective scale height of rayleigh scattering .",
    "@xcite also demonstrate that in the presence of an opacity source which obeys a simple known power law with wavelength , such as rayleigh scattering by gases or well - mixed hazes , one can deduce the scale height of the atmosphere by measuring the spectral slope of the rayleigh signature ( rayleigh slope ) , provided it is the only source of opacity in the observed spectral region .",
    "both formalisms are very useful for clear atmospheres , or atmospheres where hazes are well - mixed .",
    "however , a planetary surface or an optically thick cloud deck creates a sharp boundary ( or  surface \" ) below which stellar radiation is cut - off , which neither @xcite s nor @xcite s analytical expressions capture . to illustrate the impact of a  surface \" , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the limb absorption ( @xmath3 ) profile , given by @xmath4 of a constant scale height atmosphere as a function of distance in scale height ( @xmath5 ) above this  surface \" for different values of the slant optical depth of the rays grazing the  surface \" ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "as @xmath6 decreases , the limb absorption profile shifts downward . when @xmath7 , the  surface \" has no impact on the effective radius of an exoplanet because the atmosphere is completely opaque at the  surface \" .",
    "a slant optical depth of 0.561 @xcite is thus representative of the location of the effective radius of the exoplanet for this purely atmospheric profile .",
    "when @xmath8 , the limb absorption profile deviates from the purely atmospheric one because it increases sharply to one at the  surface \" , violating the assumption behind @xcite s derivation .",
    "as @xmath6 decreases , the difference in absorption between the  surface \" and the atmosphere increases , and the limb absorption profile deviates increasingly from the pure atmospheric profile . when @xmath9 , the absorption profile is sufficiently distorted from the atmospheric one that @xcite s formalism completely breaks down and predicts that the effective radius of the exoplanet is below the  surface \" .",
    "however , common sense dictates that it should be above , as there is still some atmospheric absorption .",
    "indeed , for an airless rocky exoplanet where atmospheric absorption is non - existent , its effective radius is simply located at its surface .    ) . according to @xcite and @xcite , the effective radius of an exoplanet",
    "is located at a distance above the  surface \" where the optical depth of a ray traversing the atmosphere is about 0.561 ( i.e. where the triple - dot - dashed line intersects the various limb absorption profiles ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    so not only are these formalisms ( @xcite ; @xcite ) not appropriate for terrestrial exoplanets with optically thin atmospheres , but neither are they for atmospheres where a cloud deck mimics a surface . unfortunately , there is a growing body of evidence that many exoplanets may have clouds or hazes .",
    "gj1214b is the most compelling example , as its transmission spectrum remains featureless to the best photometric precision , a fact which is more likely explained by a high altitude cloud deck than a high mean molecular weight atmosphere @xcite .",
    "indeed , cloud decks decrease the contrast of spectral features ( e. g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and are the likely cause for the reduced contrast , compared with that expected from a clear atmosphere , of the 1.4  @xmath10 m water band ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , sodium and potassium lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ) observed in a few hot jupiters .",
    "even thick cloudless atmospheres , or one with well - mixed hazes , require an analysis incorporating a  surface \" as recent results ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) show that thick atmospheres have a sharp change in flux due to refraction .",
    "indeed , a refracted distorted image of the stellar surface is superimposed on the limb absorption profile @xcite , and the refractive boundary can be predominantly due to a change in the back - illumination of the atmosphere at the imaged stellar limb , unlike clouds and surfaces which only change the limb absorption profile .",
    "the spectroscopic signature of this first - order refractive effect and an optically thick cloud deck are similar in nature because they both cause lower atmospheric regions to appear dark in transmission spectroscopy ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the major difference is the altitude where they occur , where for example the refractive boundary of an earth - sun analog is located above tropospheric clouds , significantly reducing the contrast of water features in the visible and near infrared ( @xcite ; @xcite , 2014 ; @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the location of a refractive boundary is easier to compute than that of a cloud top because the chemical species which contribute to an atmosphere s refractive properties are the same that contribute to its mean molecular weight , whereas the chemical nature of clouds are currently difficult to retrieve from the lightcurve of a transiting exoplanet . @xcite",
    "further shows that refraction modifies the rayleigh slope , and that it can break the degeneracy between retrieved abundances of chemical species and the planet s radius .",
    "nevertheless , a few recent papers use @xcite s formalism as a starting point for their own analytical derivations .",
    "@xcite interpret the strength of sodium and potassium lines of hd  189733b in term of vertical temperature gradients .",
    "@xcite explore the effects of a non - homogeneous limb distribution of vertically well - mixed hazes on an exoplanet s transmission spectrum .",
    "@xcite derives an index quantifying the haziness of an atmosphere from the contrast between the core and wings of sodium and potassium lines . @xcite",
    "erroneously apply @xcite s formalism to an atmosphere s sudden change in transmissive properties , due to the presence of a cloud base , to derive its purported signature .",
    "clearly , a new formalism which can also account for  surfaces \" ( surfaces , optically - thick cloud decks , or refractive boundaries ) is badly needed by the community .    in this paper , we derive the effective radius and the effective atmospheric thickness of a transiting exoplanet by proceeding along the line of @xcite s derivation .",
    "we highlight where our results differ from theirs , and show that we find an extra term which accounts for the presence of a  surface \" .",
    "we explore the various ramifications in terms of the location of the exoplanet s effective radius , its change with wavelength , and its effects on the rayleigh slope .",
    "we also discuss how  surfaces \" decrease the contrast of spectral features , and devise a figure of merit for characterizing the location of a  surface \" and a formalism for quickly estimating its impact on the spectral modulation of an atmosphere .",
    "finally , we develop a numerical recipe to generalize our formalism to atmospheres with a non - constant scale height and arbitrary sources of opacity .    ) between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the above picture is for a refractive atmosphere which bends rays , where @xmath13 is the grazing radius ( i.e. point of closest approach ) of a ray . in the non - refractive approximation",
    ", rays follow straight lines parallel to the dashed line and @xmath14 .",
    "[ newfig2 ] ]",
    "our derivation for an exoplanet s effective radius is similar to the one in the main article and the supplementary materials of @xcite .",
    "it is accurate for an atmosphere with a constant scale height , ignoring stellar limb darkening and second - order refractive effects .",
    "we highlight differences in results , as well as differences in notation when necessary .",
    "two quantities appear regularly throughout this paper : the impact parameter of a ray ( or projected distance to the center of the exoplanet with respect to the observer , @xmath15 ) , and the grazing radius of a ray ( or closest approach to the center of the exoplanet , @xmath13 ) .",
    "both quantities are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ newfig2 ] which shows the geometry of observation of a transiting exoplanet .",
    "even though we do not include the subtle secondary effects of refraction which creates differences between @xmath15 and @xmath13 , we use the appropriate quantities in the various equations as if refraction was fully included",
    ". however , throughout the discussions in this paper , @xmath15 and @xmath13 are interchangeable because they are identical in our essentially non - refractive treatment .",
    "nevertheless , one can include first - order  surface \" effects of refraction by locating the  surface \" at the impact parameter of the refractive critical boundary , whose location depends both on the properties of the atmosphere and the planet - star geometry @xcite .",
    "a transiting exoplanet causes a momentary drop ( @xmath16 ) in the observed stellar flux ( @xmath17 ) , which is expressed in term of the effective radius ( @xmath1 ) of the exoplanet which occults the stellar surface by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the observed fluxes outside of and in the middle of the transit , respectively , and @xmath21 is the stellar radius .",
    "strictly speaking , @xmath19 is the sum of the stellar flux and scattered radiation from a thin crescent - shaped region of the observable dayside of the exoplanet , as well as thermal emission from the nightside of the exoplanet .",
    "however , the exoplanet s contribution to the observed out - of - transit flux is negligible compared to the stellar flux @xcite .",
    "the effective radius of an exoplanet is the radius that a completely opaque spherical body occulting a uniformly bright star must have in order to duplicate the observed flux drop . ignoring stellar limb darkening , the effective radius of an exoplanet occulting the center of its host star is theoretically computed by @xmath22 @xcite where @xmath2 is the slant optical depth of a ray through the atmosphere , and @xmath23 and @xmath12 are the impact parameters of the ray at the  surface \" and the top of the atmosphere , respectively ( shown in fig .  [ newfig2 ] ) .",
    "the contribution to the effective radius ( i.e. to the flux drop ) is split between the completely opaque  body \" which lies below the  surface \" ( first term ) , and that of the semi - transparent atmosphere above it ( second term ) .",
    "we represent the atmospheric term by @xmath24 just like in @xcite , but replace their first term ( i.e. planetary radius at the surface , @xmath25 ) with @xmath11 .",
    "the effective atmospheric thickness ( @xmath26 ) is the difference between the effective radius of the exoplanet and the  surface \" , so that @xmath27 using equations  [ effradius ] and  [ effradius2 ] , we can relate @xmath24 to the effective atmospheric thickness by @xmath28 which has only one physical solution : @xmath29 we note the difference inside the square root between our expression and equation  6 in @xcite .",
    "their expression is erroneous because their units are not consistent .",
    "since @xmath30 is the ratio of the effective projected surfaces of the thin atmospheric annulus to that of the planetary body , we can usually expect that @xmath31 . in that case",
    ", we can rewrite equation  [ exacth ] as a taylor series and obtain @xmath32   \\notag \\\\     & \\approx \\frac{c}{2 b_s } \\left [ 1 - \\frac{1}{4 } ( c / b_s^2 ) + ... \\right ] \\label{effheight } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the series inside the square bracket is a correction factor which is close to and always less than one .",
    "the slant optical depth along the path of a ray depends on the nature of the opacity through the relationship of the absorption coefficient with number density , as well as the vertical distribution of the chemical species responsible for the stellar radiation s extinction . assuming a homogeneous atmosphere , such that the mole fraction ( @xmath33 ) of each species is constant with altitude , and that the absorption coefficient is proportional to number density ( e.g. rayleigh scattering ) , the slant optical depth ( @xmath34 ) is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the extinction cross section of each species",
    ", @xmath37 is the mean atmospheric cross section , and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is the column - integrated density along the path of the ray ( called horizontal integrated density by @xcite ) , or simply column abundance . in the case of collision - induced absorption ( cia ) , where the absorption coefficient is proportional to the square of the number density , the slant optical depth ( @xmath40 )",
    "is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the collision - induced cross - section of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 species , @xmath45 is the mean atmospheric collision - induced cross section , and @xmath46 is the square of the density integrated along the path of the ray .",
    "we adopt the same units as hitran @xcite for the collision - induced cross section , namely @xmath47 molecule@xmath48 .    in the case of an isothermal atmosphere , and assuming that the gravitational acceleration does not change much over the altitude regions which contribute significantly to an exoplanet s transmission spectrum , the neutral density ( @xmath49 ) through the atmosphere is related to its value ( @xmath50 ) at a reference radius ( @xmath51 ) by @xmath52 where the density scale height of the atmosphere ( @xmath53 ) is constant .",
    "since the absorption coefficient of various sources of opacity can have different dependences with number density , let us consider the general case where the absorption coefficient is proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "the integrated density to the @xmath55 power along the path of the ray ( @xmath56 ) is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a distance along the ray with respect to its grazing point .",
    "as already pointed out , @xmath59 for rayleigh scattering , and @xmath60 for cia .",
    "the situation for line transitions is more complicated as @xmath61 is equal to one near the core of the line and the far lorentzian wings , and goes up to two in the voigt - to - doppler transition region of the line ( see the comprehensive discussion in @xcite s supplementary materials ) .",
    "however , molecular bands are the sum of many overlapping individual transition lines , and we postulate that only the sides of bands , where the cross section is rapidly changing with wavelength , are dominated by this transition region . hence , most spectral regions of a molecular cross section should fall outside this region , and into the domain where @xmath61 is about one .",
    "provided no extra exponential term is hidden in @xmath58 , we can see by inspection that the exponential in equation  [ colabun2 ] is identical to that of a constant scale height atmosphere with a slant optical depth scale height ( @xmath62 ) , which we define by @xmath63 that is indeed the case in a non - refractive treatment , as the exponential dependence with @xmath53 then only comes from the density dependence , in opposition to the general case which is fairly complex ( see equations  32 and  17 , respectively , in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the solution to equation  [ colabun2 ] in our non - refractive treatment is simply the leading term in equation  43 of @xcite with @xmath62 replacing @xmath53 .",
    "it is then @xmath64 where we neglect the @xmath65 dependence ( @xmath66 ) as the variation of @xmath56 with altitude is dominated by the exponential factor .",
    "@xmath67 is simply @xmath56 where the grazing radius is the reference radius .    in general",
    ", the slant optical depth comes from a mixture of opacities with different @xmath62 , @xmath68 and the slant optical depth scale height will be between those of rayleigh scattering and cia ( i.e. @xmath61 is between one and two ) .",
    "moreover , the relative importance of cia opacities versus other opacities changes with altitude , so that @xmath62 might also change significantly with large changes in altitude . however , much of the discussions in the remainder of the paper assume that one form of opacity dominates in a given spectral region ( i.e. @xmath62 is constant with altitude ) .",
    "we treat the general case in section  [ integration ] .",
    "when @xmath62 is constant with altitude , it follows that @xmath69 where @xmath2 is given by either equation  [ opacity1 ] or  [ opacity2 ] depending on the opacity source , and @xmath70 is the slant optical depth at the reference radius . when selecting the  surface \" as the reference radius , the effective slant optical depth ( @xmath71 ) is by definition simply @xmath72 where @xmath6 is the slant optical depth at the  surface \" .",
    "to determine the effective atmospheric thickness , we must evaluate @xmath73 to solve this integral , we first use equation  [ slantdepth ] with the  surface \" as the reference radius , then replace @xmath13 with @xmath15 because of our non - refractive treatment ( see comments in section  [ derivation ] ) .",
    "we thus derive the relationships @xmath74 and @xmath75 which we use to change the integral variable from @xmath15 to @xmath2 .",
    "this leads to @xmath76 where @xmath77 as it is the slant optical depth at the top of the atmosphere .",
    "the second term is on the order of @xmath78 larger than the first term . since @xmath79 is usually much smaller than one , we neglect the second term .",
    "this term probably contributes to the departure of the effective slant optical depth from a constant when @xmath80 is small ( see fig .  1 of @xcite ) . however , we focus here on the domain which is applicable to the largest ensemble of exoplanets .      solving the integral in the first term of equation  [ intform ]",
    "is a multi - step process .",
    "the first step consists in splitting the integral by changing the limits of integration @xmath81 equation  [ split ] is true whether @xmath6 is larger or smaller than one . we then add and subtract identical integral terms to obtain @xmath82 where @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) is the euler - mascheroni constant , whose definition can be found in @xcite ( by inspection from equations  9 and 10 in appendix  1 ) and is @xmath85 we then rewrite the integral terms in equation  [ inter ] as @xmath86 the second term in equation  [ complex ] is trivial and simply @xmath87 .",
    "the last term is the exponential integral @xmath88 ( see equation  7 in appendix  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we get the very useful result that @xmath89    using this result in equation  [ intform ] , and combining it with equations  [ effradius ] or  [ effheight ] , we can see that to first - order the effective radius of an exoplanet is given by @xmath90 and the effective atmospheric thickness by @xmath91 we can compare our result for the effective atmospheric thickness to that in equation  7 of @xcite , noting that we use the symbol @xmath6 instead of @xmath92 , and @xmath62 instead of @xmath93 .",
    "we find our solutions are identical except that we have an extra term @xmath94 .",
    "what is the physical significance or interpretation of this term ?",
    "to understand the physical significance of our solution , we first rearrange the terms in equation  [ effatmthick ] into @xmath95 we then take the exponential on both sides and use equation  [ effslantdepth ] to get the very simple relation @xmath96 it is interesting to note that @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) is the effective slant optical depth associated with @xcite s solution which matches the simulations of @xcite for a clear atmosphere . however , our solution has an extra multiplicative factor which depends on the optical properties of the atmosphere at the  surface \" .",
    "does our solution matches their solution for a clear atmosphere ? a clear atmosphere can be thought of as an atmosphere with a  surface \" buried so deeply that it can not be observed ( i.e. @xmath99 ) . since @xmath100 ,",
    "our extra multiplicative factor is indeed one for a clear atmosphere .",
    ", at the effective exoplanet radius ) as a function of the slant optical depth of the atmosphere at the  surface \" ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "also shown are the clear atmosphere solution of @xcite ( triple - dot - dashed line ) and when the effective radius is located at the  surface \" ( dashed line ) . [ fig2 ] ]    fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the behaviour of @xmath71 with @xmath6 .",
    "as @xmath101 , @xmath71 asymptotically approaches the clear atmosphere solution of @xcite .",
    "below @xmath8 , @xmath71 diverges from this solution as @xmath6 decreases , and asymptotically approaches the  surface \" described by the  @xmath102 \" line .",
    "this makes sense because the effective radius is located at a slant optical depth within the bounds of the observable atmospheric region , i.e. above the  surface \" .",
    "thus , our extra integral exponential term from equation  [ effatmthick ] accounts for the effect of a  surface \" , and decreases the effective slant optical depth associated with the effective radius of the exoplanet .      how does this new result change the variation of the effective exoplanet radius with wavelength , originally discussed by @xcite ?",
    "assuming @xmath62 does not change much with wavelength , @xmath103 differentiation of the exponential integral gives @xmath104 so that @xmath105 as @xcite , we find that the size of spectral features depends on the nature of the opacity through @xmath62 , with cia spectral features proportional to half of the scale height ( see equation  [ sldepthscale ] ) .",
    "when the absorption coefficient is proportional to density , such as for rayleigh scattering , this reduces to @xmath106 because the cross section is the only quantity which is wavelength - dependent in the expression for the slant optical depth . for cia , we simply replace @xmath37 with @xmath45 ( see equation  [ opacity2 ] ) , and @xmath53 with @xmath107 ( see equation  [ sldepthscale ] ) .",
    "we find an extra multiplicative factor @xmath108 compared to @xcite .",
    "this holds true also for differentiation with respect to @xmath109 . for a clear atmosphere where @xmath6 tends to infinity",
    ", this extra factor tends to one .",
    "as @xmath6 tends to zero , this extra factor tends to @xmath6 and becomes vanishingly small .",
    "hence , the size of spectral features is not strictly proportional to the scale height , but also depends on the slant optical thickness of the atmosphere at the  surface \" , which can become vanishingly small when the  surface \" number density is low and the observable atmosphere is optically thin .",
    "similarly , this factor also modifies the rayleigh slope in spectral regions where rayleigh scattering dominates .",
    "as the rayleigh scattering cross section decreases from the ultraviolet to the infrared , so does its slant optical thickness . in spectral regions where the rayleigh scattering slant optical thickness is less than about four , the rayleigh slope decreases with wavelength until it becomes flat .",
    "the decrease of the contrast of spectral features has been demonstrated several times for both clouds and refraction through radiative transfer numerical simulations of exoplanetary transmission spectra ( see e. g. references in section  [ intro ] ) .",
    "however , the gradual change of the rayleigh slope in the visible and its flattening in the infrared was only recently shown @xcite numerically for jovian - type exoplanets .",
    "although @xcite and @xcite point out that the effects of refraction on transmission spectra are similar to clouds , we have now demonstrated analytically in sections  [ solution ] that all these  surfaces \" cause these same first - order effects .",
    "since the effective atmospheric thickness is proportional to the density scale height of the atmosphere , one quantity is particularly helpful in thinking about exoplanetary transmission spectra : the spectral modulation of an exoplanet .",
    "the spectral modulation is the difference in effective atmospheric thickness expressed in units of scale height @xmath110 where the subscripts  1 and  2 refers to two different wavelengths which are chosen such that @xmath111 .",
    "it is thus useful to also express the effective atmospheric thickness in units of scale height @xmath112 where @xmath61 is defined in section  [ opticaldepth ] ( see equations  [ colabun2 ] and  [ sldepthscale ] ) .    ) for @xmath59 ( see equations  [ colabun2 ] and  [ sldepthscale ] ) for different solutions : our solution , given by equation  [ hinscale ] ( solid line ) , @xcite s solution ( triple - dot - dashed line ) , and the approximation ( red line ) outlined in section  [ index ] .

    "[ fig3 ] shows how @xmath113 varies with @xmath6 for @xmath59 , both for our expression ( equation  [ hinscale ] ) and @xcite s ( or @xcite s ) . above @xmath8",
    ", there is no meaningful difference between the two solutions .",
    "as @xmath6 decreases , our solution for @xmath113 approaches the  surface \" without ever going below , unlike @xcite s solution which reaches the  surface \" when @xmath114 , and continues below at smaller  @xmath6 values .",
    "since rayleigh scattering cross sections continuously decrease with wavelength , these two solutions illustrate how the signature of rayleigh scattering changes with the presence of a  surface \" ( see also figs .  1 - 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the significance of the difference between the two solutions is also evident when considering its impact on the spectral modulation of molecular absorption , which we can infer from fig .",
    "let us consider a single line transition where @xmath115 at the core of the line .",
    "in the presence of a  surface \" , the spectral modulation between the core and the wing of the line is never greater than about @xmath116 , irrespective of the value of @xmath6 in the wings of the line .",
    "however , it can be much larger with @xcite s solution ( e.g. about 6.9 with the @xmath117 part of the wing ) .",
    "hence , a  surface \" decreases the atmosphere s spectral modulation .",
    "we can derive this analytically by combining equations  [ specmod ] and  [ hinscale ] .",
    "it requires an assumption about the nature of the dominant form of opacity ( i.e. about the value of @xmath61 ) at each of the two wavelengths that we are comparing .",
    "when @xmath61 is the same at both wavelengths , the spectral modulation simplifies to @xmath118 \\label{sizefeatures}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 .",

    "their results hinge upon getting the proper estimate of the density scale height to translate an observed spectral flux difference into a spectral modulation , and comparing it to that of the corresponding species in a clear isothermal atmosphere .    the theoretical contrast ratio between the  surface \" case and the clear case , or  surface \"- to - clear spectral modulation ratio ( @xmath131 ) , is given by @xmath132 and @xmath133 . in the more general case",

    "[ fig4 ] ]      although useful for computing transmission spectra of isothermal well - mixed atmospheres , equation  [ hinscale ] does not provide a quick understanding of which spectral features rise above the continuum created by a  surface \" , because exponential integrals fall outside the realm of our intuition .",
    "we can get around this problem with a simple approximation : we first characterize the location of the  surface \" in term of an equivalent mean atmospheric cross section , or  surface \" cross section ( @xmath136 for @xmath59 ) within the context of a clear atmosphere , and then define this  surface \" cross section to be the minimum mean cross section which can be observed in the atmosphere .    to determine this",
    " surface \" cross section , we ask the question :  what mean atmospheric cross section in a clear atmosphere produces an effective atmospheric thickness at the  surface\"?. it is mathematically equivalent to setting @xmath102 , which in a clear atmosphere becomes @xmath137 and gives @xmath138 in our non - refractive treatment . the number density at the  surface \" is converted into a mean cross section which is constant at all wavelengths , and which depends on the properties of the exoplanet through its radius ( @xmath11 ) and its scale height .",
    "we then set to @xmath136 any part of the mean cross section which is less than this ",
    "surface \" cross section thereby hiding spectral features located below this continuum .",
    "we can then do a quick  back - of - the - envelope \" calculation of the effective atmospheric thickness , using this modified mean cross section ( @xmath139 ) , by using equation  [ sizefeatures ] for a clear atmosphere @xmath140 the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] depicts our approximation , which follows the solution of @xcite when @xmath141 , and is zero otherwise .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the amount by which our approximation underestimates the effective atmospheric thickness .",
    "it is at most @xmath142 when @xmath143 .",
    "we can apply the same line of reasoning to quickly determine which cia features rise above the  surface \" continuum .",
    "we use @xmath144 instead of equation  [ approxs ] , where @xmath145 is the modified mean collision - induced cross section with its minimum set at the  surface \" collision - induced cross section ( @xmath146 ) , given by @xmath147 we then determine the spectral modulation between any two spectral regions with equation  [ specmod ] .",
    "the  surface \" decreases the spectral modulation only if @xmath148 or @xmath149 in one of the two spectral regions .",
    "can we use this approximation to quickly determine the location of a  surface \" from observations ?",
    "if the observed spectral modulation is due to a single species and is less than that expected in a clear atmosphere , we can relate the observed spectral modulation , @xmath150 , with respect to a local maximum in its cross section ( @xmath36 ) by @xmath151 unfortunately , the  surface \" location can not be unambiguously determined because the mole fraction ( @xmath33 ) of the species is unknown .",
    "indeed , equation  [ abuneffect ] shows that the spectral modulation of a species increases with abundance in the presence of a  surface \" , as demonstrated numerically by @xcite for a refractive boundary .",
    "the only way to break this degeneracy are two - fold : either the spectral signature is that of a major species ( i.e. @xmath152 ) and we can determine the location of the  surface \" , or we can predict the location of the  surface \" and then determine the abundance of the minor species . given that refractive boundaries are dependent on the bulk properties of the exoplanetary atmosphere as well as the planet - star geometry , quantities which are retrieved during the analysis of transit data , location of refractive boundaries can be predicted in principle and used to place a lower limit on the abundance of detected minor species @xcite .",
    "although the analytical approximation outlined in this section is intended to build physical intuition about the effects of  surfaces \" , it does not produce large differences in the computed transmission spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) compared with the exact solution embodied by equation  [ hinscale ] .",
    "its most obvious artifacts are sharp changes in the slope of the effective atmospheric thickness with @xmath6 ( see red line in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) , i.e. with wavelength , similar to those which are produced by the analytical model of @xcite ( see their figs .  11 and  12 ) in the transition from rayleigh scattering to cloud - dominated spectral regions .",
    "however , to compute transmission spectra with the proper gradual change of slope with wavelength , characteristic of the presence of a  surface \" , it is necessary to use our exact analytical solution .",
    "although applicable only to an homogeneous isothermal atmosphere , our analytical formalism can be generalized to any atmosphere .",
    "indeed , equation  [ results ] suggests a way to compute the effective radius from a set of numerically - computed slant optical depth ( @xmath153 ) at various impact parameters ( @xmath154 ) . to achieve this",
    ", we first divide the atmosphere into @xmath155 layers , so that @xmath156 where @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "we can choose the impact parameter bounding the various layers ( @xmath154 ) so that the slant optical depth scale height is roughly constant in each layer .",
    "in this case , it is given by @xmath159 where the indices @xmath160 and @xmath161 refer to the upper and the lower boundaries of each layer , respectively .",
    "we need make no assumption about the nature of the opacity as we derive the slant optical depth scale height directly from the results of numerical integration , which can combine arbitrary sources of opacities .",
    "instead of using @xmath6 as our reference slant optical depth for the change of variable ( see equation  [ varchange ] ) , we use the average of the slant optical depth at the boundaries of each layer ( @xmath162 ) , or simply @xmath163 the change of variable then becomes @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the impact parameter whose slant optical depth equals  @xmath162 .",
    "the effective radius then becomes @xmath166    one advantage to choosing @xmath162 as a reference , is that @xmath167 is positive over half of the range of slant optical depth within a layer , and negative over the other half , so that the integral in the third term of equation  [ genint ] is close to zero .",
    "combined with the fact that the factor in front of the third term is a factor of @xmath168 larger than the second term , and that this factor is generally much smaller than one , the third term is completely negligible .",
    "we can then use equation  [ results ] to solve the integral in the second term , and obtain @xmath169 \\notag \\\\    & \\approx b_s^2 + 2 \\sum_{l = 0}^{m-1 } ( b_{l+1 } - b_l ) b_{0l } \\left ( 1 - \\left <   e^{-\\tau } \\right>_l \\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath170 is the atmospheric transmission averaged over the @xmath171 atmospheric layer . the effective atmospheric thickness",
    "is then given by @xmath172 \\notag \\\\   & \\approx \\sum_{l = 0}^{m-1 } ( b_{l+1 } - b_l ) \\left ( \\frac{b_{0l}}{b_s } \\right ) \\left ( 1 - \\left <   e^{-\\tau } \\right>_l",
    "\\right )    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath173 is generally close to but larger than one .",
    "our generalized vertical integration scheme is applicable to arbitrary changes of the number density with impact parameter , whether it is due to a change in the mixture of types of opacity or change in density scale height . since it only requires a series of slant optical depths computed at various impact parameters , the complexity of the physics which is included in the transmission spectrum ( e.g. changing gravity with altitude , arbitrary temperature profile , collision - induced absorption , etc . )",
    "is only limited by the complexity of the radiative transfer code which computes the slant optical depths .",
    "we have derived analytical expressions to compute the effective radius , the effective atmospheric thickness , and the spectral modulation of transiting exoplanets for any source of opacity ( rayleigh scattering , molecular absorption , and collision - induced absorption ) .",
    "our analytical expressions assume that the atmosphere has a constant density scale height , and ignore stellar limb darkening and second - order refractive effects , just as the analytical expressions by @xcite and @xcite do .",
    "however , unlike those previous expressions , our analytical expressions include the effects of a sharp change in flux (  surface \" ) which exists on all planets and is due to an actual surface , an optically thick cloud deck , or a refractive boundary .",
    "we find that the spectral modulation of an exoplanet depends on the nature of the opacity source via its effect on the slant optical depth scale height of the atmosphere .",
    "we thus confirm that collision - induced absorption have half the effective scale height as rayleigh scattering @xcite .",
    "more importantly , we also find that the effective radius of an exoplanet is located at a slant optical depth which varies with the location of the  surface \" .",
    "for a clear atmosphere , our solution matches that of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , as the number density , or the slant optical depth , at the  surface \" decreases , the effective radius of the exoplanet asymptotically approaches the  surface \" without going below , unlike @xcite and @xcite s solutions .",
    "our analytical formalism explains many of the effects of clouds and refraction on transmission spectra that have been previously discussed through numerical simulations .",
    "it explains the changing slope of the rayleigh scattering feature with wavelength first noted by @xcite for refraction",
    ". it also explains why clouds and refraction decrease the contrast of spectral features ( e. g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the fact that the spectral modulation of the atmosphere increases with the abundance of chemical species @xcite .",
    "our formalism also shows that these effects are a common signature of all  surfaces \" , which create a sharp boundary below which stellar radiation is cut - off .",
    "we have also introduced the concept of a  surface \" cross section which is the minimum mean atmospheric cross section of a homogeneous atmosphere which can be observed given the location of the  surface \" .",
    "this allows us to quickly determine the expected spectral modulation of a species , with less than 0.5 scale height error , given the species s abundance and its peak in cross section .",
    "@xcite recently proposed several indices linked to the spectral modulation of sodium , potassium , and water features to quantify the cloudiness of exoplanets .",
    "however , he also points out that they lack universality because each of them are wavelength - specific , and may be affected differently by clouds , presumably because of opacity differences with wavelength .",
    "our concept of a  surface \" cross section is more general precisely because it is wavelength - independent .",
    "although much of the discussions in this paper assumes a constant slant optical depth scale height atmosphere , we also developed a numerical recipe to generalize our formalism to atmospheres with non - constant scale heights , as well as those with any mixture of opacity sources .",
    "our general formalism thus allows one to compute the effective radius and the effective atmospheric thickness of an exoplanet with a  surface \" , ignoring the effects of stellar limb darkening , from a set of slant optical depths computed numerically at various impact parameters .",
    "given that all exoplanets have  surfaces \" , our formalism is a crucial step toward the understanding and interpretation of exoplanetary transmission spectra .",
