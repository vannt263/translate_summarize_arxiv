    "a problem fundamental to the study of nonlinear partial differential equations ( pde s ) is the nature of their singularities .",
    "perhaps the most famous ( and unsolved ) problem is the suspected blow - up of the derivatives of the velocity field in the three - dimensional euler equation @xcite .",
    "shocks , i.e. , discontinuities in the velocity , are the type of singularities displayed by the one - dimensional inviscid burgers equation @xcite .",
    "still a different type of singularity has to be expected from three - dimensional free surface flow , which we will consider here .",
    "a similar study of a two - dimensional flow has been conducted recently @xcite .",
    "surface tension will tend to make the surface as small as possible by reducing the radius .",
    "the classical stability analysis of an infinite cylinder of fluid by rayleigh @xcite shows that the radius does not decrease uniformly : due to the constraint of mass conservation the fastest growing mode is the one with wavelength @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the radius of the cylinder .",
    "consequently , the fluid cylinder will decay into drops of roughly that size .",
    "once the radius becomes zero locally , i.e. the original column of fluid separates , the description in terms of a radius function breaks down .",
    "hence the equations must develop a singularity at that point .",
    "although linear stability analysis gives a reasonable estimate of the size of the droplets formed , it completely fails to predict the shape of the surface once an appreciable deformation of the original cylinder is reached @xcite .",
    "for example it does not explain the fact that the cylinder does not break up uniformly .",
    "rather , regular size drops are , under most circumstances , followed by much smaller `` satellite drops '' . even higher order perturbation theory @xcite gives only a qualitative prediction of the unequal drop sizes , but is not able to describe the shape of the fluid anywhere close to pinch - off .",
    "this is not very surprising , because the characteristic time of the linear instability is close to the time distance from the singularity , where expansions in the radius and the velocity are bound to break down .",
    "therefore a complete treatment of the nonlinearities is needed . the full navier - stokes equation with free boundary conditions",
    "is extremely complicated , for both analytical and numerical studies .",
    "the only simulations of axisymmetric drops we are aware of were restricted to irrotational , inviscid flow @xcite .",
    "but even with this restriction simulations close to the singularity become extremely costly , since the neck region requires high resolution . a reduction of the problem to one dimension",
    "will give huge savings in computer time , making closeups of the singularity possible .",
    "there already exist some one - dimensional equations for axisymmetric free surface flow @xcite .",
    "lee @xcite only considers the inviscid case .",
    "bogy s equations @xcite allow for dissipation but are very complicated in structure and do not have a clear connection with the original navier - stokes equation .",
    "we will therefore derive a set of one - dimensional equations by expanding the radial variable in a taylor series and keeping only the lowest order terms of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "several invariances and conservation laws of the navier - stokes equation are preserved",
    ". this will be the subject of the second section , along with a linear stability analysis .",
    "integrating the equations near the singularity proves to be very difficult , since the problem becomes very stiff due to the large range of length scales in the problem .",
    "we develop a fully implicit centered difference method .",
    "this scheme is then modified to treat the convection term @xmath2 by an upwinding technique which ensures negative definiteness of the numerical dissipation .",
    "the numerical scheme is detailed in section three .",
    "there is a fair amount of work applying one - dimensional equations to the breakup of jets @xcite , liquid bridges @xcite or hanging drops @xcite .",
    "there is also work in this spirit on films lining a cylindrical tube @xcite .",
    "yet a detailed comparison between experiments and one - dimensional models within the nonlinear regime is missing .",
    "therefore , we try to compare experimental drop profiles with simulations close to the breakup point .",
    "this is found in section four for two recent experiments .",
    "the first experiment @xcite examines the decay of a free jet of water , the second observes how a hanging drop detaches after it is adiabatically filled out of an orifice @xcite .",
    "we also produce an example with a high viscosity fluid .",
    "simulations and experiments agree very well , giving ample support to the idea that droplet breakup can be well described by one - dimensional equations .    in the next section",
    "we take a closer look at the pinch region .",
    "we discuss a similarity theory for the nonviscous case and explain its failure .",
    "all viscous solutions are determined by universal scaling functions close to the pinch point .",
    "the concluding section briefly discusses the approximation used in relation to other types of approximations , its higher order versions , and the full navier - stokes or euler equations .",
    "finally , we indicate directions of future research .",
    "we start from the navier - stokes equation for an axisymmetric column of fluid with kinematic viscosity @xmath3 , density @xmath4 , and surface tension @xmath5 . in cylindrical",
    "coordinates it reads @xcite    @xmath6    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the velocity along the axis , @xmath9 the velocity in the radial direction , and @xmath10 the pressure .",
    "the acceleration of gravity @xmath11 points in negative z - direction .",
    "the continuity equation reads    @xmath12    the equations ( [ ( 2.2 ) ] ) and ( [ ( 2.3 ) ] ) hold for @xmath13 .",
    "the balance of normal forces gives    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the stress tensor , @xmath16 the outward normal , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the principal radii of curvature .",
    "the tangential force balance is    @xmath19    explicitly , this gives    @xmath20 \\\\",
    "= \\frac{\\gamma}{\\rho}(1/r_1 + 1/r_2)|_{r = h}\\ ] ]    for the normal forces , and    @xmath21 = 0|_{r = h}\\ ] ]    for the tangential forces .",
    "the prime refers to differentiation with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "finally , the surface has to move with the velocity field at the boundary :    @xmath23    since we are going to look at thin columns of fluid relative to their elongation , we expand in a taylor series with respect to @xmath24 . by symmetry",
    "we get    @xmath25    and ( [ ( 2.3 ) ] ) is satisfied by choosing @xmath9 to be    @xmath26    the pressure is expanded in the same way :    @xmath27    we now insert ( [ ( 2.9)])-([(2.100 ) ] ) into ( [ ( 2.1 ) ] ) , ( [ ( 2.2 ) ] ) , and ( [ ( 2.6)])-([(2.8 ) ] ) and solve the equations to lowest order in @xmath24 . in the case of ( [ ( 2.2 ) ] ) this gives    @xmath28    equation ( [ ( 2.1 ) ] ) is identically satisfied to lowest order .",
    "remembering that @xmath29 is also of order @xmath24 we get from ( [ ( 2.6 ) ] ) an expression for the pressure @xmath30 in ( [ ( 2.11 ) ] ) :    @xmath31    similarly , ( [ ( 2.7 ) ] ) gives an expression involving @xmath32 :    @xmath33    equations ( [ ( 2.12 ) ] ) and ( [ ( 2.13 ) ] ) can be used to eliminate @xmath30 and @xmath32 from ( [ ( 2.11 ) ] ) giving    @xmath34    the surface condition ( [ ( 2.8 ) ] ) says to lowest order    @xmath35    the formula for the mean curvature @xmath36 of a body of revolution is known from differential geometry @xcite .",
    "thus , dropping the index on @xmath37 and denoting the surface tension contribution of the pressure by @xmath10 , we finally get    @xmath38 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath39    here the index @xmath22 refers to differentiation with respect to @xmath22 . when solving the set of equations ( [ ( 2.16 ) ] ) , ( [ ( 2.17 ) ] ) for @xmath40 $ ] we impose the boundary conditions    @xmath41    and    @xmath42    the set of equations ( [ ( 2.16 ) ] )  ( [ ( 2.19 ) ] ) is going to concern us for the rest of this paper .",
    "we reiterate that the physical velocity field ( [ ( 2.9 ) ] ) , ( [ ( 2.10 ) ] ) described by ( [ ( 2.16 ) ] ) , ( [ ( 2.17 ) ] ) has both radial and longitudinal components with a nontrivial r - dependence . the physical pressure ( [ ( 2.100 ) ] )",
    "also carries contributions from the shear stress .",
    "this should be born in mind when we refer to @xmath43 and @xmath10 in ( [ ( 2.16 ) ] ) , ( [ ( 2.17 ) ] ) as `` velocity '' and `` pressure '' .",
    "there are two important conservation laws for this simplified system .",
    "first , mass conservation means    @xmath44    @xmath45    second the sum of the kinetic energy @xmath46 and the potential energy    @xmath47    obeys the balance equation @xmath48 so , apart from boundary terms the total energy changes with the rate of energy dissipation    @xmath49    since @xmath50 is negative definite , it follows that , without external driving ( boundary terms in ( [ ( 2.25 ) ] ) ) , the total energy can only decrease .",
    "note that the potential energy for the full equations is precisely ( [ ( 2.24 ) ] ) , so that the exact surfaces of static equilibrium are also equilibrium surfaces of the model : they are states which minimize @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "famous examples are the equilibrium shapes of pendant drops @xcite .",
    "this was the reason for keeping lower order terms in the expression for @xmath10 : in a consistent expansion by orders of r the expression for @xmath10 simply would have been @xmath52 resulting in a different form of the potential energy .",
    "we also note that @xmath50 is _ not _ negative definite for the viscous term as cited by cram @xcite .",
    "his term @xmath53 may feed energy into the fluid , which we found to prevent the system from reaching an equilibrium state .    although of limited applicability in practice , it is instructive to repeat the stability analysis for a fluid cylinder in the case of our model .",
    "assume a cylinder of radius @xmath1 receives a sinusoidal perturbation of wavelength ; then    @xmath54,\\\\   v(z , t ) & = & \\varepsilon(t)v_0 sin(kz).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    assuming @xmath55 , ( [ ( 2.16 ) ] ) and ( [ ( 2.17 ) ] ) give to lowest order in @xmath56    @xmath57 and    @xmath58 respectively .",
    "this leaves us with the dispersion relation    @xmath59    the solution of ( [ ( 2.29 ) ] ) is    @xmath60    where    @xmath61    is a viscous length scale .",
    "both the limits of zero viscosity ,    @xmath62    and high viscosity ,    @xmath63    coincide with the exact result @xcite if an expansion to lowest order in @xmath64 is made .",
    "equation ( [ ( 2.30 ) ] ) shows that there is an instability for long wavelengths , the stability boundary being @xmath65 independent of @xmath3 . in the case of a random disturbance , however , the relevant quantity is the _ most unstable _ or fastestest growing mode . in the general case",
    "this is @xmath66 for @xmath67 , the most unstable wavelength is therefore @xmath68 instead of the exact value of @xmath69 @xcite . in the limit of very high viscosity",
    "the infinite wavelength perturbation becomes the most unstable one .",
    "the numerical approximations were computed using a rather simple finite difference scheme .",
    "the spatial mesh is highly nonuniform , graded mesh ; its refinement is based on the behavior of the computed solution .",
    "the time - integration method is an adaptive fully implicit @xmath70-weighted scheme .",
    "let the space mesh be @xmath71 and adopt the following notation : @xmath72 the meshes used were always constrained to satisfy @xmath73    the solution at each time level is defined by two arrays , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ; the quantity @xmath76 is the value of the approximate radius @xmath77 at the mesh point @xmath78 and the value @xmath79 gives the value of the approximate velocity @xmath43 at the point @xmath80 . in describing the discrete equations for a particular time step",
    "it is convenient to let @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the changes in @xmath79 and @xmath76 , respectively , that take place over the step .",
    "difference analogs of the @xmath43-equation , ( [ ( 2.16 ) ] ) , were written corresponding to each point @xmath80 and the difference analogs of the @xmath77-equation , ( [ ( 2.17 ) ] ) , were written for each @xmath78 .",
    "the time derivative term was approximated by @xmath83 or @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the relation for @xmath10 was used to define it at each point @xmath78 in terms of @xmath77 at @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , using centered differences for the @xmath88 term and a second difference for @xmath89 .",
    "( near the bottom of a pendant drop this was changed ; see the remarks just after ( [ ( 4.1 ) ] ) . )",
    "this defines @xmath10 at each time level in terms of @xmath77 at that level .    in setting up the difference equations that mimic ( [ ( 2.16 ) ] ) and ( [ ( 2.17 ) ] ) the spatial terms ( everything except the time derivative terms )",
    "are evaluated using a weighted average of the current value and the yet - to - be - computed value .",
    "these `` mid - step '' values can be written as @xmath90 and @xmath91 . with @xmath92",
    "this gives a second order correct in time difference equation , but we used @xmath70 slightly larger than @xmath93 ( typically @xmath94 ) . using @xmath70 close to one",
    "half gives a small first order truncation term ( say 10% of the first - order backward difference equation ) .",
    "taking @xmath95 gives smoother discrete solutions than @xmath92 .",
    "the approximation of the @xmath96 term at @xmath80 is done as follows : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the numerical viscosity term that `` upwinds '' this nonlinear convective term .",
    "the @xmath98 is structured so that it is an energy dissipation term of small size ; the usual technique of simply skewing the difference equation in the direction that the fluid is coming from does not assure such a property .",
    "the @xmath98 term that we use is a difference analog of @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 is a nonnegative parameter .",
    "specifically , @xmath102 the rest of the @xmath43-equation formed as central differences .",
    "note associating @xmath10 with the @xmath78 s gives @xmath103 at the @xmath80 points .",
    "the viscosity term in ( [ ( 2.16 ) ] ) is very similar to the nvt term ; the @xmath104-term is just the constant @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath77-equation at @xmath78 has two spatial terms .",
    "the first , @xmath105 , is approximated by .",
    "the second , @xmath106 , is approximated by @xmath107    in solving the nonlinear difference equations we use newton s method .",
    "many of our simulations used only one newton step per time step , starting from an initial guess based on linear extrapolation from the previous two time levels .",
    "it is quite easy , and reasonably efficient , to control the time step in such a way that one step of newton s method reduces the error to very close to rounding error .",
    "it is worthwhile pointing out that even if the decision is made to only use one step of newton s method it is useful to code it in general , since observing quadratic convergence of the iteration is a good check on whether the linearization has been done correctly .",
    "the first experiment we consider studies the breakup of a liquid jet @xcite .",
    "water is pumped through a nozzle at high speed to form a liquid column virtually unaffected by gravity . a periodic perturbation , whose amplitude and frequency can be controlled , is applied to the jet as it leaves the nozzle , the system is allowed to reach a steady state , in which the jet at a sufficiently large distance from the nozzle has completely broken up into droplets .",
    "photographs of this stationary configuration are taken .",
    "we try to model the experiment as closely as possible , but since we can only simulate up to the point of the first singularity ( due to limitations of our current program ) we can not reach the stationary state . instead , we fix @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and over a period of 8 wavelengths smoothly turn on a small sinusoidal perturbation to @xmath110 .",
    "thus the parameters of the simulation are the length of the jet @xmath111 , its initial radius @xmath1 , the fluid parameters @xmath112 and @xmath3 , the speed of the jet @xmath113 , and the amplitude @xmath114 and frequency @xmath115 of the perturbation .",
    "we chose @xmath116 , so the size of the drops is very small compared with the jet length and the precise value of this ratio is immaterial .",
    "@xmath114 was adjusted to make breakup times conform with experiment .",
    "the remaining dimensionless parameters controlling the problem are @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and the weber number @xmath119 . here",
    "@xmath120 is the wavelength of the perturbation and @xmath121 the viscous length ( [ ( 2.31 ) ] ) .",
    "typical values for fluid parameters can be found in table 1 .",
    "the jet experiments were done with water .",
    "for the jet , the linearized problem of section 2 now takes place in a semi - infinite geometry , where surface perturbations are prohibited to the left of the nozzle opening @xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , for large weber numbers ( 239 in the present experiment ) the growth of unstable modes is just the same as the temporal growth of section 2 , translated into space via the jet velocity @xmath113 .",
    "also , the parabolic velocity profile of the nozzle opening has relaxed into a plug profile in the relevant region of the jet @xcite , so we are assuming a constant profile right from the opening .",
    "we follow the simulation up to the first singularity .",
    "the resulting profile is aligned with a picture of the experimental jet , to make the minima in front of the drop which is about to detach coincide . in figure 1",
    "theoretical and experimental profiles are compared for @xmath122 .",
    "the case with the smallest perturbation is shown @xcite .",
    "allowing for some blur of the photographs , the agreement in the shape of the drop about to form is quite nice .",
    "note that the breakup is taking place in a very asymmetric fashion ( with respect to the breakup point ) : on the right side the profile is quite steep forming a very much rounded drop ; on the other side a flat neck formed , which will eventually coalesce into a smaller satellite drop .",
    "an even more direct comparison is possible with an experiment investigating a dripping tap @xcite .",
    "as long as the drop is small , it will be suspended stably from the orifice . by slowly filling in more liquid",
    ", the drop goes through a series of stable states , until eventually gravity overcomes surface tension and the lower half of the drop falls .",
    "subsequently , a thin neck forms and the lower part of the drop detaches .",
    "the stability of the drop hanging in equilibrium has been the subject of much study in itself @xcite . the length scale controlling",
    "this problem is the capillary length @xmath123 for water , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , the viscous length , are separated by almost five orders of magnitude , see table 1 .",
    "hence there is a wide range of physical phenomena to explore between the onset of the linear instability and the breakup of the drop .",
    "we will not repeat the stability analysis for our one - dimensional equations here , but concentrate on the breakup .",
    "the only dimensionless parameters in the problem are the ratios @xmath126 and @xmath127 , where @xmath1 is the radius of the orifice .",
    "they were made to coincide with the experimental values , the working fluid being water .",
    "there are some technical problems involved in simulating the moving boundary at the lower end of the drop .",
    "we avoid having to use a movable grid by mapping the problem on the unit interval , @xmath128 $ ] where @xmath129 is the length of the drop which is calculated using    @xmath130    by definition , @xmath131 is the velocity of the lower boundary .",
    "care must also be taken to calculate the pressure at the endpoint where @xmath88 becomes infinite .",
    "for the values @xmath132 $ ] we calculate @xmath10 by interpolating @xmath133 with an _ even _ fourth - order polynomial",
    ". then all the singularities in the mean curvature cancel .",
    "figure 2 shows a series of profiles taken at constant time intervals of @xmath134 . in the experiment",
    ", this would correspond to @xmath135 .",
    "given the very small time scale it would be very costly to let fluid drip as slowly as is possible in experiments . to still let initial oscillations die out , the viscosity is set to a very high value initially , and is then reduced to the value of water well before the first instability .",
    "fluid is injected at the orifice with speed @xmath136 . to the profiles at constant time intervals we add a snapshot of the drop as the width of the neck becomes @xmath137 .",
    "we also superimpose an experimental picture of the drop @xcite , taken at the point of breakup .    the very good agreement with simulations",
    "is especially impressive since this was not to be expected from a simple one - dimensional approximation . in particular in the lower half of the drop",
    "the assumption @xmath138 seems to fail , but one must remember that this part of the drop is almost static in a moving frame of reference .",
    "but the static limit of the equations is retained exactly in the approximation . note",
    "that although the linear instability of the hanging drop is not investigated explicitly , it is also accurately described by the model .",
    "namely , it determines the total volume of the drop ( upper and lower half combined ) and influences the point of breakoff .",
    "again , the breakoff occurs very asymmetrically , as was already observed in the jet decay .",
    "the asymmetry therefore does _ not _ come from the action of gravity .",
    "this is also confirmed by the estimate of peregrine et al .",
    "@xcite , who estimate that by the time the neck is formed , straining forces due to surface tension outweigh the straining forces due to gravity .",
    "we conclude this section by reporting on a simulation of a fluid with significantly higher viscosity . with the radius of the orifice being 0.06 cm , we adjusted @xmath126 and @xmath127 to match the parameter values for glycerol at @xmath139 , as given in table 1 .",
    "the viscosity of glycerol is about 1,000 times higher than that of water , leading to a very different type of dynamics .",
    "figure 3 shows the neck being pulled into a long and thin thread .",
    "its length is 40 times the radius of the orifice at the point of rupture .",
    "qualitatively , this is consistent with linear stability analysis : for high viscosity , the most unstable wavelength becomes large , see equation ( [ ( 2.32 ) ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the radius @xmath1 of the thread becomes very small , so ( [ ( 2.32 ) ] ) can not account for its length in any quantitative way .",
    "the origin is clearly dynamical .",
    "the break occurs at the upper end of the thread in the simulation presented , but it may also happen close to the drop under slightly different conditions . experiments with high viscosity fluids in the same geometry are in in progress @xcite .",
    "we now look closer at the point where the fluid neck is pinching off .",
    "as the radius goes to zero , pressure forces are expected to diverge , and the small amount of fluid left in the neck region is pressed out of it even faster . therefore , as @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the minimum radius , the velocity and higher derivatives of both @xmath77 and @xmath43 will probably become infinite at the point of rupture .",
    "this is the singularity or `` blow up '' we want to investigate further .",
    "keller and miksis @xcite present a very interesting scaling theory for the singularity in the nonviscous case .",
    "there are two important differences between our problem and theirs : their geometry is two - dimensional rather than three - dimensional - axisymmetric , and they study the time _ after _ the breakup .",
    "the idea of their study may be described as follows : since @xmath77 becomes very small near the singularity and @xmath43 large , the pinch region is separated in scale from the boundaries . therefore boundary conditions become irrelevant and the flow is determined by @xmath112 alone . if @xmath142 represents the time distance from the singularity , the only available length scale is the combination @xmath143 .",
    "hence , introducing    @xmath144    where @xmath145 is the position of the pinch point , and    @xmath146    the problem can be written in terms of the similarity variables @xmath147 , and @xmath148 alone .",
    "once the similarity equation is solved , the resulting profile determines the evolution of the interface for all times up to the singularity .",
    "note that @xmath149 and @xmath150 as @xmath151 if @xmath152 and @xmath153 are assumed fixed , consistent with the original assumptions .",
    "we will see , however , that this similarity argument does not carry through for the case of our equations , since the inviscid case appears to develop singularities even before @xmath140 ! for a consistent formulation up to the point of breakup we therefore need to add at least a small amount of viscosity .",
    "we are confident that the following conjecture , due to constantin @xcite , is true .",
    "it indicates that with viscosity the singularity does not occur until @xmath141 goes to zero .    for @xmath154 and @xmath155 $ ] such that @xmath156 the solutions of ( [ ( 2.16 ) ] ) , ( [ ( 2.17 ) ] ) stay regular , i.e. , @xmath77 , @xmath43 , and all their derivatives remain bounded in @xmath157 $ ] for @xmath158 $ ] with bounds depending only on @xmath3 and @xmath159 .    to investigate the problem further , we chose a cylinder of radius @xmath160 and length @xmath161 as an initial condition .",
    "at its ends @xmath162 the radius is kept fixed and the velocity is set to zero . given a slight initial disturbance in the velocity field , the cylinder collapses and forms a singularity after about @xmath163 .",
    "the viscous length is @xmath164 .",
    "the profile near the singularity comes out quite asymmetric , as observed before .",
    "this is also true if one starts from initial data almost symmetric around @xmath165 .",
    "two almost linear pieces of different slope are joined smoothly by a round piece with a radius of curvature comparable to the minimum radius , cf .",
    "hence both terms in the pressure in ( [ ( 2.16 ) ] ) are of the same order of magnitude at the minimum , while the first term dominates the linear regime away from the minimum .",
    "this means the pressure is higher on the shallow side of the minimum ( right hand side in figure 4 ) , forcing fluid over to the steeper side ( left hand side in figure 4 ) .",
    "as seen by comparing with the velocities in figure 4 , the minimum is convected with the velocity of the fluid , so in the frame of reference of the minimum fluid is expelled on either side . at the same time this causes the left hand side to get even steeper .",
    "if there is no mechanism curbing this process , the slope will eventually get infinite .",
    "all our simulations , conducted with different initial radii and initial disturbances , show that for the inviscid equations exactly this happens and @xmath88 goes to infinity _ even before _",
    "@xmath141 goes to zero .",
    "note that @xmath121 is still less than 2 % of the minimum height in figure 4 , yet the inviscid equations already would have blown up at the times shown .",
    "if @xmath3 is finite , on the other hand , @xmath88 turns out to be uniformly bounded by a constant which gets larger as @xmath3 decreases .",
    "hence for finite , but arbitrarily small @xmath3 blow - up only occurs for @xmath140 .    from the conjecture mentioned",
    "earlier we conclude that viscous solutions , up to some finite minimum radius @xmath159 , can be well approximated by finite differences as long as the mesh is fine enough .",
    "intuitively , one expects that the mesh size @xmath166 should be at least of the order of @xmath159 .",
    "we checked convergence near the singularity by conducting a series of runs with increasingly fine resolution . to save on computational effort , only the region around the singularity",
    "is highly resolved , the grid getting coarser by factors of 2 towards the outside .",
    "we plotted @xmath141 and the maximum velocity @xmath167 versus the time difference from the singularity on logarithmic scales , see figure 5 .",
    "lengths are shown in units of @xmath121 and times in units of the viscous time scale @xmath168 the plots agree up to the length scale of the coarser grid .",
    "we also monitored the highest derivatives in the problem , i. e. @xmath103 and @xmath169 .",
    "the dashed vertical line indicates up to which point they seemed well resolved . as can be seen in figure 5 , problems with resolution",
    "occur when @xmath141 is of the order of @xmath166 , indicated by the horizontal line .",
    "since the numerical viscosity nvt as introduced in section 3 is approximately equal to @xmath170 , convergence for increasingly fine grids also demonstrates that it does not introduce artificial effects . for the finest resolution",
    "the numerical viscosity was less than a tenth of the physical viscosity in the center of the grid .",
    "from all this we feel confident that the plot of our best - resolved run in figure 5 gives a faithful description of the original equations up to the point indicated .",
    "figure 5 indicates that @xmath167 goes to infinity as the singularity @xmath140 is approached .",
    "all derivatives of the velocity as well as second or higher derivatives of the height are found to blow up even faster .",
    "this means their asymptotic value increases faster than a negative power of @xmath166 as we increase the resolution .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath88 , however , approaches a constant as @xmath140 .",
    "this is an important self - consistency property of our equations : the solutions never approach a situation where the surface parametrization is bound to break down",
    ".    there are some regions where @xmath171 is close to a power - law , but they never extend over more than two decades in length scales . in @xmath167 there is even less an indication of power - law behavior .",
    "the decay of @xmath141 is always faster than the @xmath172 power - law predicted by ( [ ( 5.1 ) ] ) , ( [ ( 5.2 ) ] ) .",
    "considering also the profiles @xmath173 and @xmath174 directly , we conclude that ( [ ( 5.1 ) ] ) , ( [ ( 5.2 ) ] ) is clearly not valid , even for @xmath175 .",
    "the reason may be that @xmath176 goes to infinity long before @xmath141 goes to zero , hence viscosity is important even on scales much larger than @xmath121 .",
    "the nature of the singularity of our inviscid equations probably is specific to the approximation .",
    "for example , it could be that the full euler equations , instead of overturning , produce localized regions of high vorticity which our approximation can not describe .",
    "the system described so far is determined by the four parameters @xmath1 , @xmath129 , @xmath112 , and @xmath3 .",
    "if it has a solution @xmath177 and @xmath178 , the system with parameters @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 will have the scaled solution    @xmath183    this is equivalent to saying that up to a rescaling of length and time the solution is determined by _ two _ dimensionless ratios , @xmath184 and @xmath185 , say . by the argument presented at the beginning of this section , one expects the solution near the singularity to be independent of the dimensions of the initial cylinder . hence _ all _ solutions , for @xmath186 and @xmath187 , can be written in the universal form    @xmath188    the @xmath189 signs in ( [ ( 5.4 ) ] ) take care of the fact that the solutions may have different parity , with fluid flowing from left to right or vice versa .",
    "we tested ( [ ( 5.4 ) ] ) by conducting simulations with different parameter values and calculating @xmath190 and @xmath191 from them .",
    "namely , we increased @xmath1 by a factor of 10 and also varied the viscosity .",
    "this causes the global behavior of the solution to change dramatically , yet on length and time scales comparable with @xmath121 and @xmath192 or smaller ( [ ( 5.4 ) ] ) is obeyed beautifully .",
    "figure 6 shows @xmath190 and @xmath191 as calculated from different runs , all at @xmath193 = 1.97 .",
    "note that the reduced profiles still evolve in time , unlike the similarity solutions of ( [ ( 5.1)]),([(5.2 ) ] ) .",
    "the key to the success of the present investigation lies in the construction of appropriate model equations to study the motion of thin columns of fluid .",
    "first , our expansion method allows to take viscous body forces as well as viscous boundary conditions into account .",
    "this makes it distinct from methods where the average velocity over the cross section is the dynamical variable , such as in the equations for shallow water waves @xcite . precisely due to the inclusion of boundary conditions ,",
    "the viscous terms in our equations become purely dissipative .",
    "second , we take the exact curvature term ( [ ( 2.16 ) ] ) into account .",
    "the importance of those higher order terms of the expansion for strong variations of @xmath77 was noticed before @xcite .",
    "figure 2 , for example , beautifully demonstrates how the model takes equilibrium shapes into account .",
    "also , regions of high slope ( @xmath194 ) at the top of the drop are very well represented .",
    "apart from experimental test , though , we do not see how to give a priori estimates of the quality of approximation in the framework of our model alone .",
    "a possibility is to study the next order in the expansion .",
    "apart from an equation of motion for @xmath77 , we now have _ two _ equations for the expansion coefficients of the velocity field , @xmath195 and @xmath196 . those equations ,",
    "although readily written down , are considerably more complicated than ( [ ( 2.16 ) ] ) , ( [ ( 2.17 ) ] ) and require new numerical methods . therefore , we consider it a study all of its own which should be investigated separately .",
    "most importantly , our equations remain self - consistent right up to the point of rupture @xmath140 .",
    "this means no other singularity occurs before that point .",
    "this is supported by our simulations over a wide range of viscosities and by preliminary mathematical analysis @xcite .",
    "specifically , there is no overturning of the profile .",
    "the full equations of motion certainly would not form singularities even in the case of overturning , but there does not seem to be experimental evidence for this to occur before breakup .",
    "( this excludes initial or boundary conditions with strong transversal velocity gradients , which `` force '' the flow to overturn , but which are not realizable in our equations in the first place . )",
    "hence we see no reason to doubt the applicability of our model even for small viscosities such as in water .",
    "however , the inviscid version of our equations clearly is at odds with experimental evidence , showing overturning on experimentally accessible timescales .",
    "this reflects the singular nature of the limit @xmath197 .",
    "we hope this will shed some light on the nature of this limit in the navier - stokes equation and its relation to the euler equation .",
    "we plan to develop a code with adaptable grid , which moves with the position of the minimum and introduces new grid points when needed .",
    "this code is expected to be much more effective and to allow us to reach considerably higher resolution .",
    "we hope this will allow us to explore the asymptotic regime even more carefully .",
    "another expected benefit of the new code is to be able to go _ beyond _ the first singularity by introducing a new grid point at the pinch .",
    "the equations will then be integrated from there with new boundary conditions .",
    "this will allow us to investigate a new range of phenomena , like formation of satellite drops , recoiling , etc .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have developed a one - dimensional equation for an axisymmetric thread of fluid .",
    "computed profiles coincide nicely with experiments .",
    "the inviscid equations are inconsistent , leading to singularities even before the breakup into drops .",
    "all solutions with @xmath154 are described by the universal scaling functions @xmath190 , @xmath191 sufficiently close to the singularity .",
