    "we now know that most protostars undergo a phase in which they accrete mass from a disk and that a stellar magnetic field dominates this process near the star .",
    "however , the transport of angular momentum , while fairly well - understood within the disk , remains a significant challenge for models of stellar spin ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "classical t tauri stars ( ctts s ) comprise a class of accreting protostars for which there is an abundance of observational data . for typical parameters in these systems ,",
    "the angular momentum deposited by accretion can spin the star up to breakup speed in @xmath1 years , assuming the star had nt already formed at breakup speed .",
    "since the accretion lifetime is often greater than @xmath2 yr , the stars must somehow rid themselves of this excess angular momentum .",
    "furthermore , a significant number of ctts s ( the so called `` slow rotators '' ) have spin rates as slow as @xmath010% of breakup speed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , requiring significant torques to maintain .",

    "* ) , for which the star needs a kilogauss - strength dipole magnetic field .",
    "indeed , ctts s are now known to possess kg - strength fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and magnetic star - disk interaction models have also explained several observed spectral features of ctts s ( e.g. , k91 ) .",
    "however , observations by @xcite and @xcite and theoretical considerations of @xcite have called the standard dl scenario into question . according to dl theory",
    ", magnetic field lines causally connect the star to the disk ( acting as `` lever arms '' ) and carry torques that oppose and balance the angular momentum deposited by accretion . although not usually considered in dl theory , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ukl ) demonstrated that differential rotation between the star and disk leads to an opening of the field , drastically reducing the magnetic connection between the two . in this letter , we consider the consequences of this reduced connection on dl .",
    "we find that the magnetic torque is significantly reduced , and show that the dl model therefore can not account for the angular momentum loss of the slow rotators .",
    "in order to discuss the disk - locked state , in which magnetic torques on the star exactly balance the angular momentum deposited by accreting material , we must first discuss the general case for an arbitrary state of the star - disk system but with the proper inclusion of field line opening .",
    "to this end , we mainly follow the formulation of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ac96 ) , and a more detailed presentation of our model will be given in @xcite .",
    "according to the typical assumptions , the central star contains a rotation - axis - aligned dipolar magnetic field .",
    "this field is anchored in the stellar surface and also threads a thin , keplerian accretion disk , in which the kinetic energy of orbiting gas is much greater than the magnetic field energy .",
    "the region above the star and disk contains low - density gas and is dominated by the magnetic field .",
    "the system is assumed to exist in a steady - state , where the accretion rate @xmath3 is constant in time and at all radii in the disk .",
    "figure [ fig_cartoon ] illustrates the basic idea and identifies the location where the disk is truncated ( @xmath4 ) and the corotation radius ( @xmath5 ) , where the keplerian angular rotation rate equals that of the star .",
    "the region in the disk threaded by closed stellar field lines is delimited by @xmath6 ( the usual assumption is @xmath7 ) .",
    "the assumption of a steady - state @xmath3 requires that the net angular momentum carried away from each annulus of the disk ( of width @xmath8 and vertically integrated ) equals @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the stellar mass . if the torque anywhere differs from this , the disk will restructure itself on an dynamical timescale , reestablishing the steady - state .",
    "the star and disk rotate at different angular speeds , except at the singular location @xmath5 .",
    "thus the magnetic field becomes twisted azimuthally by differential rotation , and magnetic forces act to restore the dipole configuration  conveying torques between the star and disk .",
    "the magnetic torque on the star exerted by a bundle of field lines threading an annulus in the disk , can be written as ( ac96 ) @xmath11 this differential torque depends only on the strength of the dipole moment @xmath12 and on @xmath13 , which is the `` twist '' ( or pitch angle ) of the field .",
    "the sign of the torque , here and in all equations , is relative to the star , so a positive torque spins the star up and thus spins the disk down",
    ".    the magnetic field can not be perfectly frozen - in to the gas of the disk .",
    "instead , it diffuses or reconnects through the disk azimuthally at some speed , @xmath14 ( ukl ) , where @xmath15 is the magnetic diffusivity ( we use the subscript `` t '' to suggest a turbulent value ) and @xmath16 is the local , vertical scale height of the disk . for a standard @xmath17-disk @xcite , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the orbital speed , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the turbulent prandtl number (= turbulent viscosity divided by @xmath15 ) .",
    "since both @xmath22 and @xmath23 are likely to have weak ( though unknown ) dependences on @xmath24 , we assume @xmath25 is constant .",
    "the radial dependence of the magnetic torque is mainly dominated by the quick falloff of the dipole magnetic field ( @xmath26 ) , and so a small radial dependence of @xmath25 will not much affect our results ( ac96 ) .    in general , @xmath25 is a simple scale factor that compares @xmath27 to @xmath19 .",
    "it measures the coupling of the magnetic field to the disk : @xmath28 corresponds to strong coupling and @xmath29 to weak .",
    "the value of @xmath25 is unknown ( ac96 used @xmath30 ) .",
    "typical @xmath17-disk parameters give a limit of @xmath31 and a likely value of a few orders of magnitude lower .",
    "for reasonable fiducial parameters , @xmath32 @xmath33 s@xmath34 km s@xmath35 .",
    "however , given the uncertainties , we keep @xmath25 as a free parameter",
    ".    where the field connects the star and disk , the magnetic twist ( and so @xmath27 ) will increase , until the field can slip through the disk at a rate equal to the differential rotation rate .",
    "thus , we expect a steady - state in which @xmath36.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath37 , since the differential rotation is zero there . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the twist increases to infinity .",
    "several recent theoretical and numerical studies of the star - disk interaction ( see ukl and references therein ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown with certainty that , as a dipole field is twisted this way , the magnetic torque reaches a maximum for finite @xmath13 , but then reduces back to zero for larger values .",
    "this occurs because , when the magnetic field is twisted enough so that the magnetic pressure associated with @xmath39 overcomes the poloidal field lines , the latter will `` inflate , '' opening to infinity at mid latitudes .",
    "the star and disk then become causally disconnected because open field lines can not convey torques between the two .",
    "the critical twist at which this happens is very nearly @xmath40 ( e.g. , ukl ) .",
    "the opening of field lines by this process can be added to the theory . for simplicity , we assume that the star is connected to the disk , as described above , at all locations where the twist is less than the critical value @xmath41 . where @xmath42 , the disk and star are disconnected , and so the differential magnetic torque there is zero .",
    "in other words , this process determines the outer radius of closed stellar field lines , @xmath6 . from equation [ eqn_gamma ] , we find that @xmath43 .",
    "ac96 assumed that the star is connected to the disk over a very large radial extent ( @xmath44 ) , which is equivalent to the assumption that @xmath45 .",
    "a combination of equations [ eqn_dtmag ] and [ eqn_gamma ] reveals the radial dependence of the differential magnetic torque ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "figure [ fig_dtorques ] shows all differential torques ( per @xmath8 ) in the disk , as a function of radius ( normalized to @xmath5 ) , assuming @xmath30 and @xmath45 ( i.e. , the ac96 solution ) . for the figure",
    ", we adopt representative system parameters from the well - studied ctts bp tau : @xmath47 yr@xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 @xcite , and @xmath51 = 2 kg @xcite .",
    "the stellar rotation period is 7.5 days ( see  [ sec_equilib ] ) .",
    "the lines in figure [ fig_dtorques ] labelled `` accretion '' and `` magnetic '' represent the differential accretion and magnetic torques , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , from equations [ eqn_tacc ] and [ eqn_dtmag ] , respectively .",
    "the steady - state condition requires the disk to structure itself such that the net differential torque everywhere equals @xmath52 .",
    "so when external magnetic torques ( @xmath53 ) act on the disk , there are torques internal to the disk ( e.g. , via the magnetorotational instability , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to counteract them and always provide a differential torque defined by @xmath54 , represented by the dashed line in figure [ fig_dtorques ] .",
    "from the figure , it is evident that @xmath46 is strongest near the star , where the magnetic field is strong , and @xmath53 acts to spin up the star inside @xmath5 . at @xmath5",
    ", @xmath53 goes to zero , since the field is not twisted there ( eq .  [ eqn_gamma ] ) . beyond @xmath5 , the twist increases , and",
    "so @xmath53 becomes stronger , now acting to spin down the star .",
    "since the dipole field strength decreases faster than the increase of @xmath13 , @xmath53 reaches a maximum ( in absolute value ) and then approaches zero as @xmath55 .    at the location where @xmath56 ( and @xmath57 ) , the torque from the stellar magnetic field is all that is neccesary to provide @xmath3",
    "thus , all of the specific angular momentum of the disk material at that location will end up on the star .",
    "this defines the radius @xmath4 ( dotted line in fig.[fig_dtorques ] ) , where the disk is truncated , and from where accretion will be magnetically channelled along field lines onto the star ( k91 ; not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cartoon ] ) .",
    "so the net torque on the star from the accretion of disk material , @xmath58 , is obtained by integrating equation [ eqn_tacc ] from @xmath4 to the surface of the star .",
    "similarly , the net magnetic torque , @xmath59 , is obtained by integrating equation [ eqn_dtmag ] over the entire magnetically connected region of the disk , from @xmath4 to @xmath6 , which gives @xmath60 . \\ ] ] this is exactly the solution found by ac96 for the special case that @xmath30 and @xmath45 . our formulation allows for an arbitrary value of the diffusion parameter @xmath25 and includes the effects of field line opening via twisting to a critical value of @xmath41 .",
    "we determine the dependence of the spin - down torque on @xmath25 by setting @xmath61 in equation [ eqn_tmag ] and adopting @xmath62 ( as justified by , e.g. , ukl ) .",
    "we find that @xmath63 in the strong coupling limit ( @xmath28 ) , has a maximal value for @xmath30 , and @xmath64 in the case of weak coupling ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "this behavior can be understood as a competition between two different effects : one is that , when @xmath25 is small , the size of the magnetically connected region in the disk ( @xmath6 ) is small , reducing @xmath59 ; secondly , when @xmath25 is large , the field is less twisted ( eq.[eqn_gamma ] ) at each radius , reducing @xmath53 .",
    "these two effects conspire to give a maximal value of @xmath59 , for the critical value of @xmath30 , which thus represents the `` best case '' for dl theory . even for this `` best case , '' the proper treatment of field line opening ( @xmath62 )",
    "gives a total spin - down torque that is a factor of four times less than if @xmath45 .    to illustrate the effect of field line opening , figure [ fig_dtorques2 ] shows the differential torques in the disk , for the same parameters as figure [ fig_dtorques ] , except that now @xmath62 , and the spin period is 4.1 d ( see  [ sec_equilib ] ) . the magnetic field is now open for @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is zero there ( by assumption ) .",
    "it is clear that the integrated torque @xmath59 will be less than if the magnetic field were everywhere closed ( i.e. , for @xmath45 ) .",
    "for any given values of @xmath10 , @xmath68 , @xmath51 , @xmath3 , and the stellar rotation period , the star - disk interaction theory presented in section [ sec_torques ] gives the net torque ( @xmath69 ) on the star .",
    "the system is stable in that , for fast rotation , the net torque spins the star down , and for slow rotation , the star spins up . for typical ctts parameters",
    ", the net torque will spin the star up or down in @xmath1 yr ( e.g. , ac96 ) .",
    "so one expects that most systems older than this will exist in an equilibrium state , in which the net torque on the star is zero , and in which the system is `` disk locked '' with a period @xmath70 .",
    "the equilibrium spin state is determined by combining the condition of net zero torque ( @xmath71 ) with the definition of @xmath4 ( i.e. , where @xmath72 ) .",
    "one finds that , in the dl state , there is a single predicted value of the truncation radius , @xmath73 , that depends on the quantity @xmath74 , but not on any other system parameters .",
    "if @xmath74 approaches zero , @xmath73 approaches @xmath5 . the ratio @xmath75 monotonically decreases for increasing @xmath74 , but it never becomes smaller than 0.91 , as @xmath76 .",
    "we calculate that the equilibrium angular spin rate of the star is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a dimensionless function that depends only @xmath25 and @xmath41 .    figures [ fig_dtorques ] and [ fig_dtorques2 ] show the torques for stars that are in their equilibrium spin states , @xmath79 and 4.1 d , respectively .",
    "a comparison of these two figures reveals the effect of field line opening ( see  [ sec_torques ] ) .",
    "when this occurs , the net spin - down torque is decreased , so the star must spin faster for it to be in equilibrium .",
    "a faster spin reduces @xmath5 , so the torques come from closer to the star , where the dipole field is stronger .",
    "thus , a faster spin makes up for the decreased size of the magnetically connected region .",
    "also , the truncation radius is nearer the corotation radius in figure [ fig_dtorques2 ] than in [ fig_dtorques ] ( @xmath80 , compared to @xmath81 ) .    equation [ eqn_spineq ] has the same dependences on system parameters as several dl models in the literature ( e.g. , k91 and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the factor @xmath82 varies slightly from model to model . for example , both k91 and @xcite use @xmath83 , while the ac96 value ( i.e. , for @xmath30 and @xmath45 ) is @xmath84 .",
    "our formulation of the problem includes the effects of field line opening and determines the dependence of the function @xmath82 on the diffusion parameter @xmath25 .",
    "the solid line of figure [ fig_cbg ] reveals this dependence , for @xmath62 . for comparison ,",
    "if the field remains closed for arbitrary twist values ( @xmath85 ) , @xmath86 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the k91 value of @xmath82 is indicated by a dashed line .",
    "the effect of field line opening is significant .",
    "for the `` best case '' ( @xmath30 ) , the predicted spin rate is 1.8 times faster than for @xmath45 and 2.6 times faster than predicted by k91 . for a more reasonable value of @xmath87 ,",
    "the predicted spin is more than an order of magnitude faster than all other dl models , in which the field is typically assumed to remain closed while largely twisted .    to date , dl models have had some success in explaining the spin rates of slow rotators . for the example case of bp tau",
    "( see  [ sec_torques ] ) , when one assumes @xmath30 and @xmath45 , equation [ eqn_spineq ] predicts @xmath88 d , corresponding to 6% of breakup speed and agreeing with the predictions of most models in the literature .",
    "this predicted period is remarkably similar to the observed value of 7.6 d @xcite .",
    "however , when one properly includes the effect of field line opening ( for @xmath62 ) , the `` best case '' ( @xmath30 ) model predicts @xmath89 d , and the spin - up time is less than @xmath90 yr  significantly shorter than bp tau s age of @xmath91 yr @xcite .",
    "further , for @xmath92 , @xmath93 d , with a spin - up time of @xmath94 yr !",
    "it is also important to note that we have thus far used parameters for bp tau determined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if instead we use the higher @xmath3 derived by @xcite of @xmath95 yr@xmath48 , even the `` standard '' ( @xmath30 , @xmath85 ) model predicts @xmath96 d , with a spin - up time of @xmath97 yr .",
    "alternatively , if we use the @xmath98 upper limit on the dipole field strength of 200 g from @xcite , even the `` standard '' theory gives @xmath93 d.    we must conclude that either bp tau and other slow rotators are rapidly spinning up , or the dl picture , as an explanation of stellar spin , is incomplete .",
    "the former requires ( e.g. )  a recent , dramatic increase in @xmath3this seems unlikely , especially for bp tau , for which the accretion disk is probably in the process of clearing out @xcite . in order for bp tau to currently be in an equilibrium spin state , there must be significant spin - down torques on the star other than those carried along field lines connecting the star to the disk .",
    "we have shown that a large portion of the magnetic field connecting the star to the disk will open up due to the differential rotation between the two , resulting in a spin - down torque on the star by the disk that is much less than if the field is assumed to remain closed .",
    "the predicted disk - locked spin rate is therefore much faster , so that the dl scenario can not explain the angular momentum loss of the slow rotators .",
    "in addition , there are at least three , completely independent issues raised by other authors : 1 ) @xcite found no correlation between accretion parameters and spin rates of tts in orion .",
    "2 ) ctts s apparently do not have strong dipole fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are required for dl at slow spin rates .",
    "3 ) stellar winds are expected to open field lines that would otherwise connect to the disk @xcite .",
    "a disk wind could have a similar effect .",
    "we conclude that , in order for accreting protostars to spin as slowly as 10% of breakup speed , there must be spin - down torques acting on the star other than those carried by magnetic field lines connecting the star to the disk .",
    "the presence of open stellar field lines implies that excess angular momentum may be carried by a stellar wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this remains an open question .",
    "we are investigating the role of stellar winds , since then @xmath70 will depend mostly upon the stellar wind parameters , thereby explaining the lack of correlation between spin periods and accretion parameters ."
