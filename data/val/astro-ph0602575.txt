    "the standard theory of structure formation based on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm explains that the building blocks of cosmic structures in the universe are virialized halos made up of cold dark matter particles , and that these cdm halos form hierarchically via gravity from the primordial density fluctuations with a characteristic spectrum .",
    "although this standard theory has been remarkably successful in explaining the observed properties of the universe on the galaxy cluster scale , its validity on the galactic scale is still inconclusive , since observational data seemed inconsistent with the theory on that scale .    confronted with observational challenges , various theoretical attempts have been recently made to refine the standard theory of structure formation on the galactic scale .",
    "one of such attempts is the currently proposed `` broken hierarchy '' scenario . according to this idea",
    ", the gravitational clustering to form dark halos does not proceed in a perfectly hierarchical way on all scales , unlike the prediction of the standard theory .",
    "rather , the scenario suggests that the clustering process take on a somewhat anti - hierarchy on small mass scales as the gravitational _ tidal _ field favors the formation of a pancake ( an object collapsed along one direction ) over that of a halo ( an object collapsed along all three directions ) .",
    "this scenario has been shown to be capable of resolving several conflicts with observational data .",
    "for example , @xcite recently showed that if the pre - virialization induced by the pancaking effect is taken into account , the observed hi mass function and the faint - end slope of the galaxy luminosity function can be explained within the context of the standard structure formation theory .",
    "promising as this scenario seems , it is not an easy task to test it against observations and to detect directly the local pancaking effect .",
    "a possible way to detect the pancaking effect is to investigate the _ anisotropy _ in the orientation of galaxies induced by the gravitational tidal field . according to the tidal torque theory ,",
    "the angular momentum of a galaxy is originated by the tidal interaction with the surrounding matter .",
    "a generic prediction of the tidal torque theory is that the direction of the galaxy angular momentum is not random but aligned with a local tidal shear tensor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , if a galactic halo is embedded in a local pancake that formed earlier than the galactic dark halo , then a correlation between the galaxy spin axis and the pancake principal axis should exist .",
    "in fact , it was claimed by many observational reports that the galaxy spin axes are correlated with the surrounding matter distribution @xcite .",
    "very recently , more convincing evidences for the anisotropy in the orientations of the galaxy spin axes induced by the tidal fields of the surrounding matter have been found .",
    "@xcite detected that the spin axes of the nearby edge - on spirals in the principal galaxy catalog ( pgc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have a strong tendency to lie parallel to the super - galactic plane ( sgp ) .",
    "@xcite also found that the spin axes of the galaxies located near the shells of the largest cosmic voids lie preferentially on the void surface .",
    "note , however , that these observations found evidences only for those particular cases that the galaxies are surrounded by the large - scale structure with a flat surface .",
    "in other words , what was detected so far is not the effect of the _ local _ pancake but the effect of the _ large scale _ coherence of the surrounding matter on the orientations of the galaxy spin axes . here , our goal is to detect a local pancaking effect by investigating the anisotropy on the orientation of the galaxy spins from observational data . in @xmath1",
    ", we determine the probability density distribution of the inclination angles of the tully disk galaxies relative to the local pancake planes . in @xmath2",
    ", we model analytically the anisotropy in the orientation of the galaxy spin axes in the frame of the tidal torque theory , and compare the analytic prediction with observational data .",
    "the results are discussed and a final conclusion is drawn in @xmath3 .",
    "to detect the intrinsic alignment of the galaxies and local pancake in the real universe , we use the tully catalog . in the tully catalog , @xmath4",
    "nearby galaxy properties observed from the whole sky are piled up . among them",
    "we make a subsample of @xmath5 disk galaxies which have a type @xmath6 listed in third reference catalog of bright galaxies ( rc3 , * ? ? ?",
    "the median redshift of the subsample is @xmath7 km / s .",
    "note that the gravitational weak lensing effect can be neglected at this low redshift @xcite .",
    "we focus our analysis on this subsample of spirals for the following reason .",
    "the spiral galaxies have relatively low velocity dispersion , approximately @xmath8 km / s @xcite .",
    "it indicates that the spiral galaxies did not move far from their initial lagrangian positions in the subsequent evolution .",
    "thus , the positions of the spirals may be optimal to define the local pancake planes .",
    "first , we measure the spin direction of the spiral galaxies by using the position angle ( pa ) on the sky and the projected axial ratio ( @xmath9 ) . assuming that the geometry of the sky is flat",
    ", the spin vector of each galaxy in the spherical coordinate system is obtained from @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for the calculation of the spin vectors",
    ", two fold degeneracy should be accounted for . in other words , it is hard to decide whether the galaxy rotates clockwise @xmath12 or anticlockwise @xmath13 .",
    "we consider the degeneracy problem statistically as follow .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath14 is calculated by @xmath15/2 $ ] , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the angles of the unit vector normal to the local pancake with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . to reduce the degeneracy",
    ", we use only edge - on galaxies whose axial ratio is less than 0.1 . the total number of the edge - on galaxies is found to be @xmath20 .",
    "the spin directions calculated in the spherical coordinates are transformed to those in the cartesian coordinates with the given equatorial coordinate positions ( 1950 equinox for ra and dec ) .",
    "now , a local pancake has to be determined at each given edge - on spiral whose spin vector is obtained .",
    "as mentioned in @xmath21 , theoretically the local pancake is defined as a sheet - like structure gravitationally collapsed along the major principal axis of a local shear . in practice , however , it is hard to apply this theoretical method for the observational data .",
    "instead , we employ the following practical scheme . at the location of each edge - on spiral , we first find the two nearest neighbors among all @xmath5 spirals in the subsample , and determine a local pancake as the plane encompassing the galaxy itself and its two nearest neighbors .",
    "figure [ fig : plane ] illustrates the configuration of an edge - on galaxy and its local pancake .",
    "the logic for this scheme is as follows : if the formation of a small - mass galactic halo is really preceded by that of a larger - mass local pancake at the early epoch , then the two - dimensional coherence in the locations of the neighbor galaxies should be expected . in other words , the placements of the nearest neighbors should be more or less arranged in the plane of the local pancake where they are all embedded .",
    "the scale of a local pancake at a given edge - on spiral is determined by the distance from the galaxy to the second nearest neighbor .",
    "it is worth mentioning again that we consider only the spiral galaxies since their peculiar velocities are relatively small so that they are expected to conserve their initial lagrangian position .    now that a local pancake at the location of each edge - on disk is defined , we compute the cosines of the angles between the spin axis and the unit vector normal to the pancake plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : plane ] ) as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 $ ] , @xmath24 is the unit spin vector of an edge - on galaxy , and @xmath25 are the unit vectors of the displacement to the first and the second nearest neighbors , respectively .",
    "the unit vector normal to the local pancake is determined as @xmath26 . from this , we compute the probability density distribution , @xmath14 , and the average , @xmath27 , which are shown as histograms with the error bars in the upper and the lower panels of figure [ fig : prob ] , respectively . the errors for estimating @xmath14 are just poissonian .",
    "for the errors involved in measuring @xmath28 , we use the statistical deviation , @xmath29 , ( @xmath30 : the number of galaxies in each bin ) from the no - inclination case of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the observational results shown in figure [ fig : prob ] reveal that the spin axes of the disk galaxies tend to be inclined onto the plane of the local pancakes , and that the degree of the inclination decreases with the pancake scale .",
    "it reflects that the galaxy inclination to the pancake plane is indeed a _",
    "local _ correlation with the gravitational tidal field .",
    "suffering from the large error - bars due to the small sample size , we test the rejection of the no - inclination hypothesis , using the observed data points .",
    "it is found that the no - inclination hypothesis is rejected at the @xmath33 confidence level .",
    "to construct a theoretical model for the inclinations of disk galaxies relative to the local pancakes , we assume the following .    1 .",
    "the angular momentum of a disk galaxy is originated by the initial tidal interaction with the surrounding matter @xcite , which induces a correlation in the orientation of the galaxy angular momentum vector , @xmath34 , with the local tidal shear tensor , @xmath35 defined as the second derivative of the perturbation potential .",
    "2 .   on small - mass halo scales ,",
    "the gravitational tidal field promotes the formation of a pancake @xcite that precedes the formation of a low - mass halo .",
    "the formation of a local pancake is well described by the zeldovich approximation @xcite , according to which the local density at present epoch is given as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mean density of the universe , @xmath38 are the three eigenvalues of the local tidal shear tensor , @xmath39 in a decreasing order . equation ( [ eq : zel ] ) implies that the formation of a local pancake ( i.e. , a first shell crossing ) occurs at present epoch if the largest eigenvalue , @xmath40 , reaches unity .",
    "the minor principal axis of the inertia momentum tensor of a local pancake is aligned with the major principal axis of the local shear tensor , since the gravitational collapse along the major principal axis of the local shear tensor forms a pancake .",
    "4 .   let @xmath41 be a galaxy angular momentum vector in the principal axis system of the inertia momentum tensor of a local pancake .",
    "now that @xcite already found an analytic expression for the probability density distribution of the cosines of the angles between @xmath42 and the major principal axis of the inertia momentum tensor ( which is the minor principal axis of @xmath39 according the above third assumption ) , one can derive straightforwardly the probability density distribution of the cosines of the angles between @xmath42 and the _ minor _ principal axes of the inertia momentum tensors ( which is the major principal axes of @xmath39 ) by rotating the minor to the major principal axis as @xmath43 where , @xmath44 is a correlation parameter in the range of @xmath45 $ ] . here , @xmath46 represent the three eigenvalues ( in a decreasing order ) of the unit traceless tidal shear tensor , @xmath47 defined as @xmath48 with @xmath49 , related to @xmath50 , as @xmath51 basically , equation ( [ eq : ptheta ] ) is obtained from the formula given in lee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) simply by exchanging @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "the correlation parameter , @xmath44 , in equation ( [ eq : ptheta ] ) depends on the filtering scales on which the galaxy angular momentum @xmath42 and the local shear tensor @xmath39 are smoothed .",
    "the correlation parameter @xmath44 is a constant only if the two scales are the same .",
    "if they are different , then the correlation parameter is no longer a constant but varies with the filter scales @xcite as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a constant , and @xmath56 is a rms fluctuation of the linear density field smoothed on the pancake scale @xmath57 . here",
    ", @xmath58 represents the galactic scale @xmath59mpc @xcite on which the angular momentum vector @xmath42 is smoothed .    to complete equation ( [ eq : ptheta ] )",
    ", one has to specify the values of @xmath60 and @xmath44 . according to the second assumption , a local pancake of the scale length @xmath57 forms when the largest eigenvalue of @xmath40 of the tidal shear tensor smoothed on the scale @xmath57 reaches unity .",
    "as for the other two eigenvalues , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , one may use the most probable values under the constraint of @xmath63 .    using the probability density distributions ,",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 , derived by @xcite , and with the help of the bayes theorem , we evaluate the constrained joint probability density distribution of @xmath61 and @xmath62 as @xmath66 by equation ( [ eq : plambda ] ) , we determine the most probable values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which turn out to be almost scale - independent , changing only very mildly in the range of @xmath67 $ ] and @xmath68 $ ] , respectively as the scale @xmath57 varies from @xmath58 to over @xmath69 mpc .",
    "the values of @xmath60 can be obtained straightforwardly through equations ( [ eqn : hlam1])-([eqn : hlam3 ] ) .",
    "now , we fit the observational data points obtained in @xmath1 to equation ( [ eq : ptheta ] ) with the value @xmath44 as an adjustable free parameter .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath44 is found to be @xmath70 through the @xmath71 minimization .",
    "note here that this best - fit value corresponds not to the constant @xmath55 in equation ( [ eq : corr ] ) but to the _ mean _ value averaged over @xmath57 .",
    "we also perform an analytic evaluation of the average value , @xmath72 as @xmath73 now that this average value , @xmath72 , is a function of @xmath57 as the correlation parameter , @xmath44 , in @xmath14 depends on @xmath57 , we can determine the best - fit value of the constant @xmath55 by fitting the observational data obtained in section @xmath1 to equation ( [ eq : mval ] ) with equation ( [ eq : corr ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath74 .",
    "figure [ fig : prob ] depicts the analytically derived probability density distribution @xmath14 and the average value @xmath72 as solid lines in the upper and the lower panels , respectively .",
    "the comparison with these analytic results with the observational points reveals a fairly good agreement between the two .",
    "we have presented an observational evidence for the preferential inclinations of the spin axes of the tully disk galaxies onto the local pancake planes , and provided a quantitative theoretical explanation to the observed phenomena in terms of the tidal interaction and the broken hierarchy .",
    "successful as the match between the theory and the observation seems , some limitations of our analysis deserve discussing here .",
    "first , in the observational analysis the redshift distortion effect is not properly taken into account .",
    "even though the redshift distortion effect is unlikely to reduce the observed inclination strength , as @xcite noted , it should be necessary to account for it to find a true signal .",
    "second , in the theoretical analysis , we describe the formation of a local pancake in terms of the zeldovich collapse condition .",
    "this is an obvious oversimplification of the reality , as @xcite noted that the real collapse condition should be more complicated .",
    "although the zeldovich collapse condition is a good approximation , a more realistic description of the formation of a local pancake would be desirable .",
    "finally , we conclude that our observational and theoretical study of the local pancaking effect on the orientation of the galaxy spin axes will provide a new hint to the unsolved problem of the galaxy formation .",
