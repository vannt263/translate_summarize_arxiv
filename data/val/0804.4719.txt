    "this work is related to combinatorial constructions of weight bases for the irreducible representations of semisimple lie algebras on which the action of the chevalley generators is made explicit .",
    "we will use the setup introduced by donnelly @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to encode a weight basis into an edge - colored ranked poset ( called a supporting graph ) , whose hasse diagram has its edges labeled with two complex coefficients .",
    "this structure is known as a representation diagram , and it explicitly gives the action of the chevalley generators of the lie algebra on the weight basis .",
    "verifying that an assignment of labels to an edge - colored poset is a representation diagram amounts to checking that the labels satisfy some simple relations .",
    "thus , constructing a basis of a representation amounts to solving a system of equations associated to a poset .",
    "the goal in the basis construction is finding supporting graphs with a small number of edges , possibly edge - minimal ones ( with respect to inclusion ) ; this amounts to finding a basis for which the action of the chevalley generators is expressed by a formula with a small number of terms .",
    "it is often the case that the labels of an edge - minimal supporting graph are essentially the unique solution of the corresponding system of equations .",
    "this property is known as the solitary property of the associated basis .",
    "another interesting property of many supporting graphs constructed so far is that kashiwara s crystal graphs of the corresponding representations @xcite are subgraphs .",
    "thus , the theory of supporting graphs can be viewed as an extension of the theory of crystal graphs , which has attracted considerable interest in the combinatorics community in recent years .",
    "finally , many supporting graphs are better behaved as posets than the corresponding crystal graphs / posets , being lattices , modular lattices , or even distributive lattices .    in the case of irreducible representations of @xmath0 ,",
    "the celebrated gelfand - tsetlin basis is the only known basis with respect to which the representation matrices of the chevalley generators are given by explicit formulas .",
    "it turns out that the supporting graph of the gelfand - tsetlin basis is edge - minimal , solitary , and a distributive lattice @xcite ; we will call it the gelfand - tsetlin lattice .",
    "donnelly constructed solitary , edge - minimal , and modular lattice supporting graphs for certain special representations , most notably : the fundamental representations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite , the `` one - rowed '' representations of @xmath2 @xcite , and the adjoint representations of all simple lie algebras @xcite .",
    "molev constructed bases of gelfand - tsetlin type ( i.e. , which are compatible with restriction to the lie subalgebras of lower rank ) for all irreducible representations of the symplectic and orthogonal lie algebras @xcite .",
    "the corresponding representation diagrams ( i.e. , the action of a system of chevalley generators on the basis ) are not explicitly given , but they can be derived from molev s formulas for the action of certain elements spanning the lie algebra . as posets , these supporting graphs are not lattices in general , and there are indications that they are not edge - minimal in general , either .",
    "our ultimate goal is finding edge - minimal supporting graphs for symplectic and orthogonal representations , as well as studying their combinatorics . as a first step , in this paper we revisit the gelfand - tsetlin basis for @xmath0 , by studying it in donnelly s combinatorial setup .",
    "this allows us to show that the construction of the gelfand - tsetlin basis relies on nothing more than a simple rational function identity .",
    "moreover , the corresponding solitary and edge - minimal properties , which were derived via theoretical considerations in @xcite , are proved here in a very explicit way , by a simple algorithm for solving equations on the gelfand - tsetlin lattice .",
    "we envision that such algorithms and rational function identities will play a crucial role in our future work . on the other hand ,",
    "let us note that the proofs of the gelfand - tsetlin formulas that appeared since the original paper @xcite by gelfand and tsetlin in the fifties ( which contained no proof ) use more sophisticated algebraic methods , based on : lowering operators @xcite , boson - calculus techniques @xcite , polynomial expressions for wigner coefficients @xcite , the theory of the mickelsson algebras @xcite , and the quantum algebras called yangians @xcite . in turn ,",
    "molev s constructions @xcite of his bases for orthogonal and symplectic representations are based on complex calculations related to yangians .    in terms of the combinatorial model for describing the supporting graph",
    ", we use semistandard young tableaux rather than gelfand - tsetlin patterns . by analogy",
    ", we expect to use kashiwara - nakashima or de concini tableaux @xcite for the representations of the symplectic and orthogonal algebras",
    ". note that these tableaux were already used in donnelly s work mentioned above , whereas molev s work is based on gelfand - tsetlin patterns of type @xmath3 .",

    "for @xmath158 it is clearly 1 . for @xmath159 , it is the following symmetric rational function in @xmath160 : @xmath161 the common denominator is the vandermonde determinant in @xmath160",

    "this concludes the proof of ( [ ratfn ] ) by the symmetry of its left - hand side under the diagonal action of @xmath154 .",

    "we now think of an element @xmath80 of the gelfand - tsetlin lattice as a semistandard young tableau , using the earlier description of covering relations @xmath181 as pairs of ssyt in which @xmath108 is obtained from @xmath80 by incrementing an entry from @xmath9 to @xmath183 . recall",
