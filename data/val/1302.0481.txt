    "the standard for the mathematical treatment of chemical reaction kinetics is provided by the law of mass action ( lma ) , stating that the rate of an elementary reaction is proportional to the product of the densities of its participants  @xcite . however ,",
    "unless the environment is continually well - stirred , the interplay between reaction and dispersion implies fluctuations in space and time , which tend to promote retarded kinetics  @xcite .",
    "indeed , typically there is a critical dimension below which ineffective diffusive mixing leads to a qualitative change in the speed of the reaction , and one speaks of anomalous kinetics  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , above the critical dimension , one usually expects fluctuation only to alter the decay kinetics quantitively , by influencing the reaction rates  @xcite .",
    "yet , rigorous analysis often only supports the validity of the lma for asymptotically long times and low densities , whereas analytical treatment away from this regime is rare  @xcite .    employing a non - perturbative renormalization group ( nprg ) approach , in this work",
    "we explore a bimolecular reaction scheme where particles clot upon contact , @xmath0 , and explore space by diffusion . in the spirit of investigating idealized and simplified models to gain insight into microscopically much more complex processes ,",
    "this scheme was introduced by smoluchowski to help understand the physics behind the coagulation of gold particles suspended in an electrolyte  @xcite .",
    "this type of reactions is of interest for a variety of fields of natural science , with applications to the dynamics of aerosols  @xcite , the binding of proteins  @xcite , the decay of defects in solids  @xcite , or the kinetics of chemical reactions  @xcite .    from perturbative renormalization group analysis",
    "it is known that , below the critical dimension two , the reaction kinetics displays critical behavior with anomalously slow decay of the density  @xcite .",
    "we recover this result , and demonstrate that for the one - dimensional case the nprg allows to obtain a substantially enhanced quantitative result as compared to the perturbative approach .",
    "the nprg is also suited for the analysis above the critical dimension .",
    "we can thus show that for three - dimensional systems the lma is violated by a relatively strong , non - analytic term in the density .",
    "the effects become more pronounced as the particle density increases and are attributed to long - range fluctuations and many - particle correlations .",
    "the corresponding additional term is a universal function of the non - universal , macroscopic decay rate ( the proportionality factor in the lma ) . to calculate the latter",
    ", we construct a mapping between the physics at the microscopic scale , defined by the shape and size of the particles and the structure of the lattice , and an effective macroscopic description . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is one of the very few instances where the renormalization group idea of mapping physics from the micro- to the macro - scale can be accomplished exactly .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "nprg ] we give a brief introduction to the nprg formalism .",
    "starting from the microscopic definition of the process , it allows to calculate the _ effective action _",
    "@xmath1 , by systematically integrating over the degrees of freedom , going from high to low momenta and frequencies . from @xmath1",
    "the macroscopic behavior , such as the kinetic equation governing the time evolution of the density , can be deduced .",
    "after these preliminaries , we proceed in section  [ sec : belowdc ] to discuss the coagulation process below the critical dimension .",
    "we demonstrate that the specific properties of the problem at hand imply significant simplifications of the flow equation .",
    "this enables us to derive an adequate numerical description of the anomalous decay kinetics , characterized by universal parameters .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : abovedc ] we turn to the treatment of the process above the critical dimension in a broader and more detailed discussion than is given in our previous paper on this topic  @xcite .",
    "the nprg based on the effective action @xmath1 is a suitable framework for the study of fluctuation effects in reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "originally developed for the treatment of equilibrium physics  @xcite , it has been adapted recently to non - equilibrium systems  @xcite . in the context of reaction - diffusion , it has led to new insights in the critical properties of branching and annihilating random walks and in the generalized voter class  @xcite .    for completeness and to set the notation we provide in this section a short introduction to the nprg formalism .",
    "we specialize the treatment to the coagulation process and put particular emphasis on the derivation of the kinetic equation . for authoritative reviews and more detailed accounts on the general topic the reader",
    "is referred to  @xcite .      in a first step ,",
    "the process is mapped onto a field theory by a fock space formalism , an approach devised by several authors @xcite , for a review see  @xcite . in our case of diffusing particles which coagulate upon contact , the action of the path integral can be split up as @xmath2 = { { \\mathcal{s}}}_{z}[{{\\bar{\\phi}}},\\phi ] + { { \\mathcal{s}}}_{\\epsilon}[{{\\bar{\\phi}}},\\phi ] + { { \\mathcal{s}}}_{\\lambda}[{{\\bar{\\phi}}},\\phi ] \\,.\\ ] ] here the fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 are related to particle annihilation and creation operators , respectively , and are variables of the position @xmath5 on the lattice and of time @xmath6 .",
    "there is a term for the time evolution @xmath7 = z \\sum_{{\\mathbf{x}}}\\int \\ !",
    "\\mathrm{d } { t } \\ ,   { { \\bar{\\phi}}}({{\\mathbf{x}}},t ) \\partial_t \\phi({{\\mathbf{x}}},t ) \\,,\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath8 ( it may change along the renormalization group flow , although for the coagulation process this not the case , as discussed below ) .",
    "furthermore , we have a diffusion term @xmath9 $ ] ( a particle can hop from site @xmath10 to site @xmath11 with rate @xmath12 , when @xmath10 and @xmath11 are adjacent sites , indicated by brackets @xmath13 in the following sum ) , which becomes @xmath14\\big [ \\phi({{\\mathbf{x}}},t ) - \\phi({{\\mathbf{y}}},t ) \\big]\\ ] ] in position space ( again @xmath8 ) . in fourier space , due to translational invariance , it is diagonal , @xmath15 = z \\int_{\\mathbf{q},\\omega }            \\epsilon(\\mathbf{q } ) { { \\bar{\\phi}}}(-\\mathbf{q},-\\omega ) \\phi(\\mathbf{q},\\omega )   \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 runs over the first brillouin zone of volume @xmath18 . unless otherwise stated , in this article , we consider a hypercubic lattice , where @xmath19 and the dispersion relation reads  @xcite @xmath20 and we set the lattice spacing equal to one , @xmath21 , to define the length scale . in this case",

    "it is therefore adequate to perform the continuum limit , where @xmath24 , i.e. eq .  ( [ eq : epsq ] ) is replaced with    rcl _ &",
    "= & _ , q^2 |(-,- ) ( , ) = + & = & - t |(,t ) ^2 ( , t ) .    finally in the action  ( [ eq : actionannicoag ] ) there is a reaction term @xmath25 $ ] for coagulation @xmath26 , which reads @xmath27 { { \\bar{\\phi}}}({{\\mathbf{x}}},t ) \\phi({{\\mathbf{y}}},t ) \\phi({{\\mathbf{x}}},t )   \\,.\\ ] ] in order to be able to study interactions with a finite range , we have introduced here the _ reaction kernel _ @xmath28 , which defines the shape and size of the particles .",
    "thus , if there is a particle at site @xmath5 , a particle at site @xmath29 is annihilated with rate @xmath30 .",
    "again , below the critical dimension the microscopic properties are irrelevant for the universal behavior and it suffices to consider local interactions @xmath31 = \\int \\ ! { { \\mathrm{d}}}^d x \\ , { { \\mathrm{d}}}t   \\ ,   \\lambda \\left [ { { \\bar{\\phi}}}({{\\mathbf{x}}},t ) + 1 \\right ] { { \\bar{\\phi}}}({{\\mathbf{x}}},t ) \\phi({{\\mathbf{x}}},t)^2 \\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath32 .      in analogy to equilibrium physics , for reaction - diffusion systems one can define a generating functional @xmath33 \\!= \\!\\int \\mathcal{d } \\bar \\phi \\mathcal{d } \\phi \\exp\\!\\left [ \\ ! - { { \\mathcal{s}}}[{{\\bar{\\phi}}},\\phi ] + \\sum_{{\\mathbf{x}}}\\",

    "the fields @xmath34 are introduced in order that the associated functional @xmath35 = \\ln \\mathcal{z}[j , \\bar j]\\ ] ] genererates the connected green s functions by functional derivation in the fields @xmath36 , @xmath37 at @xmath38 .",
    "we remark that the field @xmath36 induces particle input @xmath39 , as long as @xmath36 is positive .",
    "the degrees of freedom are integrated systematically , going from fast frequencies and short wavelengths at the microscopic scale @xmath40 ( related to the typical reciprocal length scale of the interaction ) to slow frequencies and long wavelengths .",
    "this is implemented by introducing a `` mass term '' @xmath41 to the action suppressing fluctuations of these modes ,    rcl [ eq : kdependentz ] & _ k[j , |j ] = | , &    where the mass term reads @xmath42 = \\int_{\\mathbf{q},\\omega }",

    "denoting the expectation values @xmath48 at @xmath49 , it is defined by @xmath50 = \\sum_{{{\\mathbf{x } } } } \\int \\ !   { { \\mathrm{d}}}t \\ ,   \\left(\\bar j \\psi   + j { \\bar\\psi}\\right ) - \\delta { { \\mathcal{s}}}_{{k}}[{\\bar\\psi},\\psi ] - w_{{k}}[j,\\bar j ] \\,.\\ ] ] notice that this is just the legendre transform of @xmath51 , up to the term @xmath41 , which is added for mathematical convenience and vanishes as @xmath52 .    at the microscopic scale @xmath40 the cutoff function @xmath53",
    "is supposed to be large , so that it freezes the deviations from the expectation values @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , and renders the functional trivial .",

    "therefore , if we employ the continuum limit in the action @xmath58 ( as in section  [ sec : belowdc ] ) , a finite @xmath40 sets the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "if otherwise we keep the discrete lattice structure , @xmath59 only runs over the first brillouin zone , intrinsically enforcing an ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "similarly , we have an implicit ultraviolet cutoff for finite - size objects , such as balls with radius @xmath60 , where modes with @xmath61 are suppressed . in these cases",
    "there is no need for an explicit cutoff and we can set @xmath62 .",
    "the central equation of the nprg formalism is the wetterich equation .",
    "this flow equation connects the effective average action at the microscopic scale @xmath63 , where fluctuations are neglected , with the effective action @xmath64 where all degrees of freedom are integrated .",

    "the derivative expansion is an approximation based on the fact that infrared singularities are suppressed by the cutoff function @xmath72 and therefore the effective average action @xmath73 $ ] is analytic so long as the scale @xmath74  @xcite .",

    "let us take the continuum limit of the action as the initial condition .",
    "a common truncation of the effective average action is the `` leading order '' approximation @xmath77 = \\int \\ ! \\mathrm{d}^d x\\ , \\mathrm{d}t \\left[u_{{k}}({\\bar\\psi},\\psi ) + z_{{k } } { \\bar\\psi } ( \\partial_t - d_{{k } } \\nabla^2 ) \\psi \\right]\\ , .",

    "the nprg enables us to extract the universal amplitude @xmath136 even in one dimension where the estimate for @xmath136 is in good agreement with exact calculations .    above the critical dimension ,",
