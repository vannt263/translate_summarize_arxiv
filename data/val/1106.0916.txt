    "the numerical renormalization group ( nrg)@xcite is a powerful method that provides a highly systematic non - perturbative approach to the wide realm of so - called quantum impurity systems . these consist of an arbitrary small quantum system ( the _ impurity _ ) in contact with a macroscopic non - interacting usually fermionic bath .",
    "each part is simple to solve exactly on its own . in presence of interaction at the location of the impurity",
    ", however , the combination of both gives rise to strongly - correlated quantum - many - body phenomena .",
    "@xcite wilson s logarithmic coarse - graining of the bath leads to a semi - infinite chain with exponentially decaying couplings , which justifies the concept of energy scale separation .",
    "that is the wilson chain can be diagonalized iteratively by adding one site at a time and retaining the lowest @xmath0states only .",
    "the obvious question , however , is how many states should one keep on average for convergence in this procedure ? at a given iteration there is no quantitative _ a priori _ measure that indicates how many low - energy states are required for a proper description of the remaining low - energy physics .",
    "usually , the only way to check convergence within the nrg is by repeating the entire calculation and showing that the results no longer change when further increasing @xmath0 .",
    "therefore an nrg calculation is typically run somewhat blindly for some pre - determined @xmath0 .     by including and analyzing @xmath1more nrg iterations .",
    "the impurity ( dot ) is entirely contained in the first site , while the bath is coarse - grained and mapped onto the remaining semi - infinite tight - binding chain of sites @xmath2 . ]",
    "this somewhat uncontrolled truncation in the nrg is in stark contrast to the situation in the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) .",
    "@xcite dmrg is based on a ( strictly ) variational principle , and as such has a clean well - defined truncation of the state space for part of the system through the discarded weight in its reduced density matrix .",
    "@xcite in contrast to the less suggestive plain number @xmath0of states kept , the discarded weight represents a reliable _ quantitative _ measure for the accuracy of a calculation . within the dmrg , @xmath0can be easily adjusted according to some predefined threshold in the discarded weight , instead .",
    "motivated by dmrg then , an approximate similar criterion can be established within the nrg as will be shown in the following .",
    "the analysis requires a slightly longer chain , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : wilson - chain ] . with",
    "the extra @xmath1sites traced out again from the ground state space of the enlarged system , this allows to estimate the discarded weight .",
    "the latter offers a quantitative convergence measure that is specifically of interest for numerically expensive models such as multi - channel models , or models where the energy scale separation along the wilson chain might be in question due to modifications in the discretized hamiltonian . in either case",
    ", a small discarded weight provides a strong indication for converged nrg data .",
    "furthermore , the reduced density matrices generated for the evaluation of the discarded weight also allow a quite different analysis in terms of their _ dominant _ correlations .",
    "in particular , combining their entanglement spectra into _ entanglement flow diagrams _ , this offers a complementary view to the usual nrg energy flow diagram , which is entirely based on the analysis of the low - energy state space of a prior nrg run .",
    "the paper is thus organized as follows . in sec .",
    "i the essentials of the numerical renormalization group are revisited , including the construction of reduced density matrices . sec .",
    "ii then uses a specific set of reduced density matrices in the definition and analysis of the discarded weight within the nrg . sec .",
    "iii offers a complementary view on these reduced density matrices by analyzing their entanglement content in terms of entanglement spectra .",
    "iv , finally , summarizes and includes an outlook .      within the nrg ,",
    "the continuum of the non - interacting bath of half - bandwidth @xmath3 is logarithmically coarse - grained in energy space , followed by an exact mapping onto a semi - infinite so - called wilson - chain .",
    "@xcite the impurity space is coupled to the first site of this chain only , as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : wilson - chain ] .",
    "the logarithmic coarse - graining is defined through the dimensionless discretization parameter @xmath4 . with the chemical potential at energy zero , the continuum of states in the energy intervals @xmath5",
    "$ ] is effectively represented by single fermionic levels ( coarse - graining ) , including an arbitrary z - shift with @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite the subsequent exact mapping onto the semi - infinite chain ( lanczos tridiagonalization ) @xcite results in an effective tight - binding chain with the _ exponentially _ decaying hopping @xmath7 between sites @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for sufficiently large @xmath10 ,",
    "typically @xmath11 , this then justifies the essential nrg assumption of _ energy scale separation _ : by iterative diagonalization of the wilson chain by adding one site at a time , large energies are considered first , with the ( approximate ) eigenstates at large energies _ discarded _ and considered unimportant in the description of the lower energy scales still to follow .",
    "thus each site of the wilson chain corresponds to an energy shell with a characteristic energy scale , @xmath12 here , the prefactor was chosen such , that the rescaled couplings @xmath13 quickly approach unity for longer wilson chains for arbitrary @xmath10 and z - shift , with the discretization following the prescription of [ ] for a flat hybridization ,",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath14 .    with @xmath15 the full hamiltonian @xmath16 of the wilson chain up to and including site @xmath8 ,",
    "its low - energy eigenstates are given by the nrg eigenstates @xmath17 . complemented by an arbitrary state @xmath18 for the remainder of the system following site @xmath8 , the nrg assumption of energy scale separation can be summarized then in the following approximation , @xcite @xmath19 _ i.e._the states @xmath20 are , to a good approximation , also eigenstates of the entire wilson chain .",
    "the energies @xmath21 at iteration @xmath8 are usually expressed relative to the ground state energy of that iteration , and rescaled by a factor @xmath22 to resolve the energy shell at iteration @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting energies are referred to as _ rescaled energies_. for fully fermionic systems , they typically show an intrinsic even - odd behavior . thus combining the rescaled energies _ vs._even and odd iterations @xmath8 separately , this results in the standard _",

    "therefore the maximum number of states @xmath0 , that one can maintain in a calculation , is quickly reached after @xmath35 iterations .",
    "for every subsequent iteration , the state space @xmath36 is truncated by retaining the lowest @xmath0states in energy only .",
    "this leads to the distinction between @xmath37 and @xmath38 for kept and discarded states at iteration @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , this also splits the a - tensor into two parts , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , that propagate the state kept space from the previous iteration into the newly generated kept or discarded space , respectively .",
    "the truncation criteria with respect to a fixed prespecified @xmath0 can be softened towards a energy cutoff , @xcite @xmath41 , that is taken constant in rescaled energies . for a fair comparison for different z - shifts ,",
    "it will be specified in units of the energy scale @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def - escale ] ) . since nrg data typically appears bunched at certain energies ( _ e.g._see fig .",

    "considering that the entanglement spectra are obtained solely based on the wave function , the agreement of the low - energy fixed point spectra are stunning . a possible larger disagreement at higher energies , _ i.e._for earlier wilson shells , on the other hand , depends on the specific physical situation . given the nrg background , as an outlook this appears to suggest the following .",
    "for all energy shells ( iterations ) @xmath8 where the entanglement spectrum is quantitatively comparable to the nrg energy spectrum for the lowest set of states , the reduced density matrices themselves are not crucially important in the description of the system . instead , they may be replaced by thermal density matrices in the nrg eigenbasis . in a sense , by tracing out the low - energy sector , the resulting reduced density matrices maintain an approximate thermal character , with implications to thermalization at a given energy shell .",
