    "heavy - ion collisions provide the unique possibility to study baryonic matter well above saturation density .",
    "the conditions inside the dense reaction zone and the in - medium properties of hadrons can be explored by measuring the particles created in such collisions @xcite . in particular , the production of strange mesons at beam energies below or close to their respective threshold in binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath3 at @xmath4  gev , @xmath5 at @xmath6  gev ) is well suited for these studies .",
    "the production at these energies requires multiple nucleon - nucleon collisions or secondary collisions like @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) for the k@xmath0 or the strangeness exchange reaction @xmath9 for the k@xmath1 .",
    "the propagation of k@xmath0-mesons in nuclear matter is characterized by the absence of absorption ( they contain an @xmath10-quark and hence can not be absorbed in hadronic matter consisting almost entirely of u- and d - quarks ) . in combination with the sensitivity to multi - step processes , which are more likely to occur at high particle densities , this absence of absorption makes them nearly undisturbed messengers carrying information on the hot and dense phase of the reaction .",
    "this allows to extract information on the nuclear equation - of - state @xcite .",
    "the k@xmath1 on the other hand can be reabsorbed via the inverse direction of the strangeness exchange reaction mentioned above . by analyzing observables sensitive to the reaction dynamics like energy distributions and angular distributions , both as a function of the size of the reaction system and of the collision centrality",
    ", the time dependence of the k@xmath0- and of the k@xmath1-emission can be investigated .",
    "the experiments were performed with the kaon spectrometer ( kaos ) at the heavy - ion synchrotron ( sis ) at the gsi in darmstadt @xcite .",
    "the magnetic spectrometer has a large acceptance in solid angle and in momentum ( @xmath11  msr , @xmath12 ) .",
    "the particle identification and the trigger are based on separate measurements of the momentum and of the time - of - flight .",
    "the trigger suppresses pions and protons by factors of 10@xmath13 and of 10@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the background due to spurious tracks and pile - up is removed by a trajectory reconstruction based on three large - area multi - wire proportional counters .",
    "the short distance of 5 - @xmath15  m from the target to the focal plane minimizes the number of kaon - decays in flight .",
    "the loss of kaons by decay is accounted for by monte carlo simulations using the geant code .",
    "three different collision systems have been investigated ( , , and ) at incident beam energies ranging from @xmath16  agev to @xmath17  agev .",
    "results have been published in @xcite and will in part be presented in this contribution .",
    "section [ eos ] briefly summarizes the results on the excitation function of the k@xmath0-production and the conclusions that can be drawn on the nuclear equation - of - state . in section [ data ] a detailed analysis of dynamical observables for the reaction systems and at an incident beam energy of @xmath2  agev is presented , followed by conclusions on the time dependence of the emission of k@xmath0- and of k@xmath1-mesons in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "early transport calculations predicted that the k@xmath0-yield in collisions at beam energies below the production threshold in nucleon - nucleon collisions would be enhanced by a factor of about 2 if a soft rather than a hard equation - of - state is assumed @xcite .",
    "recent calculations take into account modifications of the kaon properties within the dense nuclear medium .",
    "the assumed repulsive k@xmath19n - potential depends nearly ( or less than ) linearly on the baryonic density @xcite and thus reduces the k@xmath0-yield accordingly . on the other hand , at subthreshold beam energies the k@xmath19-mesons",
    "are created in secondary collisions involving two or more particles and hence their production depends at least quadratically on the density . to disentangle these two competing effects",
    "we have studied the k@xmath0-production in a light ( ) and in a heavy collision system ( ) at different beam energies near threshold .",
    "the maximum baryonic density reached in reactions is significantly higher than in reactions .",
    "moreover , the maximum baryonic density reached in au+au reactions depends strongly on the compression modulus of nuclear matter @xmath20 @xcite whereas in c+c collisions this dependence is rather weak @xcite .",
    "hence , the ratio of the k@xmath0-multiplicity per nucleon @xmath21 in to the one in is expected to be sensitive to the compression modulus @xmath20 while providing the advantage that uncertainties within the experimental data ( beam normalization etc . ) and within the transport model calculations ( elementary cross sections etc . )",
    "are partly cancelled .",
    "figure [ fig_eos ] shows a comparison of the ratio @xmath22 for k@xmath0 with the predictions of rqmd transport model calculations @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed with two values for the compression modulus : @xmath23  mev ( solid line ) and @xmath24  mev ( dashed line ) corresponding to a `` soft '' or `` hard '' nuclear equation - of - state , respectively .",
    "the rqmd transport model takes into account a repulsive k@xmath19n - potential and uses momentum - dependent skyrme forces to determine the compressional energy per nucleon ( i.e. the energy stored in the compression ) as a function of the baryon density .",
    "the comparison demonstrates clearly that only the calculation based on a soft nuclear equation - of - state reproduces the trend of the experimental data .",
    "a similar result is obtained using the transport code iqmd @xcite .",
    "in this section detailed results of experiments on the production and on the propagation of k@xmath0- and of k@xmath1-mesons in and in collisions at a beam energy of @xmath2  agev are presented .",
    "this is the lowest beam energy where k@xmath1 have been observed so far in collisions between heavy nuclei .",
    "the spectral and the angular distributions of strange mesons as a function of the collision centrality have been measured and significant differences between k@xmath0 and k@xmath1 have been found @xcite .    due to the energy loss in the au - target ( thickness 0.5 mm ) the average energy of the au - beam is @xmath26  agev .",
    "the energy loss of the ni - ions in the ni - target is negligible . a high - statistics sample of k - mesons was recorded at a polar angle of @xmath27 = 40@xmath28",
    ". data from au+au collisions were also taken at @xmath27 = 32@xmath28 , 48@xmath28 , 60@xmath28 , and 72@xmath28 with lower statistics .",
    "the laboratory momenta of the k - mesons range from 260 to 1100 mev .",
    "figure [ fig_pty ] shows the acceptance covered by these measurements as a function of the rapidity normalized to beam rapidity @xmath29 and of the transverse momentum @xmath30 .",
    "the centrality of the collision was derived from the multiplicity of charged particles measured in the interval @xmath31 by a hodoscope consisting of 84 plastic - scintillator modules . in order to study the centrality dependence the data measured close to midrapidity ( @xmath32 ) were grouped into five centrality bins both for and for collisions .",
    "the most central collisions correspond to 5% of the total reaction cross - section @xmath33 , the subsequent centrality bins correspond to 15% , 15% and 25% of @xmath33 .",
    "the most peripheral collisions correspond to 40% of @xmath33 .",
    "the total reaction cross - section was derived from a measurement with a minimum bias trigger and was found to be @xmath33 = 6.0@xmath340.5 barn for au+au and @xmath33 = 2.9@xmath340.3 barn for ni+ni collisions .",
    "the corresponding mean number of participating nucleons for each centrality bin @xmath35 was calculated from the measured reaction cross - section fraction for this bin using a geometrical model assuming spherical nuclei .",
    "figure [ fig_spec_tmbin ] shows the production cross sections for k@xmath0- and for k@xmath1-mesons measured close to midrapidity as a function of the kinetic energy in the center - of - momentum system for the five centrality bins in au+au collisions .",
    "the uppermost spectra correspond to the most central reactions , the subsequent bins are shown from the top to the bottom of the figure with decreasing centrality . the error bars represent the statistical uncertainties of the kaon and the background events .",
    "an overall systematic error of 10% due to efficiency corrections and beam normalization has to be added .",
    "the solid lines represent the boltzmann function @xmath36 fitted to the data .",
    "@xmath37 is a normalization constant and the exponential function describes the energy distribution with @xmath38 being the inverse slope parameter .    the spectra presented in figure [ fig_spec_tmbin ] exhibit a distinct difference between k@xmath1 and k@xmath0 : the slopes of the k@xmath1-spectra are steeper than those of the k@xmath0-spectra .",
    "the inverse slope parameters @xmath38 as a function of the mean number of participating nucleons @xmath35 for each centrality bin are displayed in figure [ fig_slopes ] .",
    "@xmath38 increases with increasing centrality and is found to be significantly lower for k@xmath1 than for k@xmath0 , even for the most central collisions .",
    "the multiplicities of k@xmath0- and of k@xmath1-mesons in as well as in collisions at @xmath2  agev differ by about a factor of 50 .",
    "the inclusive kaon multiplicity is defined for each centrality bin as @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the kaon production cross section and @xmath41 being the fraction of the reaction cross - section for the particular event class .",
    "figure [ fig_ratio ] presents the multiplicity per number of participating nucleons @xmath42 as a function of @xmath35 for k@xmath0 ( upper panel ) and for k@xmath1 ( middle panel ) . both , for k@xmath0- and for k@xmath1-mesons",
    "the multiplicities exhibit a similar rise with @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , @xmath43 is found to be almost identical in ni+ni and in au+au collisions .",
    "the resulting k@xmath1/k@xmath0 ratio is about 0.02 below @xmath44 and decreases slightly to about 0.015 for the most central collisions ( lower panel ) .",
    "another observable sensitive to the production mechanism is the polar angle emission pattern .",
    "the deviation from isotropy of the k@xmath0- and of the k@xmath1-emission can be studied using the ratio @xmath45/@xmath46 as a function of @xmath47 . here , @xmath45 is the invariant kaon production cross - section measured at the polar angle @xmath48 in the center - of - momentum frame and @xmath46 is the one measured at @xmath49",
    ". due to limited statistics we considered only au+au collisions grouped into two centrality bins : near - central ( impact parameter @xmath506 fm ) and non - central collisions ( @xmath516 fm ) . figure [ fig_angdis ] displays the anisotropy ratio for k@xmath0 ( upper panels ) and for k@xmath1 ( lower panels ) , both for near - central ( right ) and for non - central collisions ( left ) . for an isotropic distribution this ratio would be constant and identical to 1 .",
    "the solid lines in figure [ fig_angdis ] represent the function @xmath52 which is fitted to the experimental distributions with the values of @xmath53 given in the figure . in near - central collisions",
    "the k@xmath1-mesons exhibit an isotropic emission pattern whereas the emission of k@xmath0-mesons is forward - backward peaked .",
    "the angular distributions observed for k@xmath0 and for k@xmath1 in collisions at @xmath54  agev are similar to the ones presented in figure [ fig_angdis ] @xcite .",
    "the measured emission patterns indicate that the k@xmath1 - in contrast to the k@xmath0 - have lost the memory of the beam direction for central heavy - ion collisions .",
    "when summarizing the experimental results on the production and on the propagation of @xmath55-mesons at @xmath2  agev remarkable similarities and differences between k@xmath0 and k@xmath1 are found .",
    "the yields of the k@xmath0- and of the k@xmath1-mesons are related to each other ( as indicated by the almost constant k@xmath1/k@xmath0 ratio as a function of @xmath35 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase - space distributions ( polar angles and spectral slopes ) of the k@xmath0- and of the k@xmath1-mesons differ significantly .",
    "these observations can be explained by the following scenario . in the early phase of the collision",
    "the k@xmath0-mesons and the hyperons are produced via processes like @xmath56 or @xmath7 with @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the k@xmath0-mesons leave the reaction volume with little rescattering because of their long mean free path . therefore , they probe the early , dense and hot phase of the collision and have been used to obtain information on the nuclear equation - of - state as discussed in section [ eos ] .",
    "the k@xmath1-mesons , however , can hardly be produced in direct nn collisions at a beam energy of @xmath2  agev , even when taking into account fermi motion .",
    "indeed , transport model calculations predict that in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies the production and absorption of k@xmath1 predominantly proceeds via strangeness - exchange reactions @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "as the k@xmath0 are produced associated with the hyperons the yields of k@xmath0 and k@xmath1 are correlated .",
    "indeed , the measured k@xmath1/k@xmath0 ratio only slightly decreases with increasing centrality , i.e. with the system size .",
    "the mean free path of the k@xmath1-mesons is about @xmath59  fm in nuclear matter due to strangeness - exchange reactions like @xmath60 .",
    "however , via the inverse reaction ( @xmath9 ) the k@xmath1 may reappear again thus propagating to the surface of the reaction volume .",
    "those of the k@xmath1-mesons which reach the detector are emitted in a late stage of the collision when the reaction volume is expanding and cooling down .",
    "consequently , the spectral slope of the k@xmath1 is steeper than the one of the k@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the emission pattern of the k@xmath1-mesons is nearly isotropic due to multiple collisions .",
    "both features are observed in the experiment .",
    "the assumption of different emission times for k@xmath0- and for k@xmath1-mesons is supported by a transport model calculation using the iqmd code .",
    "figure [ fig_iqmd ] shows the results of a simulation of central collsions ( @xmath61  fm ) at @xmath2  agev @xcite . in the upper panel",
    "the time dependence of the density in the reaction zone is given .",
    "the lower panel shows the rate @xmath62 of emitted k@xmath0 ( solid line ) and of emitted k@xmath1 ( dashed line ) as a function of their production time @xmath63 . within this calculation",
    "the k@xmath1 are emitted at a later stage of the reaction during the expansion of the reaction volume while the k@xmath0 are emitted during the high - density phase of the collision .    in summary , we have presented differential cross sections and phase - space distributions of k@xmath0- and of k@xmath1-mesons produced in heavy - ion collisions at @xmath2  agev .",
    "we observed the following features : ( i ) the k@xmath1/k@xmath0 ratio is quite independent of @xmath35 both for and for collisions , ( ii ) in near - central collisions k@xmath1-mesons are emitted almost isotropically whereas k@xmath0-mesons exhibit a forward - backward enhanced emission pattern , and ( iii ) the inverse slope parameters are significantly smaller for k@xmath1- than for k@xmath0-mesons even for the most central collisions .",
    "these findings indicate that ( i ) the production mechanisms of k@xmath0- and of k@xmath1-mesons are correlated by strangeness - exchange reactions , ( ii ) k@xmath1-mesons undergo many collisions before leaving the reaction volume and , as a consequence , ( iii ) k@xmath1-mesons freeze out later than k@xmath0-mesons .",
