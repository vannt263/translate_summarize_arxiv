    "the cores of galaxy clusters are ubiquitously populated by old , passively evolving spheroids , with little evidence for ongoing or recent episodes of star formation .",
    "this suppression of star formation ( sf ) is mainly caused by interactions among the densely packed galaxies , and to a lesser extent by interactions between the hot , x - ray emitting intracluster medium ( icm ) and the galaxies .",
    "the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) that usually sits at the bottom of the potential well and is coincident with the peak of the cluster x - ray emission , is typically a very massive , bright , early type galaxy , that only rarely is associated with significant star formation activity .",
    "cool core ( cc ) clusters are systems whose icm shows a minimum core temperature that is about one third of the global icm temperature and a low core entropy ( @xmath1130 kev  @xmath12 ) , that reflects significant radiative cooling taking place in the cluster innermost regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations have shown that bcgs with ongoing star formation activity are usually hosted by cc clusters @xcite .",
    "however , there is still a large variance in current results on the fraction of star forming bcgs and the amount of their star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "this is partly because different diagnostics are used ( e.g. , optical emission lines , uv continuum , far - infrared ) that may be affected by dust emission and agn contamination , but also because samples are often not representative .",
    "in particular , @xcite investigated the star formation activity in a sample of 77 bcgs drawn from a flux limited , x - ray selected cluster sample and reported a lack of star formation in that sample , based only on optical emission lines .",
    "in contrast , @xcite detected star formation in 15 out of 68 bcgs using a more robust diagnostic based on the fir emission .",
    "the caveat in this fraction is that the sample of bcgs originate from a mix of cluster samples , mostly selected to include massive and relaxed clusters that are thus biased toward ccs , therefore are more likely associated with star forming bcgs .",
    "it is well known that agn play a crucial role in the regulation of the star formation in bcgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ample evidence for agn feedback has been collected in the last decade , where radio jets have been shown to inflate bubbles in the icm and hence offset cooling , nonetheless the link between agn and star formation is not yet properly established .",
    "the recent study of the phoenix cluster at @xmath0=0.596 @xcite , the strongest cc cluster known to date , showed a bcg with a very high sfr _ and _ an equally significant agn activity .",

    "the cluster is dominated by a very large , luminous central galaxy that , contrary to what is common in most massive clusters , is undergoing a phase of copious star formation .",

    "the far - infrared ( fir ) is the best diagnostic for star formation as it provides a direct measure of the reprocessed uv light from the on - going star formation , allowing us to measure the total fir luminosity , star formation rates and dust temperatures of the cluster members .",

    "the _ herschel _ observations of macs1931 were carried out in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 as open time 1 and 2 programmes ( pi egami , obsid = 1342215993 , 1342241619 , 1342241681 , 1342254639 ) aimed at studying the star formation properties of lensing clusters .",

    "here we outline our procedure to obtain the catalog of fir sources in the field of macs1931 .",
    "our catalog is based on blind source detections in the 100 and 160@xmath26 maps separately , using sextractor @xcite . as standard for pacs data ,",
    "the photometry is made with fixed apertures with radii of 6@xmath22 and 9@xmath22 at 100@xmath26 and 160@xmath26 , respectively , corrected with the encircled energy factors given by @xcite .",
    "this procedure was validated with manual aperture photometry .",
    "given the difficulty to obtain reliable errors with standard source detection algorithms because of the correlated noise present in pacs data , we compute the photometric errors as the 1@xmath2 detection limits in each band , in addition to 7% ( calibration accuracy of the flux scale ) of the source flux .",
    "the spire source detection was performed using a simultaneous fit to all sources in the prior list based on the pacs detections .",
    "we run the xid method @xcite using the same prior catalog on the three spire bands , using the corresponding spire point response function for each band . if the fitted spire flux density at the position of an input pacs source is below the @xmath27 sensitivity in each band we assigned the @xmath27 values as upper limits .",
    "these correspond to 3@xmath5 the confusion noise and are equal to 17.4 , 18.9 and 20.4 mjy at 250 , 350 and 500@xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we obtain 31 detections at @xmath282@xmath2 in at least one of the pacs bands , within @xmath29=3.6@xmath25 centered on the bcg . to identify the origin of these sources we match the fir catalog with our spectroscopic and photometric redshift catalogues .",
    "the spectroscopic catalog consists of 2800 redshifts obtained with vimos ( clash - vlt large programme 186.a-0798 , pi rosati , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas the photo-@xmath0 catalogues are based on photometry from the hst and subaru .",
    "we find that , of the 31 sources in the cluster field , 4 are confirmed members , 2 are candidate members ( photo-@xmath0 ) and 18 are interlopers .",
    "since the completeness of our spectroscopic sample of cluster members is close to 90% it is unlikely that the remaining 7 _ herschel _ sources are at the cluster redshift .",
    "we fit the galaxies fir seds using lephare @xcite with chary & elbaz ( 2001 ) templates , to measure the galaxy integrated infrared luminosity @xmath30 in the range 81000@xmath1 m .",

    "the sfr of our sample , measured with pure starburst templates , spans the range 5 - 210 m@xmath7yr@xmath9 . if we exclude the highest star - forming galaxy - the bcg - we find an average sfr of 9.2 m@xmath7yr@xmath9 .",
    "the total sfr of the six cluster galaxies amounts to 256 m@xmath7yr@xmath9 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the recent result on the sfr of massive clusters using _ herschel _ data by @xcite . in the next section",
    "we perform a more detailed study of the bcg and refine its sfr measure , after accounting for the impact of the agn . with the exception of the bcg that is an ultra luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg , @xmath3310@xmath34 ) , the fir detected cluster galaxies are lirgs or normal star forming galaxies .",
    "the temperature of the dust , @xmath35 , present in the galaxies is computed with a modified black body model with an emissivity index @xmath36 fixed to 1.5 .",
    "apart from galaxy i d 75 , that shows some contamination with the bcg fluxes in the spire bands , we find @xmath35 in the range 24 - 33 k , which is within the range of dust temperatures for @xmath370.3 lirgs and ulirgs @xcite",
    ". the fir properties of the cluster members are summarized in table 1 .",
    "in this section we analyze in detail the bcg sitting at the core of the cluster .",
    "it is uncommon to have a cluster with a massive bcg with a sfr level of 210 m@xmath7yr@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , our initial sfr result may be biased by the presence of a strong obscured agn , which needs to be carefully modeled .",
    "we also explore the interconnections between the star formation of the bcg and the mass deposition rate in the cluster core .",
    "the uv and optical properties of this galaxy have been studied in @xcite and @xcite , that computed the galaxy star formation rate using different diagnostics .",
    "we convert their values to the ones obtained with the updated calibration used here , as described in @xcite .",
    "while @xcite found a sfr = 69 m@xmath7yr@xmath9 using uv photometry , @xcite , in a crude approximation , derived a value twice larger , 146 m@xmath7yr@xmath9 , based on optical broad band imaging .",
    "these calculations do not account for dust extinction nor for contamination from agn activity .",
    "the bcg of macs1931 hosts an x - ray bright agn , embedded in the icm emission , which we model and subtract from the agn signal .",
    "we detect about 1030 counts in the 0.5 - 7 kev band .",
    "our spectral analysis with an intrinsic slope fixed to @xmath38 , provides an intrinsic absorption of @xmath39 @xmath40 , which is very close to the canonical value @xmath41 @xmath40 above which an agn is classified as absorbed .",
    "the unabsorbed rest - frame luminosities are @xmath42 ergs s@xmath9 and @xmath43 ergs s@xmath9 .",
    "we first investigate the contribution of the agn component to the fir emission using decompir @xcite , an sed model fitting software that decomposes the fir sed in agn and starburst components . in short ,",
    "the agn component is an empirical model based on observations of moderate - luminosity local agns , whereas the 5 starburst models represent a typical range of sed types , with an extrapolation beyond 100@xmath26 using a grey body with @xmath36=1.5 .",
    "the best - fit model obtained with decompir considering the _ herschel _ datapoints ( fig .",
    "2 ) yields @xmath30 = 2.2@xmath44 l@xmath45 , with agn and starburst contributions of 53% and 47% , respectively .",
    "this allows us to recompute the sfr removing the agn contamination .",
    "we thus obtain sfr(bcg)= 150@xmath815 m@xmath7yr@xmath9 , a value similar to that reported in @xcite but much more robust .",
    "macs1931 harbors one of the most x - ray luminous cool cores known .",
    "the properties of the core of macj1931 have been investigated in detail in @xcite , where an equivalent mass deposition rate of @xmath46 yr@xmath9 in the inner 70 kpc has been estimated in the assumption of isobaric cooling . despite the high cooling rate ,",
    "this cluster is missing the central metallicity peak which is otherwise measured in the majority of cc clusters @xcite .",
    "this suggests bulk transport of cool gas out to large distances from the centre due to the powerful agn outburst @xcite .",
    "in particular , a bright , dense region north of the bcg shows low - temperature and high - density metal - rich gas and is consistent with being a remnant of the cool core after it was disrupted by the agn ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we constrain the icm mass cooling rate , @xmath47 , in the inner 30 kpc around the bcg under the same assumption of isobaric cooling .",
    "the main difference relative to the previous analysis by @xcite is that we focus on a limited temperature range , 0.15 - 3.0 kev , and in particular below 1.8 kev .",
    "in fact , the signature of an isobaric cooling flow is given by a specific relation between the emission measure and the gas temperature , as described in the model mkcflow @xcite .",
    "therefore we measure the cooling rate of the gas independently in five temperature bins , using a set of mkcflow models within xspec @xcite in the following temperature intervals : 0.150.25 , 0.250.45 , 0.450.9 , 0.91.8,1.83.0 kev .",
    "we also consider a single temperature mekal @xcite component to account for the gas hotter than 3 kev .",
    "we detect about 13700 net counts ( 0.5 - 7.0 kev band ) in the inner 30 kpc .",
    "since it is not possible to measure the metal abundance of the cold gas , given its low emission measure , we conservatively assume that its metallicity is equal to that of the mekal component which dominates the emission , which is @xmath48 .",
    "we find that the mass deposition rate for gas below 3 kev has a 95% single - sided upper limit of @xmath49 yr@xmath50 ( see dashed horizontal line in fig .",
    "3 , left panel ) , while the temperature of the mekal component is @xmath51 kev .",
    "when we try to constrain @xmath47 in temperature intervals , we find that we are able to measure a substantial mass deposition rate only in the temperature range 1.8 - 3.0 kev .",
    "below 1.8 kev , the upper limit on the mass deposition rate is only @xmath52 yr@xmath50 at a 95% c.l .",
    "the upper limits measured in different temperature bins are shown in fig .",
    "3 , left panel .",
    "we find that @xmath47 is significantly lower - at least by a factor 3 - than the measured sfr .",
    "this result is in broad agreement with the correlation between the sfr observed in the bcg and the properties of the hosting cool core @xcite , but in disagreement with previous measurements of a mass deposition rate typically higher than the sfr in the bcg @xcite .",
    "clearly , the ratio of the mass deposition rate and the sfr is sensitive to the times scales for icm cooling and star formation and it is not expected to vary much among clusters . to check whether we can reconcile the results for macsj1931 with previous results",
    ", we also explore the presence of colder clouds ( with temperature @xmath53 k ) in the icm beyond 30 kpc , where a significant fraction of colder gas can cool and fall into the innermost regions .",
    "this is suggested by a recent work by @xcite which showed that colder clouds can precipitate out of the hot gas via thermal instability on a large region centered in the core , feeding black hole accretion and/or star formation in the bcg . even in this case",
    "we find an upper limit ( 95% c.l . ) of 45 and 52 @xmath54 yr@xmath9 in annuli of 30 - 50 and 50 - 70 kpc , respectively .",
    "therefore , we do not find evidence of a large amount of colder gas within 30 kpc nor falling from beyond 30 kpc onto the centre .",
    "the low upper limits on the mass deposition rate found in the case of macsj1931 , may require a scenario where the time scale for star formation rate in the bcg is longer than the cooling events occurring intermittently in the cluster core . to investigate this possibility",
    ", we are currently exploring the relation between @xmath47 and sfr in a small sample of nearby clusters whose bcg shows significant star formation ( molendi et al . in preparation ) .",
    "in this letter , we present a study of the dust obscured star formation properties in the galaxy cluster macs1931 at @xmath0=0.352 , and a detailed investigation on the origin of the bcg sfr .",
    "we detect fir emission in 6 cluster members and we derive sfrs based on broad band fir seds in the range 5 - 150 m@xmath7yr@xmath9 , and dust temperatures in the range 24 - 33 k. the strongest _ herschel _ source in the cluster field is , notably , the bcg , one of the few ulirgs detected in the nearby universe . our analysis shows the importance of adequately assessing the contamination from agn , but even accounting for @xmath2050% of l@xmath4 due to the agn we estimate a sfr=150 m@xmath7yr@xmath9 for the bcg , a surprising value for a galaxy expected to be `` red & dead '' . at similar redshift only abell 1835 has a comparable sfr .",
    "at the same time , cold gas ( @xmath551.8 kev ) is not detected in the icm gas , and the mass deposition rate has a robust upper limit of 58 m@xmath7yr@xmath9 , suggesting that in this case star formation lasts longer than the icm cooling events .",

    "we also thank the anonymous referee for useful comments .",
