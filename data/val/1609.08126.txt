    "due to the importance of entanglement as a resource for quantum information processing , the task of determining whether a quantum state is entangled or not plays a crucial role for the theoretical and practical developments of the field .",
    "while the usefulness of bipartite entanglement is well established , the development of applications using entanglement in multipartite systems is still in its early stages , however , it has already been shown to play a fundamental role for universal quantum computation in the measurement - based quantum computation paradigm @xcite and for cryptographic tasks such as secret sharing @xcite . concerning the characterisation of entanglement ,",
    "one of the biggest challenges to start with is the fact that it is np - hard in the hilbert space dimension to decide whether a given quantum state is entangled @xcite .",
    "since the dimension grows exponentially in the number of involved parties , the exact answer to that question will probably remain elusive for many - body systems .",
    "nonetheless there exists an abundance of necessary separability criteria capable of certifying entanglement in a practically satisfying way . for bipartite entanglement , the two most paradigmatic techniques are positive maps which are not completely positive @xcite and entanglement witnesses @xcite .",
    "these two concepts are intimately related , as every positive map directly leads to a multitude of entanglement witnesses and every witness can be associated to a positive map @xcite .",
    "both concepts are sufficient for the characterisation of entanglement , in the sense that , for every entangled state , there exists both a positive map and an entanglement witness certifying its entanglement @xcite .    turning to multipartite systems",
    ", the potentially underlying separability structure adds a layer of complexity to the detection of entanglement .",
    "as opposed to just entanglement in multipartite systems @xcite , mixed multipartite states pose another fundamental challenge .",
    "counterintuitively , multipartite systems can exhibit entanglement across every partition , yet still not feature any genuine multipartite entanglement ( gme ) . to certify gme ,",
    "an abundance of entanglement witnesses were derived ( see e.g. reviews @xcite ) and a characterisation in terms of semi - definite programs ( sdp ) was developed @xcite .",
    "there is however no direct correspondence to the concept of positive map based criteria , not even for the undoubtedly most used criterion of positivity under partial transposition ( ppt ) .",
    "indeed , the naive application of a positive map to a subsystem in correspondence to the bipartite case must inevitably fail , as all it can reveal is entanglement across that bipartition , which , as we just mentioned , is never enough to infer gme .    in this manuscript",
    "we expand the notion of positive map based criteria from the bipartite to the multipartite case , thus filling a gap in the set of available tools .",
    "our main idea is to derive maps which are positive on all biseparable states , whilst not positive on the set of all states .",
    "we first give a general description of the approach and then showcase some exemplary maps .",
    "the maps we derive are based on convex combinations of positive maps that are used in the bipartite case , thus generalising the ppt criterion and others to the multipartite case .",
    "the manuscript is organised as follows : in section [ sec.preliminaries ] we set the stage by recalling some important bipartite and multipartite entanglement definitions and giving the motivation of this work . in section [ sec.results ]",
    "we introduce our framework and general construction method based on positive maps .",
    "we also make some general existence considerations . in section [ sec.examples ]",
    "we give some explicit examples of our method .",
    "in particular , a remarkably simple partial transposed based criteria is worked out and a choi map construction is shown to robustly detect noisy @xmath0-qudit ghz - like states as well as ppt states . finally in section [ sec.discussion ]",
    "we discuss possible extensions and applications of our method .",
    "to set the stage and notation we first remind the reader of the concepts of separability , entanglement witnesses and positive maps in the bipartite case .",
    "a finite dimensional state is called separable iff it can be decomposed into a convex combinations of pure product states , i.e. @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a probability distribution .    the states which can be written in the form of eq .",
    "form a closed convex set and therefore , as a consequence of the hahn - banach theorem ( see @xcite ) , the set of separable states can be separated from any point in its complement by a hyperplane that can be written as @xmath3 for a self - adjoint operator ( observable ) @xmath4 .",
    "now if ( by convention ) @xmath5 and there exits at least one ( entangled ) state @xmath6 such that @xmath7 , the operator @xmath8 is referred to as an _ entanglement witness_. the above thus states that any entangled state can be detected by an entanglement witness @xmath8 .    from another perspective a linear positive map @xmath9 , @xmath10=\\alpha \\lambda[\\rho]+\\beta\\lambda[\\sigma]$ ] , @xmath11\\geq 0 \\ ; \\forall\\ , \\rho\\geq 0 $ ] , can be used to detect entanglement if it is not completely positive , since the application of a non - completely positive map to an entangled state @xmath12 can result in a non - positive operator , @xmath13\\ngeq 0 $ ] .",
    "the fact that the extension of a positive map remains positive on separable states can be easily seen by applying it to the state @xmath14 in eq . .",
    "the equivalence of the two approaches was established in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors had proven that for every entangled state @xmath15 there exists a positive but non - completely positive map , @xmath16 , whose extension applied to @xmath15 maps it into an operator with negative eigenvalues .",
    "it is straightforward to generate a witness out of a positive map : if @xmath13\\ngeq 0 $ ] , it implies that there exists a pure state @xmath17 such that @xmath18)<0 $ ] .",
    "now , by invoking the concept of the dual of a map @xmath19 , uniquely defined by @xmath20)=\\text{tr}(\\lambda^*[\\rho]\\rho'),\\ ; \\forall \\rho , \\rho'$ ] , it can immediately be seen that @xmath21 $ ] is an entanglement witness detecting @xmath15 .",
    "the converse construction goes as follows .",
    "every witness @xmath8 is a block - positive operator , i.e. it is positive on product vectors : @xmath22 .",
    "this implies the positivity of the map @xmath9 whose choi matrix is @xmath8 , defined in the computational basis ( up to a constant ) by @xmath23 . if @xmath8 detects @xmath6 , then @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the ( unnormalised ) maximally entangled state on the bipartite system @xmath26 .",
    "thus , we see that the positive map @xmath27 reveals the entanglement of @xmath6 . for details , we refer the reader to @xcite . to appreciate the challenges in the multipartite case ,",
    "we first review the different levels of separability a system can exhibit .",
    "the strongest notion of separability is the complete absence of any type of entanglement , i.e. _ full separability_. an @xmath0-partite finite dimensional quantum state @xmath28 is called fully - separable , and will be denoted by @xmath14 , iff it can be decomposed as @xmath29 where as before @xmath2 is a probability distribution .",
    "if a quantum state @xmath6 can not be decomposed into the form there must be some entanglement in the system .",
    "this concept of separability can also be revealed in terms of general linear maps @xcite . however , as we have mentioned before , for multipartite systems , many levels of separability can exist , according to how many subsystems share entanglement .",
    "we now present the weakest notion of separability , usually referred to as _ biseparability _ : let @xmath30 be an @xmath0-partite quantum state and let @xmath31 denote a proper subset of the parties .",
    "a state @xmath32 is biseparable iff it can be decomposed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes a quantum state for the subsystem defined by the subset @xmath35 and @xmath36 stands for the sum over all bipartitions @xmath37 .",
    "an @xmath0-partite state which can not be decomposed as is called _",
    "genuine @xmath0-partite entangled_. if the number of parties is clear from the context , we call those states genuine multipartite entangled ( gme ) . note that since the biseparable states form a convex closed set , the hahn - banach theorem ensures that given any gme - state there exists a gme - witness detecting it .",
    "just as in the bipartite case , the witnesses of genuine multipartite entanglement ( _ gme - witnesses _ ) are defined by hermitian operators @xmath38 that , for all @xmath32 , fulfil @xmath39 and for which there exists a multipartite state @xmath6 such that @xmath40 .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction , positive maps fail to capture the concept of genuine multipartite entanglement for a simple reason : applying a positive map to any marginal subsystem @xmath35 of a biseparable state does not necessarily result in a positive operator , as it only guarantees positivity for the portion of the state which is separable with respect to the partition @xmath41 .",
    "let us remark that , for bipartite systems , the crucial point of entanglement criteria based on positive maps @xmath9 is the following : if we consider their extension @xmath42 they become non - positive maps which are nonetheless positive on all separable states , see fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "this is the point of view that allows for a straightforward multipartite generalisation .",
    "the objects we are thus looking for are non - positive maps @xmath43 such that @xmath44\\geq 0,\\quad \\forall\\,\\rho_{2-sep}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we call those maps gme - maps . in the following sections we explore the possibility of constructing such maps from the lifting of positive maps ( see fig.[diagram ] for an illustration of our concept ) .     are obtained via tensoring a positive map with the identity .",
    "the top represents the multipartite situation , where the non - positive maps @xmath43 , so called gme - maps , can in some cases be constructed from positive maps via a lifting procedure .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath45 denote the witnesses of the respective cases .",
    "the black arrows denote previously known connections , the red arrows indicate our contribution with this paper . ]",
    "in this section we present a method of developing gme criteria based on positive but not completely positive maps . before we introduce our method , we first note that it is always possible to find a gme - map , as defined in eq . , detecting a given gme - state .",
    "indeed let @xmath46 be a gme - state .",
    "then we know from @xcite that there exists a gme - witness detecting @xmath46 of the form    @xmath47    where for each partition a , @xmath16 is a positive map , @xmath48 is chosen such that @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is a positive matrix depending on the choice of @xmath16 and @xmath48 . in appendix",
    "[ app : w_gme ] , it is shown how one obtains @xmath45 in from @xcite and in particular how @xmath50 is constructed .",
    "then the map @xmath51=\\text{tr}(w_{\\text{gme } } \\cdot \\rho ) \\ ; \\mathbb{i}\\ ] ] is a gme - map detecting @xmath52 .",
    "we should also note that given any gme - map one can associate a gme - witness to each state detected by the map in the same way as done in the bipartite setting . indeed given",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath46 such that @xmath53 , there exists a pure state @xmath54 such that @xmath55 $ ] is a gme - witness .",
    "this looks all good but upon inspecting the gme - map defined by eq .",
    ", one remarks that it is only gained from positive maps in an indirect way .",
    "indeed from the family of maps @xmath56 ( bottom left of fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) , a family of bipartite witnesses @xmath57 was first associated ( bottom right of fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) , from which a gme - witness was extracted ( top right of fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) .",
    "this gme - witness finally defined the non - positive map @xmath58 of eq .",
    "( top left of fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) .",
    "now , our goal is to explore a direct lifting method , illustrated by the red arrow from @xmath59 to @xmath43 in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] , from positive maps to gme maps , without passing through the witnesses .",
    "the reason for pursuing this is that gme - maps of the form of eq .",
    "are quite trivial in the sense that the boundary of the set @xmath60 is a hyperplane rather than the boundary of a more complex convex set , which could possibly explore more subtleties of genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "inspiring ourselves from the structure of @xmath45 in eq .",
    ", our goal is to seek for maps of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a positive map , @xmath63:=\\sum_i p_i^{(a ) } \\ , u_i^{(a)}\\rho   \\left ( u_i^{(a)}\\right)^\\dagger$ ] is a family of convex combinations of local unitaries , and @xmath64\\geq 0 $ ] @xmath65 . in appendix [ app.generalphi ]",
    "we derive some general conditions as to when one can ensure that for a given gme - state a gme - map of the form of eq . detecting this gme - state exists .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear from those conditions whether the construction of @xmath66 via lifting of positive maps is general enough , that is , whether for every gme - state @xmath46 , there exists a gme - map of the form of eq . detecting @xmath46 .",
    "after those general considerations , we want to give in the remaining of the manuscript concrete examples of our method by exhibiting gme - maps constructed via the lift of positive but non - completely positive maps .",
    "our first example is possibly the most naive attempt , where we set @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the transposition , in a tripartite setting , and find the value of @xmath70 for which @xmath43 defined by eq . is a gme - map .",
    "that is , we consider the map @xmath71=(t_a \\otimes \\mathbb{i}_b \\otimes \\mathbb{i}_c + \\mathbb{i}_a \\otimes t_b \\otimes \\mathbb{i}_c   + \\mathbb{i}_a \\otimes \\mathbb{i}_b \\otimes t_c   + c \\,\\mathbb{i}\\cdot \\text{tr})[\\cdot].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ thmphit ] for @xmath72 it holds that for all tripartite biseparable states @xmath73 @xmath74 \\geq 0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and this value of @xmath70 is optimal , i.e. it is the least compatible with the above constraint .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thmphit ] consists in determining the minimal eigenvalue of the operators @xmath75 , which turns out to be @xmath76 for any partition @xmath35 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed proof of theorem [ thmphit ] is presented in appendix [ aproofphit ] .",
    "the intuition behind this construction rests upon the prerequisite that the negative eigenstates under application of partial transposition for every cut have at least some nonzero overlap . as we will see in the following examples",
    ", some states will exhibit this property and the map works in a straightforward way . the additional unitary transformation in eq.([eq : phidef ] )",
    "is supposed to systematically map the corresponding negative eigenstates into the same space , opening up the possibility to detect many more states .",
    "we will see that such unitary corrections can be readily constructed , but their success depends also on the symmetries exhibited by the state .    to start ,",
    "let us consider an example where the map directly works .",
    "if we consider the state @xmath77 we find @xmath78\\ngeq 0 $ ] with negative eigenvalue @xmath79 and therefore @xmath80 provides a gme criterion .",
    "the map @xmath80 can detect the noisy @xmath8 state , @xmath81 , for @xmath82 .",
    "+ the map @xmath80 can be modified to detect the @xmath83 state , by choosing @xmath84 , where @xmath85=\\prod_{i\\in a}{\\sigma_x}_i\\otimes \\mathbb{i}_{\\bar{i}}\\rho\\prod_{i\\in a}{\\sigma_x}_i\\otimes \\mathbb{i}_{\\bar{i}}$ ] .",

    "since we only added a local unitary operation , the map @xmath89 remains positive on all biseparable states .",
    "one calculates @xmath90\\ngeq 0 $ ] with negative eigenvalue @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , @xmath89 is also a gme - map and it detects the noisy ghz state more robustly than @xmath80 detects the @xmath8 state .",
    "the reason why the map @xmath89 successfully detects the @xmath83 state , as opposed to @xmath80 , is that by composing the transposition with the unitary operation @xmath88 we are exploring the symmetries of the state : note that the off - diagonal elements of the @xmath83 state remain invariant under the application of partial transposition followed by the pauli matrix @xmath88 .",
    "further considerations of symmetry will be made in section [ sec : choi ] .",

    "the map @xmath80 can also be similarly generalised for @xmath0 parties , however , already for @xmath99 , the @xmath0-partite @xmath8 state is no more detected by it .",
    "we therefore see that this construction although generating gme - maps , does not provide a noise resistant detection .",
    "this might have two causes , namely the choice of the positive map or the naive choice of m. see sections [ sec : diagm ] or [ sec : choi ] for less naive constructions .      in this section",
    "we will modify the map @xmath100 of section [ sec : trans ] by looking at a slightly better choice for the correction map @xmath62 .",
    "this will enable us to detect the ghz state with an optimal noise resistance .",
    "we will choose @xmath101 , where here @xmath102 and @xmath103 $ ] maps @xmath6 to a diagonal matrix with the same elements as @xmath6 .",
    "hence we look at the map @xmath104    we also want to project our n - qubit state onto a subspace before applying @xmath105 to it . the subspace we want to project onto is @xmath106 where for @xmath107 , with @xmath108 and @xmath109 , we have @xmath110 the class of states invariant under the projection onto subspace is also known as x - states @xcite , and genuine multipartite entanglement in this class of states was fully characterised in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the notation is more extensively explained in section [ sec : choi ] . as we are going to see in proposition [ prop - main ] in section [ sec : choi ] , it turns out that one can project onto this subspace via a mixture of local unitaries ( the assertion holds for any @xmath111 but for now we are interested in the case @xmath112 ) , thus ensuring that no entanglement is created in the process .",

    "this means that for @xmath167 and @xmath0 big enough , our map detects the @xmath0-qudit ghz state with up to almost @xmath168 white noise .",
    "furthermore , since our map is based on the non - decomposable choi - map it can also detect genuine multipartite entanglement in systems which are positive under partial transposition with respect to any bipartition . to illustrate that we can consider the family of 3-qutrit states @xmath169 introduced in ref .",
    "these states are obtained by setting @xmath170 in the definition of eq .",
    "( 13 ) of ref . @xcite . more explicitly , for @xmath171 @xmath172 where the @xmath173 are defined in eq .",
    "( 19 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . in any case , the states @xmath174 have the property to be invariant under partial transposition , therefore partial transposition based criteria can not even detect bipartite entanglement . by applying our map",
    "we recover the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , showing that the states @xmath174 are gme for @xmath175 , which to our knowledge is still the best known detection range .",
    "setting @xmath176 , the noisy state @xmath177 is detected with our criteria with white noise up to @xmath178 . apart from refs .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite we are not aware of any gme detection technique powerful enough to achieve this feature .",
    "+ we have just seen that our choi based criteria is able to detect the @xmath0-qudit ghz state with incredible white noise resistance for big enough @xmath0 .",
    "it can also detect sates that are ppt with respect to every cut with the best known white noise resistance .",
    "it is thus fair to say that our scheme enabled us to derive a strong criterion .",
    "the key for obtaining such a criterion was to explore the symmetries of the choi - map , namely that it acts the same on every off - diagonal element of a state , and to be able to project in a subspace , @xmath179 , exhibiting this symmetry without creating any entanglement .",
    "we believe that this strategy can be applied to other maps , such as the breuer - hall map to cite only one .",
    "one then is left with the task of identifying the symmetry that characterizes the map , and more difficultly to find a way of making a projection into a subspace exhibiting this symmetry without creating any entanglement . in order to shed some light to the possibility of accomplishing the second step of this process",
    ", we include an alternative proof of proposition [ prop - main ] in appendix [ aprojection ] . indeed ,",
    "since the alternative proof is based on group theory , we believe it will be easier to adapt it to a map having another symmetry .",
    "in this manuscript we investigate the generalisation of the bipartite concept of positive maps to gme - maps in order to detect genuine multipartite entanglement , therefore closing a gap in the set of available tools for revealing gme .",
    "we introduce a general method of constructing gme - maps based on positive but non - completely positive maps .",
    "we have furthermore illustrated our construction method by generalising the paradigmatic ppt criterion to the multipartite case .",
    "as a first application , we showed that our approach provides a novel solution to the problem of determining the bi - separability threshold of ghz mixtures .",
    "moreover , by exploring the symmetries of the choi - map we were able to design a very robust criterion ( for ghz - like states ) , which can recover the results of some of the strongest known criteria and even reveal entanglement in states that are ppt with respect to every partition .",
    "we are therefore strongly convinced that this construction could be a first step on a path to a better understanding of gme , even if only for the sole purpose to derive new gme - witnesses by lifting known positive maps to gme - maps . + there are , however , still many open questions concerning our construction . in the bipartite case ,",
    "one of the upsides of the approach based on positive maps is that in some cases it is possible to achieve local unitary invariance of the resulting criteria ( as with ppt ) .",
    "this also directly leads to the fact that every entangled pure state can easily be detected by this one simple map .",
    "now the question that arises here is analogous : can there be a single multipartite map that reveals gme for all locally unitarily related ( or even all ) gme pure states ? while our maps are performing very strongly in terms of noise resistance and can even detect states which are ppt with respect to every bipartition , they are not local unitary invariant and will probably fail to reveal gme of all gme pure states .",
    "the main challenge appears due to the fact that the negative eigenstates under every partition need to mutually overlap , in order for the construction to work .",
    "the lack of a unique schmidt decomposition for multipartite systems and the hardness of computing the tensor rank make this a tough challenge , that we were only able to overcome in scenarios with a high degree of symmetry .",
    "moreover , from a more technical point of view , in order to develop new examples of the maps we propose it would be crucial to have a general method of deriving a valid , nontrivial , compensation map @xmath62 , without having to first project into a subspace of the multipartite system ( as in this way we expect to miss many important features and focus only on a small niche of the richness of gme correlations ) .    finally , an important open point is whether every gme state can be detected by a gme - map lifted from positive maps . for the gme - witnesses",
    "a similar construction method was indeed recently shown to suffice to reveal the entanglement of any gme - state @xcite . in our case",
    "it is unfortunately not clear if the restrictions exposed in proposition [ prop : condphi ] of appendix [ app.generalphi ] still enable to detect every gme - state .",
    "an affirmative answer would show that among all the gme - maps , one would only need to consider the ones lifted from positive maps to fully characterize genuine multipartite entanglement , thus greatly simplifying the search for such maps .",

    "similarly , the matrix representing where all the ( k ) of the topmost column and ( -k ) of the leftmost row meet can be written as @xmath306 . in general , for @xmath307 , the matrix representing where all the @xmath308 of the topmost column and @xmath309 of the leftmost row meet can be written as @xmath310 . those matrices represent all the entries where @xmath296 has ones .",
    "the other entries of this matrix have a phase @xmath308 for some @xmath307 . when summing over all the @xmath311 we have @xmath312 such that we have @xmath313 this proves the claim for @xmath290 .",
    "for @xmath314 notice that @xmath315    assuming that we are working in the following basis of @xmath316 : @xmath317 we define the basis transformation @xmath318 by @xmath319 @xmath320 this has the effect of exchanging the subspaces 2 and k. indeed we have @xmath321 and hence @xmath322 where @xmath323 .",

    "although this way of proving proposition [ prop - main ] gives great insights into how the projection is concretely performed , we would like to present an alternative way of proving it that , using a group theoretical approach , puts more emphasis on the symmetries of the ghz cyclically permuted states that are made used of here , i.e. the symmetry of the choi map .",
    "let @xmath329 be a compact group whose associated haar integral we denote by @xmath330 .",
    "given a unitary representation @xmath331 of @xmath329 on a finite  dimensional complex hilbert space , an interesting super - operator is given by the expression @xmath332 where @xmath333 acts on linear operators @xmath334 as @xmath335 .",
    "the super - operator @xmath336 given by is an orthogonal projector with respect to the hilbert ",
    "schmidt product on @xmath337 .",
    "moreover , let the irreducible decomposition of @xmath337 under the action of @xmath338 be given by @xmath339 with @xmath340 irreducible for all @xmath341 and @xmath342 inequivalent if @xmath343 .",

    "the above observation is just a slightly more sophisticated application of schur s lemma .    in our case , we choose @xmath348 and @xmath349 , where @xmath350 is the group of integers with the operation of sum modulo @xmath130 .",
    "the haar integral over @xmath329 is simply the normalized sum , i.e. @xmath351 . for @xmath352 , we define @xmath353 then , it is not difficult to see that @xmath354 as defined by eq .",

    "now , all we have to do is to decompose @xmath338 in irreducible representations ( irreps ) , all one - dimensional because @xmath329 is abelian . for all @xmath355 , we observe that @xmath356 satisfies @xmath357 i.e. it is an irreducible subspace for @xmath338 .",
    "it turns out that the irreps of @xmath329 are all present in @xmath338 and indexed by @xmath358 , and each of them has multiplicity @xmath130 ( internal index @xmath359 ) .",
    "this can be easily seen by verifying that the characters of @xmath356 and @xmath360 are orthogonal if @xmath361 , and by remembering that the number of non - isomorphic irreps of an abelian group coincides with its cardinality ( @xmath362 in this case ) .",
