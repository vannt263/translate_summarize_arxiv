    "the strength of the emission in the first ultraviolet spectrum of a giant star , @xmath2  boo , was found to be surprisingly strong ( moos & rottman 1972 ) and was subsequently understood to result from ly-@xmath3 pumping as proposed by bowen ( haisch et al .",

    "the temperature distributions for these models are shown in figure 1 and discussed below .",
    "this model in hydrostatic equilibrium exhibits a monotonically decreasing temperature with height . the kurucz model ( castelli and kurucz 2004 )",
    "was calculated specifically for the stellar parameters listed above .",
    "values of turbulent broadening are introduced to match the observed width of the balmer lines in the stars .",
    "the rce model does not produce good fits to the balmer line profiles .",
    "it has long been known ( dupree et al . 1984 ) that the rce approximation is not expected to match the observed profiles because balmer lines have a chromospheric component .",
    "the construction of a semi - empirical chromospheric model ( chr ) relies on matching appropriate line profiles .",
    "the h@xmath2  and h@xmath3 lines are useful in this regard since the atmospheric levels of profile formation span a large temperature region in low gravity stars ( mszaros et al .",

    "1 ) to produce good agreement with the h@xmath2  and h@xmath3 line profiles ( fig .",
    "these profiles originate from the high photosphere in the wings of the line , traverse the temperature minimum , and arise from the low chromosphere in the line core as shown in fig .",

    "are also included to evaluate the oxygen ionization and excitation .    a recent calculation of oxygen in metal - poor stars using a 3d rce model ( amarsi et al .",
    "2016 ) notes the importance of the ly-@xmath2  wings in photoexcitation of the oxygen resonance lines . a rce model , lacking a chromosphere will not produce an accurate lyman continuum value nor a realistic ly-@xmath2  profile , so its influence is difficult to assess . in addition , the ly-@xmath2  profile needs to be calculated with partial frequency distribution which will lower the flux in the line wings .",
    "unfortunately , the ly-@xmath2  profile is challenging to measure directly because of interstellar absorption and geocoronal emission .",
    "line profiles for three oxygen transitions are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the chr solutions are stronger than the rce / lte profiles for all transitions .",
    "the forbidden transitions reach optical depth unity deep in the atmosphere where higher densities and greater collisional coupling occurs . however , the levels are not in their lte population ratios where the forbidden lines are formed ( fig .",
    "the strengthening of the triplet transition has been noted previously in rce models by a number of authors ( takeda 2003 , fabbian et al .",
    "2009 ) , but the chromospheric model strengthens the lines to a greater degree .    to evaluate the sensitivity of the line strength to the chr model , we changed the temperature over the region of formation of the oxygen lines in steps of 100k extending @xmath13500k from the model . in order to be acceptable ,",
    "the h@xmath2  and h@xmath3 lines are well replicated ( their equivalent widths changed by only @xmath42% ) .",
    "the equivalent widths of the oxygen lines changed by an average of 9% for these models suggesting that the strength of the oxygen lines depends principally on the abundance of oxygen . if ly-@xmath3 pumping is omitted , the equivalent widths of the triplet decrease by @xmath4 20% . in conclusion ,",
    "the model is reasonably fixed by the hydrogen lines and changing the temperature where the oxygen lines are formed creates a negligible difference in the equivalent widths of the oxygen lines .    the calculated profiles for 3 values of the o abundance ( fig .",
    "4 ) are compared to observations of the omega cen giants , leid 54064 and leid 54084 .",
    "equivalent widths from the models are given in table 1 .",
    "the spectra from magellan / mike have s / n reaching 100 - 200 , but the oxygen lines are weak , and the forbidden lines are challenged by blending with other atomic lines , telluric lines ( @xmath06300 ) , and a continuum marred by a broad autoionizing line of ( @xmath06362 ) . however , the observations of both forbidden transitions and the triplet indicate generally consistent agreement with model profiles having similar values of the oxygen abundance",
    ". synthesis of the @xmath06300 transition ( johnson and pilachowski 2010 ) for leid 54064 and leid 54084 suggests log o / h=7.53 and 7.63 respectively where log h=12.00 . from our chr model ,",
    "the @xmath07775 multiplet yields log o / h = 7.04 in leid 54064 , a reduction of @xmath40.5 dex ; the forbidden transitions and the @xmath07775 multiplet in leid 54084 also appear consistent with a low abundance : @xmath47.1 , a reduction also by @xmath40.5 dex .",
    "these chr models eliminate the abundance differences found ( takeda 2003 ) between forbidden and triplet lines using rce / nlte models .",
    "the abundance changes suggested here by the 1d chr / nlte model are larger for both the forbidden and triplet transitions than those deduced from 3d / nlte photospheric models of a subgiant star ( amarsi et al .",
    "2015 ) which indicate essentially no change in the abundance from the forbidden lines when compared to 1d / lte models and a more modest correction ( @xmath140.14 dex ) for the triplet .",
    "adoption of a stellar atmospheric model with a chromosphere , in a 1d non - lte calculation of level populations and line strengths for , including photoexcitation by ly@xmath3 affects both the forbidden transitions ( 6300  and 6363 ) as well as the triplet transition ( 77717775 ) .",
    "these transitions are systematically changed as compared to a rce model : a chromosphere strengthens both the forbidden transitions and the triplet transitions . with the ( slightly )",
    "increased temperature in the chr model , higher levels of are populated .",
    "these results challenge the often cited statement ( kiselman 2001 ) that the forbidden lines ( @xmath06300 and @xmath06363 ) can be analyzed with an lte approximation .",
    "while this may be true for a photospheric model , the presence of a chromosphere increases the forbidden lines substantially .",
    "thus `` lte abundances '' will overestimate the true oxygen abundance by a factor of @xmath43 in these stars .",
    "our results suggest that the inferred oxygen abundance is decreased when a chr model is invoked . since differing h - alpha profiles and variation in h - alpha profiles in red giants suggest intrinsic changes in the dynamics , and most likely the temperature and density structure of the stellar atmosphere , it is reasonable to expect that such changes signal different chromospheric structures and the strengths of the oxygen lines may also differ between similar metal - poor red giants .",
    "of course there is no reason to believe that the absolute abundance of o changes due to chromospheric variability in a given star .",
    "chromospheres in metal - poor field stars are anomalously ` strong ' considering the lower metal abundance of these objects , and the chromospheric radiative losses do not appear to scale with metallicity ( dupree et al .",
    "since chromospheric structures can differ , we conjecture that the correction for the oxygen abundance may not have a constant value , even for similar stars",
    ". thus one might expect that a na / o anticorrelation may ` spread out ' due to chromospheric variation .",
    "further calculations are necessary to explore these effects .",
    "the distribution could become bimodal or multimodal much as photometry reveals multiple populations in clusters .",
    "metal - poor giants in the field do not display the typical na - o anti - correlation found in globular cluster giants ( kraft 1994 ) . a possible decrease in",
    "the oxygen abundance could suggest ( gratton et al . 2000 ) that deep mixing episodes occur on the upper red giant branch to bring processed material from the cno cycle to the surface ; alternatively , abundance patterns might be attibuted to the initial composition of the star - forming material from a previous generation of more massive stars .",
    "the effects of non - lte and chromospheres have been considered for dwarf stars of solar metallicity .",
    "maderak et al .",
    "( 2013 ) concludes that oxygen abundances derived from the triplet using photospheric models , if corrected for non - lte , may be reliable for solar - type dwarf stars with solar metallicities .",
    "recent calculations of the triplet for a solar model including a chromosphere suggest less than 1.5% difference in the equivalent widths for a non - lte calculation ( dobrovolskas et al .",
    "however , it is not stated whether lyman-@xmath3 pumping was included , and the case of low metallicities remains to be considered .",
    "multiple populations in globular clusters and their origin are also assessed in part by oxygen abundances .",
    "a decrease in the o / h abundance of @xmath40.5 dex , has the potential to affect many abundance relationships ( cf .",
    "3 , gratton et al . 2012 ) and in particular the important na / o anti - correlations . if all oxygen abundances in cluster giants were to be uniformly reduced by 0.5 dex , this would imply that the oxygen yield from type ii sn ( nomoto et al .",
    "2006 ) is overestimated and can not satisfy the abundance patterns .",
    "an increase in the contribution of agb stars of @xmath45m@xmath11 would appear to be necessary ( johnson and pilachowski 2010 ) .",
    "our two target stars have similar oxygen abundances , but different values of na / fe , thus challenging the na - o anti - correlations .",
    "sodium is enhanced in the he - rich star ( leid 54084 ) .",
    "johnson and pilachowski ( 2010 ) found [ na / fe]=+0.25 ( leid 54084 ) and [ na / fe]=+0.16 ( leid 54064 ) . another determination ( dupree et al . 2011 ) for the same stars , yielded [ na / fe]=+0.37 ( leid 54084 ) and [ na / fe]=@xmath10.14 ( leid 54064 ) .",
    "the sense of the variation agrees between both determinations , but the difference is larger from the later result .",
    "the typical abundance pattern suggests that enhanced he accompanies enhanced na , and enhanced na should correlate with a lower o abundance ( gratton et al .",
    "2012 ) which it does not in these two target stars .",
    "abundance patterns in the two target stars are consistent with respect to he and na , but display similar lowered oxygen abundances .",
    "however a note of caution emerges in that the radial distribution of the abundances in omega centauri differs between oxygen and sodium ( johnson & pilachowski 2010 ) suggesting that a clean anti - correlation may actually not exist .",
    "accurate abundance values may shed light on the discreteness of photometry of globular clusters versus the continuity of abundance determinations ( milone et al . 2015 ; renzini et al . 2015 ) .",
    "a wider range of chr models can address the precise abundances necessary for understanding the hosts of exoplanets ( bedell et al .",
    "2014 ; teske et al .",
    "other elements merit analysis with realistic chromospheric models too such as , , , and . to follow up these results , a broader array of models must be evaluated . at present",
    ", we can not assume the structure of a stellar chromosphere _ a priori _ , but it must be constrained by spectroscopic observations of the transitions typical of chromospheric temperatures : , , h@xmath2 , na d , etc .",
    "a confounding parameter could be activity variations : the chromosphere itself changes structure and the impact on the oxygen line strengths needs to be assessed .",
    "thus differential abundances could be suspect . if a chromosphere results from magnetic dynamo activity , one might suggest that older , metal - poor stars would experience a decay in activity .",
    "however , a temperature rise could result from pulsations and shock formation .",
    "in luminous metal - poor stars , the h@xmath2  line emission varies in strength and asymmetry ( cf .",
    "mszros et al .",
    "2009 ) , most likely from modest pulsations .",
    "in addition , weak magnetic fields detected in luminous stars ( cf . landstreet 2015 ) could be present in the oldest stars and cause heating ( musielak et al .",
    "2002 ) . in any case",
