    "in recent years , the luminosity distance of supernovae type ia perlmutter , wide surveys on galaxies @xcite and the anisotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite confirm that the expansion of our universe is currently undergoing a period of acceleration .",
    "large scale structure formation @xcite , baryon oscillations @xcite and weak lensing @xcite also suggest such an accelerated expansion of the universe . identifying the cause of this late time acceleration is one of the most challenging problems of modern cosmology .",
    "theoretical physicists desire to interpret this accelerated expansion in a suitable gravitational background and they proposed some candidates . a positive cosmological constant can lead to accelerated expansion of the universe but it is plagued by the fine tuning problem @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant may be interpreted either geometrically as modifying the left hand side of einstein s equation or as a kinematic term on the right hand side with the equation of state parameter @xmath2 .",
    "another approach can further be generalized by considering a source term with an equation of state parameter @xmath3 .",
    "such kinds of source terms have collectively come to be known as dark energy .",
    "various scalar field models of dark energy have been considered in literature @xcite .",
    "all the dark energy based theories assume that the observed acceleration is the outcome of the action of a still unknown ingredient added to the cosmic pie . in terms of the einstein equations",
    ", such models are simply modifying the right hand side including in the stress ",
    "energy tensor with something more than the usual matter and radiation components .",
    "on the other hand , one can also try to leave unchanged the source side , but rather than modifying the left hand side of einstein field equations . in a sense ,",
    "one is therefore interpreting cosmic acceleration as a first signal of the breakdown of the laws of physics as described by the standard general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "there are different branches of modified gravity with various motivations .",
    "lovelock gravity @xcite , brane world cosmology @xcite , scalar - tensor theories @xcite and also the so - called @xmath4 gravity @xcite are some of modified gravity theories .    modifying gr ,",
    "not simply given its positive results , opens the way to a large class of alternative theories of gravity ranging from extra dimensions @xcite to non - minimally coupled scalar fields @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will be interested here in fourth order theories capozziello based on replacing the scalar curvature r in the hilbert ",
    "einstein action with a generic analytic function f(r ) which should be reconstructed starting from data and physically motivated issues .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in @xmath1 gravity .",
    "but as we know the field equations of @xmath1 gravity are complicated fourth - order differential equations , and it is not easy to find exact analytical solutions .",
    "in addition , adding stress - tensor of a matter field to @xmath1 gravity , increase its difficulties .",
    "recently , it has been shown that one can extract exact analytical solutions of @xmath1 theory coupled to a traceless energy momentum tensor with constant curvature scalar @xcite .",
    "for example , taking into account the conformally invariant maxwell ( cim ) field as a matter source , which is traceless in arbitrary dimensions , some black objects of @xmath1 gravity were obtained in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , one of the interesting subjects for recent study is the investigation of three dimensional black holes @xcite .",
    "taking into account three dimensional solutions helps us to find a profound insight in the black hole physics , quantum view of gravity and also its relations to string theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , three dimensional spacetimes perform an essential role to improve our understanding of gravitational interaction in low dimensional manifolds @xcite . due to these facts ,",
    "some of physicists have an interest in the @xmath0-dimensional manifolds and their attractive properties @xcite .",
    "although three dimensional black holes in @xmath1 gravity have been studied before @xcite , till now , exact solution of three dimensional @xmath4 gravity coupled to a matter field have not been constructed . in this paper ,",
    "one of our goals is obtaining an exact three dimensional black hole solutions of @xmath1 theory coupled to a cim source .",
    "the coupling of nonlinear sources and general relativity attract the significant attentions because of their specific properties .",
    "interesting properties of various nonlinear electrodynamics have been studied before @xcite .",
    "one of the special class of the nonlinear electrodynamics sources is pmi , which its lagrangian is an arbitrary power of maxwell lagrangian @xcite .",
    "this model is considerably richer than maxwell theory and in the special case ( unit power ) , it reduces to linear maxwell field .",
    "another attractive feature of the pmi theory is its conformal invariance when the power of maxwell invariant is a quarter of spacetime dimensions . in other words , for the special choice @xmath5",
    ", one obtains traceless energy - momentum tensor which leads to conformal invariance .",
    "it is notable that the idea is to take advantage of the conformal symmetry to construct the analogues of the four dimensional reissner - nordstrm solutions with an inverse square electric field in arbitrary dimensions @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that one can , simultaneously , extract electric charge and cosmological constant from pure @xmath1 gravity ( without matter field : @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
