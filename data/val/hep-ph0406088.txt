    "for decades the naturalness ( or hierarchy ) problem of the higgs mass term has been the guiding principle to construct theories beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the criterion of naturalness has the exciting implication that the sm should stop to be valid at a scale around the tev , and new dynamics should occur at energies reachable by present or near - future colliders .",
    "although no clear indications for any sm failure at electroweak energies has emerged so far , a conclusive resolution of this issue has to wait for the lhc .    from a field - theoretical point of view , the cosmological constant problem appears to be very similar to the naturalness problem of the higgs mass , since both of them are related to ultraviolet power divergences .",
    "the same naturalness criterion , applied to the cosmological costant , leads to the existence of a threshold of new dynamics at @xmath0  ev .",
    "we do not know if some hidden dynamics actually takes place at that scale , or if the resolution of the problem comes without any modification of the dynamics .",
    "what we know is that present particle physics calculations , valid at energies much larger than @xmath0  ev , can be safely performed by setting the cosmological constant to zero and ignore any effect caused by the mechanism ultimately responsible for the solution of the problem .",
    "this fact has been justified by invoking the anthropic principle  @xcite , which could be operating in presence of a large number of meta - stable vacua , as in string theory  @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable to ponder whether such an explanation could also apply to the hierarchy problem , imagining a mechanism ( not necessarily based on the anthropic principle ) which allows to extrapolate sm calculations to energies much larger than the tev , without the need of introducing new dynamics , besides the higgs .    at first sight",
    ", this sounds like a devastating proposal .",
    "but , if we are willing to abandon the hierarchy problem , we can try to use other clues to drive the search for the theory beyond the sm .",
    "gauge coupling unification could be one such clue : it is motivated by a theory that addresses questions related to the fundamental structure of the sm particle content .",
    "the failure of exact unification of gauge couplings in the sm suggests the existence of new particles , belonging to incomplete gut irreps , which mend the mismatch .",
    "it is well known that low - energy supersymmetry provides precisely the necessary particles with the appropriate quantum numbers .",
    "recently , arkani - hamed and dimopoulos  @xcite , setting aside the hierarchy problem , have noticed that gauge - coupling unification can be achieved in a supersymmetric model where all scalars , but one higgs doublet , are much heavier than the electroweak scale .",
    "most of the unpleasent aspects of supersymmetry ( excessive flavour and cp violation , fast dimension-5 proton decay , tight constraints on the higgs mass ) are eliminated , but the unification is retained .    if supersymmetry plays no rle in solving the hierarchy problem , there is no reason to insist that the spectrum is ( partially ) supersymmetric .",
    "therefore , in this paper we perform a general analysis of the particle content that has to be added to the sm to obtain gauge - coupling unification .",
    "we assume that the new particles have masses around the weak scale , and postulate the absence of thresholds at intermediate energies or various stages of gauge symmetry breaking",
    ". why should the new states appear at the weak scale , if the hierarchy problem is not the guiding principle of the analysis ?    here we can use a second observational clue : the evidence for dark matter and the observation that a particle with weak cross section and mass around the fermi scale is a natural candidate for it .",
    "we stress that the unification and dark - matter arguments are not in general sufficient to insure that new physics be within the lhc discovery reach , contrary to the naturalness criterion .",
    "nevertheless , as we will show in our analysis , in some cases there are interesting experimental consequences to be investigated .    in particular , as explained in sect .",
    "[ versus ] , we find that the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which we call split supersymmetry , emerges as more justified than other non - supersymmetric scenarios .",

    "next , we link the gaugino and higgsino masses to the weak scale by computing the relic abundance of the lightest neutralino and by requiring that it constitutes the dark matter .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss signals at high - energy colliders .",
    "in this section we want to classify all possible particle contents that lead to a successful gauge - coupling unification , under the two following assumptions : _ ( i ) _ grand unification into a simple group occurs with no intermediate stages of symmetry breaking ; _ ( ii ) _",

    "once we introduce new particles at the weak scale to obtain gauge - coupling unification , we encounter several problems .",
    "split supersymmetry seems to have partial answers to several of them .",
    "let us briefly analyse them .    _",
    "( i ) splitting of gut irreps .",
    "_ gauge - coupling unification requires the addition of new incomplete gut multiplets .",
    "it is not always natural in a gut to obtain the appropriate content of light particles .",
    "this is nothing else than the old doublet - triplet splitting problem for the higgs multiplet . in split",
    "supersymmetry , once the necessary higgs doublet - triplet splitting is achieved , no other incomplete matter multiplets are necessary .",
    "supersymmetry plays a crucial rle in relating the content of gauginos to the incomplete irrep of gauge bosons , and higgsinos to higgs .    _",
    "( ii ) light fermions .",
    "_ to maintain vector - like fermions light , the theory should posess some approximate global symmetries .",
    "supersymmetry has the advantage of having some of this symmetries already built in .",
    "gaugino and higgsino masses can be protected , even after soft supersymmetry breaking , by an @xmath95-symmetry and a pq symmetry , related to the origin of the @xmath96 term  @xcite .",
    "we will show that actually , in the effective theory , only a linear combination of the two symmetries survives , but this is sufficient to protect gaugino and higgsino masses .    _",
    "( iii ) existence and stability of dark matter .",
    "_ in this framework , dark matter provides the link with the electroweak scale .",
    "therefore the existence and stability of a weakly - interacting neutral particle is a crucial ingredient .",
    "supersymmetry has these features built in , because of the @xmath95-parity , which can be a low - energy consequence of a gut gauge symmetry .    _",
    "( iv ) instability of coloured particles .",
    "_ we have seen that the condition for one - step unification and proton stability requires the existence of new coloured particles at the electroweak scale .",
    "if these particles are stable , they could be present today , bound in nuclei , and they would appear as anomalously heavy isotopes .",
    "their relic abundance is quite uncertain , because it depends on the mechanism of hadronization and of nuclear binding  @xcite .",
    "however , even allowing for the most conservative estimates , stable coloured particles are ruled out by searches for heavy hydrogen isotopes , which excludes that their number per nucleon is larger than @xmath97 for a mass up to 1  tev  @xcite and @xmath98 up to 10  tev  @xcite .",
    "the decay of the new coloured particles could arise from mixing with ordinary quarks through renormalizable interactions .",
    "however this mixing typically introduces unwanted flavour violations , and it is tightly constrained . if the decay occurs through a non - renormalizable 4-fermion interaction with scale @xmath99 , the lifetime of the coloured particle with mass @xmath100 is ( 4)^3 ( ) ^5 ( ) ^4  0.4  gyr .",
    "thus , the decay of the coloured particle requires either a small parameter or a new threshold at an intermediate scale smaller than about @xmath101 , which can modify the gauge - coupling evolution . in split",
    "supersymmetry , the intermediate threshold is provided by the squark and slepton masses , which mediate gluino decay .",
    "this threshold consists of a complete gut irrep ( apart from the heavy higgs doublet ) and therefore does not ( much ) affect the unification condition . as long as the mechanism of supersymmetry",
    "breaking explains the existence of two widely separated scales , the gluino stability does not pose a problem .",
    "because of the interesting features of split supersymmetry , we proceed to investigate it in more detail .",
    "the spectrum of split supersymmetry contains the higgsino components @xmath102 , the gluino ( @xmath103 ) , the w - ino ( @xmath104 ) and b - ino ( @xmath105 ) , and the sm particles with one higgs doublet . the most general renormalizable lagrangian with a matter parity , besides gauge - invariant kinetic terms",

    "these states are assumed to be heavy and , for simplicity , we will assume them to be all degenerate with mass @xmath107 .",
    "the coupling constants of the effective theory at the scale @xmath107 are obtained by matching the lagrangian in with the interaction terms of the supersymmetric higgs doublets @xmath108 and @xmath109 , _ susy&= & - ( h_u^^a h_u + h_d^^a h_d ) ^2 - ( h_u^h_u - h_d^h_d ) ^2 + & & + ^u_ijh_u^t_i q_j -^d_ijh_d^t_i q_j -^e_ijh_e^t_i _ j + & & - ( g ^a w^a + g^ ) h_u - ( g ^a w^a -g^ ) h_d + h.c .

    "[ condg ]    in the context of a supersymmetric theory it is possible to argue that the gaugino masses @xmath113 or the higgsino mass @xmath96 are much smaller than the typical scale because they are protected by an @xmath95-symmetry and a pq symmetry , respectively . however , the symmetries of the effective lagrangian in are not enhanced if we set @xmath114 or @xmath115 , separately .",
    "this is because supersymmetry has been explicitly broken by eliminating the scalar fields .",
    "nevertheless , if we simultaneously set @xmath116 , the effective theory remains invariant under the product of an @xmath95-symmetry ( with @xmath95-charges @xmath117=2 $ ] , @xmath118=0 $ ] ) and a supersymmetric pq symmetry ( with charges @xmath119=pq[h_d]=-1 $ ] ) . in other words , is invariant under a global @xmath120 symmetry with charges @xmath121=s[{\\tilde w}]=s[h]=-s[{\\tilde h}_d]/2 $ ] , @xmath122=0 $ ] , and with quarks and leptons with the appropriate charges .",
    "this symmetry is spontaneously broken by the higgs vev and explicitly broken by @xmath113 or @xmath96 .",
    "this result shows that the choice of keeping only light gauginos or light higgsinos , but not both of them simultaneously , is not radiatively stable .",
    "it is interesting that the only consistent choice ( forgetting the tuning of the higgs mass ) of splitting the supersymmetric spectrum is the one that successfully reproduces gauge - coupling unification .",
    "another consequence of this result is that the @xmath96 parameter mixes with @xmath123 under renormalization effects , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ seccou ] .",
    "a particular situation occurs when @xmath124 , since @xmath125 vanish in this limit .",
    "then , for @xmath115 , has an additional global symmetry ( with charges ( @xmath126=[{\\tilde w}]=0 $ ] , @xmath127=[{\\tilde h}_u]= [ { \\tilde h}_d]$ ] ) .",

    "a value of @xmath107 larger than in conventional supersymmetric models improves the agreement between the theoretical prediction and experimental data .",

    "the prediction for @xmath3 is shown in .",
    "the unified mass decreases as @xmath107 grows , but the proton - decay rate from dimension-6 operators remains unobservably small , at present .",
    "we recall that proton decay through dimension-5 operators is suppressed by the large squark mass .",
    "the value of @xmath4 decreases with @xmath107 , because of the smaller particle content of split supersymmetry with respect to the ordinary case , as shown in .    before discussing the unification of bottom and @xmath132 masses ,",
    "let us discuss the running of the top yukawa coupling .",
    "it is well known that in the mssm the landau pole sets an upper limit on the top coupling , which translates in a lower limit on @xmath128 . in split",
    "supersymmetry , the landau pole is met before the unification scale for lower values of @xmath128 .",
    "this happens for two reasons .",
    "first , below @xmath133 , the yukawa coupling belongs to a theory with a single higgs doublet and it is smaller by a factor @xmath134 than in the two - higgs theory .",
    "second , the contribution of the top coupling to its evolution is smaller ( see equations in the appendix ) . as a consequence , the value of the coupling at the matching with the supersymmetric theory is smaller , and this allows a smaller value of @xmath128 .",
    "such low values of @xmath128 are not necessarily ruled out in this scenario , as the higgs mass can be made sufficiently large even for low values of @xmath128 ( see sect .",
    "[ sechig ] ) .",
    "since the model has a successful gauge - coupling unification , it is natural to study if also the bottom and @xmath132 masses can unify at the same scale .",

    "therefore , if @xmath165 , the b - ino is nearly decoupled and it annihilates too weakly in the early universe .",
