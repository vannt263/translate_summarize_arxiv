    "the understanding of critical phenomena in classical mechanics owes a great deal to the spatial representation of critical states , whereby the order parameter experiences statistical fluctuations on all length scales , due to a diverging correlation length  @xcite at the critical temperature .",
    "this scale invariance property was the starting point for one of the most powerful tools in theoretical physics , the renormalization group , which allowed rationalization of classical criticality in terms of trajectories in the space of coupling constants  @xcite . today",
    ", one frontier of research in critical phenomena lies in the quantum realm , where criticality may govern some of the most fascinating and complex properties found in strongly correlated materials or cold atoms  @xcite .",
    "one very fruitful approach is to consider quantum criticality in light of an effective classical theory in higher dimensions  @xcite , combining spatial and temporal fluctuations within the path integral formalism .",
    "quantum phase transitions are then probed through physical response functions that display a diverging correlation length in space - time . however",
    ", this point of view does not provide a full picture of the physics at play , especially since quantum criticality pertains to a singular change in a many - body ground state .",
    "developing wave - function - based approaches to strong correlations is indeed a blossoming field , ranging from quantum chemistry  @xcite to quantum information  @xcite , so that hopes are high that quantum critical states may be rationalized in a simpler way .",
    "our aim in this article is to directly study the quantum critical wave function of a simple toy - model , the sub - ohmic spin - boson hamiltonian , and to unveil some salient fingerprints of criticality in its ground state . in this standard model , to be described in further details below , a single quantized spin interacts with a continuum of bosonic modes , with a spectrum of coupling constants that vanishes with a power - law @xmath0 at low energy . for this purpose",
    ", we shall use a combination of two numerically - exact wave - function - based methods for quantum impurity models , a variational matrix - product - state approach ( vmps )  @xcite and the coherent state expansion ( cse )  @xcite .",
    "vmps is an acronym for the variational matrix - product - state ( mps ) formulation of the density matrix renomalization group ( dmrg ) , which has been established as a very powerful and flexible technique also in the context of bosonic impurity models  @xcite , and will be used as a reference .",
    "its all - purpose character makes it hard , however , to rationalize the precise content of the wave function in simple physical terms .",
    "for this reason , we implement the cse variationally , which amounts to expanding environmental states of the bath onto a discrete set of classical - like configurations , namely coherent states of the bosonic states in the bath ( note that an infinite discrete set is enough to ensure completeness of the coherent state basis  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , crucial aspects of quantum criticality can be directly inferred by reading - off the various superpositions of oscillator displacements that parametrize the set of coherent states .    for a given spin orientation of the impurity , we find that the average displacement follows a universal power law behavior at criticality , with a universal exponent controlled by the dynamical susceptibility .",
    "this behavior reflects the existence of an anomalous screening cloud , by analogy to the kondo problem  @xcite , that is driven by slowly - decaying entanglement ( at small momentum , or long distances in real space ) between the two - level system and its bosonic bath .",
    "more interestingly , the cse picture indicates that the distribution of displacements admits a finite width at the quantum critical point , although its mean value ( the cloud ) vanishes algebraically for low - energy critical modes .",
    "this observation translates physically into wide fluctuations taking place in the quantum critical regime , and can be rationalized mathematically by a finite average squeezing amplitude of the quantum critical modes ( averaged over a logarithmic energy interval ) , which we show from field theory arguments to take a constant universal value .    for the spin - boson model",
    ", we demonstrate that both the mps and cse methodologies converge to the same results up to numerical precision , both away from and at the critical point .",
    "we find that the number of coherent states required to capture quantum critical behavior on a reasonable energy range ( at least three decades ) is relatively large , of the order of a hundred .",
    "for this reason , recent investigations of the sub - ohmic model with variational cses using fewer states  @xcite failed to grasp the critical exponents found in large scale vmps calculations  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the usual kondo problem associated with the ohmic spin - boson model , the sub - ohmic case is indeed governed by two energy scales in its delocalized phase , namely the renormalized tunneling amplitude and the mass of a soft bosonic collective mode which drives the transition . capturing the critical softening",
    "requires careful and extensive numerical simulations , as we shall show by benchmarking the vmps and cse against each other .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we present the spin - boson model , its discretization on a wilson energy mesh , and the variational solution of its many - body wave function using both mps and cse representations .",
    "[ analytical ] develops the necessary analytical work that relates the dynamical critical exponent of the spin susceptibility to two important features of the wave function , the screening cloud ( namely the average displacement of the environmental state ) and the average squeezing amplitude .",
    "this allows us to elucidate the different behaviors of the wave function in both the non - critical delocalized phase and at the quantum critical point .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ comparison ] shows numerical results from the vmps and cse approaches , finding excellent agreement between each other , as well as with analytical predictions .",

    "if the parameters such as the bond dimension @xmath41 and the fock - space dimension @xmath42 are chosen appropriately large , the algorithm converges the mps to a numerically quasi - exact representation of the ground - state wavefunction .    in practice",
    ", we apply the concept of an optimal boson basis @xcite mapping the local fock basis @xmath43 to a smaller , effective bosonic basis @xmath44 for efficiency reasons .",
    "good convergence is ensured for the delocalized phase and at the quantum critical point for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "more recently , an alternative representation of bosonic environmental wave functions was proposed  @xcite , based on a simple physical picture of the energy landscape in terms of classical - like configurations .",
    "these are parametrized by multimode coherent states , @xmath48 , with @xmath49 the displacement of mode @xmath30 for the @xmath50 variational coherent state .",

    "the properties that we will consider concern the average displacement of the bath oscillators , as well as their squeezing amplitude , which can be interpreted as the variance of the oscillator displacements .",
