    "when subjected to a shear flow , ab block copolymer melts exhibit an orientational phase behaviour which is absent in equilibrium .",
    "a system under shear shows not only transitions between different morphologies ( typically lamellar , hexagonal , cubic and gyroid @xcite ) , but also transitions between different _ orientations _ of these morphologies with respect to the shear geometry .",
    "experimental literature extensively discusses this effect for lamellar @xcite and hexagonal phases @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of the lamellar reorientation was developed in @xcite .",
    "the same method was applied in @xcite to study the hexagonal pattern . in these theories",
    "orientational transitions appear as a result of interaction of shear flow with critical fluctuations in melt .",
    "there are two distinct regimes : a slow flow only slightly perturbs the fluctuation spectrum while a fast flow significantly dumps fluctuations , restoring the mean - field behaviour in the limit of infinite shear rate @xmath0 .",
    "correspondingly , the parallel lamellae ( their normal is parallel to the shear gradient direction ) are found to be stable in the small shear rate regime , while the perpendicular lamellae ( their normal is perpendicular to both the gradient and flow directions ) are stable at high shear rates .",
    "fredrickson has shown that if one takes into account the difference in viscosities of the pure melt components , the perpendicular phase loses its stability at low enough temperatures and the parallel orientation is restored .",
    "schematically this behaviour is summarized in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "however , there is an experimental evidence that this picture is not complete . at very high shear rates",
    "the parallel orientation was found to be the only stable one @xcite .",
    "this can not be explained in the discussed framework of @xcite , since it predicts the stability region for the perpendicular phase _ to increase _ as @xmath0 .    in this work",
    "we propose an explanation of the additional transition ( c - transition in fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "we argue that the missing element of the theory is the interaction of the block copolymer melt with the walls of the shear cell .",
    "we consider a block copolymer film confined in - between two walls in the gradient direction and subjected to a steady shear flow .",
    "usually the distance between the interfaces in the other two directions is much larger and we ignore their influence .",
    "this model will predict the parallel orientation to be stable in the @xmath0 limit since the influence of shear and fluctuations vanishes in this limit .",
    "the only symmetry - breaking factor is then the wall - copolymer interaction which stabilizes the parallel orientation @xcite .",
    "the complex behaviour at lower shear rates will arise from the interplay of three factors : shear flow , fluctuations and wall - melt interactions .",
    "we admit that the influence of the surface interactions is possibly small . however , balsara _ et .",
    "al _ reported @xcite that in the absence of shear the walls of their shear cell induced the parallel alignment through the whole @xmath1-mm  sample , although the lamellar spacing is somewhat 4 orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "under shear laurer _ et .",
    "@xcite observed that independently of the bulk orientation there is always a near - surface layer of the parallel lamellae which penetrates up to @xmath2 m into the bulk .",
    "thus , even a weak symmetry - breaking field can be crucial in the absence of other factors .",
    "we also want to mention that the equilibrium theory of block - copolymer melt ordering near surfaces is well - developed @xcite .",
    "some questions about dynamics of such an ordering were addressed in @xcite . however , until now this theory was never applied to non - equilibrium systems .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive the equations governing the dynamics of the melt and construct a non - equilibrium potential whose minimal value will determine the stable orientation . in the first part of section iii we estimate the shear rate of the a - transition while the other two transitions ( b and c ) are analyzed in the second part . in conclusion",
    "we discuss in detail properties of the obtained phase diagram . in appendix",
    "we provide an example clarifying the role of thermal fluctuations .",
    "let us consider a block copolymer melt confined in - between two surfaces in the @xmath3-direction .",
    "it is also subjected to a steady shear flow @xmath4 ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "we ignore any alteration of this velocity profile and assume that it is kept through the whole system .",
    "we choose the local deviation of composition from its average to be an order parameter @xmath5 and define its fourier transform as @xmath6 where @xmath7 it is convenient to work in dimensionless units and we rescale lengths and wave - vectors : @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the size of a monomer .",
    "following @xcite we assume that the dynamics under shear flow is governed by the fokker - planck equation : @xmath11}{\\partial t}=\\int\\!\\!d{\\mathbf { r}}\\ , \\frac{\\delta } { \\delta \\phi({\\mathbf{r}})}\\left[\\mu\\left(\\frac{\\delta } { \\delta \\phi({\\mathbf{r}})}+\\frac{\\delta { \\mathcal h}}{\\delta \\phi({\\mathbf{r } } ) } \\right ) + d y \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right ] p[{\\mathbf { r}},t]\\ ] ] where @xmath12 $ ] is the probability to realize the order parameter profile @xmath5 at time @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is an onsager coefficient .",

    "our goal is to construct a real - space version of the leibler hamiltonian @xmath21 . in @xcite",

    "now we summarize our results in a phase diagram .",
    "in this work we incorporated some real - system properties into the previously developed theory of the orientational phase transitions under shear flow @xcite .",
    "in particular , we considered the influence of the shear - cell boundaries in the gradient direction on the orientation of the lamellar phase . in equilibrium",
    "the lamellae are known to orient parallel with respect to the boundaries @xcite . under shear",
    "the tendency to orient parallel to the surfaces competes with the orientation favoured by the flow which appears as a result of the coupling between the flow velocity field and the order - parameter fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the interplay between these two factors produces the non - trivial phase diagram shown in fig.[fig4 ] .    at low shear rates the parallel orientation is preferred by both the shear and surface terms in eq.([pot ] )",
    "therefore it is the only stable orientation in that part of the phase diagram .",
    "when shear rate reaches the value @xmath115 given by eq.([dcr ] ) , the perpendicular orientation becomes stable immediately below the odt temperature .",
    "we associate this change in orientation with the crossover from the fluctuation - dominated behaviour to the mean - field one .",
    "indeed , at very small shear rates the equilibrium fluctuation spectrum is only slightly modified by the flow , while at high shear rates the flow strongly suppresses fluctuations and restores the mean - field behaviour .",
    "therefore , there is a crossover point and the corresponding change of orientation .    at high shear rates and away from the spinodal ,",
    "the surface influence starts to play an important role . in the narrow region between @xmath115 and @xmath131 ,",
    "estimated from the condition in eq.([taus ] ) @xmath132 the influence of shear is still very strong and is capable of stabilizing the perpendicular orientation at all temperatures .",
    "the size of this region is very small due to the scaling @xmath133 .",
    "when @xmath134 there appears a region where the parallel orientation is stable .",
    "it takes over the perpendicular one at @xmath135 and looses its stability again at @xmath136 given by eq.([taus ] ) .",
    "this region grows as the shear rate increases , and in the limit @xmath137 the parallel orientation occupies the whole range of temperatures @xmath138 .",
    "this coincides with the predictions of the equilibrium mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "we therefore argue that there is no sharp c - transition as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "since the region between the spinodal and the parallel phase shrinks with an increase of the shear rate , there always be some value @xmath139 such that for @xmath140 the size of this region will be smaller than the resolution of the experimental device .",
    "this value @xmath139 can be misinterpreted as a position of an additional transition .",
    "an important feature of our theory is that it is able to reproduce the b - transition without additional assumptions . in the previous theory @xcite ,",
    "fredrickson had to take into account the difference in viscosities of the pure components in order to reproduce the b - transition .",
    "namely , he put @xmath141=\\eta_0+\\eta_1 \\phi$ ] which can be considered as a taylor expansion of the viscosity @xmath141 $ ] . as a result , in high - shear limit",
    "the size of the stability region for the perpendicular phase is of order of @xmath142 and grows as @xmath0 .",
    "while depicting the main physics , this approach has internal problems since the derivative @xmath143 is not a well - defined object and therefore the whole theory depends on a phenomenological parameter which is difficult to estimate .",
    "moreover , fredrickson s theory does not predict the c - transition .",
    "our theory is free from these problems .",
    "it , however , predicts the @xmath144 transition at very low temperatures in high - shear limit which was not observed .",
    "there could be several explanations of this prediction .",
    "first , this transition occurs at very low temperatures ( @xmath130 ) where the weak - segregation theory does not work .",
    "second , this transition might be an artifact of the @xmath145 expansion .",
    "finally , this transition can be removed if we use fredrickson s argument about the viscosity dependence on the order parameter .",
    "it stabilizes the parallel orientation at low temperatures .",
    "it is possible that the absolute value of the surface interaction is small .",
    "however , since it acts as a _ symmetry - breaking _ factor , its influence is very important @xcite .",
    "this statement can be checked experimentally .",
    "we have shown that the positions of the transition lines in the high - shear limit are dependent on the strength of the surface - copolymer interaction @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , the phase diagram of a particular copolymer system depends on the material of the shear - cell walls",
    ". a systematic study of this dependency will provide arguments for or against our theory .    in this work we have considered the influence of the walls in the gradient direction .",
    "we also want to comment on the role of the boundaries in the other shear directions ( flow and vorticity ) .",
    "formally , these walls will also induce alignment parallel to themselves .",
    "however , the flow profile near those walls is no longer a simple triangular one and we expect this disordered flow to destroy their orientational tendency .",
    "moreover , the distance between those surfaces is normally much larger than between the walls in the gradient direction and their influence is thus weaker .",
    "therefore we neglected them in our work .",
    "finally , we want to discuss briefly possible modifications and extensions of the developed theory .",
    "a very interesting problem is to calculate the alterations of the density profile in a confined system under shear .",
    "this can be achieved by restoring the position dependency in the amplitude @xmath51 and deriving the corresponding amplitude equation from eq.([c ] ) . in the absence of shear",
    "this problem was solved in @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to use our formalism for other external fields rather than interactions with surfaces .",
    "a good example is an electric field which is coupled to the square of the order parameter @xcite . with some modifications eq.([c],[s",
    "] ) can be a starting point for the corresponding theory .",
    "importance of such a theory for a system in electric field and simultaneously under shear was outlined in @xcite .",
    "the authors want to express their gratitude to eugenij polushkin for helpful discussions of the experimental details and berk hess for careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "here we want to emphasize the role of fluctuations in our theory . we are going to show that if the fokker - planck equation ( [ fp ] ) is replaced by a deterministic one , the theory will not be able to discriminate between different orientations .",
    "what follows should not be considered as a proof but , more likely , as an illustration that has general features .",
    "let us consider a langevin equation equivalent to the fokker - planck equation ( [ fp ] ) .",
    "if we now remove the noise term , it reads @xmath147 where an onsager mobility @xmath148 differs from @xmath14 in eq.([fp ] ) and @xmath21 is the leibler hamiltonian ( eq.([ham ] ) ) without @xmath149 and @xmath75 .",
    "a similar equation was considered in @xcite . there",
    "the authors used a hamiltonian with @xmath150 and showed that in steady - state the theory predicts both orientations to be equally stable at all shear rates .",
    "this is not surprising since their theory does not contain fluctuations and the angular dependence of the fourth - order vertex function @xmath65  the two ingredients that were argued to be crucial in explaining the reorientation phenomena @xcite .    in order to separate these two effects we keep the angular dependence in @xmath65 ( @xmath151 , @xmath152 ) , but use the deterministic equation ( [ lang ] ) .",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite and derive an amplitude equation from eq.([lang ] ) assuming a single plane - wave density profile .",
    "the solution of this equation is @xmath153^{-1/2}\\ ] ] and @xmath154 \\nonumber \\\\ \\sigma(t)=(1+\\epsilon ) q^2-q^4-\\frac{1}{4 } \\qquad , \\qquad q^2=q_x^2+(q_y - d t q_x)^2+q_z^2 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath155 is the amplitude , @xmath156 , and the amplitude and the units of length and time are scaled with @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively .",
    "we see that the equation becomes symmetric with respect to the interchange @xmath160 .",
    "thus , even in the presence of the angular dependence in @xmath65 it is impossible to distinguish between the parallel and perpendicular orientations starting from eq.([lang ] ) .",
    "we believe that a theory without fluctuations of the order parameter is not capable of describing the reorientational transitions .",
    "there are phenomena where fluctuations only modify a deterministic behaviour @xcite .",
    "however , the orientational behaviour under shear flow does not belong to this class of phenomena .",
    "it can only occur in the presence of thermal fluctuations .",
