    "localisation of a particle moving in a random environment may occur both quantum - mechanically and with classical dynamics , but the phenomenon is very different in the two cases . in this paper",
    "we discuss a class of quantum - mechanical localisation problems for which some physical quantities can be expressed exactly in terms of averages taken in a classical counterpart .",
    "the equivalence holds despite the fact that interference effects dominate the behaviour of the quantum systems .",
    "disordered quantum systems can in general be classified according to their symmetries under time reversal and spin rotation .",
    "three such symmetry classes are represented by the wigner - dyson random matrix ensembles , while an additional seven have been identified more recently .",
    "the models we study here belong to one of these additional classes , termed class c by altland and zirnbauer.@xcite one feature which distinguishes systems belonging to each of the additional symmetry classes from those in the wigner - dyson classes is that they have a special energy in their spectrum , with eigenstates occurring in pairs either side of this energy .",
    "some of the additional classes have realisations as bogoliubov  de gennes hamiltonians for quasiparticles in disordered superconductors , where pairing interactions are treated at the mean - field level . here , the special energy is the chemical potential in the superconductor and eigenstates are related in pairs by a particle - hole transformation . in particular , class c arises for quasiparticles in a spin - singlet superconductor in which time - reversal symmetry is broken for orbital motion but zeeman splitting is negligible.@xcite since quasiparticle charge is not conserved in a superconductor , experiments to investigate quasiparticle dynamics in these systems must probe thermal or spin transport .",
    "moreover , as the characteristic features of the symmetry class appear only close to the chemical potential , it is particularly gapless superconductors that are interesting : cuprate superconductors in the mixed state constitute a conspicuous example .",
    "the models we study are especially simple realisations of their symmetry class .",
    "they are obtained as generalisations of the network model originally introduced to describe localisation in the context of the integer quantum hall plateau transition.@xcite thus , they are formulated in the language of scattering theory and represent quantum particles , in general with @xmath0-component wavefunctions , propagating on the directed links , or edges , of a lattice and scattering between links at nodes .",
    "the symmetry of class c restricts @xmath0 to even values , while our approach requires that all nodes of the lattice have two ingoing and two outcoming links . for these models , we are concerned with the density of states , obtained from the time - evolution operator , and with the disorder - averaged conductance of a finite sample , calculated from the landauer formula . in both cases ,",
    "our starting point is an expansion for the green function as a sum over feynman paths .",
    "our central result is that the terms in this sum which survive after disorder - averaging can be interpreted as self - avoiding classical random walks with attractive , short - range interactions .",
    "a particular network model from class c , in two dimensions and with @xmath1 , has been studied previously.@xcite it shows the so - called spin quantum hall effect , having two insulating phases , with quantised values of hall conductance differing by an integer , separated in the phase diagram by a delocalisation transition which is analogous to the quantum hall plateau transition . in a remarkable paper , using supersymmetry to perform disorder averages , gruzberg , read and ludwig@xcite ( grl ) have shown that many physical quantities of interest in this model can be determined from the properties of the perimeters , or hulls , of classical percolation clusters in two dimensions .",
    "the approach we describe here provides an alternative derivation of their results , using more elementary , non - supersymmetric methods , as well as an extension to other lattices , including ones in more than two dimensions and irregular lattices for which transfer matrix methods are inappropriate .",
    "it also extends to any even integer @xmath0 .",
    "our expressions give disorder - averaged physical quantities for the quantum system in terms of averages over classical random walks on the same lattice . in the case treated by grl",
    "these walks are simply percolation hulls , for which many analytical results are available .",
    "by contrast , in the general case the properties of the classical walks are not known .",
    "nevertheless , the classical problem is much simpler than the original quantum problem , and we are able to construct further examples for which it is tractable .",
    "we remark that a different type of connection between quantum hall plateau transitions and percolation , based on the classical limit , has been discussed recently in refs .   and .",
    "there are some important qualitative differences between the properties of systems from wigner - dyson classes and those from the additional symmetry classes .",
    "in particular , while single - particle quantities such as the density of states are smooth functions of energy in the former case , in the latter case they may have singularities at the special energy , which we take to be zero in the following .",
    "this is illustrated by previous results on behaviour of models from class c , obtained using a variety of techniques.@xcite random matrix ensembles with this symmetry , representing the zero - dimensional limit appropriate for quantum dots , have a density of states that vanishes quadratically in energy at energies much smaller than the mean level spacing .",
    "@xcite similar behaviour is expected for finite - dimensional systems if states are anderson localised , on the grounds that random matrix theory should describe states within a localisation volume .",
    "@xcite calculations for one - dimensional systems from class c , using either supersymmetry @xcite or the dmpk equation , @xcite confirm this idea .    existing information on localisation in class c systems",
    "is also provided in part by renormalisation group treatments @xcite of the appropriate non - linear sigma model at weak coupling , corresponding to weak disorder .",
    "these calculations identify two as the lower critical dimension .",
    "thus , as in the wigner - dyson symmetry classes , it is only in more than two dimensions that a transition occurs between localised and metallic phases as a function of disorder strength , while in one dimension even weak disorder is sufficient to localise all states .",
    "in addition , for two - dimensional systems with broken time - reversal symmetry , including both ones from the wigner - dyson unitary class and ones from class c , a delocalisation transition of the quantum hall type is possible , and it is this transition that has been the focus of past work on class c network models .",
    "@xcite    many of these aspects , including the form of the density of states in a localised phase and the possibility of a quantum hall plateau transition , emerge naturally from the approach we describe here , which is presented as follows . in sec.[models ] we introduce in detail the models that we are concerned with . in sec.[results ]",
    "we set out our general results , relating the density of states and average conductance for a network model to averages over certain classical random walks , and present proofs of these results .",
    "we describe applications of these general results to the spin quantum hall effect , to random matrix theory , and to localisation on a cayley tree , in sec.[applications ] .",
    "open questions and future prospects are discussed in sec.[discussion ] .",
    "we shall be concerned with models both for closed systems and ( in connection with the landauer formula for conductance ) for open systems , but we restrict definitions initially to closed systems . consider a graph @xmath2 consisting of directed edges @xmath3 connecting nodes @xmath4 , each of degree four , with the restriction that at each node two directed edges enter and two leave .",
    "an @xmath0-component wavefunction propagates on each edge .",
    "this propagation may be described by a unitary evolution operator @xmath5 , which evolves the wave function one unit forwards in time , as the particle moves from a given edge to a neighbouring one .",
    "the evolution operator plays the same role in defining the network model as does the hamiltonian in the case , for example , of a tight - binding model .",
    "it has been discussed for the @xmath6 network model in refs . and .",
    "in general , it is constructed from two ingredients .",
    "first , with each edge @xmath3 is associated a unitary @xmath7 matrix @xmath8 .",
    "this matrix specifies the ( generalised ) phase acquired on traversing the link .",
    "second , with each node @xmath4 is associated an @xmath9-matrix of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the @xmath7 unit matrix .",
    "this @xmath9-matrix describes scattering at the node from the incoming edges to the outgoing ones .",
    "if @xmath2 has @xmath12 edges ( and therefore @xmath13 nodes ) , then @xmath5 is an @xmath14 matrix , with @xmath15 .",
    "it consists of @xmath13 blocks , each associated with a particular node and of size @xmath16 .",
    "the block at the node @xmath4 has the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 label the edges which are respectively incoming and outgoing at this node .",
    "so far , the symmetry class of the network model has not been fixed , except that propagation along directed links breaks time - reversal symmetry . to identify network models from class c , one starts@xcite from the defining property of a hamiltonian @xmath20 with this symmetry , which is @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the conventional pauli matrix acting on spin variables and @xmath23 is the complex conjugate of @xmath20 .",
    "applying this to @xmath5 , interpreted as @xmath24 , the number of wavefunction components @xmath0 must be even , so that the space of states on each link may be viewed as consisting of @xmath25 two - component subspaces , within which @xmath22 operates . then eq.([class - c ] ) becomes @xmath26 and from this an equivalent restriction follows on the edge phases , @xmath27 , which are therefore unitary sp(@xmath0 ) matrices , equivalent for @xmath1 to su(2 ) matrices .",
    "randomness is introduced into these models via the edge phases .",
    "we take them to be independent random variables drawn from a distribution which is uniform on the invariant ( haar ) measure of sp(@xmath0 ) .",
    "the quenched average of a given quantity in the network model , denoted by @xmath28 , is the mean with respect to this measure .",
    "an open system is constructed from a closed system of this type by ` cutting open ' a number of edges .",
    "the two halves of each edge cut into two in this way constitute one new edge directed into the system and one new edge directed out of the system .",
    "we may consider a conductance experiment between two ` contacts ' by grouping a subset of these of the incoming edges @xmath29 to form one contact and another subset of the outgoing edges @xmath30 to form the other .",
    "the transmission matrix @xmath31 between these two contacts is a rectangular matrix whose elements are @xmath32 .",
    "the spin conductance measured between the two contacts in units of @xmath33 is @xmath34 from the multi - channel landauer formula .",
    "clearly , a great variety of specific models can be constructed within this framework , by making different choices for the graph @xmath2 and for the number of channels @xmath0 .",
    "we defer discussion of particular examples to sec.[applications ] .",
    "in this section we state and prove our results for a general graph @xmath2 .",
    "we consider first the particular case of @xmath1 , and discuss the extension to general @xmath0 in sec.[general - n ] .      the green function for propagation from edge @xmath35 to edge @xmath3 is ( with @xmath1 ) a @xmath36 matrix @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a state in the two - component space of wavefunctions for a particle located on the edge @xmath3 . for @xmath39 eq.([gee ] ) may be expanded as a sum over feynman paths on @xmath2 which begin on @xmath35 and end on @xmath3 : each path gives an ordered product of factors @xmath40 along edges traversed by the path , weighted by appropriate factors of @xmath41 and @xmath42 for each node through which it passes .",
    "alternatively , we may re - write eq.([gee ] ) as @xmath43 obtaining instead a series convergent for @xmath44 , involving an ordered product of factors @xmath45 and an overall negative sign for each feynman path .",

    "the average green function is given for @xmath39 by the generating function for the probability @xmath52 in the classical problem that the edge @xmath3 belongs to a loop of a given length @xmath53 .",
    "explicitly @xmath54 for @xmath44 it is given instead by @xmath55      the eigenvalues of the evolution operator @xmath5 for a closed graph lie on the unit circle in the complex plane and may be written as @xmath56 , with eigenphases @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",

    "may also be considered for an open system . for an open system with @xmath64 cut links , each decomposition breaks @xmath2 into @xmath64 directed paths which each run from an ingoing edge to an outgoing one , together with a number ( possibly zero ) of closed loops .",

    "it is useful to introduce for a closed system the resolvent @xmath69 ( where tr again indicates an sp(2 ) trace ) and to generalise this to the case where the parameter @xmath70 takes independent values @xmath71 on each edge @xmath3 .",

    "this can be shown using the representation @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is a unit real 3-vector and the @xmath83s are the pauli matrices , so that @xmath84 the result now follows from the observation that the invariant measure for sp@xmath73 is the uniform measure on the group manifold s@xmath85 , and therefore has the form @xmath86 .",
    "* lemma 2 . * if @xmath87 is a real linear combination of sp@xmath73 matrices , it is itself proportional to an sp@xmath73 matrix , with a real scalar constant of proportionality",
    ". this follows directly from the above representation for each matrix .",
    "the main argument in the proof of theorem 1 now proceeds as follows . as discussed above , for each realisation of the randomness , @xmath72 is a sum over closed directed paths on @xmath2 . for a particular path ,",
    "each link or node may be traversed an arbitrary number of times .",
    "we first show that it is sufficient , in calculating the mean @xmath88 , to restrict this sum to those paths which traverse each edge exactly twice or not at all .",
    "let us consider the sum of all paths in which a particular edge @xmath3 is traversed exactly @xmath75 times .",

    "since @xmath88 is a multinomial expression in the parameters @xmath98 , the argument may be applied to each edge in turn to show that the only allowed powers of any @xmath71 entering this expression are 0 or 2 .",
    "this establishes the first part of the proof . _ _    for paths in which each node is visited only 0 or 2 times ,",
    "the main result follows immediately .",
    "for such a path must traverse a closed loop in the decomposition of @xmath2 exactly twice . at each node",
    "there will be factors of @xmath99 or @xmath100 , giving precisely the correct weighting for this loop to appear in the decomposition .",
    "the product of sp@xmath73 matrices along the loop will have the form @xmath101 thus , defining @xmath102 , this is equivalent to averaging @xmath103 , which gives @xmath104 by lemma 1 .",
    "finally , the trace gives a factor of 2 .",
    "further effort is required to treat paths which visit some nodes more than twice .",
    "a little thought shows that such a node must be visited exactly four times , entering and leaving exactly twice along each directed edge , if the contribution to @xmath105 is not to vanish on averaging .",
    "consider such a node @xmath4 , and label the incoming and outgoing edges as @xmath18 , @xmath19 respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ decomp ] ) .",
    "we show that the sum over all paths visiting this node four times may be written in terms of the two ways of decomposing this node , with precisely the correct weights .",
    "let @xmath106 be the sum over all paths from edge @xmath107 to edge @xmath108 , which do not use any of these four edges .",
    "the sum over paths visiting the node four times may be decomposed into eighteen different contributions , depending on the order in which the edges are visited .",
    "each contains a product of four factors @xmath106 as well as sp@xmath73 matrices @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "there are in fact two types of contribution : in the first type , two of the @xmath106 appear twice and the others not at all ; while in the second type all four @xmath106 appear once each .",
    "there are six of the first type and they have the form    @xmath111    and @xmath112    where we have introduced the shorthand @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "( note that ( [ mes2 ] ) and ( [ mes3 ] ) give separate contributions to @xmath72 ; similarly for ( [ mes5 ] ) and ( [ mes6 ] ) ) .",

    "each of ( [ mes2 ] ) and ( [ mes3 ] ) are equal to the average of @xmath118 ( that is , @xmath119 ) , multiplied by @xmath120 .",

    "six of these are    @xmath127    in addition , there are six equal contributions in which the factors are cyclically permuted so that each begins @xmath128 .",
    "each term is proportional to @xmath129 .",
    "the remainder of the expressions may be simplified , for example , by redefining @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",

    ", we find that ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) give factors of @xmath135 , while ( [ c ] ) - ( [ f ] ) give @xmath136 .",
    "the sum of all twelve such contributions is therefore @xmath137 the important feature of this result is that it is _ independent _ of @xmath138 .",

    "[ decomp ] ) . for in the first case , @xmath47 , we find @xmath144 , while in the second case of @xmath48 , we get @xmath145 . _ _",
    "now we may simply go through @xmath2 , decomposing it node by node .",
    "the result is that @xmath88 is given by the weighted sum over the same quantity calculated on graphs arising from all possible decompositions of @xmath2 ; such graphs consist of closed loops with no remaining nodes . in each decomposition",
    ", a given edge @xmath3 belongs to just one loop , and , for that loop , of length @xmath53 say , the contribution to @xmath146 is just @xmath147 .",
    "thus the mean @xmath148 is given by the average of this quantity over the ensemble of loops corresponding to the decomposition of @xmath2 .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem 1 .",
    "so far we have considered unitary evolution on a closed system . however , since the proof is constructed to work for arbitrary values of the parameters @xmath149 , it generalises straightforwardly to an open system where probability is not conserved at the nodes which are connected to external leads .",
    "for example , if in fig .",
    "[ decomp ] , the edges @xmath150 correspond to external leads which carry no current , then we should consider only those feynman paths through @xmath4 which pass directly from @xmath151 , with amplitude @xmath41 . in the above argument ,",
    "this may be taken into account by regarding this node as a single edge , carrying an sp@xmath73 matrix @xmath152 , and with fugacity @xmath153 . with this modification ,",
    "the proof of theorem 1 goes through as before .",
    "now consider conductance measurements on a open graph @xmath154 , with external contacts @xmath29 and @xmath30 , as described in sec .",
    "[ models ] .",
    "consider the graph @xmath155 formed from @xmath154 by joining particular outgoing and incoming external edges @xmath156 and @xmath157 to create a new internal edge @xmath3 .",
    "observe that , in calculating @xmath158 , the edge @xmath3 is always traversed exactly twice .",
    "therefore @xmath159 since @xmath160 is given by a sum over sp@xmath73 matrices , by lemmas 1 and 2 , @xmath161 .",
    "now apply theorem 1 : it follows that @xmath162 is twice the probability that @xmath157 and @xmath156 are connected by a path in the decomposition of @xmath2 .",
    "summing over all the edges @xmath157 and @xmath156 as required by the landauer formula ( [ conductance ] ) then gives the result stated in theorem 2 .",
    "our approach to the sp(@xmath0 ) model with even @xmath163 is based on the fact that a general sp(@xmath0 ) rotation can be written as a product of rotations derived from a limited number of generators .",
    "moreover , under rather weak conditions , the probability distribution of such a product containing random factors will converge as the number of factors increases to the haar measure on sp(@xmath0 ) : the requirement is simply that no subspace is left invariant by the ensemble of rotations .",
    "we therefore build the sp(@xmath0 ) model on @xmath2 by taking @xmath25 copies of the sp(2 ) model , each individually defined on @xmath2 , and coupling the copies together .",
    "this coupling takes the form of a product of many non - commuting matrices .",
    "successive factors in the product are of two kinds .",
    "one kind is block - diagonal with @xmath25 random sp(2 ) blocks , resulting in intra - copy scattering ; the other kind must produce inter - copy scattering and may be chosen non - random .",
    "it is convenient to restrict the inter - copy scattering to be between corresponding links in each copy .",
    "for example , in the case of sp(4 ) each pair of corresponding links is coupled as shown in fig .",
    "the evolution matrix for this pair of links consists of a product @xmath9 of a large number of factors , each of the form @xmath164 where @xmath165 and @xmath166 are random sp(2 ) matrices , chosen independently for each term in the matrix product .",
    "-matrix which mixes the two channels . after averaging ,",
    "this is equivalent to the decomposition shown on the right hand side , equally weighted.,width=302 ]    the advantage of this choice is that we may immediately apply our main theorem to show that , after averaging over the random sp(2 ) matrices , the mean density of states and mean conductance are given in terms of a decomposition of each node as before , and a decomposition of each link as shown in fig.[sp4 ] , with equal probabilities for each term .",
    "this construction may be generalised to sp(@xmath0 ) for arbitrary even @xmath0 : the result is that , in the classical system , the @xmath25 exit trajectories are a random permutation of the incident ones , with all permutations having equal weight , independently for each edge .",
    "there are three obvious classes of behaviour possible in the classical scattering problem which we have arrived at , corresponding to loops , or closed classical walks , that are localised , extended or critical .    by _",
    "localised _ classical walks , we mean that only a vanishing fraction of walks have infinite length , and that the number of walks longer than a characteristic size @xmath167 decreases rapidly with @xmath167 .",
    "one might have , for example , @xmath168 for @xmath169 .",

    "closed loops of the classical problem form interior or exterior hulls of bond percolation clusters on the larger lattice .",
    "it is known that such loops are finite with characteristic size @xmath167 except at the critical point , @xmath202 , which for bond percolation on the square lattice occurs at @xmath203 .",
    "on approaching the critical point , @xmath167 diverges as @xmath204 with @xmath205 , while at the critical point the distribution of hull lengths is @xmath193 at large @xmath53 , with @xmath206 . in this way",
    "one finds that the quantum localisation length diverges with the same exponent value , @xmath205 , as the plateau transition is approached , and that the density of states @xmath176 varies for small @xmath180 as @xmath207 in the localised phase , and as @xmath208 at the critical point .",
    "the simplest application of our discussion of sp(@xmath0 ) models with general @xmath0 is to random matrix theory . to this end",
    ", we take @xmath2 to consist of a single edge closed on itself . then the evolution operator @xmath5 is a random sp(@xmath0 ) matrix , chosen with the haar measure . in this case the density of states @xmath176 is the eigenphase density for the sp(@xmath0 ) random matrix ensemble , which has been determined previously by zirnbauer@xcite using supersymmetry methods .    applying to this problem the approach we have described in sec .",
    "[ general - n ] , we must consider @xmath25 copies of an edge , which are closed by connecting outgoing ends to a permutation of ingoing ends .",
    "for example , the case @xmath209 corresponds to joining opposite ends of the two possibilities shown in fig .",
    "[ sp4 ] , thus producing with equal probability either two loops , each of length 1 , or a single loop of length 2 . for general @xmath0 , all possible lengths @xmath53 up to @xmath25 are possible , with equal probability .",

    "an example with coordination number @xmath214 and four generations is shown ; system size is increased by increasing the number of generations .",

    "we restrict attention to @xmath1 and consider first coordination number @xmath214 . as previously",
    ", we define @xmath52 to be the probability that the edge @xmath3 of the root , far from the surface of the tree , lies on a given closed loop of length @xmath53 .",
    "+ then @xmath218 this can be solved by using the generating function @xmath219 : we obtain @xmath220 + we take the branch of @xmath221 such that @xmath222 ; thus @xmath223 when @xmath224 , @xmath225 is equal to @xmath226 for @xmath227 and @xmath228 for @xmath229 .",
    "therefore for @xmath229 , @xmath230 , so that all walks are localised .",
    "the characteristic loop size is given by @xmath231 + however , when @xmath227 , @xmath232 ^ 2 < 1\\,.$ ] thus in this case a proportion @xmath233 of the walks do not close ; they are extended . for such walks , ( [ eb ] ) is invalid since it describes only closed walks of a finite length .",
    "for @xmath234 and large @xmath235 , we find the critical behaviour : @xmath236 the corresponding density of states in the quantum system ( defined locally on an edge far from the surface , to avoid surface effects ) has the behaviour @xmath237    we can extend this analysis to consider coordination number @xmath238 ; then @xmath239^{q-1}\\,.\\ ] ] thus @xmath240^{q-2}$ ] locates the unique branch point of @xmath221 .",
    "the complex roots of the two branches of @xmath221 corresponding to @xmath230 ( all paths of finite length ) and @xmath241 ( where @xmath242 is the fraction of paths which are infinite ) , coincide at @xmath243 .",
    "we conclude that for @xmath244 all walks are localised , whereas for @xmath245 there exists a fraction @xmath242 of extended walks . in addition",
    ", we find that the critical behaviour @xmath246 holds for all @xmath247 . in the localised phase , the typical loop length is given by @xmath248 thus , with critical value @xmath203 replaced by @xmath249 , the behaviour of the density of states is the same as in the @xmath214 case .",
    "the critical exponents are therefore universal and independent of @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , we note that there is a one - to - one correspondence between walks on the cayley cactus and percolation clusters on the cayley tree ; therefore the critical exponents are related to those of percolation .",
    "in this section we outline directions for future work .",
    "these are of two kinds .",
    "first , one can imagine a variety of models which are likely to exhibit phenomena not shown in the examples treated in sec .",
    "[ applications ] .",
    "second , one can hope to make use of connections between the classical random walks that arise in our approach and statistical problems studied previously .",
    "further work on both these aspects is in progress.@xcite in general , the equivalent classical problems correspond to self - attractive random walks of various kinds .",
    "they are attractive because the weight for passing through a given node twice is @xmath198 , rather than @xmath250 .",
    "however , the actual behaviour is expected to depend very much on the individual lattice .",
    "many of these problems correspond to the classical scattering of light by random arrays of mirrors : for example , in each decomposition of fig .",
    "[ decomp ] , a two - sided mirror can be placed so that the classical trajectory reflects off it .",
    "such problems have been studied extensively@xcite .",
    "they may also be realised in terms of _ history - dependent _ kinetic random walks , in the sense that the walker may be thought of as placing a mirror at random the first time it reaches a node : if it revisits the node , however , the mirror is already in place .",
    "this puts such models in the class of so - called ` true ' self - avoiding walks , which have been studied using field - theoretic rg methods in the limit of weak scattering@xcite .",
    "interestingly , such studies indicate a critical dimension of two , just as for anderson localisation . _ _    a two - dimensional model with behaviour which we expect to contrast with that found in the spin quantum hall effect can be obtained by taking @xmath2 to be the manhattan lattice , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ manhatten ] , in place of the l - lattice .",
    "the crucial distinction is that , for the network model on the l - lattice , two distinct phases can be identified from the different nature of edge states in the limits @xmath251 and @xmath252 , while for the manhattan lattice there are no edge states in either limit .",
    "equivalently , the hall conductance of the model on the l - lattice may be non - zero , being determined on short distances by the value of @xmath198 , but quantised at large distances , while on the manhattan lattice the hall conductance always has average value zero .",
    "consequently , one expects from the scaling flow diagram for quantum hall systems@xcite and the renormalisation group calculations for the class c non - linear sigma model at weak coupling@xcite that states of the manhattan model should be localised for all @xmath253 . since classical trajectories on the manhattan lattice cross at nodes with probability @xmath198",
    ", they are not the hulls of percolation clusters . nevertheless , it is straightforward to use bond percolation on a lattice which has a lattice spacing larger by a factor @xmath201 and is rotated by @xmath254 relative to the manhattan lattice to set an upper bound on loop sizes : this is sufficient to prove localisation for @xmath229 , and for @xmath255 classical loops are simply the elementary plaquettes of @xmath2 .",
    "conversely , at @xmath256 classical trajectories are simply straight lines , and so one expects the localisation length to diverge as @xmath251 .",
    "-matrix elements of @xmath215 and @xmath257 are associated respectively with @xmath258 turns at nodes and with propagation in a straight line.,width=264 ]    a second variant on the spin quantum hall effect can be constructed by considering the sp(@xmath0 ) model on the l - lattice , but with @xmath163 .",
    "it is natural to anticipate from the scaling flow diagram proposed for quantum hall systems@xcite that this model should have @xmath25 delocalisation transitions as the node parameter @xmath198 increases from @xmath256 to @xmath255 . between transitions ,",
    "states are localised and the hall conductance is quantised . as a transition",
    "is approached , the localisation length diverges , and on passing through a transition , the number of edge states and the quantised value of the hall conductance both change by two .",
    "it remains a challenge to understand how or whether such behaviour arises in the language of classical walks , and might be interesting to relate the large-@xmath0 limit of the lattice problem to the field theory discussed in ref .",
    "a third direction is to consider models defined on graphs in three or more dimensions . a three - dimensional version of the u(1 )",
    "network model has been studied previously using a layered system@xcite and models with cubic symmetry may also be constructed . for systems in three and higher dimensions one expects that both localised and metallic phases should be possible , each existing over a range of values for node parameter , @xmath198 , with a transition between the two at a critical value @xmath202 . since in two dimensions it is known that the theta - point transition between collapsed and swollen phases of a self - attracting polymer chain has the same exponents as those of percolation hulls@xcite , it is tempting to suggest that in higher dimensions this delocalisation transition might also be in the theta - point universality class .",
    "if so , we would expect mean - field behaviour , with logarithmic corrections for @xmath259 .",
