    "acceleration of particles is one of the key issues in the study of solar flares @xcite .",
    "although it is well established that charged particles need to be accelerated via electro - magnetic interactions and energetic neutrals are produced by energetic charged particles via secondary processes @xcite , the exact nature of particle acceleration is still a matter of debate .",
    "given the complexity of the magnetic field structure in the solar atmosphere , where most of the particles are presumably accelerated , current observations suggest that the exact process of particle acceleration may be coupled with the evolution of the magnetic field so that a variety of particle acceleration processes operate in flares and different processes play the dominant role in different stages and/or parts of solar flares @xcite .",
    "for example , for the classical large two - ribbon flares , energetic charged particles may be accelerated by large scale electric fields in the reconnecting current sheet @xcite , by a newly formed collapsing loop via the betatron process , by alfvn waves within the loop @xcite , by shocks induced by the reconnection outflows , and by turbulent plasma waves generic to the energy dissipation process @xcite .",
    "comprehensive observational coverage is therefore necessary to understand the processes of particle acceleration in detail , especially for large flares with complex structures .",
    "observational study of particle acceleration may be simplified dramatically by focusing on flares with a simple geometrical structure , implying a relatively simple magnetic field , in particular for individual flare loops .",
    "based on _ rhessi _ observations of dense flare loops , recently showed that the length of the acceleration region in these events is about half the length of the flare loops and the rate of acceleration defined as particles per second can be very high @xcite .",
    "such flares may be triggered by the internal kink instability of a magnetic loop , and comprehensive observations and analysis of these flares play an important role in quantitative modeling of flares and detailed studies of the related physical processes .    in a recent paper @xcite , we showed that a _ goes _ class b flare loop produced super - hot plasmas with an impulsive temperature evolution with little evidence of particle acceleration @xcite . in the context of stochastic acceleration of particles by plasma waves from the thermal background plasma @xcite , @xcite proposed a simple one - zone model , where the spatially integrated particle distribution is modeled with the detailed structure of the acceleration region ignored , for the so - called elementary energy release event to account for the frequently observed soft - hard - soft spectral evolution of hxr bursts .",
    "the model may be applied to simple flare loops as well .",
    "@xcite showed that the acceleration of particles is very sensitive to the intensity of the turbulent plasma waves so that a purely thermal x - ray flare may suggest that the turbulent intensity is not strong enough to produce sufficient energetic electrons to be detected by _",
    "rhessi_. nevertheless the complex source structure along the loop in the flare analyzed by @xcite does indicate that this simple model may not capture the physical process responsible for the impulsive temperature evolution , and that spatial structure needs to be considered in detailed modeling of specific flares @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze x - ray observations with _ goes _ and _ rhessi _ , and radio observations with nobeyama radio polarimeters ( norp ) , of a _ goes _ class c1.4 flare loop with clear hard x - ray ( hxr ) emission above 50 kev implying efficient electron acceleration .",
    "the flare occurred on 12th august 2002 and has been studied previously by @xcite , who focused on the chromospheric evaporation process .",
    "we focus on the energetics , the characteristics of emissions produced by nonthermal electrons and the relation between the thermal and the nonthermal component to explore the overall energy release process .",
    "our observational results are given in section [ observation ] . in section [ dis ]",
    ", we discuss the implications of these results on the energy release and electron acceleration processes .",

    "the flare occurred on 12th august 2002 and had a preflare _ goes _ background fluxes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 w m@xmath2 in the 1 - 8   ( 1.5 - 12 kev ) and 0.5 - 4   ( 3 - 24 kev ) channel , respectively .",
    "the _ goes _ high energy channel flux started to increase at 02:16:30 ut while the low energy channel flux started to increase about half a minute later at 02:17:00 ut ( first panel of fig .",
    "@xcite argued that the background fluxes subtracted from the _ goes _ fluxes for spectral analysis should be chosen to guarantee a smooth increase of the derived temperature and emission measure ( @xmath3 ) in the early rise phase .",

    "[ f1 ] ) and @xmath3 ( 4th panel of fig [ f1 ] . ) using the standard idl goes analysis software . due to the high preflare background ,",
    "results before 02:17:00 ut are questionable .",
    "the _ rhessi _ count rates in the 6 - 12 kev and 12 - 25 kev band start to increase before 02:16:30ut ( second panel of fig .",
    "whenever acceptable , we use an isothermal model in the ospex software to fit the _ rhessi _ photon spectra above 6 kev for every 4 second interval obtained with the front segment of detectors 1 , 3 , and 6 @xcite .",
    "a broken power - law component is added to the fitting model when the reduced @xmath6 of the isothermal model exceeds 3 . for this broken power - law component ,",
    "the photon spectral index below the break energy is fixed at 1.5 with @xmath7 : the normalization at a pivot energy of 10 kev , @xmath8 : the break energy , and @xmath9 : the power - law index above the break energy as free parameters .",

    "panels 5 to 7 also show the radio flux measurement at 9.4 , 17 , and 35 ghz , spectral indices derived from the relevant flux ratios , and polarization fraction , respectively .",
    "the radio polarization fraction and the good correlation between the radio fluxes and @xmath7 show clearly that the radio emission is produced by energetic electrons via the gyrosynchrotron process .",
    "the gyrosynchrotron radio emission is mostly produced by electrons well above 50 kev , which may explain the coincidence of peak times of the @xmath10 kev and radio fluxes .",
    "the delay of these peaks with respect to the hxr peak at lower energies may be attributed to more efficient trapping of higher energy electrons in the coronal loop @xcite , which may also explain the fact that the 9.4 and 17 ghz fluxes decay more gradually than @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the high energy tail of the thermal component may contribute significantly to the low frequency radio emission via the gyrosynchrotron process in the decay phase , which is consistent with the faster decay of 35 ghz flux than those of the other two low frequency channels .",
    "more detailed modeling is needed to clarify this issue @xcite .",

    ". however emission below 10 kev is always dominated by the isothermal component , similar to a flare studied by @xcite .",

    "the upper panels of figure [ f3 ] show the radio image contours over - plotted with x - ray contours in the acceleration phase .",
    "the x - ray emission clearly outlines a loop structure .",
    "most of the radio emission comes from the northern leg of the loop , which is also the location of the weaker footpoint hxr emission . both of these are consistent with a stronger magnetic field at this footpoint that inhibits electron precipitation in the ` trap - plus - precipitation ' scenario @xcite .",
    "the lower panels show the _ rhessi _ image contours in different energy bands over - plotted on an image of the post impulsive phase loop obtained with the eit at 195   at 02:23:59 ut . the appearance of footpoints at high energies ( @xmath11 kev ) in the acceleration phase does not affect the structure of the thermal coronal source significantly and the _ rhessi _ and _ goes _ thermal components appear to occupy the same volume as outlined by the contours in the 5 - 7 kev and 8 - 12 kev bands .",
    "there were no accompanying cmes and type ii radio bursts as seen in eruptive events and no type iii radio bursts , in agreement with the simple magnetic topology of a closed loop .",
    "in this section , we explore the energetics and electron acceleration process in this flare loop based on the observational results presented above . to measure the relevant physical quantities , we adopt the flare loop model explored numerically by @xcite , where the loop is separated into three distinct regions : the loop top acceleration site , the legs of the loop where the transport processes dominate , and the dense chromospheric footpoints .",
    "panels 3 and 4 of figure [ f1 ] show that the @xmath3 of the _ rhessi _ thermal component is at least one order of magnitude lower than that of the _ goes _ and the temperature of the _ rhessi _ thermal component is at least 70% higher than the _ goes _ temperature . given the gradual evolution of these parameters and the relatively stable structure of the soft x - ray source , one may associate the _ rhessi _ and _ goes _ thermal components with the loop top acceleration site and the legs of the loop , respectively and assume that the _ rhessi _ and _ goes _ thermal components are in pressure equilibrium @xcite .",

    "first , the appearance of the nonthermal component is associated with a suppression of the energy change rate of the _ rhessi _ thermal component ( see blue and red data points in the top panel of figure [ f4 ] ) .",
    "this supports the stochastic particle acceleration model where nonthermal particles are accelerated from the high - energy tail of the thermal background .",
    "the acceleration may lead to an effective cooling of the background plasma as suggested by the _",
    "rhessi _ temperature evolution in figure [ f1 ] due to efficient transport of high - energy electrons along the loop as revealed by the hxr footpoints .",
    "the decrease of the _ rhessi _ temperature after the onset of electron acceleration is not an artifact of our spectral fitting model . by fitting the spectrum in the 6 to 15 kev energy range with an isothermal model ,",
    "we obtain almost identical _ rhessi _ temperature and @xmath3 .",
    "the appearance of radio emission produced by energetic electrons via the gyro - synchrotron process after the onset of electron acceleration also supports our spectral model ( see discussion in the following subsection ) .",
    "the _ goes _ temperature increases monotonically in the rise phase and is not affected significantly by the onset of electron acceleration , which implies that the acceleration only proceeds in the relatively hotter _ rhessi _ thermal component .",
    "the relatively cooler _ goes _ thermal component likely originates from the evaporated chromosphere plasma and does not participate in the acceleration process directly .",
    "second , at the peak of @xmath7 , the energy deposition rate by energetic electrons is comparable to the energy change rate of the _ goes _ thermal component .",
    "however , the evolution of the _ goes _ component is not well correlated with the nonthermal component .",
    "given the short thermalization timescale at the chromosphere , this deposited energy must be radiated away at lower energy channels or drive evaporation of relatively cold plasmas @xcite .",
    "the total radiative energy of the _ goes _ thermal component is about @xmath28 erg , which is a factor of a few lower than the energy content of the thermal component as shown in the middle panel of figure [ f4 ] implying efficient emission at lower energy channels .",
    "observations in the optical to euv band will be able to distinguish these two scenarios @xcite .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ f4 ] also shows that the total energy deposited by energetic electrons at the footpoints is also less than the energy content of the _ goes _ thermal component , which is consistent with the lack of good correlation between the nonthermal energy deposition rate and the energy increase rate of the _ goes _ thermal component .",
    "these results do not support the theoretical neupert effect which requires that the thermalization of the electron beam producing the observed hxr dominates the energy increase of the _ goes _ thermal component @xcite .",
    "last , the bottom panel of figure [ f4 ] shows that the acceleration region of the _ rhessi _ thermal component is expanding rapidly in the preheating phase presumably caused by the continuous heating .",
    "although uncertainties in the _ goes _ parameters in this phase render the quantitative detail questionable , the rapid increase of energy content of the _ rhessi _ thermal component is evident .",
    "the expansion pauses at the onset of the electron acceleration possibly due to rapid energy loss as accelerated electrons leave the corona , and resumes before the disappearance of the broken power - law component .",

    "this conduction also leads to the rapid decrease of @xmath33 and the associated volume decrease after about 02:18:30 ut .",
    "however there is little evidence to support a quantitative correlation between a static conductive heat flux from the _ rhessi _ thermal component and the energy change rate of the other emission components , indicating that the evaporation flow or turbulence may modify the conductive heat flux significantly @xcite . the energy decrease rate of @xmath33 from 02:18:30 ut to",
    "02:20:30 ut slightly exceeds the sum of @xmath34 and the increase rate of @xmath32 , also suggesting radiation at lower energies .       for the broken power - law component .",

    "the escape timescale for electrons producing radio emission is then given by @xmath49 using these expressions we see that for a major fraction of the acceleration phase , the escape timescale of electrons from the loop into the footpoints needs to have an energy dependence of @xmath50 with @xmath51 varying about 2 @xcite , which indicates more efficient trapping of higher energy electrons .",

    "it is likely that the escape of high - energy electrons from the acceleration site of the _ rhessi _ thermal component drives a return current .",
    "the corresponding electric field will confine lower energy electrons within the coronal loop @xcite . near the peak of hxr emission , the photon spectrum is about @xmath76 photons cm@xmath2 kev@xmath78 s@xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the photon energy .",
    "the corresponding spectrum of electrons injected into the footpoints is about @xmath80 electrons kev@xmath78 s@xmath78@xcite , which gives an electron flux above @xmath81 kev of @xmath82 electrons s@xmath78 ( see the 4th panel ) .",
    "the electron number density in the loop is about @xmath83 @xmath16 , where @xmath84 is the volume of the acceleration site ( see the last panel of figure 5 ) .",

    "the corresponding specific acceleration rate can exceed @xmath89 s@xmath78 , which is consistent with the coulomb collision timescale of roughly @xmath90 s. therefore electrons in the _ rhessi _ thermal component must be injected into the acceleration process very efficiently .",
    "the high specific acceleration rate implies that the separation of the acceleration from the electron transport within the loop may be artificial .",
    "the acceleration and transport processes might be intimately coupled to give rise to the observed photon spectra .",
    "the spatial structure along the loop and the effect of the return current in the legs of the loop @xcite need to be considered self - consistently to address this issue @xcite .",
    "moreover , according to our assumption of a stochastic accelerator with @xmath73 and the result shown in equation ( [ esc ] ) , the acceleration and escape timescales have different dependence on @xmath44 , which according to the stochastic acceleration model will not lead to an exact power - law electron distribution @xcite .",
    "theoretically the distinction between thermal and nonthermal component is ambiguous in the acceleration region since acceleration , injection , and thermalization timescales are comparable near @xmath35 . we expect a smooth electron distribution , which may be fitted with a thermal plus a power - law component @xcite .",
    "the stochastic acceleration theory we invoke here also assumes isotropic particle distributions , which may not be valid especially for high - energy electrons .",
    "more detailed modeling is needed to address this issue .",
    "by combining in - depth data analysis with the theory of stochastic particle acceleration , we are able to explore the energy release processes in a simple flare loop that occurred on 12th august 2002 in unprecedented detail .",
    "we propose that the overall energy release in this flare may be divided into the following phases : 1 ) in the preheating phases , magnetic energy is released probably via some reconnection process and turbulence is generated at large scales via some instability .",
    "this large scale turbulence cascades toward smaller scales and at the same time energizes the bulk of background particles leading to heating and expansion of the energy release site ; 2 ) in the rise phase of the nonthermal emission , the acceleration of electrons starts when the turbulence reaches small enough scales to interact with the high - energy tail of the thermal background via some resonant process and inject these electrons into the acceleration process .",
    "since turbulence that is responsible for acceleration of high - energy electrons evolves , at large scales , over a long time , the system reaches a quasi - steady state with a nearly constant spectral index of accelerated electrons .",
    "the injection is very efficient at the beginning with the escape of high - energy electrons driving a return current and suppressing the escape of relatively lower energy electrons .",
    "higher energy electrons can overcome the potential drop associated with the return current and produce hxr emission at the footpoints .",
    "the rapid energy loss caused by escape of high - energy electrons and their subsequent collisional loss in the footpoints also stops the expansion of the _ rhessi _ thermal component .",
    "this period may be considered as the most dynamical phase with the electron acceleration , injection , thermalization , and transport processes strongly coupled .",

    "4 ) the energy release rate is unable to balance the conductive energy loss rate and the _ rhessi _ thermal component starts to cool down with the volume starting to shrink .",
    "the increase of the _ goes _ thermal component appear to be driven mostly by conduction from the hotter _ rhessi _ thermal component with no evidence for evaporation driven by higher energy nonthermal electrons whose energy content is also less than that of the _ goes _ thermal component .",
    "the energy deposited at the footpoints by nonthermal electrons likely leads to heating of cooler and denser plasmas deeper in the chromosphere , which may give rise to radiation in the optical to euv range .",
    "5 ) after the overall energy release ceases , the energy increase of the _ goes _ thermal component and the related radiative energy loss is less than the energy loss of the _ rhessi _ thermal component via conduction , also indicating efficient emission at lower energies .",
    "although these results are consistent with the stochastic particle acceleration theory in general , they also suggest processes , e.g. return currents in the early acceleration phase , not covered in the simplest stochastic particle acceleration model @xcite .",
    "this study also shows that to model a specific flare in detail , the evolution of the source structure must be considered .",
    "the process of electron acceleration is intimately coupled to the electron transport processes and small scale turbulent plasma waves play an essential role in the onset of electron acceleration within a more gradual energy release process .",

    "<S> we carried out detailed analysis of x - ray and radio observations of a simple flare loop that occurred on 12th august 2002 , with the impulsive hard x - ray ( hxr ) light curves dominated by a single pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the emission spectra of the early impulsive phase are consistent with an isothermal model in the coronal loop with a temperature reaching several kevs . </S>",
    "<S> a power - law high - energy spectral tail is evident near the hxr peak time , in accordance with the appearance of footpoints at high energies , and is well correlated with the radio emission . </S>",
    "<S> the energy content of the thermal component keeps increasing gradually after the disappearance of this nonthermal component . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that electron acceleration only covers a central period of a longer and more gradual energy dissipation process and that the electron transport within the loop plays a crucial role in the formation of the inferred power - law electron distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral index of power - law photons shows a very gradual evolution indicating a quasi - steady state of the electron accelerator , which is confirmed by radio observations . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with the theory of stochastic electron acceleration from a thermal background . </S>",
    "<S> advanced modeling with coupled electron acceleration and spatial transport processes is needed to explain these observations more quantitatively , which may reveal the dependence of the electron acceleration on the spatial structure of the acceleration region . </S>"
