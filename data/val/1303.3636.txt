    "adaptive beamforming technology has received considerable attention for several decades and found widespread applications in radar , sonar and wireless communications @xcite .",
    "the optimal linearly constrained minimum variance ( lcmv ) beamformer @xcite which minimizes the array output power while maintaining the array response on the direction of the desired signal , is the most well - known beamformer .",
    "however , the computation of the inverse of the received data covariance matrix and the requirement of the knowledge of the cross - correlation vector present difficulties for its implementation .    a number of adaptive algorithms have been reported for the implementation of the lcmv beamformer @xcite , @xcite . among them",
    "the stochastic gradient ( sg ) algorithm @xcite , @xcite is popular due to its simplicity and low complexity .",
    "the drawback of the sg algorithm is that the convergence depends on the eigenvalue spread of the received data covariance matrix",
    ". this condition could be worse when the number of elements in the filter is large since it requires a large amount of snapshots to reach the steady - state .",
    "reduced - rank signal processing was introduced to provide a way out of this dilemma @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the reduced - rank schemes project the received vector onto a lower dimensional subspace and perform the filter optimization within this subspace .",
    "the advantages are their fast convergence properties and enhanced tracking performance when compared with full - rank schemes operating with a large number of parameters in the filter for the beamformer design .",
    "the reduced - rank algorithms range from the auxiliary vector filtering ( avf ) @xcite , the multistage wiener filter ( mswf ) @xcite , to the joint iterative optimization ( jio ) based works reported in @xcite , @xcite . despite the improved convergence and tracking performance achieved with the existing reduced - rank methods",
    ", they have to afford the heavy computational load as a tradeoff .    in this paper , we introduce a new lcmv reduced - rank algorithm based on the jio scheme .",
    "the proposed algorithm employs the set - membership filtering ( smf ) technique @xcite , @xcite to reduce the computational complexity significantly without the convergence speed reduction and the performance loss .",
    "the smf specifies a bound on the magnitude of the estimation error ( or the array output ) and uses the data - selective updates to adjust parameters according to this predetermined bound .",
    "it involves two steps : @xmath0 information evaluation and @xmath1 ) parameters adaptation .",
    "if the parameter update does not occur frequently , and the information evaluation does not require much complexity , the overall computational cost can be saved substantially .",
    "the current smf algorithms ( see @xcite and the reference therein ) pay attention to the full - rank parameter estimation .",
    "considering the fact that the reduced - rank algorithms exhibit superior performance over the full - rank methods @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , it motivates the deployment of the smf mechanism to the reduced - rank scheme to guarantee the good performance with low complexity .",
    "we employ the smf technique with the reduced - rank jio scheme for the lcmv beamformer design and develop the sg based algorithm for implementation . compared with the work reported in @xcite , @xcite , the devised scheme consists of a bank of full - rank adaptive filters , which constitutes the projection matrix , and an adaptive reduced - rank filter that operates at the output of the bank of full - rank filters .",
    "it provides an iterative exchange of information between the projection matrix and the reduced - rank filter and thus leads to improved convergence and tracking performance .",
    "compared with the jio based method ( with the fixed step sizes ) in @xcite , the proposed algorithm uses the smf technique to adjust the step sizes for the updates of the projection matrix and the reduced - rank weight vector , and thus has an attractive tradeoff between the convergence rate and misadjustment .",
    "furthermore , a time varying bound is incorporated in the proposed algorithm to avoid the risk of overbounding and underbounding in dynamic scenarios @xcite , and to improve the performance with a small number of update .",
    "the remaining of this paper is organized as follows : we outline a system model for beamforming and present the problem statement in section 2 .",
    "section 3 derives the proposed adaptive reduced - rank algorithm .",
    "simulation results are provided and discussed in section 4 , and conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "the most important feature of the reduced - rank algorithms is to perform the dimensionality reduction and retain the key information of the original signal in the reduced - rank received vector , which is @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the projection matrix that is structured as a bank of @xmath31 full - rank filters @xmath32^t\\in\\mathcal c^{m\\times1}$ ] , ( @xmath33 ) , @xmath31 is the rank number , and @xmath34 is the reduced - rank received vector . in what follows ,",
    "all @xmath31-dimensional quantities are denoted by an over bar .",
    "an adaptive reduced - rank filter @xmath35^t\\in\\mathcal c^{r\\times1}$ ] is followed to produce the output @xmath36    the main concern left to us is how to effectively design and calculate the projection matrix .",
    "the popular reduced - rank schemes include avf @xcite , mswf @xcite , and jio @xcite .",
    "the sg type algorithm can be employed in these schemes to estimate @xmath37 .",
    "however , it is difficult to set the step size for the existing methods to achieve a satisfactory tradeoff between the fast convergence and the misadjustment in dynamic scenarios . besides , the generation of the projection matrix is still a complicated task that increases the computational cost .",
    "in this section , we introduce a new adaptive reduced - rank algorithm based on the jio scheme and employ the smf technique with the time - varying bound to realize the data - selective updates for the beamformer design .",
    "it should be remarked that the jio scheme is selected here due to its improved performance and relatively simple implementation over the avf and the mswf ones @xcite .      in the existing full - rank smf scheme @xcite-@xcite",
    ", the filter @xmath38 is designed to achieve a predetermined or time - varying bound on the magnitude of the estimation error ( or the array output ) .",
    "this bound can be regarded as a constraint on the filter design , which performs the updates for certain received data , namely , the data - selective updates . for the reduced - rank jio scheme with the smf technique ,",
    "we need to take both the projection matrix @xmath39 and the reduced - rank weight vector @xmath37 into consideration due to the feature of their joint iterative exchange of information .",
    "let @xmath40 represent the set containing all the pairs of @xmath41 for which the corresponding array output at time instant @xmath8 is upper bounded in magnitude by a time - varying bound @xmath42 , yields ,    @xmath43    where @xmath44 denotes the transmitted data of the desired user from @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the set of all possible data pairs ( @xmath47 ) , and the set @xmath40 is referred to as the _ feasibility _ set .",
    "the pairs of @xmath48 in the set satisfy the constraint @xmath49 . in practice",
    ", @xmath50 can not be traversed allover .",
    "a larger space of the data pairs provided by the observations leads to a smaller feasibility set .",
    "that is , as the number of data pairs increases , there are fewer pairs of @xmath51 that can be found to satisfy the constraint . under this condition",
    ", we define the exact _ membership _ sets @xmath52 to be the intersection of the _ constraint _ sets over the time instants @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the constraint set to provide information for the membership set to construct a set of solutions .",
    "it is clear that the feasibility set @xmath40 is a limiting set of the exact membership set @xmath52 in practice .",
    "the two sets will be equal if the data pairs traverse @xmath46 completely .",
    "the proposed smf scheme introduces the principle of set - membership into reduced - rank signal processing and inherits the advantage of the joint optimization between the projection matrix and the reduced - rank filter .",
    "it updates the parameter vectors such that they will always belong to the feasibility set .",
    "note that the time - varying bound @xmath42 has to be chosen appropriately in order to devise an effective algorithm and avoid the risk of overbounding or underbounding .",
    "the selection of the bound will be given in the following part .",
    "in this section , we use the data - selective updates of the proposed smf scheme in the reduced - rank jio based algorithm . for the lcmv beamformer design",
    ", the proposed algorithm can be derived according to the minimization of the following cost function @xmath56\\\\ & \\textrm{subject~to}~~\\bar{\\boldsymbol w}^h\\bar{\\boldsymbol a}(\\theta_0)=\\gamma,~~\\textrm{and}~~|\\bar{\\boldsymbol w}^h\\boldsymbol t_r^h{\\boldsymbol x}(i)|^2=g^2(i ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the reduced - rank received vector defined in ( [ 5 ] ) , @xmath58 is the reduced - rank steering vector of the desired user , and @xmath59 is a coefficient that determines a set of estimates within the constraint set @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the cost function in ( [ 9 ] ) depends on the projection matrix @xmath39 and the reduced - rank filter @xmath37 .",
    "the solution of ( [ 9 ] ) should be encompassed in the feasibility set in ( [ 7 ] ) and the pairs of @xmath41 should satisfy the constraint set @xmath62 . in order to solve the optimization problem in ( [ 9 ] ) , using the method of lagrange multipliers @xcite and considering the constraint @xmath63 , we have @xmath64 + 2\\lambda re\\big[\\bar{\\boldsymbol w}^h\\bar{\\boldsymbol a}(\\theta_0)-\\gamma\\big]\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the lagrange multiplier and @xmath66 $ ] selects the real part of the quantity .",
    "note that the constraint @xmath67 is not included in ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "this is because a point estimate can be obtained from ( [ 10 ] ) whereas the bounded constraint determines a set of @xmath68 .",
    "we use the constraint with respect to @xmath69 to determine one solution and to expand it to a hyperplane by using the bounded constraint .",
    "we use the sg type algorithm to update the parameter vectors . specifically , assuming @xmath37 is known , computing the _ instantaneous _ gradient of ( [ 10 ] ) with respect to @xmath39 , equating it to a zero matrix and solving for @xmath65 , we have @xmath70\\boldsymbol x(i)\\bar{\\boldsymbol w}^h(i),\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the step size for the update of the projection matrix and @xmath72 is the corresponding identity matrix .    assuming @xmath39 is known , taking the instantaneous gradient of ( [ 10 ] ) with respect to @xmath37 , equating it to a null vector and solving for @xmath65",
    ", we get @xmath73\\bar{\\boldsymbol x}(i)\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the step size for the update of the reduced - rank weight vector .",
    "the updates of the projection matrix and the reduced - rank weight vector may spend a long time or terminate suddenly due to the misadjustment if the step sizes can not be set suitably .",
    "the second constraint in ( [ 9 ] ) can be used to set a bound on the power of the array output for adjusting the step size to avoid these problems .",
    "the predetermined bound @xcite , @xcite in the smf technique makes contributions to this topic .",
    "however , we can not often determine the bound accurately since there is usually insufficient knowledge about the underlying system , especially when the scenario is changing . in such cases , a predetermined bound always has the risk of underbounding or overbounding , both of which result in the performance degradation .",
    "it motivates us to introduce a time - varying bound to circumvent the aforementioned problems .    in the proposed algorithm",
    ", we use a time - varying bound in the second constraint of ( [ 9 ] ) to offer a good tradeoff between the convergence rate and the misadjustment by adjusting the step size values automatically following the time instant . under this condition",
    ", the update is performed only if the constraint @xmath75 can not be satisfied .",
    "this scheme provides data - selective updates ( updates with respect to certain snapshots ) for the filter design and thus reduces the computational complexity compared with the existing reduced - rank algorithms ( updates for all the snapshots ) .",
    "specifically , by substituting the update equations of ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) into the constraint on the time - varying bound , respectively , we obtain @xmath76{\\boldsymbol x}(i)}&\\textrm { if}|y(i)|^2\\geq\\delta^2(i)\\\\                      & \\\\                    0 & \\textrm { otherwise}\\\\                    \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] and @xmath77\\bar{\\boldsymbol                   x}(i ) } & \\textrm { if}~|y(i)|^2\\geq\\delta^2(i)\\\\                   & \\\\",
    "0 & \\textrm{otherwise}.\\\\                   \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] the only challenge left to us now is how to select the time - varying bound @xmath42 in the constraint to make the proposed algorithm work effectively .",
    "we introduce a parameter - dependent bound ( pdb ) that was reported in @xcite to update the reduced - rank weight vector for capturing the desired user and suppressing the interference and noise .",
    ", that is @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a forgetting factor that should be set to guarantee an appropriate time - averaged estimate of the evolutions of the weight vector @xmath80 , which is given by @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the variance of the inner product of the weight vector with @xmath83 that provides information on the evolution of @xmath80 , @xmath84 is a tuning coefficient with @xmath85 @xcite , and @xmath86 is an estimate of the noise power .",
    "this time - varying bound provides a smoother evolution of the weight vector trajectory and thus avoids too high or low values of the squared norm of @xmath80 .    until now",
    ", we finish the derivation of the proposed algorithm , which is called jio - sm - sg .",
    "a summary of the proposed method is given in table [ tab : jio - sm - sg ] , where the initialization procedure is important to start the update . from ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) , the projection matrix and the reduced - rank weight vector depend on each other , which provides an iterative exchange of information between each other and thus leads to an improved performance .",
    "the smf technique is employed in the proposed algorithm and the time - varying bound is calculated with the incoming of the received vector .",
    "it encompasses the pairs of the filter design @xmath41 in the feasibility set @xmath40 that satisfies the constraint @xmath49 .",
    "the filter updates are not performed for each time instant @xmath8 but only when this constraint can not reach ( i.e. , data - selective updates ) .",
    "the computational complexity is reduced significantly and the convergence rate is further increased compared with the existing reduced - rank methods .",
