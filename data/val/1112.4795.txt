    "a different behavior appears when the pc breaks the translational symmetry leading to a modulation of the pump ( @xmath78 , as in fig .",

    "the consequences in terms of correlations are discussed in the following sections .      from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we can now see that the assumption @xmath80 [ eqs . ( 5 - 7 ) ]",
    "is well justified as it takes into account the most relevant modes for the pump field : higher order harmonics at @xmath81 are much smaller than the ones at @xmath82 , allowing neglection of the contribution of terms with @xmath31 , i.e. modulations below the pc wavelength . on the other hand",
    ", the introduction of the modulation does not have any effect on the signal , whose main components are always the modes at the critical wave - number @xmath83 .",
    "then we restrict our analysis to the modes @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : enfourier ] ) . within this assumption ,",
    "we reduce the study of the pcopo dynamics below threshold to four coupled operators equations that in the frequency domain read @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 and @xmath88 are denoted as @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "this is also evident from the analytical correlations given in the app .",
    "[ sec : correlationsw ] .",
    "conversely , these terms are large in pcopo whenever pc is affecting the signal , i.e. , for @xmath105 .",
    "moreover , the last term @xmath106 vanishes , both for @xmath107 and for @xmath39 and @xmath105 , but it can contribute to the variance negativity for @xmath78 .    in particular , for @xmath107 , eq .",
    "( [ twin ] ) for the output fields yields the simple expression @xcite @xmath108 with shot noise @xmath109 .",
    "therefore the normalized variance is always negative and constant below threshold .",
    "this it not the case for a pcopo and in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a we show twin beams correlations normalized by the shot noise for a fixed value of the pump and different pc modulations .",
    "the opo is recovered at the origin , while the twin beams correlation is modified by the pc , becoming more classical for higher values of @xmath110 .",
    "let us consider now the case of modulation only in the signal detuning , that is @xmath39 and @xmath105 .",
    "we find for the twin beams correlations @xmath111 with shot noise @xmath112 .",
    "the normalized expression of the twin beams diverges for @xmath113 , which in turn is the expression for the threshold , eq .",
    "( [ eq : thresh ] ) ( black solid curve in fig .  [ fig7]b ) .",
    "we find that , even after normalization with the shot noise , the strength of these correlations is dependent on all parameters , while in the opo it was constant for any pump e. moreover , in fig .",
    "[ fig7]b it is clear that the correlations are degraded and can become classical below threshold ( above red line ) .",
    "finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig7]c we present normalized twin beams correlations when only the pump detuning is modulated . in this case",
    "correlations remains quantum for all pump strengths below threshold , even if there is a small reduction of this quantum effect .",
    "an interpretation of these results can be given considering the modulation effects from the microscopic point of view .",
    "a modulation in the signal ( pump ) detuning has the main effect to couple different spatial modes as also clear from eq.([eq : enfourier ] ) . in the particular case of a pc modulation with the periodicity ( [ 2kc ] )",
    "there are actually creation and destruction processes between photons at the critical tilted modes @xmath114 .",
    "even if the nonlinearity gives rise to simultaneous creation ( annihilation ) of photons pairs in the signal , spatial modulation of the signal detuning leads to photons hopping between these opposite modes .",
    "in other words there is a process of creation of one photon ( say @xmath115 ) and destruction of one in the opposite mode ( @xmath116 ) , as can be also seen from inspection of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "therefore , twin beams correlations , due to photon pairs emission , are present for small hopping rates , but when the detuning modulation of the signal is increased , the variance ( [ twin - m1 ] ) becomes classical as the twin beams are depleted uncoherently . on the other hand , for @xmath42 and modulating the detuning of the pump field ,",
    "the hopping between different pump harmonics is still detrimental , as it triggers different secondary processes besides the twin photons pairs generation , but has a reduced effect .",
    "we have shown the effect of an intracavity pc in a typical device displaying quantum light spatially correlated in continuous variables , as it is the degenerate opo type i. due to the translational symmetry breaking in the transverse profile there are several effects also evident in the noisy precursors locking ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the pc modulation has a deep influence in the instability process and parametric threshold are both raised and lowered depending on the configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . as a consequence a modification in twin beams correlations , squeezing , separability , and entanglement were expected . in order to analytically evaluate these quantum correlations",
    "we have introduced two main approximations valid below threshold , linearizing around the steady state where the signal field vanishes and restricting our analysis to few relevant harmonics ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we have considered a pc modulation ( [ 2kc ] ) and five modes , @xmath117 for the pump and @xmath118 for the signal . under these approximations we obtained good agreement between our results and the numerical solution of the full multimode nonlinear model , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lang ] ) .    in our prototype model",
    "the pc leads to a sinusoidal variation on the refractive index and , therefore , of the detunings that can affect pump , signal or both fields , depending on the values of the pc modulations @xmath119 and @xmath110 .",
    "different configurations are described by tuning these parameters .",
    "when the pc modulates the signal field , i.e. @xmath105 , the instability threshold rises in agreement with previous works concerning single resonant cavities and predicting pattern inhibition  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that in presence of a parametric process the scenario is more complex and actually the threshold can also be reduced , when @xmath78 , and the instability favored .",
    "non - classical phenomena such as squeezing and entanglement are very sensitive to the proximity of the instability point .",
    "therefore the pc has deep consequences and can improve correlations at a given pump with respect to the opo , at least when threshold is lowered ( pump modulation ) . apart from this effect ,",
    "all correlations have been compared in opo and pcopo at a fixed distance from threshold .",
    "then we have found that squeezing ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , separability , and epr - entanglement ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) are preserved both in the reached values and in the width of the quadrature and superposition angles regions where these phenomena appear .",
    "finally , we have analytically calculated twin beams correlations ( fig.[fig7 ] ) when varying the pc modulations @xmath119 and @xmath110 showing that deeper effects are actually present in these intensity correlations , even at a fixed distance from the threshold , and that in general secondary processes degrade correlations . besides , numerical simulations above threshold presented in a previous work  @xcite have revealed a significant enhancement of squeezing and entanglement .",
    "overall , the pc allows to obtain the same quantum effects at a lower energy and one can enhance / avoid quantum properties of light , just by changing pump and/or signal spatial modulation in the cavity .",
