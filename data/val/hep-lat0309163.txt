    "various condensates are related to non - perturbative properties of qcd .",
    "the importance of the condensates such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 are well - known .    though the dimension two operators such as mass terms are not brst invariant in yang - mills ( ym ) theory , it was pointed out recently that these operators contain a gauge invariant physical part and that a special combination of them can be ( on - shell ) brst invariant @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the minimum of @xmath3 along the gauge orbit can have a definite physical meaning , and how to define the physical part non - perturbatively @xcite .",
    "there is a brst - invariant composite operator of mass dimension 2 @xcite as a linear combination of @xmath4 and quadratic ghost , averaged in spacetime : @xmath5.\\ ] ] in the lorentz gauge , it reduces to the same form as the known curci - ferrari mass term .",
    "but we do not include it in the lagrangian .",
    "therefore our theory is usual ym .",
    "it is easily seen that this operator is on - shell brst invariant : @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath4 part should be divided into the physical ( transverse ) part and other unphysical ( longitudinal and scalar ) part .",
    "when we take the vacuum expectation value , the @xmath7 part precisely cancels this unphysical part .",
    "thus the operator has a gauge invariant expectation value , though the remaining physical part is nonlocal . especially in the landau gauge @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "since these operators are not brst invariant as local polynomials , they do not appear in ope of usual gauge invariant quantities .",
    "but they may appear in ope of brst non - invariant quantities such as .",
    "in fact , this operator in the landau gauge has been estimated in various methods .",
    "boucaud et al.@xcite have simulated the lattice propagator and used ope fit to obtain @xmath10 .",
    "verschelde et al .",
    "@xcite discussed the effective potential of @xmath4 .",
    "here we take the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation approach .",
    "recent investigations @xcite@xcite of euclidean pure su@xmath11 yang - mills theory in the lorentz gauge show @xmath12 the transverse gluon propagator vanishes , while the fp ghost propagator is enhanced in the infrared limit @xmath13 .",
    "that is , the ghost propagator behaves more singularly than the free propagator in low energy region .",
    "these results mean the ir ghost dominance .",
    "this is consistent with the well - known gribov prediction and the confinement criterion due to kugo and ojima .",
    "but these results are strongly dependent on approximations in the calculation .",
    "simple bare vertex approximation fails to reproduce 1-loop perturbative result .",
    "this situation is very different from the case of fermion sd equation .",
    "in addition to the approximation ambiguity , we pay attention to the in the uv propagators which may come from ope ( @xmath14 condensate ) or renormalon or some other non - perturbative effects .",
    "we consider the sd equation for the gluon propagator @xmath15 and ghost propagator @xmath16 in pure ym theory in the landau gauge .",
    "for the gluon propagator @xmath15 , we adopt the brown - penington projection @xmath17 to remove a tadpole graph .",
    "next , we neglect all 2-loop diagrams and adopt higashijima - miransky approximation to the internal propagators .    thus the relevant sd equations become @xmath18{ghost_sdeq.eps } \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath18{gluon_sdeq1loop.eps } \\end{array}\\ ] ]",
    "at this stage , in addition to propagators @xmath15 and @xmath19 , the vertices @xmath20 and @xmath21 are unknown . in the landau gauge , the ghost - gluon vertex @xmath20 does not have divergence .",
    "so our main attention directs to approximate @xmath21 .    in the investigations @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite , various ansatz are adopted to @xmath21 . in @xcite @xcite , the bare or the slavnov - taylor ( st ) improved vertex is adopted .",
    "this procedure is similar to the case of fermion sd . in @xcite @xcite ,",
    "improved vertices are used to reproduce the uv 1-loop perturbative result correctly where free parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are introduced in @xcite . it does not change uv leading exponent .",
    "bloch @xcite used a similar ansatz derived from his own argument based on multiplicative renormalizability .",
    "but in their cases , infrared solutions become very delicate in the sense that whether ghost dominance property is realized or not depends on the choice of parameters or the effect of 2-loop diagrams .",
    "the simple bare vertex approximation can not reproduce even the 1-loop perturbative result , while the ir solutions are very sensitive to the choice of vertex correction . in order",
    "to get rid of this difficulty , we consider the higher logarithmic terms in the uv asymptotic solution .",
    "we are interested in the  non - perturbative \" power correction terms too .    to obtain the solutions",
    ", we define the gluon form factor @xmath24 and the ghost one @xmath19 by multiplying @xmath25 to the propagators .    for the uv asymptotic solutions , we adopt the new ansatz which has logarithmic ( perturbative ) powers and power ( non - perturbative ) corrections as @xcite @xmath26    we use the two parameter ansatz @xcite for the renormalized triple gluon vertex @xmath27 simply introducing parameters makes a result more ambiguous . in our approach , new parameters will be automatically determined by considering subleading solutions and ope consistency .",
    "we put these into sd equations , and get infinite series of algebraic equations with respect to coefficients @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 and parameters @xmath33 .",
    "we first find that without power corrections ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) the ansatz can not satisfy the coupled sd equation for large @xmath25 , even if we include the logarithmic corrections @xmath36 .",
    "a self - consistent solution is obtained when @xmath37 for arbitrary value of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these reproduce leading exponents and beta function in agreement with 1-loop perturbation .",
    "the remaining coefficients are determined successively except for one degrees of freedom @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( overall normalization ) will be determined if we fix the renormalization condition . @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( coefficients of power correction ) are not determined . except for @xmath44 ( or ) , all the other coefficients and exponents are calculated by simple algebraic equations up to any finite orders .",
    "the logarithmic expansions seem to converge in uv region .",
    "the additional logarithmic exponent of the power correction calculated from ope is @xmath45 .",
    "corresponding exponent from the sd solutions in bare vertex approximation is @xmath46 @xcite .    in the improved vertex case ( [ results ] ) , only one unknown parameter @xmath38 governs this exponent .",
    "we use the relation ( [ results ] ) to determine the parameter .",
    "when we set @xmath47 ( or @xmath48 ) , the exponent @xmath49 becomes @xmath50 which reproduces the leading ope .",
    "moreover , this value for @xmath51 leads to the ghost dominance solution in the ir region .",
    "we have found the asymptotic sd solutions of the gluon and ghost propagators in su(@xmath52 ) yang - mills in landau gauge for the ansatz using power and logarithmic expansion .",
    "contrary to the fermion sd case , the bare vertex approximation can not reproduce the uv solution consistent with the uv perturbation and the uv ope .",
    "we have found the consistent solution by considering the uv higher order corrections .    using the same vertex ansatz ( 4 ) determined as above , we have obtained also the ir solutions which have the same form as the power - law solutions [ 6 ] : @xmath53 .",
    "therefore the existence of non - perturbative power correction does not influence the ir solution .",
    "ir ghost dominance is realized , and the color confinement criterion of kugo and ojima is satisfied .",
