    "because essentially all known protostellar or pre - main sequence objects show evidence of winds , jets , or outflows , the current thinking is concentrated on a picture of simultaneous infall and outflow , in which infall and accretion occur towards the protostellar equatorial regions , and a wind breaks out along the poles ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "yet early thinking on the stages of young stellar evolution identified a phase in which infall directly strikes the protostellar surface , with no outflow present @xcite .",
    "no clear examples are known of such protostars . in this contribution",
    "i consider limits on the timescale for purely - accreting objects in the context of the standard model of inside - out collapse from a molecular cloud core .",
    "the mathematical formulation is a generalization of @xcite , dropping the assumptions of normal force balance and quasi - stationarity to permit full time - dependence and dynamical expansion ( or collapse ) .",
    "the inside - out collapse of a singular , isothermal sphere yields a mass accretion rate @xmath4 at the center @xcite . here",
    "@xmath2 is the isothermal sound speed in the cloud core . at the origin",
    "is a protostar whose mass grows linearly in time @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the time since the start of collapse . in the presence of initial , solid - body rotation ,",
    "the infall is distorted , and accretion occurs preferentially onto the circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "the natural length scale of the distortion is the centrifugal radius @xmath7 , which grows as @xmath8 .",
    "i turn on a wind at the stellar surface , of radius @xmath9 , and numerically determine whether it can halt infall and escape . at early times ,",
    "@xmath10 and the accretion is nearly isotropic , making breakout of the wind difficult . at late times ,",
    "when @xmath11 , escape becomes easy along the poles .    for simplicity , the wind is assumed isotropic and of constant speed @xmath1 , and mass - loss rate @xmath0 .",
    "the wind and infall collide supersonically , and a shocked shell forms .",
    "low speeds imply rapid cooling and a geometrically thin shell .",
    "the dynamics of such time - dependent , thin shells has been discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "i include the inputs of mass and momentum from infall , the wind , and the gravitational force due to the protostar .",
    "for a given evolutionary time and ratio @xmath12 , i determine the minimum wind speed necessary to break out of the infalling flow .",
    "figure  [ fig : riseandfall ] shows an example calculation of a shell that fails to escape and falls back to the star . in this case , a modest increase in wind speed dramatically changes the outcome , permitting breakout of the shell from the infall region .",
    "i solved the problem in dimensionless form , which reduces the parameter space from six ( @xmath13 ) to three dimensions ( nondimensional time @xmath14 , wind speed @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) . as a result",
    ", the parameter space has been fully explored .",
    "figure  [ fig : nofit ] shows the critical wind speed for breakout . when the wind ram pressure exceeds the infall ram pressure at the stellar surface , the wind may initially push the shell upwards .",
    "but if the wind speed is less than the critical speed , the shell stalls and falls back .",
    "this is the trapped wind stage . in figure",
    "[ fig : nonsteady ] , its duration is the time between the dashed ( ram pressure balance ) curve and the solid one ( critical wind speed ) for a given ratio @xmath17 .",
    "the results of figures  [ fig : nofit ] and  [ fig : nonsteady ] may be easily scaled to apply to _ anisotropic _ winds , by comparing to an equivalent , isotropic wind having the same mass and momentum loss rates along the z - axis .",
    "indeed , at early times , the evolution is primarily determined by the momentum loss rate of the wind in this direction . at late times , it is the wind speed rather than momentum loss rate that determines breakout .",
    "it is hoped that these semi - analytic results will inspire more detailed exploration of this problem with fully radiative hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the existing literature ( e.g.  @xcite ) on this is not immediately comparable because they have used a different density law which is self - similar , unlike that of cassen & moosman .",
    "moreover , i argue that initial conditions with wind velocity much greater than the critical velocity are unphysical , as such a strong wind would have broken out at an earlier time , unless the wind itself evolves strongly with time .",
    "strong collimation of wind by anisotropic infall is not seen in the current calculations , although further exploration of this issue is forthcoming .",
    "i note that numerical simulations demonstrating strong collimation due to the circumstellar density asymmetry ( e.g.  @xcite ) have assumed a much more asymmetric density field than that used here .",
    "i am grateful to the observatoire de la cte dazur for a henri poincar fellowship and to the dpartement fresnel , umrs 5528 for hosting my postdoctoral stay in france .",
    "i also thank conacyt / mxico for financial support and s.stahler for encouragement in this work .",
