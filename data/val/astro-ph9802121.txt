    "the distance modulus to the m31 galaxy is @xmath9mag ( for discussion see e.g.  huterer , sasselov & schechter 1995 and holland 1998 ) . in this paper",
    "we follow the approach of paczyski & stanek ( 1998 ; hereafter : p&s ) and present an estimate of the distance to m31 based on the comparison between the red clump giants observed locally by the _ hipparcos _",
    "( perryman et al .  1997 ) satellite and observed in m31 with the _ hst _ ( holland , fahlman & richer 1996 ; rich et al .",
    "these stars are the metal rich equivalent of the better known horizontal branch stars , and theoretical models predict that their absolute luminosity only weakly depends on their age and chemical composition ( seidel , demarque , & weinberg 1989 ; castellani , chieffi , & straniero 1992 ; jimenez , flynn , & kotoneva 1998 ) .",
    "indeed the absolute magnitude - color diagram of _ hipparcos _ ( perryman et al .  1997 , their figure  3 ) clearly shows how compact the red clump is . in this paper",
    "we determine the variance in the @xmath10-band magnitude to be only @xmath11mag .",
    "as discussed by p&s , any method of the distance determination which is based on stars suffers from at least four problems :    1 .",
    "the accuracy depends on the absolute magnitude determination for the nearby stars ; 2 .",
    "interstellar extinction has to be determined for the stars in the target source as well as for those near the sun ; 3 .",
    "the masses , ages , and chemical composition may be different for the stars in the source and for their counterparts near the sun ; 4 .",
    "the statistical error is large if the number of stars is small .",
    "the red clump giants are the only type of stars which do not suffer from the fourth problem . in spite of their large number and sound theoretical understanding",
    "these stars have seldom been used as the distance indicators . however ,",
    "recently stanek ( 1995 ) and stanek et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1997 ) used these stars to map the galactic bar .",
    "p&s used the red clump stars observed by ogle ( udalski et al .",
    "1993 ) to obtain an estimate of the distance to the galactic center . in this paper",
    "we follow the approach of p&s and compare the absolute magnitudes of @xmath0 nearby red clump stars with accurate ( better than 10% ) trigonometric parallaxes measured by _ hipparcos _ with the apparent magnitudes of @xmath1 red clump stars observed by the _",
    "hst _ in the halo of m31 ( holland et al .",
    "1996 ) and in the m31 globular cluster g1 ( rich et al .",
    "this comparison gives the distance to m31 in a single step .",
    "inspection of the color - magnitude diagrams based on _ hipparcos _ and ogle data revealed a strong dependence of the @xmath12-band magnitude of red clump giants on their color , while their @xmath10-band magnitudes revealed no significant color dependence ( p&s , their figures  1,2 ) . thus , on purely observational grounds , the @xmath10-band seems to be the best in the applications in which the red clump stars are used as standard candles .",
    "it is possible that bolometric corrections to the @xmath10-band are very small for these moderately cool stars , and theoretical models show only weak dependence of @xmath13 on either age or chemical composition ( seidel , demarque , & weinberg 1989 ; castellani , chieffi , & straniero 1992 ; jimenez , flynn , & kotoneva 1998 ) .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ based absolute magnitude - color diagram is shown in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : cmd ] , for the stars with parallaxes measured to better than 10% .",
    "there are 664 such stars within the dashed rectangle @xmath14 $ ] in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "p&s derived the absolute magnitude of the nearby red clump stars @xmath15 .",
    "we will discuss this number later in the paper .",
    "deep cmds were obtained for several lines - of - sight towards m31 , mostly to study the m31 globular clusters ( ajhar et al .",
    "1996 ; fusi pecci et al .",
    "1996 ; holland et al .  1996 , 1997 ; rich et al .",
    "we selected the @xmath16 cmds obtained by rich et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the m31 globular cluster g1 and by holland et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for two fields ( adjacent to the m31 globular clusters g302 and g312 ) in the m31 halo ( figure  [ fig : m31 ] ) .",
    "these fields are located @xmath17 and @xmath18 from the center of m31 , respectively .",
    "the g302 and g312 cmds were corrected for the reddening and extinction using a value of @xmath19 ( burstein & heiles 1982 ) . for g1",
    ", we used a value of @xmath20 taken from schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "the red - clump dominated parts of the g302 , g312 and g1 cmds are shown in the upper - right , lower - left and lower - right panels of figure  [ fig : cmd ] , respectively . as discussed by holland et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , cmds for g302 and g312 indicate multiple stellar populations , consistent with a mix of 50% to 75% metal - rich stars and 25% to 50% metal - poor stars .",
    "this is reflected by the presence of horizontal branch stars in m31 bluer @xmath21 $ ] than the red clump stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "rich et al .  ( 1996 ) concluded that the properties of the g1 cmd are most consistent with those of an old globular cluster with the metallicity of 47 tuc .",
    "given the fact that the average luminosity of the red clump stars appears to be independent of their color , and hence metallicity , in baade s window ( p&s , their figure  1 ) and in the solar neighborhood ( figure  [ fig : cmd ] , upper - left panel ) , it seems safe to determine the distance to m31 by comparing these two populations , especially using the overlapping region in the color .",
    "following p&s , we selected the red clump stars in the color range @xmath22 in the g302 field ( 4357 stars ) , in the g312 field ( 980 stars ) and in the g1 globular cluster ( 937 stars ) .",
    "the color range was selected to correspond to the color range of the red clump stars observed locally by the _ hipparcos _ ( figure  [ fig : cmd ] , upper - left panel ) .",
    "we fitted all three distributions with a function @xmath23\\ ] ] ( please note the typo in p&s eq.1 , where the factor @xmath24 in the denominator of the exponent was , incorrectly , squared ) .",
    "the first three terms describe a fit to the `` background '' distribution of the red giant stars , and the gaussian term represents a fit to the red clump itself .",
    "@xmath25 correspond to the peak magnitude of the red clump population .",
    "we obtained the values of @xmath26 for the g302 field , @xmath27 for the g312 field and @xmath28 for the g1 cluster .",
    "this , in combination with the @xmath15 for the local red clump stars , gives preliminary distance moduli of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    the distribution of the local and the m31/g302 red clump stars as a function of their absolute @xmath10-band magnitude is shown in figure  [ fig : dist ] with two histograms as well as with two analytical fits of the type described by the eq.1 .",
    "all distributions are normalized .",
    "the gaussian fitted to the g302 field red clump distribution has a small @xmath32 and the gaussian fitted to the _ hipparcos _ distribution has @xmath33 .",
    "this difference could be due to the _ hipparcos _ stars having @xmath3410% parallax errors , broadening the derived distribution .",
    "by the same argument , the narrowness of the red clumps in m31 indicates that the _ hst _ @xmath10-band photometry is still very accurate at @xmath35mag .",
    "as we discussed above , p&s found no significant color dependence in the @xmath10-band magnitudes of the red clump stars in both the _ hipparcos _ and the ogle data .",
    "however , a visual examination of the m31 data in figure  [ fig : cmd ] suggests that the blue edge of the red clump is @xmath36mag fainter than the red edge . to investigate this effect , we divided the red clump region of the most star - rich g302 field into nine color bins and for each bin we performed the fit described above .",
    "there were between 250 and 1,050 stars in each bin .",
    "the result appears in figure  [ fig : morph ] , where we show @xmath25 for each bin .",
    "the red clump exhibits a relatively sharp downturn for @xmath37mag , but there is basically no color dependence for @xmath38mag , consistent with the result of p&s . in the color range @xmath22 , used for the comparison with the _ hipparcos _ red clump ,",
    "@xmath25 varies only from 24.22 to 24.268 and in a random fashion .",
    "the very small formal statistical error for our distance to m31 follows from the very large number of red clump stars measured by _",
    "hipparcos _ and observed in m31 .",
    "the number of these stars is several orders of magnitude larger than the number of either rr lyrae or mira variables , and the observed dispersion in their magnitudes is as small as @xmath39 in the _ hst _ data for the m31 fields .",
    "however , in addition to small statistical errors there are possibly larger systematic errors discussed by p&s , some of which we try to estimate and correct for .",
    "p&s checked if the 10% error limit adopted was not too generous , and they repeated the analysis with a more stringent 5% upper limit to the parallax errors .",
    "this reduced the number of stars within the rectangle shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] from 664 to 240 , and gave @xmath40 , within statistical errors of @xmath41 obtained for the 10% sample .    by selecting stars with accurate parallaxes from the _ hipparcos _ catalog we introduced a distance bias which depends on the absolute magnitude : the stars which are intrinsically brighter can be measured accurately out to a larger distance",
    "therefore , there are relatively more bright stars in our _ hipparcos _ sample than in a volume - limited sample . in order to estimate this effect we selected a sub - sample of 228 _ hipparcos _ stars with the distance @xmath42 , and we determined the parameters of the best fit to the luminosity function described with eq.1 .",
    "this sample is not strictly speaking volume limited , but closer to that than the previous sample .",
    "we found that @xmath43 , and @xmath44 mag for these nearby stars , with the average distance @xmath45 .",
    "as discussed by h@xmath46 g & flynn ( 1998 , their figure  2 ) , one expects very little reddening , @xmath47 , for such nearby stars , so we assume that our @xmath42 sample suffers no reddening .",
    "this is contrary to what was assumed by p&s , but agrees with detailed models of the optical reddening in the solar neighborhood ( mndez & van altena 1998 ) : we live in a bubble of low interstellar extinction ( bhat , gupta & rao 1998 ) .",
    "we therefore assume that a gaussian with @xmath48 and dispersion @xmath49mag well represents the red clump luminosity function .",
    "we believe that a @xmath50 error of @xmath51mag better represents the uncertainty of the red clump properties than the value of @xmath52mag derived by p&s .",
    "we correct the value of the galactocentric distance modulus obtained by p&s to @xmath53mag ( statistical plus systematic error ) , and the corresponding distance @xmath54 .",
    "the systematic error combines the uncertainty of @xmath55mag in the @xmath10-band zero point of the stanek ( 1996 ) extinction map ( gould , popowski & terndrup 1998 ; alcock et al .",
    "1998 ) as well as possible @xmath51mag error in the ogle @xmath10-band photometric zero point ( kiraga , paczyski & stanek 1997 ) .",
    "there are also a number of systematic errors connected with the m31 halo red clump stars .",
    "the g1 globular cluster might be at a distance that is different from the bulk of m31 .",
    "similarly , the centroid of the gaussian distribution of red clump giants in the m31 halo corresponds to the distance which might differ from the distance to the disk of m31 .",
    "however , as discussed by holland et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the depth of the m31 halo is very small ( @xmath56mag ) , so the possible shift in the m31 distance is even smaller .",
    "this is confirmed by the very similar values of distance moduli we find for the two lines - of - sight in the halo of m31",
    ". a larger contribution to the error comes from the zero point in the assumed interstellar extinction , which holland et al .",
    "( 1996 ) took to be @xmath19 ( burstein & heiles 1982 ) , but schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) advocate a lower value of @xmath57 as an average foreground reddening for m31 .",
    "however , using the schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) reddening map directly at the positions of g302 and g312 gives @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "for g1 we obtained a value of @xmath20 using the map of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , in excellent agreement with value @xmath60 adopted by rich et al .",
    "based on discussion by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and stanek ( 1998 ) , we estimate the @xmath50 systematic error in the @xmath61 reddening to be @xmath62mag , which using the relation @xmath63 translates to systematic @xmath10-band extinction error of @xmath51mag .",
    "another systematic error is the uncertainty in the wfpc2 photometric zero point thought to be as high as @xmath64mag based on calibrations by the distance scale key project ( hill et al .",
    "recently whitmore & heyer ( 1997 ) showed that the charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) for the wfpc2 ccds depended on the total number of electrons in the star image and the sky background as well as the more commonly known problem with position on the detector .",
    "corrections for the full cte effect would reduce the zero point uncertainty to @xmath51mag , but only the standard holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ramp was applied to the data presented here .",
    "fortunately the red clump stars are relatively bright , and the difference between the simple ramp cte correction and the whitmore correction amounts to only 2% .",
    "we therefore assume that the systematic error due to the wfpc2 photometric zero point is @xmath65mag .",
    "we can now derive the final distance modulus to m31 based on the lines - of - sight discussed in this paper .",
    "the straight average of red clump peak apparent magnitudes @xmath25 for the three fields is @xmath66 and the weighted mean is @xmath67 .",
    "however , as pointed out to us by the referee , if we assume that the m31 gc system is dynamically similar to the galactic gc system , then it is highly probable that g1 does not lie at the same distance as m31 but could be expected to have a distance modulus of @xmath68mag greater or smaller than that of m31 , due to g1 s location in its orbit about m31 .",
    "this appears to be consistent with g1 having @xmath25 @xmath55mag",
    "less than the mean @xmath25 of the g302 and g312 fields ( however , the difference is small enough , that it could be caused by , for example , slight uncertainty in the _ hst _ photometric zero point discussed above ) . using only the g302 and g312 field stars ,",
    "the straight average of red clump peak apparent magnitudes @xmath25 is @xmath69 and the weighted mean is @xmath70 . using this weighted mean @xmath71 combined with the distribution of local red clump stars ,",
    "we obtain the distance modulus to m31 @xmath72mag or @xmath73 ( statistical error only ) . after adding to that the systematic error of @xmath51mag due to the uncertainty in @xmath61 determination and @xmath65mag due to the zero - point uncertainty in the _ hst _ photometry , we arrive at the final value of @xmath74mag ( statistical plus systematic error ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that freedman & madore ( 1990 ) obtained very close average value of @xmath75mag for a sample of cepheids observed in baade s fields i , iii and iv ( baade & swope 1963 , 1965 ) .",
    "there is yet another type of a systematic error possible : the age , the chemical composition , and the masses of red clump giants may be systematically different in the m31 halo and near the sun .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the presence of horizontal branch stars with @xmath76 in the halo of m31 , which are basically absent in the _ hipparcos _ sample , implies that the two populations are to some extent different ( see holland et al .",
    "1996 and rich et al .",
    "1996 for more detailed discussions ) .",
    "recent stellar evolutionary models ( jimenez et al .  1998 ) indicate that in the age range 212 billion years the effective temperature is dominated by the metallicity . as we discussed earlier , by comparing the red clump distributions selected using the same color range we hope to minimize the impact of the population differences on the derived distance modulus of m31 .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : m31 ] , our three lines - of - sight probe a large range of m31 galactocentric distances and locations ( two fields along the se minor axis and one along the sw major axis ) and hence metallicities and possibly ages and star formation histories .",
    "the fact that the derived distance moduli for the three fields we used in this paper vary by only @xmath68mag indicates that indeed our approach is valid .    to summarize",
    ", among the various stellar distance indicators the red clump giants might be the best for determining the distance to m31 because there are so many of them . in particular _",
    "hipparcos _ provided accurate distance determinations for almost 2,000 such stars , but unfortunately @xmath10-band photometry is available for only @xmath77 of them , so it would be important to obtain @xmath10-band photometry for all _ hipparcos _ red clump giants .",
    "one would also like to use many more lines - of - sight towards m31 to understand better the effects of varying stellar populations and reduce the uncertainty in the _",
    "hst_/_hipparcos _ comparison .",
    "after we completed writing this paper we became aware of the paper by holland ( 1998 ) , in which he determines the distance to m31 using red - giant branches of globular clusters in m31 .",
    "his distance modulus of @xmath78mag is identical to the value of @xmath74mag we obtained in this paper ."
