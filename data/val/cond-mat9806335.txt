    "recently , two experimental groups , in saclay @xcite and at the weizmann institute @xcite , have been able to measure suppressed shot noise in a quantum point contact ( qpc ) geometry - a constriction in the plane of a 2deg . in this setup the two edges of the fqh system are brought together by applying a gate voltage that creates the qpc . in what follows we will refer to this particular geometry as tunneling between the edges of the _ same _ fqh system ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig - junctions](a ) ) . the quantum shot noise in this case reflects the fluctuations in the tunneling current that result from the presence of the constriction .",
    "the results obtained in these experiments for fqh systems at filling fraction @xmath4 are consistent with the interpretation of uncorrelated tunneling events of fractionally charged quasiparticles ( @xmath5 ) between the edges of the fqh system at the qpc .    at filling fraction @xmath1 , the hall conductance and the fractional charge of the quasiparticles",
    "are determined by the same universal coefficient , the filling fraction .",
    "thus , it is natural to ask if the noise experiments measure the fractional charge or the conductance .",
    "clearly , one way to address this issue is to extend these measurements to a range of filling fractions not in the laughlin sequence , where the charges of the quasiparticles ( in units of @xmath6 ) are not equal to the filling fraction .",
    "however , the theory of tunneling in generic fqh states is only understood qualitatively and many important issues , such as edge reconstructions , still need to be understood .",
    "in contrast , there exists a rather detailed and well understood theory of tunneling between the edges of the laughlin states .",
    "shot noise measurements can be an important probe of the edges of fqh states in other , more general , geometries .",
    "from this point of view , we consider the problem of tunneling from a fermi liquid ( _ i .",
    "e. _ , @xmath0 ) to a laughlin fqh state at filling fraction @xmath7 or , more generally , between fqh edge states with _ different _ filling fractions , @xmath8 .",
    "an instructive example is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig - junctions](b ) which is a schematic representation inspired by the geometry used in the experiments by a.  chang and coworkers @xcite .    a possible experimental realization of the geometry depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig - junctions ] ( b ) is suggested in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig - hotspot ] , where the strong tunneling region or `` hot spot '' is assumed to be designed to be small , of the order of a few cyclotron lengths .",
    "these sizes are similar to the ones in the qpc experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "= 3.0 in    in this paper we consider the more general problem of non - equilibrium noise in tunnel junctions between different fqh states .",
    "we will show here that , while noise measurements always constitute a detailed probe of the theory of the edge states , their interpretation in terms of the ( generally fractional ) charges of the quasiparticles is actually quite subtle . in particular , it is both natural and important to inquire if measurements of suppressed shot noise level in a generic qpc junction provide unambiguous evidence for fractional charge in the isolated fqh fluid and what is its relation with the conductance . in the example that we will discuss here , we will find that the level of the shot noise in the weak backscattering regime tracks the differential conductance of the junction instead of being determined by the ( fractional ) charge of the fqh quasiparticles or by the electron charge . in fact , we will also discuss an example in which in a two - terminal measurement of the shot noise level , it is impossible to distinguish between tunneling of electrons between the edges of identical laughlin states and electrons between ( carefully chosen ) different fqh states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig - nancyparadox ] ) , for instance @xmath9 and @xmath10 . logically , there are two related issues involved in this problem .",
    "one is the charge of the quasiparticle participating in the tunneling process , and another are the properties of the isolated fluids connected by the junction .",
    "= 2.0 in    let us begin by reviewing the basic theoretical assumptions and interpretations involved in the various studies of noise in tunneling between luttinger liquids . within the theoretical framework of tunneling between the edges of a given fqh system , the low temperature ( shot ) noise spectrum @xmath11",
    "is calculated in terms of the correlation function of the tunneling current , which in the geometry of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig - junctions ] ( a ) corresponds to the backscattering current @xmath12 . in this limit",
    ", the shot noise level @xmath11 is @xmath13 this result can be interpreted as meaning that the backscattering current is due to ` uncorrelated ' tunneling of laughlin quasiparticles carrying fractional charge , _",
    "i.e. _ , the current corresponds to a sequence of uncorrelated poisson distributed quasiparticles that tunnel through the qpc . this result applies provided the backscattering current @xmath12 is arbitrarily small .",
    "thus , the shot noise level for small tunneling currents reflects the charge of the carriers and , consequently , in the geometry of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig - junctions ] ( a ) , it measures the fractional charge .",
    "alternatively , in the same geometry , we may also regard the transmission current as being carried by electrons , which are strongly correlated .",
    "this description corresponds to the dual picture of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this picture",
    ", defects in the transmission of electrons correspond to backscattering of kinks ( _ i .",
    "e. _ , `` magnetic charges '' ) or quasiparticles .",
    "thus , in this representation , the suppression factor in the shot noise level is a measure of the correlations among the electrons . in this dual picture , although the transmission current is _ large _ , the fluctuations of this current ( _ i .",
    "e. _ , the noise ) are small and due to defects ( or kinks ) which play the role of the backscattering current @xmath12 in the quasiparticle picture .",
    "naturally , both pictures are completely equivalent and consistent with each other , and they yield the same result , as they should .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth to stress that the physical interpretation of the coefficient @xmath14 of the shot noise as the charge of the quasiparticle of the fqh state is not based on a direct measurement of the charge .",
    "instead , this interpretation relies on the existence of the quasiparticle picture since it is precisely the tunneling of quasiparticles which causes the fluctuations of the current in that picture .",
    "this interpretation is physically consistent because it is possible to determine independently by a transport measurement that the 2deg is in a laughlin state .    from a conceptual point of view",
    "it is then natural to ask if it is always possible to find an analog of the quasiparticle picture in which the coefficient of the shot noise is always necessarily determined by the charge of a physical eigenstate of an _ isolated _ fqh state .",
    "we will see now that answering this question leads to an interesting paradox , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig - nancyparadox ] .",
    "let us reexamine the problem of quasiparticle tunneling between the edges of a @xmath1 laughlin state but as seen from the dual picture . in this representation",
    ", we have _ electrons _ tunneling _ between _ two @xmath1 laughlin states .",
    "it turns out that , using the methods of ref.@xcite , it is straightforward to show ( see below ) that this tunnel junction is equivalent to a tunnel junction between laughlin states @xmath0 and @xmath15 in which _ electrons _ hop between the two fluids at the qpc .",
    "the paradox resides in the fact that the noise in the tunneling current is determined by a coefficient which is still @xmath16 in spite of the fact that there are no such quasiparticles in the _ bulk _ of the isolated @xmath0 and @xmath15 states . in this picture , @xmath16 is the charge of the soliton which diagonalizes the junction hamiltonian . from the point of view of a @xmath17 junction ,",
    "these states are complicated non - local superpositions of the quantum states of the two isolated inequivalent fqh fluids .",
    "the only way to distinguish cases ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig - nancyparadox ] is to determine the conductance of the fluids independently through a four - terminal measurement .",
    "in fact , a two - terminal measurement can not distinguish these two cases .",
    "it is also worth to remark that , as we will see below , the coefficient of the noise level of picture ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig - nancyparadox ] , is precisely the same ( in units of @xmath18 ) as the saturation value of the differential conductance of the @xmath17 junction !",
    "one may also ask , given a qpc between two inequivalent fqh states , if it is always possible to find an equivalent system in which the noise in the tunneling current can be interpreted as due to tunneling of quasiparticles of isolated fqh fluids .",
    "the answer to this question is _",
    "no_. we will see below that a generic qpc @xmath8 , for the laughlin states @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , is equivalent to the qpc @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "hence , the equivalent junction represents tunneling between _ fermion _ laughlin states only if either @xmath24 or @xmath25 ( but not both ) are odd integers .",
    "however , what it is always true , is the statement that the noise level is determined by the charge of the soliton ( kinks ) states that diagonalize the hamiltonian of the junction and , in general , these states can not be represented simply in terms of the quasiparticles of the isolated fluids .",
    "superficially , this result may appear to violate the basic bulk - edge correspondence which is crucial for the theory of edge states of fqh fluids@xcite , as it involves tunneling of objects which are neither electrons nor quasiparticles of the isolated fluids .",
    "actually , as we discuss below ( see also the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this is not a real paradox or contradiction since the edges are gapless and the structure of the hilbert space is respected by these tunneling processes",
    ".    measurements of noise , in addition to being useful tools to investigate experimentally the problem of fractional charge in fqh fluids , can also be used to probe the properties of the edges in greater detail . for instance , for the special and exactly solvable case of the @xmath2 junction , we calculate the current correlation functions exactly for all voltages , temperatures and tunneling amplitudes , and show that the temperature and voltage dependence of the noise contains a great deal of information on the edge states , on the fixed points of the junctions and of their crossovers . for a generic @xmath8 junction , for which the correlation functions can not be computed exactly , we find the noise in the asymptotic regimes of large and small voltages , and for high and low temperatures .",
    "the results are discussed in the form of a phase ( or rather , crossover ) diagram . to analyze the information obtained from the asymptotic regimes , we introduce a generalization of wilson ratios useful in quantum impurity problems @xcite .",
    "we define a generalized wilson ratio as the quotient between the shot noise and the thermal noise levels .",
    "near the two fixed points this ratio becomes a universal scaling function of @xmath3 independent of the coupling constant .",
    "the ratio contains information on the luttinger liquid behavior through the parameter @xmath26 both in the exponent of the @xmath3 dependence and in the constant @xmath26 dependent prefactor .",
    "the ratios in the two fixed points are also related by duality .",
    "finally , these ratios can be used to analyze the experimental data from both limits of thermal and shot noise in a unified way .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we review the model of refs .",
    "@xcite and we introduce the relations among the charge densities of the rotated and the dual fields .",
    "we also define the backscattering current @xmath12 and introduce the definitions for the noise in both currents @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in section  [ sec : mismatch ] we discuss a generic junction between two fqh states at filling fractions @xmath29 and @xmath30 . here",

    "we review ( briefly ) the refermionization procedure used to diagonalize exactly the hamiltonian for this junction @xcite .",
    "for this particular case , we calculate the noise at zero temperature in the current through the junction .",
    "we show that the noise in the limit of strong coupling ( or weak backscattering current ) is not a direct measurement of the fractional charge of the decoupled fqh fluid but , instead , it measures the charge of the soliton that diagonalizes the hamiltonian , which also determines the saturation value of the conductance of the junction . in section [ sec : noiset ] we calculate the noise in the current @xmath31 and the backscattering current @xmath12 as a function of temperature @xmath32 and voltage @xmath33 .",
    "we present our results in the form of a @xmath34 diagram for the noise . in particular , we show that the strong coupling regime relates the equilibrium and non - equilibrium regimes of the junction .",
