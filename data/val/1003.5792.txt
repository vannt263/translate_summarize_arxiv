    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the theory of the hadronic interactions .",
    "it is an elegant theory whose full non perturbative solution has escaped our knowledge since its formulation more than 30 years ago@xcite .",
    "the theory is asymptotically free@xcite and confining@xcite .",
    "a particularly good test of our understanding of the nonperturbative aspects of qcd is to study particles where the gauge field plays a more important dynamical role than in the standard hadrons .",
    "for this reason the glueball spectrum has attracted much attention  @xcite .",
    "the interest in this subject is related to the significant progress in the understanding of the properties of such states within qcd , as well as , in the new possibilities for their identification in modern experiments .    from the phenomenological point of view",
    "it has become clear by now that it is difficult to single out which states of the hadronic spectrum are glueballs because we lack the necessary knowledge to determine their decay properties .",
    "moreover the strong expected mixing between glueballs and quark states leads to a broadening of the possible glueball states which does not simplify their isolation .",
    "the wishful sharp resonances which would confer the glueball spectra the beauty and richness of the baryonic and mesonic spectra are lacking .",
    "this confusing picture has led to a loss of theoretical and experimental interest in these hadronic states .",
    "however , it is important to stress , that if they were to exist they would be a beautiful and unique consequence of qcd .",
    "a comprehensive review on the experimental status of glueballs has recently appeared @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of this paper we accept the existence of at least one pseudoscalar glueball state although its existence has been a matter of debate since the mark ii experiment proposed glueball candidates @xcite .",
    "note that the pseudoscalar sector is a complex one . on the one hand it accommodates the goldstone nature of the pseudoscalar multiplet , on the other , not totally unrelated , we encounter the singlet - octet mixing , which is traditionally associated with the resolution of @xmath5 anomaly . in constituent models",
    "the ideal mixing ( @xmath6 ) is natural , however the @xmath0 and @xmath7 mixing is non ideal .",
    "gluon self - couplings in qcd suggest the existence of glueballs , bound states of mainly gluons @xcite .",
    "investigating glueball physics requires an intimate knowledge of the confining qcd vacuum and it is well known that such properties can not be obtained using standard perturbative techniques . to handle the non - perturbative regime of qcd",
    ", one can resort to numerical methods , known as lattice qcd .",
    "lattice qcd needs as input the quark masses and an overall scale , conventionally given by @xmath8 .",
    "then any green function can be evaluated by taking average of suitable combinations of lattice fields in vacuum samples .",
    "this allows masses and matrix elements , particularly those of weak or electromagnetic currents , to be studied .",
    "however lattice qcd faces both computational and fundamental problems in the description of glueballs @xcite . a complementary way to describe glueballs , namely the mit bag model , implements in a dynamical way the phenomenological properties of the confining qcd vacuum and the interaction among the gluons .",
    "historically the investigation of the glueball properties started precisely in this model @xcite .",
    "jaffe and johnson found many glueball states with different quantum numbers lying in the mass interval 1000 - 2000 mev .",
    "they emphasized that one should expect rather small widths for such states because their decays in conventional hadrons violate the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present investigation is the study of the mixing between a possible pseudoscalar glueball state and the @xmath0 or @xmath2-mesons .",
    "the calculation has been performed in the mit bag model , a description which imposes by fiat some of the properties of qcd . in this model",
    "a hadron is basically a bubble of perturbative vacuum in the midst of a non - perturbative vacuum . inside the bubble we insert the constituents , which are described by cavity modes , and the surface of the bubble screens color from flowing into the non - perturbative world .",
    "the calculation has been performed in the so - called spherical cavity approximation , where several improvements have been incorporated , like center - of - mass corrections and the recoil correction . in this setup ,",
    "the cavity is fixed to be a sphere and its radius is allowed to vary dynamically . within this scheme",
    "we have performed two calculations of the mixing hamiltonian .",
    "one , in which we have used the cavity propagator for the quarks .",
    "this cavity propagator is made up of a sum over all possible cavity states .",
    "thus it incorporates , in principle , the confining property of the bag model .",
    "another , in which we have used the free propagator which is made up as a sum over free modes .",
    "as it turns out , the results of both calculations are almost the same , so the dominating property , at least for the problem investigated here , is asymptotic freedom .    our investigation is presented as follows . in [ mixings ]",
    "we show the necessary tools to carry out the calculation .",
    "starting from the qcd lagrangian we use a formalism that allows one to calculate the mixing energies perturbatively by means of the appropriate feynman diagrams .",
    "we have to introduce for this purpose the bare glueball and meson states . in sec .",
    "[ propagators ] , we discuss the quantization , which is important since the problem at hands is a multi - particle one . after discussing the role of the propagator in sec . [ propagators ] , and addressing and resolving an important physical problem that arises in bag model calculations in sec . [ recoil ] , we present and comment on the results in sec . [ results ] and give some conclusions in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the actual calculations have been relegated to the appendix to ease the reading of the main text .",
    "we next calculate the mixing energy , which corresponds to off - diagonal hamiltonian terms in fock space . in subsection",
    "[ formalism ] , we introduce a formalism which allows the calculation of the mixing energies in a perturbative manner . in subsection",
    "[ states ] we present the bare glueball and meson states in the bag model .",
    "thereafter we discuss important aspects of the calculation      qcd is a non - abelian yang - mills theory with a @xmath9 gauge symmetry regarding color charge .",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath10 where @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the gell - mann matrices and @xmath14 are the structure constants of the @xmath15 algebra",
    ". some rearrangement yields @xmath16 where we can identify the free lagrangian of qed ( @xmath17 ) with color indices , a quark - quark - gluon vertex ( @xmath18 ) , a 3-gluon vertex ( @xmath19 ) and a 4-gluon vertex ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we use a perturbative approach inside the cavity following the scheme developed by maxwell and vento@xcite .",
    "the glueball and meson states represent solutions of the free lagrangian @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the equations of motion arising from the lagrangian of qcd are @xmath23 and @xmath24 eqs . and can be understood as an inhomogenous dirac equation and maxwell equation , respectively .",

    ", we will restrict ourselves to the one - fermion exchange , since this is the leading - order diagram of the meson - gluon interactions .",
    "the lowest - order gluon exchange diagram , shown in fig .",
    "[ fgexchange ] , does not contribute , because the gluon is a spin-1 particle and therefore does not couple to the spin-0 pseudoscalar meson or glueball .",

    "however , since they are of a very different shape , one should expect them to generate different results . physically , it is not clear which propagator is preferable . on the one hand , virtual fermion",
    "are not constrained to the bag as the bound states are . on the other hand ,",
    "the bound states are not momentum eigenstates , so the problem does not resemble a scattering process and there is no 4-momentum conservation at the vertices .",

    "thus , the integrations of eq . might be formally carried out ( although for specific quark masses , there arise unphysical divergences ) , but the physical interpretation remains unclear .",
    "it is also unclear , why the @xmath130-integration ( corresponding to the lower vertex ) has to be carried out but the @xmath131-intergration does nt , so that there will be an energy denominator only related to the energies at the lower vertex .",
    "apparently , there must be a ( physical ) flaw somewhere .",
    "in fact , the flaw lies within the bag .",
    "when virtual particles that violate energy conservation are being created , a center - of - mass motion must be expected that ultimately alters the energies of the states .",
    "this process will be taken into account here and we will call this the recoil correction . through the emission and absorbtion of the virtual fermion the states will obtain an additional center - of - mass motion energy @xmath132 and @xmath127 , respectively as seen in fig .",

    "unquenched calculations should produce a lower value as happens for the scalar glueball @xcite .",

    "he gives a coupling constant @xmath145 to obtains a @xmath146 glueball mass of about @xmath147 mev in sharp contrast with the old calculation of jaffe and johnson @xcite , who chose parameters closely related to the baryon spectrum . in order to perform our mixing calculation",
    "we shall take for the mesons the experimental values , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the mixing probability strongly depends on the glueball mass and it turns out to be an analytic function of it , @xmath150 where @xmath151 this comes about from the diagonalization of the matrices @xmath152 when one puts in the angle @xmath153 , @xmath154 being the mixing energy , into the expression for the mixing probability @xmath155 .    in order to confront the experimental situation",
    "let us vary the mass of the glueball following the bag model prescription , i.e. @xmath156 where we have eliminated @xmath157 by the pressure balance equation and we used the the lowest te and tm modes to calculate the glueball energy .",

    "the @xmath2 can mix up to @xmath167 for small glueball masses and up to @xmath168 for large strong @xmath169 .",
    "we obtain a scenario strongly dependent on the glueball mass .",
    "if the glueball mass is close to the lattice value the pseudoscalar glueball should arise as an almost pure state with very distinct features , if on the contrary the mass is small it might mix with the @xmath2 but never with the @xmath0 .",
    "a caveat we have not considered in our calculation is the mixing between the @xmath99 and @xmath98 as mentioned before .",
    "this mixing would increase the mixing probability of @xmath0-glueball due to its @xmath98-component and decrease the mixing of @xmath2-glueball , due to its @xmath99-component .",
    "thus our calculation point towards a scenario with small mixing of the pseudoscalar glueball with the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "we have performed a calculation of the mixing of the pseudoscalar glueball with the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "our work suggests that the mixing is small if the mass is around 2500 mev . in the framework of the bag model ,",
    "this is a new result . a previous study by carlson and hansson@xcite suggests a much larger mixing .",
    "however , a small glueball mixing , in this glueball mass range , is as well favored by recent studies @xcite .",
    "accordingly , glueball mixing should not play an important role in the @xmath0-@xmath2 mass splitting .",
    "this also implies that a rather undiluted , well - defined , narrow and therefore long - living pseudoscalar glueball state should exist .",
    "if the mass of the glueball is closer to that of the @xmath2 , around @xmath170 mev , then the mixing is larger and the consequences of phenomenological analyses should be reanalized , since the amount of mixing would determine if the glueball behaves more like mesons and baryons , i.e. large objects .    the conceptual difference between our work and other bag model calculations , like the one carried out by carlson and hansson @xcite , is the recoil correction .",
    "the recoil correction is in our opinion a necessary ingredient to carry out the calculations in a physically meaningful way by avoiding spurious singularities .",
    "the bag model in the static spherical cavity approximation fails in describing the creation and absorption of virtual particles , because in the spherical cavity , the mode energies are discrete and fixed .",
    "thus energy conservation at the vertices is generally not possible .",
    "this subtle problem has been neglected in all previous bag model calculations so far . in our calculation",
    "it manifested in an ( unphysical ) singularity dominating the results . our way",
    "to resolve this problems is to take into account the recoil that arises on particle emission and absorption , manifesting itself necessarily in center - of - mass motion of the constituents .",
    "we add this energy to the energy of the constituents .",
    "this not only eliminates the singularity and makes way for meaningful results , but it is necessary to cancel out the time - dependence of the mixing energy . without the recoil correction , the mixing energy is oscillating , which is also a sign of center - of - mass motion problems .",
    "all of these hints suggest that the recoil correction is correct , physical meaningful and must be applied to all bag model calculations .    at this point",
    "it is worth mentioning a technical error which despite its simplicity has been in the field for many years .",
    "the normalization constant eq . in the case of massive quarks for the quark mode wavefunction",
    "was written incorrectly , most probably a typo , in the original paper  @xcite , but the error has been carried on by all papers that we have used thereafter . luckily the error does not imply large effects in the calculations of the light quarks .    in our work , we have neglected the mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath2 and rather identified the physical states with the singlet and octet states .",
    "a more elaborated calculation would be a three - particle mixing scheme between @xmath0 , @xmath2 and the glueball .",
    "nevertheless , since the mixing between the mesons and the glueball that we have obtained is so small , a three - particle mixing scheme will hardly produce very different results and therefore we have decided to settle for the two - particle mixing scheme",
    ".    this work has set the standards for future calculations within the mit bag model scheme .",
    "any calculation dealing with the spectrum or mixings will have to follow the same procedure and approximations .",
    "in particular an interesting phenomena which we are now revisiting is the mixing of @xmath99 and @xmath98 to build the true physical @xmath0-mesons .",
