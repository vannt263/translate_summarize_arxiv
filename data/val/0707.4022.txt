    "one of the successful routes to the description of strongly correlated systems is related to the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite . in this scheme",
    "the system is mapped onto an effective local quantum impurity problem in a self - consistently determined bath .",
    "the self - energy in the dmft approach is local in space but frequency dependent .",
    "however , there are many phenomena for which non - local correlations are important and often correlations are long - ranged . among these",
    "are luttinger - liquid formation in low - dimensional systems , non - fermi - liquid behavior due to van - hove singularities in two dimensions or d - wave pairing in high-@xmath0 superconductors . obviously , dmft is not suitable for the description of such systems and there are cases in which dmft even fails qualitatively , as is for example the case for the one - dimensional hubbard model . for the description of these non - local correlations",
    "it is desirable to combine short - range cluster many - body physics , like formation of singlets , and long - range correlations .",
    "recently the novel dual fermion approach for the treatment of nonlocal correlations has been developed@xcite . here",
    "we formulate a general cluster ( or multi - orbital ) scheme for non - local correlations .",
    "frequently used approaches to account for non - local correlations beyond dmft comprise the cluster approaches or the so - called dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) in k - space @xcite , real space periodic @xcite and free cluster approaches @xcite , as well as the cellular - dmft @xcite(cdmft ) . in the latter approach ,",
    "the single - site impurity of the dmft is replaced by a cluster of impurities .",
    "the cdmft scheme however is restricted to relatively small cluster sizes due to computational feasibility and only short - range correlations can be treated within this approach@xcite .",
    "recently , steps have been taken to go beyond dmft and to treat long - range correlations .",
    "one of them is the dynamical vertex approximation@xcite and similar approaches@xcite , where a diagrammatic expansion around dmft is made . a principally new scheme with a fully renormalized expansion called dual fermion approach has been proposed@xcite , which is based on the introduction of new variables in the path integral representation .",
    "similar schemes for the strong coupling expansion have been discussed in terms of hubbard operators @xcite .",
    "here we present a cluster generalization of the dual fermion approach .",
    "this allows the treatment of clusters or multiorbital atoms within the dual fermion framework and can describe long - range correlations in realistic systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , we present the formalism and then show that for the case of non - interacting dual fermions one exactly obtains the self - consistency equation of the cdmft . in the next section we consider the relationship between the two - particle green functions in real and dual variables .",
    "then we describe the calculation procedure .",
    "we finally apply our approach to the hubbard model in one dimension starting from a two - site cdmft solution .",

    "this outer loop is also executed until self - consistency .",
    "self - consistency for both loops is usually reached after a few iterations ( depending on the system ) .",
    "the computational cost for the calculations aside from dmft is less than for the dmft itself , whereby the computation of the vertex is the computationally most expensive part .",
    "we use the continuous - time quantum monte carlo impurity solver@xcite for the solution of the impurity problem and for the calculation of the irreducible vertex .",

    "for the 2-site free cluster dmft the renormalization of the vertex has a small effect since the cdmft is already a good starting point . for the single site calculation",
    "the renormalization is essential since dmft even gives a qualitatively wrong answer , while the dual fermion result correctly predicts the system to be an insulator . ]",
    "due to the absence of a mott transition in one dimension , the system is an insulator for any finite value of the on - site repulsion @xmath12 .",
    "it is known that single - site dmft gives a qualitatively wrong answer , i.e. predicts the system to be metallic even for @xmath12 as large as @xmath71 .",
    "here we compare our results with the one obtained by a density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculation @xcite , since dmrg is known to reproduce the spectral properties of 1d systems quite well .",
    "the free cluster dmft solution obtained in our calculation is qualitatively correct and reproduces the dmrg solution quite well , since short range fluctuations between nearest neighbours are predominant . for our calculations",
    "we use the parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the dmrg solution corresponds to @xmath73 . for the calculation we considered only the first two lowest order diagrams in the series expansion shown in fig .",

    "the renormalization of the vertex has a small effect , since the cdmft result is already close to the exact solution .",
    "however , the free cluster dmft result is considerably improved and the result agrees very well with the one obtained in the dmrg calculation .",
    "almost the same result was obtained without changing the vertex .",
    "we further plot the result for a single - site calculation .",
    "here single - site dmft wrongly predicts the system to be metallic .",
    "hence the dmft solution strongly differs from the exact solution and the renormalization of the vertex becomes important .",
    "nevertheless , the dual fermion solution converges to a metallic solution within a few iterations .",
    "we have generalized the recently proposed dual fermion approach to the multiorbital case , facilitating the treatment of multiorbital systems within this framework .",
    "we further established the relation between the four - point correlation functions in real and dual variables and found that the two - particle excitations for real fermions and dual fermions coincide .",
    "the approach was applied to the one - dimensional hubbard model starting from the free two - site cluster dmft solution .",
    "although the cdmft solution already quite well reproduces the dmrg solution , the cluster dual fermion solution considerably improved this result .",
    "the cluster formulation allows to combine this approach with realistic density functional calculations and thus opens a new way to describe long - range correlations in real systems .",
