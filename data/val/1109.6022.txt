    "the dark matter halos in which galaxies are embedded are satisfactorily modeled as smooth quasi - isothermal spheroids , such as hernquist ( 1990 ) or navarro - frenk - white ( nfw , 1997 ) functions , as described in authoritative texts such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "such mass models , with addition of the visible stars , gas and dust , can adequately account for most of the observed internal kinematics of galactic systems . on the other hand , n - body simulations of the formation of dark matter halos robustly predict that approaching 10% of the mass of any galactic dark halo should be in the form of sub - halos with numbers that rise steeply towards lower masses @xcite .",
    "the baryonic disk and bulge components of a galaxy will lead to sub - halo depletion in the central regions @xcite relative to a pure dark matter model .",
    "although galaxies do contain visible dwarf galaxies embedded in dark matter sub - halos , the numbers are far short of the many thousands expected .",
    "hence , it appears that either the predicted sub - halos are very dark , or , substantially not present .",
    "an accurate census of the relatively low mass completely dark sub - halos remains a significant challenge . in principle the dark matter itself must have some cross - section for interaction with either itself or baryons , which could potentially give rise to annihilation radiation , but so far there is no clear association of gamma - rays with known sub - halos @xcite .",
    "the gravitational effects of the large numbers of sub - halos quickly average with distance .",
    "sub - halos are potentially detectable through micro - lensing of multiple - image background sources @xcite",
    ". the anomalous flux ratios of multiple image gravitational lenses are explained with the addition of at least one moderately massive sub - halo projected onto the central region of the galaxy @xcite , but this is not a detection of a vast population . over a hubble time",
    "sub - halos lead to heating of some @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "such heating is not easily detectable in most of the visible components of a galaxy .",
    "the ongoing discovery of thin , low mass , stellar streams in galaxies opens up the possibility that the sub - halos can be detected through their gravitational effects on star streams .",
    "in particular , sub - halos that pass near or through a star stream create a gap in the stream @xcite .",
    "detecting gaps in stream pseudo - images is observationally less expensive than measuring stream kinematics .",
    "the challenge of the image analysis is that the stars in any image are overwhelmingly in the foreground or background and the signal above the statistical noise at any point in the stream is often fairly low .",
    "detections of gaps and lumps have been claimed with good statistical confidence for the pal  5 stream @xcite , the 100 kpc nw stream of m31 @xcite , the eastern banded structure of the galaxy @xcite and discussed for the orphan stream @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a basic analytic prediction of the rate at which sub - halos create visible gaps in star streams as a statistical measure of the numbers of sub - halos present .",
    "the relation can be applied to either simulations or observational data . in principle , the density of dark matter sub - halos ( and other bound structures ) in a galactic halo is simply measured with the number of times they cross a stellar stream to create visible gaps @xcite .",
    "the rate at which gaps are created in a stream is the product of the density of sub - halos , the distance between sub - halo and stream which creates a gap , and the velocity at which sub - halos cross the stream . to use this simple measure of sub - halo density we need to allow for the mass spectrum of sub - halos and determine what range of velocities and impact parameters create visible gaps . in this paper",
    "we use a set of restricted n - body simulations to help develop a gap creation rate formula .",
    "the last step is to compare the rate predictions to the available data on gaps in the star streams in the milky way and m31 as a test of the cdm sub - halo predictions .",
    "the rate at which gaps are created in a long thin stellar stream is the rate at which sub - halos of mass @xmath8 with local volume density @xmath9 cross the stream , integrated out to the maximum impact parameter , @xmath10 , which creates a detectable gap .",
    "full n - body simulations of the sub - halo content of halos find that the distribution of sub - halos , @xmath9 , is separable into a radial dependence , @xmath11 , and a mass function , @xmath12 , such that @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 function is expected to have a large variation from one galaxy to another @xcite .",
    "the rate per unit length at which sub - halos cross the stream to create gaps is therefore , @xmath14 the factor of @xmath15 arises from the consideration that at a distance @xmath10 from the stream , for any point on a circumference @xmath16 , half the stars will be headed inward in a velocity distribution without flows .",
    "this analysis will assume that the velocity distribution is gaussian and isotropic , but more general distributions could easily be incorporated .",
    "the gap rate integral , equation  [ eq_ratedef ] , depends on the visibility of gaps with the distance of closest approach , mass and velocity of a sub - halo .",
    "these factors can be evaluated using numerical simulations which determine the average outcome of a single sub - halo passing near or through a stream of particles . here",

    "an individual sub - halo is adequately modeled as a @xcite sphere with the mass - scale radius relation found in the aquarius simulations , since for our purposes the exact details of the internal mass distribution are not important . the sub - halo motion is simply at a fixed velocity in a straight line , so it crosses the ring only once which avoids the complications of a sub - halo orbiting and having multiple ring crossings .",
    "a single sub - halo is started at a distance of the ring radius from the ring .",
    "the time step is 0.001 unit of @xmath21 at 30 kpc , or about @xmath22 yr .",

    "a series of simulations is done varying the angle with respect to the tangent to the ring in the direction of motion over @xmath23 [ 41 , 60 , 90 , 104 , 120 , 139 ] degrees , and the angle with respect to the plane of the ring of @xmath24 [ 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 270 , 300 , 330 ] degrees .",
    "together these two distributions non - redundantly coarsely sample an isotropic velocity dispersion field .",
    "the encounter velocities are varied over [ 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.8 , 1.2 , 1.6 ] times the circular velocity .",

    "we chose a relatively massive sub - halo , @xmath28 , which has a scale radius of 0.83 kpc .",
    "the sub - halo is moving at @xmath29 .",
    "the top two rows show impact parameters of 0.06 kpc , where the sub - halo significantly penetrates the ring .",
    "the bottom row shows an encounter with an impact parameter of 1.5 kpc , about twice the sub - halo scale radius .",
    "the outcome at late times in all cases is that the ring is primarily perturbed perpendicular to the plane with loops pulled out .",
    "note that in figure  [ fig_xyz ] the vertical extent of the loops is stretched a factor of 220 .",
    "the ratio of the upward and downward loop heights depends on the angle @xmath30 , as illustrated in the two upper rows .",
    "the upward or downward extension also varies with time as the perturbed particles pass through the orbital plane . for the large @xmath10 relative to @xmath31 passage of in the bottom row of figure  [ fig_xyz ] ,",
    "the vertical deflection of the ring particles is somewhat larger than in the upper two rows , but there is essentially no visible gap in the ring density .",
    "the top two rows suggest that the density gap depth and length is insensitive to the angle @xmath30 , the angle relative to the orbital plane .",
    "the gaps in these completely cold rings have a very simple morphology , whereas the gaps created in more realistic stellar streams with internal velocity dispersion and a finite width are much more complex @xcite .",
    "in particular real gaps are often slanted to the centerline .",
    "old streams can be subject to so many encounters that the remaining segments of the stream are relatively dense clumps smaller than the gaps between .",
    "if the progenitor is on a fairly epicyclic orbit the tidal stripping episodes occur at perigalacticon and lead to additional structure in the stream .",
    "therefore the simplified model presented here is intended to be a statistical guide to the analysis of streams , not a detailed description of any particular stream .",
    "we measure the xy projected linear density relative to the unperturbed density using the distance , @xmath32 between every third particle .",
    "the relative density is then @xmath33 , where n is the number of particles in the ring and @xmath34 is its radius .",
    "figure  [ fig_denphi ] shows that the density profile , of the gap is effectively independent of @xmath30 , the encounter angle with respect to the plane .",
    "the particles that are stretched out in the loop pile up at the edges of the gap .",
    "the dependence of the depth of the density dip in the gap with @xmath10 is shown in figure  [ fig_den3 ] , showing that although a loop is pulled out , there is little density dip for encounters significantly beyond the sub - halo scale radius .",
    "the relative density at the bottom of the dip is displayed as a function of the ratio of the impact parameter to the scale radius , @xmath35 , in figure  [ fig_gapdensity ] .",
    "the density measurements are averaged over all angles , @xmath36 and @xmath30 .",
    "the results are displayed for velocities of 0.8 , 1.2 and 1.6 @xmath37 .",
    "since the ring particles are moving at the circular velocity there is a range of encounter velocities with the particles in the ring .",
    "if the sub - halo velocity is significantly below the circular velocity there will be no very low velocity encounters in the frame of an individual star and the sub - halo , so on the average the gaps will be less deep .",
    "however since encounters below @xmath38 comprise only about 10% of the encounters we leave them out of the average .    we need to determine the maximum impact parameter that creates a visible gap .",
    "we will model the behavior of the density dip as a function of @xmath35 as a step function at a value @xmath39 , with visible gaps created for @xmath40 and no gaps for larger @xmath10 values .",
    "we evaluate the value of @xmath41 at  of the unperturbed density .",
    "the resulting critical values of @xmath35 are function of both mass and time , as shown in figure  [ fig_brmt ] . using a density dip of  yields larger values of @xmath42 , but its use turns out to give values within our overall modeling uncertainties .",
    "the function @xmath39 has a significant time behavior . at early times , roughly before 2 gyr , the gaps are not well developed and we exclude them from the fit . over a hubble time",
    "the value of @xmath42 nearly doubles .",
    "the time behavior is mainly relevant for dynamically young streams or the young part of streams that are still being created where we will expect the stream to be far less gapped than our average value .",

    "fits which exclude the mildly non - linear @xmath27 sub - halos give nearly equal values .",
    "we now have the elements to evaluate the gap creation rate , equation  [ eq_ratedef ] .",
    "the maximum impact parameter which creates a gap is @xmath45 where we will use the 7 gyr value of @xmath42 , roughly the average over a hubble time .",
    "the mean approach speed to the ring is the integral over @xmath46 which is @xmath47 for a gaussian velocity distribution .",
    "the rate integral then becomes an integral entirely in the mass distribution , @xmath48 the aquarius simulations @xcite find that @xmath49 kpc and that the mass distribution function is @xmath50 .",
    "the mass function gives the total number of sub - halos contained within the volume , @xmath51 , that has a mean interior density 50 times the critical density which has a radius 433 kpc @xcite .",
    "putting these pieces together we find , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the smallest mass halo that creates a visible gap . the normalizing density in the @xmath51 of the radial density variation , @xmath11 , of the sub - halo population volume is @xmath54 .",
    "the mass integral is dominated by the smaller masses so we have set the upper mass limit to infinity .",
    "evaluating the integral , choosing a local @xmath55 and converting to astronomical units , we find , @xmath56 where we have used the @xcite measurement for @xmath11 ( their fig .",
    "11 ) which finds that the sub - halo density at 100 kpc is 6 times the mean within the @xmath51 volume .",
    "the rate at which gaps are created increases as the minimum mass sub - halo that can create a noticeable gap goes down , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "halo - to - halo sub - halo number differences @xcite will lead to @xmath5850% or so variation in the rate in a specific halo .",
    "an important observable quantity is the length of the gaps .",
    "we measure the length as the distance in the orbital plane between the two outside points at  of the vertical maximum of a loop .",
    "the length of a gap should be related to the distance that the loop of ring particles is pulled out of the orbital plane , that is , as the vertical extension of the ring increases , so does the length of the visible gap .",
    "this means we first need to understand the dynamics of the vertical perturbations .",
    "the impact approximation and the tidal approximation are the two general approaches used to describe the interaction of a satellite , such as a sub - halo , with a set of particles , the stars in the stream .",
    "the impact approximation is best suited to calculating deflections of individual stars from the rapid passage of a satellite and the tidal approximation is best suited to problems involving the differential gravitational field across a finite sized object .",
    "both approaches are useful for calculating the gravitational heating of the perturbed objects and at their root both have the same underlying gravitational dynamics .",
    "the impact approximation assumes that both a sub - halo and a star stream orbit can be approximated as straight lines and sets aside the possibility that orbital resonances play a significant role .",
    "a sub - halo of mass @xmath8 moving past a star at a relative velocity @xmath59 with a distance of closest approach @xmath10 will induce a velocity perpendicular to its direction of motion in the direction of closest approach of @xmath60 . since many of the encounters partially intersect the stream the relevant mass will be @xmath61 , the mass enclosed within the impact parameter , not the total mass of a sub - halo . for an orbit",
    "that is approximately circular at radius @xmath34 and taking @xmath62 to be in the vertical direction , then conservation of angular momentum requires that the maximum orbital deviation out of the plane is @xmath63 .",
    "we need to average over sub - halos crossing at all angles to the ring tangent and to the orbital plane . to a first approximation forces in the horizontal plane",
    "do not add to the angular momentum around the normal to the plane of the orbit , but do act to coherently increase the epicyclic motion around the guiding center , but that makes little difference to the stream density .",
    "a sub - halo moving at an angle to the orbital plane initially pulls the stream down and then up , which evolves into a paired set of peaks perpendicular to the orbital plane , as shown in figure  [ fig_xyz ] .",
    "the vertical extent of the perturbation is measured as the vertical distance from the positive peak to the negative peak , rather than the measurement of the absolute value of the offset from the initial orbital plane for a horizontal sub - halo passage .",
    "the resulting @xmath64 distribution is shown as a binned average in figure  [ fig_binzmax ] .",
    "the mean is about 30% higher than the prediction , with about a factor of two scatter above and below the line . for our use",
    "the scale offset is not an issue .",
    "the tidal approximation is an alternative description of the encounter of a sub - halo with a stream . the hill radius , @xmath65{m/(3m_t)}$ ] , inside of which the gravitational field of the sub - halo , mass m , begins to dominate over the gravitational field of the total mass interior to the orbit of the stream , @xmath66 .",
    "the plot of the vertical deflections against hill radius is shown in figure  [ fig_z_vs_rhill ] using the same data and same vertical scale as figure  [ fig_binzmax ] .",
    "although the vertical perturbation and the hill radius are strongly correlated there remains a larger scatter than with the impact approximation . including a power of @xmath10 finds that @xmath67 removes some of the scatter",
    "this is hardly surprising since with the addition of @xmath59 this becomes the impact approximation formula , multiplied by a constant .",
    "an alternative tidal quantity is the differential tidal field , which is proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "a plot of the vertical deflections against @xmath68 is mainly scatter .",
    "we conclude that the impact approximation is better at predicting the vertical deflections than the tidal approximation .",
    "star streams have a mean particle motion close to the circular velocity .",
    "therefore the encounter speed between a sub - halo and a star in the stream , which is required for the impact approximation , will on the average be higher than the mean circular velocity .",
    "a consequence is that low velocity encounters of sub - halos with the stream are extremely improbable . taking the mean encounter along the stream to be @xmath37 and the velocity dispersion in the two axes perpendicular to the stream as @xmath69 the typical relative velocity is @xmath70 . using @xmath71 in the outer part of a galactic halo",
    "then the typical sub - halo star relative encounter velocity is @xmath72 .",
    "the full triple velocity integral has the complication that there is a singularity at relative velocity of zero .",
    "physically this would correspond to the velocity of the stream s progenitor sub - halo . inserting a very small  core \" velocity of about one meter per second , we find that the mean encounter velocity is @xmath73 . combining these factors we find that on the average , @xmath74      the length of a sub - halo induced gap as a function of the sub - halo parameters is needed to determine what gaps are large enough to be visible .",
    "we measure the gap length at @xmath75 of the maximum vertical height as a conservative approach .",
    "the basis of a relation is visible in figure  [ fig_binwidth ] in which gap lengths relative to @xmath76 are plotted for a ring at 60 kpc .",
    "we see that for substantially penetrating encounters , @xmath77 , that the ratio of the gap length to the vertical extent , @xmath78 , is roughly a constant at a given mass .",
    "rings at smaller radii have relatively larger values of the length to height ratios , partly because @xmath76 includes an @xmath34 factor the ratio is dependent on the radius . defining @xmath79 as the length of the gap relative to the value of @xmath76 we can find an approximate fit for the mass and radial dependence over the range of 30 to 100 kpc to give , @xmath80 the function @xmath81 appears to have no significant time dependence , once the gaps develop . at radii below 30 kpc",
    "the @xmath82 value becomes somewhat larger than equation  [ eq_w33 ] gives .",
    "the predicted length of a gap is the product of the average @xmath82 and the impact equation  [ eq_impact ] for the vertical height of the loop in the star stream , @xmath83 approximating a sub - halo density profile as a hernquist profile we find that the mass inside the scale radius is @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "evaluating the numerical factors we find , @xmath85 we now have an equation that gives the typical gap length as a function of sub - halo mass averaged over the velocity distribution .",
    "the gap length - mass relation can either be used as a consistency test , or , taken a step further and be used to eliminate the unobservable minimum mass parameter from the rate equation in favor of a minimum gap length .",
    "the width of the stream and the minimum visible gap size are linked through orbital dynamics .",
    "the stream width is largely the result of stars emerging through the tidal lagrangian points with low initial velocity dispersion .",
    "the epicyclic approximation describes the subsequent motion of the stars with small velocity dispersions around a guiding center .",
    "an epicycle has comparable amplitudes in the direction of the motion and perpendicular to the motion , hence the stream width and the random motion along the stream are of nearly equal size .",
    "provided that the phase angles of the motion are not significantly correlated , any induced gap narrower than the stream width will be blurred out .",
    "therefore we make the assumption that the width of the stream is equal the minimum gap size and use it to estimate the minimum mass sub - halo that creates a gap , @xmath86 solving equation  [ eq_wdef ] for @xmath18 we substitute it into equation  [ eq_rate ] to give the gap creation rate as a function of the width of stream , @xmath87 for @xmath4 in kpc , where we have used equations  [ eq_b33 ] and [ eq_w33 ] .",
    "equation  [ eq_w_rate ] recasts the gap rate in terms of an observable , assuming that the cdm halo substructure model gives the correct density of sub - halos . over the range of 20 - 100 kpc where streams are generally found the factors of @xmath11 and @xmath34 partially counteract each other to reduce the radial variation .",
    "equation  [ eq_w_rate ] is an observational test of the cdm sub - halo prediction .",
    "counting gaps in a star stream requires considerable statistical care because the available observational data has streams embedded in a background which usually overwhelms the stream and is generally variable along the stream s length .",
    "a reliable measurement depends on having a good estimate of the density errors along the stream .",
    "the pseudo - images of stream star densities on the sky after filtering a star catalog with a color - magnitude relation can be usefully indicative but gaps should only be counted on extracted stream densities with local error estimates .",
    "we concentrate on four streams , the nw stream of m31 , and the pal  5 , eastern banded structure and orphan streams of the milky way .",
    "all of these have published estimates of the linear density of stars along the stream .       in the m31 nw star stream with moving average of 5.5 kpc ( top ) and 2.5 kpc ( bottom ) .",
    "the hatched areas are the @xmath88 average error of the mean .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the overall m31 pandas imaging project and the streams are described in @xcite and the details of the nw stream in @xcite . here",
    "we use the linear density profile to estimate the number of gaps . in figure",
    "[ fig_moving ] we show the density field as a function of the angle around the star stream , with all quantities measured as reported in @xcite .",
    "the plots are made with a moving average over 5 and 11 bins of 0.25 , or roughly 2.5 and 5.5 kpc , respectively . to determine what scales in the stream appear to be physically correlated we plot the cross - correlation of the stream density minus the mean value with itself in figure  [ fig_m31_dcor ] .",
    "we see that the stream densities are positively correlated over the first three bins of 0.25 , after which the fluctuations are essentially random .",
    "this correlation length is comparable to the width of the stream and helps validate the assumption that leads to equation  [ eq_wdef ] .",
    "therefore the smallest size scale we search for gaps in these data is about 1 , or , 2 kpc .    to count the gaps we need to have a good measure of the level of statistical fluctuations .",
    "the cross - correlation of the data with itself , at shifts beyond 5 bins , where there is no intrinsic signal , provides an accurate internal estimate of the variance of the density field .",
    "the product of two normally distributed random variables is distributed like a modified bessel function of the second kind and has a large kurtosis , 9 , as compared to a normal distribution with a kurtosis of 3 .",
    "however , the sum of many products ( 115 in our 0.25  sample ) converges to a gaussian distribution in accord with the central limit theorem .",
    "the kurtosis of @xmath89 sums of products is @xmath90 so declines fairly quickly to the gaussian value of 3 with increasing @xmath89 .",
    "the variance around the mean density of the data within the stream region , prior to background subtraction , is 1.22 ( stars / kpc)@xmath91 , and a comparable 1.33 in the background region .",
    "the background subtracted mean stream density has a variance of 6.16 ( stars / kpc)@xmath91 . the f ratio of the measured variance over the randomly expected variance is 6.16/(1.22 + 1.33)=2.42 , which has a random chance of occurrence of less than @xmath92 .",
    "larger bins give even higher significance that the measured stream density has variations well in excess of what is expected from random fluctuations . the conclusion and the levels of significance are in accord with the results presented in @xcite but use an independent line of argument which does not rely on an explicit calculation of shot noise statistics .",
    "an estimate of the number of gaps is simply to count the number of times the density crosses down and up through some density threshold , requiring that the gap be at least the size of the smooth length . for a 5 point moving average at [ @xmath93 density levels",
    "we find [ 11,11,15 ] gaps of mean length [ 7.1,6.9,15.1 ] bins , or , [ 1.8 , 1.7 , 3.8 ] kpc .",
    "taking the stream length to be 200 kpc and assuming an age of 10 gyr we find from the @xmath94 gaps that the m31 nw stream has been subject to a mean gap creation rate of @xmath95 gaps kpc@xmath96 gyr@xmath96 . in principle",
    "the predicted rate also includes any sufficiently massive object , but the detectable mass is well above the range for globular clusters and we do not expect molecular clouds along the large radius orbit of the nw stream .",
    "the rate equation , equation  [ eq_rate ] , applied to the m31 nw stream requires a minimum sub - halo mass of @xmath97 and implies a total of 205 sub - halos , which is a factor of 7.3 higher than 28 known dwarf galaxies of m31 @xcite but includes objects out to 433 kpc , of which the only the inner 150 kpc radius volume has been carefully searched .",
    "therefore the m31 stream not demand a huge dark matter sub - halo population by itself , but this analysis does recover the well known discrepancy which begins to appear for even fairly massive sub - halos .",
    "a narrow stream is predicted to have more visible gaps relative to wider stream at larger radius .",
    "the globular cluster pal  5 has both leading and trailing streams with the northern , trailing , arm having the most data in the sloan survey . with data made available before dr1",
    "@xcite found the stream to be about 6 degrees long and measured the width to be 0.11 kpc . with the better coverage of the sdss dr4",
    ", @xcite found that the northern arm was about 18.5  and provided a surface density contour plot showing the considerable variation in the surface density of the stream .",
    "the density variations closest to the cluster are convincingly explained as epicyclic pileups of stars tidally stripped from the cluster @xcite , however beyond about 1kpc ( 2.5 degrees ) the variation in phase angles smooths out this behavior . from the published figure  3 of @xcite we count regions in the stream below the lowest contour to find that there are about 5 gaps over the outer 16  of the northern tail of pal  5 .",
    "@xcite estimated that the 5 - 6  of stream took about 2 gyr to fill out , which scaled to the 18.5  length gives an age of about 7 gyr . with these values",
    "we estimate the linear gap creation rate in the northern stream of pal  5 to be about 0.11 kpc@xmath96 gyr@xmath96 to which we assign an error of 50% based on uncertainties in the gap counts and stream age .",
    "@xcite finds that the eastern banded structure is 0.17 kpc wide and located at a galactocentric distance of about 15 kpc .",
    "figure  4 of his paper plots the density along the 18  of the stream , with an estimate error of 30% in each bin of 0.5 .",
    "we estimate that there are between about 4 and 12 gaps along the stream .",
    "we will take the stream age to be approximately 7 gyr to derive a gap creation rate of @xmath98 gaps kpc@xmath96 gyr@xmath96 , with about a factor of two uncertainty in this value .",
    "the estimated rate of gap creation in the ebs stream with equation  [ eq_rate ] implies a minimum halo mass of @xmath99 .",
    "the derived minimum mass implies a total of @xmath100 sub - halos , although we note that both the mass and in turn the implied total number of sub - halos are sensitive to the gap rate estimate and the details of the model in equation  [ eq_rate ] .",
    "possible complications for the ebs stream is that the sub - halos are subject to erosion by the disk and bulge @xcite and the stream may encounter smaller scale structures such as spiral arms and molecular clouds which could add to gaps in the stream .",
    "the orphan stream @xcite has received considerable attention , culminating with a detailed orbital model @xcite .",
    "increasing the mean distance from 20 to 30 kpc revises @xcite s estimated width of 700 pc to 1 kpc .",
    "gaps are marginally present in figure  5 of @xcite at -16  and -31 , particularly when compared to the bottom panel of their figure  17 .",
    "we estimate that there are 2 gaps present , although we will allow a 100% error on this estimate .",
    "@xcite present a model that estimates the age of the stream to be about 3.9  gyr .",
    "if we had used the dynamical age of 3.9 gyr rather than a uniform 7 gyr the correction would raise the orphan data into better agreement with the prediction .",
    "rr rrr rr m31-nw & 12 & 200 & 5 & 10 & 100 & 6 + pal  5 & 5 & 6.5 & 0.11 & 7 & 19 & 24 + ebs & 8 & 4.7 & 0.17 & 7 & 15 & 30 + orphan & 2 & 30 & 1.0 & 3.9 & 30 & 20 +",
    "the observed stream gap rate and width estimates are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the results of this paper are largely encapsulated in figure  [ fig_gaprate ] , which plots the measured and predicted gap rates against the widths of the streams .",
    "the data have all been rescaled to a galactocentric distance of 100 kpc using @xmath101 and @xmath34 in equation  [ eq_w_rate ] .",
    "the agreement of the data and the cdm sub - halo prediction is remarkable .",
    "we show the relation for an arbitrary shallower @xmath102 normalized to have the same number , 33 , sub - halos above @xmath27 present in the lcdm prediction .",
    "if one used the visible dwarf galaxies to predict the number of sub - halos the predicted density of gaps in these streams would be roughly a factor of 100 smaller , which would be in wild disagreement with the observation of virtually any gaps at all .",
    "the numerical consistency that we find is both an indirect and statistical test for the existence of the large predicted population of dark matter sub - halos .",
    "the orphan stream merits further observational attention since the available measurements are potentially consistent with it being a stream with no gaps .",
    "there is room for variation in these statistical estimates , but when the other streams work fairly well with the adopted cdm spectrum the orphan stream is expected to fall into line and could potentially be a case against a rich sub - halo population in our galaxy .",
    "this paper lays a basis for understanding the rate at which dark matter sub - halos create visible gaps in stellar streams . restricted n - body experiments guide a calculation based on the impact approximation .",
    "the outcome is a prediction of the local rate at which gaps are induced in a stellar stream which effectively counts the number of sub - halos massive enough to produce visible gaps .",
    "the rate of gap creation is cast as a relationship with the stream width , which gives a predicted relationship between observables that tests the cdm sub - halo prediction .",
    "comparison of the cdm based prediction of the gap rate - width relation with published data for four streams shows generally good agreement within the fairly large measurement errors .",
    "the result is a statistical argument that the vast predicted population of sub - halos is indeed present in the halos of galaxies like m31 and the milky way .",
    "the data do tend to be somewhat below the prediction at most points .",
    "this could be the result of many factors , such as the total population of sub - halos is expected to vary significantly from galaxy to galaxy , allowing for the stream age would lower the predicted number of gaps for the orphan stream and possibly others as well , and most importantly these are idealized stream models .",
    "there are many improvements possible to strengthen , or , destroy this result .",
    "each observed stream could be realized through an n - body model and inserted into an appropriate model of a sub - halo rich galactic halo .",
    "the result would still be statistical but the various time dependent and mass dependencies would be fully taken into account . on the observational side the presence or absence of a particular gap in a stream are somewhat uncertain due to the relatively low signal to noise of streams at the present time .",
    "a statistically robust measure of the number of gaps needs to be developed .",
    "however , the observations are improving quickly and much more secure gap descriptions will soon be available .",
    "overall , within our simplified general modeling of sub - halos crossing streams to create gaps , we finding a perhaps surprisingly good agreement between data acquired for other purposes and the cdm prediction of a large population of sub - halos .",
