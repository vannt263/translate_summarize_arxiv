    "pseudopotentials form a useful part of the toolkit of methods for calculating the properties of interacting atoms in a variety of environments.@xcite they simplify solving the hamiltonian by reducing the number of electrons that need to be considered and replacing the singular coulomb interaction between the remaining electrons and the nuclei with a smooth , although usually non - local , effective potential . here we present pseudopotentials that may be used with the majority of many - body techniques , although our primary interest is their use in quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations .",

    "@xcite the use of pseudopotentials reduces the effective value of @xmath1 , making qmc calculations feasible for systems with heavy atoms .    designing pseudopotentials for 3d - transition metal atoms",
    "is of particular interest .",
    "obtaining an accurate description of molecules and bulk systems containing transition metal atoms presents a important challenge , primarily due to the strong electron - electron correlation that they exhibit . transition metal atoms are particularly important@xcite and constructing accurate pseudopotentials for them is demanding .    in a recent paper we presented a new type of correlated electron pseudopotential ( cepp ) @xcite that uses a many - body generalisation of the preservation of the independent - electron scattering properties that defines the semi - local norm - conserving pseudopotential",
    "this generalisation , together with data from atomic multi - configuration hartree - fock ( mchf ) calculations , provides a pseudopotential that includes correlation effects from the start.@xcite    the primary limitation of our method is that the pseudopotentials are generated from systems containing only a single valence electron . for almost all elements this restricts us to generating pseudopotentials from ions , rather than neutral atoms .",
    "consequently , we must justify transferring a pseudopotential obtained from calculations with a single valence electron to systems that are close to neutral .",
    "our previous paper @xcite demonstrated excellent pseudopotential transferability for the atoms h and li@xmath0f .",
    "however , the 3d - transition metals place a greater demand on transferability . a larger number of electrons must be considered as valence electrons , resulting in pseudopotentials generated from highly ionised atoms . the primary goal of this work is to demonstrate that cepps also exhibit excellent transferability for the 3d - transition metals .",
    "we will consider our goal to have been achieved if the cepps provide a significant improvement over hartree - fock ( hf ) pseudopotentials generated from neutral atoms , and reproduce relativistic all electron ( ae ) coupled cluster results to within chemical accuracy .",
    "pseudopotentials provide an uncontrolled approximation to the interaction between the core and valence electrons , in the sense that there is no parameter whose increase causes the error to monotonically decrease .",
    "the associated uncontrolled error means that it is necessary to test the performance of a pseudopotential over a wide range of systems .",

    "the cepp method may be viewed as a generalisation of standard independent electron norm - conserving pseudopotential theory@xcite to the many - body case .",
    "it is based on the preservation of scattering properties for interacting electrons , and reduces to the standard norm - conserving pseudopotential for non - interacting electrons in an effective one - body potential .    in summary , we start by calculating the many - body wave function for an isolated atom , including electron - electron correlation .",
    "we represent this @xmath4-electron fully correlated ae atom as a @xmath4-body density matrix .",
    "a spherical ` core - region ' is then defined , and the @xmath4-body density matrix is reduced to an @xmath5-body density matrix outside of this core region , where @xmath5 is the number of valence electrons .",
    "the density matrix within the core region takes a model form , chosen such that the entire @xmath5-body density matrix represents the ground state of an @xmath5-electron pseudo - atom .",

    "this approach was previously found to provide accurate pseudopotentials for first row atoms . @xcite",
    "relativistic effects are expected to be more important for the 3d - transition metal atoms , and therefore we have included them in the ae atom , and in the core represented by the cepp .",
    "the density matrix of the ae atom with @xmath4 electrons is denoted @xmath6 , and a density matrix that represents the same scattering properties to order @xmath5 is given by the reduced density matrix,@xcite    @xmath7    where the co - ordinates with indices @xmath8 to @xmath5 are outside of the core region of the isolated atom .",
    "a generalisation of the one - body lders relation@xcite to the many - body case shows that having the correct @xmath5-body density matrix outside of the core region is sufficient to preserve the scattering properties .",
    "details are available in the literature.@xcite    the core region is defined as a sphere of radius @xmath9 , centred on the nucleus . here",
    "we limit ourselves to a single valence electron , so the required condition corresponds to conserving the charge density outside of the core region .",
    "the density of the @xmath8-electron pseudo - atom is defined as @xmath10 with @xmath11 the natural orbitals ( nos ) of the ae atom ordered such that the associated occupation numbers , @xmath12 , are monotonically decreasing with @xmath13 . the pseudo - density in the core region , @xmath14 ,",
    "is given by the standard troullier - martins form.@xcite the first @xmath15 nos are excluded to ensure that the cepp is equivalent to the norm - conserving pseudopotential for non - interacting electrons , and excluding these ` core ' nos provides a pseudo - atom with the same scattering properties as the ae atom modified such that the core is entirely contained within the core region .",
    "the pseudopotential is then obtained as the effective potential that results from inversion of the radial schrdinger equation ( se ) , with the same spatial angular momentum quantum number as the ae state .",
    "we divide space into three regions . within the asymptotic region @xmath16 , defined by @xmath17 ,",

    "the potential is again obtained by direct inversion of the se , using the same eigenvalue as in region @xmath20 .",
    "the ground state solution of a one electron se with the resulting effective potential , @xmath25 , then reproduces the charge density of the pseudo - atom accurately , with a negligible error due to the asymptotic form used in region @xmath16 .    since we are considering relativistic states",
    ", a different potential channel arises for distinct @xmath26 quantum numbers of the underlying ae state .",
    "each set of channels with the same spatial angular momentum quantum number , @xmath27 , is then weighted by @xmath28 and averaged , to provide the averaged relativistic effective potential ( arep ) for use in a non - relativistic hamiltonian.@xcite ( spin - orbit coupling can be taken into account by employing the appropriate differences , but this has not been addressed here . )",
    "furthermore , we subtract the one - body part of the semi - empirical core polarisation potential ( cpp),@xcite so that the one - body part of the core - valence interaction potential is entirely _ ab initio _ when the pseudopotential is applied together with the cpp .    denoting the potential arising from ground states with spatial angular momentum @xmath27 as @xmath29 , the @xmath30 channel of the cepp",
    "is then given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the short range truncation function used to remove the nonphysical singularity at @xmath33 , @xmath34 are empirically defined cutoff radii , and @xmath19 is the same polarizability as used in region @xmath16 .",
    "application of the method described above to generate cepps requires the nos for the isolated ion .",
    "gaussian basis calculations for isolated atoms are unsuitable , since the exponential asymptotic behaviour of the nos is vital to ensure that the inversion process provides the correct asymptotic limit .",
    "we use the atsp2k mchf code@xcite that describes the correlated wave - function as a multideterminant expansion with orbitals that are tabulated on a radial grid and free to relax . in order to describe core - valence and intra - core correlation , core electron excitations",
    "are included in the active space ( as ) for these calculations .",
    "relativistic effects are included by performing a post - mchf configuration - interaction ( ci ) calculation using a hamiltonian that includes breit - pauli terms.@xcite the atsp2k package also provides the ae nos tabulated on a numerical grid , together with the associated occupation numbers .    only a finite number of orbitals can be included in the calculation , which are indexed by an angular momentum eigenvalue @xmath36 , and an index analogous to the primary quantum number of hydrogenic atoms , @xmath37 .",
    "for all atomic calculations we have employed the largest ranges of @xmath37 and @xmath36 possible without linear dependency problems preventing convergence . in practice , this provides @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and the removal of a @xmath40 and @xmath41 orbital .",
    "these ranges , together with single and double excitations of both the core and valence electrons , define the as used for the 3d - transition metal ions considered .    in almost all applications we will seek to transfer the pseudopotentials to systems that are far closer to neutral than the generating ionic states .",
    "consequentially , we modify the core in the mchf calculations to represent that of a neutral atom , rather than the generating ion . freezing the core of the ion to that of the neutral atom",
    "is achieved via two ae mchf atomic calculations .",
    "first ` relaxed core ' mchf results are generated for the neutral atom , with all orbitals and determinant expansion coefficients free to vary . from the resulting orbitals we select the @xmath15 core orbitals .",
    "next , we perform a ` fixed core ' mchf calculation by including the neutral atom core orbitals in the active space ( as ) , not allowing them to relax . in this second calculation ,",
    "all determinant expansion coefficients are free to vary , but only those orbitals that are not ` fixed core ' are free to relax .",
    "this second mchf calculation provides the final set of nos , @xmath42 .",
    "note that the second calculation provides an ion with the same core orbitals as the neutral atom , but with different core nos .",
    "when the nos are used in eq .",
    "( [ den2 ] ) , they provide a pseudo - atom and pseudopotential with the core fixed to that of the neutral atom .",
    "a complete as is equivalent to allowing core orbitals to relax , therefore our fixed core orbitals can be viewed as defining a finite as biased towards the neutral atom .",
    "the most important physical parameters are those that define the core itself , that is the number of core electrons , @xmath43 , the core radius , @xmath9 , and the cpp parameters , @xmath19 and @xmath44 .",
    "the inadequacy of a frozen [ ar ] core ( @xmath45 ) is well established for ae calculations and for defining pseudopotentials for the 3d - transition metals,@xcite hence a [ ne ] core ( @xmath46 ) is used here .",
    "the core radius , @xmath9 , should be large enough that the core density left out of eq .",
    "( [ den2 ] ) is negligible outside of it .",
    "we take @xmath9 to be the radius containing @xmath47 of the core charge excluded from eq .",
    "( [ den2 ] ) , multiplied by @xmath48 for non - local channels , and by @xmath49 for the local channel .",
    "this empirical rule was obtained by noting that the transferability of the pseudopotential is expected to worsen with increasing @xmath9 . with this in mind , we found the largest core radii ( and shallowest pseudopotential ) for ti such that the performance of the cepp in tio@xmath3 has not yet begun to deteriorate , and scaled this with the core radius for other atoms .",
    "for all atoms considered fewer than @xmath50 core electrons fall outside of the core region .",
    "parameterised cpps are required for both the generation and application of the cepps .",
    "we employ the shirley - martin@xcite parameterisation , although these authors do not supply core - polarizabilities and associated @xmath44 parameters for the [ ne ] cores of the 3d - transition metal atoms .",
    "the inversion process used in generating the cepps can provide the core polarizability from the asymptotic form of the cepp .",
    "however , parameterising the asymptotic behaviour is prone to numerical error , so instead we use the core polarizabilities calculated semi - classically by patil@xcite that agree well with experimental values .",
    "these polarizabilities also agree well with the asymptotic form of the cepps .",
    "we define @xmath44 to be the same for each @xmath36 , and equal to the radius containing @xmath47 of the core charge excluded from eq.([den2 ] ) .",
    "the particular value chosen can be expected to have a minimal effect on the performance of the cepp+cpp , since the one - body part of this potential does not depend on @xmath44 .",
    "the remaining parameters are defined by requiring that the associated errors are small . the local channel , @xmath51 , in eq .  ( [ semiloc ] )",
    "is defined such that the orbitals present in the dominant configuration of the neutral atom ground state have a maximum spatial angular momentum quantum number of @xmath52 . for the 3d - transition metal atoms this criterion provides cepps with s , p , d , and f channels , and a local f channel .",
    "the s , p , d , and f channels are generated from the lowest energy ae states with terms @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .    for the transition metal atoms with small cores , @xmath60 plays a more important role than in the first - row .",
    "this occurs due to the inclusion of fixed core orbitals from the neutral atom in the as of the ion , and because the asymptotic decay of orbitals in a many - body atomic system is given by@xcite @xmath61 where @xmath23 is the first ionisation energy , and @xmath62 is a constant that depends on the nos .",
    "since neutral core orbitals are present in the ion as , our ae calculation provides nos that exhibit a mixture of the exponential decay associated with the neutral atom and the ion .",
    "the ionisation energy of the neutral atom is usually less than that of the ion , and hence the exponential decay of the neutral atom eventually dominates . in terms of the potential arising from inversion of the schrdinger equation ,",
    "this manifests itself as a large non - physical smooth step at large radii , corresponding to a pseudopotential with an incorrect asymptotic form .",
    "( for core orbitals that are free to relax , such a non - physical step does not occur and the asymptotic behaviour is correct . )    figure  [ fig1 ] shows an example of this behaviour for the ti@xmath63 cepp generated with @xmath64 , for which region @xmath16 is absent .",
    "just before this smooth step occurs the cepp shows the expected , and physically realistic , asymptotic behaviour , hence the most straightforward way to remove this anomalous step is to choose an appropriate value of @xmath60 . setting @xmath60 as the radius at which the deviation of the cepp from the asymptotic potential is smallest provides an effective solution , resulting in values of @xmath60 varying between @xmath65 a.u .  over all channels and atoms considered .",
    "for all atoms considered fewer than @xmath66 core electrons fall in the region @xmath67 . figure  [ fig1 ] also shows the corrected ti@xmath63 cepp generated with such a choice for the inner radius of region @xmath16 .",
    "note that for the first row atoms such a non - physical smooth step was also present , but was considerably more shallow , and occurred much further from the core than for the very ionised transition metal atoms .",
    "this weaker step was indistinguishable from the unavoidable numerical noise in the mchf orbitals far from the nucleus , so there was no need to consider it as separate from this numerical error .",

    "the eigenvalue used in the inversion is not available , so we employ the finite @xmath60 value . on the scale of this figure a cepp constructed without fixed core orbitals",
    "is indistinguishable from the finite @xmath60 result . ]",
    "to allow these pseudopotentials to be used in a variety of applications , we require them to be expressed as an expansion in gaussian functions .",
    "we employ the same gaussian expansion and optimisation procedure used previously.@xcite    before commencing with cepp generation and testing , we note some of its properties . although the cepp is defined in terms of the charge density , this definition does not invoke ks - dft ( kohn - sham density functional theory ) , hence there is no error due to the non - linearity of exchange correlation functionals .",
    "this is an important advantage of the cepp approach over traditional ks - dft pseudopotentials , since a large part of the transferability error for the latter appears to be due to this non - linearity.@xcite    for mean - field pseudopotentials the variation in the effective potential due to self - consistency introduces an error in scattering properties that is neglected by norm - conservation , even at @xmath69 order.@xcite an advantage of explicitly including correlation effects in the definition of the pseudopotential is that such an error does not occur , since the hamiltonian is not defined self - consistently .    the core that is removed in our definition of the cepp is not unique .",
    "this is unavoidable for a many - body description of an atom .",
    "however , defining the core in terms of the nos with the highest occupation number is a natural generalisation of the core definition used in the familiar norm - conserving pseudopotential method .",
    "self - consistent orbitals and nos are equivalent for independent electrons , both provide the density in a diagonal form ( see eq .",
    "( [ den2 ] ) ) , and the nos provide the most rapidly convergent multideterminant expansion of all choices of orbitals.@xcite    perhaps the least predictable error in the cepps arises from the transfer of the pseudopotential from a highly ionic atom to a neutral system . from the generation procedure , we can expect this transferability error to be smaller than in ks - dft , since our cepps reproduce many - body scattering properties and are not vulnerable to the same exchange - correlation errors as ks - dft pseudopotentials .",
    "our approach of generating the pseudopotential by introducing the core of a neutral atom can be expected to further improve this transferability .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that our definition of the cepp in terms of an ion with a single valence electron is not a requirement of the underlying theory : in general the cepp may be defined as the potential that results in the @xmath5-body pseudo - density matrix for an atom with @xmath5 valence electrons .",

    "more ti molecules have been considered than for the other metals due to the technological importance of many of its compounds.@xcite we focus on diatomic molecules , due to the computational cost of ccsd(t ) , but also include the tih@xmath97 and tio@xmath3 molecules to check for pseudopotential transferability beyond diatomics , and due to the importance of bulk polymorphs of tio@xmath3.@xcite ground states are considered for each molecule , and three excited states are included for the tin molecule to provide a further test of the transferability of the cepps .",
    "while this test set is in no way complete , it covers a wide variety of chemical bonding behaviour .",
    "the chosen molecules and terms are listed in table  [ tab:2 ] .",
    "we begin with geometry optimisation .",
    "overall , the cepps provide geometry parameters with a mean absolute deviation ( mad ) from the ae results that is 75% of that for the bfd pseudopotentials .",
    "the maximum deviation of the cepp geometry parameters from the ae results is 47% of that for the bfd pseudopotentials .",
    "perhaps the most important improvement is that for the cepps all geometry parameters are within chemical accuracy ( of @xmath104   ) of the relativistic ae results .",
    "the small underestimate of the bond lengths ( the mean deviation is @xmath105   ) can be ascribed to a combination of basis set error , the absence of a cpp , and transferability error .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows optimal geometry parameters for all pseudopotentials as deviations from the baseline ae results .        the greatest improvement in accuracy provided by the cepps appears in the dissociation energies , @xmath72 .",
    "overall , only 9 dissociation energies fall outside of chemical accuracy ( of @xmath106 ev ) , with a maximum deviation for mnn of only @xmath107 ev .",
    "the mad is @xmath108 ev . this mad is 43% and 22% of the equivalent quantity for the bfd and tndf pseudopotentials , respectively .",
    "the improvement is just as pronounced when considering outliers , with a reduction in the magnitude of the maximum error to 45% and 22% of that for the bfd and tndf pseudopotential results , respectively .",
    "the mad for the cepps is less than chemical accuracy , whereas for both bfd and tndf , it is greater .",
    "similarly , 20 and 21 dissociation energies fall outside of chemical accuracy for bfd and tndf pseudopotentials , respectively , more than twice as many as for the cepps .",
    "a further improvement is that the errors for the cepps shows less bias , with a mean difference between pseudopotential and ae results of @xmath109 ev , compared with an average bias of @xmath110 ev for the bfd pseudopotentials , and an average overestimate of @xmath111 ev for the tndf pseudopotentials .",
    "note that the mad error for the cepps is less than the average bias error for the bfd pseudopotentials .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows dissociation energies , @xmath72 , for all pseudopotentials as deviations from the baseline ae results .",
    "we may quantify the importance of core - valence correlation by considering cepp calculations with the cpp excluded , and by considering ae calculations with no core excitations allowed ( but with relaxed core orbitals ) .",
    "excluding cpps increases the mad by only @xmath112 ev , and ae calculations without core excitations result in a mad of @xmath113 ev . the small effect of excluding core - valence correlation strongly suggests that the improved accuracy of the cepps when compared with hf pseudopotentials is primarily due to better transferability , rather than the inclusion of core - valence correlation .",
    "harmonic zero point vibrational energies ( zpves ) were obtained from numerical total energy derivatives at the optimised geometry .",
    "basis set convergence is easily achieved for the harmonic zpves , hence we use the @xmath75 basis set for the ccsd(t ) calculations , with the cpp included in the hamiltonian .    for the calculated zpves ,",
    "the deviation of the pseudopotential results from ae results is well within chemical accuracy for all three pseudopotentials , with a mad from ae results of @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 @xmath117 for the cepp , bfd , and tndf pseudopotentials , respectively .",
    "total energy curves for tic evaluated using the cepp within ccsd(t ) , and the aug - cc - pvtz basis set .",
    "results from calculations that both include and exclude the cpp are shown , with an offset added to the total energies to place the minimum at @xmath118 . ]",
    "closer examination of tic demonstrates the errors that may arise if the cepp is not used together with the cpp , primarily due to the relatively large core polarizability of both ti and c. using the cepp+cpp combination results in a zpve of @xmath119 @xmath117 , in good agreement with the ae result of @xmath120 @xmath117 . excluding all of the cpp results in a zpve of @xmath121 @xmath117 , in poor agreement with the ae result .    closer examination of the potential energy curves arising from the cepp+cpp combination and the cepp alone make this difference even more apparent .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows such curves in the region of the equilibrium bond length , with an offset introduced to locate the minimum for both curves at zero energy .",
    "the changes in equilibrium bond length and dissociation energy are insignificant compared with chemical accuracy , with the cpp decreasing the bond length by @xmath122   , and increasing the dissociation energy by @xmath123  ev .",
    "an anomalous variation of total energy with bond distance close to equilibrium seems likely to be due to deficiencies in the semi - empirical cpp description of the one - body core - valence interaction .",
    "this semi - empirical component is not present when the cpp is included .",
    "basis set convergence issues are particularly apparent for tic .",
    "experimental data are not available , and _ ab initio _ values in the literature@xcite range from @xmath124 @xmath117 . our ae , and pseudopotential , zpves deviate from this range significantly .",
    "this appears to be due to deficiencies in the basis sets used in previous calculations .",
    "we can reproduce the ae ccsd(t ) value of hack _ _ et al.__@xcite by employing the same contracted basis with only s , p , and d basis functions used by them , rather than the larger aug - cc - pvtz - dk basis set that we use .",
    "neither relativistic effects , nor uncontracting the basis sets , reproduce this disagreement .",
    "the experimental value of @xmath125 @xmath117 quoted by tomanari and tanaka@xcite also agrees well with our ae and cepp result , but the relevance of this value is unclear.@xcite    overall , the results for the 24 molecules in 27 states provide a useful test of the performance of our cepps .",
    "the choice of test set covers a modest , but important selection of atoms , and a variety of bonding types .",
    "given that previous assessments of the performance of the bfd and tndf pseudopotentials have been somewhat limited in the number of molecules considered , our test set may be considered as relatively demanding .",
    "the cepps do not introduce the non - linear core error of ks - dft pseudopotentials , and include core - valence electron correlation , so we may ascribe all errors to the transfer of scattering properties over a large energy range , with no contribution from an inadequate description of correlation effects in the pseudopotential itself .",
    "the results demonstrate the accuracy of cepps used together with an accurate description of electron correlation .    the choice of a small [ ne ] core pseudopotentials is expected to be important for an accurate description of the 3d - transition metal atoms , especially to the left of the row .",
    "results for our test set obtained using the large ( [ ar ] ) core tndf pseudopotentials are not given here , but support this expectation .",
    "they consistently show poor performance , with a mad for geometry parameters , @xmath72 , and zpve of @xmath126  , @xmath127 ev , and @xmath128 @xmath117 .",
    "these values are an order of magnitude worse than those for the [ ne ] core pseudopotentials , and far from chemical accuracy for both geometry parameters and dissociation energies .",
    "a strength of qmc methods is their suitability for the description of correlated electrons in bulk systems .",
    "such calculations often involve periodic ks - dft calculations with a plane wave basis , so it is desirable to validate the accuracy of cepps for this precursor to a qmc calculation .",
    "we investigate the convergence properties of the dissociation energies that arise from calculations of this type . here",
    "we consider a tio@xmath3 molecule in a @xmath129 a.u.@xmath130 cubic unit cell .",
    "the majority of plane wave ks - dft implementations express the pseudopotentials in terms of projectors centred on each nuclear site .",
    "this provides the pseudopotential operator in the kleinman - bylander ( kb ) representation@xcite , @xmath131 with @xmath132 .",
    "the @xmath133 functions used as part of each projector are supplied for each channel of each pseudopotential , and the matrices for each channel are given by @xmath134 .",
    "this separable form is less accurate than the semilocal spherical harmonic projector representation of eq .",
    "( [ semiloc ] ) , but the error is often small . the primary advantage of the kb representation is a considerable reduction in computational cost .    for ti and o we construct projectors using the numerical orbitals provided by atomic ks - dft calculations with cepps . for o",
    "we generate a single projector for each of the s and p channels from the @xmath135 ground state , with the d channel local .",
    "for ti we construct projectors using the 3s , 3p , 4s , and 3d orbitals present in the @xmath136 ground state .",
    "a further projector is obtained using the 4p orbital from the @xmath137 excited state , resulting in 5 projectors , with the f channel local . for ti , using two projectors for each of the s and p channels was judged to be desirable due to the significant contribution of the associated atomic orbitals to chemical bonding .",
    "the cepps , and projectors , were used in the castep@xcite code ( with a small modification to allow for more than one projector per pseudopotential channel ) for unit cells containing tio@xmath3 , ti , and o. sums and differences of the resulting three total energies provide the dissociation energy for the molecule .",
    "a pw91 exchange - correlation functional@xcite was used for both generating the projectors , and for the periodic calculations .",
    "the energy cutoff for the plane wave basis set is denoted @xmath138 , and the geometry for the tio@xmath3 molecule was obtained by total energy minimisation with the largest @xmath138 considered .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows the convergence behaviour for three ti cepps , each generated with a different value of @xmath9 chosen for the d channel .",
    "all three result in well behaved convergence behaviour for @xmath139 ev .",
    "results for @xmath140 a.u .  show the fastest convergence with @xmath138 , at the cost of poor transferability and a large offset error .",
    "results for @xmath141 a.u .  show the slowest convergence with @xmath138 .",
    "results for the cepp generated with @xmath142 a.u .",
    "provide the best compromise between convergence and transfer errors .",
    "a region within chemical accuracy of the ae ccsd(t ) value for @xmath72 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , which contains the ks - dft results for large @xmath138 and small @xmath9 . while this supports our conclusion that the kb representation is successful for this cepp , the very close agreement is probably fortuitous .",
    "the variation of such a dissociation energy with different exchange - correlation functionals is expected to be significantly larger than chemical accuracy , and there is no reason to expect the pw91 functional to perform particularly well for this molecule .",
    "we use @xmath142 a.u .  in what follows , which is the value referred to in subsection  [ implementation ] .",
    "values of @xmath9 for the s , p and f channels were obtained similarly .",
    "incorrect ` ghost ' ground states may arise for the separable form provided by the kb representation.@xcite transition metal pseudopotentials are particularly prone to this , due to their deep pseudopotentials , and hence we must check that the tio@xmath3 ground state is correct .",
    "we compare results that occur for a kb representation ( eq .  ( [ kb ] ) ) with those for a semilocal representation ( eq .  ( [ semiloc ] ) ) .    for the kb representation",
    ", results were obtained as above , using the plane - wave basis with @xmath143 ev . for the semilocal representation results",
    "were obtained using calculations equivalent to those in section  [ results ] , but with the ccsd(t ) method replaced by ks - dft . the aug - cc - pv5z basis set with no extrapolation",
    "was found to be sufficient for ks - dft .",
    "the pw91 exchange - correlation functional was used for both cepp representations .",
    "the total energies of the two cepp representations agree well .",
    "the kb and semilocal implementations provide total energies of @xmath144  a.u .  and @xmath145  a.u . respectively , strongly suggesting that ghost states have not occurred .",
    "results for relaxed geometries show a similar close agreement , with the kb representation providing a bond length and angle of @xmath146    and @xmath147 , and the semilocal representation providing values of @xmath148    and @xmath149 .",
    "we conclude that ghost states do not occur for this system , and it is reasonable to expect that they will not occur for the rest of the cepps provided .    ",
    "we have extended a previously presented scheme for generating pseudopotentials to the 3d - transition metals , and including the relativistic effects expected to be important for these atoms .",
    "these cepps are generated from explicitly correlated mchf calculations , and core polarizabilities , and include intra - core and core - valence correlation effects .",
    "we have generated such cepps for the atoms sc@xmath0fe .      we have compared results obtained using the cepps with a baseline of data for the same molecules and physical quantities , generated using ae calculations .",
    "this baseline ae data includes relativistic effects .",
    "we also compared performance with the tndf and bfd pseudopotentials that are widely used in the qmc community .",
    "the physical quantities compared are equilibrium geometries , dissociation energies , and harmonic zpves obtained .",
    "the dissociation energies show a significant improvement in accuracy compared with the two hf pseudopotentials , with mad and maximum deviations from the ae results for the 27 molecular states of : cepp ( @xmath108 and @xmath107 ev ) , bfd ( @xmath150 and @xmath151 ev ) , and tndf ( @xmath152 and @xmath153 ev ) . for the optimum geometries",
    "the cepps show a modest improvement over the bfd and tndf pseudopotentials , but the improved accuracy is enough to ensure that all predicted geometries fall within chemical accuracy of the ae results for the cepps only . for all molecules and pseudopotentials considered ,",
    "the agreement of zpves with ae values is well within chemical accuracy .",
    "the cepps are generated from highly ionised atoms , hence the results obtained for the moderately large set of neutral molecules provide convincing evidence that such cepps are highly transferable .",
    "the most demanding case is fe .",
    "we generate the fe cepp from a fe@xmath154 ion , and the resulting data for the feh , feo and fef molecules show an error that is not significantly greater than that for the rest of the test set , or than that for the first row molecules considered in a previous publication.@xcite    this very successful transfer of the cepps from ions to neutral systems suggests that the known poor transferability of norm - conserving ks - dft pseudopotentials between different ionic states arises from the approximate inversion of the kohn - sham equations used to construct them .",
    "such an inversion process is necessarily approximate since it employs a linearisation of the exchange - correlation functional , and the exact functional is not available .",
    "however , we do not conclude that our cepp generation procedure will necessarily be as successful for all atoms .",
    "although this may be the case , it must be tested atom by atom .",
    "furthermore , it may be argued that for the h@xmath0f and sc@xmath0fe molecules the core electrons replaced by the pseudopotential are more localised and tightly bound than for other atoms in the periodic table . whether this is significant remains an open question .",
    "we conclude that the cepps generated here perform well , and provide a consistent and significant improvement over the hf based pseudopotentials when used in correlated - electron calculations .",
