    "in the last decades the universe has been mapped by different methods sufficiently accurate to allow us global and detailed conclusions about its properties and behavior .",
    "key observations are the luminosity - redshift relationship of supernovae of type ia ( snia ) @xcite , the matter power spectrum of large scale structure as inferred from galaxy redshift surveys @xcite , and the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite .",
    "these observations allows us to conclude that the universe is spatially flat , and surprisingly its expansion is accelerating ( instead of the long thought slowing down ) .",
    "many different models have been proposed to explain this acceleration : for instance , large scale modifications of general relativity @xcite .",
    "the most popular explanation is , however , the inclusion of a dark energy component which corresponds to about @xmath1 of the total energy budget of the universe and has a quite negative pressure .",
    "candidates for the dark energy range from scalar fields @xcite ( which are widely used in cosmology @xcite ) , up to dark energy / dark matter unifying candidates , as for instance the chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "the simplest model , however , would still be a positive cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "understanding the nature of dark energy is one of the major objectives in cosmology nowadays .",
    "one way to undisclose its properties is to investigate its astrophysical and cosmological imprints .",
    "dark energy affects the formation of galaxies and clusters @xcite , as well as dark matter halo properties , such as the virial mass and the virial radius @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was also shown that @xmath0 affects the motion of test bodies in the schwarzschild - de sitter metric over large distances , a case of importance for large scale objects .",
    "although observables within the solar system seem not to be sensitive to the global expansion of the universe @xcite , that is not the case with large small - density astrophysical objects . in fact , investigations on the effects of dark energy in the local hubble flow show that those effects may not be negligible @xcite . in case of a cosmological constant , it has been shown that not only the formation of astrophysical bodies gets affected by @xmath0 , but also its static properties like the internal mean velocity and the angular velocity @xcite .",
    "in fact , it was shown in @xcite that @xmath0 may produce lower values of galaxy velocity dispersions .",
    "taken all these findings together one can state that dark energy has some effects at astrophysical scales .",
    "it is then important to try to understand what further possible effects could dark energy imprint on some of the properties of the astrophysical bodies .",
    "these signatures can be used to probe and test dark energy candidates .",
    "the effect of @xmath0 is bigger the more we deviate the object s geometry from the spherical case @xcite .",
    "this is important since by far not all structures found in the universe have spherical symmetry .",
    "rotating configurations acquire non spherical geometries which arise as solutions of the tensor virial theorem ( of second order ) . with zero cosmological constant some of these figures of",
    "equilibrium correspond to jacobi ellipsoid ( triaxial , rotating along the minor axis ) and maclaurin ellipsoid ( oblate , rotating along the minor axis ) .",
    "also one finds the dedekin ellipsoid , ( triaxial and flat because internal streaming ) , the riemann ellipsoid ( triaxial with rotation and internal motion ) , among other possible solutions .",
    "interestingly , not only galaxies have different morphologies @xcite , but also clusters of galaxies . of interest for us is especially the fact that clusters can have a prolate shape @xcite ( hence we expect that they can also appear in triaxial configurations ) and they can rotate @xcite .    in this article we will investigate some basic properties of ellipsoids in the presence of a cosmological constant . in particular",
    ", we will answer questions related to the geometry of a rotating configuration .",
    "for instance , given the axis of rotation , which could be any one of the three axis , what is the allowed range of the axis which emerges as a solution ?",
    "a legitimate question is also what are the changes regarding the bifurcation points ?",
    "in other words , at which point is a triaxial solution allowed .",
    "finally , we can ask what is the possible angular momentum ?",
    "although not frequently encountered , there are astrophysical objects rotating along the major axis ( this is the same to say that the objects rotates the minor axis ) @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to make some theoretical attempts to understand such exotic configurations .",
    "we will show that the triaxial case @xcite of minor axis rotation is possible with positive @xmath0 and the allowed region associated to values characterizing the geometrical configuration vanishes with vanishing @xmath0 . for oblate and prolate case",
    "we calculate the bifurcation points emphasizing the modifications and new effects induced by @xmath0 . clearly , the ellipsoidal geometry which we will study in the paper is well suited to model many geometries such as the disk .",
    "therefore , the results of this article should in principle be applicable also to superclusters which are usually found to be very flat objects @xcite .",
    "hereby we will concentrate on homogeneous rotating ellipsoids , whose equilibrium configuration will be explored by the tensor virial equation with @xmath0 @xcite describing the equilibrium properties of possible non - spherical configurations .",
    "the tensor virial theorem results into two equations : an equation for the angular velocity and one restricting possible geometries .",
    "it is therefore a perfect tool to study the subject .",
    "it is known that for spherical systems it is sufficient to work with the scalar virial theorem .",
    "our results generalize the ones obtained in @xcite .",
    "this is especially true for the bifurcation points of rotating ellipsoids as solutions of tensor virial equations for the oblate geometry .",
    "indeed , we follow closely the exposition and methods given in @xcite which applies for the case @xmath2 . however , the study of the prolate / triaxial case with minor axis rotation is new .",
    "it is not surprising after all that this has not been examined before as this case is only possible with @xmath3 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we review the basic expressions for describing equilibrium in the newtonian limit with a cosmological constant .",
    "since we retain in this limit @xmath0 , we are essentially dealing with a non - relativistic de sitter spacetime ( also called newton - hooke ) .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a brief discussion about the applicability of our approach to galaxy clusters . in section 4",
    "we explore the allowed configurations for a rotating ellipsoid whose rotation lies along the minor axis ( major axis rotation ) .",
    "the next section explores the strange scenario , which corresponds to the case of minor axis rotation , i.e. when the angular velocity is along the major axis .",
    "we end with conclusions .",
    "to explore the consequences of a positive cosmological constant , we make use of the newtonian limit of einstein field equations . in this limit , the poisson equation is written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the pressure , which arises as a general relativity correction .",
    "the solution of ( [ poisson ] ) at the zeroth order of @xmath6 ( from now on we set @xmath7 ) takes the form @xmath8 where we have neglected secondary effects of the cosmological constant in the set of the dirichlet boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the potential is then a contribution from a pure gravitational part @xmath9 and a contribution from the expansion proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "together with equation ( [ poisson ] ) , a self gravitating configuration is ruled by an equation of state and the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( euler s equation ) , which is written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the pressure tensor ( which for simplicity we take as isotropic @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 is the mean values of the velocity .",
    "the second order tensor virial equation can be derived by taking spatial moments in euler s equation .",
    "the result is an integral equation @xmath14 with @xmath15 which corresponds to the pressure integral , the kinetic energy tensor and the gravitational potential energy tensor , respectively .",
    "the moment of inertia tensor is defined as @xmath16    in statistical mechanics the virial theorem follows from taking time averages over a long period of time ( denoted below by @xmath17 ) such that the configuration reaches equilibrium .",
    "this implies that in equilibrium , the left hand side of ( [ virotro ] ) vanishes which gives us the tensor virial theorem as @xmath18 in astrophysics this would imply that we have to take an average over ensembles of observed objects of a specific type .",
    "this , in principle , is possible noting that the fact that the external contribution , i.e , the vacuum energy density @xmath19 is constant , and therefore the time average is only taken over proper parameters of the configuration .",
    "however , it is also customary and more convenient to assume that for most astrophysical objects the second derivative of the inertial tensor vanished at a sufficiently large time .",
    "the averaging is not necessary then . for generalizations ( dark energy , scalar fields or chaplygin gas ) ,",
    "where one has also to take into account the evolution of the background , this is a more straightforward approach . in the next sections , we drop the @xmath17 brackets and also use the convention @xmath20 .",
    "it is of some importance to this work to discuss briefly the question whether the virial theorem or hydrostatic equilibrium apply to large astrophysical structures .",
    "this is of importance for the present study because certainly the effect of @xmath0 will be seen only for relatively low density objects , i.e. clusters and superclusters .",
    "the other issues which are of phenomenological interest for us is the shape of these objects and their possible rotation .    whether one can apply the virial theorem ( or hydrostatic equilibrium ) and its consequences to groups or clusters of galaxies",
    "has been a matter of debate over years @xcite . in many cases",
    "( and these are the cases to which we can apply our subsequent results ) , this dispute has been decided in favour of the virial theorem @xcite .",
    "indeed , over decades the virial technique is the most widely used one @xcite and the agreement with other methods is satisfactory @xcite .",
    "the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in clusters is common and , as it seems , works well @xcite .",
    "there are exceptions due to cooling flows @xcite or misidentification of the cluster shape ( i.e. superposition of two apparent individual objects ) @xcite .",
    "last but not least , the virial theorem with cosmological constant has been successfully applied to galaxy clusters at early epochs @xcite .",
    "the morphology of clusters is as rich as the corresponding one for galaxies @xcite .",
    "almost all shapes can be fitted into ellipsoids @xcite .",
    "interestingly , virial results are used to take into account finite size effects of galaxy clusters in lensing @xcite .",
    "these effects are parameterized by ellipticity , a concept related to eccentricity of ellipsoids .",
    "the second important feature of clusters , mentioned already in the introduction , is that they can exhibit rotation @xcite exactly as galaxies do .",
    "the applicability of virial theorem to clusters taken together with the facts of their ellipsoidal nature and the established rotation means that we can apply our results below to galaxy clusters .",
    "it remains to address the question whether the application is valid for the luminous matter or the ` whole ' object including dark matter .",
    "we can rely here on studies and simulations which all , and this is the crucial observation here , indicate that dark matter halos around clusters are of ellipsoidal nature @xcite .",
    "however , we could apply the virial theorem to the luminous structure alone including for the total mass also the dark matter component .",
    "this seems possible as the form of the luminous matter does not change over cosmological times and hence can be assumed to be in equilibrium as a substructure . in any case , the morphology under discussion here will be ellipsoidal .    going from clusters to superclusters",
    "the following observation is worth noticing .",
    "clusters are often elongated within their group @xcite and aligned within their supercluster @xcite . this filamentary network @xcite ( .e.g . between the virgo and a1367 cluster @xcite ) could be a virialized substructure ( including the clusters themselves ) of the supercluster . indeed , distinction between virialized and non - virialized regions of a supercluster exits @xcite . in such a case",
    "these substructure would be best described by a prolate ellipsoid .",
    "if the angular momenta of the clusters are correlated @xcite we could have a model of rotating prolate / triaxial ellipsoid of clusters .",
    "finally , even though superclusters are , for different reasons , not believed to be in equilibrium @xcite , the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium still is often made in literature , either to test its grounds or to have a definite model @xcite . even in cases",
    "where hydrostatic equilibrium is shown to be not valid , the results form the virial theorem seem to be still useful @xcite when applied to superclusters . this conclusion is corroborated in @xcite .",
    "in this section we will consider the commonly known kind on ellipsoids configuration associated to cosmological and astrophysical systems , namely , oblate and triaxial configurations whose rotation is along the minor axis .",
    "certainly a great portion of the number of cosmological structures have a non spherical symmetry , which can be related to internal streaming or rotation .",
    "let us consider configurations with constant angular velocity along the minor axis .",
    "the kinetic energy tensor is then a contribution from internal motions and the rotating kinetic energy tensor , i.e. @xmath21 where @xmath22 is defined for constant angular velocity as @xmath23 in the following analysis , we will neglect internal motion .",
    "the tensor virial equation ( [ virotro ] ) for an homogeneous rotating configuration with angular velocity @xmath24 axis is then @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gravitational potential energy tensor and @xmath27 is the moment of inertia tensor . from this expression",
    "one can derive two relevant equations .",
    "in the first place , we find the equation for the angular velocity , given by @xmath28 which reduces to the standard maclaurin formula ( in the oblate case ) for homogeneous configurations putting @xmath29 . on the other hand , by eliminating @xmath30 from eq.([vt ] ) , we obtain a geometrical relation which restricts the geometry allowed for equilibrium configurations : @xmath31    for a triaxial ellipsoid with constant density @xmath32 and semi - axis @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 eq .",
    "( [ geom ] ) can be recast into the following form @xmath37 where @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the functions @xmath40 are defined in dependence of @xmath41 and @xmath42 as ( see @xcite ) @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the incomplete elliptic integrals @xmath46 with @xmath47 . equation ( [ geom ] )",
    "is a complicated equation whose solution is a function @xmath48 representing the allowed ratios for configurations in virial equilibrium with major axis rotation . in figure [ bif2 ]",
    "we plot these solutions with and without cosmological constant .",
    "note that the maclaurin ellipsoid ( @xmath49 ) is always a solution of ( [ geom ] ) , for any value of @xmath50 .",
    "jacobi ellipsoids ( triaxial case ) are allowed for values of @xmath50 below the bifurcation point @xmath51 . for @xmath2 , the bifurcation point",
    "is located at @xmath52 . on the other hand , with cosmological constant , we find the following relevant effects .",
    "first , the bifurcation point becomes a function of @xmath53 .",
    "as long as we increase the value of @xmath54 , the bifurcation point grows .",
    "this means that the separation between jacobi and maclaurin takes place at lower eccentricities .",
    "for instance , for @xmath55 we get @xmath56 .",
    "another interesting effect is that the range of allowed @xmath50 also changes .",
    "jacobi ellipsoids configurations are now restricted to @xmath57 . below @xmath58 ,",
    "the only allowed solution is again the maclaurin ellipsoid . for @xmath55 ,",
    "the minimum value of @xmath50 is @xmath59 .",
    "notice the value of @xmath54 is a time dependent quantity , which depends on the density , @xmath32 , of the astrophysical object we are investigating as well as on the value of @xmath60 . since we are interested in systems which have already reached an equilibrium configuration we consider @xmath54 as measured today .",
    "hence , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the background matter density .",
    "taking into account the classical result from the spherical collapse model in an einstein - de sitter universe , then @xmath63 .",
    "this gives @xmath64 .",
    "of course , this value may grow or decrease depending on the lower or higher density of the astrophysical system we are studying .",
    "in figure [ secbp ] we enlarged one plot for lower @xmath42 from figure 1 to explicitly show the second bifurcation point for @xmath65 . for @xmath66 ,",
    "the second bifurcation point is located at @xmath67 , while for smaller values of @xmath54 , @xmath58 goes to zero as expected . for practical purposes ,",
    "the behavior of the bifurcation point @xmath68 can be approximately described as a function of @xmath54 by a fit .",
    "we find in good approximation @xmath69 while the equilibrium condition can be fitted to be approximately @xmath70 where the factors @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( to be fitted ) take different values as a function of the ratio @xmath54 . in table",
    "[ fittable ] we summarize these values and our results on the bifurcation point of ellipsoids with major axis rotation.this bifurcation points separate triaxial solutions from oblate ones ( @xmath73 ) .    .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]       +    +    in figure [ ompr ] we plotted the angular velocity against @xmath42 .",
    "the bifurcation point , @xmath74 , is where the prolate curve intersects the corresponding triaxial case .",
    "@xmath75 is represented by the left vertical line beyond which we have no solution .",
    "it can be nicely seen that with decreasing @xmath54 the range of the triaxial solution becomes smaller until it vanishes for @xmath76 .",
    "the angular velocity is also not a smooth function as it was the case for the triaxial / oblate case .",
    "indeed , it oscillates ( allowing for the moment the physically excluded range of @xmath77 ) when approaching @xmath75 .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ ompr ] the restriction of positivity on @xmath78 narrows the allowed range of @xmath42 further .",
    "given the fact that without @xmath0 triaxial configurations with minor axis rotation are not in equilibrium , this narrow range is rather a virtue than a disadvantage if we want to put the theory to test .",
    "had we an accurate knowledge of a triaxial ellipsoidal cluster rotating the minor axis , the theory outlined above could be easily verified or falsified , of course bearing in mind the simplified assumptions of constant density / no internal motion ( as in @xcite ) and the fact that only projected information of the axis is available to us . from the observational side ,",
    "its encouraging to know that dark matter halos around galaxy clusters are described by triaxial configurations which tend to be more prolate @xcite .",
    "we have investigated effects of a positive cosmological constant on astrophysical objects with ellipsoidal geometries .",
    "we have considered both commonly known homogeneous ellipsoid configurations associated to cosmological and astrophysical systems , namely , oblate and triaxial configurations whose rotation is along the minor axis , as well as configurations with constant angular velocity along the minor axis . + we made use of the newtonian limit of the einstein field equations and have solved the tensor virial equation for the angular velocity . +",
    "our results generalize the ones obtained in @xcite which applies for the case @xmath2 .",
    "this is especially true for the bifurcation points of rotating ellipsoids as solutions of tensor virial equations for the oblate geometry . adding to that we have also investigated the prolate / triaxial case with minor axis rotation , which has not been examined before as this case is only possible with @xmath3 .",
    "+ we have found that the bifurcation point , which in the oblate case distinguishes the maclaurin ellipsoid ( oblate ) from the jacobi ellipsoid ( triaxial ) , is sensitive to the cosmological constant .",
    "a new effect is given by the appearance of @xmath75 which restricts the validity of the solutions from below .",
    "this point exists only for a positive cosmological constant .",
    "we also show that the cosmological constant allows triaxial configurations of equilibrium rotating along the minor axis as solutions of the virial equations .",
    "the significance of the result lies in the fact that minor axis rotation is indeed found in nature . being impossible for the oblate case",
    ", it is permissible for prolate geometries , with @xmath0 zero and positive .",
    "however , for the triaxial case an equilibrium solution for the minor axis rotation is found only for non - zero positive @xmath0 .",
    "therefore the latter case is intimately , albeit indirectly , related to the existence of a cosmological constant .",
    "the ellipsoidal geometry which we have studied in this paper is well suited to model many geometries , such as the disk .",
    "therefore , the results of this article should in principle be applicable also to superclusters which are usually found to be very flat objects @xcite .",

    "<S> the cosmological constant @xmath0 modifies certain properties of large astrophysical rotating configurations with ellipsoidal geometries , provided the objects are not too compact . assuming an equilibrium configuration and so using the tensor virial equation with @xmath0 we explore several equilibrium properties of homogeneous rotating ellipsoids . </S>",
    "<S> one shows that the bifurcation point , which in the oblate case distinguishes the maclaurin ellipsoid from the jacobi ellipsoid , is sensitive to the cosmological constant . adding to that , </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological constant allows triaxial configurations of equilibrium rotating the minor axis as solutions of the virial equations . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of the result lies in the fact that minor axis rotation is indeed found in nature . </S>",
    "<S> being impossible for the oblate case , it is permissible for prolate geometries , with @xmath0 zero and positive . for the triaxial case , </S>",
    "<S> however , an equilibrium solution is found only for non - zero positive @xmath0 . finally , we solve the tensor virial equation for the angular velocity and display special effects of the cosmological constant there . </S>"
