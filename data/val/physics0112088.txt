    "iv , possible extensions and applications of qed - dmft are discussed .",
    "conclusion with summary of this work is also presented .",
    "in this subsection , we introduce qed - dmft .",
    "first , we give a brief summary of qed .",
    "we start from the following lagrangian : @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is a ( virtual ) photon field which describes the interaction between fermions , and @xmath16 is a classical external field . @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the bare mass of fermion , @xmath19 is the dirac field , @xmath20 is its dirac conjugate .",
    "@xmath21 indicates time - space coordinate .",
    "the @xmath22-matrices are defined by ( under the standard representation ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the unit matrix , and @xmath25 ( i=1,2,3 ) is the pauli matrix : @xmath26 the hamiltonian for a qed system becomes @xmath27 where , @xmath16 is a classical field , while others are quantized .",
    "@xmath28 is a hamiltonian for electromagnetic field .",
    "if we descibe the interaction between fermions by using a photon propagator , we get @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is a full photon propagator .",
    "quantized fermion - field operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be expanded by one - particle state functions as @xmath33 where @xmath34 means the electron ( positron ) state , @xmath35 denotes quantum numbers for one - particle state , @xmath36 is electron creation ( annihilation ) operator , @xmath37 is positron creation ( annihilation ) operator , and @xmath38 is the four - component bispinor given like @xmath39 where , @xmath40 indicates the transposition of a matrix .",
    "after these preliminaries given above , we investigate the qed - dmft .",
    "for our aim , first we introduce the one - particle local density matrix : @xmath41 here @xmath2 and @xmath3 are usual dirac field , and they are 4-component bispinors .",
    "thus our density matrix is 4@xmath424 matrix , as denoted above .",
    "we can expand the 4@xmath424 density matrix into the 16-dimensional complete set of @xmath22-matrices : @xmath43 in this expansion , we take a convention as @xmath44 denotes the scalar , @xmath45 denotes the vector , @xmath40 denotes the 2-rank antisymmetric tensor , @xmath46 denotes the axial vector and @xmath47 denotes the pseudoscalar .",
    "@xmath24 is the @xmath0 unit - matrix , @xmath48 is usual dirac gamma matrix , @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50 $ ] , and @xmath51 .",
    "hence we obtain the lorentz structure in our density matrix @xmath52 .",
    "each component of the expansion in ( 12 ) is given as follows : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 includes a larger amount of informations than 4-current @xmath58 .",
    "it is clear from the discussion given above , if @xmath4 is given , then @xmath59 and also other components can be calculated .    the rayleigh - ritz variation principle of qed - dmft should be given rather straightforward extension of available theory , like the situation of the generalization of the hohenberg - kohn theorem to 4-current rdft  [ 7,14,18,25,26 ] .",
    "the exact energy functional of n - representable @xmath4 for ground state of a qed system ( strictly spearking , the particle number @xmath60 is not conserved in qed , but the total charge is conserved , as denoted in ( 15 ) . ) is given in the following form : @xmath61 & = & \\langle \\psi^{q}|\\hat{h}'|\\psi^{q}\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\           & = & f[q(x ) ] + \\int d^{3}x j^{\\mu}({\\bf x})a^{ext}_{\\mu}({\\bf x}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we use the hamiltonian @xmath62 given in ( 7 ) .",
    "now @xmath63 is a static external field .",
    "here we only consider a stationary problem .",
    "variational search of the minimum point of the functional should be performed under constraint : @xmath64 first equation is arised from the gauge invariance of the theory derived by nther theorem , while second one expresses the charge conservation .",
    "the fundamental theorems of dft proved by levy are constructed by two points  [ 14 ] : ( i ) the variation principle can be applied to the ground state energy functional @xmath65 $ ] or @xmath66 $ ] , where @xmath67 is the one - particle density while @xmath68 is the one - particle ( so called first - order ) density matrix .",
    "( ii ) the ground state of a system can be represented by @xmath67 or @xmath69 for ground state ( @xmath70 or @xmath71 ) .",
    "it is clear from his logic , the theorems do not distinguish between nonrelativistic case and relativistic case , and can be applied to relativistic case .",
    "therefore , we argue that our functional @xmath72 $ ] will obey the variation principle and @xmath4 for the ground state ( @xmath73 ) represents the ground state of a qed system .",
    "thus @xmath74 & = & \\min_{\\psi\\to q}\\langle\\psi|\\hat{t}+\\hat{v}_{f - f}|\\psi\\rangle , \\\\ e[q ] & = & \\min_{q}\\bigl\\{f[q]+\\int d^{3}x j^{\\mu}({\\bf x})a_{\\mu}({\\bf x})\\bigg|\\int d^{3}x j_{0}({\\bf x})=const .",

    ".    next step of our plan is the investigation into the kohn - sham scheme in our theory .",
    "the energy functional is devided into the following form : @xmath61 & = & t_{s}[q(x)]+\\int d^{3}x j^{\\mu}({\\bf x})a^{ext}_{\\mu}({\\bf x})+\\frac{1}{2}\\int d^{3}x \\int d^{3}x'\\frac{j^{\\mu}({\\bf x})j_{\\mu}({\\bf x}')}{|{\\bf x}-{\\bf x}'|}+e_{xc}[q(x ) ] .",

    "$ ] is the exchange - correlation energy functional in our theory .",
    "the definition of @xmath82 $ ] is given as @xmath83 & = & f[q(x)]-t_{s}[q(x)]-\\frac{1}{2}\\int d^{3}x \\int d^{3}x'\\frac{j^{\\mu}({\\bf x})j_{\\mu}({\\bf x}')}{|{\\bf x}-{\\bf x}'|}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the third term of the right hand side of ( 18 ) is a hartree - like term .",
    "this term arises if we replace @xmath30 of ( 7 ) to the 0-th order photon propagator of the feynman gauge : @xmath84 here @xmath85 is usual metric tensor and defined as @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the third term of ( 18 ) includes gauge parameter .",
    "@xmath87 has to include contributions to compensate the gauge dependence of the hartree - like term , for retaining the gauge invariance of the theory . from the variation with respect to the one - particle function",
    ", we obtain the dirac - kohn - sham equation in our theory : @xmath88}{\\delta q^{s}(x ) } = \\delta m + \\alpha({\\bf x } ) , \\\\ v^{v}_{\\mu}({\\bf x } ) = a^{ext}_{\\mu}({\\bf x})+\\int d^{3}x'\\frac{j_{\\mu}({\\bf x}')}{|{\\bf x}-{\\bf x}'|}+\\frac{\\delta e_{xc}[q(x)]}{\\delta q^{v}_{\\mu}(x ) } , \\\\ v^{t}_{\\mu\\nu}({\\bf x } ) = \\frac{\\delta e_{xc}[q(x)]}{\\delta q^{t}_{\\mu\\nu}(x ) } , \\\\ v^{a}_{\\mu}({\\bf x } ) = \\frac{\\delta e_{xc}[q(x)]}{\\delta q^{a}_{\\mu}(x ) } , \\\\ v^{p}({\\bf x } ) = \\frac{\\delta e_{xc}[q(x)]}{\\delta q^{p}(x)}.      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because our energy functional depends on the matrix @xmath4 , generally we obtain 16-component fictitious potentials . from the symmetry consideration ,",
    "it is clear that , scalar potential @xmath89 gives the mass correction @xmath90 , which will arises from radiative corrections .",
    "@xmath91 appears also in usual 4-current rdft  [ 7,26 ] .",
    "in fact , qed - dmft is a non - perturbative method in qed .",
    "it is a famous fact that , qed becomes finite if its calculation fulfills the requirement of the gauge invariance  [ 34 ] ( though we should employ gauge - invariant regularization and renormalization ) .",
    "therefore , if we can perform a calculation under retaining gauge invariance exactly , we will obtain a finite value for qed - dmft .",
    "now , we discuss the relation between various dft , as depicted in fig",
    "if we take into account only the components of 4-current @xmath92 in the expansion ( 12 ) of @xmath4 for qed - dmft energy functional , we obtain quantum electrodynamical current density functional theory ( qed - cdft )  [ 7,25,26 ] .",
    "next , under performing the gordon decomposition to spatial components of current @xmath93 ( here @xmath94 is the orbital current density while @xmath95 is the spin density ) , and then completely omit @xmath96 , we obtain relativistic spin density functional theory ( rsdft )  [ 25,28 ] .",
    "next , neglect the contribution of @xmath97 for rsdft , then we obtain relativistic density functional theory ( rdft ) . performing some nonrelativistic reduction ,",
    "especially only take into account the contribution of the large component to rdft , and neglect all relativistic corrections ( spin - orbit , darwin , mass - velocity etc . ) , then we obtain nonrelativistic density functional theory ( nrdft )  [ 5@xmath87 ] . generalizing the nrdft to spin polarized system , we get nonrelativistic spin density functional theory ( nrsdft )  [ 5@xmath87 ] .",
    "add the interaction between orbital current and external vector potential @xmath98 to nrsdft , we obtain nonrelativistic current density functional theory ( nrcdft )  [ 35 ] .",
    "extension of qed - dmft to the time - dependent region can also be considered .",
    "starting point here is the action integral for density functional , like the qed - tdhf  [ 31 ] : @xmath99 = \\int^{t_{f}}_{t_{i}}dt\\langle\\psi^{q}(t)|i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}-\\hat{h}'|\\psi^{q}(t)\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here matrix @xmath100 , depends on time @xmath101 .",

    "in fact , we simply assume that our functional of @xmath52 can be used to discuss variation principle parallel with their results .",
    "the time - dependent dirac - kohn - sham equation in our theory becomes @xmath105}{\\delta q^{s}(x ) } = \\delta m + \\alpha(x ) , \\\\",

    "now , all of them are time - dependent potentials .",
    "in this section , we give a discussion of group theoretical classification of the qed - dmft solutions .    in the relativistic theory",
    ", we usually treat the poincar group ( 4-translation and the lorentz group ) , charge conjugation , parity ( spatial inversion ) and time - reversal . under the charge conjugation , @xmath2 and @xmath3",

    ", together with the rule of taking the complex conjugate about c - numbers , we obtain @xmath111 where @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath113 is 0-th component of vector while @xmath114 is 0-th component of axial vector . @xmath115 and @xmath116 are space components of vector and axial vector , respectively . under the spatial inversion ,",
    "@xmath117 @xmath4 is transformed as @xmath118    the qed - dmft solutions can be group theoretically classified into several types . to consider this problem , we determine the symmetry group of a system . in the atomic or molecular systems ,",
    "the translation invariance is broken . in the case of an atom ,",
    "only @xmath5 rotation remains in the lorentz group ( in the case of a molecule , @xmath5 is replaced by the point group . ) . under the @xmath5 rotational symmetry ,",
    "we expand the @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 by the scalar spherical harmonics , while we expand the @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath121 by the vector spherical harmonics  [ 36 ] .",
    "it is clear from ( 41 ) and ( 43 ) , the behavior of each type of the density matrix given in ( 12 ) under the spatial inversion and time reversal depends not only on the structure of the @xmath22-matrix , but also on the angular momentum of the spherical harmonics .",
    "let us consider the case of an atom .",
    "we treat the group @xmath122 .",
    "we introduce the subgroup of @xmath123 as @xmath124 for example , @xmath125-invariant solution is given as @xmath126 there is no case for @xmath127-invariant solution .",
    "@xmath128-invariant solution is given as @xmath129 @xmath5-invariant solution is given as @xmath130 due to the @xmath5 rotational invariance , each density matrix can only have an s - wave component in all cases ( 45)@xmath8(47 ) .",
    "all solutions given above are the cases for closed shell states .",
    "we may have magnetic qed - dmft solutions for systems under discussions , if time reversal symmetry is broken ( for example , the case of ( 47 ) ) .    under the presence of the vectorial density matrices like the @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath121 , the @xmath5 rotational symmetry will be broken .",
    "for @xmath131- , @xmath47- , @xmath40- and @xmath132- ( no symmetry ) invariant solutions , simple classification is impossible , because there are various possibilities of the angular momentum dependences of @xmath52 .",
    "this situation demands us futher investigation in more detail in the future .",
    "it must be noted that we have to solve the dirac - kohn - sham equation to find which type of the density matrices ( and solutions ) will be realized .      to consider the nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits , we take the standard representation .",
    "the four component bispinor @xmath2 is partitioned as  [ 36 ] @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the large component and @xmath135 is the small component .",
    "then we obtain @xmath136 here , @xmath137 denotes vector - like components of @xmath121 , while @xmath138 denotes axial - vector - like components of @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , at the nonrelativistic limit ( @xmath135 will vanish ) , the @xmath119 and @xmath113 coincide with each other and they give @xmath139 , while the @xmath138 gives @xmath140 and the @xmath116 gives @xmath141 .",
    "the @xmath115 , @xmath137 , @xmath114 and @xmath120 vanish at the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "@xmath142 corresponds to the usual density of nonrelativistic theory , while @xmath143 corresponds to the spin density of nonrelativistic theory .",
    "futhermore , at the ultrarelativistic limit ( @xmath134 and @xmath135 coincide with each other ) , @xmath113 , @xmath115 , @xmath114 and @xmath116 remain while others vanish .",
    "therefore , for a system under strong relativistic effects , @xmath144 and @xmath145 may give important contributions to qed - dmft solutions .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the qed - dmft and the group theoretical classification of its solutions .",
    "we have introduced the one - particle local density matrix @xmath4 , and have decomposed by using @xmath22-matrices .",
    "we have discussed the transformation properties of the matrix under group operations , and its nonrelativistic limit .      in the context of the electronic structure of atoms ,",
    "there are three effects : the electron correlation , the relativistic effect and the qed effect .",
    "the electronic structure of atoms is determined by the relation of these three factors .",
    "the electron correlation depends on the electron numbers and can be treated by several many - body techniques . the relativistic effect ( kinematic effect , spin - orbit , darwin , mass - velocity , etc . )",
    "becomes large with increasing the atomic number . on the other hand ,",
    "the case to describe the inner core electrons of heavy elements or , electrons of highly ionized heavy elements such as lithium - like uranium , the qed effect ( mainly originate in negative energy state ) can not be neglected and we must take the dirac sea into account . in the case of heavy atoms , as the ionicity becomes high and the electron number decrease , the many - body effect becomes small and the qed effect becomes large . in principle , qed - dmft can exactly estimate the three effects discussed above .",
    "therefore we propose that qed - dmft should be applied to the cases where both the many - body effects and the qed effects can not be neglected . practically , we need a well - behaved exchange - correlation functional which contains both the correlation energy and qed effect satisfactorily . heavy elements in middle level of ionicity should be one of the subject for our theory . the calculation of electromagnetic properties , for example , g - factors , hyperfine interactions , nuclear magnetic resonance shielding constants , are interesting .",
    "the collision of two uranium atoms is also one of the interesting subject of qed - tddmft .",
    "qed - tddmft should be useful to describe excitations , susceptibilities and collective modes of systems .",
    "recently , experiments of x - ray irradiation to cluster plasma are performed , and verious new phenomena were studied  [ 37 ] .",
    "the cluster of heavy ions under middle revel of ionicity is now an interesting subject in this area .",
    "the importance of the relativistic and qed effects is discussed in such objects .",
    "it is a famous fact that , the available exchange - correlation functionals only describe the dynamic correlations reliably , and they fails for systems with strong static correlations .",
    "thus , usual kohn - sham scheme often breaks down in the case of near degenerate ground states . in the usual method of quantum chemistry",
    ", the static correlation should be described by using multi - determinantal wavefunctions .",
    "the casscf is one of the methods to take into account the static correlation effect correctly .",
    "recently , the cas - dft method was proposed  [ 38 ] . in this method ,",
    "the dynamic correlation is considered by usual dft scheme , while static correlation is handled by cas - type wavefunction .",
    "the energy functional is given as @xmath146 & = & \\min_{\\rho\\to n}\\bigl\\ { f[\\rho]+\\int d^{3}x\\rho({\\bf x})v({\\bf x})\\bigr\\ } , \\\\",

    "@xmath148 is a cas trial wavefunction . in the scheme given above",
    ", exchange energy and static correlation energy are covered by @xmath149 , while @xmath150 includes the dynamic correlation energy only .",
    "cas - dft in nonrelativistic case gives accurate results  [ 38 ] .",
    "thus we propose that this method can be extended to the relativistic theory , and should become usuful tool to consider near degeneracy effect in relativistic dft framework .",
    "for this aim , we introduce the density matrix which is defined as @xmath151 then we diagonalize the density matrix , we obtain the natural orbital given by four - component bispinor @xmath152 and @xmath153 as its occupation number . by using the occupation number @xmath153 , we can select the active space for treatments of the near degeneracy effects  [ 39 ] . the natural orbital analysis of a resulted solution",
    "is useful to elucidate the type and magnitude of broken symmetry .",
    "it is also interesting for us to use the information entropy to measure the electron correlation in various systems  [ 40 ] .",
    "for example ,",
    "shannon entropy @xmath154 or jaynes entropy",
    "@xmath155 might be useful tools .",
    "the electron correlation energy can be estimated based on the collins s conjecture : @xmath156 therefore , by using these entropies , we propose to estimate the strength of the electron correlation in various atoms under various ionicities with qed - dmft .",

    "<S> for studying the group theoretical classification of the solutions of the density functional theory in relativistic framework , we propose quantum electrodynamical density - matrix functional theory ( qed - dmft ) . </S>",
    "<S> qed - dmft gives the energy as a functional of a local one - body @xmath0 matrix @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are 4-component dirac field and its dirac conjugate , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we examine some characters of qed - dmft . after these preparations , by using @xmath4 , we classify the solutions of qed - dmft under @xmath5 rotation , time reversal and spatial inversion . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of @xmath4 under nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits are also presented . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we give plans for several extensions and applications of qed - dmft .    </S>",
