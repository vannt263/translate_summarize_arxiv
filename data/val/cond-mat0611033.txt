    "mostly due to the enormous practical importance of glassy systems there has been a vast literature describing different theoretical frameworks for glasses , yet without a common theory applicable to the diverse range of systems undergoing a glass transition .",
    "increasing the volume fraction of a colloidal system slows down the brownian dynamics of its constitutive particles , implying a limiting density , @xmath0 , above which the system can no longer be equilibrated with its bath @xcite .",
    "hence , the thermal system falls out of equilibrium on the time scale of the experiment and thus undergoes a _ glass transition _ @xcite .",
    "even above @xmath0 the particles continue to relax , but the nature of the relaxation is very different to that in equilibrium .",
    "this phenomenon of a structural slow evolution beyond the glassy state is known as `` aging '' @xcite .",
    "the system is no longer stationary and the relaxation time is found to increase with the age of the system , @xmath1 , as measured from the time of sample preparation .",
    "this picture applies not only to structural glasses such as colloids , silica and polymer melts , but also to spin - glasses , ferromagnetic coarsening , elastic manifolds in quenched disorder and jammed matter such as grains and emulsions @xcite .    in order to investigate the dynamical properties of the aging regime we consider the evolution of the correlation function @xmath2 and integrated response to external fields @xmath3 .",
    "these quantities are separated into a stationary ( short time ) and an aging part ( long time ) : @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where we have included the explicit dependence on @xmath1 in the aging part , and @xmath6 is the observation time .",
    "we use a simple system undergoing a glass transition : a colloidal glass of micrometer size particles , where the interactions between particles can be approximated as hard core potentials @xcite .",
    "the system is index matched to allow the visualization of tracer particles in the microscope @xcite .",
    "owing to the simplicity of the system , we are able to follow the trajectories of magnetic tracers embedded in the colloidal sample and use this information to understand the scaling of the local and global fluctuations of the correlation functions .",
    "our experiments use a colloidal suspension consisting of a mixture of poly-(methylmethacrylate ) ( pmma ) sterically stabilized colloidal particles ( radius @xmath7 , density @xmath8 , polydispersity @xmath9 ) plus a small fraction of superparamagnetic beads ( radius @xmath10 and density @xmath11 , from dynal biotech inc . ) as the tracers    the colloidal suspension is immersed in a solution containing @xmath12 weight fraction of cyclohexylbromide and @xmath13 cis - decalin which are chosen for their density and index of refraction matching capabilities @xcite .",
    "for such a system the glass transition occurs at @xmath14 @xcite . in our experiments we consider two samples at different densities and determine the glassy phase for the samples that display aging .",
    "the main results are obtained for sample a just above the glass transition @xmath15 .",
    "we also consider a denser sample b with @xmath16 , although this sample is so deep in the glassy phase that we are not able to study the slow relaxation of the system and the dependence of the waiting time within the time scales of our experiments .",
    "we use a magnetic force as the external perturbation to generate two - dimensional motion of the tracers @xcite on a microscope stage following a simplified design of @xcite .",
    "video microscopy and computerized image analysis are used to locate the tracers in each image .",
    "we calculate the response and correlation functions in the x - y plane .",
    "the experimental set up is shown in fig .",
    "[ images]a and fig .",
    "[ images]b .",
    "we use a zeiss microscope with a 50@xmath17 objective of numerical aperture 0.5 and a working distance of 5 mm .",
    "we work with a field of view @xmath18 by using a digital camera with the resolution of 1288 pixels @xmath17 1032 pixels .",
    "we locate the center of each bead position with sub - pixel accuracy , by using image analysis . for the condensed samples",
    "a and b , we use the low frame rate @xmath19 frame / sec , while for the dilute sample c , we record the images at @xmath20 frame / sec .",
    "the long working distance of the objective is necessary to allow the pole of the magnet to reach a position near the sample .",
    "an example of the images of the tracers obtained in sample a is shown in fig .",
    "[ images]c where we can see the black magnetic tracers embedded in the background of nearly transparent pmma particles .",
    "an example of the trajectory in the x - y plane of a tracer diffusing without magnetic field is shown in fig .",
    "[ images]d .",
    "we note that this particular tracer moves away from two cages in a time of the order of @xmath21 hours .",
    "the magnetic field is produced by one coil made of 1200 turns of copper wire .",
    "we arrange the pole of the coil perpendicular to the vertical optical axis , and generate a field with no vertical component .",
    "thus , the tracers move in the x - y plane with a slight vertical motion which is generated by a density mismatch between the tracers and the background pmma particles .",
    "this vertical motion is very small at the high volume fraction of interest here , and therefore we calculate all the observables in the x - y plane .",
    "the magnetic force is calibrated for a given coil current by replacing the suspension with a mixture of @xmath22 water - glycerol solution with a few magnetic tracers .",
    "the distance between the top of the magnetic pole and the vertical optical axis is always fixed , which means that the magnetic force at the local plane depends only on the coil current . at a given current , we determine the velocity of the magnetic tracers at the focal point and calculate the magnetic force from stokes s law , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the viscosity of the water - glycerol solution , @xmath25 is the tracer radius , and @xmath26 is the observed velocity of the tracer .",
    "the uncertainty in the obtained force comes from : ( a ) the uncertainty in the coil current which is @xmath27 , ( b ) the beads , which are not completely monodisperse in their magnetic properties , causes a @xmath28 uncertainty @xcite , and ( c ) the magnetic field is slowly decaying in the field of view , causing a @xmath29 uncertainty .    in order to investigate the dynamical properties of the aging regime , we first consider the autocorrelation function as the mean square displacement ( msd ) averaged over 82 tracer particles , @xmath30 ^ 2\\rangle/2 $ ] , at a given observation time , @xmath31 , after the sample has been aging for @xmath1 as measured from the end of the stirring process . then , we measure the integrated response function ( by adding the external magnetic force , @xmath32 ) given by the average position of the tracers , @xmath33 .",
    "it is important to correctly determine the initial time of each measurement to reproduce the subsequent particle dynamics .",
    "we initialize the system by stirring the sample for two hours with an air bubble inside the sample ( see fig . [",
    "images]b ) to homogenize the whole system and break up any pre - existing crystalline regions .",
    "then we place the sample on the magnetic stage and take images to obtain the trajectories of the tracers that appear in the field of view .",
    "the initial times @xmath35 are defined at the end of the stirring . after measuring all the tracers appearing in the field of view , a new stirring",
    "is applied , the waiting time is reset to zero , and the measurements are repeated for a new set of tracers .",
    "we have analyzed the pair - distribution function , @xmath36 , and two - time intensity autocorrelation function , @xmath37 , in order to test our rejuvenation technique .",
    "first , fig .",
    "[ gr ] plots the pair - distribution functions of sample a and sample b right after the stirring procedure .",
    "we calculate the pair - distribution functions by reconstructing the packings from 3d confocal microscopy images of size @xmath38 .",
    "we find that the samples do not show obvious crystallized region by directly looking either at the pair - distribution function or the images taken from confocal microscopy .    for these measurements we use a leica confocal microscope .",
    "the pmma particles are fluorescently dyed so that they are ready to be observed by confocal microscopy .",
    "we load the samples sealed in a glass cell on the confocal microscope stage and use a leica hcx pl apo 63x , 1.40 numerical aperture , oil immersion lens for 3d particle visualization in order to calculate the volume fraction and the pair - distribution function .",
    "second , we analyze @xmath39 and show that the sample has been rejuvenated by the stirring process .",
    "we plot @xmath39 for 3 situations : ( a ) after the first stirring process ( @xmath34 ) , ( b ) after the sample has aged for a long time ( @xmath40 ) , ( c ) we then apply the stirring again and immediately plot the autocorrelation function for the new initial time ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the plot show the lack of correlation for the two individual measurements @xmath34 and @xmath41 , thus demonstrating that the sample has been rejuvenated .",
    "technically , we record the temporal image sequence of sample a and sample b , and study the aging by calculating two images correlation defined as :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the average gray - scale intensity of a small box ( 20 pixels @xmath17 20 pixels , pmma particles diameter is roughly equal to 20 pixels ) , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 come from the images at different times @xmath1 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "we cut one image ( 1288 pixels @xmath17 1032 pixels ) into many boxes , and calculate the correlation of two boxes located at the same position in the two images .",
    "the average @xmath46 is taken over all the boxes in one image .",
    "[ g2 ] plots the correlation function , @xmath37 , of sample a and sample b , which shows aging behavior ( see the inset ) .",
    "[ g2 ] shows how @xmath37 calculated after two stirring processes at @xmath34 and @xmath41 coincide , indicating that the sample can be fully rejuvenated to its initial state by our stirring technique .",
    "insight into the understanding of the slow relaxation can be obtained from the study of the universal dynamic scaling of the observables with @xmath1 .",
    "based on spin - glass models , different scaling scenarios have been proposed @xcite for correlation and response functions .",
    "our analysis indicates that the observables can be described as    @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are two universal functions and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the aging exponents .",
    "evidence for the validity of these scaling laws is provided in fig . [ scaling ] where the data of the correlation function and the integrated response function collapse onto a master curve when plotted as @xmath52 and @xmath53 versus @xmath54 . by minimizing the @xmath55 value of the difference between the master curve and the data we find that the best data collapse is obtained for the following aging exponents : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we find ( fig . [ scaling ] ) that the scaling functions satisfy the following asymptotic behavior : @xmath58 in agreement with the fact that the motion of the particles is diffusive at long times , @xmath59 , and the existence of a well - defined mobility , respectively .",
    "therefore at long times , both the correlation and response functions display the same power law decay : @xmath60    the result @xmath61 indicates @xmath62 . for short times , the msd scaling function crosses over to a sub - diffusive behavior of the particles .",
    "we obtain , @xmath63 .",
    "since the trapping time corresponds to the size of the cages denoted by @xmath64 , we can determine the cage dependence on @xmath1 as @xmath65 .",
    "the resulting exponent is so small that we can say that the cages are not evolving with the waiting time , within experimental uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , the scaling ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ scaling - laws ] ) indicates that the relaxation time of the cages scales as @xmath66 since this is the time when the sub - diffusive behavior crosses - over to the long time diffusive regime .",
    "we find that the scaling forms of the correlations and responses are not consistent with p - spin models .",
    "based on invariance properties under time reparametrization , spin - glass models predict a general scaling form @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a generic monotonic function @xcite .",
    "we find that the scaling of our observables can not be collapsed with the ratio @xmath69 .",
    "the scaling with @xmath69 is expected for system in which the correlation function saturates at long times @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our system is diffusive , and the studied correlation function is not bounded . indeed ,",
    "similar scaling as in our system has been found in the aging dynamics of anther unbounded system : an elastic manifold in a disordered media @xcite .",
    "the suggestion is that this problem and the particle diffusing in a colloidal glass may belong to the same universality class .",
    "furthermore our results can be interpreted in terms of the droplet picture of the aging of spin glass , where the growth of the dynamical heterogeneities control the aging .",
    "previous work has revealed the existence of dynamical heterogeneities , associated with the cooperative motion of the particles , as a precursor to the glass transition as well as in the glassy state @xcite . instead of the average global quantities studied above , the existence of dynamical heterogeneities requires a microscopic insight into the structure of the glassy .",
    "earlier studies focused mainly on probability distributions of the particles displacement near the glass transition .",
    "more recent analytical work in spin glasses @xcite shows that the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the local correlation @xmath70 and the local integrated response @xmath71 could reveal essential features of the dynamical heterogeneities .",
    "here we perform a systematic study of @xmath70 and @xmath71 in sample a , and the resulting pdfs are shown in fig .",
    "the scaling ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ scaling - laws ] ) implies that @xmath70 and @xmath71 should be collapsed by rescaling the time @xmath72 by @xmath73 and the local fluctuations by @xmath74 .",
    "indeed , this scaling ansatz provides the correct collapse of all the local fluctuations captured by the pdfs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ pdf]a , [ pdf]b and [ pdf]c for @xmath70 and in fig .",
    "[ pdf]d for @xmath71 .",
    "the pdf of the autocorrelation function displays a universal behavior following a modified power - law    @xmath75    where @xmath76 and @xmath77 only depend on the time ratio @xmath78 . for the smaller values of @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) ,",
    "the existence of a flat plateau in @xmath70 indicates that the tracers are confined in the cage . for larger values of @xmath79 ,",
    "the salient feature of the pdf is the very broad character of the distribution , with an asymptotic behavior @xmath81 .",
    "this large deviation from a gaussian behavior is a clear indication of the heterogeneous character of the dynamics .",
    "furthermore , the exponent @xmath77 decreases from 2.6 to 1.4 with the time ratio @xmath82 ranging from 10 to 60 .",
    "we notice that @xmath83 corresponds to the crossover between the short - time and long - time regime in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] , where @xmath84 . the significance of @xmath85 is seen in the integral @xmath86 . for @xmath87 ( @xmath88 )",
    "the plateau dominates over the power law tail in the integral and the dynamics is less heterogeneous . for @xmath89 ( @xmath90 )",
    "the power law tail dominates and this regime corresponds to the highly heterogeneous long - time regime .    on the contrary , @xmath71 , shown in fig .",
    "[ pdf]d , displays a different behavior .",
    "the fluctuations are more narrow and the pdf can be approximated by a gaussian .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that we did not find cage dynamics for the global response .",
    "moreover , numerical simulations of spin - glass models @xcite seem to indicate a narrower distribution as found here .",
    "the local correlation function @xmath79 and local integrated response function @xmath91 studied here are calculated from each individual tracer trajectory . in a condensed colloidal sample ,",
    "the tracer trajectories are always confined at a local position .",
    "therefore , the correlation @xmath79 and response @xmath91 for an individual particle can be regarded as the coarse - grained _ local _ fluctuations of the observables as investigated in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in order to improve the statistics of our results , the pdf @xmath70 is calculated not only for all the tracers , but also over a time interval much smaller than the age of the system . in practice",

    "similar technique is performed to calculate @xmath71 .",
    "next we derive the scaling law for the pdf of the local correlation function .",
    "let us first recall the scaling behavior of the global correlation function in eq .",
    "( [ scaling - laws ] ) ,    @xmath98    where we add a bar to @xmath99 to distinguish the global correlations from the local @xmath79 . the average is taken over all the tracer particles .",
    "we can rewrite the global correlation function as the integration of the pdf @xmath70 as :    @xmath100    furthermore , we obtain the relation of @xmath101 and @xmath70 by substituting eq .",

    "following the previous discussion of @xmath70 , we define the @xmath122-th tracer s local correlation function as :    @xmath123    where the average @xmath124 is calculated for only the @xmath122-th tracer s trajectory by opening a small time window @xmath94 $ ] ( @xmath125 ) at a given @xmath72 , and counting all the @xmath96 with @xmath97 $ ] into the statistics of @xmath70 .",
    "we should note that if there is no average @xmath126 , @xmath70 can be reduced to a simple form :    @xmath127    this form can be further reduced since @xmath128 therefore at the limit of the average @xmath129 , @xmath130    therefore our @xmath70 is related to the probability @xmath131 usually studied in previous works @xcite .",
    "the reader with enough endurance to have reached this point in the paper may realize the apparent contradiction between our power - law scaling and the typical stretched exponential behaviour found in other studies of local fluctuations . in",
    "this regard we may first say that previous work considered the supercooled regime while we work in the glassy regime . thus , both regimes may show different type of scaling .",
    "when we analyze the scaling of @xmath131 in our glassy system we find that it can be approximately fitted by both a broad tail power law behavior for large @xmath132 , consistent with equation [ mpl ] , but also by a stretched exponential , which is consistent with previous works @xcite for the supercooled regime . on the hand @xmath133",
