    "the analysis of networks in financial markets has received a growing attention in recent years @xcite . however , most studies to date have focused on closed systems , such as inter - bank markets @xcite , ownership networks @xcite or networks of directors @xcite .",
    "recently network analysis has been applied to cross - border portfolio investment flows showing that network measurements can be used as indicators of structural robustness of financial systems @xcite .",
    "research has also been further developed to couple financial networks with real economic networks ( cross - border trades , or , the international trading network ) into an all - inclusive approach @xcite .",
    "departing from this latter line of research , the present analysis aims to develop a comparative analysis of the international financial system with the environmental loads carried by goods in the international trade network(itn ) within oecd countries .    setting off from this latter line of research",
    ", the present analysis aims to develop a comparative analysis of the international financial system in conjunction with environmental loads carried by goods in the itn within oecd countries .",
    "the research conducted in this paper relates to two main strands of the literature : the debate on the interactions between financial and bilateral trade flows @xcite and that of the nexus between environmental and investment flows , such as foreign direct investment ( fdi)@xcite .",
    "our analysis concentrates on correlation and reciprocity structure of relations between finance and the environmental content of trades .",
    "the existence of reciprocal interaction between financial flows ( particularly long term ones , such as fdi ) and trade between countries is well established in the literature@xcite . according to the model proposed by coeurdacier @xcite , trade openness ,",
    "namely the exposure of domestic firms to increasing international competition , might foster the acquisition of foreign firms equities as a hedging strategy .",
    "consequently , bilateral equity holdings and commercial imports are expected to be positively correlated .",
    "trade relations could also lead to a reduction in borrowing costs which , in turn , stimulates investments .",
    "information asymmetries might provide another explanation : transactions in international trade facilitate information flows between trading partners which , in turn , lowers uncertainties for international financial transactions and vice versa @xcite .",
    "a growing body of empirical evidence corroborates the hypothesis of the complementarity between trade and fdi @xcite .",
    "the empirical literature has also investigated the correlation between trade and portfolio investments .",
    "aviat and coeurdacie @xcite , exploring the geography of trade in goods and asset holdings , for instance , find that the causality between bilateral asset holdings and commercial trade strongly progresses in both ways .",
    "lane and milesi - ferretti @xcite , using data on international portfolio positions , show that there is a strong correlation between bilateral equity holdings and bilateral trade in goods and services , however the question should be asked if this connection between trade and financial flows has environmental implications and whether highly financialised countries have incentives to re - allocate industrial production to less developed countries to reduce their domestic pollution .",
    "recent contributions on the `` pollution haven effect '' suggest that stringency of environmental regulation affects country competitiveness reducing net exports , increasing net imports and affecting firms location choice , and consequently fdi .",
    "additionally analyses by aichele and felbermayr @xcite reveal that the kyoto protocol affects trade flows by significantly increasing committed countries embodied carbon imports from non - committed countries and the emission intensity of their imports .",
    "less attention is paid to the role for portfolio investment as a channel for high financialised countries to re - allocate the industrial production into other countries to reduce their domestic pollution . in our paper",
    ", we investigate not only the link between fdi and trade of goods but also the correlation between other financial flows , such as equity and bond securities , which are characterized by a shorter time horizon than fdis .",
    "the research question we want to address is : what role do the long and short term financial flows plays with respect to the direction and intensity of international trade and their expected environmental impact , in terms of different pollution variables ?",
    "we find that embodied environmental content of imports have , on average , stronger and more stable correlation and reciprocity with financial outflows , either as fdi and cross - borders portfolio flows , than with inward financial flows .",
    "moreover , this pattern is more accentuated for highly financialised countries .",
    "in particular , in the multiplex network of cross - border financial investments and of environmental flows embodied in trade movements , four ( france , germany , usa and uk ) out of five hubs are net importers of environmental load .",
    "these results can not definitively detect a causal link but are consistent with the notion that financial markets help the most financialised countries export capitals in exchange of environment load s displacement .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present the used data sources and data content and we briefly present the indexes of correlation and reciprocity calculated in the analysis .",
    "then , we discuss the main results and their economic implications . the last section concludes .",
    "supplementary materials and all details of the analyses are reported in the sm .",
    "our network analysis combines various data sources for measures of trade and bilateral financial flows and positions between oecd countries over the 2002 - 2010 period .",
    "more precisely , we consider ten networks where nodes are given by 33 oecd countries and where edges are represented by aggregated / effective cross - border flows of financial investments or goods ( see the si for a detailed list of nodes and flows ) .",
    "financial flows comprise bilateral foreign direct investment flows ( fdi ) and portfolio capital flows .",
    "fdi data are reported in current usd millions and come from oecd statistics .",
    "portfolio flows are also measured in current usd millions and data are drawn from the coordinated portfolio investment survey ( cpis ) carried out by imf @xcite .",
    "the cpis records data on the bilateral composition of year - end portfolio holdings ( long - term debt , short - term debt and equity portfolio assets ) for over seventy reporting / source countries _ vis - a - vis _ over 200 destination countries , however it does not provide information on portfolio flows .",
    "for this reason , all portfolio flows in this paper are measured as the difference between consecutive positions : an increase ( decrease ) in debt securities issued by country @xmath5 and held by residents in country @xmath6 is recorded as a capital movement from country j to country @xmath6 ( from @xmath6 to @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "earlier studies @xcite have already underscored the main limitations of the cpis in terms of incompleteness , lack of strong data consistence , risk of under - reporting and problematic treatment of intermediated holdings in financial centers",
    ". however , the inclusion of portfolio flows , in addition to fdi , allows us to track trends and features of financial investment decisions that are based on different time - horizons and driven by different economic motives .",
    "moreover , we try to contain some of these problems by focusing the analysis on oecd countries which are more likely to report comprehensive information .",
    "we therefore select a set of countries which are expected to ensure the best _ trade - off _ between data quality and geographical and time coverage .",
    "this , however , implies that the interpretation of our results should take into account that large players , such as china , and important resource - rich countries , such as the gulf states , are excluded from the analysis . as for trade networks , we concentrate on environmental flows which are , directly and indirectly , generated by trade flows .",
    "the estimation of the environmental footprint of trade flows draws from the eora global multi - region , input output ( mrio ) database @xcite .",
    "eora elaborates a time series of environmentally extended input - output ( io ) tables for 187 countries based on the un system of national accounts ( sna ) , un comtrade , eurostat , ide / jetro , and several national io tables with matching environmental and social satellite accounts .",
    "we refer to this database to obtain footprint embodied in bilateral import and export flows in terms of five environmental dimensions : emissions of @xmath7 @xmath0 ( in gigagrams , gg ) , @xmath8 @xmath1 ( gg ) , @xmath9 @xmath2(gg ) , @xmath10 total @xmath3 @xmath4 emissions ( gg ) @xmath11 and water footprint ( in m3 ) .",
    "the five financial networks analysed in this study comprise the networks of bilateral fdi , portfolio investments in short and long term security debt ( sd and ld ) , in equities as well as in total security debts ( sd+ld ) .. environmental and financial networks share the same set of nodes , namely the 33 oecd countries .",
    "the entanglement of their relationships gives rise to a _",
    "multiplex _ of interacting networks @xcite .",
    "henceforth , every network will be defined as a _ layer _ of this financial - environmental multiplex .    to start with",
    ", we investigate the _ spatial _ correlation among layers by applying a previous method based on the pearson correlation coefficient @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the temperature map ( colors from white to dark red indicates an increasing , positive correlation ) for the five financial layers ( 1 to 5 ) and the five environmental layers ( 6 to 10 ) .",
    "correlations are averaged over the period under investigation ( 2002 - 2010 ) .",
    "the first matrix shows correlations between flows going in the same direction ( synergic flows ) and the second shows correlations between flows going in opposite direction ( reverse flows ) .",
    "interestingly , the most correlated financial layers to the environmental ones are _ equities _",
    "( layer2 ) and _ total debts _ ( layer 5 ) .",
    "all the environmental layers , are more correlated to @xmath12 ( with the exception of reverse flows of water , layer 10 , that is correlated more with sd , layer2 ) .",
    "the second most correlated financial layer to the environment is _",
    "td_. among the environmental layers , @xmath2 ( layer 8) is always the most correlated to any financial layer .",
    "this may suggest that financial layers tend to be more correlated to manufacturing , metallurgy and industry in general that relies heavily on the combustion of raw fossil fuels , but more research is needed on this aspect .",
    "the second most correlated is @xmath0 ( layer 6 ) , further suggesting a link to combustion and , foremost , to low - efficiency combustion .",
    "this may hint at a specific topology in correlation that will be addressed further in a subsequent section of this paper .",

    "the footprint of water is high in the energy intensive and agricultural sectors , and in some manufactures .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    a second notable result of our analysis is that , in most cases ( 15 out of 25 , see table [ tab3 ] and [ tab4 ] in si ) and particularly for the most correlated layers ( equity , td , @xmath2 and @xmath0 ) , _ reverse _ flows display higher correlation to the environment than synergic flows , indicating that among oecd countries financial flows tend to be associated to environmental flows going in the _ opposite direction _ , more often than flows going in the _",
    "same direction_. furthermore , reverse correlations are more stable than synergic correlations ( see si for further details ) .",
    "reverse correlations among flows suggest that different layers tend to reciprocate .",
    "we measure the cross - product reciprocity between layer @xmath14 and @xmath15 and country @xmath6 and @xmath5 , normalized on country s exports ( @xmath16 ) @xcite :    @xmath17    figure [ fig2 ] shows the cross - product reciprocity between financial layers on aggregate ( the average of the four financial layers ) and environmental layers on aggregate ( the average of the five environmental layers ) . in the first matrix ( figure [ fig2 ] , left panel ) , entries ( countries ) are reported in alphabetical order , while in the second ( figure [ fig2 ] right panel ) , countries are ordered by increasing financialisation ( measured as value added of the financial sector over the total value added ) . shifting the array - order of countries we can see a gradient of increasing reciprocity emerging from the matrix , when going from less to more financialised countries .",
    "this result confirms that there is a specific topology in the financial - environment correlation network that mirrors the level of countries financialisaton",
    ". the top - right block of the matrix ( figure [ fig2 ] right panel ) shows an average higher reciprocity than the bottom - left block ( see table [ tab4 ] in si ) .",
    "this asymmetry is evident when looking at the different degrees of yellows in the two regions , indicating a dominant pattern of reciprocity .",
    "exports of finance from the most financialised countries ( entries 19 - 33 ) towards the less financialised ( entries 1 - 18 ) are more correlated to environmental imports than flows from low financialised to high financialised countries .",
    "the countries of the low financialised group show higher correlation with the countries of the high financialised group than within themselves , contrary to the the counties of this latter group , which are instead tightly connected among themselves . in other words",
    ", it seems that highly financialised countries tend to exchange financial flows with environmental flows with countries that are less financialised , by means , most prominently in terms of equities and td .",
    "given the prevalence of reverse correlations , we can focus our analysis on reciprocal exchanges between the financial layers and environmental layers .",
    "it should be noted that a _ multiplex _ is a very complex structure @xcite .",
    "spurious correlations may rise from overlapping effects driven by two factors : the reciprocity structure within each layer and the topology peculiar to each layer . in what follows ,",
    "we want to disentangle the correlation between each pair of layers from the topology specific to every single layer ( with respect to our analysis , reciprocity between layers can be considered as a different form of correlation ) . by utilising a methodology recently developed in @xcite ,",
    "we are able to provide a measure of correlation between layers for reverse flows , on both a global ( @xmath18 correlations ) and local scale ( equation [ localrho ] ) that incorporates a null model and thereby clearing spurious effects from our analysis : @xmath19 this measure signals when reciprocity exceeds the expected reciprocity trivially produced by the null model .",
    "the chosen null model is based on an exponential randomization that preserves export , import and reciprocated trade flows for each country pair , which are set as constrains into the model @xcite . on the one hand",
    ", this null model enables us to test previous results and , on the other hand , to extract the backbone of significant correlations among countries .",
    "according to the cross - product reciprocity and the statistical validation , results of the pearson index hold : equities and td are more correlated to environmental flows than fdi and reverse correlation tends to prevail over synergic correlation .",
    "we can further test the structure of the reciprocal relationship among oecd countries between financial outgoing flows and environmental incoming flows with the null model based on exponential random graph ( see si ) .",
    "the matrix of figure [ fig3 ] shows the reciprocal exchanges between financial layers and environmental layers exceeding the single - layer reciprocity level set by the null model .",
    "the degree of yellow signals positive values of @xmath18 whereas the white dots indicates that there is no significant correlation ( equation [ localrho ] ) .",
    "the top - right block shows , on average , stronger correlations than the bottom - left , pointing to a statistically significant connection between financial outgoing flows reciprocated by incoming environmental flows in the region of the highly financialised countries with respect to the lowest financialised countries ( table [ tab3 ] in si ) .    ) ; countries ordered by degree of financialisation , left to right ( years 2002 - 2010 ) .",

    "links map the network backbone of positive correlations exceeding the level of significance posed by the null model .",
    "the arrows in the right panel of figure [ fig3 ] stand for a statistically significant outgoing financial flow reciprocated by an incoming environmental flow . for almost all layer pairs and for the financial - environmental layers in aggregate",
    ", the backbone of the correlation network highlights the central role of five distinctive nodes : usa , france , germany , bel - lux and uk . figure [ fig4 ] show the case of the equity layer compared to the five environmental layers .",
    "those five countries display double the number of links compared to the other oecd countries ( figure [ s3 fig ] ) .",
    "this observation mirrors the central role these countries take in both financial markets and international trade . contrary to most of the developed and financialised countries , usa , france , germany , and uk ,",
    "are net importers of environmental flows , with the remarkable exception of bel - lux ( figure [ s4 fig ] ) . at the same time , but not surprisingly , these five countries are also net importers of financial flows ( figure [ s5 fig ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that these five countries are net importers in terms the value and the mass of international trade of goods .",
    "industrialized countries transform row materials into composite goods .",
    "this explains their negative mass imbalance .",
    "goods that are positioned higher in the value chain have arguably a lesser content of mass and an higher environmental footprint by unit of value .    , @xmath1 , @xmath9 @xmath2 , @xmath3 @xmath4 and water footprint .",
    "increasing dark red indicate an increasing out - degree of the node .",
    "the hubs are pleaced in the core of the cloud .",
    "the reciprocity analysis confirms that equity is mostly reciprocated with @xmath0 and @xmath2 , suggesting a link with the industrial sector . ]",
    "in this paper , we have focused on the linkage between financial and environmental movements which are generated by cross - border investment activities and the trade of goods .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , we have compared the correlation between environmental and portfolio investment flows , including fdi as well as ipi .",
    "we have found that most environmental indicators , apart from water , are highly correlated with short term financial flows ( which might also be more speculative in nature ) than fdis , which are mainly long - term and stable investments in the real economy .",
    "this result appears to be coherent with the hypothesis that short - termism is not only linked to the financial system s stability but also to the real economy and environmental sustainability .",
    "a second finding is that reverse flows , particularly short term equity trades , show higher correlation with environmental flows than synergic flows , indicating that , among oecd countries , financial flows tend to be associated with environmental flows going in the opposite direction . reverse correlations among flows suggest that different layers tend to reciprocate .",
    "furthermore , the dominant pattern in reverse correlations between finance and environment is seen to be directed from more financialised to less financialised countries .",
    "the conclusion from this is that agents in net - importer and highly financilised countries tend to take speculative exposures in stocks traded in less industrialized countries .",
    "however , not all fiancialised countries exhibit a signicant correlation between financial layers and environmental layers ( see table [ tab_oecd ] of si for the complete ranking of oecd countries ) .",
    "the back - bone within this highly complex structure is formed by five countries , which are themselves hubs for international trade and investment , namely : the usa , france , germany , bel - lux and the uk .",
    "these five countries are both net importers of finance and net importers of mass",
    ". do these results , concerning the topology of correlations , hold even if we would enlarge the scope of the analysis , including emerging economies and developing countries ?",
    "what is the causal relationship beyond these correlations ?",
    "do financial investments draw environmental load or financial flows follow the channels of trade ? these questions remain unanswered because of limitations of the model and uncertainties in the data .",
    "although we can not derive conclusions on causality , we built a first step in contributing to these areas of research in three main ways : by applying network analysis instruments to study the links between financial flows and trade - related environmental movements ( beyond bilateral view ) , by including portfolio investment flows ( beyond fdi ) , and by evaluating trade flows according to their environmental content rather than in monetary or mass terms ( beyond disciplinary separatism ) .",
    "what we get is a picture of the world , albeit reduced to only oecd countries , of immense complexity , in which the interacting systems , even those seemingly distinct , can not be seen separately .",
    "to say it succinctly , with the stylish and sarcastic words of oscar wilde@xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ london is too full of fogs and serious people .",

    "this work would have not been possible .",
    "what is a _ multiplex _ ?",
    "a multiplex is a bundle of networks ( layers ) that share the _ same nodes _ but potentially with different flows ( edges ) within each layer .",
    "each network , or _ layer _ , can feature relationships of the _ same nature _ and measured in the same unit or can display a broad variety of connections and , thus , links will be measured in different units @xcite .",
    "metrics of our analysis will be of two natures : monetary units ( usd ) for the financial layers and mass units for the environmental layers ( table [ tab_layers ] ) .",
    "the nodes of the multiplex are 33 oecd countries and will be ordered in every layers matrix adjacency according to the increasing financialisation of their economy , expressed by value added accounted by financial intermediation , real estate , renting and business activities as a percentage of total value added in 2000 , namely prior to the period under study ( table [ tab_oecd ] ) .",
    "we analyzed the interactions of the resulting financial - environmental multiplex over a time span of 9 years , from 2002 to 2010 .",
    "these multiplex interactions over 9 years for 10 layers and 33 nodes can be expressed as a tensor @xmath21 with dimensions ( @xmath22 ) and the entry of the tensor @xmath23 expresses the flow of the layer @xmath24 at time @xmath25 from country @xmath6 to country @xmath5 .",
