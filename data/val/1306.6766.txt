    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data have been crucial to define and confirm the currently favored cosmological model : a flat cosmological constant  dominated , cold dark matter model , @xmath1cdm .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that cmb observations predominantly probe the physics of the early universe ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "when these observations are interpreted in terms of the standard cosmological parameters , defined at @xmath5 , an extrapolation is needed , which is done within a given cosmological model . in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we argued that local , model - independent measurements of cosmologically - relevant quantities can be used to test the self - consistency of the currently favored cosmological model and to constrain deviations from it .",
    "direct measurements of the hubble constant and age of the universe are especially suited to this aim .",
    "in fact , these measurements have a long history and have now reached a level of precision and accuracy that make them competitive with other cosmological observations .",
    "if local and high - redshift measurements are to be combined to constrain cosmological parameters within a given model , the well established framework of bayesian parameter inference can be used . however ,",
    "if the two sets of measurements are to be used to distinguish between models then bayesian model selection and bayesian evidence ( model - averaged likelihood ) should be used @xcite .",
    "bayesian methods in cosmology have been used for almost two decades now ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    ref .",
    "@xcite used pre-_planck _ state of the art data , so it is a natural extension to that work to consider the post-_planck _",
    "@xcite state - of - the - art cosmological data .",
    "the _ planck _",
    "team official analysis pointed out that local direct measurements of the hubble constant seem to be at odds with cmb data when interpreted within the context of the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "cmb data are however not at odds with other cosmological measurements ( e.g. , baryon acoustic oscillations ) .",
    "this conclusion arises from a parameter - estimation analysis , where the best fit value of the hubble constant extrapolated from cmb data is @xmath6 away from the direct measurement .",
    "we will examine these findings in the framework of bayesian model selection and discuss their implications for cosmology .",
    "we will also consider measurements of the age of the universe and investigate whether , from a model selection point of view , the tension between local and high redshift measurements disfavors the @xmath1cdm model in favor of a more complex model .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] , we present the data sets and combinations of data sets we will use . in sec .  [",
    "sec : methods ] , we review different statistics that measure the  distance \" or the  difference \" between two distributions .",
    "we present our statistic of choice that stems from the bayesian evidence ratio and is suited to assess whether two posterior distributions from two different experiments are in tension or not .",
    "we present our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , where we examine the tension between local and high redshift cosmological measurements .",
    "we then explore several possibilities for this tension and examine the consequences both in terms of unknown errors and deviations from the @xmath1cdm model . finally , we conclude in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] . in [ sec : kld ] , we report the kullback - leibler divergence between planck and wmap for selected models and parameters .",
    "we consider the _ planck _",
    "mission cmb data with local measurements of the hubble parameter @xmath7 and of the age of the universe @xmath8 .",
    "the planck collaboration , along with the nominal mission temperature data , has also released the outputs of the markov chains monte carlo ( mcmc ) used to sample from the space of possible cosmological parameters .",
    "these mcmcs have been used by the team to generate estimates of the posterior mean of cosmological parameters , along with their confidence intervals @xcite . here",
    ", we use the publicly available outputs of the _ planck _ team mcmcs .",
    "the _ planck _",
    "data have been analyzed by the team in several ways : using only planck temperature data on scales corresponding to multipoles @xmath9 ( _ planck _ ) , using planck data in conjunction with wmap polarization data at low @xmath10 ( _ wp _ ) , and using planck data , wmap data and also include the measurement of the lensing potential , which was reconstructed from the planck temperature maps themselves through the measurement of the four - point function ( _ lensing _ ) . in some cases ,",
    "data from high - resolution but partial sky ground - based cmb experiments ( act and spt ) have also been included ( _ highl _ ) . in combination with planck these data",
    "better constrain the foreground - model parameters . here",
    "however , we concentrate on the _ planck + wp _ data combination . except in the appendix",
    ", we will not consider the _ lensing _ information in line with the considerations presented in @xcite ; the combination _",
    "planck + wp+highl _ predicts a value for the lensing amplitude which is about @xmath11 higher than the value measured from the convergence power spectrum @xcite and the origin of this tension is not yet fully understood .      for the local data we follow exactly ref .",
    "we combine the values reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite in a  world average \" where the central value is given by the variance - weighted mean and the error conservatively given by the average of the errors : @xmath12 km s@xmath13mpc@xmath13 .",
    "estimates of the age of the universe can be obtained from the ages of the oldest objects and in particular from the ages of the oldest stars since these objects form very shortly after the big bang .",
    "accurate dating of globular clusters has been the subject of active investigation for decades but the error bars were , for a long time , large .",
    "it is only relatively recently that error - bars have become smaller due to better estimates of their distances @xcite or the use of distance independent methods @xcite .",
    "recently , it has become possible to use single stars to estimate @xmath8 ; accurate distances using direct parallax measurements were obtained for nearby sub - giant stars . in particular the star hd 140283 is a sub - giant moving off the main sequence , so its luminosity is a very good age - indicator .",
    "consequently , in order to constrain the current age of the universe , we use recent determinations of the ages of the oldest stars in the milky way .",
    "we use two kind of measurements : the age of the nearby sub - giant hd-140283 and the ages of the oldest globular clusters .",
    "the age of hd-140283 has been accurately measured by @xcite using hst parallaxes and spectroscopic determinations of its chemical abundance .",
    "in addition , they have used state of the art stellar evolutionary models and carried out a careful and extensive error budget .",
    "the age of hd-140283 is determined to be @xmath14 gyr ( including systematic errors , which dominate the error bar ) .",
    "additionally , the ages for some of the most metal poor milky way globular clusters ( ngc 6397 , ngc 6752 , and 47 tuc ) have been determined by ref .  @xcite . taking into account the revised nuclear reaction rate for @xmath15 of the cno burning cycle @xcite",
    ", we obtain an age @xmath16 gyr . in what follows we will linearly add these ( random and statistics ) two sources of errors .",
    "it is remarkable that age determinations for such different systems are in such a good agreement .",
    "there are three main ingredients that dominate the error budget of stellar ages : distance , chemical composition and theory of stellar evolution .",
    "the last one has been studied with extreme care in the last decade and major improvements have been made .",
    "it is very unlikely that stellar evolution theory needs any further significant revisions ; the contribution to the age error budget from stellar evolution theory is now negligible contributing to about 1% to the total age uncertainty .",
    "the two dominant error sources remain distance and chemical composition .",
    "the distance uncertainty can be efficiently removed by obtaining trigonometric parallaxes to the oldest stars or globular clusters .",
    "this has been the case for hd-140283 . however , for the globular clusters it is not yet possible to obtain trigonometric parallaxes and distances have to be obtained by indirect methods .",
    "currently the uncertainty budget in the age determination of galactic globular clusters is dominated by its distance estimation , which is done via indirect methods ( sub - dwarf fitting ) .    on the other hand , the dominant source of error of nearby sub - giants is the chemical composition of the stars .",
    "current 10-meter class telescope observations provide abundance with an accuracy of @xmath17 dex , which translates into a @xmath18% uncertainty when estimating the age of the oldest stars .",
    "the ages determinations of nearby sub - giants and globular clusters are dominated by different and independent systematics ( chemical abundance and distance respectively ) and we therefore combine the two above measurements by inverse variance weighting . recall that the ages of the oldest objects at @xmath19 only provide a lower estimate of @xmath8 .",
    "however , we know that the first generation of stars formed at @xmath20 @xcite . at this redshift the age of the universe is only @xmath21 gyr , which is much smaller than the current age estimation errors .",
    "this formation time - lag will only play a role when age estimations uncertainties are reduced by at least a factor of five , to the @xmath22% level . in our analysis",
    "we convert the age of the star to the age of the universe by adding to the stellar age @xmath23 gyr , assuming a gaussian distribution ( cutting negative tails when appropriate ) .",
    "we obtain the following estimate for the age of the universe : @xmath24 . here",
    "we assume gaussian distributions for both @xmath7 and @xmath8 measurements .",
    "it is important to note that the error - budget in the age determination will change dramatically with the launch of the gaia satellite in october 2013 .",
    "gaia will obtain trigonometric parallaxes to globular clusters and identify a large number of metal - poor sub - giants .",
    "therefore , the only dominant source of error remaining will be the chemical composition of the stars .",
    "a way to improve on this will be to obtain longer integrations or use different line diagnostic for the metallicity in the infrared .",
    "thus the dominant uncertainty in the error budget for the age of the local universe , will be the chemical composition reaching an error - floor of @xmath25% ; see @xcite for discussion .",
    "the questions we wish to address are the following . _",
    "a ) _ we have two measurements of cosmologically interesting quantities in the form of a two or higher dimensional posterior distribution . in our application",
    "these two measurements are the high - redshift , model - dependent joint distribution of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the local , cosmological - model - independent one . in the bayesian framework ,",
    "how would one quantify whether these two measurements are or not in agreement ( tension ) ? in other words , if the null hypothesis is that the two measurements are  sampled \" from the base model adopted , when should the null hypothesis be abandoned ?",
    "if the answer to _ a ) _ is that the two measurements are in tension , then bayesian model selection can be used to study extensions to the base model adopted and select which is the favored model .",
    "alternatively the detected tension might indicate the presence of unaccounted for , residual systematic errors .",
    "possible options at this point are : discredit the measurement most likely affected by systematics or artificially increase its errors .",
    "if instead no tension is detected the measurements can be combined to perform , for example , joint parameter estimation .    clearly to address this type of question a measure of distance or difference between two distributions should be used .",
    "there are many statistics that quantify the difference between two distributions .",
    "the most widely used are the kullback - leibler divergence @xcite , the jeffrey s divergence @xcite , and jensen - shannon divergence @xcite .",
    "these are well rooted in information theory and they measure the difference between two probability distributions , say @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and therefore are suited to quantify how well @xmath26 approximates @xmath27 or the information content that @xmath27 adds to @xmath26 .",
    "in fact the kullback - leibler divergence is not symmetric ( clearly , the information content that @xmath27 adds to @xmath26 is not the information content that @xmath26 adds to @xmath27 ) and the jeffrey s divergence and jensen - shannon divergence are two approaches to symmetrize it .",
    "we will explore the application to cosmology of the entropy - based kullback - leibler divergence measure in the appendix . for our question _ a ) _ at hand we know _ a priori _ that we will be comparing two different distributions ( in fact we are comparing different experiments ) .",
    "we want to know wether the best fit values are consistent given the shape of the respective distributions , in other words we need the bayesian ( multi - dimensional ) parallel of the standard equivalency test . and @xmath28 )",
    "of the same quantity , the standard equivalency test says that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are consistent within the errors if @xmath31 .",
    "] we argue that this is given by the evidence ratio as follows .",
    "imagine we have performed two experiments : @xmath32 and for each experiment we produce a posterior @xmath33 where @xmath34 represents the parameters of the model and @xmath35 represents the data from experiments @xmath32 respectively .",
    "let us also assume that for producing both posteriors we have used the same , uniform priors over the same  support \" , x , i.e. , @xmath36 , @xmath37 or @xmath38 and therefore @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 be the ( null ) hypothesis that both experiments measure the same quantity , the models are correct and there are no unaccountable errors . in this case",
    ", the two experiments will produce two posteriors , which , although can have different ( co)variances , and different distributions , have means that are in agreement .",
    "the alternative hypothesis , @xmath41 is when the two experiments , for some unknown reason , do not agree , either because of systematic errors or because they are effectively measuring different things or the model ( parameterization ) is incorrect . in this case",
    ", the two experiments will produce two posteriors with two different means and different variances .      in any practical application , the absolute normalization of the posteriors is often unknown , but we can still work as follows .",
    "we define : @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the likelihood and @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 is the bayesian evidence for the joint distribution , thus @xmath46 is akin to an unnormalized evidence .",
    "operationally , to deal with the ( difficult to compute ) normalization factor let us now imagine that we can perform a _ translation _ ( shift ) of ( one or both of ) the distributions in @xmath47 and let us define @xmath48 the shifted distribution",
    ". this translation changes the location of the maximum but does not change the shape or the width of the distribution .",
    "if the maxima of the two distributions coincide then @xmath49 this can be considered our  straw man \" null hypothesis . as the distance between the maxima increases (",
    "but the shape of the distributions remains the same ) , @xmath50 and eventually @xmath51 as the two distributions diverge .",
    "clearly the evidence ratio for the ( null ) hypothesis @xmath52 is @xmath53 , as the normalization factors @xmath54 cancel out , and the evidence ratio for the alternative @xmath41 is its reciprocal .",
    "we therefore introduce : @xmath55 which denotes the degree of tension that can be interpreted in the widely used ( slightly modified , @xcite ) jeffrey s @xcite scale ( tab . [ tab : scale ] ) .",
    "@xmath0 indicates the odds : @xmath56 are the chances for the null hypothesis . in other words , a large tension mens that the null hypothesis ( @xmath57 = @xmath58 ) is unlikely .",
