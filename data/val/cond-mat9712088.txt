    "the bcs theory of superconductivity and its extension eliashberg theory describe the electronic properties of the superconducting state in terms of self - energies which arise from the interaction of the superconducting quasiparticles with a boson which provides the mechanism for superconductivity@xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the direct coulomb interaction among the quasiparticles leads to renormalizations of the quasiparticle effective mass and lifetime in the normal state but that these renormalizations are unaffected by the superconducting transition . within this approximation direct interactions among the superconducting quasiparticles",
    "are ignored and the only indication of interactions in the superconducting state are the @xmath1 strong - coupling features which appear in tunneling experiments and measurements of optical conductivity .",
    "the @xmath1 function then gives information on the density of the bosons and the strength of interaction with the quasiparticles .",
    "this has proved to be a very successful treatment of the properties of conventional superconductors where this mean field approximation for the direct long - range coulomb interaction is justified by data .",
    "models for the mechanism of high t@xmath2 superconductivity are based on the magnetic properties arising form strong short range coulomb correlations as described in the hubbard model .",
    "treatments of these models also frequently assume that the normalizations determined in the normal state are unaffected by the transition to superconductivity .",
    "however quasiparticle interactions in the ordered state have been shown to renormalize the superconducting gap , change the temperature dependence of the gap , and lead to finite quasiparticle lifetimes@xcite . in the cuprate superconductors",
    "quasiparticle interactions lead to a feature in tunneling conductance across an superconductor - insulator - superconductor(@xmath3 ) junction at @xmath4 in addition to the peak at @xmath5 expected from the mean field approximation@xcite .",
    "it is the scaling of the dip feature with @xmath6 which distinguishes these corrections from the usual features in @xmath1 associated with the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "this scaling was originally demonstrated by comparing the tunneling conductance curves for a set of cuprate superconductors whose t@xmath2 s varied from 5k to 100k@xcite .",
    "more recently the intrinsic nature of this strong - coupling feature was demonstrated by comparing the tunneling conductance for bi@xmath7sr@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath8 as a function of doping and seeing the dip feature scale with the position of the 2@xmath6 peak@xcite .",
    "the size of the dip feature is much larger than the conventional electron - phonon corrections in the cuprates .",
    "this dip feature has been seen in the tunneling results of a number of groups@xcite and the corresponding feature in the spectral density has also been identified in arpes(angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ) data on bi@xmath7sr@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath8@xcite and has recently generated a renewed interest@xcite .",
    "the magnitude of these corrections to the mean field treatment of superconductivity in the cuprates distinguishes the cuprates from conventional superconductors .",
    "corrections to the mean field approximation , although present in conventional superconductors , do not in general lead to experimentally detected features . in this paper",
    "i argue that it is the low - dimensionality of the cuprate superconductors which is responsible for the comparatively large effects of quasiparticle interactions in the cuprates compared to conventional 3d superconductors . in low dimensional systems fluctuations",
    "lead to the destruction of long - range order . in one dimension",
    "quantum fluctuations of the order parameter are sufficient to destroy long - range order@xcite and in two - dimensions thermal fluctuations destroy the order@xcite . given this the effects of quantum fluctuations on superconducting properties",
    "would be expected to be more important in 2d than in 3d .",
    "this is investigated using a model hamiltonian for 2d and 3d s - wave superconductors at zero temperature which includes the coulomb interaction between electrons and the pairing interaction originally introduced by bcs which is characterized by a magnitude @xmath9 for electrons within an energy @xmath10 of the fermi surface .    in this paper",
    "i show how the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction leads to a qualitative difference in the quasiparticle properties of 2d and 3d s - wave superconductors .",
    "as anderson@xcite pointed out the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction leads to the disappearance of the gapless mode associated with the phase of the superconductor order parameter in three dimensions and collective mode becomes the plasmon at energies much higher the energy scale of superconductivity . as a result the collective mode has no influence on superconducting properties@xcite .",
    "this is not the case in two dimensions where the collective mode remains gapless just as the plasmon mode does for the 2d electron gas@xcite .",
    "this leads to the possibility for the collective mode having a strong influence on quasiparticle properties unlike the case in three dimensions .",
    "interactions among electrons are described by the coulomb interaction and the pairing interaction responsible for the s - wave superconductivity in the generalized random phase approximation .",
    "i show that the quasiparticle interactions in the 2d superconductor are stronger than in the 3d case and that this difference can be traced to the low lying collective mode and the enhanced magnitude of the effective interaction at low frequencies compared to that in 3d .",
    "most models of the electronic properties of the cuprate superconductors have emphasized their layered nature and have employed 2d or quasi-2d hamiltonians .",
    "these models have stressed short - range correlations either through an on - site hubbard repulsion , in the weak or strong - coupling limits , or phenomenologically through residual short - range antiferromagnetic order which survives in the doped materials@xcite . in these models",
    "a tight - binding bandstructure is used with either an on - site hubbard repulsion coming from the weak - coupling side or the @xmath11 model coming from the strong - coupling side .",
    "both approaches have been shown to be consistent with the @xmath12 symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "the importance of long - range correlations coming from the coulomb interaction in quasi-2d systems , such as the layered cuprate superconductors , have not been considered in these treatments but potentially have a strong influence on the properties of quasi-2d superconductors .",
    "the single - particle self - energies are calculated here for 2d and 3d s - wave superconductors and it is found that their magnitude in 2d is roughly ten times the value in 3d .",
    "the single - particle self - energies also have a stronger frequency dependence in 2d than in 3d which leads to stronger signatures of quasiparticle interactions in the spectral density and in the tunneling conductance of 2d superconductors compared to those in 3d superconductors .",
    "i calculate the strong - coupling corrections in model s - wave superconductor introduced and discuss how these results are related to experimental data on the cuprates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the model is introduced . in section iii the nature of the collective modes and their coupling to quasiparticle excitations are reviewed .",
    "the calculated single - particle self - energies are discussed in section iv and the influence of quasiparticle interactions on measured quantities is discussed in section v. the implications of the results presented here for work on the properties of the cuprates are discussed in section vi . a preliminary report of this work has appeared elsewhere@xcite .",

    "this structure in @xmath197 causes fluctuations in the density of states of the renormalized quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "consequently the strong - coupling features in the density of states and the sis tunneling arise from the momentum and energy dependence of @xmath176 due to quasiparticle interactions .",
    "the form of @xmath204 comes from the continuum and collective contributions to the imaginary part of the self - energy , @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "from the kramers - kronig relation , the energy dependent real part of the self - energy is @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the integral from the high energy cutoff , @xmath209 , to infinity and over the negative energies which give only weak energy dependence .    in order to better understand",
    "the from of @xmath205 near @xmath210 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 can be approximated by simple analytic forms . from figure 3",
    "these can be approximate by @xmath211 with @xmath212 .",
    "@xmath205 increases more rapidly than this linear function by @xmath213 but this approximation is sufficient to give a semi - quantitative account .",
    "i take @xmath214 , where @xmath215 is a function approximately the form of the energy dependence of the collective mode contribution .",
    "looking at the form of the collective mode contribution in figure 3 it can be approximated by @xmath216 .",
    "taking this form and requiring that the maximum value of @xmath206 be @xmath217 as in figure 3 requires @xmath218 for @xmath219 .",
    "@xmath220 grows from zero at @xmath221 and is independent of @xmath164 beyond @xmath200 .",
    "putting in the forms of the two contributions to the @xmath145 @xmath222 and @xmath223 \\cr & + & { { \\alpha_p}\\over{\\pi } } \\biggl[(\\omega_p-3\\delta)ln{{|\\omega_p-3\\delta|}\\over{\\omega_p-3\\delta } } -(e_p-3\\delta)ln{{|e_p-3\\delta|}\\over{\\omega_p-3\\delta}}\\biggr]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from figure 11 it can be seen that @xmath224 so that @xmath225 giving @xmath226\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    0.3 cm    using @xmath220 discussed above one finds from equation ( 33 ) that the magnitude of @xmath204 is enhanced over that of @xmath194 by about 5% .",
    "considering the simple form of the functions used this is consistent with the results shown in figure 11 . taking @xmath227 and @xmath228 to be constants and allowing @xmath220 to increase by about @xmath229 between @xmath201 and for @xmath230 , consistent the calculation of @xmath145 , the form of @xmath194 for @xmath231",
    "is seen to come from the combination of the @xmath232 and the @xmath233 terms .",
    "the weak features in curve b , @xmath234 vs.@xmath235 , at @xmath236 come from the term proportional to @xmath228 in equation ( 34 ) where the term in the brackets goes through maxima in magnitude .",
    "however a better approximation for the momentum and energy dependence of @xmath237 is required beyond the form used here in order to recover the @xmath164 dependence of @xmath194 between @xmath201 and @xmath238 without a detailed fitting of the @xmath208 and @xmath227 functions .",
    "the @xmath220 term coming from the collective contribution to @xmath237 is responsible for the bump feature in @xmath239 between @xmath240 .",
    "it is clear that without the collective mode contribution the bump in the density of states below @xmath241 would be absent and the step at @xmath242 would be more pronounced .",
    "as well as tunneling conductance and the density of states discussed here arpes experiments can provide information on the single - quasiparticle spectral density once background has been taken into account . in the calculation discussed above the spectral density",
    "is a lorentzian with no experimentally detectable non monotonic energy dependence away from the peak .",
    "many - body effects give a non - trivial quasiparticle spectrum , @xmath197 , leading to the strong - coupling effects discussed above but do not lead to any signatures in arpes measurement such as the dip feature at @xmath243 in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "a necessary condition that features away from the quasiparticle peak in the spectral density lead to observable features in arpes is that the imaginary part of the self - energy should have both a strong energy dependence and be sufficiently large that there is weight away the peak . in the present case",
    "the linear dependence of @xmath190 on @xmath164 and the small magnitude combine to ensure that the energy dependence of @xmath145 leads to no features in arpes or tunneling conductance .",
    "this is in contrast to models used to describe arpes and tunneling data in the cuprates@xcite where the strong - coupling feature is at @xmath5 in the density of states and the spectral density , as measured in arpes,@xcite and at @xmath4 in the sis tunneling conductance . in these models a phenomenological form for @xmath143",
    "is used in which there is a rapid increase in the magnitude of @xmath145 to a value @xmath0 in some momentum directions at @xmath156 after which any dependence of @xmath145 on e is weak . in these models @xmath176 is assumed to lead only to a renormalization of the gap .",
    "this model for @xmath145 in the case of a d - wave superconductor is suggested by golden - rule calculation of the decay of mean field quasiparticles in a tight - binding bandstructure@xcite .",
    "the results of the tight - binding calculations depend on both the chemical potential and the presence of next - nearest neighbor terms in the bandstructure .",
    "the form of @xmath145 is consistent with that arising from low energy antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations@xcite .",
    "the bandstructure and short - range correlations leading to low energy magnetic excitations which are responsible for the strong - coupling effects in the models of the cuprates are absent in the calculation reported here .",
    "however the present calculation points to the necessity of including long range coulomb interaction in order to distinguish low dimensional from conventional superconductors and suggests that any model which is to quantitatively account for these features in the cuprates should incorporate the effects of long - range correlations as well as the short - range correlation associated with the magnetic properties of the cuprates .",
    "the extent to which a superconductor is low dimensional , where the effects discussed would be important , l is determined in the model described here by the weight in the effective quasiparticle interaction due to the coulomb interaction at low frequencies . in layered superconductors",
    "das sarma et al.@xcite have shown that depending on interplanar coupling and on the direction of the wavevector the collective mode spectrum , @xmath111 , is at energies @xmath0 as @xmath244 .",
    "there should still be substantial weight in the collective mode at frequencies @xmath245 in order for quasiparticle interactions to be enhanced above the 3d case .",
    "this issue is presently being investigated@xcite .    since the original identification of the dip feature in arpes",
    "there have been suggestions that it is strongly associated with the mechanism for superconductivity in the cuprates .",
    "arnold et al.@xcite identified the strong - coupling features seen in the data of dessau et al.@xcite . with a  bosonic peak \" which they proceeded to analyze in terms of the @xmath1 function of eliashberg theory .",
    "analysis of more recent data have lead shen and schrieffer@xcite to a model where the quasiparticles are strongly coupled to a collective mode . this collective mode contributes to the line shape in arpes in the normal state and is strongly influenced by the superconducting transition . in their picture the dip feature in the line shape is the consequence of the strong quasiparticle coupling to the collective mode which provides the pairing mechanism for hit@xmath2 superconductivity . in the present case also",
    "the collective mode is strongly effected by the transition to superconducting ground state although it is not associated with the mechanism for superconductivity .",
    "it decays into pairs of superconducting quasiparticles once its energy reaches @xmath5 , reemerges at higher energies and essentially follows the dispersion of the normal state plasmon .",
    "the contribution to off - shell self - energy , @xmath246 , from scattering from the plasmon is very weak at the low energies , @xmath0 , for the 2d electron gas .",
    "it leads to a weak feature in the spectral density even at @xmath247 which corresponds to @xmath248 for @xmath249 and would not be detected easily in experiment@xcite .",
    "in this paper i have shown how quantum fluctuations in 2d charged fermi systems are enhanced over those in 3d .",
    "this result holds for both the normal and superconducting states .",
    "however in the superconducting state they clearly lead to strong - coupling features in experimental quantities which are a probe of the superconducting state .    in the model discussed in this paper",
    "the quasiparticle interaction responsible for the feature at @xmath242 in sin for s - wave superconductor and the corresponding feature at @xmath250 in sis is the coulomb interaction and not the pairing interaction giving the s - wave superconducting ground state . in the absence of the coulomb interaction",
    "the pairing interaction would produce the same feature but would not account for the difference in magnitude of these effects in conventional 3d superconductors and the quasi-2d cuprate superconductors .",
    "the anomalously large magnitude of the strong coupling features seen in the cuprates suggest that the electronic properties of these materials are quasi-2d .",
    "this is a basic assumption which most workers in the area have employed for a long time",
    ". however the long range part of the coulomb interaction has been ignored .",
    "the present calculation suggests that , although the interactions which provide the mechanism for superconductivity in the cuprates may be short correlations , long range coulomb correlations should also be included .",
    "in particular the pairing mechanism undoubtedly contributes to the magnitude of the feature at @xmath251 in arpes data and to the strong - coupling features seen in tunneling experiments at @xmath189 but they are unlikely to solely account for its magnitude .    p.b .",
