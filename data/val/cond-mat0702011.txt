    "the description of systems of strongly correlated electrons provided by the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) has significantly improved our understanding of this class of materials.@xcite the major limitation of dmft lies in its single - site nature ,  @xcite which makes it unable to account for spatial correlations in finite - dimensional systems . to remedy this deficiency , cluster generalizations of dmft",
    "have been devised ( see discussions on this subject in refs .   and ) .",
    "however , in order to recover the thermodynamic limit , clusters of sufficiently large size should be used.@xcite this strongly enhances the numerical effort needed to solve the corresponding dmft equations , because the number of quantum variables to be simulated grows proportionally to the number of atoms in the cluster . to alleviate this difficulty ,",
    "less costly but less accurate numerical approaches have been proposed.@xcite in our opinion , this is not a viable solution , because the reduction of errors brought about by the larger number of atoms in the cluster can be overcompensated by the cruder treatment of the quantum effects .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to propose a perturbative approach accounting for nonlocal corrections to dmft , with the latter being considered as the zeroth order approximation .",
    "the approach derives from the general method proposed in ref .  .",
    "this so - called gamma - expansion method ( gem ) proved to be successful , _ inter alia _ , in the treatment of the local atomic correlations or short range order in the electronic theory of alloys .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we apply it to the hubbard model on a square lattice and in the insulating phase , which is well described by the alloy analogy ( or hubbard iii approximation ) @xcite , and therefore should be amenable to the same technique .",
    "this will be illustrated below with an explicit calculation of the magnetic short range order ( sro ) for this model .",
    "the non - local magnetic correlations are of paramount importance for the theories of high temperature superconductivity based on the spin fluctuation mechanism,@xcite and their enhancement should therefore be of interest in these theories .",
    "in particular , both the neel and the superconducting transition temperatures should monotonically depend on the strength of the short range magnetic correlations . in this respect",
    "the observation made in ref . that different cluster theories give short range correlations differing roughly by a factor of two provides an additional reason for developing non - cluster based treatments of non - local correlations .",
    "the proposed expansion is based in part on the widely accepted opinion that the single - site dmft which is exact in infinite dimensions provides us with a picture of the strong correlation phenomena which is qualitatively valid also in physical dimensions @xmath013 . in other words , it is the single - site dynamics which contain the essence of the problem while intersite correlations play lesser role and so may be considered as correction terms .",
    "an approximate non - local theory in finite dimensions , in which the single - site dmft is used as the source of information on the local correlations has recently been proposed by kusunose@xcite and toschi et al.@xcite .",
    "in essence , the method consists in first finding _ local _ irreducible vertex functions from the full dmft correlators and then using these in the bethe - salpeter@xcite or parquet@xcite equations coupled with dyson - like equations for the electron self - energy with _",
    "nonlocal _ electron propagators in order to find the _",
    "nonlocal _ self - energy . from our point of view",
    "the main deficiency of such approaches is the lack of consistency : the electron propagators in a skeleton expansion are the same in side - pieces and inside the crosspieces of a ladder diagram . taking into account",
    "that for large values of the coupling constant there is no reasons for the smallness of the terms in the ladder sums , in a strict mathematical sense the series are divergent .",
    "so the neglect of non - local contributions in some parts of the diagrams not only is unfounded but may also lead to serious numerical errors . in ref .",
    "a reference to the spirit of the dmft in infinite dimensions was invoked where the irreducible vertices inside the ladder series can be chosen to be local without loss of accuracy.@xcite this , however , is completely due to specifics of the @xmath1 case , while in finite dimensions the leading nonlocal corrections are are proportional to @xmath2@xcite and thus are quite large in physical dimensions @xmath013 . in our approach , however , the smallness of the non - local contributions can be explicitely established _ a priori_.",

    "a method of explicit calculation of these corrections was proposed , based on the observation that in the self - consistent perturbation theory the feynman diagrams are expressed through the exact correlation function ( or propagator ) @xmath24 .",

    "the importance of this observation lies in the fact that this term leads to the magnetic susceptibility satisfying the curie law which we are going to show with explicit calculations below .    among the diagrams of fig .",

    "a curie - like behavior is characteristic for localized spins but is difficult to understand in the case of itinerant spins of band electrons.@xcite the latter situation may be described by the hubbard model in the weak coupling limit @xmath144 . because in this case conventional perturbation theory applies ,",
    "all calculations can be done in the finite bandwidth case .",
    "but it is more instructive to see how the perturbative limit is attained in the formalism of the gem . to this end",
    "we first note that the approximation ( [ v4 ] ) is not appropriate in the weak coupling case because it is of second order in @xmath38 .",
    "going back to the defining equation ( [ chi ] ) , we find that the first order term has the small-@xmath38 limit @xmath145 where we presented the amputated version of the connected correlator because in this case the atomic correlator is the same as in the band case . as we see , now the vertex functions in the diagrams of fig.[fig1 ] contain an additional factor @xmath18 , so that the mechanism of the low - temperature enhancement leading to the curie law is not operative any more .",
    "because of this and because of the smallness of @xmath38 it is the first diagram in fig .  [ fig1 ] which is the main contribution with the second diagram giving the first order correction .",
    "because the first order hartree term in the green functions is exact and the vertex in eq .",

    "the mechanism at the origin of the enhancement in the loop summations in the half - filled hubbard model will also be operative in the diagram for the lowest - order non - local correction to the self - energy shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that ( i ) the contribution to @xmath110 coming from the term ( [ deltar ] ) can be obtained by simply contracting @xmath146 and @xmath147 at nearest neighbor sites and ( ii ) by noting that the contribution thus obtained should be multiplied by 3/2 because the term ( [ deltar ] ) coming from the product ( [ s - s+ ] ) constitutes only 2/3 of the full scalar product @xmath148 constituting the full rotationally invariant singular interaction @xcite leading to the first term in eq .",

    "( [ chi ] ) , dominates in the weak coupling limit .",

    "the quantities in the right hand side of this equation should be obtained by analytic continuation from the discrete matsubara frequencies in the upper part of the complex energy plane @xmath154 to the real axis @xmath153 as @xmath155 this continuation is in general a non - trivial procedure because the quantities to be continued are usually known only in the form of the data of quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "continuation of such data to the real axis is an ill - posed problem the discussion of which as well as the pertinent bibliography may be found in ref .. we only would like to add that the continuation of a perturbation expansion ( like gem ) poses additional problems which are explained in appendix [ theorem ] .",
    "because of the simplicity of the hubbard iii approximation , however , it is possible to perform the above analytic continuation explicitly .",
    "this will be done below to illustrate the herglotz properties of the self - energy and the total density of states with the correction term given by eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) . to this end",
    "we first derive the expression for the corrected on - site green s function . for a hopping matrix connecting only nearest - neighbor sites , we get from eqs .  ( [ g - s ] ) and ( [ d ] ) ] @xmath156 from this expression",

    "however , from the point of view of gem , eq .  ( [ si ] ) is valid only to lowest order in @xmath161 .",
    "so it is more prudent ( and also more convenient for further analysis ) to separate different contributions as @xmath162 \\nonumber\\\\&+&[\\sigma_1(i\\omega)/t ] \\left[d(z)+zd^{\\prime}(z)\\right]_{z = i\\omega-\\sigma(i\\omega)+\\mu},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second line represents the lowest order correction to dmft ( the first line ) .",

    "the spatial attenuation ( [ gamma_def ] ) is defined by the green s function behavior at the discrete imaginary energies ( the matsubara frequencies ) , being more efficient at larger temperatures.@xcite therefore , there is no guarantee that the correction terms will remain small when continued to the real energy axis .",

    "we expect a transfer of spectral weight from the sides of the subbands to their centers as the temperature is lowered and @xmath166 becomes more negative .",
    "the physics of this transfer is the same as in the falicov - kimball ( f - k ) model of ref .. when the local order grows , the atoms became increasingly surrounded by sites with essentially different on - site potentials .",
    "in the f - k case these are the atoms filled by the @xmath150-electrons while in the hubbard case the surrounding atoms host the electrons of opposite spins .",
    "this hampers intersite atomic hopping and causes the subband narrowing . in the f - k model case",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "7 of ref .. the qualitative difference with our fig.[fig5 ] is only due to ( i ) the narrow features at the centers of the subbands because of the atomic - like spectrum of the @xmath150-electrons which are absent in the hubbard model and ( ii ) stronger temperature dependence of dos near the middle of the band because in the 2d f - k model a charge transfer gap opens in the the spectrum at finite temperature .",
    "this phase transition at finite temperature is possible because the order parameter of the charge density wave is ising - like , while in the 2d hubbard model the ordering is forbidden due to the continuous ( rotational ) symmetry of the spin variables .",
    "finally , it is worthwhile to note that the enhancement of the intersite correlations discussed in this work for `` normal '' contractions also takes place for the anomalous means @xmath171,@xcite in which case it leads to a bcs - type superconducting gap equation with the antiferromagnetic intersite correlations playing the role of the pairing interaction ( see the review paper ref .  ) .",
    "this problem will be considered in more detail in a future publication .",
    "as our elementary calculations show , in some cases the gem allows for a reliable calculation of non - local corrections to dmft . in the case of the hubbard model at half filling the corrections are strongly enhanced by spin fluctuations .",
    "we expect that a similar ( though presumably weaker ) enhancement will also take place in the case of small doping . furthermore , from the discussion above , it is seen that the enhancement occurs in the leading non - local correction to the four - point vertex ( last diagram in fig .
