    "<S> in this study , we observe the nonlinear behavior of the two - photon geometric phase for polarization states using time - correlated photons pairs . </S>",
    "<S> this phase manifests as a shift of two - photon interference fringes . under certain arrangements , </S>",
    "<S> the geometric phase can vary nonlinearly and become very sensitive to a change in the polarization state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is known that the geometric phase for @xmath0 identically polarized photons is @xmath0 times larger than that for one photon . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the geometric phase for two photons can become two times more sensitive to a state change . </S>",
    "<S> this high sensitivity to a change in the polarization can be exploited for precision measurement of small polarization variation . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the signal - to - noise ratio of the measurement scheme using the nonlinear behavior of the geometric phase under technical noise and highlight the practical advantages of this scheme . </S>"
