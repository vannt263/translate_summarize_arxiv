    "quantum measurement theory imposes fundamental limitations on the information extractable from a quantum system .",
    "although the evolution of quantum systems can be described deterministically , the measurement operation always leads to nondeterministic outcomes . in order to obtain a desired accuracy , measurement of a particular observable needs to be repeated over an ensemble of identical quantum systems .",
    "in addition , for systems with many degrees of freedom , one usually needs to measure a set of non - commuting observables corresponding to independent parameters of the system .",
    "characterization of state or dynamics of a quantum system can be achieved by a family of methods known as quantum tomography @xcite . in particular",
    ", quantum process tomography provides a general experimental procedure for estimating dynamics of a system which has an unknown interaction with its embedding environment for discrete or continuous degrees of freedom @xcite . in these methods ,",
    "the full information is obtained by a complete set of experimental settings associated with the set of required input states and non - commuting measurements . in recent developments @xcite",
    ", it has been demonstrated that the minimal number of required experimental settings can indeed be substantially reduced by using degrees of freedom of auxiliary quantum systems correlated with the system of interest .",
    "generally it is possible to completely characterize a quantum device with a single experimental setting . a correlated input state of the combined system and an ancilla is subjected to the unknown process , and a generalized measurement or positive operator valued measure ( povm ) is performed at the output @xcite .",
    "however , in order to realize such a generalized measurement one needs to effectively generate many - body interactions @xcite which are not naturally available and/or controllable .",
    "quantum simulation of such many - body interactions is in principle possible , but generally requires an exponentially large number of single- and two - body interactions with respect to system s degrees of freedom .",
    "an alternative method that circumvents the requirement for many - body interactions , yet allows simultaneous non - commuting observables through a single measurement setting , is known as direct characterization of quantum dynamics ( dcqd ) @xcite .",
    "the construction of the full information about the dynamical process is then possible via preparation of a set of mutually unbiased entangled input states over a subspace of the total hilbert space of the principle system and an ancilla @xcite .",
    "the dcqd approach was originally developed with the assumptions of ideal ( i.e. , error - free ) quantum state preparation , measurement , and ancilla channels .",
    "however , in a realistic estimation process , due to decoherence , limited preparation / measurement accuracies , or other imperfections , certain errors may occur hindering the overall procedure .",
    "in this work , we introduce an experimental procedure for using generic two - body interactions to perform quantum process estimation on a subsystem of interest .",
    "we employ this approach to generalize the dcqd scheme to the cases in which the preparations and measurements are realized with known systematic faulty operations .",
    "we demonstrate that in some specific , but physically motivated , noise models , such as the generalized depolarizing channels , only classical correlation between the system and ancilla suffice . moreover , for these situations the data processing overhead is fairly small in comparison to the ideal dcqd . given a noise model , one can find the optimal input states by minimizing the errors incurred through the inversion of experimental data .",
    "thus , we provide the optimal input states for reducing the inversion errors in the noiseless dcqd scheme .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ general ] , we set the framework for process tomography schemes where we have faulty  rather than ideal  faulty bell - state analyzers , emphasizing the dcqd approach .",

    "another similar scenario can also be envisioned .",
    "given two controllable quantum systems @xmath0 and @xmath3 that are made to sufficiently interact before and after a time duration @xmath2 , we wish to estimate the unknown dynamics acting on system @xmath0 for such time interval , assuming the dynamics of the ancilla system @xmath3 and the interaction between two systems is known with a certain accuracy .",
    "much progress has been made in creating and characterizing two - body correlations in a variety of physical systems and interactions , including nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) systems interacting through an ising hamiltonian together with refocusing or dynamical decoupling techniques @xcite , atoms / molecules in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite , trapped ions interacting via the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian driven by laser pulses and vibrational degrees of freedom @xcite , and photons correlated in one or many degrees of freedom , e.g. , generated by parametric - down conversion @xcite or four - wave mixing @xcite .",

    "however , in almost all of these systems , the entangled bell - state preparations and measurements , which generically are the basic building blocks of quantum information processing , hardly achieve high fidelities ; at the very least they are certain to be imperfect at some level , and this will limit their use for tomography . our goal is to determine the optimal states and measurement strategy that will minimize the deleterious effects of the nonidealities  assumed known  on process tomography .
