    "a little over a decade after the discovery of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , reports emerged of a dipole anisotropy in its spatial temperature distribution  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the dipole anisotropy is now widely accepted as a doppler effect arising from the motion of the sun with respect to the cmb rest frame .",
    "measurements by the cosmic background explorer ( cobe )  @xcite , confirmed more recently with wmap , imply a solar system velocity with respect to the cmb of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "efforts to infer the motion of the sun with respect to the local group ( hereafter , lg ) centroid  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) further imply that the lg has a net peculiar velocity in excess of @xmath1  with respect to the rest frame of the cmb , in the direction @xmath2  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the large peculiar velocity of the lg is believed to have been gravitationally induced .",
    "a number of studies have attempted to make a comparison between the lg peculiar velocity inferred from the dipole in the cmb and the velocity reconstructed from inhomogeneities in the local density field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results vary significantly depending on both the source of the survey data as well as the reconstruction technique used .    in reconstructing the velocity from local inhomogeneities , one needs to assume a bias factor to infer the total mass density from the observed one .",
    "for the usual assumption of a linear bias , the predicted magnitude of the reconstructed velocity depends on the value of the bias , while its direction is insensitive to any change in the value of the bias ; therefore a discrepancy in the angle of the reconstructed lg peculiar velocity is of more significance than a discrepancy in the magnitude .",
    "the most recent effort by @xcite predicts a lg velocity @xmath3 from the cmb direction , with an estimated error of @xmath4 ( 95% confidence ) from the reconstruction technique .",
    "there are a number of possible reasons for this large discrepancy .",
    "since the velocity is reconstructed from a survey of galaxies , it is natural to wonder whether the discrepancy arises because of the finite size of the survey . including the error caused by a finite survey volume , as well as the error associated with the reconstruction method , the work of @xcite suggests the dipole directions should agree to within 25@xmath5 at 95% confidence",
    "indeed , there are a number of other possible explanations  from reduced survey completeness in the zone of avoidance , to invalid assumptions in the estimation of mass , to the assumption of linear bias . unfortunately , due to the limitations of the surveys and available data , it is difficult to avoid making assumptions of this kind .",
    "an analysis of each of these postulates is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we focus on the assumption that general relativity ( gr ) is the correct theory of gravity .",
    "this assumption of gr is common to all previous reconstruction efforts .",
    "while gr has been tested to high accuracy on small scales , such as the solar system  @xcite , the constraints coming from cosmological tests are weaker . in this paper",
    "we explore the effects of large - scale modifications of gravity on the reconstruction of the lg peculiar velocity obtained from an analysis of groups of galaxies in the 2mass redshift survey  @xcite .",
    "we consider models of modified gravity and interacting dark energy that serve as alternatives to @xmath6cdm and that modify the growth of perturbations in a time- and scale - dependent manner",
    ". models of modified gravity that predict a scale - independent growth of structure can not modify the direction of the lg peculiar velocity with respect to the gr prediction , since the peculiar velocity toward each attractor would simply be rescaled by a common factor in this case .",
    "however , a scale - dependent modification will change the weight of objects at different distances from the observer , and is therefore expected to rotate the direction .",
    "after generalizing the relationship between the peculiar velocity and density field to allow for modifications of gr and interactions in the dark sector , we study two classes of models that introduce scale - dependent modifications . the first class of models we consider is inspired by scalar - tensor , e.g. @xmath7 , as well as coupled dark energy theories ; generically",

    "efforts to reconstruct the lg dipole from galaxies in 2mass  @xcite and 2mrs  @xcite have produced results that are both inconsistent with the cmb and depend on the reconstruction method .",
    "the relatively recent work by @xcite attempts four different reconstructions for the lg dipole .",
    "while the flux - weighted reconstruction in the lg frame suggests a lg dipole @xmath122 from the cmb result , when performing the reconstruction in the cmb frame , the result increases to @xmath123 .",
    "flux - weighted reconstructions necessarily assume an intrinsic mass - to - light ratio , and therefore do not account for variation in dark - matter bias in clusters compared with isolated galaxies .",
    "the reconstructions using a number - weighted technique in the same paper suggest a lg velocity more than 35@xmath5 from the cmb , and since the majority of distances are estimated from redshifts , the appropriate choice for the reference frame becomes unclear .",
    "the more recent reconstruction from 2mrs by @xcite predicts the lg velocity @xmath3 from the cmb direction at @xmath124 mpc , with an estimated error of @xmath4 ( 95% confidence ) from the reconstruction technique .",
    "it is evident that the assumptions built into the method chosen to reconstruct the lg velocity have a noticeable impact on its direction .",
    "in addition to errors associated with reconstruction methods , there are also errors caused by the finite - size of the survey . assuming a @xmath6cdm cosmology , the amplitude of peculiar velocity fluctuations for a sample complete to 140 mpc is approximately 60  . for a 1@xmath125 fluctuation , given a velocity with respect to the cmb rest frame of @xmath126  , this implies at most a @xmath127 discrepancy for a survey limited to the same radius .",
    "therefore the power on large scales neglected due to the finite survey volume is unlikely to be the reason for the discrepancy in direction .",
    "since the distribution of dark matter drives the inhomogeneities in the density field , we want to use the best available tracers of dark matter to infer mass . while assuming that baryonic matter traces dark matter provides a reasonable starting point , to further assume that the mass of baryonic matter is proportional to the mass of dark matter ignores any differences between dark matter in isolated galaxies or small groups and massive galaxy clusters .",
    "to avoid making this assumption , we will use dynamical mass estimates obtained from galaxy groups : we use the catalog of galaxy groups derived from 2mrs  @xcite as the basis for our reconstruction .",
    "two catalogs of groups , constructed using a variable - linking - length percolation algorithm , are presented in the aforementioned work ; in this paper , we use groups from the revised 2mrs hdc catalog ( constructed with a minimum density contrast @xmath128 ) ; the reason for this choice is that these groups are less prone to interloper contamination than the alternative ( ldc ) catalog ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and we therefore expect the dynamical mass estimates to be more robust .",
    "this choice , however , comes at the expense of missing some member - galaxies .",
    "the catalog of groups is truncated at a distance of 140 mpc , where the number of galaxies in the 2mrs @xmath120 catalog between radii @xmath129 and @xmath130 falls to half its maximum value .",
    "the method we use to reconstruct the lg peculiar velocity is discussed below .    in this work",
    "we make an effort to reduce and optimize the assumptions in the reconstruction method .",
    "however , the purpose of this work is to understand the effect of modified gravity on the reconstructed lg peculiar velocity . and , while choosing a different method , with different assumptions , will undoubtedly change the direction of the reconstructed dipole , the conclusions presented in this paper are robust , and can be reproduced using the alternative number - weighted reconstruction technique utilized by @xcite .",
    "since no algorithm to identify groups using only 3 components of phase - space information can guarantee finding virialized groups , we have to understand the limitations of the data .",
    "while the algorithm used to construct the 2mrs hdc catalog has been tested and optimized using simulations ( e.g , @xcite ) , the groups are still susceptible to interloper contamination .    by examining the sky - distributions and velocity dispersions of the members of the groups with the largest contributions to the lg acceleration",

    "2 .   in the group catalog , the nearby m94 group ( @xmath138  ) has been merged with both the m106 group ( @xmath139  ) and the ursa major group ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "we manually separate this group as follows : we consider those galaxies inside an ellipse ( @xmath141 , @xmath142 , with the semimajor axis inclined 60@xmath5 from north toward east ) centered on ( @xmath131=12@xmath13240@xmath133 , @xmath134=41@xmath5 ) ; those with heliocentric redshifts below 400  are assigned to the m94 group , and those with redshifts between 400 and 700  are assigned to the m106 group .",
    "the remaining galaxies now appear visually as 3 distinct groups : those inside the ellipse ( @xmath143 , @xmath144 , with the semimajor axis inclined 70@xmath5 from north toward west ) centered on ( @xmath131=12@xmath13224@xmath133 , @xmath134=29@xmath5 ) are split into two groups , with heliocentric redshifts above and below 900  .",
    "those outside the ellipse comprise the ursa major group .",
    "the estimated distances to and masses of the groups are then recomputed using the updated list of members .      the 2mrs hdc group catalog ( see sec . [",
    "sec : data ] above ) is a powerful tool for reconstructing the lg peculiar velocity .",
    "however , since we are dealing with a catalog constructed from observational data , we must be careful to avoid its caveats .",
    "the catalog was constructed using a variable linking - length percolation algorithm , based on that of  @xcite , in an effort to prevent an artificial reduction in the number of groups identified at large distances .",
    "the resulting selection function of the group catalog will therefore differ from that of 2mrs . in our analysis",

    "we further assume that mass concentrations are point - like and located at the distances specified in the catalog : @xmath148 .",
    "therefore from eq.([vel__real_1 ] ) the resulting velocity vector of the lg ( which we define to be located at the origin ) today is given by @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the effective mass ( see below ) of the @xmath151 group , located at distance @xmath152  , the difference between physical and comoving distances is smaller than the errors on the estimated distances to groups . as such",

    "since we are using data drawn from a magnitude - limited survey , the data are subject to the selection bias of the sample ( i.e. fewer galaxies are observed per unit volume at larger redshifts ) .",
    "since the sample is restricted to small redshifts , we expect that the intrinsic mean mass density does not vary with position , however the mass density we infer by estimating the masses of observed groups will inevitably decrease with redshift . in an effort to reduce the impact of the selection bias on our results",

    "but the dipole appears to have converged by 120 mpc , some 46@xmath5 from the cmb dipole . to assess the propagation of errors from the mass and distance estimates we use a monte carlo technique , assuming gaussian errors of 10% on the distance to the group , in addition to a poisson error for the dynamical mass estimate",

    "it is important to be aware that the conclusions presented below will not change if constructed using an alternative source catalog ( e.g. galaxy - based sample ) since the general form of the contributions toward the lg peculiar velocity remains the same .",
    "armed with this insight , we now turn to discuss the effect of modified gravity on the lg peculiar velocity . with a lg dipole under gr",
    "directed @xmath183 away from the cmb expectation , it is clear that modified gravity must be able to rotate the direction through an angle of this order of magnitude to provide a solution to the problem .      using the scalar - tensor parametrization shown in eq .",

    "[ fig : ang_yukawa ] , we plot the angular deviation of the reconstructed lg velocity from the gr result for this class of models ; the amplitude of the reconstructed velocity , relative to the gr case , is plotted in figure [ fig : mag_yukawa ] . from figure",
    "[ fig : ang_yukawa ] , it is evident that the maximal angular deviation is @xmath187 , which is significantly smaller than the @xmath188 needed to align the lg velocity with the direction inferred from the cmb dipole .",
    "the parameters @xmath63 , @xmath185 , and @xmath65 have different effects on the velocity dipole .",
    "the parameter @xmath63 changes the time at which modified gravity becomes dominant . for larger values of @xmath63 ,",
    "modified gravity becomes relevant at later times , leading to smaller deviations from gr .",
    "larger @xmath63 also shifts the features in figures [ fig : ang_yukawa ] and [ fig : mag_yukawa ] to larger values of @xmath88 since a yukawa coupling which acts over a larger range compensates for the smaller time duration over which modified gravity is relevant . in order to understand the effects of @xmath65 and @xmath185 ,",
    "let us look at the green s function  ( [ gv_bz ] ) derived analytically .",
    "as discussed previously , the approximation we have used in deriving  ( [ gv_bz ] ) works well for values of @xmath85 ( and on large scales for @xmath87 ) and is useful for interpreting the numerical results .",
    "consider the deviation caused by modified gravity defined as the fractional difference in the magnitude of the velocity , @xmath189 and assume @xmath63 is fixed .",
    "looking at the approximate green s function  ( eq . [ gv_bz ] ) , we see that @xmath190 sets the transition scale between two asymptotic behaviors : @xmath191 for @xmath192 and @xmath193 for @xmath194 .",
    "hence , calculating the lg peculiar velocity effectively becomes a weighted average , with the contribution of a mass to the lg peculiar velocity weighted by @xmath195 for @xmath196 , and by @xmath197 for @xmath198 ; both weights are relative to the predicted gr contribution . since @xmath75 , changing @xmath65 changes the scale at which the shift in weighting occurs and changing @xmath185 changes the weighting itself .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath199 determines whether the contribution to the lg peculiar velocity from galaxy groups on scales @xmath200 is smaller or larger than the gr case . in the case of @xmath201 ,",
    "the change in direction brings the lg dipole closer to the cmb  implied direction , whereas in the case of @xmath202 , the shift is away from the cmb dipole .",
    "since the amplitude of the change in angle is significantly less than the error on the reconstruction , we can not draw any conclusions from this observation . since our sample probes @xmath203 mpc @xmath204 mpc , the above analytically computed limits for @xmath205 are roughly reproduced in figure [ fig : mag_yukawa ] for @xmath85 . for @xmath87 , the analytic limit for @xmath206 does not match the numerical result since the approximation breaks down .",
    "figure [ fig : ang_yukawa ] shows that the maximal angular deviation from the gr reconstructed dipole occurs for @xmath88 in the range 2040 mpc ( for @xmath90 ) and 3050 mpc ( for @xmath207 ) , depending on the choice of @xmath185 .",
    "this maximum deviation is @xmath20823@xmath209 , significantly less than the @xmath20840@xmath210 required to explain the discrepancy with the cmb .",
    "the angular deviation goes to zero at the endpoints of the domain since the dipole direction is insensitive to a constant rescaling of all velocities .",
    "the value of @xmath190 at which figure [ fig : ang_yukawa ] peaks , however , depends on the distribution of galaxies .",
    "this is analyzed below by reconstructing the lg peculiar velocity using only groups inside concentric spheres of increasing radii , which is shown in figure [ fig : convergence_yukawa ] .",
    "this allows us to identify which groups drive the amplitude and direction of the peculiar velocity , and how this changes under specific cases of the yukawa - type . in what follows",
    ", we specialize to the parameter values used for figure [ fig : convergence_yukawa ] and discuss the details of the plots .",
    "the left panel shows the lg peculiar velocity for @xmath89 ( _ repulsive _ yukawa ) , @xmath90 , and @xmath211 and 100 mpc . for @xmath211 mpc , the contribution to the peculiar velocity from the groups inside 30 mpc ( dominated by the m94 and ursa major groups , and the virgo cluster )",
    "is significantly reduced compared to the gr case ( since @xmath202 ) , and the influence of groups beyond @xmath212 ( most notably centaurus , perseus - pisces and norma ) are dampened when compared with gr .",
    "as such , the relative contribution of centaurus is less than in gr , so we do nt see the negative shift in @xmath176 or positive shift in @xmath177 at a distance @xmath213 mpc . at very large distances , the increased weighting of the groups , and",
    "larger volume of the concentric shells , means the contribution to the peculiar velocity from masses within the shell is very sensitive to the distribution of mass , and a departure from gr is expected .",
    "however , the amplitude of the contribution to the peculiar velocity from these shells is not sufficient to significantly alter the direction of the dipole .",
    "since the inner groups dominate the contribution toward the galactic pole , the net result is a small shift in the direction toward the galactic plane , bringing the lg dipole @xmath214 farther from the direction expected from the cmb . for @xmath215 ,",
    "the transition scale is close to the limit of the survey .",
    "the resulting peculiar velocity therefore follows the gr result , reduced in amplitude by a constant factor , up to the transition scale .",
    "since the dipole has converged by @xmath216 mpc , there is little angular difference from the gr result .",
    "hence , while the amplitude of the lg velocity is reduced , the angle remains consistent with gr to @xmath217 .",
    "the right panel shows the case of @xmath218 ( _ attractive _ yukawa ) , @xmath90 , and @xmath211 and 100 mpc .",
    "we see the reverse of the above scenario . since @xmath201 , the contribution to the peculiar velocity of groups inside @xmath88 is amplified .",
    "hence for @xmath219 , the increased contributions from the nearby m94 and ursa major groups and the virgo cluster increase the @xmath173component of the velocity over the gr result . for @xmath215 , the contribution from all groups",
    "is amplified and the graph follows the gr result up to @xmath220 mpc , after which the relative contributions of more distant groups is suppressed , most significantly  the coma cluster  which dampens the jump in positive @xmath173 .",
    "the groups beyond 100 mpc have large effective masses ( due to the correction for the selection bias ) , and one would expect that changing the weighting of these groups via modified gravity , would have significant impact on the reconstructed velocity",
    ". however this effect competes with the isotropy on these scales ; indeed , changing the weighting of an isotropic distribution can not alter the direction of the dipole .",
    "hence the effect of modified gravity on the contribution toward the lg peculiar velocity from the distant groups is somewhat suppressed .      using the parametrization shown in eq .",

    "the detailed analysis of figure [ fig : convergence_yukawa ] in the previous subsection , can be reapplied to figure [ fig : convergence_degrav ] .",
    "when considering values of @xmath99 close to the distance of the virgo cluster , the relative suppression of more distant groups shifts the lg peculiar velocity towards virgo , and also slightly closer to the cmb  implied direction . for @xmath111 mpc ,",
    "all galaxy groups satisfy @xmath243 and so the lg peculiar velocity is simply amplified by @xmath244 with negligible change in the direction .",
    "note once again that since the amplitude of the change in angle is significantly less than the error on the reconstruction , there is little insight to be gained from the direction of the change .",
    "as expected , the scale - dependent modifications to the poisson s equation ( [ poisson ] ) rotate the direction of the reconstructed lg peculiar velocity .",
    "however , for the broad set of models with realistic parameter choices that we have considered , the change in direction with respect to the standard gr result is of the order of a few degrees , which is significantly smaller than the @xmath245 needed to align the lg velocity with the cmb dipole .    from the analysis it is clear that , if there were a large undetected mass either inside or outside the survey volume , which could rotate the dipole in the right direction , modified gravity models would still predict a direction for the lg peculiar velocity within a few degrees of the gr prediction .",
    "in other words , modified gravity would not be significantly more efficient than gr in solving the angular discrepancy .    from figures [ fig : mag_yukawa ] and [ fig : mag_degrav ] ,",
    "it is clear that for reasonable parameter choices , the magnitude of the lg peculiar velocity differs at most by a factor of @xmath246 from the gr result . since there are several uncertainties , like the bias , which are used to determine the magnitude of the lg peculiar velocity , we can not discount modified gravity on the basis of the magnitude of the reconstructed velocity alone .",
    "in other words , we can always find a parameter @xmath145 of order unity that will allow the peculiar velocity of the lg to equal the magnitude of the peculiar velocity inferred from the cmb dipole .",
    "the peculiar velocity of the local group , reconstructed from inhomogeneities in the density field , does not agree with the velocity inferred from the dipole anisotropy in the cmb .",
    "using the hdc catalog of galaxy groups  @xcite constructed from 2mrs  @xcite , we investigated , with both numerical and analytical methods , whether allowing for modifications of gravity on large scales , or interactions in the dark sector , can alleviate this discrepancy . using an approximate expression for the growth factor",
    ", we have derived a general analytical formalism that relates peculiar velocities in real space to matter overdensities .",
    "this formalism applies to generalized theories of gravity that reproduce gr at early times and predict a modified poisson equation on sub - horizon scales ( eq .  [ poisson ] ) .",
    "moreover , it reproduces numerical results for a broad range of parameter values .",
    "we have then specialized to two broad classes of models , representing the main approaches to the phenomenon of cosmic acceleration , and reconstructed the corresponding lg peculiar velocity .",
    "the models we have chosen have the common feature of introducing scale - dependent modifications to the growth of perturbations , and therefore have the potential of rotating the direction of the peculiar velocity .",
    "specifically , we have considered scalar - tensor theories and models of dark energy coupled to dark matter as well as higher - dimensional gravity  @xcite . for reasonable values of each model s parameters",
    ", we find that the direction of the lg peculiar velocity changes by at most @xmath247 with respect to the standard gr result . this angle is much less than the required @xmath245 to coincide with the direction of the lg dipole inferred from the cmb .    the inability to reconcile the direction of the lg peculiar velocity with the cmb dipole , under either @xmath6cdm or modified gravity , continues to raise numerous questions .",
    "the selection - bias of magnitude - limited surveys prevents us from detecting all luminous matter inside the limiting survey volume ; however , increasing the magnitude limit in 2mrs does not significantly increase the galaxy count inside 7000  ; moreover , since we considered galaxy groups , we expect to have included the most massive structures inside 140 mpc in our analysis .",
    "furthermore , while previous efforts have relied upon assumptions about the masses of galaxies , we have used masses estimated dynamically from galaxy group members , and therefore have indirectly accounted for dark matter interior to the observed galaxies in clusters .    even though 2mass samples galaxies at very low galactic latitudes , it is possible that we have missed a massive contribution to the lg velocity located very close to the galactic plane . while an as - yet undetected contribution to the lg velocity ( e.g. , a poorly sampled , distant , massive supercluster , or  as suggested by  @xcite  a nearby galaxy masked by the galactic plane ) could reconcile the issue",
    ", we find that gr and modified gravity are expected to give directions for the lg velocity that are within a few degrees of each other .",
    "a modification of the laws of interaction would therefore not play a key role if this was the case .    on the other hand ,",
    "the significant discrepancy between the two dipoles leads us to question the assumptions that are built into the reconstruction . in this and previous work",
    ", it is assumed that the luminous matter traces the dark matter . while we have attempted to estimate the cluster masses dynamically ( using luminous matter as tracers ) , we can only estimate interior mass .",
    "our assumption of linear bias implies that the estimated cluster mass is proportional to the dark matter mass , and that this constant of proportionality does not depend on the properties of the cluster , or on redshift , which may not be a valid assumption .",
    "we have shown that changing the scale - dependence of the growth of perturbations does alter the reconstructed direction of the lg dipole , although not in an amount sufficient to explain the discrepancy with the cmb .",
    "while we have assumed a linear bias between visible and dark matter , a scale - dependent bias might have a similar effect to that of modified gravity discussed above , but subject to different observational constraints .",
    "it is evident that a scale - dependence in the bias parameter will alter the direction of the reconstructed lg velocity ; however , from our analysis , we can not conclude whether or not realistic models of scale - dependence in the bias could account for the angular discrepancy .",
    "an alternative explanation is a limit in our understanding of cosmology . in a @xmath6cdm universe",
    ", we expect that the motions of galaxies ( and clusters of galaxies ) merge with the hubble flow at @xmath248 mpc scales .",
    "however measurements of the power asymmetry in the cmb  @xcite and of bulk flows  @xcite , suggest an inhomogeneous distribution of matter on much larger scales .",
    "this large - scale power , while inconsistent with @xmath6cdm , could explain the discrepancy between dipoles .",
    "indeed , the dipole reconstructed from local inhomogeneities assuming gr , in conjunction with a bulk flow in the direction suggested by both @xcite and @xcite , can result in a net flow in agreement , within the estimated errors , with the direction observed in the cmb ( with an appropriate choice for the bias parameter ) .",
    "further discussion on this subject , however , is beyond the scope of this work ( see  @xcite for a detailed analysis ) .",
    "peculiar velocities probe the matter density on a wide range of scales , and thus present a unique test of gravity on large sub - horizon scales .",
    "while the effect of modified gravity on the lg peculiar velocity is minimal , studying the impact of modified gravity on the local flow - field could potentially act as a more distinguishing test of gravity .",
    "further study on this subject would be highly insightful , but is , once again , beyond the scope of this work .",
    "while in this work we can not deduce the correct explanation for the discrepancy between the peculiar velocity of the lg induced by inhomogeneities in the density field and the velocity expected from the dipole in the cmb , we have demonstrated that modified theories of gravity alone can not provide a solution to this problem .",
