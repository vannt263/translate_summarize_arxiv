    "dimer models , i.e. , bipartite graphs embedded in an orientable surface which admit perfect matchings , appeared in the 1930s as statistical models for the absorption of di - atomic molecules ( dimers ) on a crystal surface . about a decade and",
    "a half ago it was observed that dimer models have vast applications within mirror symmetry and string theory . in particular ,",
    "dimer models embedded in the real two - torus @xmath1 are related to brane tilings of toric singular calabi ",
    "yau threefolds , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "let @xmath2 be a dimer model .",
    "we can form the kasteleyn matrix ( or weighted adjacency matrix ) associated with @xmath3 , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "its determinant , which is a bivariate polynomial , is known as the characteristic polynomial of @xmath3 , and its newton polygon @xmath4 is known as the characteristic polygon of @xmath3 . in the physics literature , the characteristic polygon",
    "is called the toric diagram , see @xcite .",
    "the inverse problem , to construct a dimer model with a prescribed characteristic polygon @xmath4 , has been addressed in a number of articles .",
    "the first proposed solution , now known as the hanany  vegh algorithm , assumed the existence of an oriented _ admissible _ hyperplane arrangement on @xmath1 _ dual _ to the polygon @xmath4 @xcite , see  [ sec : graphs ] for definitions .",
    "an alternative algorithm not subject to any additional assumptions has been given by gulotta @xcite .",
    "the present work has its origin in a series of papers by futaki ",
    "ueda and ueda ",
    "yamzaki @xcite , who study three polygons @xmath4 in detail : the unit simplex , the unit square , and one special polygon with five vertices ( the case @xmath5 in example  [ ex : hananyveghexample ] ) .",
    "their main observation was that _ in these three examples _ the admissible hyperplane arrangement can be taken as the shell @xmath6 of the coamoeba @xmath7 of the characteristic polynomial of @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the dimer model @xmath3 can be realized as a deformation retract of the coamoeba @xmath7 .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to explain the relationship between the dimer model @xmath3 and the coamoeba @xmath7 .",
    "as is common in the amoeba literature , we take the approach of gelfand , kapranov , and zelevinsky @xcite and study a family of polynomials with fixed support whose newton polygon is @xmath4 .    in general",
    ", the shell @xmath6 of the coamoeba @xmath8 is not an admissible hyperplane arrangement .",
    "even worse , we provide a polygon which does not admit any dual admissible hyperplane arrangement , see example [ ex : hananyveghexample ] .",
    "this settles a question arising from @xcite .",
    "one point of this article is that the notion of admissibility is a red herring .",

    "this algorithm is equivalent to an algorithm set forward by stienstra @xcite , but is formulated in terms of the index map @xmath17 .",
    "the justification for why we rewrite stienstra s algorithm in this manner , is that we need to be able to handle the case set forward in theorem [ thm : shellvolp2 ] .",
    "the reader familiar with yang  baxter modifications ( see  [ ssec : yangbaxter ] ) will realize that the moral of theorem  [ thm : shellvolp2 ] is that rather than requiring @xmath6 to be an admissible arragnement , we should require that @xmath6 has the correct number of cells of index zero .",
