    "the phase of an electromagnetic field can not be measured directly using linear optics and photodetectors . rather than measuring phase directly ,",
    "phase measurement schemes rely on measuring quadratures of the field and inferring the phase from these measurements . in a typical experimental implementation",
    ", the mode to be measured is passed through a 50/50 beam splitter , in order to combine it with a much stronger local oscillator field .",
    "the difference photocurrent from the two output ports of the beam splitter yields a measurement of a particular quadrature .",
    "the standard technique for measuring a completely unknown phase is heterodyne detection , where all quadratures are sampled with equal probability .",
    "this is achieved by using a local oscillator field with a frequency slightly different from the signal s frequency , so its phase changes linearly with respect to the phase of the signal .",
    "more accurate phase measurements can be made using the homodyne technique , where the local oscillator phase is @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the phase of the signal .",
    "the problem with this is that it requires initial knowledge of the phase of the signal , and so is not a phase measurement in the strict sense .    to maintain the unbiased nature of heterodyne phase measurements but obtain the increased sensitivity of homodyne measurements ,",
    "an adaptive dyne technique can be used @xcite . here",
    "`` dyne '' detection is used to mean photodetection using a strong local oscillator at a beam splitter .",
    "the idea behind adaptive phase measurement schemes is to use the information gained so far during the measurement to estimate the system phase @xmath5 .",
    "this is then used to adjust the local oscillator phase @xmath6 to approximate a homodyne measurement as above .    the apparatus for performing these measurements is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ apparatus ] . the signal and a local oscillator with amplitude @xmath7",
    "are combined at the beam splitter and the outputs are measured with photodetectors .",
    "the outputs from the photodetectors , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are subtracted and then fed into a digital signal processor that uses these measurements to estimate the phase of the system , and adjusts the phase of the local oscillator via an electro - optic phase modulator .",
    "the signal is shown here as from a cavity with a half - silvered mirror , as this is what is considered in the theory in sec .",
    "[ method ] .",
    "the signal of interest is the difference between the photocurrents at the two ports .",
    "we therefore define the signal as @xmath10 here we have used units of time such that the decay constant of the cavity is unity .",
    "we divide by a factor of @xmath11 because this is the square root of the mode function for the signal",
    ". we can take account of signals with more general mode functions @xmath12 in a similar way @xcite .",

    "these are @xmath20 for convenience , we often replace @xmath21 by a third complex number defined in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath21 , @xmath23 generally the best estimate of the phase at time @xmath15 is @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the subscripts are omitted for the final values ( @xmath25 ) .    in adaptive measurement schemes the phase of the local oscillator",

    "there are a number of possible phase estimates , giving different adaptive schemes .",
    "for the mark i scheme @xcite , both the running phase estimate @xmath27 and the final phase estimate are taken to be @xmath29 .",
    "this is better than heterodyne measurements only if the field is very weak @xcite . for the mark",

    "@xmath21 does not vanish and @xmath29 is generally a much worse phase estimate than @xmath24 .",
    "this raises the question of why this relatively poor intermediate phase estimate is used .",
    "there are two main reasons for this : ( i ) it is possible to obtain direct analytic results for this case , whereas using a better intermediate phase estimate requires numerical evaluation ; ( ii ) the apparatus required to implement this method is much simpler than that required for a better intermediate phase estimate .",

    "this is far smaller than the introduced phase variance , so the latter is what limits the accuracy of phase measurements . although the mark ii results are far superior to the standard result of heterodyne detection , it is still possible to improve on the mark ii result , and it is shown in ref .",

    "it turns out that using the best phase estimate @xmath32 actually gives a worse result than the mark ii case , for reasons that we will explain later .",
    "the phase estimates that we consider in this paper are therefore intermediate between @xmath31 and the best phase estimate : @xmath39 it is possible to obtain a marked improvement over the mark ii case by using constant values of @xmath40 .",

    "this method works best if the phase estimates are updated in discrete time steps , and the magnitude of the steps depends weakly on the photon number .",
    "a more serious problem with this method is that it tends to produce values of @xmath43 that are too close to 1 .",

    "the maximum overlap between the states will be when the squeezed state has about the same photon number as the input state .",
    "this means that the theoretical limit to the phase variance that is introduced by the measurement is the phase variance of the squeezed state that has the same photon number as the input state and has been optimized for minimum intrinsic phase variance .",

    "this indicates that the results are following a different scaling law , and fitting techniques give the power for the introduced phase variance as @xmath152 . the data and the fitted line along with the heterodyne and mark ii cases and the theoretical limit are shown in fig  [ constant ] .",
    "these results are a significant improvement over the mark ii case , but are still significantly above the theoretical limit .    in order to improve on this result we must vary @xmath40 during the measurement .",

    "recall that during the measurement we want the phase estimate to be between the phase of @xmath16 and the phase of @xmath109 .",
    "we only have an estimate of the phase of @xmath81 ( the initial phase ) , so if we use a phase estimate that is too close to the actual phase when the phase variance of @xmath16 is large , the phase estimate is likely to be outside the interval between the phase of @xmath16 and the phase of @xmath109 .",
    "since the phase variance of @xmath16 increases with time , the value of @xmath40 is increased as well , to prevent this happening .",

    "as this shows , the results are very close to the theoretical limit , and even for the largest photon number for which calculations have been performed the phase uncertainty is only about 4% above the theoretical limit . for these calculations the time steps used were approximately @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the theoretical limit to the phase uncertainty . with these time steps the uncertainty due to",
    "the finite step size is approximately 1% .",
    "if the integration time step is reduced , while keeping the time interval at which the phase estimates are updated constant , the phase variance converges . if , however , the phase estimates are updated at smaller and smaller time intervals then the phase variance does not converge .",
    "for example , the phase uncertainty for measurements on an optimized squeezed state with a photon number of 1577 is @xmath159 if we use the time steps given above . if , however , we use time steps that are 100 times smaller , then the phase variance is @xmath160 , and if the time steps are 1000 times smaller the phase variance is @xmath161 .",
    "these results indicate that the phase estimates must be incremented in finite time intervals for this method to give good results , and the size of the time steps that should be used depends on the photon number .",
    "the phase variance is not strongly dependent on these time steps , however , and only an order of magnitude estimate of the photon number is required .",
    "a problem with determing the phase variance by the method above is that , for highly squeezed states ( that are close to optimized for minimum phase variance ) , a significant contribution to the phase variance is from low probability results around @xmath44 . in obtaining numerical results the actual phase variance for the measurement will tend to be underestimated because the results from around @xmath44 are obtained too rarely for good statistics .",
    "it would require an extremely large number of samples to estimate this contribution .",
    "however , we can estimate it nonstatistically as follows",
    ".    recall that in order to have a measurement that is close to optimum the multiplying factor @xmath80 should give values of @xmath74 for each @xmath72 that are close to optimized for minimum phase uncertainty . to test this for the phase measurement scheme described above",
    ", the @xmath72 and @xmath74 were determined from the values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 from the samples .",
    "the resulting data along with the line for optimized @xmath74 are plotted in fig .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath74 should be zero for optimum measurements , and is small for these results .",
    "therefore in fig .",

    "the variation of @xmath74 with @xmath72 for optimum squeezed states is also plotted ( continuous line).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    first we consider the effect of variations in the modulus of @xmath74 , leaving consideration of error in the phase till later . in order to estimate how far above the theoretical limit the actual phase variance is , we make a quadratic approximation to the expression for the phase variance . from @xcite",
    "the expression for the phase variance of a squeezed state is , for real @xmath74 , @xmath163 taking the derivative with respect to @xmath74 gives @xmath164 taking the second derivative and using the fact that the expression above is zero for minimum phase variance gives @xmath165 this means that for values of @xmath74 close to optimum the increase in the phase variance over the optimum value is @xmath166 the main contribution to the phase uncertainty is @xmath167 , so the increase in the phase uncertainty as a ratio to the minimum phase uncertainty is @xmath168 this estimate indicates that the actual phase variance for the measurement scheme described above can be significantly larger than the intrinsic phase variance .",
    "for example , for a mean photon number of about 332@xmath169000 the rms    deviation of @xmath170 from the optimum value is only about 0.16 , but a squeezed state with @xmath170 differing this much from optimum will have a phase variance more than twice the optimum value .",
    "this indicates that if the low probability results around @xmath44 are taken into account the introduced phase variance is actually more than twice the theoretical limit .",
    "next , we estimate the contribution from error in the phase ( rather than the modulus ) of @xmath74 . for a squeezed state with real @xmath79",
    "the intrinsic uncertainty in the zero quadrature is @xmath171 where @xmath172 .",
    "since @xmath173 , the intrinsic uncertainty in the phase is @xmath174 if the phase of @xmath74 is small , we can make the approximation @xmath175 clearly the first term in the numerator is just the original phase variance , and the second term is the excess phase variance due to the error in the phase of @xmath74 .",
    "therefore the extra phase variance due to error in the phase of @xmath74 is given by @xmath176    using this estimate on the previous example it can be seen that this is not so much of a problem , with the introduced phase uncertainty being increased by less than 3% by this factor .",
    "the problem of the large contribution of the low probability results around @xmath44 can be effectively eliminated in the following way . at each time",

    "means that the alternative feedback is used only toward the end of the measurement . only considering the alternative feedback in the last 10% of the measurement is necessary for the smaller photon numbers , where eq .",
    "( [ toohi ] ) is too weak a restriction .",
    "another variation from the previous scheme is that , for the larger photon numbers , the values of @xmath40 given by the original expression were reduced .",

    "the introduced phase variance can not be reduced below @xcite @xmath197 when the mark ii phase variance is less than this there is not likely to be any significant advantage to using a more advanced feedback scheme . for the best photodetectors available today , with around 98% efficiency @xcite , the mark",
    "ii phase variance falls below this limit for photon numbers above 1000 . below this photon number the mark",
    "ii phase variance is never more than about 27% above the limits determined using eqs .",
    "( [ fund ] ) and ( [ effic ] ) , so only relatively small improvements can be obtained by using a more advanced feedback scheme .",
    "nevertheless , the technology is always improving , and there is no fundamental reason why photodetectors can not be built with efficiencies extremely close to 1 @xcite .",
    "when very efficient photodetectors are developed , the feedback techniques described here have the potential to give great improvements in the accuracy of phase measurements for applications where there is a limitation on the photon number that can be used .",
    "the other detrimental factors are relatively minor , although the time delay in the feedback loop will become significant for very short pulses .",
    "the primary significance of the result obtained in this paper is theoretical , however , as it represents the culmination of the search for the best optical phase measurement schemes using standard devices .",
    "to do any better would require using nonlinear optical devices .",
    "for example , it is conceivable that down - converting some portion of the signal field , and then measuring the phase of the down - converted light , could enable the above theoretical limit to be surpassed .",
    "this is a question for future work .",
