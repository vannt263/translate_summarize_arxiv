    "understanding the spectral correlations present in a correlated photon pair source is extremely important in determining whether that source is suitable for various quantum interference and quantum information processing schemes .",
    "for instance , a photon pair whose signal and idler photons are spectrally - uncorrelated may work well as a heralded source @xcite , but be unsuitable for applications where spectral entanglement is required , such as quantum - enhanced optical coherence tomography @xcite , or high - dimensional quantum key distribution @xcite .    however , traditional measurements of the joint spectrum of a biphoton require the use of expensive and lossy spectrometers , involving long integration times to produce significant coincidence counts .",
    "the integration times are increased when the resolution required is finer .",
    "recent progress in so - called ` stimulated ' emission tomography @xcite has shown that the joint spectrum can be predicted accurately by performing classical nonlinear frequency - mixing . in practice @xcite ,",
    "though , this form of tomography requires complete knowledge of and access to the nonlinear generation process ( which will not be the case if the source is embedded or packaged in a commercial system ) .    another way to approach",
    "the problem is to map the spectral information of the jsi onto the temporal domain , using a dispersive medium , so that the spectral information is now encoded in the arrival times of the signal and idler photons at their respective detectors .",
    "when the dispersive medium is a long spool of fiber , this is called the fiber spectrometer method @xcite .",
    "however , the fiber spectrometer requires accurate dispersion calibration that is specific to the actual fiber spool in use . in @xcite , for example , the fiber dispersion is calibrated beforehand with a short - pulse tunable laser .",
    "this must be done before every experiment , as the temperature changes in corning smf-28 fiber , say , can result in a change of group delay by 40 ps / km / k @xcite , or 4 ns over 20 km of fiber for a 5 k temperature variation . in this work , we demonstrate experimentally that such _ a priori _ calibration is unnecessary , especially if we wish to measure a biphoton joint spectrum that is broadband . by using multiple frequency - conjugate filters that have sharp cut - on and cut - off wavelengths , the broadband spectrum we obtain a new way to elucidate the dispersion of the fiber spool .",
    "this is because the sharp edges of the filter can now act as spectral markers , allowing us to simultaneously gauge the fiber spool s dispersion while obtaining the joint spectrum of the biphoton s jsi .",
    "additionally , the use of the filters limits the temporal extent of the downconverted biphotons , so that a relatively high - repetition rate pump ( ti : sapphire laser , 81.6 mhz , 12.25 ns period ) can be used without the downconverted biphotons spanning more than one period , which could cause complications experimentally .",
    "the breakdown of this paper is as flows . in section 2 , the idea of the fiber spectrometer",
    "will be explained mathematically . using downconverted photon pairs generated from a poled optical fiber @xcite and various top - hat sharp - edge filters",
    ", we will demonstrate our method to measure the dispersion of the fiber spool in section 3 .",
    "finally , in section 4 , the fiber spectrometer method will be used to measure the downconversion spectrum of the poled optical fiber .",
    "conveniently , the downconverted photon pairs generated have wavelengths symmetric about @xmath11550 nm .",
    "consider a biphoton generated from spdc .",
    "both photons are created at the same time and will also exit the nonlinear medium simultaneously ; in this case , ` simultaneous ' shall mean within the detector response time ( 120 ps full width at half maximum [ fwhm ] ) .",
    "let us describe this biphoton as a function of wavelength : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the average number of photon pairs in the wavepacket , and @xmath4 is the spectral brightness ( photon pairs per unit wavelength of signal and idler , [ pairs / nm@xmath5 ) .",
    "now , let this biphoton propagate through a fiber spool of length @xmath6 whose dispersion is given by the @xmath7-parameter @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath10 is the fiber propagation constant .",
    "the fiber is single - mode at the wavelengths of the downconverted photon pairs .",
    "we now exploit the fact that single photons travel at the group velocity @xcite to develop the fiber spectrometer idea further .",
    "the spectral information of the biphoton will then be mapped onto the temporal domain : @xmath11 where we have explicitly stated that the arrival time @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) of the signal ( idler ) is a function of its wavelength @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "it is a simple matter , then , to relate @xmath16 ( eq . [ eq : biphottime ] ) to @xmath17 ( eq . [ eq : biphotonn ] ) . noting that the arrival time is defined as @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the group velocity inside the fiber spool ) and that @xmath20 we have the equality : @xmath21 in our case , this spectral - to - temporal mapping is one - to - one because the downconverted photons generated from the poled fiber have wavelengths that lie only in the anomalously dispersive region of the fiber spool used ( smf-28 ) .",
    "note that while @xmath22 is effectively the group - velocity dispersion ( gvd ) of the fiber spool , it encapsulates higher - order dispersion terms of the spool as well .",
    "experimentally , an actively - modelocked ti : sapphire laser with an 81.6 mhz pulsetrain and 400-ps fwhm pulses pumps a periodically - poled fiber to generate an ensemble of biphotons . fig .",
    "[ fig : fiberspectromprelimsetup ] shows an outline of the experimental setup .",
    "the signal photons ( shorter wavelength ) are separated from the idler photons ( longer wavelength ) using coarse wavelength - division demultiplexers ( demux ) ; the bandwidths of such coarse filters range from 16 nm to 40 nm ( see fig . [",
    "fig : jsa_filtersets ] ) .",
    "free - running spds , the i d quantique id220 devices , are used to measure the photons .",
    "the arrival times of the signal and idler photons at the spds are measured with respect to the sync signal of the ti : sapph with the commercial time - interval analyzer ( picoquant hydraharp 400 ) .",
    "a two - dimensional histogram is constructed from the detector clicks and ti : sapph sync signal .",
    "a schematic for the process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematict3mode ] .",
    "equation [ eq : t_stod ] allows us to relate the temporal resolution to the differential wavelength resolution @xmath23 .",
    "the minimal resolution @xmath24 is dictated by the jitter of the sync pulse ( @xmath25 ) , the pump pulsewidth ( @xmath26 ) , as well as the jitter of the detectors ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we make the ( good ) approximation that all three are normally - distributed @xmath28 , so that the jitters will add in quadrature to give the minimal resolution @xmath24 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 ps , @xmath31 ps ( as @xmath32 ) , and @xmath33 ps .",
    "we see that the expression is dominated by @xmath26 .",
    "the value of @xmath34 ( 180 ps ) corresponds to a wavelength resolution @xmath35 of 0.13 nm at 1550 nm for a 20-km spool of corning smf-28 fiber .",
    "a simple schematic of the fiber spectrometer setup .",
    "the spectral information of the signal and idler photons are mapped onto the time domain after traveling through the long fiber spool .",
    "a wdm ( labeled demux ) is used to route the shorter - wavelength signal to one detector , and idler to the other detector , while also limiting the spectral extent of each photon .",
    "this is important , as it limits the temporal extent of the signal photon , which can not exceed 24.5 ns ( the sync period of the ti : sapph oscillator ) .",
