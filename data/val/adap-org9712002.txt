    "the last decade has seen considerable experimental , numerical , and analytical effort aimed at better understanding the sustained spatio - temporally chaotic regimes of large , homogeneous systems kept far - from - equilibrium by an external driving force . in particular , detailed investigation of a number of hydrodynamical flow regimes , including convection , shear flow , and crispation experiments , has led to a wealth of interesting insights into the properties of spatio - temporal chaos @xcite .",
    "important pending questions concern the status of the asymptotic limit of long time and large system size , as well as the relationship which may exist between classical equilibrium statistical mechanics and possible statistical descriptions of spatio - temporal chaos in this `` thermodynamic '' limit @xcite .",
    "this article focuses on the critical behavior of models of spatio - temporal chaos close to second - order - like phase transitions which occur in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "theoretical work @xcite has suggested that phase transitions in generic non - equilibrium systems made up of locally interacting subunits belong to the universality class of model a @xcite , for both static and dynamic critical exponents , provided that the order parameter is a non - conserved , scalar quantity . being based on coarse - grained langevin descriptions , the approach developed in @xcite overlooks the exact nature of microscopic time - evolution .",
    "its conclusion also relies on the validity of assumptions generally associated with the dynamic renormalization group formalism .",
    "another significant contribution is that of miller and huse . in @xcite",
    ", they introduce a simple lattice dynamical system with microscopic ising symmetry ( square lattice of locally - coupled , chaotic , odd maps ) , whose salient feature is the presence of a non - equilibrium continuous transition qualitatively similar to the ferromagnetic critical point of the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "ising - like transitions between spatio - temporally chaotic phases turn out to be a fairly common feature of coupled maps lattices ( cmls ) : they are observed for a variety of local maps , lattice geometries , and update rules @xcite .",
    "contrary to the conjecture of @xcite and to early conclusions based on simulations of much smaller systems @xcite , careful analysis of finite - size data obtained from extensive numerical simulations of the miller - huse model shows that the corresponding phase transition does not belong to the ising universality class @xcite .",
    "the measured correlation - length exponent @xmath2 is significantly lower than @xmath3 , while exponent ratios @xmath4 and @xmath5 remain in good agreement with ising values .",
    "comparison with related models , in particular with transitions of sequentially - updated lattice dynamical systems , further indicates that synchronous update is the relevant parameter responsible for departure from ising universality : keeping all other features of the miller - huse model unchanged , ising static exponents are recovered as soon as sites are updated sequentially @xcite .",
    "our main objective is to extend previous work on static critical exponents to the dynamic critical properties of the miller - huse model .",
    "the dynamic critical exponent @xmath1 , which quantifies the algebraic divergence of coherence times at criticality , is known to be sensitive to parameters otherwise irrelevant for static exponents , such as the existence or absence of macroscopic quantities conserved under time - evolution @xcite .",
    "in addition , the nature of update is a relevant parameter for dynamical universality classes of ising systems : synchronous update of clusters of spins yields distinct , significantly lower values of the dynamic exponent @xmath1 than is observed for standard sequential or checkerboard update @xcite . ignoring both the conjecture of @xcite and the numerical results of @xcite , one may thus naively expect phase transitions of synchronously and sequentially updated cmls to be characterized by different dynamical exponents . here",
    ", we want to confirm , for the dynamic properties of ising - like transitions of lattices of coupled chaotic maps , the relevance of the mode of update already discovered in @xcite for their static properties .",
    "similarly , the static universality class observed for synchronously - updated models is revisited from the point of view of their dynamical properties .",
    "compared to ising systems , the measurement of static critical exponents turns out to be significantly more resource - consuming in the case of cmls , due in particular to the presence of unusually large corrections to scaling @xcite .",
    "moreover , extracting reliable values of dynamic critical exponents from direct simulations is a notably difficult task , even in a priori simpler cases . despite much numerical effort ,",
    "the value of the dynamical exponent @xmath1 of model a in dimension @xmath6 remains somewhat controversial ( see @xcite for a survey of work done prior to 1993 , and @xcite for a more recent review ) . the methodology we apply here to phase transitions of cmls is based on recent theoretical work by janssen et al . , which proves the existence of a new universal regime in the early critical dynamics of systems starting from non - equilibrium ( e.g. completely disordered ) initial conditions @xcite .",
    "this regime , termed `` initial critical slip '' or `` universal short - time behavior '' in the literature , is characterized by a new non - trivial exponent @xmath0 , unrelated to the usual static and dynamical exponents .",
    "the dynamical exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be readily obtained from the initial scaling properties of observables of finite - size systems , as shown analytically in @xcite , and first implemented numerically in @xcite .",
    "unlike standard methods , this procedure is nearly free from the difficulties associated with critical slowing down at the transition point : useful simulation times ( @xmath7 ) are typically much shorter than the finite - size coherence time - scale @xmath8 .",
    "statistical accuracy is ensured by ensemble - averaging over a large number of independent realizations .",
    "thanks to high numerical efficiency , good agreement on the value of critical quantities such as @xmath0 and @xmath9 has been already reached for model a @xcite .",
    "this makes comparison with other systems easier , and opens the way to an investigation of the relative universality of @xmath1 and @xmath0 which , based on the theoretical work of janssen et al @xcite , are expected to depend on the same relevant parameters .",
    "this article is organized as follows : current understanding of early - time critical dynamics is briefly reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec - met ] .",
    "the methodology we follow closely parallels that used by okano et al . for of the two - dimensional ising model with heat - bath and metropolis algorithm @xcite .",
    "the same procedure is used throughout , thus allowing meaningful comparison between exponents obtained for different cmls , as well as with exponents of model a. first , the dynamic critical properties of the miller - huse model , a lattice dynamical system with synchronous update , are investigated in sec .",
    "[ sec - mh ] . the model and its phenomenology",

    "[ sec - update - asyn ] , we first consider a sequentially updated model introduced in @xcite , which , according to previous numerical results , belongs to the ising universality class for static critical exponents . in sec .",
    "[ sec - update - saka ] , we turn to sakaguchi s model @xcite , a cml with checkerboard update whose static critical exponents are known exactly to be equal to those of the ising model .",
    "next , we consider , in sec.[sec - theta ] , various synchronously - updated models to investigate whether the universality of the static critical properties of their ising - like transitions extend to their dynamic exponents .",
    "our results are summed up and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - disc ] .",
    "in order to measure the dynamic critical exponent @xmath1 from numerical simulations of finite - size systems , most methods considered until a few years ago made use of the so - called nonlinear relaxation regime , by , e.g. , looking at the decay of the system s time - dependent magnetization @xmath10 according to : @xmath11 or similar relations involving higher - order moments .",
    "this regime was generally believed to be relevant within the time interval @xmath12 , whereas finite - size linear relaxation eventually prevails beyond @xmath13 , where the magnetization decays exponentially : @xmath14 .    a point overlooked until the work of janssen et al .",
    "@xcite is the importance of initial conditions .",
    "suppose that we start from disordered non - equilibrium initial conditions ( magnetization is zero or very close to zero ) with very short initial correlation length , and quench the system to its critical point .",
    "one qualitatively expects fluctuations to be negligible at first : the system is then mean - field - like .",
    "since the mean - field critical temperature is usually larger than the actual critical temperature , the system is in its ordered phase , and the magnetization ( and correlation length ) will want to grow .",
    "this accounts for initial magnetization growth .",

    "this field gives way to a new scaling index @xmath17 independent from already known ones ( both static and dynamical ) , and to a timescale @xmath18 within which a new universal scaling regime sets in .",
    "the new exponent @xmath0 is universal in the same sense as the ususal dynamic critical exponent @xmath1 , since it was obtained within the same formalism . for @xmath19 , and @xmath15 small enough",
    ", the magnetization grows as a power law : @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the microscopic time @xmath22 is the time after which macroscopically correlated regions form , i.e. regions large compared to the microscopic length scale , in this case the lattice constant .",
    "the time - evolution of observables for @xmath23 is nonuniversal , and depends on microscopic features of the model .",
    "the crossover time @xmath18 is obtained by matching eqns .",
    "( [ eq - sc - nlrelax ] ) and ( [ eq - sc - theta ] ) : @xmath24 and diverges in the limit of zero initial magnetization @xmath15 . in that case",
    ", the nonlinear relaxation regime is not observed in the bulk .",
    "then , finite - size scaling theory was introduced by @xcite .",
    "we will need it for interpretation of numerical experiments .",
    "the scale invariant expression reads , for a system of finite size @xmath25 , and the @xmath26 moment of the order parameter , at the critical point : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a scaling factor and @xmath29 is a universal function , independent of microscopic details of the system .",

    "we introduce sakaguchi s model , a system of coupled chaotic maps designed to have exactly the static exponents of the ising model , in order to further assess the relevance of the mode of update and that of the nature of the model for the dynamic scaling properties of ising - like transitions .",
    "a few years ago , sakaguchi introduced a system of coupled bernoulli maps with an exponential coupling scheme and checkerboard update , which leads exactly to the ising equilibrium gibbs measure @xcite .",
    "two continuous variables , @xmath161 and @xmath162 in @xmath163 $ ] , are defined on each site of a two - dimensional square lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "their evolution rule reads : @xmath164 where the ( time - dependent ) slopes @xmath162 of the bernoulli maps are calculated according to : @xmath165 with @xmath166 a coupling constant .",
    "discrete spin variables can be defined by : @xmath167 which allows to retain definition [ eq-mh.mag.inst ] for the fluctuating magnetization .",
    "when sites are updated successively on two checkerboard lattices defined by the parity of @xmath168 , it is possible to show that the invariant measure of this system is the same as that of the ising model @xcite : @xmath169 therefore , static exponents are known exactly ( onsager solution ) .",
    "this was checked numerically in @xcite , following the same procedure as that used for the miller - huse model .",
    "sakaguchi s model does indeed belong to the ising universality class for static critical exponents .",
    "however , nothing is known a priori on dynamical properties , which we will investigate now along the same lines as before .",
    "one advantage of sakaguchi s model is that the critical point @xmath170 is known exactly .",
    "one source of error is thus eliminated .",
    "one drawback is the following : the magnetization @xmath171 depends on site values at _ two _ consecutive time steps .",
    "the method used previously in order to prepare initial conditions with fixed small initial magnetization can not work .",
    "instead , we applied the following procedure : start from random initial conditions and evolve the system at high temperature ( at low @xmath172 , the system is in the disordered phase with zero mean magnetization ) until it reaches by itself the desired initial magnetization @xmath15 . the system is then quenched to the critical coupling . since",
    "the magnetization is calculated from discrete spins , there is no dispersion on the value of initial conditions ( @xmath84 , as before ) . yet , this procedure is more costly numerically , which explains why , in the following , the obtained statistical accuracy is somewhat lower than for the previous two models studied here . in practice , we use @xmath173 , before quenching to @xmath174 .",
    "the protocol used is the same as before .",
    "as expected , this model also exhibits a well - defined initial critical slip regime .",
    "in fact , the microscopic time @xmath22 turns out to be equal to @xmath65 ( fig.[fig - saka.theta ] ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that the macroscopically - correlated domains present at @xmath172 survive the quench to @xmath175 .",
    "impeccable scaling is observed for the initial growth of the magnetization @xmath171 .",
    "reliable measurements are possible only for @xmath176 and @xmath177 : cross - over to the nonlinear relaxation regime occurs too soon ( @xmath178 ) for @xmath179 , and @xmath115 is too costly to reach satisfactory statistical quality due to the preparation of initial conditions .",
    "ensemble average is done over @xmath99 realizations simulated during @xmath180 timesteps . from linear fits over the full interval @xmath181",
    ", we obtain @xmath182 for @xmath176 and @xmath183 for @xmath184 ( fig.[fig - saka.theta ] ) . within error bars ,",
    "no finite - size effects are present .",
    "our estimate is : @xmath185 in good agreement with results obtained for model a @xcite , and not consistent with the value obtained for the miller - huse model .",
    "again , measuring @xmath1 is more difficult .",
    "the scaling of @xmath109 starts late , with a fairly large microscopic time ( @xmath186 for @xmath184 , @xmath187 for @xmath115 ) , estimated as before from the evolution of local exponents . as for non - zero initial magnetizations , ensemble average",
    "is performed over @xmath99 realizations , and the simulation time is @xmath180 , for system sizes up to @xmath115 .",
    "exponents are thus estimated over less than one decade",
    ". however , finite - size effects are negligible for @xmath104 .",
    "we obtain : @xmath188 ( note the large error bars ) . from the exact value @xmath57 ,",
    "this leads to : @xmath189 , roughly compatible with both model a and the miller - huse model . a longer simulation time ( @xmath190 ) , even for the largest system size ( @xmath115 ) leads to qualitatively identical results , without any quantitative improvement : the insert of fig .",
    "[ fig-saka.dyn].a shows that fluctuations of the local exponent @xmath191 , computed over time intervals of duration @xmath192 , include values of @xmath113 expected for both model a and the miller - huse model .",
    "the situation concerning the scaling behavior of the time autocorrelation function is somewhat more satisfactory , despite ( or thanks to ) finite size effects : large size behavior converges toward a value of @xmath137 which is necessarily smaller than the miller - huse exponent @xmath193 .",
    "in fact , data obtained for the largest size considered ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) is characterized by a scaling exponent @xmath194 , compatible with model a value @xmath45 ( cf .",
    "[ fig-saka.dyn].b ) .",
    "this finding is confirmed qualitatively by runs performed for longer simulation times ( @xmath115 , @xmath153 ) : the miller - huse value is not allowed by the evolution of effective behavior ( exponent ) with system size . since we can not cross - check with larger system size due to numerical limitations , we do not provide error bars on our estimate : @xmath195    our numerical results show clearly that the critical dynamics of sakaguchi s model belongs neither to the universality class of miller - huse model , nor to that of the sequentially updated model studied in sec .",
    "[ sec - update - asyn ] .",
    "it is moreover likely that sakaguchi s model belongs to the universality class of model a , for both statics and dynamics : the checkerboard update of sakaguchi s model may thus be analogous to that of , say , glauber dynamics of a spin system .",
    "our results may be summarized as follows ( see table i for numerical values of all exponents estimated so far ) : update is a relevant parameter for dynamic critical exponents of ising - like transitions of coupled chaotic map systems .",
    "not only models with static exponents outside the ising universality class ( miller - huse ) have also their dynamic exponents different from those of model a , but models within the ising static class ( sequentially - updated miller - huse , sakaguchi ) may also have non - ising dynamic exponents ( sequentially - updated miller - huse ) .",
    "in some sense , this is not too surprising since update is already known to be a relevant parameter for the dynamical exponents of spin systems in the ising static class . in the next section ,",
    "we go a step further and investigate whether the universality found at the static level in @xcite among synchronously - updated cmls subsists at the dynamic level .",
    "in this section , we study two variants of the miller - huse model : we consider first the case of a locally anisotropic coupling to three neighbors , and then the case where the piecewise linear local map ( [ eq-def.hm ] ) is replaced by a smooth map .",
    "the static exponents @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 of these variants were measured to be the same , within error bars , as those of the miller - huse model . given the difficulties encountered above when trying to estimate the exponent @xmath1 , in this section we restrict ourselves to measurements of the exponent @xmath0 , via the early - time scaling of @xmath10 .",
    "the three - neighbor variant of the miller - huse model was studied in @xcite because of its particularly weak corrections to scaling .",
    "its anisotropic evolution rule reads : @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the original piecewise linear map ( [ eq-def.hm ] ) .",
    "each site is thus coupled to three of its nearest neighors : sites belonging to even ( resp .",
    "odd ) columns of the lattice are coupled vertically to their northern ( resp .",
    "southern ) neighbor only . rule ( [ eq-sync.trois ] ) is applied synchronously to all sites , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the local anisotropy introduced vanishes at large scales . in this case",
    ", an ising - like transition takes place for a critical coupling @xmath201 , estimated using binder s method @xcite .",
    "the smooth map variant only differs from the miller - huse model by the choice of the local function @xmath200 , which remains a chaotic , odd map of the @xmath59 $ ] interval for symmetry reasons , but now reads : @xmath202 on general grounds , this smooth function , with its expanding and contracting parts , may be considered more `` generic '' than the original piecewise linear map .",
    "an ising - like transition also takes place in this case , for a slightly smaller critical coupling than the miller - huse model : @xmath203 @xcite",
    ".    for both variants , hereafter referred to as `` mh3 '' ( three - neighbor coupling ) and `` c4 '' ( smooth cubic map ) , the methodology used in sec .",
    "[ sec - mh ] to determine exponent @xmath0 for the original miller - huse model can be applied .",
    "initial conditions with fixed , small magnetization @xmath15 are prepared using the same procedure , and the phenomenology observed is the same . in both cases , the microscopic time is visually estimated to be @xmath145 . after this time ,",
    "a clear scaling behavior is observed for @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "[ fig-mh3c4.theta ] ) .",
    "sizes @xmath89 , 32 , 64 and 128 were studied , with ensemble - averaging over 512000 realizations for @xmath204 and 128000 for @xmath90 .",
    "finite - size effects are smaller than error bars for @xmath205 .",
    "statistical errors on @xmath0 are estimated by comparing values obtained for different initial magnetization @xmath206 with @xmath207 and coupling strengths @xmath64 within the uncertainty interval of @xmath86 .",
    "our global ( conservative ) estimates are : @xmath208 not only these values are _ not _ compatible with each other , but both are also at odds with the value found for the original miller - huse model ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "numerical estimates of @xmath0 obtained for all models we considered are gathered in table ii . except in the presence of finite - size and finite - time effects",
    "not detectable in the experimental conditions of our work , the above results lead to conclude that cmls of the miller - huse type exhibit different exponents for the dynamic critical properties of their ising - like transitions even though they share the same static exponents and the same mode of update .",
    "the first conclusion about the series of numerical experiments conducted in this work is that non - trivial early - time critical dynamics occurs in phase transitions of far from equilibrium , coupled map lattices .",
    "the microscopic time @xmath22 after which scaling sets in tends to be small for @xmath10 , generally of the same order of magnitude as for equilibrium systems . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath22 is typically at least one order of magnitude larger for the evolution of second - order quantities such as @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "this is also in agreement with spin systems @xcite .",
    "one would however like to understand why @xmath22 is always larger for second - order quantities than for @xmath10 .",
    "intuitively , it can be argued that in order for the scaling regime of @xmath209 and @xmath210 to set in , the system first needs to generate macroscopically - correlated regions , i.e. @xmath10 must already be in its scaling regime .",
    "thus @xmath211 .",
    "further , one may argue that macroscopically - correlated regions for second order quantities can only establish themselves when the magnetization @xmath10 has changed `` significantly '' , say by a factor 2 . using @xmath212 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath213 .",
    "this admittedly rough argument may explain semi - quantitatively why microscopic times observed for the miller - huse models with sequential and synchronous update differ by two orders of magnitude : @xmath214 , or @xmath215 .",
    "in addition , finite - size corrections to scaling are also typically much larger for second - order quantities than for @xmath10 .",
    "a direct consequence of the observed values of @xmath22 and of the strength of finite - size corrections is that , in practice , the exponent @xmath0 is much easier to measure than the exponent @xmath1 , our initial goal .",
    "thus , although @xmath1 remains largely out of reach in some cases , the critical initial slip method offers the advantage of accurate estimations of @xmath0 .",
    "first , and perhaps most importantly , we confirm , at the level of dynamic critical properties , the results obtained in @xcite at the static level : update is a relevant parameter for universality classes of ising - like transitions .",
    "synchronously - updated coupled map models such as the miller - huse model and its variants mh3 , c4 have critical exponents different from those of model a both at the static and dynamic level .",
    "for the original miller - huse model , our data is even conclusive for both exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "secondly , we extend to the transitions of coupled chaotic maps a result already known for equilibrium spin systems : the static universality class of the ising model breaks down at the dynamic level . the sequentially - updated miller - huse model and the sakaguchi model , which are in the static ising class , possess different dynamic exponents ( in fact our data is unambiguous only for @xmath0 ) .",
    "the distinction between checkerboard and sequential update is known to be irrelevant at equilibrium for both static and dynamic critical exponents , including the exponent @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , the same distinction becomes relevant at the dynamic level for lattices of coupled chaotic maps .",
    "an additional interesting point is that sakaguchi s model seems to possess the dynamic exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 of model a.    thirdly , our data gathered for the sole exponent @xmath0 indicates the splitting of the `` non - equilibrium universality class '' for the static critical properties of synchronously - updated coupled map systems showing ising - like transitions .",
    "variants of the miller - huse model , all shown in @xcite to share the same static exponents , exhibit different values of @xmath0 .",
    "again , as for spin systems , universality classes are narrower for dynamical critical exponents than for static ones . excluding sakaguchi s model , whose control parameter is too markedly different to allow a meaningful comparison , one may notice that numerical estimates of @xmath0 for the four other models depend monotonously on the critical coupling @xmath86 ( see table ii ) : lower values of the coupling constant correspond to a slower coarsening process .",
    "we believe this can be understood by considering the structure of the phase space of these systems which can be seen as a hierarchy of repellors . during coarsening ,",
    "this hierarchy is explored , and thus its scaling properties  which probably depend on @xmath64  must be related to the scaling behavior which defines @xmath0 . of course , the above picture will need to be substantiated in the future , but it already suggests a link between the structure of the phase space ( and hence the details of the dynamics ) and exponent @xmath0 .    in agreement with our findings , which confer a sort of `` maximal '' non - universality to @xmath0 , the tentative picture sketched above , invites comments on the relative status of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , our attempts at measuring @xmath1 ( via @xmath113 and @xmath137 ) have largely failed , mainly because of large values of @xmath22 . however",
    ", data obtained for the variants c4 and mh3 of the miller - huse model are compatible with the idea of a greater universality for @xmath1 than for @xmath0 . in particular , they suggest that variant c4 might possess the same @xmath1 value as the original miller - huse model . thus , we would like to suggest that @xmath0 may be considered as a quantity highly dependent on the details of the dynamics in non - equilibrium situations , while @xmath1 , in comparison , is a more global quantity .",
    "the independence of exponents @xmath1 and @xmath0 is consistent with this conjecture .    to summarize , our numerical experiments provide additional contradictory evidence to the conjecture of @xcite in the case of continuous phase transitions of coupled chaotic map systems .",
    "in other words , the qualitative features of scaling are correctly predicted by renormalization - group methods ( since , e.g. , the scaling behavior predicted by @xcite is observed ) , but the same techniques fail to predict exponents quantitatively .",
    "the above remarks , though , call for more detailed investigations of the respective role of the various dynamical exponents involved in order to explain the origin of the non - universality reported here .",
    "in particular , the possibly different status of @xmath1 and @xmath0 provides an interesting starting point on which to base further research , at both the numerical and theoretical levels .",
    "further , one would also like to know whether the various persistence exponents defined and studied recently for spin systems @xcite and particularly the `` global persistence '' exponent defined in @xcite also pertain to continuous phase transitions of chaotic coupled map lattices , and if so , whether their numerical value also depends on the fine details of the coarsening process following uncorrelated initial conditions , similarly to the dynamic exponent @xmath0 .",
