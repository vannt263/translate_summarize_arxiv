    "evolutionary stellar population synthesis , i.e. modelling spectral energy distributions emitted by evolving stellar populations , is a natural approach to studying the stellar content of different galaxies",
    ". one of the main ingredients of these models are the stellar libraries , which can be empirical or theoretical .",
    "stellar population models usually consider only the total metal content of stars and , therefore , ignore the different chemical abundance patterns that are present in individual stars .",
    "however , different chemical abundance patterns have a strong influence on the shape of the spectra .",
    "in particular , it is well known that stellar population models based on empirical libraries ( which are mostly composed of solar neighbourhood stars ) can not reproduce the high values of mg abundances found in giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "this is commonly interpreted as a consequence of high [ mg / fe ] in these systems , most likely due to a rapid star formation history compared to the more quiet one of the solar neighbourhood ( tinsley 1980 ) .",
    "an obvious solution , explored recently by several authors ( e.g. coelho _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 ; walcher _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 ; lee , worthey & dotter 2009 ) , would be to use theoretical libraries with the desired coverage in chemical abundances .",
    "however , while theoretical libraries have improved dramatically in the last few years ( chavez , malagnini & morossi 1997 ; murphy & meiksin 2004 ; rodriguez - merino _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ; munari _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ; martins _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ; coelho _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ; frmaux _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ; bertone _ et al .",
    "_ 2008 ) , they still do not reproduce real stars of all spectral types , with especial problems depending on the wavelength range ( i.e. martins & coelho 2007 ; bertone _ et al . _ 2008 ) .",
    "some of the remaining problems are the incompleteness of the atomic and molecular line opacity lists in the blue region of the spectrum and for cool stars ( t@xmath1 @xmath2 4500 k ) as well .",
    "another approach is to compute , with the help of model atmospheres , response functions to characterise the variation of specific spectral characteristic ( usually lick indices ) to variation of different elements ( see trippico & bell 1995 ; korn , maraston & thomas 2005 ) .",
    "models using these response functions are those of tantalo , chiosi & bressan ( 1998 ) , trager _",
    "( 2000a ) , and thomas , maraston & bender ( 2003 ) .",
    "however , the accuracy of these theoretical predictions have not been tested empirically yet .",
    "it is the main objective of this work to provide [ mg / fe ] abundance ratios for one of the most complete empirical stellar libraries currently available ( miles ) ( * m*id - resolution * i*saac newton telescope * l*ibrary of * e*mpirical * s*pectra , snchez - blzquez _ et al .",
    "the miles database , which was especially designed for stellar population modelling , contains flux calibrated optical spectra of high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for 985 stars covering @xmath33525 - 7500  with a homogeneous resolution @xmath4 = fwhm = 2.3  . the parametric coverage of sample stars in the three - dimensional h - r diagram is quite wide : 2800 @xmath5 t@xmath1 @xmath5 50400 k , 0.0 @xmath5 @xmath6 g @xmath5 @xmath75.0 , and @xmath82.7 @xmath5 [ fe / h ] @xmath5 @xmath71.0 dex , where [ fe / h ] = log(fe / h)@xmath9 @xmath8 log(fe / h)@xmath10 such that formally log(fe ) = log(@xmath11(fe)/@xmath11(h ) ) + 12 , log(h ) = 12 and @xmath11(fe ) and @xmath11(h ) are the numerical densities ( @xmath12 ) of iron and hydrogen atoms respectively .",
    "the scales for these photospheric parameters were carefully defined by cenarro _",
    "their precisions , respectively @xmath13100 k , @xmath130.2 and @xmath130.1 dex , makes miles good for ssp modelling . for the present work , we excluded those stars with uncertain or wrong atmospheric parameters ( see vazdekis _",
    "_ 2010 for details about how these stars were identified ) .",
    "the miles [ mg / fe ] catalogue presented here consists of two measurement sets . the first one is composed of measurements obtained from the literature from high spectral resolution analyses properly calibrated to a common system .",
    "the second set assembles abundances measured by us directly from the miles mid - resolution ( hereafter mr ) spectra and calibrated using the high - resolution ( hereafter hr ) sample .",
    "the catalogue is represented in two separate tables for field and cluster stars .",
    "both tables are only available in electronic form .",
    "the paper layout is as follows : section 2 describes the compilation of hr abundance measurements from the literature and their calibration ; section 3 shows the mg abundance measurements from the miles spectra ; section 4 compiles the miles [ mg / fe ] catalogue and analyses its coverage over the library parameter space ; section 5 compares our stellar data with predictions of theoretical models focusing on the behaviour of some lick indices with [ mg / fe ] ; and , finally , section 6 plans for applications to building new simple stellar population models with variable @xmath0-enhancement .",
    "section 7 summarizes the whole paper and final conclusions .",
    "there are also three appendices : appendix a confronts the compiled hr data with a well - known stellar spectrum library , appendix b presents comparisons of the miles photospheric parameter scales with those from the compiled hr studies , and appendix c compares the results for cluster stars with hr studies .",
    "the first step of this work consisted of performing a bibliographic compilation of magnesium abundances from high - resolution spectroscopic analyses for the miles library stars . to guarantee homogeneity between the measurements provided by several studies we performed a calibration and correction of systematic differences among sources and a chosen standard reference system , following a similar procedure as in cenarro _",
    "et al . _ ( 2001 , 2007 )",
    "for instance , feltzing & gustafsson ( 1998 ) give a detailed error analysis of elemental abundances for g and k metal - rich dwarfs also including comparisons with other studies . in this section , we describe the chosen reference sample and the procedures we followed to homogenize the measurements to a single uniform scale of [ mg / fe ] .      our reference sample to define a scale for the mg / fe abundance ratio is from borkova & marsakov ( 2005 , hereafter bm05 ) .",
    "the catalogue of borkova & marsakov is a robust compilation of the atmospheric parameters t@xmath1 , log @xmath14 and [ fe / h ] plus [ mg / fe ] from high - s / n high - resolution analyses of field stars published between 1989 and 2003 ( covering 36 studies with mg abundance determinations for around 900 stars ) .",
    "bm05 computed weighted average values and their errors through an iterative procedure in order to correct for the systematic deviations of each data set relative to reduced mean homogeneous scales .",
    "the uncertainty of [ mg / fe ] in bm05 is 0.05 and 0.07 dex , respectively , for metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath15 @xmath81.0 dex ) and metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath5 @xmath81.0 dex ) .",
    "the bm05 catalogue contains 218 stars in common with the miles library ( all with log @xmath14 @xmath16 3.0 ) .",
    "bm05 was also the reference work adopted in cenarro _",
    "( 2009 ) , where mg and ca abundances were compiled for 192 stars of their calcium triplet stellar library ( hereafter cat ) of 706 objects .",
    "as there are many miles stars in common with the cat sample ( 132 stars ) , this work provides values that we can compare with ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we first checked the possible presence of systematic differences in the scales of miles and bm05 atmospheric parameters ( [ fe / h ] , log @xmath14 and t@xmath1 ) , however we did not find any ( see appendix b for details ) .",
    "apart from the bm05 compilation , we obtained [ mg / fe ] for 97 more stars from 15 other hr studies , as listed in table 1 .",
    "their abundance ratios were then carefully transformed onto the adopted scale as described next ."
