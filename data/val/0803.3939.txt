    "the benefits of using forward proton detectors as a tool to study standard model ( sm ) and new physics at the lhc have been fully appreciated only recently , see for instance , @xcite  -  @xcite .",
    "the measurements of central exclusive production ( cep ) is a prime target of the fp420 project @xcite , which aims at the installation of forward detectors in the lhc tunnel 420 m from the interaction points of the atlas and cms experiments .",
    "the combined detection of both outgoing protons and the centrally produced system gives access to a rich programme of studies in qcd , electroweak , higgs and bsm physics .",
    "importantly , these measurements will provide valuable information on the higgs sector of mssm and other popular bsm scenarios , see @xcite  -  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the cep process allows for the unique possibility to study directly the coupling of higgs - like bosons to bottom quarks @xcite .",
    "the theoretical formalism @xcite  -  @xcite for the description of a cep process contains quite distinct parts , shown symbolically in fig .",
    "[ fig : parts ] . we first have to calculate the @xmath3 subprocess , @xmath4 , convoluted with the gluon distributions @xmath5 .",
    "next we must account for the qcd corrections which reflect the absence of additional qcd radiation in the hard subprocess  that is , for the sudakov factor @xmath6 .",
    "finally , we must enter soft physics to calculate the survival probability @xmath7 of the rapidity gaps .",
    ".,height=226 ]    the uncertainties of the cep predictions are potentially not small .",
    "therefore , it is important to perform checks using processes that will be accessible in the first runs of the lhc @xcite with integrated luminosities in the range 100 @xmath8 to 1 @xmath9 . in @xcite",
    "we identified reactions where the different ingredients of the formalism used to calculate cep could be tested experimentally .",
    "we first consider measurements which do not rely on proton tagging and can be performed through the detection of rapidity gaps .",
    "the main uncertainties of the cep predictions are associated with    * the probability @xmath7 that additional secondaries will not populate the gaps ; * the probability to find the appropriate gluons , that are given by generalized , unintegrated distributions @xmath10 ; * the higher order qcd corrections to the hard subprocess , where the most important is the sudakov suppression ; * the so - called semi - enhanced absorptive corrections ( see @xcite ) and other effects , which may violate the soft - hard factorization .",
    "as a rule , the gap survival probability is calculated within a multichannel eikonal approach @xcite . the probability @xmath7 of elastic @xmath11 rescattering , shown symbolically by @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ fig : parts ] can be evaluated in a model independent way once the elastic cross section @xmath13 is measured at the lhc .",
    "however , there may be some excited states between the blob @xmath12 and the amplitude on the right - hand - side of fig .",
    "[ fig : parts ] .",
    "the presence of such states enlarges the absorptive correction . in order to experimentally check the role of this effect ,",
    "we need to consider a process with a bare cross section that can be reliably calculated .",
    "good candidates are the production of @xmath14 or @xmath15 bosons with rapidity gaps .",
    "production with 2 rapidity gaps ,",
    "( b ) inclusive @xmath14 production , and ( c ) @xmath15 production with 2 rapidity gaps.,height=226 ]    in the case of ` @xmath14+gaps ' production the main contribution comes from the diagram shown in fig .  [ fig : wz](a ) @xcite .",
    "one gap , @xmath16 , is associated with photon exchange , while the other , @xmath17 , is associated with the @xmath14 .",
    "the cross section is proportional to the quark distribution at a large scale and not too small @xmath18 , where the uncertainties of the parton densities are small . to select these events in the early lhc runs",
    ", we can use the rapidity gap trigger combined with a high @xmath19 lepton or jet trigger .",
    "an important point here is that the minimum value of @xmath20 of the photon , @xmath21 , is not negligible .",
    "note that the momentum fraction @xmath22 associated with the upper proton can be measured by summing the momentum fractions of the outgoing @xmath14 and the hadrons observed in the calorimeters . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : w3 ] the rescattering reduces the cross section by the factor @xmath7 . the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : w3 ] were calculated within the scenario where the valence quark is allocated to the component with the smallest absorption and the sea quark to the absorptive component with largest cross section . since the valence quark contribution is more important for @xmath23 production and for the configuration with the largest gap size @xmath24 , the expected gap survival factor @xmath7 is found to be larger .     as a function of @xmath25 calculated using the global soft model of @xcite , assuming that the valence ( sea ) quarks are associated with the weak ( strong ) absorptive components .",
    "the small spread of the predictions arising from the different partonic content of the diffractive eigenstates means that @xmath14+gaps events offer a meaningful test of the @xmath7 factor.,height=340 ]    in the first lhc data runs the ratio ( @xmath14+gaps/@xmath14 inclusive ) will be measured first .",
    "this measurement is a useful check of the models for soft rescattering . a good way to study the low impact parameter ( @xmath26 ) region is to observe @xmath15 boson production via @xmath27 fusion ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : wz](c ) . here ,",
    "both of the rapidity gaps originate from heavy boson exchange , and the corresponding @xmath26 region is similar to that for exclusive higgs production .",
    "the expected @xmath15+gaps cross section is of the order of 0.2 pb , and @xmath7=0.3 for @xmath28 and for quark jets with @xmath29 gev @xcite .",
    "one problem is that even with the @xmath29 gev cut , the qcd background arising from qcd @xmath30 central exclusive production is comparable to the electroweak @xmath31 jet signal .",
    "therefore , we should concentrate on the leptonic decay modes of the @xmath15 boson , which results in a smaller event rate .",
    "when the forward proton detectors become operational we can do more .",
    "both the longitudinal and transverse momentum of the protons can be measured , and we can study the @xmath32 behaviour of the cross section sections and scan the proton opacity @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the cep of a system @xmath33 essentially has the form @xcite @xmath34 here the factor @xmath35 arises from the integration over the proton transverse momentum .",
    "also , @xmath5 denotes the generalized unintegrated gluon distribution in the limit of @xmath36 .",
    "the distribution @xmath5 has not yet been measured explicitly . however , in our case it can be obtained from the conventional diagonal gluon distribution , @xmath37 , known from the global parton analyses , see @xcite for details .",
    "the main uncertainty here comes from the lack of knowledge of the integrated gluon distribution @xmath38 at low @xmath18 and small scales .",
    "for example , taking @xmath39 we find that a variety of recent mrst @xcite and cteq @xcite global analyses give a spread of @xmath40",
    ". these are big uncertainties bearing in mind that the cep cross section depends on @xmath41 .",

    "measurement performed by cms @xcite looks quite encouraging . ]",
    "the process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : upsilon](a ) .",
    "the cross section for @xmath43 @xcite is given in terms of exactly the same unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath5 that occurs in fig .",
    "[ fig : parts ]",
    ". there may be competition between production via photon exchange , fig .",
    "[ fig : upsilon](a ) , and via odderon exchange , see fig .",
    "[ fig : upsilon](b ) . to date , odderon exchange has not been observed . on the other hand",
    ", a lowest - order calculation indicates that the odderon process ( b ) may be comparable to the photon - initiated process ( a ) ( for example , @xcite ) .",
    "if the upper proton is tagged , it will be straightforward to separate the two mechanisms since odderon production has no @xmath44 .",
    "singularity characteristic of the photon .",
    "the expression for @xmath45 is given in @xcite . in order to use this process to constrain the gluon distribution",
    "it would be preferable to tag the lower proton .",
    "traditionally , the search for the exclusive dijet signal at the tevatron , @xmath46 , is performed @xcite by plotting the cross section in terms of the variable @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the mass of the whole central system .",
    "the @xmath49 distribution is strongly smeared out by qcd bremsstrahlung , hadronization , the jet searching algorithm and other experimental effects @xcite .     of the whole central system",
    "does not necessarily occur at @xmath50 .",
    "the rapidity interval containing the three jets is denoted by @xmath51 , outside of which there is no hadronic activity.[fig:2],height=264 ]    to weaken the role of smearing it was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the dijet distribution in terms of a new variable r_j  =  2e_t  ( cosh  ^*)/m_a  , [ eq : j ] where only the transverse energy and the rapidity @xmath52 of the jet with the _ largest _ @xmath53 are used in the numerator . here",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 is the rapidity of the whole central system .",
    "clearly the jet with the largest @xmath53 is less affected by hadronization , final parton radiation etc . at leading order , it is sufficient to consider the emission of a third jet , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , where we take all three jets to lie in a specified rapidity interval @xmath51 .",
    "the cross section @xmath56 , as a function of @xmath57 , for the exclusive production of a pair of high @xmath53 dijets accompanied by a third jet was calculated and discussed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the measurements of the exclusive two- and three - jet cross sections _ as a function of @xmath53 _ of the highest jet allow a detailed check of the sudakov physics ; with much more information coming from the observation of the @xmath51 dependence .    a clear way to observe the effect of the sudakov suppression is just to study the @xmath53 dependence of exclusive dijet production .",
    "on dimensional grounds we would expect @xmath58 .",
    "this behaviour is modified by the anomalous dimension of the gluon and by a stronger sudakov suppression with increasing @xmath53 .",
    "already the existing cdf dijet data @xcite exclude predictions which omit the sudakov effect .",
    ", and the soft rescattering is on an intermediate parton , giving rise to a gap survival factor @xmath59 ; ( b ) and ( c ) are the reggeon and qcd representations , respectively.,height=226 ]    the soft - hard factorization implied by fig .  [",
    "fig : parts ] could be violated by the so - called enhanced reggeon diagrams , caused by the rescattering of an intermediate parton generated in the evolution of @xmath5 . such a diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : enh](a ) .",

    "@xcite . a typical diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : enh](c ) . for lhc energies",
    "it was found that the probability of such rescattering may be numerically large .",
    "the reason is that the gluon density grows in the low @xmath18 region and , for low @xmath32 partons , approaches the saturation limit . however , as shown in @xcite , the enhanced diagram should affect mainly the very beginning of the qcd evolution  the region that can not be described perturbatively and which , in the calculations of @xcite , is already included phenomenologically .    experimentally , we can study the role of semi - enhanced absorption by measuring the ratio @xmath60 of diffractive events for @xmath14 ( or @xmath42 or dijet ) production as compared to the inclusive process @xcite .",
    "that is r  =  =   s^2s^2_en_over  b_t , [ eq : ren ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the parton densities determined from the global analyses of inclusive and diffractive dis data , respectively . for @xmath14 or @xmath63 production",
    "the parton densities @xmath64 are quark distributions , whereas for dijet or @xmath42 they are mainly gluon densities .",
    "experimentally , we can observe a double distribution @xmath65 , and form the ratio @xmath60 using the inclusive cross section , @xmath66 .",
    "if we neglect the enhanced absorption , it is quite straightforward to calculate the ratio @xmath60 of ( [ eq : ren ] ) .",

    "the addition of forward proton detectors to lhc experiments will add unique capabilities to the existing lhc experimental programme . for certain bsm scenarios",

    "there is also a rich qcd , electroweak , and more exotic physics , menu .",
    "the uncertainties in the prediction of the rate of a cep process are potentially not small .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to perform checks of the theoretical formalism using processes that will be experimentally accessible in the first runs of the lhc @xcite .",
    "most of the diffractive measurements described above can be performed , without detecting the forward protons , by taking advantage of the relatively low luminosity in the early lhc data runs .",
    "this allows the use of a veto trigger to select events with a large rapidity gap(s ) . in this way",
    "we are able to probe the various individual components of the formalism used to predict the cep cross sections .    to summarise , the gap survival factor , @xmath7 , caused by eikonal rescattering , may be studied as illustrated in fig  [ fig : w3 ] and the possible enhanced , @xmath67 , contributions as shown in figs .",

    "first , it is possible to measure directly the cross section @xmath73 for single diffractive dissociation and also the cross section @xmath74 for soft central diffractive production .",
    "these measurements will strongly constrain the models used to describe diffractive processes and the effects of soft rescattering .",
    "the recent predictions can be found in @xcite .",
