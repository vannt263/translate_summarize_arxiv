    "relaxation phenomena in strongly interacting systems have been studied extensively , including various types of threshold phenomena .",
    "one of the most typical examples is the decomposition at the coercive field ( the end of the hysteresis loop of a ferromagnetic system ) .",
    "this phenomenon appears in the field dependence of the order parameter in the ordered phase . in mean - field studies , this phenomenon is well described by the change in the free energy as a function of the magnetization ( the order parameter of a ferromagnetic system ) .",
    "that is , in the ordered state , the free energy has two minima representing the symmetry - broken states .",
    "when we apply an external field , one of them is selected to be the equilibrium state . for a weak field",
    ", however , the other state remains as a metastable state .",
    "when the field becomes strong , the metastable state finally becomes unstable .",
    "this point is called the spinodal point . however , in models with short - range interactions , fluctuations cause the system to escape from the metastable state through nucleation phenomena , and thus the change of the relaxation time is smeared .",
    "thus , although there are several studies on the divergence of the relaxation near the spinodal points @xcite , the spinodal phenomenon in short - range systems must be defined only as a crossover @xcite .",
    "recently , however , it has been pointed out that the mean - field universality class is realized in spin - crossover type systems @xcite . in these materials , the volume of the unit cell changes , depending on the local two - fold states ( say the high - spin ( hs ) and low - spin ( ls ) states ) .",
    "the volume change causes a lattice distortion , and the elastic interactions among the local distortions cause an effective long - range interaction among the spin states .",
    "the critical properties of the spin - crossover system turned out to belong to the mean - field universality class .",
    "it was also found that the finite - size analysis for various quantities is very similar to the long - range , weakly interacting model ( the husimi - temperley model ) .    in spin - crossover systems",
    ", one may expect that the dynamics also corresponds to that of the mean - field model .",
    "in particular , various threshold phenomena have been pointed out in the dynamics of spin - crossover type materials .",
    "for example , a spinodal phenomenon without nucleation type clustering was reported in numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "the change is considered not to be a crossover process but a change with a true critical singularity that can be described by mean - field dynamics @xcite .",
    "moreover , threshold phenomena have been pointed out in the dependence of the photo - excitation process on the strength of the photo - irradiation , which can be modeled as a kind of spinodal phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the metastable state does not relax to the stable state in the mean - field approximation , which corresponds to the infinite system size in the husimi - temperley model . in recent extensive studies on nano - size systems ,",
    "finite - size effects turn out to play important roles .",
    "therefore , it would be useful to study finite - size effects on the spinodal phenomenon as a critical dynamical process .",
    "the critical phenomena of the phase transition were studied in a dynamical mean - field model .",
    "the relaxation time diverges when the parameter approaches the threshold value .",
    "binder studied the divergence of the relaxation time in spinodal phenomena in the mean - filed model by a monte carlo method  @xcite .",
    "although the metastable state does not relax to the stable state in the mean - field approximation , paul , heermann , and binder studied the relaxation from the metastable side in finite - size systems , and obtained a finite - size scaling form of the relaxation time  @xcite .",
    "the size dependence of the relaxation was also discussed recently @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the asymptotic behavior of the relaxation time of the infinitely long - range interaction model ( the husimi - temperley model ) near the spinodal point including the metastable region , the spinodal point , and the unstable region .",
    "we reexamine the scaling properties near the spinodal point , which have been proposed by paul , heermann , and binder @xcite .    as in the previous studies ,",
    "we adopt the glauber dynamics , and derive a master equation for the probability distribution of the total magnetization .",
    "we first derive a master equation as a function of the total magnetization , which is possible in the husimi - temperley model because of the long - range nature of the interactions .",
    "then , we derive a fokker - planck equation by using an expansion in terms of the inverse system size , which is an example of the van kampen omega - expansion @xcite . we analyze the fokker - planck equation and derive a scaling relation and also asymptotic forms of the relaxation times .",
    "these properties are confirmed by direct numerical investigations of the original master equation , as well as corresponding monte carlo simulations of the stochastic decay process .",
    "we also extend the analysis to general threshold phenomena , such as switching from ls to hs states in spin - crossover materials by photo - irradiation .",
    "we obtain the effects of the photo - irradiation on the master equation , and show that the critical properties of these processes are the same as those of the spinodal phenomena .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the spinodal phenomena and define the master equation for the long - range model .",
    "then , we study the asymptotic size dependence of the relaxation time near the spinodal point in section iii .",
