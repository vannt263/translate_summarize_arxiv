    "in one - dimensional electron systems , the conformal field theory has succeeded in the description of the low - energy physics of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid .",
    "recent experimental progress , such as angle resolved photoemission and neutron scattering , demands the understanding of the elementary excitation pictures of the dynamics not only in the low - energy and long - wave length limit , but over the wide range of frequency and momentum .",

    "@xcite proposed the approximate conjecture of the spin structure factor @xmath1 in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath0 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model with nearest neighbor interaction . by usage of the mathematical works@xcite , the exact expression for two - spinon contributions to @xmath1 in the thermodynamic limit",
    "was found  @xcite .",
    "the exact result and mller ansatz for @xmath1 have the same singularity at the lower spectral boundary , which is called the des cloizeaux - pearson mode .",
    "remarkable progress has been made on the bethe ansatz ( ba )  @xcite , which enables us to numerically calculate the @xmath1 for the heisenberg model in a magnetic field for relatively large system size  @xcite .",
    "recently , a dynamical density - matrix renormalization group ( ddmrg ) method has been developed for calculating dynamical correlation functions at zero temperature in quantum lattice models .",
    "it is based on a variational formulation of the correction vector technique  @xcite .",
    "this method is an extension of the standard dmrg method  @xcite which is a powerful numerical technique for a variety of 1d systems , whereby we can obtain very accurate ground state and low - lying excited states .",
    "so far , it has been shown that the momentum - dependent dynamical quantities can be calculated with good resolution in finite open hubbard chains by the ddmrg method  @xcite .",
    "we could also expect comparable performance for the same model in magnetic fields . in this work",
    ", we apply the ddmrg method to the 1d @xmath0 heisenberg model with an uniform and a staggered magnetic fields and calculate the spin structure factor @xmath1 .",
    "the accuracy of the ddmrg method is checked by comparing to some analytic solutions .",
    "in addition , the difference of performance by the boundary conditions is demonstrated .",
    "we note that the heisenberg model can be dealt with the dmrg technique much easier than the hubbard model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we introduce the model and the spin structure factor .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to show the brief outline of the ddmrg method . in section [ sec4 ]",
    ", we demonstrate the ddmrg calculations of the spin structure factor for various magnetic fields .",
    "the performance with open boundary condition ( obc ) as well as with periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) is examined in comparison with the exact solutions .",
    "some remarks are given in the final section .",
    "we consider the 1d @xmath0 heisenberg model in magnetic fields : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between neighboring sites .",
    "henceforth we take @xmath4 as the unit of energy . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are a uniform and a staggered magnetic fields along the @xmath7-direction , respectively .",
    "the dynamical spin structure factor is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the fourier transform of the spin operator @xmath11 at site @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , respectively , the @xmath15-th eigenenergy and eigenstate of the system ( with the ground state denoted by @xmath16 ) .",
    "note that the definition of the momentum - dependent spin operator @xmath9 depends on choosing the boundary conditions .",
    "the definitions are given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "in this section , the ddmrg method is briefly summarized for calculating the dynamical spin structure factor ( [ strucfact ] ) .",
    "thus , we are interested in the momentum - dependent spectral functions , @xmath17 the dynamical spin structure factor is then obtained as @xmath18 to compute the dynamic quantity such as eq .",
    "( [ spec ] ) , we use the ddmrg method .",
    "this approach is based on a variational principle .",
    "one can easily show that for @xmath19 and fixed frequency @xmath20 the minimum of the functional @xmath21 with respect to all quantum states @xmath22 is @xmath23 the functional minimum is related to the convolution of the dynamical spin structure factor  ( [ spec2 ] ) with a lorentz distribution of width @xmath24 by @xmath25    the ddmrg method consists essentially of minimizing the functional  ( [ functional ] ) numerically using the standard dmrg algorithm .",
    "thus the ddmrg provides the dynamical spin structure factor @xmath26 for a finite broadening @xmath24 .",
    "the full spectrum  ( [ spec2 ] ) convolved with the lorentz distribution is given as @xmath27 } \\label{convolution}\\ ] ] the real part of eq .",
    "( [ spec ] ) can be calculated with no additional computational cost but is generally less accurate .",
    "the necessary broadening of spectral functions in ddmrg calculations is actually very useful for studying continuous spectra or for doing a finite - size scaling analysis  @xcite .",
    "if one would like to obtain the spectrum in the limits of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , it can be done by carrying out a deconvolution of the ddmrg data  @xcite . in theory",
    ", the deconvolution scheme corresponds to solving ( [ convolution ] ) for obtaining @xmath30 , where a set of @xmath31 on the left - hand side is calculated with the ddmrg method .",
    "we also know that the broadened spectrum of the system on an infinite lattice ( @xmath28 ) is usually almost identical to the spectrum on a finite lattice ( @xmath32 ) if @xmath33 ( the constant @xmath34 is comparable to the width of the spectrum ) .",
    "therefore , assuming that the ddmrg data @xmath26 describes the broadened spectrum for @xmath35 , one can solve ( [ convolution ] ) approximately under the condition that @xmath1 is the convolved ` exact ' spin structure factor .",
    "we note that @xmath26 must be a continuous and relatively smooth function in order to obtain quantitatively accurate spectrum after deconvolution . to this end",
    ", it is required to choose @xmath24 smaller than the width of the spectrum in @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath7-component of the total - spin @xmath36 is now a good quantum number for the dmrg calculation .",
    "therefore , it is very efficient to classify the hamiltonian by @xmath36",
    ". let us first study @xmath36 of the ground state in the system with magnetic fields before starting the dynamical calculations . in fig .",
    "[ totalsz_uni](a ) , we show @xmath36 of the ground state as a function of the uniform magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "the calculations are carried out with the dmrg method in a chain with @xmath37 sites under the pbc .",
    "note that @xmath36 is equivalent to the magnetization of the system via the relation @xmath38 .    for small @xmath5 ,",
    "the magnetization is induced proportionately with the uniform field , @xmath39 .",
    "@xcite the derivative @xmath40 becomes larger with increasing @xmath5 since the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations are rapidly weakened with approaching to the fully - polarized phase .",
    "the system is fully polarized at a critical uniform field @xmath41 where the spin susceptibility diverges , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "we also show the dependence of @xmath36 on the staggered magnetic field @xmath6 for several kinds of @xmath5 values in fig .",
    "[ totalsz_uni](b ) .",
    "we can see that the magnetization is rapidly suppressed by the staggered field and it reaches to zero at a critical value @xmath43 . the critical staggered field",
    "is roughly scaled as @xmath44 .",
    "normally , the obc is applied to the ( d)dmrg calculations in order to achieve an accurate treatment ; namely , we can study systems with the obc on much larger lattices than systems with the pbc , with keeping a sufficient accuracy . especially in interacting fermion systems such as the hubbard and the @xmath45@xmath46@xmath4 models",
    ", the obc seems to be rather essential to adequately truncate their large hilbert space .",
    "however , a balk system is generally better described using the pbc , and moreover the exact definition of the momentum - dependent operators with the obc is quite difficult .    here",
    ", an idea will naturally arise as follows : it may be that the pbc can be applicable in a spin system where the hilbert space is much more reduced than that in the fermion systems . motivated by this idea , we check the ddmrg performance with the pbc in the 1d @xmath0 heisenberg model .",
    "we now start to calculate the dynamical spin structure factor ( [ strucfact ] ) . with the pbc ,",
    "the spin operators @xmath47 are defined by @xmath48 with momentum @xmath49 for integers @xmath50 .",
    "using ba solutions on a finite lattice , the spectral weight are available in the case with the uniform magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "comparison with the ba solution will provide an opportunity to test the performance of the ddmrg method . in fig .",
    "[ cf_bethe ] , we compare the ddmrg spectra with the line shapes based on the ba solutions in @xmath51 , where the system size is @xmath37 sites and the broadening is taken as @xmath52 for both of the methods .",
    "we can see excellent agreements in the low - energy excitations , whereas the ba spectra deviate from the ddmrg data in the high - frequency range .",
    "it means that the ddmrg method can take into account higher - order terms than the ba treatment .",
    "if the discarded weight @xmath53 is sufficiently small in the dmrg truncation procedure , e.g. , @xmath54 , the ddmrg results for finite systems are numerically exact in the same sense as ` exact diagonalization ' results are . in the present calculations , we keep up to @xmath55 density - matrix eigenstates and",
    "the typical discarded weight is less than @xmath56 .",
    "thus , we are confident that the ddmrg method using the pbc works well in the @xmath0 heisenberg chain with at least up to several tens of sites .",
    "let us now mention how large system can be dealt with using the ddmrg method .",
    "the performance depends mainly on the number of the density - matrix eigenstates truncated @xmath57 .",
    "as the truncation number @xmath57 increases , the accuracy of calculation is improved but more cpu time and disk space are required .",
    "practically , we could keep a several hundreds density - matrix eigenstates with the present typical cluster machine , e.g. , pentium 4 3.2ghz or opteron 252 2.6ghz . in fig .",
    "[ disc_weight ] , we show the logarithm of average discarded weight @xmath53 as a function of system size @xmath58 for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 in the calculation of @xmath62 .",
    "naturally , @xmath53 decreases as @xmath57 increases at a fixed system size . on the other hand , for a fixed @xmath57 , @xmath63 increases rapidly with increasing @xmath58 for smaller systems and",
    "is almost constant for larger systems .",
    "empirically , we can no longer expect a good dmrg performance in this ` constant ' region .",
    "for example , we estimate @xmath37 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 as the optimum system sizes for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , respectively . therefore",
    ", the ddmrg calculation with about a hundred lattice sites would be adequately possible in the standard @xmath0 heisenberg chain using the pbc if we take @xmath66 .",
    "we then add the staggered magnetic field to the system under a fixed uniform magnetic field . in fig .",
    "[ sqw_l40 ] , we show the spin structure factors @xmath67 for @xmath68 at @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 with fixing @xmath74 , calculated with the ddmrg method for @xmath37 and @xmath75 applying the pbc . the high - energy structures , which can not be obtained by the conformal field theory , are clearly seen .    for @xmath69",
    "[ see also fig .",
    "[ cf_bethe ] ] , the feature of @xmath1 is very similar to that of haldane - shastry model ( @xmath76 interaction )  @xcite . in the lower energy edge of the small @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) in the @xmath79 ,",
    "the one antispinon ( magnon ) contributes as a @xmath80-function peak . at @xmath81 ,",
    "the exact form is known , @xmath82 , which presents a resonant mode of the magnetization induced by the uniform magnetic field . in haldane - shastry model",
    "can be expressed in terms of the analytic expression of the advanced green function for the spinless sutherland model with coupling parameter @xmath83 .",
    "other components , @xmath84 and the two - spinon plus one - antispinon contribution to @xmath85 for haldane - shastry model also can be expressed by the correlation function of the spinless sutherland model  @xcite . ]",
    "the spectra are changed gradually with increasing @xmath6 and we can see some predominant features for @xmath86 as the following :    the low - energy structures of @xmath87 around @xmath81 arise .",
    "they are associated with increase of the weight of unfluctuating antiferromagnetic configuration in the ground state .",
    "the one - magnon peaks of @xmath79 in the small momentum region are smeared and they will disappear when @xmath88 .    in the large momentum ( @xmath89 ) region of @xmath79 , the continuum structure when @xmath69 turn to a few discrete peaks due to the decrease of spin fluctuations .",
    "the band structure of @xmath85 seems to be split into two small - dispersive bands around @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we now turn to the calculation with the obc .",
    "a ddmrg result with the obc is less exact than that with the pbc for the same system size .",
    "however , the obc enable us to carry out a calculation for much larger systems , and then we may obtain the dynamical quantities in the limits of @xmath28 and @xmath92 through additional techniques such as the finite - size scaling or the deconvolution techniques . hence",
    ", it would be also useful to check a performance with the obc .",
    "when the obc is applied , we usually use the eigenstates of the particle - in - a - box problem to define the operators @xmath93 with quasi - momentum @xmath94 for integers @xmath95 .",
    "this definition of @xmath47 should be equivalent to that for the pbc in the thermodynamic limit , but the agreement may not necessarily good in finite systems . in fig .",
    "[ nomag_l192 ] , we show the ddmrg results of @xmath85 without magnetic field for @xmath96 and @xmath75 with obc , as well as the exact line shape of the two - spinon excitation contribution for @xmath28  @xcite . in order to compare the finite - size ddmrg spectrum with the exact solution without broadening , we need to eliminate the broadening @xmath24 from the ` convolved ' ddmrg spectrum .    an approach for obtaining the spectrum in the @xmath29 limit is the deconvolution of the ddmrg spectrum .",
    "theoretically , a deconvolution means solving ( [ convolution ] ) for @xmath1 using the ddmrg data in the left - hand side .",
    "if it was possible to do this calculation exactly , one would obtain the discrete spectrum on a finite lattice of @xmath58 sites .",
    "nevertheless , the broadened spectrum on a infinite lattice ( @xmath28 ) is usually almost identical to the discretized ddmrg spectrum ( @xmath97 ) under the condition @xmath33 .",
    "since the width of @xmath85 is always less than @xmath98 according to the exact solution , our choice @xmath75 indeed satisfies the condition .    at @xmath99 ,",
    "the deconvoluted ddmrg data seems to agree well with the exact solution in the presented scale [ see fig .",
    "[ nomag_l192 ] ( a ) ] . actually , the deconvoluted ddmrg data is a shade thinner than the exact solution .",
    "it might come from the difference of momentum taken in the calculations , i.e. , @xmath99 in the ddmrg and @xmath100 in the exact solutions .",
    "nevertheless , it can be rather hard to find the existence of @xmath101-divergence for the lower edge @xmath102 expected from the exact solution .",
    "if the width of a peak for @xmath29 is smaller than @xmath24 , the we can not obtain it accurately by the deconvolution technique .",
    "hence , we could not see the very sharp structure of @xmath103 at @xmath104 correctly .",
    "on the other hand , the agreement is not very good at @xmath105 [ see fig .",
    "[ nomag_l192 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "occasionally , quantitative estimation would be somewhat problematic .",
    "we find that the accuracy of spectrum is usually the worst around @xmath106 for using the obc .",
    "however , we suggest that the definition of operators with the quasi - momentum gives a good approximation at least qualitatively .",
    "the other approach is the finite - size scaling analysis of the ddmrg data .",
    "@xcite in fig .",
    "[ nomag_scaling ] ( a ) , we show the spin structure factor @xmath85 at @xmath99 for several system sizes @xmath58 .",
    "we keep a relation @xmath107 for systematic extrapolation .",
    "we can clearly see the convergence of the finite - size spectra toward the exact spectrum as @xmath24 decreases .",
    "we also can study the lower - edge behavior more quantitatively by a scaling analysis of the maximal value in the ddmrg spectrum @xmath85 .",
    "for instance , the height of the low - energy maximum @xmath108 is scaled linearly as a function of @xmath109 [ see fig .  [ nomag_scaling ] ( b ) ] and",
    "the slope is @xmath110 .",
    "it means that the spectrum diverges as @xmath111 for @xmath92 .",
    "moreover , the position of the low - energy maximum , @xmath112 , approaches to @xmath113 as @xmath24 goes to @xmath113 .",
    "we can then confirm that @xmath103 has a singularity with exponent @xmath110 at @xmath102 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath28 .",
    "this is consistent with the exact result which shows the @xmath101-divergence of @xmath103 at the lower edge @xmath102 .",
    "in this work , we demonstrate successful application of both the obc and the pbc to the ddmrg calculation in the 1d @xmath0 heisenberg model .",
    "each of the boundary conditions has advantages and disadvantages , and then we need to make proper use of the boundary conditions depending on the situation .",
