    "in the world around us , quarks and gluons do not exist as free particles because they are permanently bound into hadrons by the strong interaction . at very high temperatures and densities however ,",
    "hadronic matter is expected to undergo a phase transition to a new state of matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , where quark and gluon degrees of freedom are not anymore confined inside the hadrons  @xcite .",
    "such temperatures and densities were present in the early universe until the first microseconds after the big bang .",
    "not only in the early universe , but also in heavy - ion collisions at ultra - relativistic energies it is possible to reach temperatures and energy densities well above the phase - transition point .",
    "the highest temperatures and energy densities are currently reached in collisions of heavy - ions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "measurements of the collective expansion of the qgp , in particular the azimuthal anisotropies in the expansion  @xcite , provide us with constraints on the properties of the system such as the equation of state ( eos )  @xcite and transport coefficients like the kinematic viscosity , defined as the shear viscosity over entropy ratio ( @xmath0/s ) .",
    "the collective expansion , also called flow , originates from the initial pressure gradients in the created hot and dense matter .",
    "these pressure gradients transform the initial spatial deformations and inhomogeneities of the created matter into momentum anisotropies of the final state particle production , which are experimentally characterised by so - called flow harmonics  @xcite . for recent reviews",
    "see  @xcite    based on asymptotic freedom  @xcite in quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) and color debye screening  @xcite , the properties of the qgp were expected to be similar to a weakly interacting gas of quarks and gluons . in that case",
    "the mean free path in the qgp is large , which implies a large viscosity .",
    "a direct consequence of a large viscosity is that the system will not develop strong collective expansion .",
    "therefore the discovery of a very large @xmath1 order flow harmonic  @xcite , called elliptic flow , at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and more recently at the lhc  @xcite changed dramatically our understanding of the qgp .    currently , the buildup of this large flow is theoretically best understood in a relativistic viscous hydrodynamic model description . in these models",
    "the large flow is understood by assuming that the system is , very quickly after the collision , in local equilibrium and forms a strongly coupled quark - gluon liquid . only after it was realised that already a small kinematic viscosity significantly reduces the buildup of the elliptic flow  @xcite , it became clear that the system produced behaves as an almost ideal or inviscid fluid , which is a fluid that has almost no resistance to shear stress .",
    "while lattice qcd calculations can calculate precisely quantities like the eos of the qgp , they unfortunately currently provide little guidance to dynamical quantities like the kinematic viscosity .",
    "it turns out that in a strongly coupled n = 4 super - symmetric yang mills theory with a large number of colors ( the so - called t hooft limit ) , @xmath0/s can be calculated using a gauge gravity duality and is found to be 1/4@xmath2 ( in natural units ) . using the famous ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , kovtun , son and starinets conjectured that this value of @xmath0/s is a lower bound for all fluids ( the kss bound )  @xcite .",
    "we therefore call a fluid with @xmath0/s = 1/4@xmath2 a perfect fluid .    for many other fluids , like helium , nitrogen , and water ,",
    "the transition from one phase to another occurs in the vicinity where the kinematic viscosity has a minimum .",
    "therefore an accurate measurement of the kinematic viscosity as function of the qgp temperature would help pinpoint the location of the cross over qcd phase transition  @xcite .",
    "after the first observation of the large elliptic flow at rhic  @xcite it was quickly realised that reported measurements of the elliptic flow included contributions from event - by - event fluctuations  @xcite , which were not included in the theoretical description .",
    "currently we have strong evidence that these event - by - event fluctuations of the anisotropic flow coefficients are mainly due to the event - by - event fluctuations of the initial spatial deformations and inhomogeneities of the produced matter  @xcite .",
    "the low kinematic viscosity of the qgp makes it possible that traces of these initial spatial distributions survive the complete dynamics of the expansion until the final freeze - out stage .",
    "therefore , measurements of the event - by - event distribution of the flow coefficients ( or the mean values and moments of the distribution ) and their correlation provide , not only , a unique way to determine the kinematic viscosity of the qgp but also strongly constrain the unknown initial conditions .",
    "the experimental determination of the kinematic viscosity and constraints on the initial conditions can only be achieved with precision flow measurements combined with an accurate model description of the complete dynamics of the produced system , that is from the initial conditions up to the point where the produced particles do not re - interact anymore .",
    "collisions of heavy ions at lhc energies produce a system with temperatures that are well above the strong phase transition temperature and are therefore a unique tool to create and study hot and dense qcd matter and its phase transition to ordinary hadronic matter in the laboratory . like the early universe ,",
    "the hot and dense system created in a heavy - ion collision will expand and cool down . in this time evolution",
    "the system probes a range of energy densities and temperatures , and possibly different phases .",
    "the evolution of the created system can be divided in two characteristic periods . during the formation of the system collisions with large momentum transfer",
    "occur and during this period the largest energy density is created .",
    "the system will thermalize and form the qgp provided that the quarks and gluons undergo multiple interactions . due to the thermal pressure",
    ", the system undergoes a collective expansion and eventually becomes so dilute that it hadronizes . in the hadronic phase it further cools down via inelastic and elastic interactions until it becomes non - interacting ( the freeze- out stage ) .",
    "this collective expansion we call flow .",
    "therefore , the observation of collective flow signals the presence of multiple interactions between the constituents of the medium produced in the collision .",
    "more interactions usually leads to a larger magnitude of the flow and brings the system closer to thermalization .",
    "flow is therefore an observable that provides experimental information on the equation of state and the transport properties of the produced qgp .     ,",
    "scaledwidth=99.0% ]    heavy ions are extended objects and the system created in a head - on collision is different from that in a peripheral collision .",
    "therefore , collisions are categorized by their centrality . theoretically the centrality is characterized by the impact parameter @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ centrality ] ) which is , however , not a direct observable .",
    "experimentally , the collision centrality can be inferred from the measured particle multiplicities if one assumes that this multiplicity is a monotonic function of @xmath3 .    in the most central collisions ( small impact parameter @xmath3 )",
    "the spatial distribution of the created system is approximately azimuthally symmetric , and the resulting azimuthally symmetric expansion is called radial flow . for more peripheral collisions",
    "the interaction volume changes roughly into an almond shape and due to its spatial anisotropy the expansion will be different as function of azimuth .",
    "this gives rise to so - called anisotropic flow .",
    "experimentally , the most direct evidence of collective flow comes from the observation of anisotropic flow , which is the anisotropy in particle momentum distributions correlated with the flow symmetry plane .",
    "the various patterns of anisotropic flow are characterised using a fourier expansion of the event averaged azimuthal particle distribution : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mean number of selected particles per event , @xmath6 the azimuthal angle , and @xmath7 the mean angle of the @xmath8-th harmonic flow plane .",

[ fouriercoeff ] is expressed only in terms of cosines , the imaginary part of the second line is zero . in this fourier decomposition , the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 are known as directed and elliptic flow , respectively .      because the flow angle is not a direct observable the anisotropic flow ( eq .  [ fouriercoeff ] ) can not be measured directly , therefore it is usually estimated using azimuthal correlations between the observed particles .",
    "two - particle azimuthal correlations , for example , can be written as : @xmath16 in eq .",
    "[ twoparticleflowestimate3 ] we have factorized the azimuthal correlation between the particles in a common correlation with the flow angle ( anisotropic flow @xmath17 ) and a correlation independent of the flow angle ( nonflow @xmath18 ) . if @xmath18 is small , eq .",
    "[ twoparticleflowestimate3 ] can be used to measure @xmath19 , but in general the nonflow contribution is not negligible .",
    "these additional nonflow correlations arise from e.g. resonance decays , jet fragmentation , and bose - einstein correlations .",
    "they can be suppressed by appropriate kinematic cuts ( which complicate comparisons between experiments ) or by making use of the collective nature of anisotropic flow using multi - particle correlations .    for the latter , this",
    "is done using so called cumulants  @xcite , which are genuine multi - particle correlations .",
    "for instance , the two - particle cumulant @xmath20 and the four - particle cumulants @xmath21 are defined as : @xmath22 from the combinatorics it is easy to show that @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number of independent particle clusters .",
    "therefore , @xmath26 is only a good estimate if @xmath27 while @xmath28 is already a good estimate of @xmath29 if @xmath30 ; for @xmath31 this argument leads to @xmath32 .",
    "this shows that for a typical pb ",
    "pb collision at the lhc with @xmath33 the possible nonflow contribution can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude using higher order cumulants .",
    "one of the problems in using multi - particle correlations is the computing power needed to go over all possible particle multiplets . to avoid this problem , multi - particle azimuthal correlations in heavy - ion collision",
    "are often calculated using so - called @xmath34-cumulants  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath34-cumulants are calculated analytically from a flow vector @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of selected particles in an event . in general this flow vector",
    "can be constructed using weights for the individual particles and the angle of this flow vector @xmath35 can be used to estimate the flow angle , similar to the first introduction of @xmath35 in  @xcite . as an example",
    "we show how the flow vector is used to calculate the two - particle cumulant .    realising that @xmath38 and using this in our definition of the individual event averaged two - particle azimuthal correlation",
    "@xmath39 we immediately see that we can express the individual event average two - particle azimuthal correlation in terms of powers of the flow vector . with the two - particle cumulant defined as the average over all events of eq  [ 2pcorrelationsingleevent ] we get : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of events .",
    "this expression already simplifies the calculation of the two - particle cumulant because it does not require a nested loop over all the particles pairs . for",

    "[ fouriercoeff ] we already mentioned that we assumed that the correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath18 is negligible .",
    "in addition the assumption was made that @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in other words , we have neglected the event - by - event fluctuations in @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the effect of the fluctuations on @xmath17 estimates can be obtained from @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the variance of @xmath17 . neglecting the nonflow terms we have the following expressions for the cumulants : @xmath46{2 \\langle v_n^2\\rangle^2 - \\langle v_n^4 \\rangle } , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "it is important to see how the heavy quarks participate in the flow  @xcite but perhaps even more interesting is understanding the large flow observed for direct photons  @xcite .",
    "while most of the measured @xmath17 were discussed in this review , the first harmonic @xmath151 was notably missing .",
    "the @xmath151 is sensitive to different interesting physics contributions  @xcite that , unfortunately , are difficult to disentangle . in this volume one review article",
    "focusses mainly on this harmonic  @xcite .    finally ,",
    "because flow is closely related to the geometry of the collision , a by - product of the flow analysis methods is the access to important orientation axes in a collision , like the orientation of the reaction - plane spanned by the beam axis and the impact parameter that connects the centre of the colliding nuclei .",
    "exploration of the sensitivity of observables to the reaction- or flow - planes opens the road to very interesting physics analyses like the detailed investigation of jet energy loss  @xcite and the possible effects of the large magnetic fields generated by the colliding nuclei  @xcite .",
    "* acknowledgements : * i would like to thank ante bilandzic , alexandru florin dobrin and you zhou for the useful comments .",

    "<S> the collective expansion of matter created in collisions of heavy - ions , ranging from collision energies of tens of mev to a few tev per nucleon pair , proved to be one of the best probes to study the detailed properties of these unknown states of matter . </S>",
    "<S> collective expansion originates from the initial pressure gradients in the created hot and dense matter . </S>",
    "<S> these pressure gradients transform the initial spatial deformations and inhomogeneities of the created matter into momentum anisotropies of the final state particle production , which we call anisotropic flow . </S>",
    "<S> these momentum anisotropies are experimentally characterised by so - called flow harmonics . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> i review alice measurements of the flow harmonics at the cern large hadron collider and discuss some of the open questions . </S>"
