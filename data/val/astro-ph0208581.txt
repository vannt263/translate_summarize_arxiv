    "this feature was identified in a relevant number of galactic globular clusters @xcite and only in a few galaxies in the local group : sculptor @xcite , sextans @xcite and ursa minor @xcite .    the rgb - bump magnitude is mainly driven by the metal content and , to a lesser extent , by the age of the population . in this _",
    "letter _ we use this feature to constrain the metallicty and age of the main stellar population in the sgr galaxy ( pop  a ) .",
    "such constraints are particularly useful in the case of the sgr dsph , where the strong foreground contamination makes a clear - cut interpretation of the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) more difficult ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter b99 and ls00 , respectively ) and where some inconsistency between the photometric and spectroscopic metallicity estimates has emerged @xcite .",
    "the data presented here consist of a sample of images obtained at the 2.2 m eso / mpi telescope at la silla , chile , using the _ wide field imager _ ( wfi ) , a mosaic of eight @xmath6 pixels ccd arrays .",
    "the scale is @xmath7 , giving a total field of view of @xmath8 .",
    "a set of v and i images in the vicinity of the globular cluster m  54 were secured during an observing run on 7 - 8 july 2000 , with typical exposure times ranging from 10 to 400 sec . to complement this data - set",
    ", we retrieved a set of public wfi images from the eso / st - ecf science archive facility .",
    "the public data were originally obtained in the framework of the eso pre - flames survey , covering a wide region of @xmath0 around m  54 .",
    "the entire data - set was homogeneously treated : in short , the raw images were corrected for bias and flat - field using standard iraf procedures , within the _",
    "noao.mscred _ package .",
    "the relative photometry was performed with the point spread function ( psf ) fitting package dophot @xcite .",
    "the stars were searched independently on each image using a spatially variable psf .",
    "we used the large overlapping regions between adjacent wfi pointings to transform the instrumental magnitudes into a homogeneous system , eventually correcting for the zero - point differences between chips and obtaining a final catalog of homogeneous magnitudes and coordinates .",
    "finally , the photometric calibration was performed using more than 1000 stars in common with the @xcite catalog ( hereafter sl95 ) .",
    "the @xmath9 cmd for @xmath1493,000 stars measured in the global field of view is shown in figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "at least three main populations can be distinguished :    ( _ i _ ) the rgb of the sgr s metal - rich population at the red side of the diagram , extending to a very red color , @xmath10 , with the corresponding , well populated red hb clump at @xmath11 .",
    "the rgb bump of the sgr can easily be seen as a clump of stars along the rgb at @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "( _ ii _ ) a second , much steeper rgb , barely visible at @xmath14 , belonging to the much metal - poorer population of m  54 .",
    "its blue hb is clearly seen at @xmath15 .",
    "( _ iii _ ) the field population , a nearly vertical sequence around @xmath16 and , at slighly redder colors ( v - i@xmath11.1 ) , the evolved milky way bulge / disk stars .",
    "the photometric properties of the sub giant branch and main sequence turn off ( to ) region ( at @xmath17 ) will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the so - called _ rgb - bump _ is an evolutionary feature predicted by the theoretical models of stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of the rgb - bump is well known : in the stellar interior during the first ascent of the giant branch , the h - burning shell is moving constantly outwards until it reaches the discontinuity in the h radial profile , left by the innermost penetration of the convective envelope inside the star . at the discontinuity ,",
    "the luminosity of the star drops for a while , until the shell adapts to the new environment , and then it rises again in a regime of constant h content .",
    "observationally , the rgb - bump appears as a peak in the differential luminosity function ( lf ) , due to the non - monotonic evolution of the star in luminosity .",
    "it appears also as a jump and a change in slope of the integrated lf , due to the change in the evolutionary rate , caused by the sudden change of molecular weight of the material in which the h - burning shell is moving . according to @xcite , the change in the slope of the integrated luminosity function is the safest way to identify the location of the bump , since it makes use of stars contained in several magnitude bins ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* f99 hereafter ) .    since its first detection in 47  tuc @xcite ,",
    "the rgb - bump has been identified in many globular clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and only recently in a few local group dwarf galaxies @xcite . in complex stellar populations , such as galaxies ,",
    "the rgb - bump appears sometimes as a double - peaked feature in the differential lf ( see the case of sculptor and sextans ) .",
    "since the rgb - bump magnitude depends on the metal content and age of the population ( f99 ) , the double - peak has been interpreted as a signature of the existence of two main stellar populations in the galaxy stellar mix @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ f2 ] , we show the differential ( lower panel ) and cumulative ( upper panel ) luminosity functions for the rgb of sgr , selected from figure  [ f1 ] . as can be seen ,",
    "more than 5000 stars have been counted along the brighter ( @xmath18 ) portion of the sgr rgb .",
    "the rgb - bump is clearly identified in both panels of figure  [ f2 ] : it is located at v@xmath19=18.55@xmath200.05 .",
    "_ this is the first detection of such a feature in the sgr dsph_. in the simplest scenario the presence of a single - peaked bump in the differential lf suggest the existence of a dominant stellar population , relatively homogeneous in metallicity and age , in the inner regions of the sgr galaxy @xcite .",
    "several authors @xcite have found evidence that the dominant population ( pop  a , in the nomenclature introduced by * ? ? ? * ) in the central part of sgr is similar to the globular cluster terzan  7 ( a member of the sgr galaxy ) , i.e. , significantly younger than the typical galactic globular but still several gyr old @xcite .    a first hint on the metal content of pop  a can be obtained by comparing the position and the shape of the sgr rgb with the ridge lines of a set of template globular clusters .",
    "such a comparison , in the @xmath21 and in the @xmath22 planes , is shown in figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "the @xmath22 cmd has been obtained by combining the catalog presented here with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) j , h , k@xmath23 dataset .",

    "* respectively ) is shown in figure  [ f3 ] . in both planes",
    "the ridge line of 47  tuc ( [ m / h]@xmath24 ) reproduces well the rgb of pop  a.    now , we can use the rgb - bump to obtain an additional , independent estimate of the mean metallicity of pop  a. in particular , we use the reddening - free and distance - independent parameter @xmath25v@xmath26 ( see f99 ) , namely the difference between the v magnitude of the rgb - bump and the zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) level . to evaluate @xmath27",
    "we followed the procedure described in details in f99 : we found v@xmath28=18.33@xmath200.07 and finally @xmath29 . using the f99 database ,",
    "we obtain a relation for the global metallicity as a function of @xmath30 : @xmath31 = -0.522(\\delta v^{bump}_{hb})^2 + 1.115\\delta v^{bump}_{hb}-0.862\\ ] ] @xmath32 from this equation we obtain @xmath33=-0.64 \\pm 0.12 $ ] for pop  a in the sgr dsph .",
    "the similarities between the sgr pop  a and 47  tuc allow us to perform a more detailed differential comparison between these two populations . in doing this",
    ", we shifted the cmd of 47  tuc ( from the dataset of * ? ? ? * ) by 4.22 magnitudes to match the pop  a red hb . as a result",
    ", we find that the rgb - bump of pop  a is significantly brighter than that of 47  tuc by @xmath34  mag .",
    "the result is confirmed by the comparison of the @xmath35 above with the @xmath36 listed by f99 for 47  tuc , giving @xmath37 mag .",
    "if the metallicity of the two populations is the same , then such a difference in the rgb - bump position corresponds to an age difference of @xmath38 gyr ( since @xmath39 , @xcite ) , pop  a being younger than 47  tuc .",
    "this finding is in excellent agreement with the results obtained by b99 and ls00 from the study of the main sequence turn off ( to ) of the sgr galaxy .    on the other hand , since at a fixed metallicity",
    "a younger age implies bluer rgb colors , we have to conclude that the mean metallicity of pop  a should be higher than that of 47  tuc ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is in good agreement with the most recent spectroscopic measures : eight of the fourteen sgr stars observed by @xcite have @xmath40 \\le -0.3 $ ] and @xmath41 > \\simeq 0.0 $ ] ( hence @xmath42=[m / h]$ ] ) .",
    "since it is reasonable to assume that these stars are representative of pop  a , we can deduce that the mean metallicity for this population is @xmath33 \\le -0.4 $ ] .    as can be seen from figure  [ f4 ] , by adopting this metallicity",
    "the observed @xmath43 suggests an age difference of @xmath44 gyr . in a scale",
    "in which the age of 47  tuc is 12 gyr @xcite , the absolute age of pop  a turns out to be @xmath45 gyr , in good agreement with the results by ls00 .",
    "the growing wealth of independent observational material about the sgr dsph is beginning to provide a self - consistent view of the properties of this galaxy .",
    "for instance , the presence of a metal poor population ( @xmath46 \\la -1.4 $ ] ) , first suggested by b99 , has been confirmed by further photometric studies ( ls00 , * ? ? ? * ) , by the analysis of the pulsational properties of the rr lyrae variables @xcite and also by the spectroscopic survey by @xcite .",
    "moreover , the existence of a significant metallicity ( and/or age ) spatial gradient , with the stars in the outer regions being more metal deficient than those near the center of the galaxy , has been put into evidence by different authors ( b99 , ls00 * ? ? ?",
    "conversely , some reason of concern was provided by the estimate of the mean metallicity of the stellar population that dominates the inner region of the galaxy .",
    "while photometric estimates were tipically in the range @xmath47\\la -0.5 $ ] , the first high - resolution spectra of two member stars by @xcite suggested a much higher metal content ( @xmath42\\simeq -0.2 $ ] ) .",
    "the larger sample provided by the spectroscopic analysis of @xcite suggests that , while stars having @xmath42\\simeq -0.2 $ ] are indeed present in sgr , they do not represent the dominant population .",
    "the majority of stars in the @xcite sample has @xmath48\\simeq 0.0 $ ] ( and thus [ fe / h]=[m / h ] ) and @xmath49 \\le -0.3 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , previous photometric estimates based on the comparison of the rgb with template globular clusters , neglected the effects of age and the difference in the @xmath50-elements enhancement , as correctly pointed out by @xcite .    in this _",
    "letter _ we have revisited the problem of the metallicity and age of the sgr main population , taking into account all of the above considerations and adding to the usual photometric metallicity indices ( i.e. , the position and the shape of the rgb ) an additional constraint provided by the position of the rgb - bump . the main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the mere detection of a single - peaked bump in the differential lf of the rgb confirms the existence of a dominant population ( pop  a ) in the sgr dsph stellar mix .",
    "2 .   the pop  a rgb is well fitted by the rgb ridge - line of the globular cluster 47  tuc , that has @xmath33\\simeq -0.6 $ ] .",
    "however , a significant difference in the rgb - bump luminosity between sgr and 47  tuc has been measured .",
    "this fact suggest that pop a is several gyr younger than 47  tuc , in good agreement with previous results based on the comparison of the main sequence turn off s ( b99 , ls00 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath33\\simeq -0.6 $ ] has to be considered as a _",
    "lower limit _ to the mean metallicity of pop  a. 3 .",
    "a full self - consistency among the spectroscopic and photometric constraints ( including the rgb - bump ) is achieved if a mean metallicity of @xmath2\\le -0.4 $ ] and a mean age of @xmath51 gyr are assumed for pop  a , in good agreement with the results by ls00 .",
    "ages younger than @xmath52 gyr are _ excluded _ by the observed morphology of the to ( see figure  11 by b99 and figure  16 by ls00 ) .",
    "the detailed discussion of this region of the cmd will be the subject of a forthcoming paper in preparation .",
