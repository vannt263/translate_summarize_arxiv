    "the relation between accretion and outflow is a key topic in modern high energy astrophysics and offers us a unique opportunity to understand the physics of distant , supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) by studying nearby , rapidly varying objects such as x - ray binaries .",
    "much of the focus in recent years has been on black holes and how accretion scales between those of mass @xmath0m@xmath1 in xrbs and those of mass @xmath2m@xmath1 in agn ( merloni , heinz & di matteo 2003 ; falcke , krding & markoff 2004 ; see also maccarone , gallo & fender ( 2004 ) ; krding , corbel & falcke 2006 ; wang , wu & kong 2006 ; mchardy et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "however , the neutron star xrbs represent an extremely valuable ` control sample ' .",
    "these systems also produce dramatic jets ( e.g. fomalont et al .",
    "2001 ; fender et al .",
    "2004 ) over a wide range of accretion rates ( migliari & fender 2005 ) . by comparing the two classes of object we can test the necessity of black hole - specific physics , such as event horizons and static limits , on the observed phenomena of accretion and jet production ( e.g. krding , fender & migliari 2006 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note that while variations in the flux of xte j1701 - 462 between epochs could cause artefacts in such a combined map , we consider it highly unlikely that they could produce the extended structure seen in fig[wide ] .",
    "furthermore , this structure is visible to a varying degree in longer individual runs ( runs b , f , m , n , o and p ) .",
    "the obvious initial interpretation of this structure is that it is an unrelated background radio source , probably extragalactic .",
    "however , based on the source counts from the atesp 5 ghz deep survey ( prandoni et al .",
    "2006 ) , we would only expect @xmath3 sources in the 1.5 - 2.5 mjy range in a region the size of the map presented in fig[wide ] .",
    "sources b , c and d are all in this range . in addition , if we consider that sources a  d are a single extended source , for the integrated flux density , @xmath4 mjy , the atesp survery indicates a mean angular size of @xmath5 arcsec , much less than the @xmath6 arcsec angular extent of the source(s ) .",
    "furthermore , the simbad   database lists no catalogued objects at this location .",
    "xte j1701 - 462 appears to lie in a region of the sky which is overdense in bright , compact , 5 ghz radio sources .",
    "the possibility must therefore be considered that the source to the south may be related in some way to the x - ray binary .",
    "if so , it appears to take the form of a curved , one - sided radio jet ( there is no comparable structure to the north ) . at an angular separation from the x - ray binary of three arcmin and a distance of 5 - 15 kpc , the physical separation of components a  d from xte j1701 - 462 greater than @xmath7 cm , which at face value seems to rule out an association with the 2006 january outburst , as apparent velocities greater than @xmath8 would be required ( but see fender et al .",
    "2004 for the intriguingly similar case of cir x-1 ) .",
    "further radio observations to look for variability and more diffuse structure are planned , as are observations at other wavelengths .",
    "in 2006 janauary a new x - ray transient , xte j1701 - 462 , was discovered , and rapidly established to display the characteristics of a z - type neutron star x - ray binary . in this paper",
    "we report on the variable radio counterpart to this x - ray source , which demonstrates a coupling between x - ray state ( branch of the z ) and radio luminosity similar to that of the other z sources . by analogy with sco x-1 and cir x-1 ,",
    "we interpret this as telling us about the connection between accretion flows and the production of a relativistic jet .",
    "fortunately , since its activation , xte j1701 - 462 has remained a bright x - ray source ( as of 2007 may ) and provides us with a new laboratory in which to study these phemonena .",
    "furthermore , there is some evidence that the source is powering a large - scale radio jet , which hints not only at phases of past activity but also at the possibility of a nebula which may be used to constrain the integrated jet power and provide a further direct comparison between jets from neutron stars and those from black holes .",
    "rpf would like to thank simone migliari for providing his data for fig 4 , and derek moss for assistance with radio source counts .",
    "we would also like to thank the referee for suggesting , and the editor for insisting , that we check on the expected source counts .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the extreme flexibility of the schedulers and observers at the australia telescope compact array who supported these observations .",
    "the atca is run by atnf for csiro ."
