    "over the last decade the ( im)possibility of creating a time machine has been animatedly discussed in the literature ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the obvious reason is that after a specific ( however unrealistic from the technical point of view ) recipe for building a time machine was proposed in the noted paper @xcite the problem of causality violations drastically changed its status . until then causality in classical gravity had been perceived as something like an additional postulate .",
    "there is no observational evidence that we live in an acausal ( gdel s , say ) universe , so the problem generally had been dismissed as purely academic . the paper , however , drew attention to the fact that within general relativity causality is not given once and for all .",
    "even if the universe is causal at the moment it does not mean that it can not be _ made _ acausal in the future ( by some advanced civilization ) .",
    "one might not have been interested in achievements of a hypothetical civilizations , but the very fact was worrisome that one could not predict the outcome of a simple thought experiment ( the manipulations with a wormhole proposed in @xcite ) , or rather that the predicted result ( appearance of a time machine ) was considered by many as inappropriate .",
    "the attempts to quickly put the jinnee back in a bottle failed .",
    "we understand now that causality can be protected neither by a shortage of ` exotic matter ' , nor by the instability of the cauchy horizons , as it was initially suspected @xcite . indeed , exotic matter is necessary @xcite for the creation of time machines ( tms ) with compactly generated cauchy horizons ( ctms ) , but it was shown that quantum effects can produce such matter in amounts sufficient to sustain a traversable wormhole @xcite and hence a wormhole based time machine .",
    "besides , ctms are only a particular type of the time machines .",
    "no reasons are known ( see @xcite and section  [ res - ns ] ) to consider them as something ` better ' ( more physical , or more feasible ) than the tms with non - compactly generated cauchy horizons ( ntms ) while the latter often do not require exotic matter at all .",
    "similarly , nothing suggests that ntms must suffer the instability . and even the ctms while exhibiting , indeed , the instability in a few cases , in a few other do not ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "there remains , of course , the possibility that each ( type of the ) time machine is impossible by its own reasons , but it does not look too plausible .",
    "thus it seems appropriate now to turn attention to the most controversial issue related to the time machines  the time travel paradoxes . on the one hand , these paradoxes seem to be something inherent to time machines ( their main attribute , perhaps ) , so it is reasonable to assume that if there exists a universal law prohibiting the time machines , it must have something to do with the paradoxes . and",
    "on the other hand , be the problem of paradoxes satisfactorily solved there probably would be no need to look for such a law , the ( supposed ) paradoxicalness of the time machines being traditionally the main objection against them .",
    "the aim of this paper is to consider the time travel paradoxes in full detail .",
    "two questions will be our primary concern :    [ [ are - the - time - machines - associated - with - any - paradoxes - in - the - first - place ] ] _ 1 .",
    "are the time machines associated with any paradoxes in the first place ? _ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the answer , which once seemed obvious ( the famous grandfather paradox was formulated 70 years ago and is known now in dozens of versions , see @xcite ) , in the last decade has been getting less and less clear .",
    "the point is that an argument like ` a time traveler can kill his grandfather before the former s father was conceived , but then the traveler would not be born , so nobody would kill his grandfather , etc.' while suggesting , of course , that time travel may be attended by paradoxes does not _ prove _ it . in particular",
    ", we have no way of modeling this situation with the necessary accuracy and so plenty of room remains for all sorts of resolutions which are abundant in science fiction ( traveler can change his mind , or can kill a wrong person , etc . ) . to find a non - trivial paradox",
    "thus one needed a much simpler story , which could have been modeled in such detail as to take into account all relevant factors .",
    "one possibility was the polchinski paradox @xcite  a ball gets into a time machine , travels to the past and hits its younger self so that the latter misses the time machine and thus can not later hit itself , etc .",
    "a few attempts were made ( see @xcite for example ) to construct a specific example of this paradox . for a wormhole based time",
    "machine @xcite the problem still turned out to be too hard mathematically , but for the deutsch - politzer spacetime a paradox eventually was claimed to be found @xcite .",
    "later , however , it was shown @xcite that this paradox is only _ apparent _ : it is not the causality violation that leads to the paradox , but some illegal global condition imposed on the physical content of the model ( see the end of subsection  [ defin ] ) .",
    "thus though it is widely believed that the existence of time machines must lead to some paradoxes in fact not a single such paradox has ever been found .",
    "moreover , in the only model where ( due to its exceptional simplicity ) the question has been fully analyzed the paradoxes were found to be lacking @xcite .",
    "so , it might appear that time travel paradoxes in fact do not exist . in this article",
    "we argue that this is not the case .",
    "we start by giving in section  [ anal ] a definition of the time travel paradox .",
    "this is necessary because a great variety of different things are called paradoxes in the literature ( undeservedly , as a rule ) . for example , the terms ` person ' , ` one borne by a woman ' , or ` one whose grandfather was not killed in infancy ' are essentially synonyms .",
    "so the question ` why a time traveler ( or whoever else ) did not manage to kill the traveler s grandfather ? '",
    "is not a bit more meaningful than the question ` why is a ball round ? ' still , after all such ` pseudoparadoxes ' are ruled out a situation remains for which the name ` paradox ' is fully justified .",
    "the paradox appears as the inconsistency ( due to local physical laws ) of what takes place in a _ causal _ region with the fact that the time machine will come into existence .",
    "thus it is not the grandfather paradox , but rather a story about a mad scientist who builds a time machine intending that after it is finished ( say , on thursday ) he will commit a bizarre suicide  on saturday he will enter the time machine , return to the friday , and shoot his younger self dead .    in section  [ expex ] we build a sufficiently simple toy model ( it is a flat universe populated exclusively by pointlike massless particles ) and use it to prove the existence of the paradoxes by constructing a specific example .",

    "does not let the time travel paradoxes into general relativity  whatever happens in a causal region , a spacetime always can evolve so that to avoid any paradoxes ( at the sacrifice of the time machine at a pinch ) .",
    "the resulting spacetimes sometimes ( see example  [ mw ] ) curiously remind one of the many - world picture .",
    "in this section i specify exactly what i call the time travel paradox .",
    "the final definition will be given in subsection  [ defin ] after the components of the initial ( rough ) definition formulated in subsection  [ def - n ] are analyzed .",
    "a great many seemingly paradoxical situations are discussed in the literature ( one even can encounter the ` sexual paradoxes ' separated into a special category @xcite ) .",

    "so it does not enter the time machine , so it will not be hit , so it enters , etc . ' ) with the plain statement that the laws of motion of the ball _ are incompatible _ with its initial state we have not lost anything paradoxical . indeed",
    ", that mind - boggling circle is nothing more than a proof ( by contradiction ) of the incompatibility : ` suppose the ball evolves from that initial state according to these laws , then it would have to hit its former self , ....",
    "q.  e.  d. '    all known ( to me ) time travel paradoxes fit in the above formulation .",
    "whatever interesting there is in science fiction beyond the above statement ( a traveler returning to a world different from what he remembers , or the universe disappearing in order not to allow of a paradox , etc . )",
    ", it all relates to ` why is it a paradox ? ' , or ` how to cope with paradoxes ? ' , but not to ` what kind of situations should be called the time travel paradoxes ? ' in particular , i shall not consider the so - called ` bootstrap paradoxes ' @xcite as a separate class .",
    "such paradoxes can be represented , for example , by a story about an engineer , who departs to the future , reads the patent disclosures on some device , returns to ` his ' time and does patent it @xcite .",
    "where did the idea of this invention come from ? in another version @xcite the protagonist receives a note ( with a very helpful clue ) from his older self , keeps this note in his wallet and when ( his ) time comes hands the note to the addressee  to his younger self . who wrote the note ?",
    "generally , this class comprises the situations in which the initial data are compatible with the equations of motion , but the solutions look counterintuitive by whatever reason ( often because a ` lion ' ( see below ) is necessary to achieve the compatibility ) . confronting a bootstrap paradox we have a choice : either we find a specific law which is violated ( converting thus the bootstrap paradox into an ordinary one ) , or we must admit that the situation",
    " however strange it might be  is not a paradox at all .",
    "an important part of the definition in question are the words ` due to ' .",
    "indeed , it seems unreasonable to call the incompatibility of an initial state with laws of motion ` a time travel paradox ' unless we have at least _ some _ reason to believe that this incompatibility takes place _ due to _ the presence of a time machine and not just _ in _ its presence . the natural criterion for distinguishing the two situations would be whether or not arbitrary initial data are compatible with these laws in a _ causal _ world .",
    "thus , in defining the time travel paradox it makes sense to restrict ourselves to the laws that are not ` paradoxical ' in the causal worlds . before formulating the relevant condition , however , we have to solve a preliminary problem .",
    "the point is that generally one can not compare the laws of motion in two different spacetimes ( a causal and an acausal in our case ) .",

    "_    in the 4-dimensional case the procedure is the same , but the cuts are made along the cubes @xmath2 instead of the segments .",
    "correspondingly , the singularity in this case appears as a result of removing the 2-dimensional boundaries of the cubes ( not just four points ) .",
    "_    the dp space is sometimes regarded as something contrived and unphysical ( an attitude which is hard to substantiate within the regular general relativity , cf .",
    "section  [ res - ns ] ) . in this connection note",
    "that the surgery by which we obtained the dp space is just a convenient way to describe its structure .",
    "one can as well define the minkowski space as result of an appropriate surgery applied to the dp space .",
    "now consider the two - dimensional deutsch - politzer spacetime populated by particles of two kinds .",
    "let us call them @xmath3- and @xmath4-particles and depict their world lines with single and double lines respectively .",
    "we assign a vector ( ` momentum ' ) to each particle  null to an @xmath3-particle and timelike to a @xmath4-particle  and require the world line of any particle to be a ( segment of ) straight line parallel to its momentum ( physically speaking , we describe a world with two types of particles  massive and massless  and with pointwise interaction ) .",
    "the laws of motion will be the following .",
    "the world lines can terminate only in vertices . outside a small region @xmath5 around the origin of the coordinates ( the shadowed region in figure  [ nelphys]b ) the particles do not interact ( an intersection of world lines does not make a vertex ) . inside @xmath5",

    "however , one can hardly use this situation as a model for a time travel paradox , since this field may not possess an evolution ( for given initial data ) even in causal ( though not globally hyperbolic of course ) spacetimes as well .",
    "an example of such a spacetime is the misner space with a ray @xmath25 removed from the acausal part .      in the next subsection we shall return to the discussion of the definition , but now let us dwell on a fundamental , though sometimes overlooked property of time machines .",
    "the systems in consideration are classical .",

    "for example , @xmath27 in figure  [ lions]a can be interpreted as a normal particle emitted in @xmath30 and later ( by its clock ) absorbed there .",
    "the fact that entering a time machine one can meet there an object whose existence it was impossible to predict is of great importance not only for resolutions of particular paradoxes ( an unexpected hungry lion behind the door of a time machine could effectively reconcile the traveler s freedom of will and his grandfather s safety ) , but for the very concept of the paradox . indeed ,",
    "most if not all of paradoxes proposed in the literature are based on some ( implicit , as a rule ) assumptions about presence of looping or intruding objects  from now on i shall use abbreviation _ lions _ for them  and their properties . for example , the puzzling piece of paper figuring in @xcite ( see subsection  [ def - n ] ) is a typical lion .",

    "a possible way to obviate the problems with uniqueness of evolution would be to fix the ` initial data ' ( they are not initial data in the ordinary sense as we argue below ) for all relevant particles _ including _ lions . in the case of the dp space for example , it could be done ( see figure  [ grfath]a ) by choosing the surface @xmath31 to be the ` initial surface ' .",

    "_    the ` trivial paradoxes ' ( see example  [ tr ] ) that we ruled out by adopting our definition constitute the vast majority of what is traditionally considered as paradoxes ( these are the grandfather paradox and its numerous modifications ) .",
    "still our understanding of what is the time travel paradox is not new : `  if there are closed timelike lines to the future of a given spacelike hypersurface , the set of possible initial data for classical matter on that hypersurface can be heavily constrained compared with what it would be if the same hypersurface with the same local interactions were embedded in a chronology - respecting spacetime ' @xcite .",
    "the simplest model of the time machine  the dp space  unluckily for our purpose does not harbor paradoxes ( at least when the physics is simple enough ) @xcite .",
    "so for a paradox we have to choose a spacetime with a slightly more complex geometry .",
    "perform the same manipulations as in constructing the dp space ( see example  [ neloc ] ) , but this time glue the upper bank of the lower cut to its counterpart only after it is _ reflected _ with respect to the @xmath35-axis . in other words a point with @xmath36 of this bank is now glued to the point with @xmath37 of the other bank ( not to the point with @xmath36 as it was in the dp case ) .",
    "the resulting spacetime  let us call it _ the twisted deutsch - politzer ( tdp ) space _  is non - orientable though still time - orientable , of course .",
    "note that in the tdp space a null geodesic ( see curve 1 in fig  [ dp]b ) entering the time machine always has a self - intersection .",
    "the world in our model is populated by massless pointlike particles ( that is particles moving along null geodesics that terminate only in vertices ) .",
    "two parameters are assignd to each particle  the ` color ' ( @xmath38 ) and the ` flavor ' ( @xmath39 ) with the possible values @xmath40 we write @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 , @xmath43 , etc . ) for a particle with the color @xmath38 ( respectively , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) and the flavor @xmath39 ( respectively , 1 , -1 ) .",
    "the particles do not interact ( an intersection of their world lines does not make a vertex ) , with a single exception  when two particles of the same kind ( i.  e.  of the same color and flavor ) meet , they change their flavor ( see figure  [ physpar ] )",
    ".    the laws of motion guarantee that in pair collisions the left outgoing particle differs from the left incoming one.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    _ remark . _",
    "if required , one can adopt another ( though equivalent in the case at hand ) point of view and speak not about penetrable particles , but about particles that bounce from each other with their parameters changed according to figure  [ physpar ] .",
    "let us consider the system with the initial data posed as shown in figure  [ paradox ] : at some moment ( the surface @xmath26 ) preceding the appearance of the time machine there are three particles  of three different colors  moving so that they must get into the time machine .",
    "all possible trajectories are shown kinematically compatible with the data fixed at @xmath26.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    these initial data do not allow any evolution , indeed . to see this consider the would - be trajectories of the particles after their collision with the lion @xmath46 .",
    "there remain only two lions ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) that can be met on their way .",
    "so , there will be at least one particle  let it be the red one ( @xmath49 ) for definiteness  which will not collide any more with a lion of the same color : @xmath50 its world line ( if it existed ) would be the geodesic 1 in figure  [ dp]b .",
    "it is easy to see that no flavor can be assigned to the particle on the segment @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , on the ( open ) segment @xmath52 of its world line it does not experience collisions with other red particles and hence its flavor can not change . hence the flavor  along with the color  on the segment @xmath53 must be the same as on @xmath54 , which is prohibited by the local physics ( see figure  [ physpar]b ) .",
    "_ remark . _    insofar as we discuss _ penetrable _ particles it is not always possible to assign a particular color to each world line .",
    "two or three particles with the different colors may have the same world line ( it can be , for example , any of the geodesics @xmath55 in figure  [ paradox ] ) forming thus a ` composite ' particle .",
    "such a particle , however , will be sterile . according to the laws specified in subsetion  [ phys ]",
    "interaction occurs only when _ two _ particles ( with the same colors ) meet and hence a composite particle passes through any other particle ( composite , or not ) causing no changes .",
    "the paradox constructed in the previous subsection satisfies all our requirements .",
    "however , it has two ( slightly ) objectionable features .",
    "first , the spacetime is non - orientable .",
    "second , the transformation @xmath56 though not being an isometry still strongly resembles it .",
    "so , appealing to condition ( c1 ) one might argue that the existence of the vertex @xmath57 ( see figure  [ physpar]b ) should imply the existence of the vertex @xmath58 , which would destroy the paradox .",
    "we shall show now that in the four - dimensional case both these ` flaws ' can be eliminated .    to build the spacetime that we shall use , repeat the construction of the four - dimensional dp space as is described in the beginning of section  [ def - n ] , but before gluing the cubes @xmath59 and @xmath60 rotate one of them by @xmath61 in the @xmath62 plane .",
    "the resulting spacetime @xmath63 is orientable and the transformation @xmath64 does not even resemble an isometry any longer .",
    "at the same time the two - dimensional section @xmath65 of @xmath63 is exactly the tdp space .",
    "we can not construct a paradox this time by simply using the same initial conditions and physics as in the two - dimensional case .",
    "the singularities now are formed by the ( former ) boundaries of the cubes .",
    "so , there may be infinitely many lions colliding with the initial particles , in contrast to the 2d case where there were only 3 such lions . to handle this problem",
    "we shall slightly modify the local physics .",
    "namely , in addition to color and flavor we assign to each particle a null vector @xmath66 which parallel propagates along the world line of the particle and does not change in collisions .",
    "we require that particles 1 and 2 should not interact unless @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the four - velocity of the @xmath69th particle , and when holds they should interact exactly as in the two - dimensional case .",
    "the so chosen laws guarantee that a particle with @xmath66 lying in the @xmath70 plane can interact only with the lions whose world lines also lie in this plane . thus restricting consideration to this plane and choosing @xmath66 for the three initial particles",
    "as is shown in figure  [ paradox ] we reduce the problem to the two dimensional one and obtain a paradox .",
    "in the previous section we proved that the problem ( the time travel paradox ) really exists . now let us discuss how to solve it .    three things  the set of local physical laws , the initial data , and the causal structure of the spacetime ",
    "individually ( supposedly ) allowed , turned out to be in conflict .",
    "correspondingly , ( at least ) three ways out are seen .",
    "the system in our toy paradox was governed by exceedingly simple laws .",
    "one might conjecture that the paradox is just a result of this simplicity while the real ( much more rich ) physics is free from paradoxes and any initial data are admissible irrespective of the causal structure .",
    "it is impossible to _ refute _ ( or to prove , for that matter ) this conjecture , but , on the other hand , it is not obvious why a more complex and detailed theory must lead to fewer rather than to more paradoxes .    also one can just _ ignore _ the paradoxes . after all only _ some _ ( but not all imaginable ) initial conditions are realized in the universe .",
    "so , one can argue that the question ` why this or that particular situation is forbidden ? ' is senseless , while the ` correct ' question is ` whether this situation is realized in the ( unique ) existing universe ? ' all complications arising then with the notion of free will is a problem rather philosophical than physical . in my opinion , however , this approach is somewhat too universal to be interesting .    finally , the third possibility is to question the feasibility of the spacetime geometry involved in the paradox . instead of asking whether _ time travel _ is associated with paradoxes",
    "one can ask whether _ general relativity _ is associated with them .",
    "the difference between the two questions is that in answering the latter we must consider the geometry of the universe not as a given background , but rather as a part of the system , on the same terms as the would - be time traveler . correspondingly a paradox now",
    "must be defined as an inconsistency of some initial data fixed ( in a causal region ) for a material system _ and _ a spacetime with their laws of evolution . by the ` laws of evolution of the spacetime ' we understand ( as we restricted ourselves to classical gravity ) the postulate according to which",
    "the universe is described by a maximal ( that is inextendible ) time - orientable spacetime , the latter being defined as a smooth four - dimensional hausdorff manifold with the lorentzian metric obeying the einstein ( or other similar ) equations .",
    "the two definitions of a paradox are equivalent only as long as we neglect any influence of matter on the geometry and also believe in uniqueness of evolution of the spacetime .    that the evolution of a spacetime is not fixed uniquely by initial data and that due to this fact the existence of a time travel paradox does not necessarily entail anything paradoxical from the relativistic point of view can be immediately exemplified by the paradox constructed in the previous section .",
    "indeed , the initial data ( including the geometrical part ) fixed at @xmath26 are , in fact , quite _",
    "compatible _ with the laws of motion ( though not with all possible evolutions agreeing with these laws ) .",
    "in particular , the spacetime may evolve just in the minkowski space .",
    "the three particles will fly unimpeded in this space and no paradoxes will arise .",
    "it may appear that so can be resolved only paradoxes involving some special types of the time machine ( e.  g.  the time machines with the non - compactly generated cauchy horizons ) .",
    "indeed , the whole concept of the time machine as something made by human beings ( as opposed to something appearing ` spontaneously ' like the deutsch - politzer time machine ) is based on the assumption @xcite that one can _ force _ a spacetime to evolve into a time machine ( cf .",
    "` the potency condition ' of @xcite ) , or to put it otherwise that there exist such initial conditions that a spacetime evolving from them would inevitably produce a time machine . however , this assumption is , strictly speaking , utterly groundless within the limits of pure ( i.  e.  without any additions to the above postulate ) general relativity . in this theory _ no spacetime at all _ evolves uniquely .",
    "whatever extension @xmath71 one takes to be a possible evolution of the initial spacetime @xmath63 , there always exists another spacetime @xmath72  infinitely many such spacetimes , in fact  which also presents a possible evolution of @xmath63 .",
    "for example , one can remove a 2-sphere @xmath73 from @xmath74 and take the universal covering of the resulting space @xmath75 as @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "note , in particular , that locally @xmath76 and @xmath72 are isometric and thus neither of them is preferable from the point of view of the einstein equations and consider the universal covering @xmath77 of @xmath78 . @xmath77 has the same topology as @xmath72 , but ( in the general case ) a different geometry . ] .    to overcome such a disastrous lack of predictability one usually restricts one s consideration to some particular class of spacetimes , that is in effect one introduces a new ( additional to that formulated above ) postulate in the theory .",
    "not infrequently it is something like ` a spacetime must remain globally hyperbolic as long as possible ' ( among the other possibilities is the requirement that a spacetime should be hole - free ) . though incorporation of this postulate ( after appropriate refining ) could give rise to an interesting theory we shall not consider it in the present article because , anyway , such an ` improved relativity ' fails at the cauchy horizons that bound ( as in the case of the wormhole - based time machine , or the misner space ) _ maximal _ cauchy developments .",
    "a spacetime has infinitely many extensions beyond such a horizon and _ none _ of them is globally hyperbolic .    as there are no grounds in the theory to prefer a particular class of extensions the only remaining way to construct a paradox would be to find such initial data in the causal region that _ all _ possible evolutions would lead to formation of a time machine in the future .",
    "this , however is impossible .",
    "the following theorem can be proved @xcite : _ any _ spacetime @xmath63 has a maximal extension containing no closed causal curves except perhaps those lying in the past of @xmath63 .",
    "_ example .",
    "_    let @xmath63 be the causal part of the misner space ( see figure  [ maslfi]b ) .",
    "there are two [ mw ] well - known ` natural ' ways @xcite to extend it to the whole misner space ( i.  e.  to a cylinder with closed timelike curves in it ) .",
    "but there are also infinitely many ways to extend it to a maximal _ causal _ spacetime . for example ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , let @xmath76 be the misner space with the ray @xmath25 cut out from the acausal part . take a sequence @xmath79 , @xmath80 of copies of @xmath76 .",
    "for each @xmath81 glue the right bank of the cut in @xmath82 to the left bank of the cut in @xmath83 .",
    "the resulting spacetime is a causal maximal extension of @xmath63 .",
    "if desired ( see @xcite ) the abovementioned theorem could serve as basis for postulating causality .",
    "what is more pertinent to the present paper , it proves that _ there are no time travel paradoxes in general relativity _ : for any system governed by laws satisfying ( c1,c2 ) any initial data are allowed in a causal region of the universe .",
