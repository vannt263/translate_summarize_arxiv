    "over the decades , many efforts have focused on observing , understanding , and controlling interactions between particles in the ultracold regime .",
    "recent progress in laser cooling technology has made it possible to explore ultracold collisions between neutral atoms and ions , which have so far been inaccessible for rigorous investigation .",
    "an ultracold atom - ion hybrid system would also provide a new scheme for the control of neutral atoms with an electric field through atom - ion interactions .",
    "furthermore , the atom - ion hybrid system has many potential applications such as atom - ion sympathetic cooling @xcite , ultracold molecular ion production @xcite , ultracold superchemistry @xcite , and local probing of quantum degenerated gases @xcite .",
    "in the course of this research , there has been pioneering work on efficient charge transfer in homonuclear atom - ion collisions @xcite , interactions between bose - einstein condensates and single ions @xcite , and chemical reactions at the single - particle level @xcite . regarding the local probing of atomic gases ,",
    "there have been several demonstrations of high - resolution imaging and state detection in an ultracold atomic system @xcite . since",
    "ultracold ions can be manipulated with an electric field that has little influence on neutral atoms , ions will make a useful state - detection head for neutral atomic gases @xcite .",
    "for the applications mentioned above , it is important to reach ultra - low temperature at which @xmath0-wave and only a few partial waves contribute to atom - ion collisions .",
    "it is also important to understand the collision properties of ultracold atom - ion systems .    in experiments involving ultracold atom - ion hybrid systems ,",
    "atoms are either trapped in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) @xcite or an optical dipole trap ( odt ) @xcite , while ions are trapped in a radio frequency ( rf ) trap that has a deep and tight harmonic potential .",
    "the motion of ions in an rf trap is considered to be a combination of secular motion and rapid rf micromotion .",
    "even though ions are stably trapped in the rf potential , there is still a finite heating due to in - phase motion ( micromotion ) of ions to the applied rf field .",
    "micromotion heating would be a serious issue in precision metrology @xcite or quantum information processing @xcite using ions , so efforts have been made to minimize the micromotion heating and suppress the doppler shift @xcite .",
    "it is also important to suppress micromotion heating in the atom - ion hybrid system because it limits the lowest accessible temperature , preventing entry into the quantum regime of atom - ion collisions .",
    "recently , cetina et al . quantitatively investigated the heating rate arising from the position shift of an ion due to atom - ion interactions , and pointed out that the incoming energy from the driving rf field becomes larger for larger atom / ion mass ratios @xcite .",
    "considering that the energy threshold of an @xmath0-wave collision is also higher for a combination of light neutral atoms and heavy ions , they concluded that the combination of light atoms and heavy ions is desirable for the study of ultracold atom - ion collisions .",
    "our system contains a combination of @xmath1ca@xmath2 ions and @xmath3li atoms that has a smaller atom / ion mass ratio than the atom - ion combinations demonstrated previously .",
    "therefore , our choice of atom - ion mixture should be less likely to suffer from micromotion heating effects , and has an advantage in creating a suitable mixture for future applications @xcite . furthermore , as we introduce a fermionic isotope of lithium atoms , a single ion may be used to measure the local thermodynamic quantities of fermionic atoms for the determination of the thermodynamic behavior of strongly - interacting fermionic atoms @xcite .",
