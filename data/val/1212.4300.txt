    "the dynamics of the solar corona are ultimately governed by the dynamics of the solar magnetic field , which is generated in the interior and brought up across the photosphere into the corona by plasma motion . as a result ,",
    "the subsurface structure and processes are likely to influence the dynamics in the corona . among all observed solar dynamical activities , coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , which eject large amounts of mass and magnetic flux from the sun to interplanetary space , are the most spectacular events .",
    "they release energy in the order of @xmath0  erg during the process .",
    "how such violent eruptions are initiated and driven , and how the processes are related to the subsurface properties of their source regions are , however , still under debate .",
    "several theories have proposed that cmes are fast expanding magnetic flux ropes driven by the twisting of the flux - rope footpoints caused by certain processes below the photosphere .",
    "the advances in helioseismology and observation have enabled examinations of local subsurface structures and dynamics at and around a small target region .",
    "several groups have utilized the tool to search for the subsurface signatures of such twisting , which would facilitate better forecasting and understanding of large flares and cmes @xcite .",
    "the common strategy has been to look for a fluid dynamics parameter that can differentiate active regions with different flaring activity levels . for instance , @xcite found that the structure component of vorticity , when combined with the total surface flux , can be used to predict c- and m - class flares .",
    "@xcite , using another parameter , normalized helicity gradient variance ( nhgv ) , reported that nhgv is able to separate non - flaring from flaring ars and also to forecast and distinguish c- , m- and x - class flares . since large flares are often associated with cmes",
    ", @xcite suggested that such subsurface parameters may be related to cme driving mechanisms .",
    "in contrast to the progress on the connection between flares / cmes and the subsurface flows of active region , little work has been done to examine the correlation between the productivity level of flares and cmes ( or eruptivity , in short ) and the subsurface structural properties that are not dynamical on the timescale of coronal eruption , which is what we wish to explore in this paper . due to the large differences in physical parameters below and above the photosphere",
    ", the characteristic time scales are expected to be longer in the convection zone than in the corona .",
    "thus , the non - dynamical part of the subsurface structure is unlikely to show detectable change over the time scale of one eruption in the corona .",
    "however , different eruptivity levels in the corona may be a result of different subsurface structures of the source regions .    in this study ,",
    "our objectives are two fold : on the one hand , we aim to better understand how cmes are initiated and driven by testing various proposed driving mechanisms using observed cme data ; and on the other hand , we explore the possibility of association , if any , between the cme productivity and the magnetic / thermal structures below their source regions .",
    "two prominent cmes and six active regions ( ars ) are studied in this work .",
    "the dynamics and possible eruption mechanisms of the cmes are examined by comparing observations with three different models .",
    "the subsurface thermal structures of the six ars , which include the source regions of the chosen cmes , are probed by the local helioseismic method @xcite . to infer the subsurface magnetic structure , we use the ratio of magnetic pressure over gas pressure ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) to represent the significance of the magnetic - field effect relative to the gaseous structure .",
    "note that @xmath2 differs from the usual plasma @xmath3 , which is defined as @xmath4 .",
    "the result of the inferred subsurface thermal and magnetic structures are depth profiles averaged over a @xmath5 patch in space and approximately 4 to 6.5 days in time .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the observations and data are described in sec .",

    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "the selected cmes are the most prominent two events during the observation period 2008 march 25  april 5 .",
    "one was from ar10989 on march 25 , and the other was from ar10988 on april 5 . for the rest of the paper ,",
    "we distinguish the cmes by the month they erupted , with `` 03 '' and `` 04 '' referring to march and april , respectively ; that is , cme03 for the one on march 25 and cme04 for the one on april 5 .",
    "we utilized the image data from stereo / secchi ( solar terrestrial relations observatory / sun earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation ; @xcite ) instruments ( euvi  171  channel , cor1 , and cor2 ) to derive the kinematics .",
    "we also incorporated the soft x - ray ( sxr ) data from goes ( geostationary operational environmental satellite ; @xcite ) 18  channel , and hard x - ray ( hxr ) data from rhessi ( reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ; @xcite ) for the associated flare information .",
    "for the investigation of eruptivity and subsurface structure , we examined the following six active regions : ar1098710989 , ar09404 , ar10980 , and ar11123 . ar1098710989 were the main ars visible on the solar surface during the carrington rotation ( cr ) 2068 .",
    "the three ars located at similar latitudes , were almost equally spaced ( cf .",
    "[ fig : mdi ] ) , but showed different levels of eruptivity : ar10989 was the source region of cme03 and an associated m - class flare , ar10988 was the source region of cme04 , and ar10987 produced neither large cme nor strong flare .",
    "ar09404 was a mature region in cr1974 . during its crossing , 2001 march 27  april 5 ,",
    "there were more than 16 ars on the solar surface , and some of them were very eruptive .",
    "however , ar09404 was relatively quiet and produced only two modest flares .",
    "ar10980 was a decaying ar , and produced one cme and an associated c - class flare on 2008 jan 2 .",
    "it had also produced several strong cmes and flares in the previous rotation , cr2064 , during which it was identified as ar10978 .",
    "ar11123 was a newly emerged ar that produced multiple cmes and flares on 2010 nov 11 , which was during the tracking time period of our helioseismic inversion ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : tab_coord ] ) .",
    "our inclusion of ars erupted within , before and after inversion intervals ; closely located ars at similar life stage ; and ars from different crs at different stages of their lives enable us to verify whether our results are dependent on factors such as temporal sequence of eruption and inversion , solar cycle , ar evolution and large scale structural differences .",
    "our helioseismology data consist of full - disk dopplergrams from the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ; @xcite ) on board the solar and heliospheric observatory(soho ) during soho / mdi dynamics runs , and the dopplergrams from the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ; @xcite ) on board the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) .",
    "we followed the same ring - diagram inversion procedure as described in @xcite to study the local structure below the active regions .",
    "in short , the ring - diagram analysis ( hill , 1988 ; patron _ et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ) was implemented to determine the frequencies of short - wavelength ( high degree ) modes in a small region of interest .",
    "these are the modes that can be approximated as plane waves over a small area of the sun .",
    "hence , long - wavelength ( low degree ) modes are excluded , and the inversion can only probe down to a certain depth . in our case ,",
    "the reliable inversion depth range is approximately the upper 3% of solar radius , or above @xmath6 .",
    "the differences between the mode frequencies in an active region and in a reference quiet region were then input to the inversion procedure to determine the difference in the structure between the two regions . for our inversion",
    ", we cut a @xmath7 patch around each target ar and also a patch around a nearby region of quiet sun ( qs ) at the same latitude . to reduce the errors due to the projection effects",
    ", we tracked the target ar only while it is close to the disk center .",
    "the exact tracking times and coordinates of the ars are listed in table  [ tab : tab_coord ] .",
    "the models we selected for our study are the catastrophe ( ca ) model @xcite , eruptive flux - rope ( ef ) model @xcite , and breakout ( bo ) model @xcite .",
    "an illustration of the three models is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmemdls ] . in the following ,",
    "we give a review of the three models .",
    "the ca model is a two - dimensional flux - rope model derived under the condition of ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "the configuration of the model , which is obtained by solving the grad - shafranov equation , consists of a flux rope in equilibrium and two line sources at the photosphere ( cf .",
    "[ fig : cmemdls]a ) .",
    "the flux rope is driven out of balance when the photospheric sources _ slowly _ move toward each other .",
    "the motion at the photosphere is assumed to be much slower than the alvn time scale at the corona such that the evolution of the flux rope can be considered as a sequence of force - free equilibria @xcite .",
    "the magnetic equilibrium of the system is lost when the separation of the two sources becomes less than a critical distance .",
    "the flux rope is then thrown upward by the imbalance between the upward magnetic pressure and downward magnetic tension forces .",
    "the height where this loss of balance happens is called critical height , @xmath8 . after the loss of equilibrium , the behavior of the flux rope is determined by the dynamics of the system . in order for the erupting flux rope to escape the solar surface to become a cme , the model proposes that magnetic reconnections must occur ; otherwise , the flux rope would stop rising once it finds a new equilibrium and its kinetic energy is dissipated . to allow magnetic reconnections after the initial eruption , which is an ideal mhd process",
    ", the model proposes that a current sheet , or x - line , forms below the erupting flux rope .",
    "the field lines inside the current sheet are no longer frozen to the plasma but can move through each other , resulting in the reconnection .",
    "because the topology of the magnetic field configurations changes after the formation of a current sheet and after the magnetic connections , the calculation of the model is divided into several stages ( see * ? ? ? * for detail ) . for the initial eruption when the flux - rope radius can be considered to be much smaller than the critical height , @xcite derived an analytical expression for the velocity of the flux rope : @xmath9^{1/2 } + \\dot{h}_0 , \\label{eqn : ca}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the height of the flux rope , @xmath11 is the initial height , and @xmath8 is the critical height . in the model , magnetic reconnection",
    "is assumed to occur at the mid - point of the current sheet .",
    "the magnetic reconnection rate is taken to be the rate of magnetic flux crossing the reconnection point , which is related to the electric field in the current sheet according to faraday s law : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the reconnection point , @xmath14 is the magnetic flux passing through the current sheet , and @xmath15 is the electric field in the current sheet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , @xmath15 is a direct representation of the prescribed reconnection rate . in the model",
    ", @xmath15 is assumed to be the same everywhere along the current sheet .",
    "@xmath15 can also be written as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the alfvn speed , and @xmath18 is the magnetic field along the current sheet .",
    "@xmath19 is alfvn mach number , where @xmath20 is the velocity of the plasma flowing into the current sheet .",
    "hence , the reconnection rate is essentially parameterized by @xmath21 .",
    "different flux - rope motion can be produced by tuning @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite varied @xmath21 to examine the effect of the reconnection rate on the cme motion .",
    "they found that if @xmath21 is not greater than @xmath22 , the flux rope would oscillate around an equilibrium height when the downward and upward forces become balanced again .",
    "for an intermediate reconnection rate , that is , @xmath23 , the cme would go through a brief deceleration phase after the initial loss of balance and then accelerate again to reach peak acceleration .",
    "when @xmath24 , the deceleration phase ceases to happen .    to identify a cme as driven by the ca mechanism ,",
    "we consider if the initial eruption starts _ before _ the rise of sxr emission and can be described by eq .",
    "[ eqn : ca ] ; the rest of the kinematics can qualitatively be re - produced by tuning @xmath21 in the manner as described by @xcite ; and the signatures of the magnetic reconnections appear _ below _ the flux rope and _ after _ the on - set of the eruption . as an example for the last point",
    ", @xcite found in their simulation that the reconnection rate did not rise above zero until seven minutes after the initiation .",
    "the ef model is formulated based on ideal mhd @xcite .",
    "the two dominant forces acting on a flux rope in the initial equilibrium are an outward lorentz self - force , resulting from the toroidal electric current ( @xmath25 ) in the flux rope , and a downward lorentz force due to the flux - rope toroidal magnetic field @xmath26 and the ambient coronal magnetic field .",
    "an increase of @xmath25 , causing an increase of the outward force , would destablize the flux rope , leading to an accelerated expansion . in the model ,",
    "the increase of @xmath25 is represented by the increase of the poloidal magnetic flux @xmath27 of the flux rope , where @xmath28 is the speed of light and @xmath29 is the self - inductance of the current system . in short",
    ", the eruption results from a positive @xmath30 .    in the model , the electric current of the flux rope , composed of toroidal ( @xmath25 ) and poloidal ( @xmath31 ) components ,",
    "is assumed to be confined in a current channel of major radius @xmath32 and minor radius @xmath33 .",
    "the configuration is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmemdls](b ) . the resulting magnetic field of the flux rope is also composed of toroidal ( @xmath26 ) and poloidal ( @xmath34 ) components . @xmath26",
    "is confined within the current channel while @xmath34 can extend beyond @xmath35 .",
    "the outermost surface of the flux rope is defined at @xmath36 , which is where @xmath34 becomes comparable to the ambient coronal magnetic field .",
    "the ambient field is generated by the current _ outside _ of the flux rope .",
    "the equation governing the radial motion of the centroid of the flux - rope apex is as follows ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath37 + f_g + f_d , \\label{eqn : ef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the mass per unit length ; @xmath39 is the height of the flux - rope centroid ( ce ) ; @xmath40 is the poloidal magnetic flux ; @xmath29 is the self - inductance ; @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the major and minor radius of the flux rope ; @xmath41 is the toroidal magnetic field averaged over the minor radius ; @xmath42 is the poloidal field at @xmath43 ; @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the average internal pressure and @xmath46 the ambient coronal pressure ; @xmath47 is the ambient coronal field perpendicular to the flux rope ; @xmath48 is the internal inductance ; and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the gravitational and drag forces .",
    "the motion for the leading edge ( le ) , top of current channel ( cr ) , and the prominence ( pr ) are derived by setting @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "since the minor radius @xmath33 also changes in time as the flux rope expands outward , the following equation is incorporated in the model calculation to account for the dynamics of the minor radius : @xmath54    to explain cme - associated solar flares and sxr emissions , @xcite proposed that the non - zero @xmath30 would induce an electromotive force ( emf ) , @xmath55 , which would accelerate charged particles leading to the sxr emissions .",
    "they suggested that an observational indication of such mechanism would be a coincidence between the temporal profile of sxr and @xmath30 . to test this proposal , we incorporated the comparison between the sxr profile and @xmath30 in our analysis .",
    "lastly , we compare @xmath56 of the ca model in eq .",
    "[ eqn : recrate1 ] and the @xmath57 of the ef model . from the sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmemdls](a ) , we can see that in order to satisfy the conservation of magnetic flux , an increase of the magnetic flux passing through the current sheet should be equal to the increase of the magnetic flux surrounding the flux rope , which is the poloidal magnetic flux .",
    "in other words , @xmath58 at the reconnection point corresponds to @xmath57 of the flux rope .      for a cme to be driven by the bo mechanism @xcite",
    ", the source region must have a multi - polar magnetic - field configuration , and must contain a system of magnetic arcades , specifically , a central arcade , two side arcades and one overlying arcade .",
    "the central arcade is what would later become the cme , and the shear motion at the foot points is what drives the central arcade to rise against the overlying arcade .",
    "the process from the rising of a central arcade to becoming a cme consists of three sets of reconnections : the first set of reconnection , occurring between the rising central arcade and the overlying arcade , removes the confinement , and is called `` breakout '' .",
    "the second set of reconnection cuts off the current sheet formed below the rising central arcade , and allows the cme to escape from the solar surface .",
    "after the central current sheet is cut off , the side arcades move in , and form a new current sheet .",
    "the last set of reconnection occurs in this newly formed current sheet , and reforms the magnetic fields in the low corona .",
    "the 2.5d topological evolution of this breakout process @xcite is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmemdls](c ) .",
    "the bo model is calculated by mhd simulations .",
    "the only driver of the instability in the simulation is the shear motion of the central arcade @xcite .",
    "neither reconnection rate nor poloidal magnetic flux injection rate is included in the model .",
    "@xcite , however , found that the poloidal flux of the newly formed flux rope increases rapidly during the first 1000 sec of the eruption while the toroidal flux of the same structure remains constant .",
    "this behavior is the same as that in the ef model .",
    "@xcite noted that there was no twist in their system prior to eruption .",
    "hence , the increase of the poloidal flux was due to the reconnection converting the overlying field into the poloidal field of the flux rope . in the bo simulations ,",
    "the rate of reconnection depends on the grid - based numerical dissipation .",
    "we can see that all three cme models agree that the eruption is associated to the increase of the poloidal flux of the erupting flux rope .",
    "the cme kinematics of the bo model have been produced by several mhd simulations @xcite . by tuning the initial conditions , these simulations generated very different acceleration profiles .",
    "the authors suggested that the bo mechanism can reproduce different observed cme acceleration profiles by varying the initial parameters .",
    "since the bo model simulations are unavailable for our study , we can not verify this suggestion , nor can we make accurate and quantitative comparisons between this model and the trajectories of our two selected cmes .",
    "nevertheless , based on the description of the model , we can deduce a number of possible observable signatures of a cme driven by the bo mechanism : the source region is multi - polar , the cme is formed / emerged from an arcade system , brightenings of source regions and formation of side arcades occur _ after _ the cme has erupted , and indications of reconnections can be seen both before and after the cme lift - off , and located both above and below the cme flux rope .",
    "to examine the dynamics of the cmes , we followed the same analysis procedure as described in @xcite . in brief , we qualitatively and quantitatively compared the observations with the predictions from the three selected models .",
    "the purpose was , on the one hand , to verify the models and their assumptions , and , on the other hand , to extract the physics of the cmes from the verified models .",
    "for the qualitative comparison , we examined various observable properties and phenomena related to the cmes , such as the geometry and morphology of the candidate source structures , sxr and hxr light curves during the process of the events , and flares and filament eruptions associated with cmes .",
    "these observed properties and sequence of phenomena were compared with the scenarios proposed by the three models to see if any of the models is consistent with the observation . for the quantitative comparison , different theoretical trajectory profiles were fit to the observationally determined trajectory .",
    "the fitting profiles implemented are eq .",

    "cme03 was observed by both secchi a and b instruments .",
    "the distance of the cme front from the sun was determined as follows : the cme front in each synchronized a- and b- image pair was traced simultaneously using the solarsoft procedure scc_measure.pro .",
    "the coordinates of the tracing points were then used by the procedure to calculate the true distances of the points from the solar center .",
    "this procedure was repeated ten times at every time step .",
    "the height of the cme leading edge ( le ) was determined as the average of the ten trial apex heights .",
    "noticing that the spread of our ten trial heights was generally comparable to @xmath611% of the determined height , we chose the larger between 1% of the determined height and the spread of the ten trial heights as the observational error .",

    "@xcite detected the flux rope at an earlier time and lower height .",
    "their kinematics plot showed that the velocity reached approximately 300  km / s and acceleration was @xmath62 km / s@xmath63 at @xmath61  18:44  ut , which is consistent with our * values ( cf .",

    "however , the ca fit deviates from the data points after @xmath6119:10  ut while the ef continues to follow the observation up to the last observed point .",
    "this indicates two things :",
    "one is that the ef formulation is valid through the entire cme process , and the other is that under the formulation of the ca model , the ideal mhd process becomes inappropriate after the initial eruption , and magnetic reconnections must occur to accelerate the cme to reach the observed speed . to obtain an estimate of the reconnection rate ,",
    "we use the same computation algorithm and model configuration as implemented in @xcite except that the source - region magnetic field strength is set to 40 gauss , which is approximately the value averaged over a @xmath7 patch around ar10989 , and then tune the alfvn mach number @xmath21 until the code produces a kinematic profile that qualitatively resembles the observational one . since the plasma condition and the configuration of the flux rope are built - in to the code and un - adjustable , the comparison between the computed profile and the observation is only qualitative .",

    "because the ef model does not include radiation or radiation - plasma interaction , it is beyond the scope of this paper to address the decay time scale .",

    "we should point out that the occultation of the sxr emission by the solar limb and the fact that the ef model does not include radiation mechanism inevitably contribute to the discrepancy .",
    "to investigate possible association between eruptivity and subsurface structure of an active region , we applied local helioseismic inversion techniques @xcite to probe the subsurface structures of six ars , and consulted the following resources for the information of relevant flare and cme activities : http://www.solarmonitor.org , noaa / usaf active region summary , and http://cor1.gsfc.nasa.gov / catalog/. in the following , we give a brief description of the principle of helioseismic inversion .",
    "the turbulence in the near - surface layer of the sun excites pressure waves that propagate through the solar interior at the sound speed . since the sound speed increases with temperature",
    ", the waves are totally refracted at specific depths according to their wave lengths .",
    "the longer the wave length , the deeper they can penetrate .",
    "the refracted waves travel upward , and are reflected at the surface due to the large density drop across the surface . in other words , these waves travel through and resonate between the surface and a specific depth .",
    "they manifest themselves as doppler shifts at the solar surface , of which the observed patterns can be decomposed into different spherical harmonic modes .",
    "the observed frequencies of these pressure modes ( p - modes ) depend on the structure and dynamics of the layer inside the sun they travel through .",
    "helioseismic inversion is a procedure to infer the unobservable internal structure and dynamics from these observable frequencies .",
    "the application of the inversion procedure to localized regions on the solar surface is called local helioseismic inversion .",
    "the purpose of local helioseismic inversion is to reveal local non - uniformity , such as flow patterns or structural differences . in this study ,",
    "the subject of interest is the latter , the difference in the structural properties .",
    "the starting point of helioseismic inversions is the linearization of the oscillation equations around a known solar model ( the so - called reference model ) using the variational principle .",
    "the frequency differences can then be related to the differences in the structural properties .",
    "since p - modes are acoustic waves , the adiabatic sound speed ( @xmath95 ) and density ( @xmath96 ) are natural choice of the thermal structure properties for the inversion .",
    "the relation between the differences in frequency and these two variables ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath28 and @xmath96 ) can be written as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath97 where @xmath98 are the kernels derived from the reference model , @xmath99 is the relative frequency difference of the @xmath100th mode , @xmath101 is the observational error in @xmath99 , and @xmath102 , usually called the `` surface term '' , represents the effect of uncertainties in the model close to the surface . here , @xmath103 is a measure of the mode inertia .",
    "other pairs of variables such as ( @xmath104 , @xmath96 ) can be used instead of the ( @xmath105 , @xmath96 ) pair used above .",
    "@xmath104 is the adiabatic index defined as @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is entropy .      to examine the subsurface structure of active regions ,",
    "we follow the strategy as described in @xcite , who used the frequency differences between the target active region and a reference quiet sun ( qs ) region , instead of between active regions and a solar model .",
    "the reference qs region is selected to be at a same latitude as the target ar , and both of them are tracked over a time interval centered at their central meridian passages . by doing so , we can reduce the systematic effects of projection on the frequencies and also minimize some of the effects of non - adiabaticity in the near - surface layers that are not considered in solar models .",
    "the level of surface magnetic activity is characterized by the magnetic activity index ( mai ) calculated from the mdi magnetograms , as described in @xcite .",
    "the difference in mai , @xmath108mai , between each ar and its reference qs , along with the tracking time of each target ar and the coordinates of each ar - qs pair , are listed in table  [ tab : tab_coord ] .",
    "the mode frequencies are determined by the ring diagram analysis @xcite .",
    "the ring diagrams are three - dimensional power spectra of the doppler shifts in small patches of the solar surface tracked at the carrington rate . to obtain the frequencies of different modes , we fitted the power spectrum using a model spectral profile in the manner described in @xcite .",
    "the fit parameters are then interpolated to integer @xmath109 pairs , where @xmath109 are radial and angular mode numbers of spherical harmonics .",
    "the frequency differences between ar and qs are subsequently inverted to obtain the structural properties based on the inversion equation eq .",
    "[ eqn : inv ] .",
    "the inversion was performed by the computational technique , subtractive optimally localized averages ( sola ; * ? ? ?",
    "the current standard solar model , from which the inversion kernels are derived , does not include magnetic fields because the gas pressure inside the sun is several orders of magnitude higher than the magnetic pressure .",
    "the study by @xcite showed that , even in the near - surface layer below active regions , where the gas pressure is low compared to other parts of the interior , the magnetic pressure averaged over volume is nearly 100 times smaller than the gas pressure .",
    "in other words , the effect of the magnetic fields on the structure is considered to be sufficiently small to justify the variational principle . however , while the kernel errors only contribute to the higher order terms according to the variational principle , the quality of the current helioseismic data has become capable of discerning such higher order effects .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields can affect the frequencies of waves in two ways : firstly , the magnetic fields change the thermal structure of the medium that the waves travel through , which , in turn , changes the frequencies of the waves .",
    "secondly , the plasma waves are directly affected by the magnetic fields through the lorentz force .",
    "the modification to the frequencies results from both structural and non - structural ( _ i.e. _ , lorentz force ) effects of the magnetic fields .",
    "since the two effects are inseparable in the observed frequencies , the `` structures '' revealed by the inversions could partly be due to the frequency difference caused by lorentz force on wave propagation . by using solar models that include magnetic fields and inversion kernels computed from non - magnetic reference models",
    ", @xcite showed that the `` sound '' speed revealed by the inversions in the presence of magnetic fields is in fact a combination of adiabatic sound speed ( @xmath110 ) and alfvn speed ( @xmath111 ) . to distinguish this property from @xmath112",
    ", we use @xmath113 * ( @xmath114 ) * to represent the speed obtained from the inversions , where @xmath115 is the total pressure and @xmath116 is the magnetic pressure .",
    "hence , the relation between @xmath113 , @xmath112 and @xmath117 is @xmath118 .",
    "note that the helioseismic inversion speed @xmath113 is to be distinguished from the magnetosonic speed @xmath119 .",
    "while the speed of sound is directly related to temperature , there is no simple , direct relationship between the inversion speed @xmath113 and either temperature or magnetic fields .",
    "searching for an observable representation of the subsurface magnetic structure , @xcite found an asymptotic linear dependence between @xmath120 and @xmath121 at every depth .",
    "the relation is different at different depths .",
    "they empirically derived a linear mathematical expression for each selected depth within the region where the inversion is reliable , and used the relation to infer @xmath122 .",
    "@xmath2 represents the relative importance between the magnetic - field and thermodynamical effects . the effect from a strong magnetic field",
    "would still be un - detectable if the gas pressure is much larger than the magnetic pressure .",
    "large @xmath2 means the effect from the magnetic field is large , which can result from either low gas density or strong magnetic field or both . in this study",
    ", we use @xmath122 to infer the subsurface magnetic structural difference between an ar and its reference qs region .    to probe the subsurface temperature differences ,",
    "we rewrite @xmath123 as follows : @xmath124 we can see that the difference between @xmath123 and @xmath120 can reflect the difference in temperature .",
    "we point out that the temperature difference is caused by a combination of the differences in magnetic and gas pressure . in short ,",
    "the subsurface magnetic structure in our analysis was inferred from @xmath120 and @xmath122 , and the subsurface temperature profile from @xmath125 .",

    "the profiles of @xmath125 are displayed in the rhs column , and @xmath123 and @xmath120 are plotted in the lhs column .",
    "the ars in both figures are arranged from the _ least _ cme productive ( top ) to the _ most _ cme productive regions ( bottom ) .",
    "the figures show that @xmath125 of most ars reverses its sign first at a shallow layer around @xmath126 and again at a deeper point , resulting in a positive bump below @xmath127 .",
    "the positive @xmath125 means that the temperature at this layer is higher in an ar than in its reference qs region .",
    "this feature has been interpreted as due to the accumulation of plasma that has been prohibited to move into the magnetic field of the ar . in the following discussion , we will focus on the features in the depths within which the plasma accumulation occurs and the inversion is most reliable ; that is , between @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "this region of interest is marked by the two vertical lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : dg1dc2a ] to [ fig : beta ] .",
    "we first inferred the subsurface temperature structure by inspecting the profiles of @xmath130 .",
    "we found that the magnitude of @xmath130 within @xmath131 decreases from top to bottom panels in both fig .",
    "[ fig : dg1dc2a ] and [ fig : dg1dc2b ] , suggesting a trend of smaller subsurface temperature difference for more cme / flare productive ar .",
    "this trend can be equivalently interpreted as less plasma accumulation below more cme / flare productive ars . in the paper by @xcite , who studied twelve selected ars with different mais , it was reported that the maximum magnitude of @xmath130 , within @xmath132 , generally increases with increasing mai",
    ". however , two regions that had the highest mais in their study showed unexpectedly low value . it was found that these two regions , ar9026 and ar9393 , had the highest flare index among all the ars in their study .",
    "flare index is a quantity to quantify the daily flare activity over 24 hours per day @xcite , hence , their results demonstrated another two flare productive ars that had unexpectedly small @xmath133 .",
    "based on these results , we suggest that higher flare / cme production and smaller subsurface ( @xmath131 ) temperature differences between the active regions and reference quiet sun regions may be correlated .",
    "however , a statistical study is needed to verify this suggestion .",
    "next , we use @xmath120 profiles ( black stars in the lhs panels ) to infer the subsurface magnetic structure . comparing @xmath120 of different ars between @xmath131",
    ", we can see that the profiles of ar10988 and ar10989 resemble each other but differ from the profiles of the other five ars .",
    "since the resemblance is only seen in two closely - located and cme - producing regions but not among all eruptive regions , we can deduce that it may indicate a subsurface structural connection between the two ars . the inferred subsurface magnetic - field effect ( represented by @xmath134 )",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] .",
    "most part of a @xmath122 profile resembles a reversed and magnified @xmath120 .",
    "we caution that this may be due to the simplification of the magnetic field in the solar model on which the derivation is based .",
    "the magnitude of the inferred @xmath122 is likely to be an under - estimate of the actual value @xcite , and the actual profile of @xmath122 may contain complexities that are not resolvable by our method .",
    "a solar model implemented with more realistic magnetic fields is required before better inference can be made .",
    "the objectives of this study were to investigate the driving mechanisms of cmes and to search for possible subsurface structural signatures that may be correlated with the productivity .",
    "two large cmes and six active regions , including the source regions of the selected cmes , were investigated .    to determine the driving mechanisms , we tested various proposed models using observed cme data and associated sxr / hxr emission data .",
    "our analysis showed that the ef model produced good fits to the kinematics of both cmes .",
    "the predicted foot - point separations at the bottom of corona were consistent , within 20% , with the sizes of the two source regions .",
    "the predicted poloidal magnetic flux increasing rate ( @xmath81 ) coincided with the sxr light curve associated with cme03 ( 2008 - 03 - 25 cme ) , but peaked slightly earlier than the sxr light curve of cme04 ( 2008 - 04 - 05 ) .",
    "this small discrepancy in time is consistent with the fact that the eruption of cme04 occurred slightly behind the limb from the viewpoint of goes so that the sxr emissions were initially blocked by the solar limb .",
    "however , some discrepancies between the ef model and cme04 were also found .",
    "the model acceleration peaked higher and later than the observation - derived value .",
    "the width of @xmath81 is also greater than that of sxr emission profile .",
    "these two inconsistencies imply that some assumptions related to the acceleration and sxr emission mechanisms in the model are inappropriate for this event .    for the investigation of the subsurface structure , we first implemented a local helioseismic inversion method to obtain @xmath123 and @xmath120 between active regions and their respective quiet - sun reference regions .",
    "the subsurface temperature difference of each ar - qs pair was subsequently deduced from @xmath130 , and the difference of the subsurface magnetic structure was inferred from @xmath120 .",
    "we found that the maximum magnitude of the subsurface temperature difference decreases with the cme / flare productivity of an ar .",
    "that is , the temperature difference is larger for less cme / flare productive regions and smaller for more cme / flare productive regions . an earlier study by @xcite also reported unexpectedly small temperature differences in the active regions with highest flare indices among all their studied regions .",
    "based on the aforementioned results , we suggest that there is a correlation between the productivity of cme / flare and the subsurface temperature structure .",
    "we point out that this correlation seems independent of whether being cme / flare productive is a consequence or a cause of the processes that reduce temperature difference .",
    "the inferred @xmath122 indicated that the cme03 and cme04 source regions have similar subsurface structures .",
    "the similarity may be an indication of subsurface structural connection between the two regions .",
    "the helioseismic inversion technique used in our study reveals a static picture of the subsurface structures averaged over several days ( 4  6.5 days in our case ) .",
    "the technique thus can not resolve dynamical effects that occur on a time scale shorter than several days .",
    "since the time scale for observed cme eruptions is only tens of minutes and initial / pre - eruption disturbances may only become detectable hours prior to the eruptions , we can not conclude from our analysis the exact subsurface effects that are directly correlated with the production of cmes .",
    "for instance , while the overall productivity of cmes may be directly related to the non - dynamical structural difference uncovered in our analysis , it is equally possible that the cmes are more effectively triggered by certain dynamical effects that are associated with the revealed non - dynamical structure .",
    "nevertheless , our results indicate a potential connection between the coronal eruption and the subsurface structure . as we discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : cmemdl ] , the mathematical formulations ( or numerical simulation results ) of all three selected cme models show that cme eruption is driven by an increase of the poloidal magnetic flux of the erupting flux rope .",
    "the difference is that ca and bo models explicitly propose that the increase has to result from coronal reconnection , while ef model does not specify the source of the increase .",
    "it could result from either an existing coronal field via reconnection or a sub - photospheric source @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that different non - dynamical subsurface structures may lead to different coronal magnetic field structures that may either facilitate or inhibit coronal eruptions .",
    "currently , none of these scenarios has been observationally tested or testable .",
