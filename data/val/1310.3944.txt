    "the pioneering work of einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) @xcite has over the years lead to the unfolding of several rich and arguably paradoxical features of quantum mechanics @xcite . considering a position - momentum correlated state of two particles , and assuming the notions of spatial separability , locality , and reality to hold true at the level of quantum particles",
    ", epr argued that the quantum mechanical description of the state of a particle is not complete . an immediate consequence of correlations between spatially separated particles was then noted by schrodinger @xcite in that it allowed for the steering of the state on one side merely by the choice of the measurement basis on the other side without in any way having direct access to the affected particle .",
    "the word ` entanglement ' was first coined by schrodinger to describe the property of such spatially separated but correlated particles .",
    "inspired by the early works of epr and schrodinger , a formalism for quantifying the correlations in terms of joint measurements of observables corresponding to two spatially separated particles was first proposed by bell @xcite for the case of any general theory obeying the tenets of locality and realism .",
    "bell s inequality was shown to be violated in quantum mechanics , a fact that has since been empirically validated in several subsequent experiments @xcite . from the practical point of view",
    ", quantum correlations have been used as resource in performing tasks that are unable to be achieved using classical means , leading to many interesting and important information theoretic applications , such as dense coding , teleportation , and secret key generation .",
    "developments in quantum information theory for both discrete @xcite as well as continuous variables @xcite have brought about the realization of subtle differences in various categories of correlations , for example , the distinction of quantum entanglement from more general quantum correlations , _ viz .",
    "_ , quantum discord @xcite found in classes of separable states .",
    "on the other hand , the understanding of the precise nature of correlations that lead to the epr paradox had to wait for a number of years beyond bell s derivation of his inequality , and further advances in quantum information theory . in this direction ,",
    "a testable formulation of the epr paradox was proposed by reid @xcite in the realm of continuous variable systems using the position - momentum uncertainty relation , in terms of an inequality involving products of inferred variances of incompatible observables .",
    "this lead to the experimental realization of the epr paradox by ou et al .",
    "@xcite for the case of two spatially separated and correlated light modes .",
    "similar demonstrations of the epr paradox using quadrature amplitudes of other radiation fields were performed @xcite . moreover ,",
    "a much stronger violation of the reid inequality for two mode squeezed vaccum states has been experimentally demonstrated recently @xcite .",
    "the epr criterion has been used to demonstrate entanglement in bose - einstein condensates , as well @xcite .",
    "other works have showed that the reid inequality is effective in demonstrating the epr paradox for systems in which correlations appear at the level of variances . however , in systems with correlations manifesting in higher than the second moment , the reid formulation generally fails to show occurrence of the epr paradox , even though bell nonlocality may be exhibited @xcite .",
    "a more direct manifestation of epr - type correlations has been proposed by the work of wiseman et al .",
    "@xcite , where steering is formulated in terms of an information theoretic task .",
    "using similar formulations for entanglement as well as bell nonlocality , a clear distinction between these three types of correlations is possible using joint probability distributions .",
    "wiseman et al . @xcite",
    "have further shown a hierarchy between the three types of correlations , with entanglement being the weakest , steering the intermediate , and bell violation the strongest of the three .",
    "bell nonlocal states constitute a strict subset of steerable states which , in turn , are a strict subset of entangled states . for the case of pure entangled states of two qubits the three classes overlap .",
    "an experimental demonstration of these differences has been demonstrated for mixed entangled states of two qubits @xcite .",
    "a loophole free epr - steering experiment has also been performed @xcite . the case of continuous variable states however poses an additional difficulty , since there exist several pure entangled states which do not display steering through the reid criterion based on variances of observables @xcite .",
    "in order to exploit higher order correlation in such states , walborn et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a new steering condition which is derived using the entropic uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "entropic functions by definition incorporate correlations up to all orders , and the reid criterion can be seen to follow as a limiting case of the entropic steering relation @xcite .",
    "generalizations of entropic steering inequalities to the case of symmetric steering @xcite , loss - tolerant steering @xcite , as well as to the case of steering with qauntum memories @xcite has also been proposed recently .",
    "epr steering for gaussian states has been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "it is realized though that gaussian states are a rather special class of states , and there exist very common examples of states , such as the superposition of two oscillators in fock states that are far from gaussian in nature .",
    "the non - gaussian states are usually generated by the process of photon subtraction and addition @xcite , and these states generally have higher degree of entanglement than the gaussian states .",
    "hence , non - gaussian states have applications in tests of bell inequalities , quantum teleportation and other quantum information protocols @xcite . extensions of the entanglement criteria for non - gaussian states have been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "since the steering of correlated systems has started being studied only recently , it is important to understand the steering of systems with non - gaussian correlations .",
    "a particular example of a non - gaussian state was considered by walborn et al .",
    "@xcite revealing steering through the entropic inequality .",
    "non - gaussian entanglement and steering has also been recently studied in the context of kerr - squeezed optical beams @xcite . in the present work we consider several categories of non - gaussian states with the motivation to investigate epr - steering of such states",
    "this should stimulate steering experiments using non - gaussian states .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section we present a brief review of the basic concepts involved in epr steering . here",
    "we first discuss the reid criterion for demonstrating the epr paradox , and recall its applicability for the case of the two mode squeezed vacuum state .",
    "we then discuss steering as an information processing task , and the entropic steering inequality for conjugate variable pairs . in section iii",
    ", several examples of non - gaussian states are studied for their steering and nonlocality properties . here",
    "we first consider entangled eigenstates of the two dimensional harmonic oscillator given by laguerre - gaussian wave functions that have been experimentally realized @xcite , and may be capable of useful information processing due to their high available degrees of freedom .",
    "we show the inadequacy of the reid criterion in revealing steering for such states .",
    "we then demonstrate steering using the entropic steering relation .",
    "photon subtraction from light beams is useful for generating a variety of non - gaussian states , and is thought to be of much practical use in quantum state engineering @xcite .",
    "we next study the steering properties of photon subtracted squeezed vacuum states using the entropic steering inequality .",
    "lastly , we study steering by n00n states @xcite that are regarded to be of high utility in quantum metrology . in all the examples considered , we present a comparison of the magnitude of bell violation with the strength of steering .",
    "such an analysis also brings out the comparative efficiency of the steering framework in revealing quantum correlations in a given state compared to the bell framework , that may be of practical relevance .",
    "a summary of our main results are presented in section iv .",
    "the epr paradox may be understood by considering a bipartite entangled state which may be expressed in two different ways , as @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are two orthonormal bases for one of the parties ( say , alice ) . if alice chose to measure in the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) basis , then she instantaneously projects bob s system into one of the states @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this ability of alice to affect bob s state due to her choice of the measurement basis was dubbed as `` steering '' by schrodinger @xcite . since there is no physical interaction between alice and bob , it is paradoxical that the ensemble of @xmath3s is different from the ensemble of @xmath4s .",
    "the epr paradox stems from the correlations between two non - commuting observables of a sub - system with those of the other sub - system , i.e. , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 individually . in the original formulation of the paradox correlations between the measurement outcomes of positions and momenta for two separated particles",
    "was considered . due to the presence of correlations , the measurement of the position of , say , the first particle leads one to infer the correlated value of the position for the second particle ( say , @xmath7 ) .",
    "now , if the momentum of the second particle is measured giving the outcome , say @xmath8 , the value of the product of uncertainties @xmath9 may turn out to be lesser than that allowed by the uncertainty principle , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath10 , thus leading to the paradox .",
    "the following material in this section is primarily to fix the setting for our work on non - gaussian entangled states .",
    "the possibility of demonstrating the epr paradox in the context of continuous variable correlations was first proposed by reid @xcite .",
    "such an idea has been experimentally realized @xcite through quadrature phase measurements performed on the two output beams of a nondegenerate parametric amplifier .",
    "this technique of demonstrating the product of variances of the inferred values of correlated observables to be less than that allowed by the uncertainty principle , has since gained popularity @xcite , and has been employed recently for variables other than position and momentum , e.g. , for correlations between optical and orbital angular momentum of light emitted through spontaneous parametric down - conversion @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the situation where the quadrature phase components of two correlated and spatially separated light fields are measured .",
    "the quadrature amplitudes associated with the fields @xmath11 $ ] ( where , @xmath12 , are the bosonic operators for two different modes , @xmath13 is the frequency , and @xmath14 is a constant incorporating spatial factors taken to be equal for each mode ) are given by @xmath15 where , @xmath16 and the commutation relations of the bosonic operators are given by @xmath17=1=[\\hat{b},\\hat{b}^{\\dagger}]$ ] .",
    "now , using eq.([boson_op ] ) the expression for the quadratures can be rewritten as @xmath18 ~\\hat{x } + \\sin[\\theta ] ~\\hat{p}_x , \\hspace{0.3 cm } \\hat{y}_{\\phi } = \\cos[\\phi]~ \\hat{y } + \\sin[\\phi]~ \\hat{p}_y . \\label{dless}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the correlations between the quadrature amplitudes @xmath19 and @xmath20 are captured by the correlation coefficient , @xmath21 defined as @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 . the correlation is perfect for some values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , if @xmath26 .",
    "clearly @xmath27 for uncorrelated variables .",
    "due to the presence of correlations , the quadrature amplitude @xmath19 can be inferred by measuring the corresponding amplitude @xmath20 .",
    "the epr paradox arises due to the ability to infer an observable of one system from the result of measurement performed on a spatially separated second system . in realistic situations the correlations are not perfect because of the interaction with the environment as well as finite detector efficiency .",
    "hence , the estimated amplitudes @xmath28 and @xmath29 with the help of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , are subject to inference errors , and given by @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are scaling parameters .",
    "now , one may choose @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 in such a way that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are inferred with the highest possible accuracy .",
    "the errors given by the deviation of the estimated amplitudes from the true amplitudes @xmath28 and @xmath29 are captured by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the average errors of the inferences are given by @xmath39 the values of the scaling parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 are chosen such that @xmath40 , from which it follows that @xmath41 the values of @xmath35 ( @xmath42 ) are obtained by maximizing @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "now , due to the commutation relations @xmath45=i;~~[\\hat{y},\\hat{p}_y]=i$ ] , it is required that the product of the variances of the above inferences @xmath46 .",
    "hence , the epr paradox occurs if the correlations in the field quadratures lead to the condition @xmath47    let us consider a two mode squeezed vacuum ( tmsv ) state , the expression of which is given by@xcite @xmath48 where , @xmath49 $ ] , the squeezing parameter @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the usual fock states ) .",

    "the product of uncertainties is thus @xmath69}$ ] which asymptotically reaches the value @xmath70 for @xmath71 , and this shows that the reid condition ( [ p_uncer ] ) for occurrence of the epr paradox holds .",
    "hence , the two mode squeezed vacuum state shows epr steering for all values of @xmath72 except at @xmath73 .",
    "however , the reid condition fails to demonstrate steering by more general non - gaussian states , for example , the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator , as we will show in section iii .",
    "a modern formulation of epr steering was presented by wiseman et al .",
    "@xcite as an information processing task .",
    "they considered that one of two parties ( say , alice ) prepares a bipartite quantum state and sends one of the particles to bob .",
    "the procedure is repeated as many times as required .",
    "bob s particle is assumed to possess a definite state , even if it is unknown to him ( local hidden state ) .",
    "no such assumption is made for alice , and hence , this formulation of steering is an asymmetric task .",
    "alice and bob make measurements on their respective particles , and communicate classically .",
    "alice s task is to convince bob that the state they share is entangled .",
    "if correlations between bob s measurement results and alice s declared results can be explained by a local hidden state ( lhs ) model for bob , he is not convinced .",
    "this is because alice could have drawn a pure state at random from some ensemble and sent it to bob , and then chosen her result based on her knowledge of this lhs .",
    "conversely , if the correlations can not be so explained , then the state must be entangled .",
    "alice will be successful in her task of steering if she can create genuinely different ensembles for bob by steering bob s state .",
    "it may be noted that a similar formulation of bell nonlocality as an information theoretic task is also possible @xcite , where the correlations between alice and bob may be described in terms of a local hidden variable model .    in the above situation , an epr - steering inequality",
    "@xcite may be derived involving an experimental situation for qubits with @xmath74 measurement settings for each side .",
    "bob s @xmath75-th measurement setting is taken to correspond with the observable @xmath76 , and alice s declared result is denoted by the random variable @xmath77 .",
    "violation of the inequality @xmath78 reveals occurrence of steering , where @xmath79 is the maximum value of the l.h.s . of ( [ steer1 ] ) if bob has a pre - existing state known to alice , with @xmath80 being the largest eigenvalue of the operator @xmath81 .",
    "experimental demonstration of steering for mixed entangled states @xcite that are bell local has confirmed that steering is a weaker form of correlations compared to nonlocality .    for the case of continuous variable systems ,",
    "the reid criterion is an indicator for steering , as discussed above .",
    "however , there exist several pure entangled continuous variable states which do not reveal steering through the reid criterion .",
    "an example of such a state is provided in ref.@xcite , which we also discuss briefly below .",
    "since entanglement is a weaker form of correlations compared to steering @xcite , it is clear that for such states the steering correlations do not appear up to second order ( variances ) that may be checked by the reid criterion .",
    "the reid criterion itself is derived using the heisenberg uncertainty relation involving product of variances of non - commuting observables . on the other hand , a more general form of the uncertainty relation containing correlations in all orders of , for example",
    ", the position and momentum distribution of a quantum system is provided by the entropic uncertainty relation @xcite given by @xmath82 using the entropic uncertainty relation , walborn et al .",
    "@xcite have derived an entropic steering inequality .",
    "they considered a joint probability distribution of two parties corresponding to a non - steerable state for which there exists a local hidden state ( lhs ) description , given by @xmath83 where , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the outcomes of measurements @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively ; @xmath88 are hidden variables that specify an ensemble of states ; @xmath89 are general probability distributions ; and @xmath90 are probability distributions corresponding to the quantum state specified by @xmath88 .",

    "note that ( [ steer2 ] ) and ( [ steer3 ] ) are equivalent conditions for non - steerability .",
    "next , considering the relative entropy ( defined for two distributions @xmath96 and @xmath97 as @xmath98 ) between the probability distributions @xmath99 and @xmath100 , it follows from the positivity of relative entropy that @xmath101 using the non - steering condition ( [ steer3 ] ) , the definition of the conditional entropy ( @xmath102 ) , and averaging over all measurement outcomes @xmath103 , it follows that the conditional entropy @xmath104 satisfies @xmath105 considering a pair of variables @xmath106 conjugate to @xmath107 , a similar bound on the conditional entropy may be written as @xmath108 for the lhs model for bob , note that the entropic uncertainty relation ( [ entropy_uncertainty ] ) holds for each state marked by @xmath109 .",
    "averaging over all hidden variables , it follows that @xmath110 now , using the bounds ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) in the relation ( [ cond3 ] ) one gets the entropic steering inequality given by @xmath111 walborn et al .",

    "we have computed the relevant conditional entropies using the wigner function whose non - gaussian nature plays an inportant role in demonstrating steering . for all the above examples we perform a quantitative study of the strength of steering ( determined by the magnitude of violation of the entropic steering inequality ) as a function of the state parameters .",
    "this leads to some interesting observations , especially in comparison with the magnitude of bell nonlocality demonstrated by these states .    for the lg modes one sees that the steering strength increases with the increase of the angular momentum @xmath74 , a feature that is also common to the bell violation",
    "however , for both the two - mode squeezed vacuum state as well as the single photon subtracted state derived from it , we show that the behavior of the maximum bell violation and steering strength versus the squeezing parameter are not similar .",
    "this is evident from the fact that though the maximum bell violation peaks for a certain value of @xmath211 , the steering strength rises monotonically with increasing @xmath211 .",
    "this feature clearly establishes the fact that though bell violation guarantees steerability , the two types of quantum correlations are distinct from each other .",
    "moreover , the presence of quantum correlations in such class of states may be more easily detected through the violation of the entropic steering inequality compared to the violation of the bell inequality for higher values of squeezing .",
    "finally , we study steering by n00n states . here",
    ", steering through the entropic steering condition is revealed only for @xmath200 , though the entanglement of such states remains constant with @xmath183 .",
    "this shows that entanglement is a different correlation compared to steering , as also it is different compared to bell nonlocality .",
    "the above results should be useful for detecting and manipulating correlations in non - gaussian states for practical purposes in different arenas such as information processing , quantum metrology , and bose condensates .",
    "further work on the issue of the recently proposed symmetric steering framework @xcite may be of interest using non - gaussian resources .",
