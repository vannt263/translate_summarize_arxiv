    "in many physical and chemical nanoscale systems ranging from semiconductor quantum dots to arrays of magnetic nanoparticles or nanoscale magnetic molecules , dynamic properties play a crucial role in understanding the underlying physics and in designing systems of interest for practical applications .",
    "for example , the time evolution of quantum systems into decoherence needs to be fully understood in various local environments in order to build scalable quantum computers .",
    "it is also important to investigate the spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath2 and the magnetization relaxation time for recently synthesized nanoscale magnetic systems to use them as information storage devices .    to study the dynamic properties of the systems discussed above , it is common to consider interactions of the systems with their environment .",
    "the environment is typically described as a heat bath , which has a much shorter relaxation time than the systems .",
    "depending on the physical quantities to be calculated , one has to choose an appropriate bath . to understand decoherence mechanisms in quantum dots at low temperatures ,",
    "one often considers an interaction between electron spins and a spin bath consisting of a large number of @xmath3 spins that mimic nuclear spins.@xcite to estimate the spin - lattice relaxation time in quantum dots , one should take into account electronic spins coupled to a phonon bath.@xcite in nanoscale magnetic systems such as arrays of magnetic nanoparticles , @xcite single - molecule magnets,@xcite and single - chain magnets,@xcite the effect of nuclear spins is minimal , so a phonon bath becomes more relevant than a spin bath . for a single - molecule magnet embedded in a three - dimensional lattice ,",
    "transition rates between different spin configurations have been derived from coupling to the lattice via magneto - elastic coupling.@xcite the magnetization relaxation time was estimated using these transition rates and quantum tunneling rates , being in good agreement with experimental data.@xcite for a nearest - neighbor interacting ferromagnetic ising system , transition rates were derived from a weak , linear coupling of the system to a one- , two- , or three - dimensional phonon bath.@xcite using these phonon - assisted transition rates , kinetic monte carlo simulations were performed to measure the lifetime of the metastable state or magnetization relaxation time at low temperatures .",
    "the monte carlo simulations revealed that the dynamic properties obtained using the phonon - assisted transition rates greatly differ from those using other transition rates , such as glauber @xcite or metropolis.@xcite it is known that the glauber transition rate can be derived from a coupling of a spin system to a fermionic bath.@xcite recently , it was shown that the soft glauber transition rate @xcite requires different interpretation in the form of the lifetime of the metastable state at low temperatures , although the energy barrier to reach equilibrium is the same as that for the standard hard glauber transition rate.@xcite therefore , selection of a proper bath and relevant transition rates is critical in understanding dynamic properties .",
    "the transition rates derived by park _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( two- and three - dimensional baths ) and other groups @xcite ( three - dimensional bath ) using coupling to a phonon bath , share a common feature that the rates become zero for degenerate states .",
    "very recently , the derived phonon - assisted transition rates were used to examine the nanostructure of field - driven solid - on - solid interfaces.@xcite it was found that the phonon - assisted rates provide significant differences from other types of transition rates , such as the glauber dynamics .    in this study ,",
    "targeting arrays of weakly interacting magnetic nanoparticles , single - molecule magnets , and single - chain magnets , we generalize the formalism used for an ising system in refs . to a @xmath0 model on a lattice .",
    "each spin in the model interacts via its nearest neighbors and has easy - axis single - ion anisotropy .",
    "we assume that all spins in the model are weakly coupled to a phonon bath in @xmath4 , or 3 dimensions .",
    "considering that spin relaxation occurs through first - order one - phonon emission or absorption processes , we derive transition rates for one- , two- , and three - dimensional phonon baths . in the cases of @xmath5 and 3 , some transitions or relaxation paths",
    "are inaccessible because transition rates between degenerate states vanish .",
    "this results in increasing magnetization relaxation time and energy barrier to be overcome . however , when higher - order phonon processes are included , other relaxation paths are opened up , leading to shortening of the relaxation time compared to the first - order phonon processes . the formalism for the phonon - assisted transition rates",
