    "standard cosmology is based on the inflationary paradigm , which provides a good description of the observed universe .",
    "besides a flat universe , inflation predicts a gaussian , adiabatic and nearly scale  invariant spectrum of primordial perturbations .",
    "however , inflation is lacking a clear physical support and alternative theories leading to the present universe have been investigated ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a further prediction of inflationary models is the presence of tensor perturbations to the spatial metric ( gravitational waves ) .",
    "the detection of these perturbations would be an extraordinary way to distinguish inflation from other competing scenarios and , at the same time , to constrain the properties of the inflationary potential @xcite .    the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and polarization probably offers the best means ( if not the only ) of detecting the tensor metric perturbations .",
    "in fact , in most inflationary models , the amplitude of the power spectrum for `` tensor '' temperature anisotropies is directly related to the energy scale at which the inflation has occurred . considering a single ",
    "field inflation ( to lowest order in the slow  roll parameters ) , the relation between the inflationary potential , @xmath2 , and the tensor quadrupole @xmath3 is @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the inflationary potential evaluated when the present hubble scale crossed outside the horizon during inflation .",
    "then , the `` energy scale '' of the inflation @xmath6 can be expressed in terms of the scalar quadrupole @xmath7 and the ratio of tensor to scalar quadrupoles @xmath8 . ] as @xmath9 where we have used the cobe estimate @xmath10 @xcite . however , tensor perturbations contribute to the temperature power spectrum essentially at low @xmath11 , with a roughly scale  invariant spectrum . unless the relative amplitude of tensor perturbations respect to scalar ones is large enough ( @xmath12 ) , measurements of the temperature power spectrum",
    "can only provide an upper limit on @xmath3 due to constraints imposed by the cosmic variance @xcite [ for example , wmap finds @xmath13 @xcite ] .",
    "the detectability of the contribution of tensor perturbations is much more promising exploiting cmb polarization measurements .",
    "the polarization field can be divided into a curl  free component of even parity called `` e  mode '' , and a curl component of odd parity , `` b  mode '' @xcite . while the former is generated by both scalar and tensor perturbations , b ",
    "mode polarization arises only from tensor perturbations and carries thus a direct imprint of the inflationary epoch .",
    "nevertheless , the b  mode intensity is expected to be extremely weak , and , even for optimistic values of @xmath0 , the rms signal is only a fraction of @xmath14k , less than 1@xmath15 of the level of temperature anisotropies at degree scales .",
    "future experiments will need to reach extraordinary sensitivities to be able to detect such a low signal .",
    "gravitational waves produced during inflation are not the only possible source of primordial b  mode polarization .",
    "for example , the existence of tangled primordial magnetic fields or cosmic strings would generate a vector component of metric perturbations , providing a contribution to the b  mode polarization on small angular scales @xcite . in any case",
    ", the discussion of these sources of polarization is outside the scope of this work .",
    "even if the instrumental sensitivity appears to be the biggest problem for detecting the tensor  induced polarization , important constraints come also from the presence of other sources of the b  mode polarization , as foregrounds and effects mixing cmb e and b  modes .",
    "the most relevant mode  mixing effect is due to the gravitational lensing produced by large scale structures , which converts a fraction of the cmb e ",
    "mode component to b ",
    "mode @xcite .",
    "different authors ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) presented methods to reconstruct the gravitational lensing potential using information from the cmb polarization itself and to remove the lensing contamination .",
    "the problem of a correct separation between e and b  mode in the presence of a partial sky coverage , pixelization and systematic effects has been also widely dealt with in literature ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and a suitable formalism to minimize their influence has been provided .",
    "another critical source of confusion for the detection of the cmb polarization is expected from foreground contamination . apart from the free  free emission that is not polarized ,",
    "foregrounds have been shown to have , in general , an high degree of polarization equally shared between e and b  mode : synchrotron emission is on average @xmath16@xmath17 polarized while dust and extragalactic sources are polarized from few per cents to 10 per cent or more .",
    "foregrounds are expected to dominate the sky b  mode polarization at all frequencies and angular scales , even for high values of @xmath0 . on the other hand , they are also a serious problem for the cmb e  mode signal which is at most a 10@xmath15 of temperature anisotropies , but significantly less on large angular scales .",
    "a secondary b  mode polarization is also generated by scattering of the cmb photons from ionized gas in galaxy clusters or in a patchy reionization scenario ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , these effects produce a polarization that is several orders of magnitude below the dominant contributions .",
    "the main question that this paper address is how galactic and extragalactic foregrounds ( including the gravitational lensing contamination ) limit the detectability of the cmb b  mode polarization . in terms of cosmological constraints , we want to estimate the lower limit of @xmath0 ( hence of the energy scale of inflation ) under which the signal from tensor perturbations can not be distinguished by polarization measurements .",
    "the case of an ideal experiment ( i.e. , noise  free experiment ) is first considered .",
    "then , the same analysis is also applied to planned or hypothetical experiments , giving hints on the best strategy for future missions .",
    "in this section we discuss the expected level of the polarized signal for the cmb and foreground emission as a function of the observing frequency @xmath18 and the angular scale . the results are presented in figures [ f0 ] and [ f1 ] .",
    "the left plot of figure [ f0 ] shows the dominant foregrounds in the @xmath11@xmath18 space .",
    "the not  shaded area is where the cmb e  mode is higher than the foregrounds e  mode contribution .",
    "the diffuse galactic emission ( synchrotron and dust emission ) is essentially the strongest foreground in polarization . only at high @xmath11 and frequencies lower than 100ghz",
    "extragalactic radio sources start to be relevant .",
    "we notice how the `` cosmological window '' ( the @xmath11@xmath18 region where cmb exceeds foregrounds emission ) is strongly reduced as compared to temperature fluctuations , expecially at large angular scales . in the right plot",
    ", we consider the polarization level of galactic emissions but reduced by an order of magnitude ( this is , at least , what we expect to reduce in a multyfrequency experiment ) . in this case",
    ", extragalactic radio sources become an important contribution already for @xmath19 , as well as the polarization induced by gravitational lensing at @xmath20ghz . now",
    "the not  shaded area represents the @xmath11@xmath18 region dominated by the cmb b  mode polarization for a cosmological model with @xmath21 .",
    "as expected , it is confined only to @xmath22 .    in figure [ f1 ]",
    "we plot the rms value for the @xmath23 modes polarization as expected to be measured by an experiment with a resolution of @xmath24 : @xmath25^{1/2}\\ , , \\label{e1b}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the beam function of a hypothetical instrument and @xmath27 is the angular power spectrum ( aps ) of cmb or foregrounds .",
    "the rms values are given in antenna temperature .",
    "the @xmath24 resolution is chosen to estimate the rms polarization because degree angular scales are the most interesting for detecting the cmb b  mode polarization .",
    "let us see now the properties for each polarized component in detail .",
    "the cmb b  mode power spectrum ( @xmath28 ) is characterized by a peak at @xmath29 , i.e. at the angular scale corresponding to the horizon at recombination .",
    "the amplitude of the spectrum is directly proportional to the cosmological parameter @xmath0 and is related to the energy scale of inflation : at the peak the amplitude is @xmath30^{1/2}t_0\\sim \\nonumber \\\\ & \\sim & 0.3\\,r^{1/2}\\,\\mu{\\rm k } \\simeq0.03\\bigg({e_i \\over 10^{16}{\\rm gev}}\\bigg)^2\\,\\mu{\\rm k}\\ , . \\label{e2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at @xmath31 the spectrum rapidly decreases because gravitational waves oscillate and decay once inside the horizon . at very large scales very low",
    "mode polarization is also expected because , at the moment of recombination , the anisotropy quadrupole moment has not been significantly produced yet on scales larger than the horizon .",
    "however , the reionization of the universe has the effect to partially polarize the cmb radiation and shift to lower redshift a fraction of the last scattering , producing a further peak at low @xmath11 in the spectrum . the amplitude and",
    "the position of such a peak depends on the optical depth of the universe , @xmath32 [ wmap finds @xmath33 @xcite ] .    in figure 2b",
    "we report the expected values of @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( solid red lines ) . as shown in eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) , it scales like @xmath37 .",
    "if only very large scales are considered , @xmath34 is strongly dependent on @xmath32 and exceeds 0.1@xmath14k for @xmath32 and @xmath12 . on the contrary , at degree resolution , @xmath32 is less relevant but not negligible ( @xmath34 increases by a factor 2 changing @xmath32 from 0 to 0.17 ) . in the plot",
    "we consider @xmath38 ( a conservative value compared to the wmap best  fit one ) .",
    "the b  mode spectrum is less sensitive to other cosmological parameters .",
    "we fix those in agreement with the `` concordance model '' ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) .",
    "the detection of the cmb e  mode polarization is much easier than that of b  mode and it is even better with sub  degree resolution experiments ( see figure [ f0]).at these angular scales , dasi @xcite achieved the first direct measure of e  mode polarization , while more recent observations have been provided by dasi @xcite , capmap @xcite and cbi @xcite.at degree angular scales the value of @xmath43 is less than @xmath44k with a polarization degree of only few per cent or less . nevertheless , the cmb e ",
    "mode is still the dominant contribution in a wide range of frequencies , approximately between @xmath45ghz .",
    "finally , we plot in figure 2a the level of the b  mode polarization induced by the gravitational weak lensing of large scale structures ( see magenta line ) .",
    "this estimate is obtained using the cmbfast package .          among all foregrounds ,",
    "synchrotron emission is the most polarized ( up to @xmath46 ) .",
    "it is expected to be the dominant component at low frequencies ( @xmath47ghz ) . total ",
    "intensity data are available up to @xmath48ghz , while polarization observations of the synchrotron are obtained only at few ghz or less .",
    "estimates on the amplitude of the polarized synchrotron emission at cosmological frequencies are especially complicated for two reasons : the steepening of the spectral index that may occur at @xmath49ghz , and the frequency dependence of the degree of polarization .",
    "the synchrotron spectral index , @xmath50 , is computed on nearly all sky using the surveys at 408mhz @xcite , at 1.4ghz @xcite and at 2.3ghz @xcite by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these analysis show @xmath50 to vary across the sky between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , with an average value @xmath53 and a dispersion of 0.10.2 at sub  degree angular resolution . a relevant steepening ( @xmath54 out of the galactic plane ) is found from the first  year data of wmap at 23ghz @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the distribution of the spectral index computed between 1.4 and 23ghz : the frequency spectrum is observed rather flat along the galactic plane , whereas steeper at high galactic latitudes with a typical value @xmath55 . a further steepening is also suggested in the 2341ghz range by @xcite , although it has to be confirmed . in the following",
    ", we shall assume @xmath55 as the mean spectral index for the synchrotron emission at all considered frequencies .",
    "estimates of the rms signal of @xmath23 modes for the synchrotron emission are reported in figure 2a ( green lines ) .",
    "a set of estimates obtained in different ways is considered , which permits to get a range of plausible levels .",
    "first we scale down unpolarized synchotron as follow : the full  sky synchrotron map at 23ghz , obtained from wmap data after component separation with the maximum entropy method @xcite and smoothed by a gaussian beam with fwhm@xmath56 , is used to compute the rms amplitude of temperature fluctuations at high latitudes ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we find @xmath58 . from the @xcite observations ( the only up  to  now available data of the synchrotron polarization on a large fraction of the sky ) , @xcite found that on degree scales the fractional polarization at 1.411ghz is typically 1020 per cent with the highest value being 35@xmath15 .",
    "taking into account that faraday rotation can reduce the polarization degree at this frequency , we assume that synchrotron emission is polarized between a 10 and a 30 per cent as lower or upper limit .",
    "we get estimates as plotted with dotted lines in figure 2a .",
    "secondly , estimates of @xmath59 can be directly achieved also from polarization data .",
    "@xcite use @xcite survey to compute the e and b  mode aps in three patches with high signal  to  noise ratio centered at the latitudes @xmath60 .",
    "they find that the aps can be well approximated by a power law with a quite flat slope , @xmath61 .",
    "taking as the `` average '' spectrum at 1.4ghz @xmath62(k@xmath63 ) , we find @xmath64k at @xmath24 resolution ( dashed line in figure 2a ) .",
    "similar results are also obtained from the analysis of high  resolution surveys at low galactic latitudes ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) : extrapolating the polarization aps provided by @xcite and @xcite to low @xmath11s , we find @xmath65k at 2.4ghz ( solid line in figure 2a ) .",
    "however , these estimates probably have to be considered as upper limits because they come from observations of the galactic plane or of highly  polarized regions .",
    "their very good agreement with the 30@xmath15wmap predictions shown by figure 2a confirms that a polarization degree up to 30@xmath15 can be observed in highly ",
    "polarized area but as it may be not the typical percentage on the sky .",
    "the upper lines in figure 2a may be somewhat pessimistic estimates .    finally , the recent observations of the high  galactic latitude polarization with the effelsberg telescope at 1.4ghz @xcite point out structures in polarization on scales of several degrees with a fractional polarization up to 3040@xmath15 in the brightest regions and a rms @xmath66 and @xmath67 signal of 50mk .",
    "this value , extrapolated to wmap frequencies , corresponds to the wmap result with an average polarization degree of 10@xmath15 ( see long  dashed line ) .",
    "nevertheless , as the polarization level at 1.4ghz can be significantly reduced by faraday depolarization , a percentage of 20@xmath15 for the polarized synchrotron emission may be more realistic at microwave frequencies",
    ". the lower lines in figure 2a are thus probably somewhat optimistic .      millimetric or submillimetric measurements of the galactic dust polarization are usually concentrated in galactic clouds and star  forming regions with arcminutes angular resolution ( e.g , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they show a few per cent polarization and no clear frequency dependence .",
    "the first observations on large angular scales of the polarization of the galactic dust emission are provided by archeops at 353ghz @xcite .",
    "the archeops data show a significantly large  scale polarized emission in the galactic plane , with a polarization degree of 45@xmath15 , with several clouds of few square degrees appearing to be polarized at more than 10@xmath15 .",
    "intensity observations at infrared wavelengths , where the thermal dust emission is very dominant , have been obtained by the iras and cobe ( dirbe ) satellites . combining these data",
    ", @xcite generated a full  sky map at 100@xmath14 m with sub  degree resolution .",
    "a tentative extrapolation of the 100@xmath14 m map to microwave frequencies was done by @xcite , assuming different dust emissivity models .",
    "they use the firas data in the 1002100ghz range to constrain dust properties .",
    "the best agreeement is met with a two  component model , consisting of a mixture of silicate and carbon  dominated grains ( see model 8 of @xcite ) . extrapolating the 100@xmath14 m map to 100ghz with this model",
    ", we find @xmath68k for a @xmath24 resolution .",
    "the dust rms intensity at this resolution can also be estimated from wmap data : using the galactic emission models by @xcite , it is found @xmath69k at 93.5ghz , significantly higher than the @xcite value .",
    "however , because in the wmap frequency range the dust emission is only a secondary contribution , this value is still controversial .",
    "the predictions on the rms polarization presented in figure 2a assume a typical polarization degree for the interstellar diffuse dust emission of 5@xmath15 , in agreement with archeops results ( dotted and dashed blue lines ) .",
    "finally , @xcite provide a model of the dust polarized emission using the three  dimensional hi maps of the leiden ",
    "dwingeloo survey at high galactic latitudes .",
    "different hypothesis on dust grain properties and alignment are assumed . as main result",
    ", they estimate the dust polarization aps at 100ghz to be @xmath70k)@xmath63 , corresponding to @xmath71k at @xmath24 resolution ( solid line in figure 2a ) .",
    "this value is significantly low compared to previous ones and require a mean polarization degree less than @xmath72 for being consistent with total  intensity results .",
    "extragalactic radio sources contribute significantly to temperature and polarization fluctuations only at small angular scales . at degree",
    "scales their polarized signal is a small fraction of the total foregrounds , even if it can exceed the cosmological b ",
    "mode for a low value of @xmath0 .",
    "predictions on the polarization properties of radio sources at microwave frequencies and on their contamination for cmb measurements are provided by @xcite , using the evolutionary model of @xcite which predicts the number counts of sources at cm and mm wavelengths . in figure 2a",
    "we report the rms polarization assuming that all sources with flux density higher than 1 or 0.2jy have been completely removed ( light blue lines ) .    at",
    "frequencies higher than 100ghz , the contribution of dusty galaxies should also be taken into account .",
    "however , the sparsity of data on polarization at sub - mm wavelengths makes reliable predictions difficult . in any case",
    ", we expect that the polarization degree from the dust emission in external galaxies is not higher than the polarization degree observed in the milky way , i.e. only a few per cent . supposing a polarization of 2@xmath15 @xcite , figure [ f0 ] shows that the dusty galaxies contribution never overcomes the other foregrounds at all frequencies lower than 1000ghz and at @xmath73 .",
    "polarization from dusty galaxies will be neglected in this work .      here",
    "we give a brief description of some secondary sources of polarized emission , although they will not be taken into account in the analysis .",
    "the existence of an anomalous dust  correlated emission , far brighter than the expected thermal dust emission , has been well detected at @xmath7430ghz ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "one possible explanation is the electric dipole emission from rapidly rotanting small dust grains , known as `` spinning dust '' @xcite .",
    "this emission is expected to be polarized if grains are aligned with the magnetic field . in any case , as shown by @xcite , the polarization is marginal for @xmath75ghz .",
    "another possibility is the magneto ",
    "dipole emission from strongly magnetized grains @xcite .",
    "the polarization due to this mechanism depends on the dust composition and structure , and can be substantial at microwave frequencies @xcite .",
    "finally , in the presence of a temperature quadrupole , the scattering of the cmb photons by free electrons in galaxy clusters leads to a secondary linear polarization .",
    "in addition to the primary cmb quadrupole , another important origin of temperature quadrupole is due to the peculiar velocity of clusters .",
    "however , the contribution to the b  mode polarization from this secondary signal is considerably low , several orders of magnitude below the lensing  induced polarization on the large scales ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ f1 ] clearly shows that the contribution of galactic foregrounds to the b  mode polarization dominates over the cmb signal at all frequencies , even in the most optimistic cases . the knowledge of foreground emissions and the ability to remove them assume therefore a primary role for the possibility of observing the polarization induced by gravitational waves .",
    "multifrequency observations are thus absolutely necessary , expecially on large scales . during last years",
    ", many methods have been suggested to perform the component separation of the microwave sky .",
    "some of them adopt bayesian approaches ( e.g. , mem by @xcite and wiener filtering by @xcite and @xcite ) whereas others blind techniques ( e.g. , smica by @xcite and fastica by @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we do not want to go into details of different techniques and assumptions for the components separation .",
    "our aim is to estimate the level of residual galactic foregrounds left in the clean maps after their subtraction .",
    "we make the following hypotheses : i ) a template for synchrotron and dust emission ( the only galactic foregrounds considered ) is available ; ii ) their spectral behaviour is estimated in the frequency range of interest .",
    "a linear subtraction of galactic foregrounds is then employed extrapolating templates to the `` cosmological '' frequency . the instrumental noise present in templates and the uncertainty on the frequency spectrum of foregrounds",
    "are taken into account in order to compute the residual polarization .",
    "compared to standard techniques for component separation , this method is , in principle , less accurate .",
    "however , it provides qualitative estimates for the residual foregrounds that are good enough for the aim of this work . moreover , its simplicity allows to compute analytically the power spectrum of residual galactic contaminants and , in addition , the method only requires minimal assumptions on the foregrounds and their statistical properties .",
    "let @xmath76 be the frequency chosen to detect the cmb polarization ( hereafter called the `` observational frequency '' ) and @xmath77 the frequency of the template for the galactic foreground we want to subtract .",
    "we suppose that the foreground frequency spectrum can be approximated by a power law ( at least between @xmath77 and @xmath76 ) : @xmath78 in general , the value of the spectral index @xmath79 is expected to change with the sky position .",

    ", these techniques have not been extended yet to polarization maps .    in any case , because we are only interested to reduce the contribution of point sources to the polarization maps , the best strategy is to exploit the total ",

    "it means that the limit of @xmath1 on the detectability of the polarization produced by gravitational waves is due essentially to radio sources and lensing , even in the case of a raw galactic foregrounds subtraction ( as in the c1 scheme ) .",
    "when extragalactic contributions are included , low  resolution experiments are much less effective to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , extragalactic radio sources are a serious problem due to the difficulty to detect and subtract them .",
    "for example , considering fwhm=@xmath178 , we find @xmath179 in the best case .",
    "an experiment with arcminute resolution could overcome the constraints imposed by extragalactic foregrounds .",
    "in fact , on the one hand , the number of arcminute pixels that can be masked to remove radio sources is much higher , reducing the flux limit to @xmath180mjy and making their contribution negligible ( also in a small area ) ; on the other hand , the high resolution ( with the `` noise  free '' condition ) allows us to reconstruct with high precision the lensing b  mode power spectrum directly from the data @xcite . in particular , we study what occurs for an experiment covering a sky area of @xmath181 in the hypothesis of a perfect subtraction of extragalactic foregrounds : the limited sky area strongly constrains the detectability of the tensor polarization , due to the cosmic variance on the low @xmath11 ( we remind that the uncertainty on @xmath0 increases proportionally to @xmath182 ) .",
    "only if galactic foregrounds are removed in an accurate way , as under the c2 conditions , @xmath139 is similar to that found for a full  sky experiment ( see the dotted line in figure [ f7 ] ) .",
    "in this section we apply the previous analysis to experiments characterized by a given sensitivity to the polarized emission .",
    "practically , it means to include the instrumental sensitivity in the noise term of the fisher matrix .",
    "we also take into account the noise in template maps in order to estimate the aps of the residual galactic polarization , by adding the term given in eq .",

    ", a large number of experiments has been planned with the explicit objective to measure the cmb polarization ( for a review on the polarization experiments see @xcite ) . however , while they may provide an accurate estimate of the e  mode power spectrum both at large and small angular scales , for the forthcoming experiments the detection of the gravitational waves polarization is still a challenge and it will be possible only for high values of the tensor  to  scalar ratio @xmath0 .    in the mid term , the planck mission satisfies the best conditions to search the `` inflationary '' polarization : a full  sky coverage and a good characterization of all the relevant foregrounds .",
    "in fact , a large frequency range is spanned and more than one frequency is dedicated to the study of the galactic foregrounds , providing adequate knowledge of their spectral behaviour and template maps in polarization . on the other hand ,",
    "the arcminutes resolution allows to detect point sources up to quite low fluxes and to have a first estimate of the gravitational lensing contribution .",
    "nevertheless , the instrumental noise is still a very strong constraint : the sensitivity to stokes parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 per square degree pixel is higher than 1@xmath14k at all the frequencies ( after 14 months ) , significantly higher than the expected rms value for the cosmological b  mode polarization . taking the 100ghz channel as the `` observational frequency '' ( and using the 30 and 217ghz channels as templates for the synchrotron and dust emission respectivelly )",
    ", we find that a 2@xmath140 detection of the gravitational waves polarization is possible for @xmath183 . this result does not change if we do not include the contribution of foregrounds .     for an experiment like planck , but with a sensitivity improved by a factor @xmath184 . in the upper ( lower ) line",
    "galactic foregrounds are subtracted following the c1 ( c2 ) scheme and extragalactic foregrounds are partially ( completely ) removed.,width=317 ]    the research of the gravitational waves polarization is also promising using ground  based experiments . as discussed above ,",
    "the disadvantage of covering a limited area of the sky can be partially compensated by the high resolution , which permits a better control of the contribution provided by extragalactic sources and gravitational lensing .",
    "experiments like polarbear ( see @xcite ) , clover @xcite or quiet @xcite are planned to achieve a very good sensitivity , of the order of @xmath185k or less , using arrays of 1000s of detectors in only two or three frequency channels .",
    "as example , we discuss in detail the case of polarbear : it will operate at the frequencies 90 , 150 and 220ghz covering 225 square degrees ; the number of detectors for each frequency should be 400 , 600 and 200 with a sensitivity per detector of 310 , 345 and 640@xmath14ks@xmath186 respectively . considering an observational time of 1.5 years with an efficiency of 30@xmath15 ,",

    "we plot the tail of the lower curve as a dotted line in order to indicate that , for so high sensitivities , it must not be considered a lower limit for the detectability of @xmath0 , since the uncertainty of foregrounds spectral index we used , @xmath122 , can be improved .",
    "we discuss now a more concrete example for a space experiment : a total of 10,000 detectors in three channels at 100 , 140 and 220ghz with the same sensitivity of planck detectors . with about 3,000 detectors for each channel , instead of 8 present in planck ,",

    "the reason is the different spectral behaviour between dust and synchrotron emission : the frequency spectrum of synchrotron is very steep and already at 100ghz its polarized contribution is small ; on the contrary , the dust spectrum decreases quite slowly with the wavelength and at 7080ghz its polarization level is still comparable to the synchrotron one .    finally , considering jointly radiometers that operate at 30 and 70ghz and bolometers at 100 and 150ghz with the features previously described , we find a sensitivity to the cmb b  mode polarization similar to the one achieved by the space mission : @xmath203 .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the constraints that foregrounds can impose on the detection of the b  mode polarization induced by gravitational waves .",
    "first of all , we carry out a detailed analysis on the expected level of the foregrounds polarization at degree scales , which are the angular scales where the cosmological b  mode signal is concentrated .",
    "the diffuse galactic emissions ( synchrotron and dust emission ) are the dominant components .",
    "the minimum of their polarized emission is found to be around 100ghz , corresponding to a rms value for the b  mode of @xmath204k at @xmath24 resolution ( to be compared with the cmb @xmath205k ) .",
    "we expect a shift of the `` cosmological window '' in polarization towards higher frequencies as compared to temperature fluctuations , where the lowest emissivity of foregrounds is observed around 60ghz .",
    "it is due to the high polarization degree of the synchrotron emission , whose diffuse component is observed to be up to 30@xmath15 polarized or more .",
    "the contribution of extragalactic radio sources and of the polarization produced by gravitational lensing is secondary on large scales , but not negligible when techniques to subtract galactic foregrounds are applied to polarization data . on the contrary , other sources of polarized emission ( such as infrared galaxies , sz effect , etc . )",
    "are expected to be negligible .",
    "the subtraction of the galactic contributions from polarization maps is mandatory to search for the gravitational waves signal . assuming component separation boils down to subtracting , at the cmb observing frequency , a set of foreground templates scaled in frequency according to a model emission law , we provide an analytical expression for the power spectrum of the residual polarization , depending on the noise in the foreground templates and on the uncertainty in their spectral behaviour .",
    "we study two concrete cases : i the frequency spectrum of galactic emissions is supposed independent of the sky direction ; ii the frequency spectrum is estimated pixel by pixel , but with an uncertainty that behaves like white noise . as expected , under this second hypothesis a better subtraction of galactic foregrounds",
    "is achieved : if only the contribution of the residual galactic foregrounds is taken into account , we find that a 3@xmath140 detection of the tensor polarization is possible for @xmath206 , corresponding to an energy of inflation of @xmath207gev . however , this value should not be considered as a lower limit for the detectability of the primordial b  mode polarization since it arises from working hypothesis .",
    "in fact , in this case , the amplitude of the residual galactic aps depends on the average uncertainty with which the spectral index is computed .",
    "we have taken @xmath122 : this value is probably reliable for the data available up to now , but it will be improved in the future . in this sense ,",
    "a limit on the detectability of the cmb b  mode polarization can not be put `` a priori '' .",
    "opposite conclusions are found if the subtraction of galactic foregrounds is based on the assumption that their spectral law is independent of the sky direction .",
    "now , the amplitude of the residual galactic foregrounds depends on the intrinsic dispersion of the spectral law in the sky ( @xmath122 ) and not on our ability to estimate it .",
    "so , the value of @xmath208 that we find for a 3@xmath140 detection corresponds to the lower limit for the detectability of the gravitational waves polarizationin this case .    clearly then , taking into account the spectral variability of foregrounds in the component separation is a key point in order to detect cosmological cmb b  mode polarization for very low @xmath0 . at the present time",
    ", only few methods have been proposed to perform the component separation with spatial variability of foregrounds @xcite showing promising results .",
    "more efforts within this field are still required .",
    "the effects of extragalactic radio sources and gravitational lensing on the @xmath0 sensitivity is also studied .",
    "after subtraction of the galactic foregrounds , they become the major contaminant also on the large scales . in principle , cmb experiments with high resolution can control accurately these foregrounds .",
    "lensing and radio sources are much more problematic for measurements with a wide beam and complementary data with high resolution are required to reduce their polarized contribution .",
    "we have seen that , for a full  sky `` noise  free '' experiment with @xmath24 resolution , a reduction by a factor 10 for the b ",
    "mode aps of radio sources and lensing is probably feasible , giving a detectability limit of @xmath1 independent of the scheme to subtract galactic foregrounds .",
    "this value is , in any case , better than those found by experiments covering only a small area of the sky , that are strongly limited by the cosmic variance .",
    "finally , we have discussed what are the prospects , `` in practice '' , for the detection of tensor polarization in the future . in the near term ,",
    "a tensor  to  scalar ratio of @xmath209 is well within reach of the planck mission and planned ground  based experiments .",
    "a detection of tensor modes with so high values of @xmath0 would be an indication of an inflation driven by some exotic physics @xcite .",
    "the next generation of missions , that are at the moment under discussion by nasa and esa , will be able to significantly improve the sensitivity on the polarized emission by means of arrays of @xmath210@xmath211 detectors , and will probably allow us to investigate more conventional theories of the inflation , spanning ranges of energy down to @xmath212gev .",
