    "biological systems display fascinating spatial and temporal patterns , which hint that the underlying cellular processes are highly dynamic and operate on a wide range of time and length - scales .",
    "this is indeed confirmed by measurements of the temporal dynamics of protein concentrations and gene expression levels for various signalling and response systems , made using pulse - labelling @xcite , @xmath1-galactosidase measurements and immunoblotting @xcite , electromobility shift assays @xcite , real time pcr @xcite , fluorescence techniques @xcite , chromatin immunoprecipitation assays @xcite and microarrays @xcite .",
    "overall , it is now evident that regulatory and signal transduction networks do not depend merely on shifting the relevant protein concentrations from one steady state level to another .",
    "rather , the signals often have a significant temporal variation that carries much more information and propogates through the regulatory networks in a complex manner . with time - resolved data now available for a number of response and signalling systems , it is perhaps the appropriate time to explore whether there are any commonalities , or  design principles \" , in the underlying mechanisms . in this review",
    "we will show that a prominent subclass of such systems does indeed have a common underlying design structure which combines a negative feedback loop with a time delay .",
    "this subclass consists of systems that display oscillatory behaviour under some conditions .",
    "the most obvious examples are circadian rhythms and cell division .",
    "oscillations are also seen in the levels of cellular calcium @xcite . and in embryo development .",
    "somite segmentation , for instance , exhibits clearly periodic spatial patterns which are produced by periodic temporal variation of proteins like hes1 , axin , notch and wnt @xcite .",
    "we also include in this class , systems which display damped oscillations or semi - periodic behaviour .",
    "one example is oscillations , triggered by dna damage , in p53 , a key protein involved in cell death and apoptosis pathways @xcite . hormones , such as the human growth factor , also show such intermittently periodic behaviour and pulsatile secretion @xcite .",
    "for these systems the recurrent behaviour probably has a direct physiological role . in cyanobacteria , for example , various physiological processes , like respiration and carbohydrate synthesis , are directly influenced by the circadian clock to be in sync with the day - night cycle @xcite .",
    "for other systems , however , clear oscillatory behaviour is not observed in the wild - type , but only in certain mutants .",
    "for instance , the nf-@xmath0b signalling system , involved in immune response in mammalian cells , shows oscillations in nuclear nf-@xmath0b concentration only in a mutant which contains just one isoform of the nf-@xmath0b inhibitor , i@xmath0b@xmath2 , and not the other isoforms @xcite .",
    "fluorescence measurements of the nf-@xmath0b system modified so that i@xmath0b@xmath2 was overexpressed also showed sustained oscillations over several hours @xcite .",
    "however , wild - type cells show at best damped oscillations @xcite . here",
    "it is not clear if the oscillations themselves have a significant physiological consequence or are merely a by - product of other requirements for the wild - type behaviour . nevertheless , the sub - parts of these systems which are potentially oscillatory are important , often essential , components which influence the complex temporally varying wild - type response .",
    "b , data taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=302 ]    we will focus on three of the regulatory systems mentioned above : hes1 in mammalian embryos , p53-mdm2 in mammalian cells , and the nf-@xmath0b signalling system , also in mammalian cells .",
    "[ fig_oscill ] shows the oscillations observed in experiments for all three .",
    "these systems are quite complicated , with many components interacting in various ways  including transcriptional activation / repression , translation and post - translation regulation , protein - protein interaction , targeted protein degradation , and active nuclear - cytoplasmic translocation  composed into a complex network with multiple feedback loops . in this review",
    ", we mainly describe the mechanisms and structures in these networks that allow them to produce the observed oscillations .",
    "we will do this using simplified mathematical models where the level of description balances the need to correctly describe the systems with the need to coarse - grain over some details in order to reveal common design features .",
    "we first begin by defining the overall framework of models we consider , and describing the basic ingredients for producing oscillatory behaviour within this framework  _ negative feedback _ and _ time delays_. in the subsequent sections we show how the three examples of he s , p53 and nf-@xmath0b contain these ingredients .",
    "therein we also elaborate , using stability analyses , the requirements for producing oscillations in these systems .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss how to extract information about underlying structures from oscillatory time series data .",
    "fig . [ schematic]a shows a schematic negative feedback loop .",
    "the individual nodes in this loop are the relevant dynamical variables : they could be protein concentrations , gene expression levels , etc .",
    "each variable either activates or represses the next one in the loop . by an activator , we mean that if the concentration of protein 1 goes up it tends to increase the concentration of protein 2 ( either by increasing its production rate or decreasing its degradation rate ) .",
    "a repressor has the opposite effect .",
    "then , a negative feedback loop is simply defined as _ a loop with an odd number of repressors _ , so that the effect of a perturbation in the concentration of any species in the loop eventually feeds back to itself with a negative sign .",
    "feedback loops are , in general , the most common network motifs in cellular organization , especially when one considers the regulation of small molecules @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on negative feedback here because it was hypothesized by thomas @xcite , and rigorously proven for a wide class of systems @xcite , that the presence of at least one negative feedback loop is a necessary condition for oscillations .",
    "the simplest negative feedback loop is of course a protein which represses itself .",
    "there are many examples of such proteins : the main repressor of the sos regulon in _",
    "e. coli _ , lexa , also represses its own production @xcite ; hes1 , mentioned above , also represses transcription of its own gene @xcite , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ schematic]b .",
    "however , hes1 looks like a one - component loop only if we coarse - grain over the intermediate steps in protein production .",
    "if we count the hes1 mrna also then it becomes the two component negative feedback loop of fig .",
    "[ schematic]c : one component , he s protein , represses the production of the second , hes1 mrna , while the second component activates the first .",
    "the other two systems we discuss later in this review have the same loop structure when coarse - grained to the two component level .",
    "nuclear nf-@xmath0b is known to activate production of i@xmath0b@xmath2 , which inhibits nuclear import of nf-@xmath0b by sequestering it in the cytoplasm @xcite .",
    "p53 and mdm2 work similarly , with p53 activating the _ mdm2 _ gene and mdm2 sequestering p53 @xcite .    to examine the possible dynamical behaviour produced by a negative feedback loop , we model the dynamics of the concentrations of the components using ordinary coupled differential equations .",
    "for instance , for the two component loops shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic]c : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the concentrations of the two components @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this can easily be generalized to longer loops with @xmath8 components : @xmath9 which models a single feedback loop with no cross - links because the rate of change of a given variable @xmath10 depends only on itself and the preceding variable , @xmath11 . in writing such an equation",
    "we are assuming that fluctuations in space and time are negligible .",
    "thus , there are no stochastic or diffusion terms",
    ". the functions @xmath12 model both production and degradation of the components , and can take many forms depending on the kind of interactions in the system .",
    "for example , in the p53 example ( with @xmath13 p53 , @xmath14 mdm2 ) , we know that p53 binds to an operator site at the promoter for the _ mdm2 _ gene and aids transcription",
    ". then , under some assumptions the production of mdm2 can be modeled using a term of the form : @xmath15 a sigmoidal monotonically increasing function of the p53 concentration , @xmath16 ( the hill coefficient , @xmath17 , accounts for cooperativity in the binding of p53 to the operator ) .",
    "it is difficult to say anything about the behaviour of the general coupled differential equation of a negative feedback loop , like eq .",
    "[ generaln ] , however , it is reasonable to constrain the functions @xmath12 of eq .",
    "[ generaln ] to be monotonic in @xmath11 .",
    "this corresponds to saying that a protein that activates a particular process can not change to repress it at some other concentration , and vice versa , which is the case for most transcription factors .",
    "promoter at low concentrations , but represses it at high concentrations @xcite .",
    "another example is the galactose regulator galr , which at high concentrations of galactose activates the promoter _",
    "galp2 _ but in the absence of galactose forms a dna loop , which completely represses _ galp2 _ @xcite .",
    "such examples are , however , somewhat rare and we will not consider them .",
    "] for monotone systems , not only is there no ambiguity about whether the loop implements negative or positive feedback , but we can also prove rigorously that there is only one fixed point ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the question then is whether such a steady state is stable or unstable . for two variables ,",
    "if the fixed point is unstable , and the system s trajectories are bounded ( again , a reasonable assumption for a biological system ) then it must show periodic oscillations : this is known as the poincar - bendixson theorem @xcite . for monotone systems",
    "this is true even when the loop has more than two components @xcite , which means that the question of whether oscillations are possible boils down to whether the fixed point is stable or unstable .",
    "physically , what is required for instability of the fixed point , and hence oscillations , is a time delay , or a slowing down of the signal going round the loop . by signal we mean perturbations of the concentrations away from the steady state .",
    "if a perturbation in the concentration of one variable instantaneously affects the concentration of the next one , and so on , then for a negative feedback loop , any perturbation will be immediately cancelled and the steady state will be stable . a sufficiently large time delay on the other hand will produce oscillations .",
    "this can be readily understood with an example : consider a person who walks along a straight line to a given point , marked on the ground .",
    "if this person is able to take instantaneous decisions , he will approach the mark and then stop .",
    "this is a stationary solution to the walk kinetics .",
    "if , on the other hand , it takes some time to realise that the mark has been reached , the person will not stop at the mark , but cross it .",
    "when eventually the information that the mark has been crossed is processed , the person will turn back and walk in the opposite direction .",
    "the mark will again be reached and overshot , and so on .",
    "the resulting kinetics will be damped or sustained oscillations about the mark . in cellular systems",
    "many processes could produce time delays .",
    "table 1 lists some timescales associated with such processes .    with the above insight",
    ", one can see that a simple way to model oscillations using the framework of eq .",
    "[ general ] is to introduce an explicit time delay into the equations : @xmath18 of course , this is the most general form , and often it is possible to have fewer than four delays .",
    "oscillations are observed even in the simplest case of a linear differential equation with a single ( sufficiently large ) delay ( see appendix c ) : @xmath19 , which models the 1-component he s loop of fig . [ schematic]b where hes1 represses itself after a time delay @xmath20 . although a linear delay rate equation is an oversimplification of hes1 production , the physics which lies behind more general delay differential equations like eq .",
    "( [ general_delay ] ) is the same .",
    "the added complication is that the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are in general highly nonlinear , resulting in an amplification of the effect of the delay .    putting an explicit time delay like this , of course , does not really shed light on the mechanism producing the time delay .",
    "there are several possibilities which can be used to produce oscillations in a negative feedback loop : +    1 .   a process that takes a finite minimum time 2 .",
    "many intermediate steps 3 .   a sharp response by some of the variables 4 .",
    "saturated degradation 5 .",
    "autocatalysis +    to elaborate : +    1 .",
    "rate equations , like eq .",
    "[ generaln ] , typically model processes which occur with a given average rate , such as the binding of a protein to an operator site .",
    "a hidden assumption is that the time interval between two binding events is poisson distributed , which means that often there is a reasonable probability for two events to be separated by a very short time interval ( say , much shorter than the average time between events ) .",
    "sometimes , however , molecular processes take a certain minimum time . for instance , if transcription and translation take a time @xmath20 after a polymerase binds to the promoter , then the rate of production of the protein is more appropriately modeled as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is 1 if the polymerase is bound to the promoter at time @xmath25 , and zero otherwise .",
    "such logic has been used to justify time - delay models in a variety of systems @xcite .",
    "this is the approach we will take to model the p53 and he s systems , discussed in the subsequent sections .",
    "processes like transcription and translation have this character because they are in fact composed of a large number of intermediate processes : the polymerase binds , first forming a closed complex , which then makes a transition to an open complex , and then to an elongating complex , followed by many  steps \" along the dna until the polymerase reaches the end of the gene .",
    "even if each of these individual steps is a poisson process , the net effect adds up to a time delay .",
    "thus , instead of putting in an explicit time delay as in eq .",
    "[ general_delay ] , one could work with a negative feedback loop with many components .",
    "one simple example of such an oscillator is the repressilator @xcite , which is a negative feedback loop with six components .",
    "the repressilator also has another necessary ingredient  a nonlinearity in the @xmath12 functions which allows some of the variables to respond to changes in the preceding variable in a faster - than - linear fashion .",
    "more precisely , the repressilator uses sigmoidal functions , like the function [ mm ] , to describe transcriptional repression , and needs hill coefficients of at least 2 in order to achieve oscillations .",
    "the earliest example of a negative feedback oscillator which uses a nonlinearity like this to produce a sharp response is a model by goodwin @xcite where the hill coefficient needs to be more than 8 .",
    "such high hill coefficients are unlikely for biological systems , however . in order to get around this  problem \" , bliss , painter and",
    "marr @xcite introduced another way of producing an effective time delay .",
    "they used the saturated degradation of one of the concentrations .",
    "saturated degradation means that there is an upper limit to the degradation rate of one species , thereby allowing it to remain abundant for a longer time , thus effectively slowing down the signal travelling around the loop .",
    "such saturated degradation is quite common in biological systems , especially when proteins are tagged for targeted degradation by another protein , as we will show in the nf-@xmath0b case discussed below .",
    "finally , autocatalysis , where a molecule activates its own production can be used to produce oscillations in systems like eq .",
    "[ general ] @xcite .",
    "in fact for two variable systems where there is no explicit time - delay this is a necessary condition for oscillations @xcite .",
    "note that this modification typically makes the system non - monotonic .",
    "this survey of the theoretical requirements for producing oscillations in negative feedback loops already allows us to make an interesting observation : monotone 2-component loops without an explicit time - delay can not oscillate , whatever the nonlinearity in the @xmath12 functions .",
    "we prove this explicitly in appendix a. thus , if one insists on modelling an oscillating system using two variables , one must choose between introducing a time delay , and sacrificing monotonicity .",
    ".time scales of some cellular processes associated with a single molecule .",

    "ultradian \" oscillations have been observed , which have time periods of the order of hours , as opposed to  circadian \" 24 hour rhythms .",
    "we will discuss specific details of each system , at the same time emphasising that the basic physical mechanism which produces oscillations in all three is the same  negative feedback along with time delays .",
    "the protein p53 is responsible for inducing apoptosis in cells with damaged dna @xcite .",
    "the concentration of p53 is usually kept low by a feedback mechanism involving another protein , mdm2 , which binds to p53 and promotes its degradation . when the dna is damaged , the cell expresses a number of kinases which phosphorylate ser20 in p53 , changing its affinity to mdm2 .",
    "this results in oscillations in the concentration of p53 , observed both in western blot analysis @xcite ( cf .",
    "[ fig_oscill](a ) ) and in single cell fluorescence experiments @xcite .",
    "the standard explanation for the overall increase in the concentration of p53 is that its phoshoprylation decreases its affinity to mdm2 , shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium towards higher concentrations .",
    "apart from not explaining the oscillations , this argument does not agree with other experimental evidence .",
    "equilibrium isothermal titration calorimetry experiments have shown @xcite that phosphorylation at ser20 _ decreases _ , not increases , the dissociation constant between p53 and mdm2 from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "the same effect is observed _ in vivo _",
    "@xcite , where p53asp20 ( a mutated form which mimics phosphorylated p53 ) binds mdm2 more tightly than p53ala20 ( which mimics unphosphorylated p53 ) .",
    "moreover , single cell experiments @xcite show a slight decrease in the concentration of p53 after dna damage , which can not be explained by the standard argument .",
    "we showed that a simple model of the p53-mdm2 system that incorporates the time delay associated with some relatively slow processes within the cell can account for the experimental facts in a simple way @xcite .",
    "the feedback mechanism is sketched in fig . [ fig_sketch](a ) and the associated time - delayed rate equations are @xmath28 where the delay @xmath20 takes into account the half - life of mrna , the diffusion time , the time needed to cross the nuclear membrane and the transcription / translation time .",

    "moreover , just after @xmath30 the concentration of p53 decreases , as observed in the experiments . finally , the concentration , @xmath39 , of the complex p53-mdm2 is , at any time , essentially identical to the minimum of @xmath16 and @xmath40 ( gray curve in fig .",

    "the value of @xmath41 displays a sigmoidal behaviour if the stress decreases the value of @xmath29 .",
    "in contrast , in the absence of a time delay , this curve is linear with respect to @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "thus , the time delay and the oscillations are crucial for producing a sensitive system that can respond to stress in a sharp , faster - than - linear manner .",
    "we also undertook a detailed analysis of the response of the oscillations to changes in the parameters @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the oscillations do not change qualitatively when parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are varied ( by upto five orders of magnitude ) , whereas a decrease in @xmath45 or @xmath46 suppresses the oscillating behaviour .",
    "these parameters are associated with , respectively , the the degradation of mdm2 and the binding of p53 to the dna .",
    "one could speculate therefore that these processes play an important role in the production of tumors that arise when the p53 response mechanism fails .",
    "this speculation is , in fact , consistent with the observation that around the 45% of all tumors display mutations in the p53 region which binds to dna @xcite .",
    "the overall behaviour of the proteins with respect to time evidently depends on the parameters of the dynamic equations , that is the production and degradation rates and the delay . over long timescales",

    "chaotic behaviour is never observed within this model .",
    "a careful analysis of how the dynamics of the protein concentration depends on the parameters of the rate equations has been done by neamtu and coworkers in ref .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that under the condition that the dissociation constant @xmath29 between p53 and mdm2 is small , there exists a critical delay , @xmath47 , above which the system shows oscillations ( see details in appendix c ) .    in the language of dynamical systems ,",
    "the transition when the delay , @xmath20 , crosses @xmath47 is a hopf bifurcation .",

    "the transcription factor hes1 controls the differentiation of neurons in mammalian embryos @xcite .",
    "its concentration is controlled by a feedback loop built out of hes1 and its own mrna ( see fig . [ fig_sketch ] ) . like p53 , its concentrations displays oscillations when the cells are stimulated with serum @xcite .",
    "the period is similar to that of p53 , approximately two hours , and the oscillations last for @xmath48 hours .",
    "hes1 is known to repress another protein called mash1 .",
    "both the knocking out of mash1 and its continuous expression by means of retroviral introduction results in a lack of cell differentiation .",
    "only when there are periodic oscillations in the concentration of hes1 ( and thus of mash1 ) is there proper differentiation of neuronal cells @xcite , showing that the temporal variation of the protein concentrations are critical for the developement of the nervous system .",
    "the relation of hes1 oscillations to segmentation and spatial patterns has been studied by several authors .",
    "it is well known that oscillations in hes1 is part of notch signalling and hirata et al ref .",

    "new cells are provided and move away from the caudal end each setting a boundary for a somite segmentation .",
    "this continues until all somites are produced which subsequently gives rise to the spinal cord @xcite .",
    "ultradian oscillations of signaling pathways are thus extremely important for segmentation .",
    "the control mechanism of hes1 oscillations again involves a negative feedback loop with one activation and one repression : the transcription of the mrna of hes1 activates the production ( translation ) of the protein , and hes1 represses the transcription of its own mrna .",
    "the main difference compared to p53 is that here one of the nodes represents an mrna , not a protein .",
    "however , this difference is merely semantic : the control network still has two nodes , of which one is activating and one is repressing .",
    "the molecular species of these nodes are immaterial to the description of the oscillations .",

    "such a large value is very unusual for biological systems , and is much larger than the values obtained by other mechanisms @xcite .",
    "after having discussed the mechanism underlying the production of oscillations and studied in detail three examples of  ultradian \" oscillations in cells , we would like to describe an easy tool @xcite capable of providing information on the architecture of the underlying network , given the experimental time series data for oscillating biological systems .",
    "more precisely , given the time sequence of maxima and minima of the concentrations of the species during the oscillations , the method allows one to assess whether the observed sequence is compatible with a a single underlying negative feedback loop , describable by eq .",

    "[ generaln ] .",
    "for such a system , we can prove the following statements about the sequence of maxima and minima in the time series :    * the extrema ( maxima or minima ) have to follow the order of the variables ; for example , after a maximum of variable @xmath98 there can either be a maximum or a minumum of variable @xmath99 , and * if two successive extrema are of the same kind ( both maxima , or both minima ) , then variable @xmath99 is activated by variable @xmath98 .",
    "conversely , if they are of opposite nature ( one maximum and one minimum ) , then variable @xmath99 is repressed by variable @xmath98 .",
    "these statements can be used to reconstruct the structure of the underlying loop from the time series , if it is compatible with the above restrictions .",
    "we illustrate this using the example of p53-mdm2 time series shown in fig .",
    "[ algorithm ] .",
    "the reconstructed loop is exactly the structure we used in eq .",
    "[ eq_p53 ] : p53 activates mdm2 , which represses p53 .",
    "of course , in this case , there are only two possible loop structures , and the correct interactions are already known experimentally so the information gained is minimal .",
    "the method comes into its own for systems with more variables .",
    "one example is the cyanobacterial circadian clock .",
    "[ cyano ] shows oscillations in the expression of three circadian clock genes in _",

    "two of the interactions have been experimentally observed in another strain of cyanobacteria @xcite , but the activation of _ kaia _ by _ kaib3 _ is a new prediction .",
    "notice that there are many possible maxima / minima sequences which are not compatible with the above rules .",
    "for example , in order to be compatible with a single loop , each species must have exactly one maximum and one minimum during one period .",
    "moreover , if the method predicts an even number of repressors , one should consider an oscillating positive feedback loop , which is impossible ( see @xcite for a full list of non  allowed cases ) .",
    "in all these situations , one should conclude that the mechanism causing the oscillations is more complicated and can not be reduced to a single feedback loop .",
    "even if the structure of the real protein interaction network is more complicated that a single loop ( which is usually the case ) , the method can hint at the interactions which are most relevant for the oscillating mechanism and help in building up a zero - order model of the system .",
    "finally , we note that while the method is mathematically rigorous for systems without time delays , it works even if there are unobserved chemical species taking part to the loop @xcite . as intermediate species introduce time delays it is likely that the result can be extended to systems with an explicit time delay added to eq .",

    "questions about cellular processes that use complex , temporally varying signals can be crudely classified into the ` how ' and ` why ' groups .",

    "do oscillations carry some information that can be decoded by downstream genes ? could a non - oscillating system have worked equally well for the cell ?    in this review",
    "we have mainly investigated the ` how ' questions for one subset of cellular response systems that use temporally varying signals : eukaryotic systems exhibiting  ultradian \" oscillations .",
    "the three systems we have modelled  p53 , which is important for apoptosis , hes1 , which is part of the notch cycle responsible for somite segmentation , and nf-@xmath0b , a key protein in immune response  all turn out to have the same basic design that produces oscillations .",
    "the two key aspects of this design are the presence of _ negative feedback _ and _ time delays_. there are many ways of producing an effective time delay in cellular processes",
    ". in particular , we emphasised , using the example of nf-@xmath0b , _",
    "saturated degradation _ as one such mechanism .",
    "saturated degradation plays a role in many models of oscillatory negative feedback  loops .",
    "the earliest use of this mechanism is in the model of bliss , painter and marr @xcite , which is similar to our nf-@xmath0b model .",
    "saturated degradation has also been used by goldbeter in various models of cellular oscillations , e.g. , the cell cycle @xcite , development in myxobacteria @xcite , yeast stress response @xcite and the mammalian circadian clock @xcite .",
    "it is also found in models of calcium oscillations in cells @xcite . in the p53-mdm2 system too , as described earlier , there is a similar saturated complex formation , where one component of the complex is subsequently degraded .",
    "this is so similar to the nf-@xmath0b case that it should be possible to construct a model for p53 oscillations which has ordinary differential equations without an explicit time delay ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "because saturated degradation is easily implemented by complex formation we conclude that it would be a very useful general mechanism for producing an effective time delay in cellular systems .",
    "although we have focussed more on how the oscillations are produced , the ` why ' question of whether the oscillations have a direct physiological role in these systems is of course an important one . in nf-@xmath0b , oscillations are observed , not in wild - type cells , but rather in mutants or cells which overexpress certain proteins .",
    "therefore , it is quite possible that oscillations themselves play no direct role in the wild - type response @xcite .",
    "however , wild - type cells do show a complex temporal variation of nf-@xmath0b of which the spiky response of the i@xmath0b@xmath2 module is an extremely important component ( i@xmath0b@xmath100 is the only isoform whose knockout mutants are not viable @xcite ) .",
    "hes1 oscillations , even though damped , might have a direct relevance for spatial pattern formation in embryos .",
    "hes1 is a key element in the notch oscillating cycle , which , in mouse and chicken embryos , is coupled , out of phase , with the wnt cycle . in each period of these cycles ,",
    "a somite is formed , thus leading to vertebrate segmentation .",
    "further work should clarify whether the hes1 oscillations drives these cycles , or is slaved to them , or has a different role entirely . in the case of p53 ,",
    "the oscillations appear to be sustained , therefore it is likely they are directly important for the apoptosis pathway , but again it is not clear precisely how .    even in the absence of unambiguous evidence",
    "that oscillations have a direct functional importance , investigations into the mechanisms underlying the oscillations have implications for some of the ` why ' questions .",
    "for instance , noting that an oscillating signal carries much more information than a steady signal , @xcite suggested that differential regulation of downstream gene circuits could be achieved if they were sensitive to the frequency of the oscillation .",
    "indeed , as we have shown @xcite , it is easy for a single downstream gene to act as a ` low - pass filter ' .",
    "regulatory circuits with multiple genes could be constructed to have particular frequency responses .",
    "however , it is perhaps more fruitful to look for a physiological role in other properties of the dynamics , rather than the periodicity .",
    "one such property , especially prominent in nf-@xmath0b oscillations , is the spikiness .",
    "a spiky signal of this kind carries even more information than a soft oscillation or a steady state level .",
    "spiky pulses , whether periodic or random or isolated , are in a sense less  expensive \" : if a downstream gene is expressed when p53 crosses some threshold it is energetically and metabolically cheaper to have a spike whose peak crosses the threshold for long enough to trigger the gene , than to produce and maintain the protein above that level for a long time .    in this context it is noteworthy that several of the most ubiquitous signalling molecules in eukaryotes , hormones , exhibit recurrent spikes .",
    "the spikes sometime come in a nearly periodic fashion but may also appear more randomly . why hormones appear in spikes",
    "is also not known .",
    "again , we speculate that spikes are an efficient way to trigger other regulatory mechanisms in the body as compared to a steady level which do not deliver ` kicks ' to stimulate other compartments .",
    "an added benefit is that the time between spikes allows an extra level of regulation .",
    "in addition , it might not be good for a biological organism to be subjected to a constant level of hormones all around the clock .    a related issue where spikiness has implications is that of cross - talk between signals .",
    "thus , a high constant level of a protein may potentially interfere with other signals being sent , for instance by saturating common receptors . in contrast , a ` quantization ' of the signal into spikes allows different signals to use common receptors without fear of interference .",
    "an analogy to cars is perhaps useful to visualize this difference : if there were no traffic lights , it would still be easy to drive a car to your destination provided the traffic was not too heavy .",
    "however , if all cars were made 10 times longer it would become much harder to drive at the same density of traffic .",
    "indeed , railway tracks have less intersections because trains are , in effect , very long cars .    on a more concrete level",
    ", our analysis of the nf-@xmath0b network suggests that the spikiness of the oscillations was correlated to a sharp , threshold - like response of the system .",
    "the output ( nuclear nf-@xmath0b concentration ) , we found , could be extremely sensitive to changes in the input ( ikk ) while remaining relatively insensitive to other parameters ; a clear prediction that awaits experimental verification .",
    "such a threshold - like response is likely to be very important for the differential regulation of downstream genes .",
    "it would be very interesting to know if there is a causal connection between spikiness and sharp responses in this system , as well as other regulatory systems .",
    "overall , we conclude that oscillations , especially spiky ones , have many useful properties that could be exploited to improve the speed and efficiency of signalling and response systems .",
