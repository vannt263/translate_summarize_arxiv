    "r. h. dicke in his pioneering work @xcite has shown that a system of @xmath5 number of inverted two - level atoms can spontaneously transit to the ground state during the time inversely proportional to the number of atoms @xmath6 .",
    "because the total energy emitted by the collection of atoms is proportional to @xmath5 , the radiation intensity reveals a square dependence on @xmath5 .",
    "this type of radiation was termed the `` collective spontaneous radiation '' , or the `` dicke superradiance '' .",
    "a remarkable progress has been achieved in the understanding of this phenomenon in  @xcite .",
    "the authors of  @xcite have developed a quantum theory of superradiance for a single - mode model .",
    "the simplicity of the model enables a detailed study of the kinetics and statistical properties of superradiance .",
    "later , it has been found @xcite that the radiation intensity undergoes appreciable statistical fluctuations and the rmsd of the superradiative instability time @xmath7 slowly decreases according to a logarithmic law as the number of particles is increased : @xmath8 .",
    "the elementary unit of the system we have just described is a two - level atom , the concept widely used in quantum electronics and optics to describe physical processes . in the excited state , the two - level atom interacting with the radiation field",
    "is also involved in relaxation processes caused by inter - particle collisions .",
    "if the radiation growth time @xmath7 is much greater than the relaxation time , then the pulse of superradiance is not formed , and the particles emit incoherently .",
    "this greatly restricts the selection of active medium for experimental investigation of superradiance and design of superradiance - based short - pulse electromagnetic sources @xcite .    in this connection ,",
    "a considerable attention has been paid recently to the generation of short superradiance pulses @xcite , also termed as `` self - amplified spontaneous emission '' , `` superradiance '' , or `` cooperative radiation '' @xcite , using short electron beams propagating in complex electrodynamical structures ( undulators , resonators , dielectric and corrugated waveguides , or photonic crystals ) @xcite . in such systems , the average relaxation time that depends on the collisions between charged particles",
    "exceeds manifold the time needed for the formation of the cooperative - radiation pulse .",
    "cooperative radiation is generated via a nonlinear interaction of charged particles and the electromagnetic field , causing the electrons to bunch . as a result ,",
    "the whole of the electron beam becomes spatially modulated .",
    "spatial modulation is accompanied by a coherent emission of electromagnetic waves .    the possibility to produce short pulses of cooperative radiation",
    "was first substantiated in @xcite for free electron lasers ( fels ) . however , the experimentally measured output characteristics of cooperative radiation ( power , radiation spectra , and energy in a pulse ) seemed really stochastic , which , according to theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies , was closely related to the presence of the shot noise inherent in charged - particle beams .",
    "it is noteworthy that high frequency and time stability of the radiation pulse is crucial for many applications .",
    "for this reason , electron beams are premodulated at the radiation frequency to reduce the influence of shot noise on cooperative radiation @xcite .    in a microwave range ,",
    "single - pass crms @xcite and cherenkov generators are more commonly used @xcite .",
    "the generators of cooperative radiation operate in two regimes : traveling wave @xcite and backward wave @xcite .",
    "the distinguishing feature of the traveling - wave regime is that the group velocity of electromagnetic waves and the velocity of charged particles are co - directional .",
    "this regime was applied in first experiments with single - pass crms @xcite and cherenkov generators @xcite . theoretical consideration of radiation gain in short - pulse traveling - wave generators revealed an important peculiarity : the stability of the cooperative radiation parameters can be improved noticeably by injecting into the electrodynamical structure of a beam with a sharp front whose duration is comparable with the emission period @xcite . in this case , the fourier transform of the beam current contains quite a significant spectral component at the radiation frequency . as a result ,",
    "the generation of electromagnetic oscillations starts with coherent spontaneous emission of the whole beam instead of incoherent spontaneous emission from individual particles . as a result",
    ", the degree of fluctuations in cooperative radiation is decreased .",
    "though the early single - pass crms and cherenkov generators operated in the traveling - wave regime , the most impressive results were obtained in experiments with single - pass backward - wave tubes generating cooperative radiation whose peak power was appreciably greater than the beam power @xcite .",
    "for example , the peak radiated power of 1.2 gw was attained at @xmath9 ghz for beam power of 0.87 gw @xcite .",
    "the stability of output parameters of the cooperative - radiation pulse generated in the backward - wave regime , as in a single - pass traveling - wave generator , strongly depended on the beam front .",
    "the analysis of theoretical and experimental works on generation of cooperative radiation reveals that the main cause of statistical spread of the output characteristics is the shot noise inherent in the electron beam .",
    "the impact it produces can be diminished by premodulating the beam at the radiation frequency @xcite .",
    "naturally , one wonders what degree of beam premodulation is required for certain applications .",
    "this problem would be most prevalent for high - current generators with electron beams composed of ectons , individual portions of electrons that contain up to @xmath10 elementary charge carriers @xcite .",
    "taking into account the complex structure of the electron beam is a must for accurate estimations of the shot noise @xcite , which is essential in solving the problem of coherent summation of electromagnetic oscillations from several short - pulse sources of radiation @xcite .",
    "this paper considers the effect of shot noise on the generation of cooperative radiation from a premodulated short beam of particles .",
    "we shall consider this issue by the example of an ensemble of nonisochronous electrons - oscillators interacting with one another via the radiation field , used as one of the basic models for the description of nonlinear generation of electromagnetic waves in crms @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that in the absence of external action , the instability evolves in the ensemble of nonisochronous electrons - oscillators , accompanied at the initial stage by an exponential growth of the radiated power and autophasing of electrons - oscillators .",
    "this exponential growth is then suppressed due to nonlinearity , and the pulse of cooperative radiation is formed @xcite .",
    "the influence of nonisochronism on the peak power of cooperative radiation and the autophasing time of electrons - oscillators was studied in detail by vainstein and colleagues @xcite .",
    "however , the authors of @xcite assumed that the beam had been premodulated at the radiation frequency and left out the effects related to shot noise @xcite .",
    "in our analysis of statistical properties of cooperative radiation , the peak radiated power and autophasing time serve as random variables .",
    "the peak power is the major output characteristic of short - pulse electromagnetic sources , and the autophasing time is the parameter defining the minimum time of particle passage through the generator needed for cooperative instability to evolve .",
    "moreover , the rmsd in the autophasing time is of fundamental importance for coherent summation of oscillations from several cooperative - radiation sources .",
    "the paper s outline is as follows .",
    "first , we derive a system of equations describing the interaction of nonisochronous oscillators via the radiation field by the example of electron ensemble circulating in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "further comes a detailed consideration of statistical fluctuations of cooperative radiation in the presence of shot noise from the ensemble of nonisochronous electrons - oscillators with and without phase premodulation of charged particles .",
    "particular attention is given to finding the autophasing time distribution function .",
    "based on the described study , we shall then investigate in detail the statistical fluctuations in single - pass crms and discuss the limits imposed on the output characteristics thereof by the shot noise and the energy spread .",
    "furthermore , we shall discuss the possibility of coherent summation of oscillations coming from several single - pass sources of cooperative cyclotron radiation .",
    "let us consider the behavior of a nonrelativistic electron beam in a uniform magnetic field  @xmath11 directed along the @xmath12 axis in the presence of the radiative energy loss .",
    "( the behavior of the relativistic electron beam is discussed in appendix a. ) particle velocity components perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic - filed vector are denoted by  @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "then the behavior of particles is described by the equations of motion in the form @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the force acting on the @xmath17th particle from all particles and @xmath18 is its momentum related to the velocity  @xmath19 as @xmath20    if the beam size is less than the radiation wavelength @xmath21 , and the coulomb repulsion force and induction fields can be neglected ( see appendix b ) , then the force acting on each particle is given by the sum ( see appendix c ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the radiation field induced by the @xmath24th particle .",
    "let us pay attention to an essential circumstance @xcite : the expression for @xmath16 is true if the radiative friction force is appreciably less than the lorentz force @xmath25 acting on each particle . otherwise , unphysical self - accelerated solutions may arise .",
    "the requirement that the radiative friction force should be much less than the lorentz force imposes limitation on the magnetic field strength ( in the opposite case the considered theory is invalid ) . for single particle @xcite :",
    "@xmath26 but in the case of a dense beam of coherently emitting particle with @xmath0 electrons , mass @xmath27 , and charge @xmath28 we can write by analogy with   @xmath29 with the present - day acceleration facilities , dense beams with @xmath30 electrons are available ; substitution of @xmath30 into gives @xmath31  kgs .",
    "if this condition is violated , the equation set with the force is inapplicable .    thus , if the radiation reaction force is much less than the lorentz force and the beam size is less than the radiation wavelength , then the equations of motion describing the interaction between charged particles have the form : @xmath32    in the absence of energy losses through emission , the particles are in circular motion with cyclic frequencies @xcite @xmath33 depending on @xmath13 , which is responsible for nonisochronism of oscillations .    using the approximate relation @xmath34 where @xmath35 we shall write vector equations in a component - wise fashion @xmath36 where",
    "@xmath37 then we shall multiply the second equation by @xmath38 and add it to the first one : @xmath39    assuming that all @xmath40 are equal , let us introduce the following notation : @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the average tangential speed of particles ) . then takes the form @xcite @xmath43 the equation set fully describes the behavior of the ensemble of electrons - oscillators moving in a uniform magnetic field in the presence of the radiative energy loss .",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath44 of transverse motion of the oscillators , the radiation power @xmath45 , and the time @xmath46 are related to the dimensionless quantities by @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52    let @xmath53  kgs , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , then @xmath56j , @xmath57  kw , @xmath58  ns , and @xmath59  ghz . in this case , the nonisochronism parameter is @xmath60    let us note that by adding the term of the form @xmath61 to the left - hand side of , we have that under the same initial conditions , all complex amplitudes @xmath62 are multiplied by the additional phase factor @xmath63 having no effect either on the radiation power or on the autophasing time .",
    "this enables analyzing different systems from a common standpoint , and so the equation set describing the behavior of the ensemble of weakly nonlinear electrons - oscillators oscillating in anharmonic potential has the form @xcite : @xmath64 here , the nonisochronism parameter @xmath65 is selected as @xmath66 .",
    "the normalized radiation power and electron energy are given by formulas @xcite @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively . in the absence of the energy spread ,",
    "the absolute values of the amplitudes @xmath69 equal unity at the initial time and the phases @xmath70 are uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath71 .",
    "shot noise in the ensemble of the electrons - oscillators is due to a random distribution of the initial phases @xmath72 .",
    "each set of @xmath72 corresponds to different initial conditions of the equation set .",
    "fluctuations in the initial conditions lead to fluctuations in the output characteristics of cooperative radiation which we study by a numerical experiment .",
    "as follows from , the behavior of the ensemble of nonisochronous oscillators in the absence of the energy spread is determined by two fixed parameters @xmath65 and @xmath0 and a random set of initial phases @xmath72 .",
    "because the distribution of initial phases @xmath72 is random , the numerical experiment with each pair of values of @xmath65 and @xmath0 must have many runs .",
    "this procedure will give information about statistical characteristics of cooperative radiation , the most important of which are peak power @xmath73 , autophasing time @xmath74 , and their relative rmsd  @xmath75 and @xmath1 .",
    "+   +     +   +    in numerical analysis of statistical fluctuations of cooperative radiation in the presence of shot noise , instead of the number @xmath0 of real electrons we took the number @xmath76 of simulated electrons with the charge @xmath77 and initial phases @xmath78 where @xmath79 are random variables uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath80 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that this procedure , boosting the performance of the program , correctly simulates the shot noise in the absence of energy spread .",
    "we selected the following values of controlling parameters : @xmath81 , @xmath82@xmath83 .",
    "the numerical experiment with each @xmath0@xmath65 pair was repeated one hundred times .",
    "1 and 2 show the results of our computation from which we can draw some very important conclusions @xcite .",
    "first , the relative rmsd of the dimensionless peak radiated power weakly dependent on the number of particles @xmath0 ( fig.1 ) decreases as @xmath84 .",
    "second , the autophasing time decreasing as the nonisochronism parameter @xmath65 is increased depends logarithmically on the number of particles @xmath85 .",
    "third , @xmath1 reduces according to the approximate formula @xmath86 , where @xmath87 slowly decreases as @xmath88 varies from 0 to 2 . extrapolating the obtained dependence of @xmath89 and @xmath90 to the region with large number of particles , @xmath91@xmath92 , ( typical number of electrons in single - pass generators ) , we get the estimates @xmath93@xmath94 and @xmath95 . from this",
    "we can deduce that shot noise leads to a @xmath96@xmath97 fluctuation of the autophasing time at insignificant fluctuation of the peak radiated power .",
    "let us note here that phase premodulation of electrons - oscillators : @xmath98 having practically no effect on @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , leads to a noticeable decrease in the fluctuation of autophasing time : @xmath1 no longer decreases logarithmically ( @xmath99 ) , but as @xmath100 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . in the expression",
    ", @xmath101 is the premodulation parameter .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that fluctuations in the cooperative radiation caused by shot noise depend on the degree to which the electrons - oscillators are premodulated .",
    "it has been found , in particular , that premodulation results in that the relative rmsd of the autophasing time @xmath1 becomes square - root dependent on @xmath0 ( @xmath3 ) instead of logarithmically dependent ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "let us show how this important result can be obtained analytically .    according to without premodulation , the contribution coming from each particle to the average oscillation amplitude @xmath102 is @xmath103 .",

    "let us estimate the autophasing time by formula @xmath117 here , @xmath118",
    "@xcite is the time period needed for the radiation power to increase by a factor of @xmath119 in the linear instability stage .",
    "equation implies , first , that the linear stage is much longer than the time during which nonlinear effects are essential , and , second , the radiated power in the saturation stage is @xmath120 .",
    "the latter condition means coherent summation of oscillations from all the particles .    using and",
    ", we can find the distribution function @xmath121 related to @xmath122 by @xmath123 thus we have @xmath124 from the distribution functions @xmath121 plotted in figure [ fig.4 ] follows that with growing premodulation , the autophasing time and its rmsd thereof decrease .",
    "using the distribution function @xmath121 , we shall compute the relative rmsd @xmath1 : @xmath125 here , @xmath126 is the euler constant and @xmath127 is the laguerre polynomial . if @xmath128 , then transforms to the form @xmath129 in the opposite case ( @xmath130 ) , @xmath131 the fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] plots @xmath1 versus @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "it is obvious from [ fig.5 ] that when the number of particles exceeds a certain value depending on the degree of premodulation , the logarithmic @xmath0 dependence of the relative rmsd of the autophasing time @xmath1 ( @xmath99 ) goes to a square - root dependence ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "as follows from , the value of @xmath133 at @xmath134 and @xmath135 agree with the simulated ones ( fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] ) within 20% accuracy .",
    "let us note a very important circumstance .",
    "the duration of the cooperative radiation pulse from nonisochronous electrons - oscillators is @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "the rmsd of the autophasing time in the absence of premodulation has the same order of magnitude : @xmath137 at @xmath128 .",
    "however , phase premodulation of particles leads to an appreciable decrease in the autophasing time spread : @xmath138 at @xmath130 .    in coherent summation of cooperative - radiation pulses ,",
    "the oscillation phases of all single - pass generators must differ by @xmath139 , thus posing the following limitation on the average statistical spread of autophasing time @xmath140 : @xmath141 giving , after the substitution of @xmath142 and @xmath143 @xmath144 let @xmath145 and @xmath146 , then we have the following estimate of the required degree of premodulation : @xmath147 . at @xmath91",
    ", the parameter of premodulation @xmath148 must be greater than @xmath149 .",

    "it should be noted the penman - mcneil algorithm is nt applicable in the presence of energy spread . therefore instead of the number @xmath154 of simulated electrons we took the number @xmath155 of particles with the initial phases uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath71 .    analyzing the results of numerical experiments @xcite",
    ", we can see that the energy spread leads to a sharp drop in the radiated power ( fig .",

    "this is well - illustrated by the fig .",
    "[ fig.7 ] , where the growing influence of the energy spread with higher @xmath65 is seen clearly : the energy spread leads to a stronger suppression of radiation at large @xmath65 , and peak radiated power and radiated energy both decrease . at @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) ,",
    "the maximum attainable radiated power reduces by more than a factor of two .",
    "in this paper we have studied the statistical properties of cooperative radiation from an ensemble of nonisochronous electrons - oscillators interacting with one another via the radiation field .",
    "it has been shown that for the number of electrons @xmath158@xmath92 , typical of modern acceleration facilities , the relative rmsd of the autophasing time from its mean is @xmath159@xmath94 .",
    "the fluctuations of the peak radiated power appear to be negligibly small @xmath95 .",
    "the autophasing time distribution function depending on the number of particles @xmath0 and the degree of premodulation has been obtained in the absence of energy spread .",
    "we used this function to show that when the number of particles exceeds a certain value depending on the degree of premodulation , the logarithmic dependence of the relative rmsd of the autophasing time on the number of electrons - oscillators ( @xmath99 ) goes to a square - root dependence ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that a slight energy spread  ( @xmath160 ) results in a twofold drop of the maximum attainable power of cooperative radiation .",
    "the analysis made here indicates that shot noise , and electron velocity spread pose considerable constraints on the output characteristics of single - pass crms and limits the possibility of coherent summation of cooperative radiation pulses from several sources .",
    "let in laboratory reference there be a relativistic electron beam whose velocity is directed at a small angle to the magnetic - field vector . the particles in the beam move in a spiral under lorentz force @xmath161 .",
    "let us denote the particle velocity components perpendicular and parallel to vector @xmath11 by @xmath162 and @xmath163 , respectively .",

    "<S>  is the critical parameter characterizing the dynamics of electrons - oscillators interacting via the radiation field . </S>",
    "<S> shot - noise related fluctuations of the autophasing time imposes appreciable limitations on the possibility of coherent summation of electromagnetic oscillations from several single - pass crms .    </S>",
    "<S> premodulation of charged particles leads to a considerable narrowing of the autophasing time distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> when the number of particles @xmath0 exceeds a certain value that depends on the degree to which the particles have been premodulated , the relative root - mean - square deviation ( rmsd ) of the autophasing time @xmath1 changes from a logarithmic dependence on @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) to square - root ( @xmath3 ) . as a result , there is an increased probability of coherent summation of electromagnetic oscillations from several single - pass generators .    </S>",
    "<S> a slight energy spread  ( @xmath44% ) results in a twofold drop of the maximum attainable power of cooperative radiation . </S>"
