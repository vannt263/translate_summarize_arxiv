    "segue 3 ( hereafter seg3 ) is a recently discovered milky way satellite , initially estimated to have an extremely low luminosity ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 250 @xmath12 ) , a half - light radius of @xmath11 3 pc , and a distance of @xmath1117 kpc @xcite .",
    "five other milky way satellites are known to have comparably small luminosities and scale sizes : whiting 1 ( @xmath13 ) , pal 1 ( @xmath14 ) , am 4 ( @xmath15 ) , koposov 1 ( @xmath16 ) , and koposov 2 ( @xmath17 ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* edition ) .",
    "all six of these objects are relative outliers in size and luminosity from other known milky way satellites , with luminosities a factor of three lower than those of the other 112 milky way satellites with half - light radii smaller than 5 pc .",
    "these six extreme satellites lie at distances ranging from 17 kpc ( segue 3 , pal 1 ) to 40 kpc or more ( koposov 1 and 2 ) . despite these halo distances ,",
    "one explanation for their anomalously low luminosities is stellar mass loss owing to dynamical evolution , such as tidal stripping or tidal shocking . at their current stellar masses and sizes ,",
    "the evaporation timescales of these clusters are also shorter than the observed ages of the systems ( see e.g. discussion in @xcite ) , suggesting that evaporation is playing a major role in their evolution .",
    "the hypothesis that these satellites are experiencing substantial stellar mass loss is supported by observations : strong evidence for extra - tidal stars has been found in pal 1 , am 4 , and whiting 1 @xcite .",
    "( koposov 1 and 2 havent yet been studied thoroughly enough to confirm or rule out the presence of extra - tidal stars . )",
    "most of these six ultra - low luminosity satellites have been ( at least tentatively ) associated with larger scale stellar streams in the halo . for example , whiting 1 and koposov 1 have been associated with the sgr stream @xcite , am 4 possibly with the sgr stream @xcite , pal 1 possibly with the galactic anticenter stellar structure ( gass ; * ? ? ? * ) or canis major @xcite , and segue 3 possibly with the hercules - aquila cloud @xcite .",
    "perhaps all six of these @xmath18 pc satellites are stripped down versions of more luminous objects , and can provide insight into the evolution of the milky way s satellite population and into the build - up of the halo . because of their small physical sizes and luminosities alone , they have all been classified as globular clusters in the literature .",
    "their central surface brightnesses are higher than those of the known milky way dwarfs , so they are not simply stripped versions of those objects .",
    "although this circumstantial evidence supports a model where these outliers may instead be stripped versions of more luminous globular clusters , no robust classification or detailed kinematic study of these objects has yet been done .",
    "we aim to improve our understanding of these unusual milky way satellites by conducting a detailed kinematic study of segue 3 , the first to be done for any comparable object .",
    "in particular , we study magellan / imacs photometry in @xmath0 and @xmath1 of segue 3 to investigate its structural parameters and star formation history .",
    "we combine this photometry with keck / deimos spectroscopy to obtain a robust member sample .",
    "we use these spectroscopic members to study seg 3 s internal kinematics and to look for evidence of the extra - tidal stars seen in similar clusters .",
    "we use its internal kinematics , improved structural parameters , and star formation history to infer a star cluster classification for seg3 .",
    "we observed segue 3 using magellan / imacs during engineering time on 2010 august 21 with bright conditions and excellent @xmath19 seeing .",
    "we used the imacs in f/4 mode , giving a pixel scale of @xmath20pixel and a @xmath21 field of view .",
    "we obtained a total integration time of 1620s in each of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 sloan filters , using observations which were dithered across the sky .",
    "individual chip images were reduced and stacked to create a weighted mosaic using sextractor , scamp and swarp @xcite , with sdss dr7 providing the astrometric calibration .",
    "normalized flats were used to weight the images , with zero weightings given for known defects .",
    "the stacked mosaics were then photometered using the stand  alone daophot ii / allstar package @xcite .",
    "the photometry was calibrated to sdss by astrometrically matching the stars and then fitting for the difference between instrumental and sdss magnitudes and colors . to robustly determine the calibration parameters",
    ", we used a 1000 iteration bootstrap method which calibrated our detections to sdss sources within our region of interest in the color  magnitude diagram : sources with @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes between 18.0 and 22.5 , and @xmath22 . for each iteration",
    ", we first use an iterative @xmath23 clip to remove outliers and then do an uncertainty weighted fit for the zeropoints and color terms .",
    "we adopt the median values of the bootstrap analysis for the calibration , along with their standard deviations .",
    "the calibration we determine is :    @xmath24    after calibration , we conducted monte carlo tests to assess the completeness of our photometric data .",
    "specifically , completeness limits were calculated by injecting the mosaic image with a @xmath25 grid of artificial stars , spaced 30 pixels apart in @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions plus a small random offset .",
    "we repeated this injection 24 times for a total of 1,500,000 artificial stars in each filter .",
    "for each star , we randomly assign a magnitude between 18 and 25 and subsequently detected the stars using the same criteria as the real data .",
    "we set valid detections as those with a position within 1 pixel of the input position , and measure the fraction recovered as a function of magnitude .",
    "we find the 90% completion limits for our @xmath0 and @xmath1-band data are 23.7 and 23.9 , respectively .",
    "the spectroscopic data were taken with the keck  ii 10-m telescope and the deimos spectrograph @xcite .",
    "to select spectroscopic targets , we used the sdss dr7 photometry , because the imacs photometry discussed in section [ ssec : phot ] was not available at the time .",
    "candidate segue3 member stars were identified by comparison to a padua theoretical isochrone for an age of 13gyr and a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "stars within 0.1mag of this isochrone and brighter than @xmath29 were given the highest priority for spectroscopy ; stars within 0.2mag of the isochrone were given lower priority , all other stars observed were selected in order to fill in the mask .",
    "slitmasks were created using the deimos dsimulator slitmask design software .",
    "two keck / deimos multislit masks were observed on november 16 , 2009 and a third mask on may 16 , 2010 .",
    "the masks were observed for one hour each with the 1200  line  mm@xmath8grating covering a wavelength region @xmath30 .",
    "the spectral dispersion of this setup is @xmath31 , and the resulting spectral resolution , taking into account the anamorphic distortion , is @xmath32 ( fwhm , equivalent to 47 km  s@xmath8  at the ca ii triplet ) .",
    "the spatial scale is @xmath33  per pixel and slitlets were @xmath34 wide .",
    "the minimum slit length was @xmath35 which allows adequate sky subtraction ; the minimum spatial separation between slit ends was @xmath36 ( three pixels ) .",
    "spectra were reduced using a modified version of the spec2d software pipeline ( version  1.1.4 ) developed by the deep2 team at the university of california  berkeley for that survey .",
    "a detailed description of the reductions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the final one - dimensional spectra are rebinned into logarithmic wavelength bins with 15 km  s@xmath8  per pixel .",
    "radial velocities were measured by cross - correlating the observed science spectra with a series of high signal  to  noise stellar templates .",
    "we calculate and apply a telluric correction to each science spectrum by cross  correlating a hot stellar template with the night sky absorption lines following the method in @xcite .",
    "the telluric correction accounts for the velocity error due to mis  centering the star within the @xmath34 slit caused by small mask rotations or astrometric errors .",
    "we apply both a telluric and heliocentric correction to all velocities presented in this paper .",
    "we determine the random component of our velocity errors using a monte carlo bootstrap method .",
    "noise is added to each pixel in the one  dimensional science spectrum , we then recalculate the velocity and telluric correction for 1000 noise realizations .",
    "error bars are defined as the square root of the variance in the recovered mean velocity in the monte carlo simulations . the systematic contribution to the velocity error",
    "was determined by @xcite to be 2.2 km  s@xmath8  based on repeated independent measurements of individual stars .",
    "the systematic error contribution is expected to be constant as the spectrograph setup and velocity cross ",
    "correlation routines are identical .",
    "we add the random and systematic errors in quadrature to arrive at the final velocity error for each science measurement .",
    "radial velocities were successfully measured for 163 of the 205 extracted spectra across .",
    "the fitted velocities were visually inspected to ensure reliability .",
    "our final sample consists of 149 measurements of 132 unique stars , presented in tables [ tab : mem ] and [ tab : nonmem ] . of the 17 stars with repeat measurements , we identify one binary star candidate ( i d 9 , table [ tab : mem ] ) , with velocities which differ by more than @xmath23 between observation epochs .",
    "the remaining stars exhibit velocities consistent within @xmath37 . for our analysis",
    "below , we use a combined velocity for all stars with repeat measurements , but exclude the identified binary when calculating the velocity dispersion of seg3 .",
    "we combine our photometric and spectroscopic data to determine probable members of seg3 . in figure",
    "[ fig : vdist_all ] we present the line  of  sight velocities for our full spectroscopic sample .",
    "we detect a clear overdensity of line  of  sight velocities which begin at the center of seg3 , and continue out to @xmath38 times the half  light radius of the system ( @xmath39 , see section [ ssec : struct ] ) .",
    "these stars exhibit an average systemic velocity of 167 km  s@xmath8 , and are offset by @xmath40 km  s@xmath8  from the center of the milky way distribution at this position .",
    "we hypothesize that stars in our sample within @xmath41 km  s@xmath8  are candidate members of seg3 .",
    "this velocity range is chosen to be wide enough to allow for the inclusion of extra - tidal stars , yet small enough to prevent the inclusion of significant numbers of milky way stars .",
    "we note , however , that our results are not sensitive to small changes in the size of this velocity window .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cmd ] , we present the @xmath1 versus @xmath42 color  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of stars within @xmath43 of the center of seg3 , using our imacs photometry .",
    "also plotted in the cmd are stars that are in our spectroscopic sample but lie at larger radii .",
    "we find a distinct main sequence of stars associated with seg3 , with similar photometric properties as those found by @xcite .",
    "an eyeball fit suggests that this main sequence of stars is well described by an isochrone with an age of 12 gyr and [ fe / h ] @xmath44 @xcite , shifted by a distance modulus of 16.15 . in section [ ssec : isofit ] , we consider the quality of fits for isochrones with different ages , metallicities , and distance moduli . while these may differ from the isochrone used here , we note selection of our member sample will not depend on small deviations in isochrone properties , since we select members using a wide @xmath45 cmd window .",
    "we impose two selection criteria for probable seg3 members .",
    "first , we kinematically select stars that have line  of  sight velocities within @xmath41 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "second , we require seg3 members to pass a photometric cut ( grey area , figure [ fig : cmd ] ) which corresponds approximately to the @xmath46 average photometric uncertainty region around our fiducial isochrone . in total , we select 32 likely members of seg3 and in figure [ fig : spatial ] we present the spatial distribution of the members .      examining our sample of seg3 member stars , we find a number of stars which lie at large distances ( up to @xmath47 ) from the center of seg3 .",
    "we consider the possibility that these stars , and those at smaller radii , might instead be foreground milky way contaminants . to estimate the degree of foreground contamination in our member sample , we utilize the besancon model of the milky way @xcite .",
    "the estimate does not include possible contamination in our seg3 member sample from halo substructures or from unbound stars that are physically associated with seg3 .    for our estimation",
    "we select all besancon stars that are within one degree of the center of seg3 , and are within a @xmath48 average photometric uncertainty region about our fiducial isochrone ( a factor 2 larger than for our seg3 members ) . of these stars",
    ", we find the number of stars that meet our above kinematic criteria is @xmath49% of those that do not . in our spectroscopic sample",
    "we find 11 stars that satisfy cmd criteria but are not within our kinematic window , implying an average of @xmath50 stars are contaminating our sample of seg3 members . from this average",
    ", we quantify the frequency of larger numbers of contaminants using poisson statistics .",
    "we find @xmath51 contaminants occur with a frequency of @xmath52% .",
    "thus , we conclude that the likely number of milky way field halo contaminants is @xmath53 at @xmath54 confidence .",
    "we now use our spectroscopically selected members to derive the age , [ fe / h ] , and distance of seg3 , using a maximum likelihood method which closely follows that described by @xcite . for the procedure ,",
    "a suite of isochrones are fit to a sample of stars , assigning to each a bivariate gaussian probability function whose variance is set by the associated photometric errors .",
    "we apply this analysis using all stars in our photometric data within a radius @xmath55 from the object s center ( @xmath56 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to which we add the 17 spectroscopically confirmed member stars that lie outside that area , resulting in a total sample of 125 stars .    for a given isochrone @xmath57",
    "we compute the likelihood    @xmath58    where    @xmath59\\right)\\nonumber .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for each star @xmath60 , @xmath61 are the magnitude , color , and de - reddened distance modulus values for isochrone @xmath57 that maximize the likelihood of the entire data set @xmath62 in equation [ eqn : eachlike ] .",
    "we take an approximate solution to finding the values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 by searching over a series of fine steps in @xmath65 and @xmath66 values for each isochrone .",
    "input isochrones are supplied by the dartmouth library @xcite , and interpolated so @xmath67 values step by 0.001 mag in the 2d color  magnitude space .",
    "the distance modulus @xmath68 is sampled over a range of @xmath69 in steps of 0.01 mag .",
    "we calculate the maximum likelihood values @xmath70 over a grid of isochrones , covering an age range from 8 to 14gyr and metallicity range @xmath71 [ fe / h ] @xmath72dex .",
    "grid steps are 0.5 gyr in age , and 0.1 dex in [ fe / h ] . with a grid of @xmath70 values",
    ", we can locate the most likely value and compute confidence intervals by interpolating between grid points .",
    "in addition to this interpolation , we smooth the likelihood values over @xmath73 grid points in order to provide a more conservative estimate of parameter uncertainties . in figure [ fig : isolike ] , we present the relative density of likelihood values for the sample described above .",
    "we find the isochrone with the highest probability has an age of 12.0 gyr and [ fe / h ] @xmath74 , with 68% and 95% confidence contours presented in the figure .",
    "the marginalized uncertainties about this most probable location correspond to an age of @xmath5gyr , a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath75dex , and a distance modulus of @xmath76mag ( @xmath77 kpc ) .",
    "we assume a distance of 17 kpc in the calculation of physical size and absolute magnitude in section 4.2 .",
    "to assess how much the inclusion of the 17 spectroscopic members outside of @xmath55 has influenced the above results , we repeat the above computation using only the 32 spectroscopic members found above .",
    "we find parameters derived for this subsample are consistent with the larger sample but have larger uncertainties , with age @xmath78gyr , [ fe / h ] @xmath79dex , and @xmath80mag ( @xmath81 kpc ) .",
    "we present a new determination of the structural parameters of seg3 , using the photometry presented in section [ ssec : phot ] . for our analysis",
    "we follow the maximum likelihood method of @xcite , as described in @xcite .",
    "this method starts by assuming an analytic surface density profile , and then fits the profile parameters using all stars meeting cmd criteria , thus avoiding the need to bin or smooth data .",
    "we fit structural parameters for seg3 using two choices of density profiles commonly used to describe the light distribution in ultra - faint systems , an exponential and a plummer @xcite profile . in both cases ,",
    "the parameters we calculate are the scale length of the system , the coordinates of its center , its ellipticity , position angle and the foreground / background stellar density . to estimate parameter uncertainties , we carry out a bootstrap analysis using @xmath82 realizations of the photometric data .",
    "before proceeding with our analysis of the structure of seg3 , we must carefully consider which photometric data to use .",
    "we note in section [ ssec : phot ] that the 90% completeness limit of our data is at a magnitude of @xmath83 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters .",
    "however , due to the increased contamination of unresolved galaxies beyond a magnitude of @xmath84 , we conservatively limit our structural analysis to stars brighter than @xmath85 . in table",
    "[ tab : struct ] we present the results for both plummer and exponential density profiles .",
    "we find structural parameters very similar to those of @xcite , with most results within @xmath86 of values previously reported .",
    "a notable exception , however , is our determination of the half ",
    "light radius of @xmath87 and @xmath2 , or @xmath88 pc and @xmath3 pc for an exponential and plummer profile , respectively . while within @xmath89 from the value of @xcite , these are @xmath90 smaller than previously found .",
    "we attribute such discrepancies to our higher quality photometric data , and to the different analysis techniques used here . in figure",
    "[ fig : struct ] we present the 1d surface density profile and 2d surface brightness contours for seg3 .",
    "both the plummer and exponential profiles are found to provide good fits to the data , while two  dimensional contours reveal a circularly symmetric profile , with little evidence for strong tidal distortion .",
    "in addition to structural properties , we estimate the absolute magnitude of seg3 following the method described in @xcite .",
    "previous estimates of the absolute magnitude by @xcite reported a value of @xmath91 for seg3 .",
    "such a low magnitude makes traditional methods for calculating total luminosities , such as adding individual stellar fluxes , too sensitive to the inclusion ( or exclusion ) of potential members ( outliers ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to alleviate issues related to low number statistics , the method used here relies solely on the total number of stars that belong to the satellite and not on their individual magnitudes .    in short",
    ", our method estimates the absolute magnitude by integrating a theoretical luminosity function , using the above structural analysis . following the results of section [ ssec : isofit ]",
    ", we use a luminosity function for a @xmath92gyr stellar population with a [ fe / h]@xmath44 from @xcite , assuming a salpeter imf .",
    "we then integrate this luminosity function down to the magnitude limit of @xmath93 , and scale the results to match the number of stars found by our structural analysis .",
    "our final estimate of the absolute magnitude , therefore , is the integral of this scaled luminosity function , integrated down to the limiting mass of the salpeter imf ( @xmath94 ) . like our structural parameters , the uncertainty of the absolute magnitude",
    "is estimated by bootstrapping the data @xmath82 times .",
    "this method yields @xmath95 or @xmath96l@xmath97 for an exponential profile .",
    "if we use a plummer profile instead , we obtain @xmath98 which translates into @xmath99l@xmath97 .",
    "while the uncertainties are significant , these values make segue 3 the lowest luminosity stellar system known to date .",
    "this tiny luminosity combined with the small size of seg3 yields a brighter central surface brightness ( @xmath100 for an exponential profile , @xmath101 for a plummer profile ) than that of the most diffuse milky way companions .",
    "we note , in fact , that our values for the luminosity and surface brightness of seg3 may be overestimated if stars fainter than the magnitude limit of our observations have be preferentially lost due to relaxation ( see section [ sec : dynamical ] ) . while it is unclear whether relaxation is significant in seg3 , such an effect would result in only a small change in our estimates , since low mass stars do not contribute much to the total luminosity . for the remainder of the analysis presented here",
    ", we adopt the structural parameters and absolute magnitude obtained from using a plummer profile above .",
    "we assess the nature of segue 3 through several independent lines of evidence .",
    "first , in section [ ssec : vdist ] we examine the velocity distribution of seg3 spectroscopic members . in section [ ssec :",
    "agemetal ] , we consider possible spreads in the distribution of ages and metallicities of seg3 spectroscopic member stars .",
    "finally , in section [ ssec : size ] we examine the size and luminosity of seg3 relative to other known milky way satellites . as discussed below",
    ", we conclude that all three indictors agree with our null hypothesis : segue 3 is an old , extremely low luminosity star cluster in the halo of the milky way .",
    "we present in figure [ fig : vdist ] the distribution of velocities for seg3 spectroscopic members .",
    "we find the majority of the members ( 66% ) lie at small projected radii ( @xmath102 ) , with the remainder up to 14 half ",
    "light radii from the center of seg3 .",
    "we consider these eleven spatially outlying stars stars , as well as other lines of evidence , as possible signs of stellar mass loss in seg3 ( discussed below in section [ sec : dynamical ] ) .    to obtain a reasonable estimate of the velocity dispersion ( and hence dynamical mass ) of seg3",
    ", we choose to focus on the velocity measurements within @xmath103 only , and exclude the binary star identified by repeat velocity measurements ( i d 9 , table [ tab : mem ] ) .",
    "this choice excludes distant candidate member stars potentially unbound to seg3 , and reduces the amount of foreground contamination , since foreground stars are more likely at larger radii . in estimating the velocity dispersion",
    ", we use the maximum likelihood technique described by @xcite .",
    "if we naively include all 20 stars within @xmath103 , we infer a velocity dispersion of @xmath104 km  s@xmath8  for seg3 .",
    "however , this relatively large dispersion is primarily driven by the presence of a single outlying star ( i d 20 , table [ tab : mem ] ) , with a measured velocity of @xmath105 km  s@xmath8 , @xmath45 away from the systemic velocity of seg3 . omitting this star ,",
    "our estimate of the velocity dispersion plummets to @xmath7 km  s@xmath8 , a value consistent with zero .",
    "inclusion of the outlying star has a profound consequence on the nature of seg3 .",
    "if included , we must necessarily infer the presence of significant amounts of dark matter in seg3 , since the velocity dispersion would imply a mass  to  light ratio of @xmath106 within @xmath56 .. ] if omitted , the velocity distribution allows very small values of the dispersion , giving dynamical masses consistent with stellar material alone .",
    "we must , therefore , carefully consider whether to omit the outlying star .",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to test the hypothesis that the outlying star is revealing the true velocity dispersion , rather than being a genuine outlier from the velocity distribution .",
    "first , we assume a value for the true , intrinsic velocity dispersion of seg3 ranging from 0 to 10 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "we then repeatedly generate a sample of 20 stars with velocities drawn randomly from a gaussian corresponding to the intrinsic dispersion , convolved with our deimos measurement uncertainties . of these samples , we take those which have a dispersion between @xmath104 km  s@xmath8  and ask how frequently the dispersion is reduced to below @xmath107 km  s@xmath8 , once we omit the largest outlier .",
    "our simulations indicate the highest frequency occurs at an intrinsic dispersion of 5.8 km  s@xmath8 , at a rate of 3.8% .",
    "therefore , at @xmath108 confidence , our simulations indicate the outlying star within @xmath103 is not due to low  number statistics , but is instead a genuine outlier from the distribution . with this conclusion ,",
    "we assume it is reasonable to omit the outlying star , and infer a velocity dispersion of @xmath7 km  s@xmath8  within @xmath103 . by adopting such a velocity dispersion",
    ", we can infer a mass  to  light ratio of @xmath109 within @xmath56 .",
    "while inconclusive , from this mass  to  light ratio alone there is no compelling evidence for significant dark matter content in segue 3 .",
    "properties of the stellar populations of milky way satellites have proven to be a useful indicator for the presence of an underlying dark matter halo . in short ,",
    "the deeper potential well provided by non - baryonic material enables star formation processes to withstand feedback effects from ( e.g. , ) supernovae , facilitating more extended episodes of star formation .",
    "this effect manifests itself in the presence of a range of metallicities amongst stars , since metals from earlier generations of stars may be incorporated into subsequent ones .",
    "faint satellites have demonstrated this phenomenon , showing internal [ fe / h ] spreads up to 0.5 dex or more @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cmd_agemetal ] , we present the effect of varying the age and metallicity of isochrones from our fiducial values of 12 gyr and [ fe / h ] @xmath44 . in the right panel , we see that the members of seg3 are consistent with a spread in [ fe / h ] @xmath110 dex , within the photometric errors",
    ". such dispersions in [ fe / h ] are smaller than values typically found in ultra",
    " faint systems @xcite , indicating the stellar population of seg3 may be quite different from dark matter dominated satellites .",
    "in addition to internal spreads in metallicity , the average value of [ fe / h ] in stars can also be used to test whether seg3 may contain significant dark matter .",
    "@xcite show a strong correlation between the total luminosity and [ fe / h ] for milky way dwarf galaxies , such that the faintest satellites are the most metal poor . extrapolating the relation from @xcite ,",
    "we find seg3 , with a absolute magnitude of @xmath111 , should exhibit a mean [ fe / h ] @xmath112 , far lower than the @xmath6dex we observe . for comparison",
    ", segue 1 ( @xmath113 ) has a value of [ fe / h ] @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "for this to be a meaningful comparison , we assume that seg3 would not have undergone massive stellar loss if it contains significant dark matter .",
    "the low spread and ( relatively ) high mean of [ fe / h ] values inferred from isochrone comparisons indicates that the metallicity characteristics of seg3 are distinct from that of dark matter dominated ultra  faint satellites . while enticing , several caveats exist .",
    "first , our sample of seg3 members is small , totaling 32 stars .",
    "more extensive samples might show larger scatter than seen here .",
    "in addition , significant uncertainties exist in the values of theoretical isochrones , especially under the correlated effects of varying age and [ fe / h ] values .",
    "we have only explored one such set of isochrones here @xcite .",
    "to avoid such uncertainties , a definitive measurement of the metallicity would require spectroscopic measurements of [ fe / h ] values .",
    "for our current data , this would require a calibration of the relationship between [ fe / h ] and the ca ii triplet for main sequence stars .",
    "since no such relation exists , we do not attempt to relate the values of the ca ii triplet in our spectra to [ fe / h ] .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the scatter in ca ii equivalent width is consistent with no abundance spread .",
    "a final diagnostic tool for discriminating star clusters from satellites with dark matter halos is the relationship between size and luminosity of milky way objects . in figure",
    "[ fig : size ] , we show the sizes and luminosities of milky way halo objects ( distances @xmath115 kpc ) . of these systems",
    "we consider two classes , stellar systems with dark matter ( dwarf spheriodal , ultra ",
    "faint dwarf galaxies ) and those without dark matter ( e.g. , globular clusters ) . a clear trend is present between the two : at fixed luminosity , objects with dark matter are consistently larger in size , often by up to an order of magnitude , than objects classified as star clusters . segue 3 s size and luminosity are far smaller than those of objects known to be dominated by dark matter .",
    "this difference provides additional circumstantial evidence that seg3 is a star cluster .",
    "such a conclusion is further supported by theoretical arguments , which expect low mass dwarf galaxies to be significantly larger in size ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than seg3 .    under the three lines of evidence presented in this section , we conclude that segue 3 is likely a star cluster with little to no dark matter content",
    "this hypothesis is further supported by tentative signs for stellar mass loss ( see below ) , which has also been seen in the majority of small and faint stellar clusters .",
    "discussed in section [ ssec : vdist ] , the distribution of velocities within @xmath103 of the center of segue 3 imply a velocity dispersion of @xmath7 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "the distribution of these velocities are consistent with being drawn from a gaussian distribution , suggesting that seg3 is bound within @xmath103 .",
    "although its not possible to draw a robust conclusion about the extended stellar distribution of this extremely low luminosity system , if we consider seg3 members across all radii , then we find tentative evidence for mass loss in seg3 .",
    "the fact that 1/3 of our candidate member stars lie outside of three half - light radii hints that there may be an excess of seg3 member stars at large distances , as expected if it is currently undergoing stellar mass - loss .",
    "we attempted to quantify this excess ( or lack thereof ) by correcting the surface density profile of spectroscopic members for target efficiency and comparing with expectations from a pure plummer model .",
    "however , uncertainty owing to small number statistics in both our characterization of target efficiency ( as a function of position ) , and in our predicted number of stars at large radii , was too great to make a meaningful comparison with observations .    of the thirteen stars at radii @xmath116 , four ( ids 20 , 22 , 27 , and 31 in table [ tab : mem ] ) lie at velocities more than 10 km  s@xmath8  away from the systemic velocity of @xmath117 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "three of the four stars have velocities which are each @xmath118 km  s@xmath8  below the systemic velocity of seg3 , while the fourth has a velocity @xmath119 km  s@xmath8  above the systemic . in a sample of 32 stars , the likelihood of finding four such stars in a tidally isolated system is small .",
    "performing similar monte carlo tests as in section [ ssec : vdist ] , we determine these outlying stars are not due to small sample size at @xmath120 confidence",
    ". these stars may be stars lost by seg3 and heated up by a dynamical interaction , or they may be contaminants from the field halo or from the possible proximity of seg3 to to another known halo overdensity ( see section [ ssec : hercaq ] ) .",
    "however , simple estimates presented in sections [ ssec_contam ] and [ ssec : hercaq ] indicate the chance of all four stars being contaminants is excluded at @xmath120 confidence .",
    "while such simple estimates may underestimate the degree of contamination of our member sample , mass loss in seg3 is nevertheless supported from dynamical arguments .",
    "first , we consider the possibility of tidal stripping in seg3 by estimating the jacobi radius @xmath121 of the system . since @xmath122",
    ", we conservatively overestimate @xmath121 by assuming a milky way circular velocity of only 180 km  s@xmath8at the galactocentric distance of seg3 ( 10 kpc ) .",
    "this yields a value of @xmath123 pc , @xmath124 times the half ",
    "light radius of seg3 .",
    "given that seg3 is likely not on a purely circular orbit , and may be associated with a local overdensity ( see below ) , the true tidal radius of seg3 is likely smaller still .",
    "thus , from these simple estimates , it seems highly likely that seg3 is undergoing some sort of tidal stripping .",
    "in addition to tidal stripping , we consider potential evidence for relaxation in seg3 , using the half ",
    "mass relaxation time @xmath125 @xcite . using our measurements of the structural properties of seg3 and assuming a coulomb logarithm of @xmath126",
    ", we estimate @xmath127 myr .",
    "the timescale for total disruption of a cluster through relaxation is of order @xmath128 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying an evaporation time of @xmath129 gyr for seg3 .",
    "such evaporation times are short relative to the estimated age of the stellar population ( 12 gyr ) , indicating seg3 must have experienced significant mass loss in order to have survived to present day .",
    "definitive support for relaxation can be obtained if signs of mass segregation are found in the system .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to see any clear signs of mass segregation , due to the small size and mass range ( @xmath130 ) of our member sample .",
    "interestingly , the mass loss implied by the small tidal radius and small relaxation time of seg3 are similar to that found in other faint stellar systems @xcite . for instance , @xcite estimate koposov 1 and 2 have @xmath125 @xmath11 70 and 55 myr , and @xmath131 11 and 9 pc , respectively .",
    "these facts , and the tentative associations to large  scale galactic structures ( see below ) , may indicate a common evolutionary history for these systems .",
    "segue 3 lies at a distance of @xmath132  kpc from the sun , at a location of @xmath133 = @xmath134 .",
    "this is coincident in projection with the recently discovered hercules",
    " aquila cloud @xcite .",
    "early discovery data ( sdss dr5 ) presented by @xcite indicated the cloud is located at @xmath135 , and extends galactic latitudes as low as @xmath136 at @xmath137 .",
    "arguments for the spatial overlap of seg3 and extended halo substructure have been strengthened by the analysis of segue / dr7 sdss data by @xcite .",
    "subtracting off a smooth model for the stellar distribution , @xcite find a number of new halo overdensities .",
    "of these , one lies at @xmath138 , in excellent agreement with the location of seg3 . while coincident with the hercules - aquila cloud in projection , the distance to stars in this newly identified halo structure ( and in seg3 ) are closer than the @xmath139 20 kpc distances of the herc - aquila debris in that direction .",
    "it is presently unclear whether or not these structures all have a common origin .",
    "although seg3 appears to be coincident with a spatially extended @xcite halo overdensity , this halo overdensity is nt necessarily kinematically associated with seg3 .",
    "there is a dearth of ( non - member ) stars with velocities @xmath140 km  s@xmath8  from the systemic velocity of seg3 , suggesting that this structure may not be kinematically associated with seg3 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : vdist_all ] , we find a significant number of stars with large negative velocities , more than 40 km  s@xmath8  lower than the systemic velocity of seg3 .",
    "these stars are not associated with any other known mw structure , and may be attributed to the @xcite @xmath141 overdensity .",
    "it is unlikely that these stars are instead hercules - aquila stars , because their color - magnitude distribution is consistent with a more nearby stellar population than the herc - aquila cloud in this direction .",
    "if we assume the stars in this kinematic halo structure are normally distributed , we find their distribution has mean of @xmath142 km  s@xmath8  and fwhm of 48 km  s@xmath8 . under this assumption",
    ", we would expect to find an average of @xmath143 stars that meet our velocity criterion for membership in seg3 ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : members ] ) .",
    "accounting for poisson variance , therefore , we expect this low velocity population of stars ( @xmath144 km  s@xmath8 ) may be contaminating our seg3 member sample by at most one star ( 99% cl ) .",
    "thus , given our contamination estimates for both the mw foreground and for this additional kinematic halo population , we can rule out contamination from these source as the origin for _ all _ four outliers in section [ sec : dynamical ] at @xmath120 confidence .    other faint stellar systems ( like koposov 1 ) have also been linked to large streams and structures @xcite .",
    "because of the two distinct halo kinematic populations in our data , it is unclear whether seg3 is associated with the @xcite @xmath141 overdensity .",
    "it seems likely that seg3 is kinematically offset from this overdensity .",
    "a more extensive photometric - kinematic study of the halo debris in this region of sky might be able to reach a more robust conclusion about the association , or lack thereof , of seg3 and other halo structures .",
    "we have investigated the nature of the faint milky way satellite segue 3 using new keck / deimos spectrocopic and magellan / imacs photometric data . using the data we have identified a sample of 32 probable member stars for seg3 , one of which is definitively identified as a binary system through repeated velocity measurements .",
    "we summarize our conclusions as follows :    * new imacs photometry reveals a distinct main sequence of stars in the cmd of seg3 , with the majority of these stars lying within two half  light radii of the center . using maximum likelihood methods which fit isochrones from @xcite",
    ", we infer an average age of @xmath5gyr and an average [ fe / h ] of @xmath6 for the stellar population . *",
    "we analyze the structural properties of seg3 , using plummer and exponential profiles .",
    "we find structural parameters similar to those of @xcite , except for the half - light radius which we find to be smaller by @xmath145 .",
    "using a salpeter imf and cmd properties from our photometry , we find seg3 has an absolute magnitude of @xmath146 , making it the faintest stellar system known to date .",
    "* examining 20 spectroscopic member stars within three half  light radii , we find a kinematically bound group of 19 member stars and identify one star which is an outlier of the velocity distribution ( at 95% confidence ) .",
    "for this group of bound stars we infer a velocity dispersion of @xmath7 km  s@xmath8 , consistent with very low values for the true velocity dispersion .",
    "* segue 3 is likely a faint stellar cluster with no significant dark matter content .",
    "this is evidenced by our measurement of the velocity dispersion within three half  light radii , the ( relatively ) high average and low scatter in [ fe / h ] values implied by isochrones , and small physical size of seg3 relative to similar luminosity ultra  faint dwarf galaxies .",
    "* we find signs of possible mass loss in segue 3 , indicated by eleven candidate member stars outside of @xmath103 .",
    "while these stars may originate from the milky way or nearby substructure , we estimate a jacobi radius of @xmath147 and a half  mass relaxation time of @xmath148 myr for seg3 , suggesting mass loss should be important . * seg3 appears spatially coincident with an extended overdensity discovered by @xcite , which may be associated with the hercules  aquila cloud .",
    "however , we find it is kinematically offset from the structure ; evidenced by the low density of non - member stars within @xmath140 km  s@xmath8  from the systemic velocity of seg3 . in our spectroscopic sample",
    "we identify a collection of stars with line  of  sight velocities @xmath149 km  s@xmath8 , which may be associated with the structure .",
    "we find at most one star from this population may be misidentified as a member .",
