    "power diagrams were introduced by aurenhammer in @xcite , as a generalization of the more commonly known voronoi diagrams .",
    "they recently surfaced in algebraic geometry , as the spines of amoebas , see @xcite .",
    "another appearance of the power diagram is what other authors call a tropical hypersurface , see @xcite .",
    "they also appear when string theorists use toric geometry , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the treatment they receive in @xcite is different from the one in @xcite .",
    "the essential tool that passare and rullgrd use is the legendre transform , a tool that first seems to have been introduced in convex analysis in @xcite .",
    "the essential tool that aurenhammer uses is that the power diagram of some points in @xmath0 is a projection of a convex hull in @xmath1 .",
    "we spell out the relation between the classical theory of voronoi diagrams and that of the tropical hypersurface .",
    "note that what we call here a delaunay triangulation is called a coherent triangulation in chapter 7 of @xcite .",
    "such triangulations are called regular in @xcite .    after that we will explore the relationship between voronoi diagrams and power diagrams . in particular given a power diagram @xmath2 of @xmath3 points @xmath4 in @xmath0 we will construct a voronoi diagram @xmath5 of @xmath3 points in @xmath1 a hyperplane section of which is the diagram @xmath2 .",
    "thus power diagrams are affine voronoi diagrams in a very precise sense",
    ".    then we focus on higher order structures . with a voronoi diagram there come the @xmath6-th order voronoi diagrams and the delaunay triangulation .",
    "the @xmath6-th order power diagram is again a power diagram , see @xcite , and to it there is associated the @xmath6-th order coherent triangulation .",
    "the union of all the power diagrams is a hyperplane arrangement .",
    "we conclude that not every picture that looks like a power diagram is actually a power diagram .",
    "the main new point of view we present in this article is the relation between tropical hypersurfaces and discrete morse theory introduced by forman in @xcite .",
    "this seems to have gone unnoticed before .",
    "the triangulations are polyhedral complexes , and the affine linear functions that define the power diagram give rise to discrete morse function on the dual simplicial complex .",
    "we apply this third way of looking at power diagrams to a notion we introduced before , the morse poset .",
    "morse posets are seen to be determining a discrete vectorfield .",
    "we apply our newly found knowledge to the problem of enumerating different morse posets .    in the final section",
    "we show another application of tropical geometry to computational geometry .",
    "we use maslov dequantization to determine the medial axis .",
    "many of our results can in some explicit form or another be found in the literature .",
    "we have gone to great lengths to include appropriate references , but in all likelihood we are not complete .",
    "it has been remarked by other authors also that many results in tropical geometry - as the field has come to be known - are just well - known theorems from other fields , but now in a different guise .",
    "this article just reinforces that opinion .",
    "in this section we show the equivalence of two definitions of the power diagram .",
    "first we discuss the original notion of aurenhammer , then we show that these are equivalent to the definitions of passare _ et . al._.      the original definition of a power diagram is by means of distance function with weights .",
    "take a point set @xmath7 . throughout this article",
    "we assume that @xmath8 .",
    "assign a weight @xmath9 to each point @xmath10 . then write down the functions :",
    "@xmath11 here we have used the following notation : @xmath12    for a subset @xmath13 the set @xmath14 is the closure of @xmath15 the sets @xmath16 are sometimes called cells .",
    "the _ separator _ @xmath17 between @xmath10 and @xmath18 is the hyperplane . @xmath19",
    "it is no restriction to assume that @xmath20 .",
    "we may add some number to all of the functions @xmath21 : the cells will not change .",
    "in fact we can add any function @xmath22 to the @xmath21 .",
    "we will get the same power diagram .",
    "power diagrams are polyhedral subdivisions .",
    "we repeat definition 1 in @xcite .    a _ polyhedral subdivision _",
    "@xmath2 of a polyhedron @xmath23 is a subdivision of @xmath24 in polyhedra @xmath25 , such that    * the union of all sets @xmath26 is @xmath24 . * if @xmath25 and @xmath27 are both in @xmath2 then so is their intersection .",
    "* every compact subset @xmath28 of @xmath24 intersects only a finite number of the @xmath25 .",
    "the sets @xmath14 for @xmath13 are a polyhedral subdivision of @xmath0 . this polyhedral subdivision is called the _ power diagram_.    the cells cover @xmath0 .",
    "they are the intersection of a finite number of halfspaces of the form : @xmath29 .",
    "so they are polyhedra .    besides many similarities , there are a few crucial differences between power diagrams and voronoi diagrams . in a power diagram",
    "the cell of a point may well be empty .",
    "it might happen that @xmath30 , for all @xmath31 and all @xmath32 .    also ,",
    "whereas in voronoi diagrams , @xmath10 is always contained in its own cell , in a power diagram the cell of @xmath10 might not be empty and still @xmath10 does not lie in its own cell !    the power diagram can be constructed much like the voronoi diagram . recall that the voronoi diagram is the upper convex hull to the tangent planes to a parabola @xmath33 .",
    "for the case of the power diagrams we do much the same thing .",
    "look at figure [ fig:12 ] .",
    "we take cylinders with radius @xmath34 around the lines @xmath35 in @xmath1 .",
    "the intersection of the cylinders with the parabola is a torsion zero space curve .",
    "we draw the planes in which they lie ( left figure ) and we consider the upper convex hull of these planes ( right figure ) .",
    "the projection of its singular sides is the power diagram .",
    "the above construction is also described in @xcite , section 4.1 .",
    "when the @xmath36 the construction reduces to the well - known construction of voronoi diagrams . in that case",
    ", of course , one has to take the tangent planes to the paraboloid .",
    "the power diagram can be defined using only affine functions .",
    "with amoebas in mind , this was done in @xcite . with tropical hypersurfaces in mind ,",
    "this was done in @xcite .",
    "the separator between @xmath10 and @xmath18 is a hyperplane .",
    "it is given by @xmath37 we can define the power diagram solely using the affine functions @xmath38 , where the coefficient @xmath39 is @xmath40 consider the function @xmath41 the following proposition shows that we can define the power diagram solely using affine functions .",
    "for a subset @xmath13 the set @xmath14 is the closure of @xmath42    in @xcite , @xmath43 is defined as the minimum of the functions @xmath44 .",
    "taking the minimum or taking the maximum is just a convention though .",
    "the affine definition of power diagrams is more elegant .",
    "we lose the immediate appeal of the construction in figure [ fig:12 ] , but two statements are now immediately clear .",
    "the intersection of a hyperplane with a power diagram is again a power diagram .",
    "the image of a power diagram under an affine map @xmath45 is again a power diagram .",
    "so a power diagram can be sliced , after which we obtain a new power diagram .",
    "in fact , every power diagram in @xmath0 is a slice of a voronoi diagram in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a power diagram in @xmath0 .",
    "there is a voronoi diagram @xmath5 in @xmath1 and a hyperplane @xmath46 such that @xmath47 .",
    "we will explicitly construct such an @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath4 be the set of points in @xmath0 that determine @xmath2 .",
    "write @xmath48 we have @xmath49 so when @xmath50 we get @xmath51 now let the power diagram be given by functions @xmath21 as in equation .",
    "it is no restriction to assume that @xmath52 , because only the differences @xmath53 matter for the power diagram .",
    "thus we can choose @xmath54 .",
    "dual to the voronoi diagram is the delaunay triangulation . in a similar way",
    "there exists a dual of the power diagram .",
    "this dual cell complex is not always a triangulation , similar to the case with the delaunay triangulation .",
    "if we use the tropical point of view ( with affine functions ) we can best explain the dual object using the legendre transform , see @xcite , which we explain below .",
    "this dual object is also considered in @xcite , where it has the name coherent triangulation .",
    "we start with some definitions .",

    "not every polyhedral subdivision is regular , see chapter 5 in @xcite , or chapter 7 in @xcite .",

    "theorem 2.2.7 of @xcite reads :    [ sec : legendre - transform ] let @xmath70 be the maximum of a number of lower semi - continuous convex function .",
    "then @xmath43 is also a lower semi - continuous convex function .",
    "furthermore @xmath63 is the infimum over all finite sums : @xmath71    with theorem [ sec : legendre - transform ] we calculate the legendre transform of the function that determines the power diagram .",

    "we have @xmath74 where the infimum is taken over all @xmath75 such that @xmath76 it is no restriction to assume that only @xmath77 of the @xmath75 are non - zero because any point in the convex hull of the @xmath10 can be expressed as a sum of @xmath78 of the @xmath10 .",
    "the infima are best thought of in a geometric way .",
    "take the convex hull @xmath79 .",
    "the lower faces form the graph of @xmath63 over the convex hull @xmath80 .",
    "we summarize our discussion in a theorem .",

    "what exactly happens here can best understood by writing out the equations . in figure [ fig:12 ]",
    "the graph of @xmath83 is drawn .",
    "then the cylinders in the picture are @xmath84 . or @xmath85 .",
    "hence the three planes of which we determine the upper hull are @xmath86 the triangle in figure [ fig:11 ] is the plane @xmath87 where the @xmath75 are defined by @xmath88 . in the point @xmath10",
    "we have that the graph of @xmath89 lies @xmath90 above the paraboloid @xmath83 , whilst the graph of @xmath91 lies @xmath90 below the paraboloid there .",
    "theorem [ thm : legendre - transform ] gives a dual triangulation of the power diagram .",
    "given a power diagram @xmath2 specified by @xmath3 affine functions , the coherent triangulation @xmath92 is the set of points @xmath93 where @xmath63 is not differentiable .    since the coherent triangulation is the projection of the lower convex hull , it has also the structure of a polyhedral complex . in the case",
    "when all the weights @xmath9 are zero this coherent triangulation is of course the delaunay triangulation .",
    "a number of points in @xmath4 in @xmath0 is affinely in general position when the convex hull of each subset of length @xmath94 of @xmath4 is full dimensional . for voronoi diagrams",

    "the following theorem is left to the reader .",
    "the coherent triangulation is a simplicial complex when the power diagram is in general position .",
    "consider the function @xmath101 this function hides the _",
    "gateau differential_. namely , let @xmath102 be a function . if the limit @xmath103 exists , it is called the gateau differential . see @xcite , theorem 2.1.22 . for a convex set @xmath23",
    "the _ supporting function _ of @xmath24 is the function @xmath104 theorem 2.2.11 . in @xcite",
    "says that the gateau differential @xmath105 is the supporting function of @xmath106 let us see an example of what that means .",
    "take @xmath64 to be one of the points of @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath107 .",

    "it is stated in that article that @xmath111 is the convex hull of the gradients of the functions @xmath44 for which @xmath112 .",
    "that last statement and the theorem 2.1.22 are all equivalent to what is neatly formulated in proposition 1 of @xcite :    there is a subdivision of the convex hull @xmath80 , dual to the power diagram @xmath2 .",
    "the cell @xmath113 dual to @xmath114 is @xmath115 reversely @xmath116    similar statements are in the review by pennaneach , see @xcite .",
    "however pennaneach does not discuss the relation between the figures [ fig:12 ] and [ fig:11 ] .",
    "also she does not make clear what the relationship between this theorem and the well - known theory of voronoi diagrams/ delaunay tesselations is . her review however is heartily recommended .",
    "we have noted before that faces in the power diagram might disappear .",
    "this will happen for some @xmath117 iff.@xmath118 cells in the power diagram correspond to vertices in the coherent triangulation . in that case",
    "it is very easy to see which vertices disappear .",
    "they are the ones lying in the epigraph of the legendre transform .",
    "remember that the epigraph of a function @xmath119 is defined as : @xmath120 let us sum up some consequences :    if @xmath18 lies outside the convex hull of @xmath121 then the cell @xmath122 is not empty .",
    "proof : the lifted point @xmath123 forcibly is part of the lower hull of the points @xmath81 .    the transition on the power diagrams where a cell disappears is exemplified in figure [ fig:9 ] . in the pictures",
    "the convex hull of the points @xmath124 is drawn .",
    "the graph of the legendre transform @xmath63 is formed by the lower faces of that polytope . in the ground plane",
    "we see the projection of those lower faces : the coherent triangulation dual to the power diagram . in the ground plane also",
    "the circles with radius @xmath34 are drawn .",
    "on the left hand side of figure [ fig:9 ] we see a point with a small circle around it .",
    "this point disappears when we make one of the circles in the pictures ( the one on the upper right ) bigger .",
    "such has been done on the left hand side of figure [ eq:9 ] .",
    "the upper right circle is much bigger there and the lifted point corresponding to the small circle lies inside the epigraph of the legendre transform @xmath63 .",
    "we thus see that there are three sorts of events on planar coherent triangulations :    * convex hull events and edge flips * disappearing vertices .",
    "convex hull events and edge flips already occur in families of voronoi diagrams .",
    "a detailed study of these phenomena can be found in @xcite .",
    "however in a dual triangulation of a voronoi diagram , none of the cells @xmath125 can be empty .",
    "given a power diagram we define a @xmath6th order power diagram .",

    "if @xmath126 is the index set of the @xmath6 biggest of the @xmath138 then @xmath139 is the biggest of the numbers @xmath140    there are two sources of cells in @xmath141 .",
    "* let @xmath142 and @xmath143 be two power cells in the @xmath6-th order power diagram .",
    "assume that the two cells are adjacent , that is there is an edge between the two vertices in the dual coherent triangulation @xmath134 .",
    "this means that @xmath144 has @xmath145 distinct elements .",
    "thus the cell of @xmath144 in @xmath141 is not empty .",
    "* let the cell of @xmath146 be an empty cell .",
    "that is : @xmath147 but that at some point @xmath148 there is only one @xmath149 for which @xmath150 is bigger than all @xmath151 for @xmath152 .",
    "the union of the power diagrams of order @xmath6 is a hyperplane arrangement .",
    "the hyperplanes are the separators .",
    "each such separator is equipped with a polyhedral subdivision , that is : the separator between @xmath10 and @xmath18 is a hyperplane @xmath153 divided in at most @xmath3 closed convex subsets @xmath154 .",
    "if @xmath108 lies in the interior of @xmath154 then @xmath108 lies on the @xmath155-th order power diagram .    that there is a polyhedral subdivision on the separator is rather obvious .",
    "the points of the @xmath6-th diagram is the intersection of two closed convex subsets , so its intersection is also convex .",
    "the aforementioned hyperplane arrangement is not a generic arrangement .",
    "generically , at most @xmath156 hyperplanes intersect . in this case , @xmath94 hyperplanes intersect when they correspond to some cell in a higher order diagram .",
    "a hyperplane arrangement does not determine in general a power diagram .",
    "drawings that look like a power diagram need not be one , just as not all triangulations are coherent . for examples of the latter phenomenon",
    "see for instance section 5.1 in @xcite , where coherent triangulations are called _",
