    "we are closing in on neutron stars both observationally and theoretically .",
    "observationally more and better masses and radii are determined by a number of different methods .",
    "the  large \" masses implied in few cases ( as in the vela x-1 pulsar where a mass of @xmath2 has been suggested ; @xcite ) poses a real challenge to models of neutron stars built using the so - called modern equation of state ( eos ) where the uncertainties are reduced by improved two- and three - body forces , relativistic effects and many - body calculations @xcite .",
    "even the stiffest eos so far developed seem to be facing difficulty in accounting for the extreme values ( up to @xmath3 ; sect .",
    "4 ) . in @xcite ,",
    "hereafter ob , as an alternative , we constructed an eos of dense matter based on the skyrme model for strong interactions which represents baryons as solitons of classic pionic fields .",
    "the resulting compact objects we named _ skyrmion stars _ ( sss ) @xcite are intrinsically heavier ( due to the stiffness of the skyrmion fluid ; hereafter sf ) than any other type of compact stars computed using modern eos .",
    "sss can be as massive as @xmath4 leading us to speculate ( given the above mentioned observations ) that these might exist in nature .",
    "we expect only older sss that have accreted enough mass to reach these extreme masses . ] .",
    "the paper is presented as follows : sect .",
    "2 is devoted to the discussion of the skyrme model and its link to quantum - chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the problem of the _ missing attraction _ in the skyrme model is described . in sect .",
    "3 , we discuss the role the dilaton ( the glueball potential in qcd ) could play in curing such a problem by binding skyrmions together to form the sf .",
    "we end sect . 3 by reminding the reader of the basic properties of the sf and the resulting eos used to construct models of sss .",
    "the astrophysical implications follow in sect . 4 where we compare sss to stars constructed using modern eos of dense matter .",
    "we conclude in sect .",
    "we first give a brief overview of the skyrme model .",
    "the fundamental principles are discussed at a basic level .",
    "the interested reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite for a thorough introduction to the topic .",
    "skyrme constructed a model of pion interactions consisting of a conventional model of weak meson interactions plus an additional ( higher - order ) term thought to take into account indirect effects of heavier mesons like the @xmath5-meson .",
    "the now well - known skyrme lagrangian density is usually written as @xcite , @xmath6 where , @xmath7 is the skyrme term ( @xmath8 is the chiral field and @xmath9 is interpreted as the pion decay constant ) , and @xmath10 [ u^{+}\\partial^{\\mu}u , u^{+}\\partial^{\\nu}u ] ) \\label{three}\\ ] ] is the quadratic term introduced by skyrme to keep the skyrmion stable against the derrick instability @xcite ( @xmath11 is the skyrme parameter ) .",
    "skyrme found that his model contained ` topologically nontrivial ' configurations ( extended objects ) of the meson fields , namely topological solitons , which he identified as baryons . for twenty years",
    "the skyrme model was overshadowed by the tremendous success of qcd and only in the early 1980 s after the establishment of its link to low energy qcd that the model was revived .",
    "the success of qcd is limited to the high energy regime , while at low energy it remains virtually intractable .",
    "the reason for this is that qcd has a running coupling constant @xmath12 ; it is a function of momentum transfer , or distance . at short distances of the order of 0.1 fm or less ( high energy and momentum transfer of several gev ) qcd",
    "is characterized by a small enough @xmath12 that it is treated perturbatively .",
    "all of the results obtained in this regime are consistent with experimental data .",
    "this is the phase in which the relevant degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons and it is called the asymptotic freedom phase . at large distances of the order of 1 fm or more ( low energy and momentum transfer of 1 gev or less ) @xmath12 is of the order of unity and qcd is a nonperturbative theory .",
    "this is the confinement phase in which quarks are confined inside hadrons and the hadronic degrees of freedom are more relevant .",
    "this phase , which is the most practical , is the most mathematically complex .",
    "it should provide all properties of hadrons such as masses , sizes , magnetic moments , lifetimes , scattering properties and , in principle , all nuclear phenomena .",
    "the first major step to overcome this problem was taken by @xmath13thooft @xcite .",
    "he found that in the limit of a large number of colors ( large @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 could be used as an expansion parameter . in this limit",
    ", qcd simplifies a great deal and @xmath13thooft went on to show that at large @xmath14 , qcd is equivalent to a local field theory of mesons and ` glueballs ' ( bound states of gluons , without quarks ) , with an effective interaction between them of order @xmath15 .",
    "the second step was taken by witten @xcite .",
    "assuming confinement , he showed that baryons in large @xmath14 qcd behave much like solitons in a weakly coupled local field theory of mesons . in this limit ,",
    "baryon masses scale as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the strength of the meson coupling , while baryon sizes are of order 1 .",
    "solitons in weakly coupled theories have masses that scale as @xmath18 and sizes that tend to constants as @xmath17 tends to zero .",
    "even though the mesons are weakly interacting , the solitons interact strongly as do baryons in qcd .",
    "the next natural step , it seems , is to derive the effective meson lagrangian from the fundamental qcd lagrangian .",
    "this task , as it turned out , is immensely difficult .",
    "its achievement is equivalent to the solution of the intractable original problem of low energy nonperturbative qcd in the confinement phase .",
    "nevertheless , the form of the resulting effective lagrangian is being narrowed down under reasonable assumptions .",
    "assuming chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in qcd ( with the physical pions as the resulting goldstone bosons , and taking the low energy limit in which one expects the golstone bosons to dominate the dynamics ) it has been shown that the first term in the resulting low energy effective lagrangian is @xcite : @xmath19 which is astonishingly similar to the skyrme term ( eq .  [ two ] ) ! this picture , which emerged from large-@xmath20 qcd , is precisely what skyrme had in mind long before qcd .",
    "further work showed that the similarities between the skyrme model and to what is described as the nature of mesons and baryons in large @xmath21 qcd is simply intriguing .",
    "the skyrme model , however , as it is build was known to predict an isospin independent spin - orbit force with the _ wrong _ sign .",
    "that is , it predicts a _ repulsive _ interaction .",
    "the product ansatz for the two - baryon system as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ( eq .  [ two ] ) , beyond its relative simplicity as compared to other two - baryon field configurations which can be found in the literature @xcite , becomes exact for large @xmath22 separation .",
    "unfortunately , it is not the case for the isoscalar component of the spin - orbit force since the standard skyrme model predicts an isospin independent spin - orbit force with the _ wrong _ sign .",
    "namely , it predicts a _ repulsive _ interaction while the phenomenological bonn potential @xcite as the paris potential @xcite gives an _ attractive _ one .",
    "this came to be known as the problem of the _ missing attraction_. extensions of the skyrme model consisted on including higher - order terms in powers of the derivatives of the pion field @xcite .",
    "expressed in terms of an @xmath23 matrix @xmath8 which , as we have said characterizes the pion field , a six - order term corresponding to @xmath24-meson exchange @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the baryon current , @xmath27 the @xmath24-meson mass and @xmath28 a dimensionless parameter related to the @xmath29 width , might be a good candidate to solve the problem of the @xmath22 isoscalar spin - orbit force . while it was believed that the inclusion of such a term leads to the correct sign ( _ attractive _ interaction ) for the isoscalar spin - orbit potential @xcite , recent calculations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for e.g. ) proved that by taking into account the second part of of the sixth - order term the anomaly of the skyrme model ( _ repulsive _ force instead of _ attractive _ ) remains .",
    "the treatment of the spin - orbit part of the two - pion exchange potential within the skyrme model needed to be improved in order to correct the anomaly of that sign .",
    "below we explain how and why the dilaton field was suggested as a plausible cure .",
    "in ref . @xcite and @xcite the authors explored the idea of coupling the skyrmion to the dilaton field .",
    "this idea to _ account for a scalar field _",
    "confines the skyrmion and provides the attractive term missing in the original skyrme formalism ( see ob for more on this ) .",
    "we start by writing the energy of @xmath30 skyrmions per unit volume ( parameterized by the density , @xmath31 ) at finite temperature . in the mean field approximation",
    "it is given by ( where we adopt natural units with @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the strength of the coupling of the @xmath35-meson ( of mass @xmath36 ; @xmath37 is the mean - field value ) to skyrmions while @xmath38 represents the isospin degrees of freedom ( @xmath39 for neutron matter and @xmath40 for symmetric nuclear matter ) ) , the @xmath5 meson coupling has been omitted which reduces the analysis to symmetric nuclear matter only . as such in ob the isospin degrees of freedom ( @xmath41 ) was taken as a free parameter as to allow for the two regimes  pure neutron matter and symmetric matter  to be explored . ] .",
    "@xmath42 is the contribution to energy of a single skyrmion while @xmath43 is the skyrmion s momentum . @xmath44 and @xmath45 parameterize the single particle and anti - particle distribution functions .",
    "the pressure of such an ensemble at @xmath46 is then simply given by @xmath47 .",
    "one finds that the contribution of the vector meson field ( @xmath35 ) to the pressure grows with density ( @xmath48 ) , and is positive ; the dilaton potential @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 is the mean - field value ) gives a negative contribution to the pressure , acting to bind the system into a fluid ; the sf .",
    "once the eos describing such a fluid is derived ( ob ) the corresponding compact objects ( sss ) are then computed @xcite .",
    "sss in our picture are not boson / soliton stars where the soliton is a global structure over the scale of the star but rather form their constituent baryons as topological solitons using pions fields .",
    "this is fundamentally different from other ",
    "exotic \" stars which also follow from solutions to an effective non - linear field theory of strong forces ( see also @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) . in what follows , we conclude this letter by describing astrophysical cases plausibly supporting the existence of sss in nature .",
    "in fig .  [ fig.1 ] we compare the @xmath51 relation for skyrmion stars ( ob ) to the theoretical @xmath51 curve obtained using six recent realistic models for the eos ( uu , bbb1 , bbb2 , bpal12 , hyp , and k@xmath52 ) . the solid curves labeled ss1 and ss2 are for strange stars ( the data was kindly provided to us by the authors of ref .",
    "the triangle depicts the mass - radius constraint from fits to x - ray bursts in 4u 1636 - 53 . inside the triangle",
    "is the allowed range of @xmath53 and @xmath54 which satisfies the compactness constraints as modeled in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see their figure 4 ) , and clearly favoring stiffer eoss .",
    "our modeled stars ( ob ) cross the triangle suggestive of 4u 1636 - 53 as a plausible ss candidate .",
    "_ qpos _ are neutron stars emitting x - rays at frequencies of the orbiting accreting matter",
    ". such _ quasi - periodic oscillations _ ( qpo ) have been found in 12 binaries of neutron stars with low mass companions .",
    "if the qpo originate from the innermost stable orbit @xcite ) of the accreting matter , their observed values imply that the accreting neutron star has a mass of @xmath55 in the case of 4u 1820 - 30 ; this would rule out most modern eoss allowing only the stiffest ones .",
    "sss is one possibility given that the gravitational mass of the maximum stable non - rotating ss has a value of @xmath4 ( ob ) . for completeness",
    ", one should note that even by making the modern / recent eos stiffer at high densities in a smooth way , the maximum mass can never exceed @xmath56 due to the causality condition @xcite .",
    "we gave a brief historical overview of the skyrme model , its predictions of hadronic interactions and its interesting connection to qcd .",
    "here we showed how the repulsive term in the skyrme model can be removed by coupling the skyrmion to the dilaton field .",
    "this lead to the concept of the skyrmion fluid and the related hypothetical stars we called skyrmion stars .",
    "the stiffness of the skyrmion fluid allows for sss to be as massive as @xmath57 .",
    "the sss show unique features ; for a given mass their radii are in general larger than those of neutron stars constructed using modern eoss .",
    "we discussed examples in astrophysics where sss might constitute plausible candidates .",
    "future observations constraining the mass - radius plane of compact stars would most likely prove or rule out the existence of sss in nature .",
