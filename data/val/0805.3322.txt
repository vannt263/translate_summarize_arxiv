    "complex systems can be represented as networks , where the main units of the system become nodes and interacting units are connected by edges .",
    "the last years have witnessed an intense research activity on networks by the scientific community , after the discovery that many systems in nature , society and technology , turn into graphs with peculiar properties  @xcite .",
    "in particular , many networks are characterized by a heterogeneous distribution of the number of neighbors of a node , or degree , where nodes with low degree coexist with nodes with large degree ( hubs ) .",
    "such heterogeneity is responsible for a number of remarkable features of real networks , such as resilience to random failures / attacks  @xcite , and the absence of a threshold for percolation  @xcite and epidemic spreading  @xcite .",
    "the presence of nodes with different degrees means that there is a broad diversification of their roles within the graph .",
    "centrality measures are designed to rank graph nodes based on their topological importance  @xcite . among the most popular centrality measures we mention",
    "degree itself , but also measures depending on shortest paths between nodes pairs , like node betweenness and closeness .",
    "there are as well centrality measures that depend on spectral properties of graph matrices .",
    "these measures are important because they are usually associated to simple dynamic processes taking place on graphs , like diffusion .",
    "in particular , the pagerank algorithm , proposed by the google founders brin and page  @xcite , managed to turn google into the leading interface between users and the world wide web . in recent work spectral properties of graph matrices have also been used to characterize the participation of nodes in network subgraphs ( subgraph centrality )  @xcite and to estimate the bipartitivity of graphs  @xcite .",
    "however , spectral centrality measures have not been much investigated in the physics literature .",
    "we shall introduce and review four centrality measures : pagerank , eigenvector centrality  @xcite and the hub / authority scores introduced by kleinberg for his hits algorithm  @xcite .",
    "these measures are usually adopted on directed graphs , we shall as well discuss extensions to the undirected case , where applicable .",
    "in section  [ sec1 ] we present the measures and describe them in some detail .",
    "analytical and numerical results on particular graphs will be shown in section  [ sec2 ] , whereas in section  [ sec3 ] we shall compare the rankings of nodes of real graphs for different centrality measures .",
    "conclusions will be reported in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "the basic matrix of a graph is the _ adjacency matrix _ @xmath0 , where the element @xmath1 equals @xmath2 , if nodes @xmath3 and @xmath4 are connected by a link , @xmath5 if they are not .",
    "if the network is directed , the adjacency matrix is not symmetric . in this case",
    ", it is necessary to distinguish between two types of links adjacent to a node , i. e. links pointing to the node ( incoming ) and links pointing outside ( outgoing ) .",
    "therefore , there are two types of degree : _ indegree _ , i.e. the number of incoming links ; _ outdegree _ , i.e. the number of outgoing links .",
    "likewise , one distinguishes between the _ in - neighbors _ of a node , i.e. the nodes pointing at the node , and the _ out - neighbors _ , i.e. the nodes pointed at by the node .",
    "the directedness of the links has a number of important implications , involving both some basic structural concepts , like connectivity , and processes taking place on the network .",
    "for instance , a random walk is a stationary process on any undirected graph , but it is not in general on a directed graph , due to the possible presence of _ dangling ends _ , i.e. nodes with zero outdegree , that act as sinks for the process . on the other hand",
    ", diffusion leads to a natural definition of centrality , based on the frequency that a walker stops by a node during the process . in order to make a diffusive process stationary on a directed graph , one needs to give the walker the opportunity to leave from a dangling end .",
    "pagerank offers a simple solution , which we describe below .",
    "pagerank ( pr ) is the prestige measure used by google to rank web pages .",
    "it is supposed to simulate the behavior of a user browsing the web .",
    "most of the times , the user visits pages just by surfing , i.e. by clicking on hyperlinks of the page he is on ; otherwise , the user will jump to another page by typing its url on the browser , or going to a bookmark , etc .. on a graph , this process can be modelled by a simple combination of a random walk with occasional jumps towards randomly selected nodes .",
    "this can be described by the simple set of implicit relations @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the number of nodes of the graph , @xmath8 is the pr - value of node @xmath3 , @xmath9 the outdegree of node @xmath4 and the sum runs over the nodes pointing towards @xmath3 .",
    "the _ damping factor _",
    "@xmath10 is a probability , that weighs the mixture between random walk and random jump . on practical applications",
    "it is usually set to small values ( typically 0.15 ) . for any @xmath11",
    "the process reaches stationarity , as a walker has a finite ( no matter how small ) probability to escape from a dangling end , whenever it lands there . when @xmath12 , the process may not be stationary and pr is ill defined .",
    "when @xmath13 , instead , the jumping process dominates and all nodes have the same pr - value @xmath14 .",
    "pr goes beyond indegree : in order to have a large pr - value for a node it is important to have many neighbors pointing at a node , i.e. large indegree , but it is also important that the neighbors have large pr - values .",
    "so , if two nodes have equal indegree , the node with more `` important '' neighbors will have larger pr .",
    "solving the set of equations ( [ eq1 ] ) is equivalent to solving the eigenvalue problem for the transition matrix @xmath15 , whose element @xmath16 is given by the following expression : @xmath17 pr is just the principal eigenvector of @xmath15 , and is usually determined with the power method , i.e. by repeatedly multiplying the matrix @xmath15 by an arbitrary vector until all the entries of the resulting vector are stable .",
    "this is also the procedure we adopted to compute the eigenvectors corresponding to all centrality measures we studied .",
    "the literature on pr is very large , because of its huge impact on web search . in one of the first theoretical studies",
    "@xcite , the dependence of pr on the damping factor was investigated . in general , the attention has been mostly focused on the graph of the world wide web , where web pages are nodes and the hyperlinks their connections .",
    "comparatively little has been done to study the measure on more general classes of networks .",
    "a recent mean field study  @xcite has shown that the average pr value of nodes with the same indegree is a linear function of indegree in the absence of degree - degree correlations . in another study ,",
    "some analytical results were found on pr distributions on special classes of graphs  @xcite . in section  [ subsec3.1 ]",
    "we shall briefly resume the results of  @xcite and build up on them .",
    "the eigenvector centrality ( ev ) is also based on the principle that the importance of a node depends on the importance of its neighbors . in this case",
    "the relationship is more straightforward than for pr : the prestige @xmath18 of node @xmath3 is just proportional to the sum of the prestiges of the neighboring nodes pointing to it @xmath19 from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) we see that @xmath18 is just the @xmath3-component of the eigenvector of the transpose of the adjacency matrix with eigenvalue @xmath20 .",
    "we notice that the trivial eigenvector with all components equal to zero is always a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the true ev is then associated to the existence of non - trivial solutions of the eigenvalue problem of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) we see that nodes with indegree zero also have zero centrality : in general , nodes pointed at by nodes with zero centrality also have zero centrality and this effect will propagate to other nodes , so that in many cases ev would not give any information about a big number of nodes . to avoid this , it is useful to make the following modification : to each node we assign a prestige @xmath21 , which is independent of its relationships with the other nodes .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) is then modified as follows : @xmath22 the role of the parameter @xmath21 reminds that of the damping factor @xmath10 in pr .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 weighs the relative importance of the contribution of the peers versus that of the node itself . the new measure is called _ @xmath23-centrality _ ( @xmath23ev )  @xcite and is the one we shall investigate in this paper .",
    "we remark that , in contrast to pr , here the solutions do not have a natural interpretation in terms of probability , so the sum of the @xmath23-centralities need not be @xmath2 .",
    "however we shall normalize the final values by dividing them by their sum , so to make them add up to @xmath2 , for practical purposes .",
    "google s pr was not the first prestige measure for web pages based on the web s graph representation . shortly before the seminal paper by brin and page , jon kleinberg",
    "@xcite had proposed another solution to the problem of ranking web sites based on their importance for the users .",
    "this solution was the _ hits algorithm _ , which distinguishes two types of web pages : _ hubs _ and _ authorities_. let us suppose that a user submits a query through a search engine . if a page is very relevant for this query , one can reasonably expect that it will be pointed at by many other pages .",
    "however , the simple indegree would not allow to discriminate the relevant pages from other pages with similar ( large ) indegree .",
    "an important difference is that pages pointing to a relevant page are likely to point as well to other relevant pages , so to create a sort of bipartite structure where relevant pages ( authorities ) are cited by special pages / indices ( hubs ) .",
    "such bipartite structures allow to identify the relevant pages for the user query .",
    "therefore one assigns two scores to a page @xmath3 of the web : the _ hub score _ @xmath18 and the _ authority score _ @xmath24 .",
    "pages with high authority scores are pointed at by pages with high hub scores . in turn , a good hub points at ( very ) authoritative pages .",
    "this mutually reinforcing mechanism is described by the coupled relations @xmath25 which can be rewritten in the form of simple eigenvalue equations for both @xmath26 and @xmath27 by substitution @xmath28 @xmath29 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) and  ( [ eq8 ] ) we see that the hub and authority scores are just eigenvectors of the matrices @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we stress that both @xmath30 and @xmath31 are symmetric , whether @xmath0 is symmetric or not .",
    "the scores @xmath26 and @xmath27 correspond to the principal eigenvectors of these matrices .",
    "in  @xcite the two main limits of the pr measure , corresponding to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , were investigated .",
    "analytical results can be derived for special graphs , such as graphs grown with popular mechanisms , like preferential attachment  @xcite . for our proofs",
    "we shall focus on the model by dorogovtsev , mendes and samukhin ( dms )  @xcite , which generates graphs with power - law degree distributions with any exponent larger than @xmath34 . in this model , at each time step a new node is added to the graph and @xmath35 links are set from the new node to preexisting ones .",
    "the probability that a new node @xmath3 gets attached to a node @xmath4 ( with indegree @xmath36 ) is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a positive constant .",
    "when @xmath39 one recovers the recipe of the original preferential attachment formulation of barabsi and albert  @xcite . in general , the exponent of the indegree distribution @xmath40 .",
    "for simplicity , we shall study the special case in which @xmath41 , i.e. each node has outdegree @xmath2 and the network is a tree .",
    "the results are however independent of @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 is very small . to the first order in @xmath10 , and remembering that each node has outdegree @xmath2 by construction , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) takes the following form @xmath42 which looks particularly simple , though not generally solvable . from eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) we see that the pr of a node equals a constant plus the pr of its in - neighbors .",
    "this recipe enables to calculate pr recursively on simple trees , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where we focus on a subgraph of a tree .",
    "subgraph of a tree .",
    "the pr - values of all nodes shown can be simply calculated.,width=188 ]    node @xmath0 is the root of the subgraph as every walk starting on any of the nodes will reach @xmath0 at some stage .",
    "we call any node with this property a _ predecessor _ of @xmath0 . the pr value of any node of the graph is determined only by its predecessors",
    ". in the case illustrated , the calculation is particularly simple : we start from the leaves of the subgraph ( empty circles ) whose pr is just @xmath43 because they have no incoming links , and move towards @xmath0 . for each node",
    ", we apply the relation ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "the final values are reported next to the nodes . from this example",
    "we can deduce a number of general properties :    * all pr values are multiples of the elementary unit @xmath43 ; * pr increases if one moves from a node to another by following a link ; * the pr of each node @xmath3 , in units of @xmath43 , equals the number of its predecessors .",
    "since pr takes only discrete values , in the following we shall measure it in units of @xmath43 .",
    "we thus indicate the distribution with @xmath44 , with @xmath45 .    in a dynamic process like network growth ,",
    "it is crucial to see what happens to the pr values / distribution when a new node comes into the picture .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where a new node @xmath46 is added to the network of fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we see that only the nodes encountered along the path from @xmath46 to @xmath0 , including @xmath0 , are affected , while the others retain their pr values .",
    "in particular the presence of the node @xmath46 determines an increase by @xmath43 in the pr values of the affected nodes .",
    "if a new node n gets attached to any node of the subgraph , it adds an equal contribution @xmath43 to the pr of all nodes in a path from @xmath46 to the root.,width=283 ]    now we are ready to build a master equation for the pr distribution @xmath44 on a dms graph . at time @xmath7 , the graph has @xmath7 nodes and @xmath47 links ( the root does not generate links ) ; the pr distribution is @xmath48 . if we add node @xmath49 we get a new distribution @xmath50 . as we have seen above",
    ", the new node will contribute an additional @xmath43 to the pr of the nodes in the path from @xmath49 to the root of the graph .",
    "we need to compute the balance between the nodes passing from pr @xmath51 to @xmath52 and those passing from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "the probability @xmath54 that the pr of node @xmath3 , initially equal to @xmath52 , will be changed by the new node equals the probability that the link set by the new node gets attached to one of the predecessors of @xmath3 ( including @xmath3 ) and equals @xmath55 where @xmath56 means that @xmath4 is a predecessor of @xmath3 .",
    "none of the predecessors of @xmath3 , other than @xmath3 can reach pr @xmath53 because of the new node , as their initial values are necessarily smaller than @xmath52 .",
    "the number of predecessors of @xmath3 ( including @xmath3 ) is @xmath52 and the total number of adjacent links to the predecessors is @xmath51 ( one for each predecessor , except @xmath3 ) .",
    "so , @xmath57 the number of nodes with pr @xmath52 that are affected by the presence of the new node and its link is then @xmath58 and the master equation reads @xmath59 eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) holds for @xmath60 . for @xmath61",
    "a modification is necessary , as there can not be nodes with zero pr , so the term @xmath62 is not defined .",
    "however , since the new node has no incoming links , the number of nodes with pr @xmath2 increases by @xmath2 because of the new node , so we can write @xmath63 the stationarity condition of eqs .",

    "[ fig3 ] ) , which also show that the hypothesis of the tree is not necessary , as long as each node has the same outdegree @xmath35 .    in  @xcite the same result was found for other models of network growth , like barabsi - albert preferential attachment  @xcite and the copying model  @xcite .",
    "pr distribution for small @xmath10 on a dms graph with @xmath67 nodes , @xmath41 and @xmath68 . in this case",
    "the indegree distribution is a power law with exponent @xmath69.,width=302 ]    it is possible that this property holds for general graphs where the flows converge towards a central root ( sink )",
    ". indeed , our finding agrees with the more general result on the size distribution of supercritical trees  @xcite .",
    "moreover , numerical studies have shown that the same behavior holds for the graph of internet , when one considers the distribution of the size of the basin connected to a given point  @xcite .",
    "indeed , our calculation follows the same procedure usually adopted for the calculation of the area of basins in river networks .      the case @xmath13 is well defined , but trivial , as all nodes end up having the same pr - value @xmath14 .",
    "we ask how this limit is reached . if @xmath70 , the contribution to pr given by the in - neighbors of a node is very small compared to the constant term , which is close to @xmath14 . in order to study the behavior of this term",
    ", we define the _ reduced pagerank _",
    "@xmath71 of a node @xmath3 as @xmath72 we assume that all nodes have the same outdegree @xmath35 . in this case , to leading order in the infinitesimal @xmath73 eq .  ( [ eq1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the indegree of @xmath3 .",
    "we conclude that on any graph , the reduced pr of a node in the limit @xmath33 is proportional to the indegree of the node , if all nodes have the same outdegree .",
    "this result has been derived independently in  @xcite . as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) , the distribution of the reduced pr for @xmath33 has the same trend as that of indegree , which can be easily verified numerically ( fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "reduced pr distribution for @xmath70 on a dms graph with @xmath67 nodes , @xmath41 and @xmath68 .",
    "the curve matches the indegree distribution.,width=302 ]      pr can be easily extended to undirected graphs as well .",
    "the corresponding equation reads @xmath76 where now @xmath36 is the degree of node @xmath4 . for the purposes of a random walk ,",
    "undirected links can be crossed in both directions , so a pure random walk now always reaches stationarity due to the absence of dangling ends .",
    "in fact , the stationary probability of a random walk on a node of any undirected graph is simply proportional to the degree of the node  @xcite .",
    "however , in eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) we have still the contribution of random jumping , and it turns out that the mixed process is still hard to solve .",
    "we are not aware of a general solution in this case . in the limit",
    "@xmath32 pr is now well behaved , and its distribution coincides with the degree distribution of the graph . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the distributions of reduced pr for different values of @xmath10 on a dms graph with a power law degree distribution and exponent @xmath69 .",
    "the reduced pr expresses the contribution to pr given by the random walk .",
    "we see that the curves follow the decay of the degree distribution for any value of @xmath10 . we have computed the reduced pr distribution on many other graphs and in all cases we found that they follow the same trend as the degree distribution .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig5a ] we show the comparison between reduced pr and degree for a sample of the web link graph . here",
    "the nodes are web pages of the domain .gov and two pages are connected if there is a hyperlink from one to the other .",
    "there are @xmath77 nodes and @xmath78 links .",
    "the graph is directed but pr was calculated by neglecting the directedness of the links . as we can see , the decay of the distributions of reduced pr resembles that of the degree distribution .",
    "the graph at hand is not simple like the dms networks , as it presents a large number of loops and community structure .",
    "therefore the result is likely to be general .",
    "we can show this with a simple argument .",
    "the general equation for reduced pr on undirected graphs is :    @xmath79    that we can solve formally by successive iteration , obtaining the general form @xmath80 where @xmath81 indicates the neighbors of the @xmath82-shell of the node @xmath3 ; so , @xmath83 indicates the nearest neighbors of @xmath3 , @xmath84 the next - to - nearest neighbors , and so on . the last sum in the first line of eq .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) is , for a given node @xmath85 , a sum over its neighbors @xmath81 .",
    "this sum , that we call @xmath86 , contains @xmath87 terms , @xmath87 being the degree of node @xmath81 .",
    "the sum @xmath86 can be approximated as the product @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the expected value of the average of @xmath90 over the neighbors of a node of the network . in general , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is a random variable with mean zero . in this way , it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) that , for any value of @xmath82 , the product of sums reduces to @xmath93 plus the sum of many random variables like @xmath92 . due to the central limit theorem , the latter sum , if it includes a large number of terms , yields a very small value with large probability .",
    "we can then conclude that , for @xmath94 sufficiently large , each term of the series in eq .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) is proportional to @xmath94 with good approximation , therefore @xmath71 is also proportional to @xmath94 , for any value of the damping factor @xmath10 .",

    "centrality measures are very important to understand the properties of the nodes of complex networks and their topological roles .",
    "we have studied the most important centrality measures based on properties of graph matrices : pagerank , eigenvector centrality , and the hub and authority scores of hits .",
    "all these measures deduce the importance of a node in a self - consistent way from the importance of its nearest neighbors and , in the case of the hits scores , of its next - to - nearest neighbors .",
    "we have resumed some recent results on pagerank distributions on particular types of tree - like graphs . on those graphs",
    ", the distribution of pagerank in the limit @xmath32 decays as a power law with exponent @xmath34 .",
    "the same is true for @xmath23-centrality , because its defining equation is formally equivalent to the equation for pagerank in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "these results on centrality distributions are likely to be true for an extended class of graphs , where there is a flow from the outermost nodes ( leaves ) to a sink .",
    "we have also seen that , on any graph , in the limit @xmath33 , the reduced pagerank of a node , i.e. the contribution of the random walk process to the measure , is simply proportional to the indegree of the node , if the nodes have ( about ) the same outdegree .",
    "we have studied for the first time the extension of pagerank to the case of undirected networks , finding that the reduced pagerank of a node is proportional to its degree , for large degrees , for any graph and value of @xmath10 .",
    "we proposed a simple explanation of this effect based on the central limit theorem , and verified numerically in several cases that the argument holds .",
    "similarly , the reduced @xmath23-centrality of a node is also proportional to its degree , for large degrees , on any graph . with the same type of argument it is possible to show that the authority score of a node is proportional to its indegree , for large indegrees , when the outdegrees of all nodes are ( approximately ) the same .",
    "we conclude that there are often strong relations between our centrality measured and ( in)degree : some relations hold on particular graphs and/or limits , others are more general .",
    "these findings imply that the measures are often strongly correlated with each other .",
    "we have indeed seen that the rankings of nodes according to the centrality measures we have considered are quite close to each other for indegree , pagerank , eigenvector centrality and authority score on graphs built with the prescription of dorogovtsev , mendes and samukhin .",
    "we have shown in the paper that these graphs have special properties , and that some measures may be correlated to each other . instead ,",
    "on real graphs , like the networks of political blogs and the sample of the web graph we have considered , the structure is less regular and the measures are far less correlated to each other , as confirmed by the small values of the kendall s @xmath112 for each pair of centrality measures .",
    "this means that , for practical purposes , and in spite of their similarities , spectral centrality measures look at nodes from different perspectives , and allow to diversify their roles within the network , obtaining in this way more information about the importance of nodes .",
    "the scores computed from spectral centrality measures can complement the information about node s centrality derived from more traditional measures like node betweenness  @xcite .",
    "this is especially important for directed graphs , where node betweenness , as well as other measures based on geodesic paths , like closeness  @xcite , are not well defined ."
