    "the dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a thermal bath is of great interest in many branches of physics @xcite .",
    "this topic is of practical importance because no system apart from the universe as a whole is actually isolated .",
    "the contemporary focus on quantum computation @xcite has been providing added impetus to these studies , as has the need to understand collision - affected neutrino oscillation dynamics in astrophysical and cosmological settings @xcite . from a fundamental perspective , the effect of system - bath interactions on quantal coherence in the system bears on the measurement problem and on the emergence of classical behavior out of an underlying quantum dynamics @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will revisit two closely related phenomena that arise in the limit of very rapid system - bath interactions : freezing ( or quantum zeno effect ) and motional narrowing ( or synchronization ) .",
    "our intentions are twofold : ( i ) to present a unified perspective on these effects that emphasizes their connection with each other , and their connections to general quantal coherence and measurement questions .",
    "( ii ) to extend the analysis to incorporate fermi - dirac statistics , a potentials with time dependent bias , and 2-particle entangles states .",
    "for definiteness we will focus on a double - well system , which turns out to be a versatile container for exemplifying and coordinating a number of phenomena .",
    "however almost all of our considerations can be carried over to other arenas , e. g. spin systems .",
    "what we call freezing in this paper , the drastic slowing of a process through environmental interactions , can be discussed in a number of ways .",
    "if we start with an oscillator of some kind , and crank up a damping parameter to the point that the oscillator hardly budges in any reasonable amount of time , we might call the system overdamped . if we start with a decaying system on which we make very rapid measurements to see whether the original state is still there and find that the system has hardly evolved , we call it the quantum zeno effect ( qze ) @xcite . except for the fact that something has been slowed , two behaviors that are described",
    "so differently appear to have little in common .",
    "but when the `` over - damped '' behavior in the oscillator comes from interactions with a quantum thermal bath , and the  observation \" in the qze is replaced by interactions of the system with such a bath as well , then we find that the two terminologies can describe the same essential physics .",
    "if we particularize the `` oscillator '' in the above to the case of a particle in a symmetrical double - well , then it turns out that we must require the bath interaction to distinguish left from right in order for freezing to occur ; hereafter we shall refer to such a bath as  side - sensing \" . correspondingly , for the particle - decay prototype of the qze , in order to simulate rapid measurements",
    "the bath must sense the presence or absence of the initial particle . for the widely discussed two - state systems ,",
    "the freezing phenomenon is essentially the same whether they are double - well systems originating in a condensed matter context @xcite , molecules @xcite @xcite , nuclear spins , squids @xcite , or neutrinos in the early universe @xcite .    in practical circumstances we shall want to know the answer to quantitative questions such as how frozen a system becomes as a result of bath interactions , the answers to which can be roughly expressed in terms of ratios of the different time scales in the problem .",
    "we also want to know how the slowing or freezing behavior is correlated to other calculable phenomena in the system .",
    "these two effects seem to be identical at the formal level .",
    "they carry different names as a result of arising in very different physical contexts .",
    "synchronization is a natural partner to the slowing or freezing phenomena for the case in which the bath does _ not _ distinguish which of the two states the two - state system is in .",
    "we shall describe such a coupling as `` side - blind '' . for a pure two state system , this describes an interaction that does nothing at all of note .",
    "but in our example of an electron in a symmetrical double well we may wish to place the system in a bath that can excite or deexcite the states that are higher lying than the first two ( i.e. higher lying than the nearly degenerate symmetrical and anti - symmetrical combinations of the single - well ground states ) .",
    "we shall refer to the inclusion of these states as the introduction of a `` vertical '' coordinate , using `` horizontal '' to denote the left and right coordinate .",
    "the oscillation rates are different for the higher - lying states , so that the density matrix for a particle that is , say , initially on one side of the well no longer oscillates sinusoidally between the two states .",
    "but in the limit of large  side - blind \" coupling to the bath the simple sinusoidal behavior is restored , as though the different frequencies had been made the same , and the oscillations of the different vertical components synchronized .",
    "similar behavior in a neutrino - based example has been reported in ref .",
    " motional narrowing \" has been used to describe analogous behavior in an nmr system @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , motion narrowing occurs when the system is made to change state so rapidly that it is only able to respond to an average hamiltonian .",
    "that is , the `` horizontal '' evolution is governed by parameters which are averaged over the `` vertical '' states .",
    "in this paper we review the basic analysis required to establish the above assertions , including the derivation of a master equation , all in the double - well context , and we provide some plots of typical behavior of the solutions .",
    "then we investigate a number of new topics related to the limits mentioned above :      this entails writing a modified master equation to take into account fermi statistics .",
    "the solutions , in the limit of large  side - blind \" noise , have a counterintuitive property : an assemblage of several particles can move sinusoidally from one side to the other , giving the appearance of being in the same state .",
    "this is like the familiar case of two spin degrees of freedom ; in our well realizations we utilize two independent particles in the well , each particle with the same structure of vertical levels .",
    "we can now study entanglement of the horizontal states . in the presence of moderate ",
    "side - blind \" noise we find rapid destruction of entanglement , while in the `` synchronizing '' limit of large  side - blind \" noise we have , in contrast , perfect preservation of entanglement .",
    "the latter may find application in quantum information studies , just as its freezing cousin has already done @xcite .",
    "if we add a variable bias to the symmetrical well , so that one side is deeper than the other , we can perform interesting numerical experiments in which the bias is slowly changed from one sign to the other . in the absence of the coupling to the thermal bath ,",
    "a particle localized on one side can be permanently transported to the other side through an adiabatic reversal of sign of the bias .",
    "when moderate ",
    "side - blind \" noise is added , we find that instead of the near 100% transportation of the uncoupled case we obtain a final distribution with approximately 50% of the probability on either side . however , in the presence of strong  side - blind \" noise we find the efficiency of the transportation to be restored .",
    "we discuss the connection between system - bath interactions and quantum measurement .",
    "we show that the system - apparatus - environment entanglement needed within the emerging paradigm for the description of quantum measurements can arise naturally in our context for the side - sensing case .      in section [ freezesynch ]",
    "we specify our system - bath hamiltonian and the corresponding master equation for the system .",
    "we then discuss both the synchronized and frozen behavior and include an extension to the case of multi - particle systems with fermi statistics .",
    "at the end of this section we analyse the case of the double well with a time dependent bias , focussing on avoided level crossing transitions . in section [ entangle ]",
    "we determine the evolution of entangled well states under the influence of side - blind noise .",
    "we discuss the side - sensing and side - blind interactions from a measurement theoretic perspective in section [ meas ] and in section [ conc ] we conclude .",
    "we focus on those situations where the effect of system - bath interactions on the dynamics of the system can be derived from a master equation for the reduced density matrix of the system .",
    "the horizontal `` spin '' coordinate of the @xmath2-state system ( where @xmath3 for the double well ) is indexed with greek letters , while the vertical energy variables will be denoted @xmath4 .",
    "the system basis states are denoted @xmath5 .",
    "the dynamics of the system uncoupled to the bath is governed by the hamiltonian , @xmath6    \\label{1}\\ ] ] we will study the case @xmath7 for all values @xmath8 .",
    "this means that the energy eigenstates fall into nearly degenerate pairs near each @xmath4 , and the energy splittings within these pairs are always much smaller than the spacings @xmath9 between the pairs ( single - well spacings ) .",
    "consider a reduced density matrix for the system @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 is the complete density matrix of the model . at an initial time",
    "@xmath12 we choose a form diagonal in the vertical indices , @xmath13 for these initial conditions , one of the results of a master equation derivation is that for times @xmath14 , the operator @xmath15 remains so nearly diagonal in the vertical ( energy ) indices that we can continue to describe the system by a vector in the energy space , @xmath16 , replacing ( @xmath17 ) by ( @xmath18 ) in eq.([2 ] ) .",
    "henceforth we suppress the indices @xmath19 in the horizontal space , in which @xmath20 remains an operator .",
    "we now have to supply a model for the system - bath interaction . a natural and simple case to consider is a factorised form , @xmath21 where @xmath22 operates on the horizontal indices and @xmath23 depends only on the vertical coordinates and the coordinates of the bath .",
    "this coupling is also taken to be weak , in a way that allows the problem to be solved , although it can at the same time be strong in another sense : we will eventually study the limiting case where the system - bath interaction rate is much larger than the free oscillation rates of the system .    in the appendix , we show that for this form of coupling the master equations , generalized to include the vertical structure , are of the form , @xmath24+\\sum_{j}\\zeta\\ , \\rho(e_j , t)\\,\\zeta \\,\\gamma(e_j , e_i ) \\nonumber\\\\ & - & { 1\\over 2}\\bigr(\\zeta^2\\ , \\rho(e_i , t)+\\rho(e_i , t ) \\,\\zeta^2 \\bigr ) \\sum_{j}\\gamma(e_i , e_j ) .",

    "all of the elements in eq.([3 ] ) are matrices in the horizontal space except for the rate functions @xmath25 .",
    "they obey the relation @xmath26\\gamma(e_i , e_j)\\ ] ] due to the thermal equilibrium of the bath .",
    "for the neutrino application , and with the right identifications , eq.([3 ] ) gives the  quantum kinetic equations \" derived by mckellar and thomson @xcite .",
    "they can also be found in the nmr literature , for example in ref .",
    "the derivation in the appendix produces the equations in the context needed for our present results .",
    "we now specialize to the symmetrical double well .",
    "the two - dimensional horizontal space consists of the left and right sides of the well , conveniently labelled by the eigenvalues of @xmath27 , namely @xmath28 for the particle to be on the left ( right ) side .",
    "the barrier height is chosen to be large compared to @xmath9 .",
    "the vertical states are the single well energy excitations .",
    "we take @xmath29_{\\alpha\\beta}g(e_i)\\ ] ] in order to model the free oscillations between left and right .",
    "the energy splittings @xmath30 , which are essentially tunneling rates , have strong @xmath4 dependence . for the `` spin '' dependence of the coupling to the bath",
    "we take , @xmath31 where the parameter @xmath32 plays the important role of modelling the horizontal structure of the system - bath interaction . in the case",
    "@xmath33 , the transition matrix elements of the operator @xmath34 for @xmath35 in the left - hand well , considered by themselves , are the same as those for the right - hand well , as would be the case in the dipole approximation of the interaction with a radiation field . for the case @xmath36 , only the amplitude on the left - hand ( right - hand ) side of the well interacts with the bath . in other words , @xmath37 describes left - right symmetric ( maximally asymmetric ) system - bath couplings : side - blind ( maximally side - sensing ) in other words .",
    "as we review below , frozen behavior arises as a limiting case for @xmath38 couplings , while synchronization or motional narrowing occurs as a limiting case when @xmath33 .",
    "the function @xmath39 is the ( single well ) rate for a state @xmath4 to make a transition to state @xmath40 . when @xmath41 , the bath induced transitions among the vertical states are dynamically important . in this case",
    "our models differ substantively from models that do not have the vertical structure .    as an example we use a double square well with infinite barriers to the left and right of @xmath42 , and with a central barrier of width @xmath43 and height @xmath44 .",
    "we choose @xmath44 and the particle mass such that twenty states are bound with energies less than @xmath44 .",
    "the low - lying states are thus very nearly the symmetrical and anti - symmetrical combinations of separate states in an infinite well of width @xmath45 .",
    "the energy splittings , @xmath30 are easy to calculate in the limit of small tunneling .    for the bath",
    "we take bosons with @xmath46 , equal energy spacing @xmath47 where @xmath48 , and with creation and annihilation operators , @xmath49 .",

    "the transition rates in the bath interaction part of eq.([3 ] ) are then , @xmath58 . \\label{11}\\ ] ]    we will now display solutions to the master equations for the cases @xmath33 and @xmath38 .",
    "we first consider side - blind system - bath couplings , so that @xmath33 , and we solve eq.([3 ] ) for several values of @xmath60 .",
    "the resulting curves are labeled with a ratio @xmath1 that is proportional to @xmath60 , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the thermal average of the oscillation rates , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 that of the bath induced transition rates , @xmath65 .",
    "figure 1 shows the probability that a particle beginning on the left side in a thermal distribution will be on the left side at time @xmath18 .",
    "we choose temperature @xmath66 in units of the single - well ground state energy .    [ cols=\">,^ \" , ]     for small to moderate @xmath1 values , we observe the gradual relaxation and decay of entanglement arising from the population of energy levels with different frequencies . for large values of @xmath1 , we obtain synchronised behaviour , where the evolution of the system resembles that of two isolated qubits , with @xmath67 replaced by an averaged frequency @xmath68",
    ". that is , despite the strong coupling to the bath , the system behaves , effectively , as though it were isolated . in the limit @xmath69",
    ", we see the persistance of maximal entanglement .",
    "finally , note that entanglement may be created or destroyed if the hamiltonian were to have a term describing an interaction between the two qubits . in the large @xmath1 limit",
    "this process will also proceed as if the system were isolated , with the hamiltonian parameters replaced by their averaged values .",
    "the freezing phenomenon or qze is well known .",
    "it should be noted , though , that much of the recent non - neutrino literature does not study systems with a vertical structure .",
    "indeed , when the vertical structure is removed eq.([3 ] ) reduces to the familiar form , @xmath70 - \\frac{\\gamma}{2}[\\ , \\zeta,\\ , [ \\ , \\zeta,\\ , \\rho\\ , ] \\ , ] .\\ ] ] the decoherence term is then simply @xmath71\\ , ] = - 2 b^2 \\gamma \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & \\rho_{12 } \\\\ \\rho^{*}_{12 } & 0 \\end{array } \\right),\\ ] ] from which freezing can be deduced in the large @xmath1 limit , provided that @xmath38 .",
    "the presence of vertical states evidently does not alter these qualitative conclusions : freezing occurs at large @xmath1 for @xmath38 whether vertical structure exists or not .",
    "the above derivation also shows that @xmath33 system - bath interactions have no affect on the system in the absence of vertical structure .",
    "but , when it is not absent , we have seen that there is an interesting conceptual cousin to the @xmath38 quantum zeno effect : synchronization ( or motional narrowing ) when @xmath33 .",
    "both occur in the @xmath0 limit , when the dynamics of the system is dominated by its interactions with the bath .",
    "while synchronization from motional narrowing is a known phenomenon , we have not found a clear and comprehensive discussion in the literature about its relationship with the qze , quantal coherence and measurement , so we now provide one .",
    "the strong connection between freezing / synchronization and coherence is revealed by the evolution of entropy .",
    "pure states always have vanishing entropy .",
    "decoherence in the system induced by system - bath interactions can cause initially pure states to evolve into mixed states . in this case",
    "the entropy increases towards a maximum which is attained when all states in the statistical mixture are equally populated , with complete decoherence .",
    "we have to be careful to distinguish between what one may call vertical and horizontal contributions to entropy . as explained when we discussed fig .  2 ,",
    "the entropy of our system starts out being nonzero because of the thermalization in the vertical variable .",
    "we are really interested in whether or not @xmath72 increases from this initial offset , because that change would be caused by growing horizontal disorder .",
    "but we have seen that a system initially in a horizontal eigenstate experiences no entropy increase for any value of @xmath32 in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "this means that the system evolves in a pure - state manner ( subtracting off the initial vertically induced offset ) , despite having its dynamics dominated by interactions with the bath : environmental decoherence hits a maximum at an intermediate value of @xmath1 , not in the limit @xmath0 . for @xmath38 ,",
    "this is in a sense pyrrhic victory over decoherence since it comes at the cost of freezing . for @xmath33 on the other hand ,",
    "the ensemble described by the reduced density matrix evolves nontrivially as if it were a single isolated particle undergoing unitary evolution at an averaged frequency .    whether freezing or synchronization results in the large @xmath1 limit depends on how the bath couples to the system .",
    "if the bath is side - sensing , ( @xmath38 ) then freezing happens ; if it is side - blind ( @xmath33 ) , then synchronization occurs .",
    "it has often been remarked that the qze case is connected with the measurement process .",
    "since the environment has a @xmath38 coupling , it can `` tell the difference '' between left and right sides of the well , and thus `` measure '' this observable ( the hermitian operator @xmath27 ) . when @xmath0 , the system - bath `` measurement '' interactions happen repeatedly and quickly ( constant monitoring ) , forcing the system to remain in the same @xmath27 eigenstate ( or more generally to remain in the same statistical mixture of eigenstates ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the coupling is of @xmath33 form , then there is no sense in which the environment probes whether the system is in the left or right state , and therefore it can not `` measure '' and thus freeze @xmath27 .",
    "the oscillations between left and right are undamped , but the system states transform between vertical @xmath4 levels so rapidly that they effectively all oscillate at the same averaged frequency .",
    "these are heuristic observations , as indicated by the scare quotes around key phrases and words .",
    "it would be useful to make the connection between @xmath32 and measurement more rigorous .",
    "this should be possible in light of the recent clarification of how exactly measurement can be modeled in quantum theory .",
    "the emerging paradigm connects the measurement process to entanglement between system , apparatus and environment states @xcite .",
    "we will see that microscopic collisions between a system particle and a spin-@xmath73 boson from the bath can be interpreted as inducing this sort of entanglement in the @xmath38 case .. ] so , the microscopic perspective will provide us with a simple explanation for why the @xmath38 and @xmath33 cases are different , and indeed why the former is connected with measurement .",
    "these considerations will not capture the full complexity of the phenomena generated by the master equations ( synchronization in particular ) , but they will furnish some physical insight .",
    "we first briefly summarize the emerging paradigm .",
    "the world is divided into three parts : system , apparatus and environment .",
    "suppose that the system is initially in state @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is an eigenstate of @xmath76 , the system observable that the apparatus can measure .",
    "initially , we take the apparatus and environment to be in states @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectievly .",
    "we also suppose that initially there are no correlations between the three subsystems , so the state of the world begins as simply @xmath79 . by time @xmath80 ,",
    "the system and apparatus have unitarily evolved into the entangled state @xmath81 , so that a correlation now exists between eigenstates of the system @xmath75 and some basis states @xmath82 for the apparatus . in the typical picture ,",
    "the environment at this `` pre - measurement '' stage remains uncorrelated with the system - plus - apparatus hybrid .",
    "the measurement is not complete at this stage because quantal correlations exist between the `` outcomes '' . by time",
    "@xmath83 , however , we suppose that unitary evolution has also entangled the environment with the apparatus , in a way such that each apparatus state @xmath75 is linked to a distinct environmental state , @xmath84 . now",
    "the world is in the fully correlated state @xmath85 the final step is to argue that the environment states @xmath84 are by definition inaccessible or uninteresting , so one should trace over them to obtain the reduced density matrix for system - plus - apparatus .",
    "doing this we obtain @xmath86 where we have taken the environment states to be orthonormal , and we have defined @xmath87 .",
    "this reduced density matrix describes a mixture of states which have _ classically _ correlated system - apparatus variables .",
    "the measurement is complete , with all _ quantal _ correlations between system and apparatus having diffused into the environment , thus effectively becoming lost .",
    "we will now connect this schematic to our case by examining a microscopic energy - changing collision between a system particle and a spin-@xmath73 bath boson @xmath88 .",
    "we previously called the hilbert space spanned by the horizontal _ and _ vertical states as the `` system '' .",
    "it is now useful to change perspective .",
    "let us redefine `` system '' to mean the hilbert space spanned by just the horizontal eigenstates ( left or right ) , with the `` apparatus '' being spanned by the vertical states ( single well energy eigenstates labeled by @xmath89 ) . the environment is spanned by the energy states @xmath90 of @xmath88 .",
    "the initial state is @xmath91 \\otimes |e\\rangle , \\label{initialstate}\\ ] ] the left and right eigenstates being @xmath92 label the nearly degenerate double - well states collectively indexed by the vertical designation @xmath89 .",
    "free unitary evolution takes the inital state in eq.([initialstate ] ) to @xmath93 \\otimes |e\\rangle\\ ] ] at time @xmath18 , where @xmath94 .",
    "we will ignore the unimportant overall phase factor in the following .",
    "suppose a collision with a bath boson occurs at the time @xmath18 ( we are assuming that the interaction time is very short compared to the mean free path ) . for simplicity",
    ", consider the extreme case @xmath95 so that only @xmath96 states interact with @xmath88 , and work in one spatial dimension .",
    "the latter idealisation , which is inessential , leads to the final energies being completely determined by kinetic energy and momentum conservation from the initial energies @xmath89 and @xmath97 . immediately after the collision ,",
    "the state of the system is @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 . to @xmath101 for the left eigenstate .",
    "] this is already in the fully entangled form of eq.([fullycorrelated ] ) ; there is no distinct pre - measurement step .",
    "we now trace over the @xmath88 energy states to obtain the reduced density matrix latexmath:[\\[|c_1(t)|^2 |l\\ , , \\",
    ", e'\\rangle \\langle l\\ , , \\ , e'| +    precise by the comparison of the above simple argument with the general schema , the measurement of the horizontal variable is complete .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath33 , then eq.([beq1 ] ) is replaced by @xmath103 \\otimes |e'\\rangle , \\label{beq2}\\ ] ] whose reduced density matrix is that for the pure state @xmath104 .",
    "there is no entanglement with the environment .",
    "the horizontal quantity remains unmeasured , even though there has been an energy changing collision with a bath boson .",
    "it is interesting that it makes sense to consider the vertical states as spanning an apparatus which measures the horizontal states .",
    "we began by considering a three - part division of the world ( horizontal , vertical , bath ) for other reasons , but apparently this same partition provides a framework for interpreting aspects of the @xmath38 dynamics as a canonical measurement process .",
    "indeed , our master equation incorporating both horizontal and vertical states then precisely specifies the dynamics of what can be interpreted as a system - plus - apparatus hybrid .",
    "we can sharpen this point .",
    "suppose we put some particles into one of the energy eigenstate of an isolated well .",
    "they oscillate between the left and right states at a given frequency . at time @xmath105",
    "( bath time ) suddenly immerse it in a @xmath95 , @xmath0 bath . if the particles phases happen to place them entirely in the left state at this time , then the system quickly becomes thermalised in energy and frozen in the left eigenstate .",
    "now remove the system from the bath .",
    "if a thermalised distribution of oscillating particles is seen , then we know that the horizontal state was measured to be `` left '' . on the other hand , if the phases at @xmath105 happen to place all of the particles in the right eigenstate , then the system will remain unchanged in energy but frozen in the right eigenstate . upon removal from the bath",
    ", we see a non - thermalised distribution and hence we know the measurement yielded `` right '' .",
    "we have analysed behaviors that can be exhibited by a quantum system that is coupled to a thermal bath .",
    "the system states were taken to have both a horizontal and a vertical structure .",
    "the horizontal states are discrete and the system is generally in a superposition of them .",
    "familiar examples are the left and right sides of a symmetrical double well , the case we focussed on , and neutrino flavor .",
    "the vertical states are labeled by the energy eigenvalues . a `` dynamical superselection rule '' induced by decohering interactions with the bath",
    "quickly eliminates superpositions in the vertical direction .",
    "however , the same system - bath coupling induces system transitions between the vertical states .",
    "the limit where the system - bath interaction rates were much larger than the free oscillation rates of the system was our particular concern .",
    "two qualitatively different , but complementary , limiting cases were analysed .",
    "the frozen or quantum zeno case arises when the system - bath interactions distinguish between the horizontal states ( side - sensing ) .",
    "the synchronized or motionally narrowed case arises , by contrast , when the system - bath interactions are blind to the horizontal structure ( side - blind ) .",
    "the latter can only be observed when the vertical structure is present , whereas the former obtains even when the system is vertically trivial .",
    "two extensions were made : to a double - well containing fermions , where the effect of fermi statistics was fully incorporated into the master equation ; and to potentials with a time - dependent bias . in the synchronization limit , the multi - fermion system presents a behavior which gives the illusion that all of the fermions are in the same state , evolving coherently .",
    "when there is a time - dependent bias , the synchronization limit can lead to an increase in the efficiency of transformation from one horizontal state into the other .",
    "we then examined the time evolution of bipartite entanglement - of - formation in the face of side - blind system - bath interactions .",
    "entanglement was observed to at first decrease with increasing system - bath coupling strength .",
    "however , when the synchronization limit was reached , entanglement was found to be preserved .",
    "the connection between freezing / qze on the one hand , and synchronization / motional - narrowing on the other , and measurement was clarified . by adopting the emerging `` system + apparatus + environment '' paradigm for quantal measurement , we were able to show that microscopic energy - changing interactions between a system particle and a bath boson can be naturally interpreted as measurement events in the horizontal observable .",
    "the tripartite subdivision `` horizontal + vertical + bath '' was mapped on to `` system + apparatus + environment '' in the process .    in closing",
    ", we would like to note that the synchronization or motional narrowing limit should be useful in applications such as quantum computation which exploit quantal coherence and entanglement .",
    "the experimental or engineering challenge would be to construct devices whose active or horizontal system elements are deliberately placed in a noisy environment , but one that couples to all horizontal states equally strongly .",
