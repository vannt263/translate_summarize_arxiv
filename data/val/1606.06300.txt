    "in a circuit of capacitively coupled metallic islands , static screening describes the redistribution of polarization charges on the capacitive plates of the islands in response to a static offset charge on one of the islands .",
    "the resulting voltages are determined by a ( screened ) poisson equation .",
    "the way in which the solution decays with the distance from the offset charge depends on the effective circuit dimensionality . in one - dimensional networks , the polarization charge generically is constant up to the screening length and then follows a purely exponential decay . for metallic islands coupled by capacitances @xmath0 ,",
    "the screening length @xmath1 is determined by the ratio of @xmath0 to the capacitances @xmath2 of the islands to ground.@xcite    josephson junctions in superconducting circuits add an interesting twist to the screening of static offset charge configurations .",
    "conventional , linear inductances coupling two metal grains are normally not of interest since they invalidate the notion of islands with well - defined offset charges .",
    "in contrast , nonlinear josephson inductances only allow tunneling of single cooper - pairs such that offset charge can not simply flow off an island contacted by a junction . while josephson junctions formally leave charge quantization on the islands intact , charge quantization effects are effectively weakened by large quantum fluctuations of the charge when the charging energy @xmath3 of the islands is much smaller than the josephson energy @xmath4 .",
    "this gives rise to what we will in the following refer to as nonlinear screening , an effect that has been exploited very successfully in the transmon qubit  @xcite .    in the regime of dominating josephson energy , the dynamics of a single junction",
    "is dominated by quantum phase slips corresponding to tunneling of the superconducting phase difference by @xmath5 .",
    "for one - dimensional chains of josephson junctions coupling the islands , the effects of phase slips have been extensively studied theoretically both in infinite  @xcite and finite  @xcite networks in the past .",
    "there has also been considerable effort in studying these systems experimentally  @xcite .",
    "although many junctions are present in these systems , the junctions are not strongly coupled such that the dynamics are dominated by independent phase - slip events of the individual junctions and interactions do not play a crucial role .     in a )",
    "we show a conventional one dimensional infinite chain of capacitors with capacitance @xmath0 .",
    "each island is connected to the ground by a capacitance @xmath2 .",
    "there is a fixed bias charge @xmath6 on a single island , inducing charges on the neighboring capacitor plates .",
    "however , due to the ground capacitances there is an exponential screening of this charge along the chain . at each island a fraction of the induced charge is stored on the ground capacitance so that the charge on the coupling capacitances @xmath0 decays exponentially with the distance to the original bias charge .",
    "the system in b ) is similar to the system in a ) with a josephson junction ( josephson energy @xmath4 ) providing an additional shunt to the ground",
    ". induced charges can now also be screened by tunneling through the josephson junction , giving rise to a novel nonlinear screening behavior . ]",
    "while the nonlinear screening effected by a single josephson junction as in the transmon is well - studied , the screening properties of systems of many junctions that are strongly coupled have not been investigated to the best of our knowledge .",
    "motivated by the efficient screening of a single transmon , we therefore study a one - dimensional system of transmons that are strongly coupled by large capacitances @xmath0 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] .",
    "this corresponds to a system of superconducting islands that are coupled by capacitances @xmath0 and shunted to ground by a josephson junction with josephson energy @xmath4 and associated capacitance @xmath2 .",
    "we are interested in a regime of nonlinear screening dominated by the josephson junctions which corresponds to a very small capacitance @xmath2 to ground with associated large ( linear ) screening length @xmath1 .",
    "phase slips dominate when the josephson energy @xmath4 is much larger than the energy @xmath7 associated with a nonzero voltage with respect to the ground on a single island .",
    "we will show below that the nonlinear screening due to the josephson junctions leads to a universal power - law decay of the electron - electron interaction with power two .",
    "this implies a power - law decay of the polarization charge markedly different from the conventional exponential decay obtained for static screening due to capacitances .",

    "to study the screening effect of the system in the presence of bias charges on selected islands , we need the additional lagrangian @xmath23 which implements the bias charges @xmath24 on the @xmath9-th island .",
    "this term is special for two reasons : on one hand , it is a total time derivative and thus does not enter the classical equations of motion . on the other hand ,",
    "it is imaginary so that it only adds a phase to the partition function underlining its nonclassicality .    from the free energy @xmath25",
    ", we can calculate the ground state energy @xmath26 of the system by applying the low temperature limit @xmath27 the aim of this work is to calculate this ground state energy as a function of two bias charges and use it to gain information about the screening behavior of the chain .",
    "we are in particular interested in the regime where @xmath28 so that the conventional capacitance to the ground @xmath2 is very small and the josephson junctions are mainly responsible for any charge screening on the islands . from the fact that @xmath29 , we know that the ground state of the system will be well - localized in the phase variables @xmath8 . therefore , the main contributions in ( [ eq : partitionsum ] ) are due to paths starting and ending in the minimum of the cosine potentials",
    ". as we are only interested in exponential accuracy for the calculation of the ground state energy with ( [ eq : lowtemplimit ] ) , we can set @xmath30 and omit the integral over @xmath14 .",

    "the vector @xmath35 with components @xmath13 encodes the winding sector and @xmath36 with components @xmath24 is the vector of bias charges . as we are analyzing a regime where the phases are good variables , fluctuations around the classical paths defined by the solutions of the euler - lagrange equations ( corresponding to @xmath18 ) are small .",
    "hence , we apply an instanton approximation where we replace the path integral by a sum over all classical solutions , while quantum fluctuations around the classical paths play just a sub - dominant role . in general , the main contribution to these fluctuations arise from gaussian integration of the action expanded to second order around the classical paths .",
    "we assume that the fluctuations can be factorized so that they simply renormalize the bare parameters .",

    "every step ( phase slip ) in the curve is described by an instanton particle localized in time .",
    "the action corresponding to such a path can be approximated by the action of a single phase slip times the number of total phase slips .",
    "this is possible because the constant parts of the steps do not contribute to the action . ]",
    "an example of such a simple path for just a single island ( only one @xmath13 is different from 0 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : path ] .",
    "the fact that we analyze the semi - classical regime where the phase is well - localized allows to use the dilute instanton gas approximation .",
    "the approximation holds as the phase - slip rate is so small that the phase slips ( instantons ) are well separated from each other , i.e. , there is at most a single phase slip present within the duration @xmath43 of a single phase - slip process .",
    "thus , the classical paths consist of almost instantaneous individual phase slips that are well - separated in ( imaginary ) time .",
    "these phase slips are centered at their occurrence times @xmath44 for the @xmath9-th phase slip . in between the phase slips",
    ", the phase stays constant . in that way",
    ", we treat paths with more than a single phase slip at the same island as independent phase slips , i.e. , there is no temporal interaction between the instantons . as a consequence",
    "the total action is simply the sum of individual instanton contributions @xcite .",
    "however , simultaneous phase slips at different islands can not be treated independently because they are subject to a spatial interaction due to the coupling between the islands .",
    "therefore , this case needs special treatment that we deal with in the next section .    in principle",
    "we also have to calculate the prefactor @xmath45 due to the fluctuations around the classical action .",
    "these fluctuations are not important when it comes to exponential accuracy .",
    "however , due to time translation invariance , in the single instanton sector , the second - order integration for the fluctuations additionally contains an integration of a zero mode , corresponding to a simple shift of the full instanton solution in time .",
    "we separate the prefactor @xmath46 into a factor @xmath47 containing the real fluctuations on one side and the imaginary time interval @xmath48 resulting from the zero mode integration on the other side .",
    "thus , every contribution is weighted by the fluctuations @xmath47 and the length of the time intervall @xmath48 in which we consider the evolution of the system . for a single instanton on a single island , which is a noninteracting problem",
    ", it is known that @xmath49 ( compare , e.g. , to refs .  ) . however , as the precision of this prefactor is not as important as the precision for the exponentiated instanton action we assume the single instanton value @xmath50 to be sufficient even for the interacting problem with many simultaneous instantons at different islands@xcite .",
    "this approximation is appropriate because the terms become smaller with the number of instantons such that in the end only prefactors @xmath51 with a moderate amount of instantons are relevant .",
    "example configuration of the system where we have sliced the time dimension into a lattice to better visualize the finite time an instanton process needs .",
    "the arrows pointing up correspond to instantons , while the arrows pointing down correspond to anti - instantons .",
    "( anti-)instantons occurring at the same time are subject to a spatial interaction ( here marked by the same gray scale ) and add a contribution to the full action given by their equal - time action . for the full partition function , we need to sum over all possible configurations . to that end , we consider each phase slip event at an island as a particle with the island position , occurrence time and instanton type as generalized coordinates . in this picture",
    ", evaluating the full partition function corresponds to calculating the the classical grand - canonical partition function of the particles . ]",
    "considering a single island with a single phase variable , the dilute instanton gas approximation allows to treat the different phase slips ( in imaginary time ) independently .",

    "therefore , in this section , we determine the irreducible equal - time action @xmath52 including the simultaneous phase - slip processes explicitly . for a proper definition of the equal - time action , we use the fact that within a time interval of size @xmath53 there can be at most a single phase slip per island . together with the diluteness of the instanton gas , it is convenient to define the equal - time action as the action picked up by the total system in a time window @xmath53 around a given time @xmath54 . in this context",

    "moreover , since the system does not pick up any action as long as the phases are constant , we can extend the time - integration from minus infinity to plus infinity as the phases are only nonconstant for the short time interval @xmath53 around @xmath54 .",

    "[ fig : clustervars ] ) corresponding to the expression @xmath162 by considering solely the terms depending on both charges in the result for @xmath163 , we find the interaction energy @xmath164\\cos[\\pi(q_0+q_m)/e]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad\\quad+\\bigl[e^{2u(m)}-1\\bigr]\\cos[\\pi(q_0-q_m)/e]\\biggr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for large enough @xmath119 , we have @xmath165 and can therefore expand the interaction energy in @xmath166 with the result @xmath167 in this approximation , the charge interaction is directly proportional to the instanton - interaction @xmath168 and obeys a decay proportional to the inverse - square distance between the charges ( below the screening length ) .",
    "in the final section , we return to the original question about the charge screening effect of josephson junctions . in a first step ,",
    "we treat the case of a single bias charge @xmath6 on island @xmath169 .",
    "the presence of a charge on an island induces an average charge on neighboring capacitor plates . to calculate the latter we need to know the average voltages @xmath170 at the different islands ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "we can handle this task by using the results ( [ eq : singleenergy ] ) and ( [ eq : interactionenergy ] ) and employing linear response theory .",
    "the derivative of the ground state energy with respect to an external parameter gives the average value of the derivative of the action with respect to the same parameter . from ( [ eq : biaschargelagrangian ] ) and ( [ eq : lowtemplimit ] ) and the time translation invariance in the system , we obtain that the voltages @xmath170 are given by the derivative of the ground state energy @xmath26 with respect to the bias charge . to this end , we shift the bias charges on the @xmath119-th island such that the ground state energy @xmath172 depends on the small shift @xmath173 .",
    "we then find @xmath174 here , in order to determine the voltages expectation values @xmath170 on island @xmath119 , we have used the josephson relation @xmath175 together with the relation @xmath176 between real and imaginary time .    double logarithmic plots of the voltage @xmath170 induced on island @xmath119 by an offset charge at distance @xmath119 for @xmath177 and @xmath178 . in panel",

    "the screened voltage follows a power - law behavior until the screening length is reached at which point the exponential screening due to the ground capacitances @xmath2 takes over . in b ) we compare the result obtained by using the power - law approximation represented by the dashed line with the black squares representing the full result .",
    "it can be seen that the decay of the induced voltages follows the inverse - square law essentially starting from @xmath179 . ]",
    "the leading contribution to @xmath180 is given by the interaction energy @xmath181 of .",
    "taking the derivative , we obtain the result ( @xmath182 ) @xmath183\\sin(\\pi q_0/e),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be approximated by the expression @xmath184 by expanding the exponential in ( [ eq : seconordervoltage ] ) we see that all even orders cancel so that there are no corrections until the third order in @xmath168 .",
    "this makes the approximation ( [ eq : approxvoltages ] ) already accurate for @xmath185 , where the exponent is smaller than 1 . even in the regime of our interest",
    "@xmath186 , @xmath119 does not have to be too large as @xmath187 scales with the square root of @xmath188 .",
    "hence for intermediate distances ( smaller than the screening length @xmath95 , larger than @xmath189 ) the voltages obey a universal inverse - square decay given by @xmath168 . in figure",
    "[ fig : charges ] we show a plot of the decay of the induced voltages .",
    "note that an additional charge can be treated by adding up the voltage contributions of every single charge .",
    "deviations from this simple rule are induced by a three particle interaction - energy at least .",
    "such contributions appear in three - instanton diagrams or higher and thus they are strongly suppressed . for completeness , we provide also the expression for the voltage on the @xmath169-th island @xmath190 obtained from @xmath191 .    with the voltages at hand , it is a simple task to determine the charges on all capacitor plates . from the relation for capacitors @xmath192 ,",
    "the charge on the capacitor plate on the right of the @xmath119-th island ( relative to the bias charge ) @xmath193 is simply proportional to the voltage difference over the capacitance .",
    "the largest voltage difference can be found between the bias charge island and its two direct neighbors .",
    "here we have to take the difference of the first order contribution ( [ eq : firstordervoltage ] ) and the second - order contribution ( [ eq : seconordervoltage ] ) , where the latter is suppressed by @xmath107 .",
    "thus , the two capacitor plates directly attached to the bias charge island are charged the most . from the second island on",
    ", we only need to take differences of ( [ eq : seconordervoltage ] ) .",
    "this results in the power law decay @xmath194 for @xmath195 .",
    "the result is thus fundamentally different from an exponential decay in usual linear screening .",
    "in this work , we have calculated the effect of josephson junctions on the charge screening in the ground state of an one - dimensional chain of capacitively coupled superconducting islands in the semi - classical limit @xmath29 .",
    "we have solved the problem of the interacting nonlinear system by using an instanton approximation within the quantum statistical path integral approach . to deal with the interactions in the chain ,",
    "we have introduced the equal - time action corresponding to the action picked up by the whole system at a given moment in time .",
    "the latter includes spatial correlations between simultaneous phase slips on different islands .",
    "with this action and a dilute instanton gas approximation , which applies in the regime of interest , we have mapped the task of solving the quantum system onto a classical statistical mechanics problem . with a slightly modified mayer cluster expansion , supporting the interaction with bias charges at selected islands of the chain",
    ", we have calculated a power series of the ground state energy @xmath196 in the number of interacting instantons as a function of two bias charges @xmath6 and @xmath131 .",
    "we have calculated the average induced voltages in the linear response regime and furthermore the induced charges on the capacitor plates .",
    "compared to the known exponential decay for chains without the josephson junctions , we have found that the induced voltages decay with the inverse of the squared distance .",
    "this power - law decay is fundamentally different from the conventional exponential screening .",
