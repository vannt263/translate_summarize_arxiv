    "the acceleration of primary cr protons and the production and acceleration of secondary positrons take place in the same region . according to this study",
    "the resulting positron spectrum would be harder than the primary electron spectrum ( locally having the same index as the primary protons ) and therefore the positron fraction would rise with energy as the data reported by pamela . because this model can also predict the production of antiprotons and secondary nuclei ( b , ti etc . ) , it is suggested that antiproton - to - proton ratio ( @xmath2 ) , boron - to - carbon ratio ( b / c ) and titanium - to - iron ratio ( ti / fe ) would show the excess above @xmath3 per nucleon ( blasi & serpico 2009 ; mertsch & sarkar 2009 ; ahlers et al .",

    "in this study , we discuss the secondary cr positron production process inside the snr taking into account the time - dependent escape of them as well as that of primary cr protons .",

    ", secondary particles produced and accelerated in the snr shock would also escape the source in a time - dependent manner .",
    "therefore , in order to predict the observed spectra of those secondary particles , we should calculate their time - dependent escape from snrs , as well as their production and acceleration .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section 2 , we describe the model of time - dependent escape of primary and secondary cosmic - ray particles from snrs and show the transport equations of them . in section 3 , we solve the transport equation for secondary cosmic - ray positrons , and predict their energy spectrum .",
    "we discuss our results in section 4 , and section 5 is devoted to the summary or this work .",
    "according to the standard theory of dsa , the scattering of particles is due to the turbulent magnetic field around the shock .",
    "especially , in the upstream region , the turbulence is considered to be excited by the accelerated particles themselves ( bell 1978 ) .",
    "then , in the far upstream region which is sufficiently distant from the shock front , because the particle flux should be small , the turbulence would be so weak that the particles can not be backscattered to the shock and escape the snr .",
    "in other words , in the cr escape scenario , we should impose the escape boundary in the upstream with a finite distance ( hereafter , @xmath5 ) from the shock front .",
    "letting @xmath6 be the diffusion coefficient for a particle with momentum of @xmath7 and @xmath8 be the velocity of the shock front , the escape condition for a particle can be described as @xmath9 where the left hand side is the characteristic diffusion length of a particle with momentum @xmath7 .",
    "the escape boundary @xmath10 ( here @xmath11 is the upstream region ) is the point beyond which particle - scattering alfvn waves are absent and therefore the mean free path of particles is much larger than the size of a snr .",
    "zirakashvili & ptuskin ( 2008 ) argued that the distance between the escape boundary and the shock front should be given roughly by the radius of the remnant @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , because of the spherical geometry of a snr shock , the particles which have diffused out from the shock to the distance comparable with the shock radius would not be able to cross the shock again and therefore escape the snr into the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",

    "we have only argued the spectrum of cr particles escaping the snr right after accelerated at the shock . among the accelerated cr particles , those with the momentum lower than @xmath165",
    "are confined in the snr and lose their energy adiabatically ( ptuskin & zirakashvili 2005 ) . strictly speaking ,",
    "in the later time some of them satisfy the condition for the escape , @xmath166 , and then they can escape the snr into the ism together with those accelerated up to @xmath165 at that time .",
    "here we estimate the contribution of such cr component and compare it with that of cr particles escaping the snr right after the acceleration .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the distribution function of accelerated secondary particles at the shock can be approximated as @xmath167 where @xmath168 is a normalization factor which is constant with time .",
    "here we use the facts that in the sedov phase the factors that appear in eq .",
    "( [ f20app ] ) evolve as @xmath169 , @xmath156 , and @xmath170 .",
    "on the other hand , the particles advected downstream lose their energy adiabatically as @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the fluid velocity inside the snr shell . here",
    "we consider the case of a spherically symmetric snr shock and so @xmath172 has only the radial component : @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the radial coordinate in the snr .",
    "this gives us the energy of the particles around the shock @xmath175 as a function of time : @xmath176 using these results , we can evaluate the distribution function of particles that are accelerated at @xmath177 and advected downstream , @xmath178 , at the shock front . as the total number of cr particles inside the snr",
    "is conserved , @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 is the momentum of particles around the shock that had the momentum of @xmath7 at the time of @xmath182 .",
    "then we have @xmath183 and this would be larger than @xmath184 when @xmath185 or , using @xmath186 and @xmath71 for a non - relativistic shock , we can simply write the condition as @xmath187 the right - hand side of this inequality is negative because we are assuming the positive @xmath47 ( i.e. @xmath165 decreases with time ) .",
    "therefore , as long as we consider the case with positive @xmath68 , which is required to account for the observed cosmic - ray spectrum in the context of the energy - dependent cr escape scenario , we can conclude that the flux of cr particles escaping right after the acceleration always always dominates the flux of those advected downstream and suffering from adiabatic cooling inside the snr .",
    "the results presented above show that the positrons which are produced during the acceleration of protons inside the snr and emitted into the ism would have a softer energy spectrum than those of primary protons and electrons .",
    "as is obvious from the discussions above , the same logic can be applied to any secondary particles which are also produced during the acceleration of protons in the snrs . hence ,",
    "if the cr particles accelerated in the snr shock escape the shock in an energy - dependent way , the emergent secondary electron plus positron can not reproduce the ` excess ' in the electron spectrum reported by fermi lat ( abdo et al . 2009a ; ackermann et al . 2010 ) because they should have a softer spectrum than primary electrons .",
    "in addition , the spectrum of antiprotons produced during the acceleration of protons and emitted from snrs would be softer than primary protons , and so the ratio between them @xmath2 would decreases with energy , which is on the contrary to the results presented in blasi & serpico ( 2009 ) .",
    "our results are partly consistent with those presented in previous studies such as blasi ( 2009 ) . in fact , in our formalism , the momentum distribution function of positrons _ at the snr shock _ is expressed as eq.([f_20 ] ) , and we can see that in the limit of @xmath188 this is consistent with eq.(6 ) in blasi ( 2009 ) . as this function is approximately proportional to @xmath189 when @xmath6 is linearly dependent on @xmath7 ,",
    "they conclude that the secondary positron ( and electron ) spectrum would be harder than the primary electron spectrum . however , this distribution function is generally different from that in the ism .",
    "for example , taking into account the energy - dependent escape of cr particles from a snr , even the spectrum of primary cr particles would be softer than that in the source because more and more particles are injected into the acceleration process as the shock sweeps the ism ( ohira et al . 2010 ) . in the case of secondary cr particles produced in a snr , not only the increasing swept - up ism gas particles injected into the shock , but also the evolution of the factor @xmath190 in the distribution function of secondary particles , which does not appear in that of primary particles , is also responsible for the softening of the energy spectrum of cr particles in the ism . considering the deceleration of the snr shock and the decay of the magnetic field and turbulence around the shock ,",
    "it is quite natural to assume that this factor increases with time , and this is just what has never been taken into account in the previous studies on this secondary cr production process in a snr .",
    "as is mentioned in the previous section , because the lower energy positrons escape the snr later , this factor should be larger and then the number flux of escaping positrons would be larger , which makes their time - integrated energy spectrum softer . in the calculations we simply assume that the escape momentum of crs decreases with time as @xmath49 and the normalization factor of their escape flux increases as @xmath63 .",
    "although this cr escape model is very simplified and phenomenological , it can account for the gamma - ray observations of middle - age snrs interacting with molecular clouds ( gabici et al .",
    "2009 ; ohira et al .",
    "2011 ) , and it is worthwhile to discuss this scenario in the various context .",
    "moreover , even if we do not assume the simple power - law dependence on time of the escape momentum , the discussions presented above still hold good as long as the cr particles escape the acceleration site in order from high energies to low energies .",
    "we should mention the total energy of cr positrons emitted from snrs .",
    "as the spectral indices of cr protons and positrons are softer than 2 , most of the energy of these cr particles are carried by those with the lowest energy @xmath191 , and therefore their total energy can be estimated as @xmath192 . from fig .",
    "3 , where we calculate the spectra with typical environmental parameters ( see sec .",
    "3 ) , we can say that the ratio between the total energy of cr positrons escaping the snr to that of secondary cr protons is @xmath193 in our case , which is a significant fraction of observed cr positron energy ratio to protons , @xmath194 . considering the positron production process presented here , this ratio should be proportional to the product of the number density of the ism and the escape time of the lowest energy particles , which is equal to the end of the sedov phase : @xmath195 . from eq.([sedovtime ] ) , we can derive the dependence of the amount of positrons on the environmental parameters of a snr as @xmath196 ; if the supernova is less energetic or if the number density of the ism around the supernova is larger , the amount of secondary positrons emitted from the snr becomes larger .",
    "our discussion may be applied also to the acceleration and escape of secondary cr nuclei such as boron nuclei ( b ) which can be produced by spallation of carbon nuclei ( c ) inside the snr ( mertsch & sarkar 2009 ) .",
    "it may be worthwhile to calculate the total number and energy spectrum of cr borons emitted from snrs within this scenario and give the theoretical lower limit to the b / c ratio in the cr observed at the earth , which will be explored in the wider energy range by ams-02 .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper and left to the future work .",
    "in this paper we have investigated both the acceleration and energy - dependent escape of secondary positrons produced in the snr for the first time .",
    "especially we show that , if we assume that the cr particles with higher energy would escape earlier than lower energy particles into the ism , the energy spectrum of secondary - produced particles escaping the snr would be inevitably softer than that of primary protons .",
    "this implies that the rising of the positron fraction in the energy range of @xmath197 measured by pamela and fermi lat can not be accounted by the positron production during the acceleration of cr protons inside the snr .",
    "therefore , if this cr escape scenario is true , it is implied that in order to account for this anomaly we need other primary sources of positrons with a hard spectral index , such as pulsars , dark matter particles , and so on . with the similar discussion , we can conclude that the cr electron plus positron spectrum can not be hard enough to reproduce the results of fermi lat , and that the antiproton ratio @xmath2 does not rise with energy within this scenario .",
    "these results are on the contrary to those presented in previous studies which have investigated this process .",
