    "in quantum metrology quantum properties such as squeezing and entanglement are employed to improve the precision with which physical quantities can be measured  @xcite .",
    "quantum metrological techniques have been very fruitful in developing new generation of quantum devices that can outperform their classical counterparts . in particular , the framework of quantum metrology is very useful for measurement of physical quantities that do not have an associated operator in quantum theory such as time , phase , temperature , acceleration , etc .",
    "the process of quantum parameter estimation consists of three stages ; the preparation of the probe state of the system , feeding the prepared state into the quantum channel which encodes the parameter of interest into the state of the system and finally decoding the parameter by performing a measurement on the system after it has gone through the channel . in order to reduce the statistical error in the estimation of a physical quantity",
    ", this whole process needs to be optimised .",
    "this is achieved by optimising over both the preparation of the initial state of the system and the measurement of the final state of the system . for a given prepared state ,",
    "the quantum cramr - rao bound provides us with the ultimate precision bound on the measurement of the physical quantities in quantum theory .",
    "+ holevo and helstrom laid the foundations of quantum metrology by phrasing the problem in the context of a communication protocol between two parties  @xcite . in this paradigm alice",
    "chooses a quantum system to encode a message which she then sends to bob .",
    "for example she might choose to use either a spin-@xmath0 system or a quantum harmonic oscillator as carrier of her message .",
    "the message can be encoded as a phase parameter in the state of the spin-@xmath0 particle or in the state of the quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "bob then performs a measurement on the system in order to decode the message , i.e. the encoded phase parameter .",
    "the quality of this communication protocol can be improved by optimisation of both stages of the protocol , namely alice s encoding process and bob s decoding process .",
    "however , standard approaches to quantum communication , such as encoding qubits into polarisation degree of freedom of photons , require that all parties have knowledge of a shared reference frame .",
    "this means that in the absence of such knowledge , the involved parties need to initially establish aligned reference frames . despite the considerable amount of progress in the development of protocols for aligning reference frames such as clock synchronisation and cartesian frame alignment  @xcite , maintaining aligned reference frames",
    "is still a large obstacle in achieving such tasks .",
    "for instance when the parties are in relative motion with respect to each other , the relative orientation of their local reference frames can change in time  @xcite . however , quantum reference frames ( qrf ) enable us to circumvent this problem .",
    "let us briefly explain what qrfs are and in what way they differ from classical reference frames ( crf ) .",
    "+ aharonov and susskind in their seminal papers @xcite , showed that the concept of reference frame can be suitably accommodated in quantum theory . in recent years , such treatment of reference frames in quantum theory , i.e. as quantum objects has led to the formalism of `` _ _ quantum reference frames _ _ '' @xcite .",
    "a qrf is different from its classical counterpart in two ways .",
    "first , due to its quantum nature , it has an inherent uncertainty and the measurement results are only an approximation of what would be obtained using a classical reference frame .",
    "second , each time the qrf is used , it suffers a back - action , which causes the future measurements to be less accurate .",
    "phase measurement of single - rail qubits relative to a qrf has been investigated in  @xcite , while the degradation of a directional qrf has been analysed in  @xcite . in the past few years , the `` _ _ resource theory of quantum reference frames _ _ '' , also known as the `` _ _ resource theory of asymmetry _ _ '' , has been developed .",
    "this resource theory provides us with a very useful framework wherein the qrfs are the `` _ _ resource states _ _ ''",
    "they enable us to achieve quantum information processing tasks without first establishing a shared reference frame .",
    "in such schemes , a qrf stands in for the possibility of performing tasks in the absence of a common crf , in the same way that entangled states allow for the possibility of performing non - local quantum operations .",
    "+ in this paper , we bring to bear the powerful machinery of quantum metrology to study the ultimate precision bounds in measurement of physical parameters with respect to qrfs .",
    "first we explain the connection between the quantum mechanical treatment of reference frames and quantum parameter estimation in the presence of noise .",
    "then we investigate how the ultimate precision in measurement of a parameter decreases due to inaccessibility of a perfect crf . in order to do so , we analyse the decrease in quantum fisher information as a result of not having access to a perfect reference frame for the physical quantity of interest . in particular",
    ", we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for two extreme cases that can occur in quantum parameter estimation with imperfect frames of reference .",
    "the first case is when the absence of a perfect reference frame does not affect the precision with which one can measure the parameter and the second case is when measurement of the parameter of interest is no longer possible due to not having access to a crf .",
    "motivated by this analysis we split the problem into two separate cases .",
    "the first case is when the noise caused by the quantum nature of the rf commutes with the channel of interest and the second case is when the channel of interest and the noise do not commute .",
    "we show how the non - commutative noise allows for the estimation of the parameter even in the absence of dfss .",
    "moreover , we explain the connection between noisy quantum metrology and alignment - free quantum communication . in the end , we present three examples in order to further clarify different aspects of quantum metrology with imperfect frames of reference .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ qcr ] we briefly review some of the mathematical tools from quantum metrology , in particular quantum fisher information ( qfi ) and symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) . in section  [ afc ] we represent the general scheme of the alignment - free communication protocols . in section  [ qmqrf ]",
    "we present the general framework for quantum parameter estimation in the absence of an ideal crf and we discuss its relation to the alignment - free communication protocols . in section  [ ex ]",

    "[ do ] we discuss the results of this paper and we mention some of our research interests in quantum parameter estimation as possible future work .",
    "the main goal in quantum metrology is to estimate an unknown parameter @xmath1 of a completely positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) quantum channel , @xmath2 . in order to do so",
    ", first a probe state is prepared which is then fed into the channel of interest .",
    "finally a measurement on the final state of the probe will enable us to estimate @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is a physical quantity such as time , phase , temperature , acceleration , etc . given a measurement strategy , the conditional probability of obtaining outcome @xmath3 when the initial state is @xmath4",
    "is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are elements of a complete positive - operator valued measure ( povm ) corresponding to the chosen measurement strategy ( see fig.[qcrb ] ) .",
    "the lower bound on how precise we can estimate @xmath1 is given by the `` _ _ classical cramr - rao bound _ _ '' , i.e. @xmath7 , where the classical fisher information @xmath8 is defined as    @xmath9^{2},\\ ] ] and @xmath10 is the number of repeated measurements . in other words , classical fisher informations is an operational measure which tells us how much information we can gain about the unknown parameter @xmath1 by choosing a certain measurement strategy .",

    "then a measurement is performed on the final state of the system which makes it possible to extract information about the parameter of interest . ]",
    "braunstein and caves showed that optimisation over all the possible quantum measurements provides an even more stringent lower bound  @xcite , i.e. [ cramer - rao ] n()^2 , where @xmath11 is the quantum fisher information .",
    "this quantity is closely related to the symmetric logarithmic derivative @xmath12 which is defined by @xmath13 . in particular in the basis @xmath14 in which @xmath4 is diagonalised , i.e. @xmath15 , the sld and the qfi can be written as    @xmath16    @xmath17    with the relation @xmath18    the summations above do not include the terms with @xmath19 . the optimal povm which achieves the quantum cramr - rao bound , can be constructed from the eigenstates of @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "+ note that in this section the existence of ideal crfs was assumed .",
    "this treatment of reference frames can lead to great deal of confusion .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the role of an external phase reference frame in interferometric setups has been analysed . in this paper",
    "we analyse the decrease in quantum fisher information as a result of not having access to a perfect reference frame for the physical quantity @xmath1 . in particular , we present necessary and sufficient conditions for two extreme cases ; the case where the qfi does not decrease when a crf is lacking and the case where the qfi vanishes due to imperfectness of the rf , i.e. one can no longer extract the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , quantum parameter estimation can be phrased as a communication protocol between two parties . in this section",
    "we briefly review how qrfs have been employed in order to achieve alignment - free communication protocols  @xcite .",
    "+ consider @xmath21 to be the group element that describes the passive transformation from alice s to bob s reference frame .",
    "furthermore , since bob is completely unaware of the relation between his local rf and alice s local rf , we can assume that the group element @xmath22 is completely unknown .",

    "however , despite the fact that alice has no information about the group element @xmath22 that relates her local rf to bob s local rf , she can still encode information in the so called `` _ _ decoherence - free subsystems ( dfs ) _ _ ''  @xcite .",
    "these subsystems are resilient to the decoherence caused due to the lack of knowledge about the relative direction of the local reference frames .",
    "the efficiency of this protocol depends on the dimensionality of the largest dfs , i.e. the subsystem which possesses the largest number of degenerate eigenstates .",
    "such communication scenarios in the absence of a shared cartesian reference frame have been analysed before  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to encode logical qubits into rotationally invariant states of multiple physical qubits . in this case",
    "the number of logical qubits per number of physical qubits that can be transmitted scales as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of transmitted physical qubits .",
    "this remarkable result proves that in the limit of @xmath28 one logical qubit can be sent per one physical qubit . therefore in this limit",
    "the efficiency of this scheme is the same as the scenario wherein the reference frames are aligned .",
    "this protocol has also been studied for the situation in which the parties do not share a common background phase reference frame  @xcite .",
