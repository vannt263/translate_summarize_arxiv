    "the fib is based on a ga@xmath2 primary ion - beam with a 30 kv acceleration voltage .",
    "the ion - optic axis is at an angle of 54@xmath3 to the electron - optic axis .",
    "the standard vacuum levels for the electron - gun and the sample chamber are 10@xmath4 and 10@xmath5 mbar , respectively .",
    "the serial sectioning of the sample is achieved using fib and the images are acquired using the sem at specified milling intervals . + before the sem imaging of the sample , it must be ensured that the sem and fib images correspond to the same region - of - interest of the sample .",
    "this condition is obtained in the following way : firstly , we set the sample stage to the eucentric tilt position to avoid an offset in sample position with sample tilt .",
    "secondly , the co - incidence of the electron and ion beam has to be ensured .",
    "this is established by tilting the sample by 54@xmath3 with a constant working - distance of about 5 mm and adjusting the z - axis until the sem image of the sample comes into focus .",
    "a trench is cut into the sample in the vicinity of the region - of - interest with a relatively intense ion - beam current of 6.5 na such that the cross - sectional ( cs ) plane becomes visible .",

    "the total thickness of the cut is 10 m. in order to optimize the total duration of milling and image - acquisition , the sem images are obtained at every fifth fib - slice which results in 84 images representing slices of 0.12 m thickness .",
    "note , that ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) values of the voxel - size are related by the relation @xmath7 = @xmath6/sin(54 ) , where the value of @xmath6 is determined by the magnification of the image and the 54@xmath3 origin from the tilt of the sample .",

    "the phases are assigned manually .",
    "further details of the methodology of reconstruction is discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite .",

    "this step avoids systematic errors due to periodic boundary conditions which are used in the lbm simulations . the resulting geometry is subsequently coarsened in order to decrease the computational load .",
    "the dimensions of the samples are summarized in table [ tab : recon_strucdata ] . + as outlined above the hydrophobic binder material is important for the distribution of the liquid phase and , thus , performance of the device .",
    "unfortunately , the binder distribution is lost in the imaging and reconstruction process . in our reconstructions",
    "we distribute binder fibers by a random walk algorithm on the electrode surface .",
    "binder fibers crossing the void space between electrode particles are neglected .",
