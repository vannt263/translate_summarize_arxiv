    "non - abelian gauge theories , unphysical polarisation states are removed by the contributions from faddeev - popov ghosts  @xcite .",
    "it seems reasonable therefore to pursue means of directly calculating transition probabilities that bypass the amplitude level altogether , the hope being that such artefacts never appear explicitly .",
    "another ( not unrelated ) artefact of dealing with amplitudes , and one that we will focus on in this note , is apparent a - causal behaviour , i.e.  behaviour seemingly at odds with einstein causality and the forbiddance of faster - than - light signalling .",
    "the archetypal example of such a signalling process is the famous fermi two - atom problem  @xcite .",
    "fermi considered two point - like atoms , a and b , separated by a distance @xmath0 .",
    "atom a is initially prepared in an excited state , and atom b is initially prepared in its ground state .",
    "fermi calculated the probability that , after a time @xmath1 , atom a would be found in its ground state , and atom b would be found in an excited state , following the exchange of a photon .",
    "fermi claimed to prove that this probability is strictly zero for all times @xmath2 .",
    "fermi was in fact wrong , and one should expect a non - zero probability _ for all _ @xmath1 , since the simultaneous measurement of the states of atoms a and b does not constitute a local measurement .",
    "instead , we should ask for the probability that atom b is found in an excited state after a time @xmath1 without making any restriction on the states of atom a or the electromagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "( a recent introduction to the fermi problem and an overview of its history can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) as we will see , this local measurement is independent of the state of atom a for all times @xmath2 , therefore being manifestly causal in the weak sense ( see , e.g. ,  ref  @xcite ) .",
    "the local measurement described above is fully inclusive over the states of atom a and the electromagnetic field . as such",

    "it is perhaps even more disconcerting that the a - causal part of the feynman propagator actually corresponds to _ on - shell _ propagation , that is the part that we would normally associate with _ real _ particles .",

    "note that neither the retarded ( @xmath17 , @xmath15 ) nor advanced ( @xmath18 , @xmath15 ) pole prescriptions permit us to wick rotate , as we should expect . in the next section , we will show that the retarded and advanced propagators do in fact play this dominant role but only at the level of _ probabilities _ , and their presence will ensure that faster - than - light signalling is forbidden .",
    "moreover , we will see that they emerge through the interplay of time- and anti - time - ordered products of field operators .",
    "time - ordering of the two - point function corresponds to the feynman prescription ( @xmath19 ) , which places the positive- and negative - frequency poles in the second and fourth quadrants of the complex plane , respectively .",
    "instead , anti - time - ordering corresponds to the dyson prescription ( @xmath20 ) , which places the positive- and negative - frequency poles in the first and third quadrants , respectively .",
    "it is through combinations of terms involving these two prescriptions that both poles can appear in the lower - half complex plane to give the retarded propagator or the upper - half complex plane to give the advanced propagator .",

    "the manifest causality of local measurements persists .",

    "[ fig : fermi ] and [ fig : keyresult ] , we notice that the unobserved emissions necessarily accounted for in the amplitude - level calculation never appeared explicitly in the probability - level calculation .",
    "this can be traced back to the simple fact that , at the probability level , the effect operator corresponding to a fully inclusive measurement is just the unit operator , which trivially commutes with everything else , dropping out of the calculation entirely .",
    "the import of this observation is the following : by working directly with probabilities , we do not have to keep track of and calculate the individual amplitudes for all possible unobserved emissions in the final state .",
    "notwithstanding the potential implications of this for treating ir divergences , probability - level calculations allow us to introduce projection operators for ( semi-)inclusive measurements , which do not have simple analogues at the amplitude level  @xcite .",
    "as an example , the effect operator that sums inclusively over final - state radiation with momenta below some scale @xmath108 is @xmath109 the colons indicate normal ordering , and @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the usual scalar creation and annihilation operators . in the limit @xmath112 , the operator is fully inclusive over final - state radiation :    [ eq : fullinc ] @xmath113    where the appearance of the four - point amplitude is a consequence of the optical theorem . in the limit @xmath114 , the operator projects out the vacuum exclusively ( see , e.g. ,  ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    @xmath115    for finite @xmath108 , eq .   defines an operator form of the sudakov factor  @xcite .",
    "such an object could not be written down at the amplitude level .",
    "in this note , we have outlined a method for directly calculating transition probabilities in quantum field theory in terms of the expectation values of nested commutators and anti - commutators of field operators .",
    "these transition probabilities are manifestly causal and have the interesting feature that unobserved emissions are accounted for _ implicitly _ in ( semi-)inclusive measurements .",
    "the ability to sum implicitly over soft emissions may have important implications for how we deal with ir divergences in gauge theories , and this motivates the further development of technologies for evaluating these probabilities .",
    "such technology may , for instance , exploit the connection between causality and unitarity to which we have alluded , making use of the unitarity cutting rules of the closed - time - path formalism and building upon ideas presented in  ref .",
