    "_ ab - initio _",
    "( first - principles ) electronic structure calculations based on the density functional theory ( dft ) have been widely employed during the last decades to analyze the behavior of a constantly increasing number of alloys .",
    "the rapid development of computer resources available to scientists allowed to study systems with increasing complexity . in the meantime electronic structure calculations have served to predict new materials with novel properties susceptible of finding applications in modern nanotechnology which , very often , were grown using modern experimental techniques like molecular beam epitaxy or pulsed layered deposition .",
    "first - principles calculations cover a wide range of materials from metals and semiconductors to biological systems .",
    "also magnetic materials have been widely studied using such methods and their properties connected to the spin of the electrons , _",
    "e.g. _ spin moments , magnetic anisotropy energy , magnetooptical properties , etc , have been accurately represented .",
    "the drawback of first - principles electronic structures calculations stems from density functional theory which has been developed for zero temperature . for realistic",
    "applications temperature plays a crucial role since it greatly affects magnetic properties , _",
    "e.g. _ the magnetization of a material drops with temperature and vanishes at the curie temperature .",
    "thus it becomes more and more important to use the results of ab - initio calculations as the basis for developing complex methodologies to study the temperature effect on the electronic properties of materials . to study thermodynamics properties of magnetic materials the obtained zero temperature electronic structure results",
    "is usually mapped onto classical heisenberg hamiltonian , which can be solved by employing the methods of statistical physics @xcite .",
    "so far two methods have been widely used to calculate effective exchange interactions in magnetic materials within the adiabatic approximation : ( i ) the frozen - magnon approach , which is a reciprocal space method @xcite and ( ii ) the lichtenstein s real space method @xcite . the common ground of both approaches is that only the collective excitations , known as magnons , are taken into account .",
    "these excitations dominate the lower part of the excitation spectra and correspond to spin - waves which run through the materials and which are associated to the orientation of the spin moments . except magnons , in magnetic materials",
    "exist the so - called stoner excitations which are associated to excitations of single majority - spin electrons to unoccupied minority - spin states and thus are accompanied by the flip of the electrons spin @xcite . in most systems based on transition - metal atoms",
    "the contribution of the stoner excitations to the lower part of the excitation is weak due to the large exchange splitting of these atoms and in some cases like the half - metallic ferromagnets they are even separated by a large stoner gap from magnons @xcite ; as stoner gap is defined the energy difference between the highest occupied majority - spin state and the lowest unoccupied minority - spin state and thus corresponds to the lowest possible stoner excitation energy .",
    "as we mentioned above the lower part of the excitation spectra is dominated by the so - called magnons which involve collective excitations of the spin magnetic moments . in a simplified picture",
    "we can assume that the magnitude of the spin magnetic moments of the atoms does not change with respect to the zero kelvin value calculated using ab - initio electronic structure methods but as we raise temperature atomic spin moments change their orientation in such a way that the azimuthal angle can be described by a propagating plane wave characterized by a vector @xmath4 belonging in the brillouin zone .",
    "this is the so - called spin - wave or magnon .",
    "if the magnitude of * q * is small we can assume that the energy for the creation of the spin - wave is given by the relation @xmath5 and thus depends only on the magnitude of the wave vector and not its orientation in the brillouin zone ; this usually occurs around the @xmath6 point as we will show also later on when presenting the energy - dispersion of the spin waves .",
    "the constant @xmath7 is referred to as the `` spin - wave stiffness constant '' .",
    "typical values of @xmath7 for transition metals are about 300 - 600 mev@xmath8@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the ground - state electronic structure calculations are carried out using the augmented spherical waves method ( asw ) @xcite within the atomic  sphere approximation ( asa ) @xcite and the exchange  correlation potential is chosen in the generalized gradient approximation @xcite .",
    "the method of the calculation of the exchange constants within the frozen - magnon approximation has been already presented elsewhere @xcite . here , to make the paper reasonably self - contained a brief overview",
    "notice that since the magnetism is almost exclusively concentrated on the transition metal site in the compounds under study ( with the exception of copt@xmath2 ) , as confirmed also from our calculations presented in the next sections , the equations presented below are for systems with only one magnetic sublattice for reasons of simplicity .",
    "to calculate the interatomic exchange interactions we use the frozen - magnon technique @xcite and map the results of the calculation of the total energy of the helical magnetic configurations @xmath10 onto a classical heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an exchange interaction between two mn(x ) atoms and @xmath13 is the unit vector pointing in the direction of the magnetic moment at site @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the lattice vectors , @xmath16 is the wave vector of the helix and @xmath17 the polar angle giving the deviation of the moments from the @xmath18 axis . within the heisenberg model ( [ hamiltonian ] )",
    "the energy of the frozen - magnon configurations can be represented in the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 does not depend on * q * and @xmath21 is the fourier transform of the parameters of exchange interaction between pairs of magnetic atoms : @xmath22 calculating @xmath23 for a regular @xmath16-mesh in the brillouin zone of the crystal and performing back fourier transformation one gets exchange parameters @xmath24 between pairs of the magnetic atoms .    first , the curie temperature is estimated within the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "for the case of a material with one magnetic sublattice ( for the multi - sublattice case see refs .",
    "@xcite ) the equation is @xmath25 within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) the curie temperature is given by the relation @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 $ ] is the energy of spin - wave excitations , @xmath28 is the bohr magneton , @xmath29 is the number of @xmath4 points in the first brillouin zone , and @xmath30 is the atomic magnetic moment . within the rpa formalism",
    "as implemented in our method it is not possible to take into account multiple magnetic sublattices contrary to the implementation of mfa .",
    "finally we should note that mfa corresponds to an equal weighting of the low- and high - energy spin - wave excitations leading to an overestimation of the experimental curie temperature contrary to rpa where the lower - energy excitations make a larger contribution to the curie temperature leading to more realistic values @xcite .",
    "we have applied the frozen - magnon approximation to a variety of systems .",
    "the obtained curie temperatures were found to be in good agreement with available experimental data when the stoner gap was large enough so that magnons are well - separated from stoner excitations in the excitation spectra .",
    "such systems are the half - metallic ferro- , ferri- and antiferro - magnetic compounds where the majority - spin band is metallic and the minority - spin band is semiconducting .",
    "the gap at the fermi level in minority - spin band leads to a large value of the stoner gap .",
    "half - metallic systems where we have applied our method include the diluted magnetic semiconductors @xcite , ferromagnetic heusler alloys like nimnsb and co@xmath1mnsi @xcite , half - metallic antiferromagnets @xcite , transition metal pnictides and chalcogenides @xcite , and half - metallic sp - electron ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "moreover these results have served to study several other thermodynamics properties like the temperature dependance of the magnetization in half - metallic antiferromagnets @xcite or the thermal properties of the ni sublattice in nimnsb @xcite .",
    "local ferromagnets which have been studied include the mn - based semi and full heusler alloys like nimnsb and ni@xmath1mnga @xcite .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the mn @xmath31 states are strongly delocalized and hybridize with the @xmath31 and @xmath32 electrons of the neighboring transition - metal and sp atoms , respectively .",
    "the localization of the spin magnetic moment comes from the fact that minority - spin electrons are almost excluded from the mn site while almost all majority - spin states are occupied .",

    "alloys where coexist mn atoms with sp atoms and/or late transition metal atoms are susceptible of being local ferromagnets ; the majority - spin electronic band of mn atoms is almost completely filled while the charge at the minority - spin band is negligible and as a result minority - spin electrons are excluded from the mn site leading to a localization of the mn spin moment .",
    "local spin magnetic moments do not necessarily mean that mn @xmath31-electrons are localized and as shown by kbler _",

    "we will focus on compounds for which the experimental dispersion curve of the magnons for crystals is known and thus can be compared to our calculated results .",
    "we have chosen three heusler alloys crystallizing in the l2@xmath0 structure which consists of four interpenetrating fcc sublattices : cu@xmath1mnal which has been experimentally studied by tajima et al in 1977 @xcite , and ni@xmath1mnsn and pd@xmath1mnsn studied by noda and ishikawa in 1976 @xcite .",
    "we have also included in our study the cubic mnpt@xmath2 alloy studied by by paul and stirling in 1979 @xcite which crystallizes in the so - called l1@xmath1 structure .",
    "for the three heusler compounds we have used the experimental lattice constants and for mnpt@xmath2 the lattice constant given in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see table [ table1 ] for the values ) . for all calculations",
    "we have used a dense 30@xmath4330@xmath4330 grid in the brillouin zone to carry out the needed integrations in the reciprocal space .",
    "for all four compounds the spin magnetic moment is localized at the mn site as shown in table [ table1 ] and the other sites carry a negligible spin moment with respect to the mn atoms .",
    "the mn spin moment varies from 3.67 to 4.08 @xmath44 and the small variation is due to the effect of the local environment ( the degree of hybridization with the orbitals of the neighboring atoms ) .",
    "we do not present for the heusler alloys the atom - resolved and total density of states ( dos ) since it is similar to the ones in ref .",
    "relevant to our discussion is the mn - resolved dos , which varies little between the four compounds under study and in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we present the total and mn - resolved dos in mnpt@xmath2 . the mn majority - spin states are almost completely occupied while the minority states are completely empty ; there is a very small weight of minority - spin occupied states due to the influence of the neighboring pt atoms but this does not change the overall picture .",
    "although a real stoner gap does not exist as in half - metals , due to the _ sp - d _ mixing the majority - spin dos below the fermi level in the l2@xmath0-type compounds ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the minority - spin dos just above the fermi level in the l1@xmath1-type compounds ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) are almost negligible ; an exception occurs as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for copt@xmath2 which is not a local moment ferromagnet and substantial part of the co minority - spin states are occupied .",
    "therefore , the single - particle spin - flip stoner excitations for the local ferromagnets make a small contribution to the total excitation spectra at low energies , where collective spin - wave modes dominates . as a result , well defined spin waves exist throughout the brillouin zone with small damping as observed in experiments ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) , which also justifies the use of the frozen - magnon method in the calculation of the spin - wave dispersion and the exchange interactions .",
    "indeed , recent time - dependent dft calculation of spin - wave dispersion of cu@xmath1mnal gave very similar results to the one obtained from the adiabatic approximation , _",

    "[ fig1 ] we present the calculated spin - waves dispersion energy @xmath47 curves and we compare them with the available experimental data from refs @xcite employing the neutrons diffraction technique .",

    "@xcite reveals that as the temperature rises for the same @xmath4 experiments give a smaller @xmath47 value .",
    "overall the calculated dispersion curves follow the behavior of the experimental data with the minimum at the @xmath6 point . for the three heusler alloys our calculations give larger values of the dispersion energies @xmath47 , except close to the @xmath6 point where calculations accurately represent the experimental data . for mnpt@xmath2 calculated and experimental data fall one on top of the other except close to the r point , but this agreement is misleading since the experiment has been carried out at 80 k much higher than for cu@xmath1mnal .",
    "the good representation of the experimental data by the calculations can be traced at the spin - wave stiffness constants @xmath7 which are presented in table [ table2 ] .",
    "as we mentioned above the @xmath7 is the constant connecting the energy needed for the creation of the spin - wave when the magnitude of the wave - vector @xmath4 is small as it occurs around the @xmath6 point .",

    "]    from the spin - waves dispersion energies we can calculate the exchange constants describing the effective mn - mn exchange interactions as discussed in the previous section . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we present their values as a function of the distance between the mn atoms . in all compounds due to the large spatial separation ( @xmath3  ) of the magnetic transition metal atoms",
    "the 3__d _ _ states belonging to different atoms overlap weakly and as a consequence the exchange coupling is indirect , mediated by the _",
    "sp _ electrons . a very nice discussion on the exchange coupling in local moment ferromagnets cam be found in ref . @xcite . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the calculated effective exchange parameters are long range and show rkky - type oscillations .",
    "all compounds show tendency to ferromagnetism but the different behavior of the exchange constants as a function of the distance strongly influences the curie temperatures and thus the temperature behavior of the magnetization . in table",
    "[ table1 ] we have also gathered the curie temperature within both the mfa and rpa approaches together with the experimental values from refs @xcite . in mfa",
    "all magnons contribute equally to the curie temperature , while in rpa the magnons with the lower energy have a higher contribution as can be deduced by the equations in the previous section .",
    "thus rpa is expected to give a more accurate description of the curie temperature . for cu@xmath1mnal , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the coupling between mn nearest and next - nearest neighbors is strongly ferromagnetic reaching a value of 10 mev for nearest neighboring mn atoms and it almost vanishes for more distant mn atoms .",
    "thus the ferromagnetism in cu@xmath1mnal is extremely stable and the rpa calculated curie temperature is 635 k well above the room temperature and close to the experimental value of 603 k. the curie temperature calculated within mfa is more than 50%   larger than the rpa value . in both pd@xmath1mnsn and ni@xmath1mnsn the interactions between a mn atom and up to its third neighbors",
    "are positive while between the mn atoms fourth neighbors it is negative ; for further distance it is much smaller .",
    "note also that the scale in the vertical axis is different than cu@xmath1mnal and the maximum value is about 2 - 3 mev . since the number of fourth neighbors is large with respect to the closest neighbors , ferromagnetism in these two heusler compounds is not as robust as in cu@xmath1mnal and the curie temperature is close to the room temperature for ni@xmath1mnsn and below room temperature for pd@xmath1mnsn for which the antiferromagnetic interaction between mn atoms fourth neighbors is larger in magnitude .",
    "mnpt@xmath2 exhibits strong ferromagnetic coupling between mn atoms nearest neighbors while for mn second and third neighbors the coupling is same in magnitude but of opposite sign .",
    "thus the nearest neighbors interaction stabilizes ferromagnetic order with an experimental curie temperature around 390 k. note that for ni@xmath1mnsn , pd@xmath1mnsn and mnpt@xmath2 where the tendency to ferromagnetism is not as strong as for cu@xmath1mnal mfa gives values for the curie temperature closer to the experimental ones than pra although the latter one is in - principle more exact .",
    "this behavior is contrary to the behavior of the compounds regarding the spin - wave stiffness constants , since for the latter only the region around the @xmath6 point is important while for the calculation of the curie temperature we take into account the dispersion of the spin - wave energy in the whole brillouin zone .",
    "ferromagnets under study .",
    "positive dos values are assigned to the majority spin electrons and negative dos values to the minority spin electrons . ]",
    "in fig . [ fig3 ] we present the x - resolved and total dos for all compounds under study and in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the calculated exchange constants .",
    "in the lower part of table [ table1 ] we have gathered the lattice constants used for the calculations , the atom - resolved and total spin magnetic moments , the curie temperature within both mfa and rpa as well as the experimental curie temperature .",
    "we will start our discussion from the dos of the local moment ferromagnets ( x= v , cr and mn ) presented in fig .",
    "as we move from v to cr and then to mn the extra electrons occupy majority - spin states and the minority - spin states are above the fermi level .",
    "this is also reflected on the x - resolved spin magnetic moments in table [ table1 ] where from v to cr the transition - metal spin magnetic moment increases by @xmath481.3 @xmath44 and from cr to mn by about 1 @xmath44 .",
    "since the majority - spin states in vpt@xmath2 and crpt@xmath2 are not completely occupied these alloys should be classified as weak ferromagnets contrary to mnpt@xmath2 where all mn majority - spin states are occupied . in all three alloys",
    "the pt atoms have induced spin magnetic moments two orders of magnitude smaller than the x atoms and thus are not relevant for the discussion of the curie temperature . to make this point clear we have calculated for mnpt@xmath2 the curie temperature within mfa taking into account only the mn - mn interactions and all mn - mn , mn - pt and pt - pt interactions and the value changed from 406 k to 414 k and",
    "thus mn - mn interactions are the dominant ones and the pt sublattice can be neglected in the latter discussion .",
    "the mfa values for both vpt@xmath2 and crpt@xmath2 are much larger than the rpa ones by more than 100 k as expected form the discussion in section [ sec:2 ] .",
    "but as we move from mn to cr and then to v the discrepancy between the rpa values and the experimental ones increases .",
    "the difference should be traced in the experimental spin magnetic moments associated to these curie temperatures . in ref .",
    "@xcite vpt@xmath2 shows a curie temperature of 290 k and vanadium atoms a spin magnetic moment of about 1.0 @xmath44 ; both values are much smaller than our calculated values of 631 k and 1.56 @xmath44 . for crpt@xmath2(mnpt@xmath2 ) the experimental values in ref .",
    "@xcite are 494(390 ) k and 2.33(3.60 ) @xmath44 .",
    "thus as we move from v to mn the calculated spin magnetic moments come closer to the experimental values and so do the curie temperatures .",
    "the large discrepancy exhibited for v is a well - known problem of density - functional - theory - based calculations and can be traced also to other v - based compounds @xcite .",
    "regarding the exchange parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] v - v and cr - cr interactions present a similar picture with nearest and next - nearest neighbors being ferromagnetically coupled and the coupling is stronger for second than first neighboring transition metal atoms .",
    "for mnpt@xmath2 as we discussed in section [ sec:3 ] nearest neighbors present a strong ferromagnetic coupling while mn - mn next - nearest neighbors are antiferromagnetically coupled .",
    "alloys under study as a function of their distance .",
    "details as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . ]    in copt@xmath2 , like mnpt@xmath2 , all transition - metal majority - spin states are occupied but contrary to the latter alloy significant part of the co minority - spin states is also occupied and copt@xmath2 can not be classified as a local moment ferromagnet .",
    "the exchange splitting between the co majority- and minority - spin electronic bands is smaller than for mn in mnpt@xmath2 due to the extra electrons which fill also minority - spin states .",
    "moreover pt atoms carry now a significant induced spin magnetic moment of about 0.27 @xmath44 about one sixth of the co spin magnetic moment and thus both co - pt and pt - pt interactions are now important to calculate the temperature dependent properties .",
    "the co - co exchange constants presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] show a peculiar behavior since they are negative for nearest - neighbors , vanishing for next - nearest neighbors and positive for further neighbors .",
    "this behavior stems from the strong interplay between the ferromagnetic rkky and antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions @xcite and although finally copt@xmath2 is ferromagnetic the curie temperature is smaller than the room temperature .",
    "experiments in ref .",
    "@xcite give a value of 288 k while our rpa and mfa values taking into account only the co - co interactions are 130 k and 145 k respectively .",
    "however , the multi - sublattice mfa gives a value of 220 k considerably larger than the 145 k calculated taking into account only the co - co interactions .",
    "the multisublattice rpa is expected to give a t@xmath49 below 200 k. the discrepancy for copt@xmath2 should be attributed to the underestimation of the exchange interactions in the frozen - magnon method in the case of small magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "it is more likely that the co - pt exchange interactions are underestimated due to the small pt magnetic moments .",
    "combining first - principles electronic structure calculations and the frozen - magnon approximation we have studied the thermodynamic properties of two classes of local moment ferromagnets ( i ) the heusler alloys cu@xmath1mnal , ni@xmath1mnsn and pd@xmath1mnsn , and ( ii ) the cubic xpt@xmath2 compounds with x= v , cr and mn .",
    "the localization of the spin magnetic moment of the transition - metal atoms arises from the exclusion of the minority - spin electrons from these sites .",
    "we have also included in our study copt@xmath2 which is a usual ferromagnet .    in all compounds under study due to the large spatial separation ( @xmath3  ) of the magnetic transition metal atoms , the 3__d _",
    "_ states belonging to different atoms overlap weakly and as a consequence the exchange coupling is indirect , mediated by the _",
    "sp _ electrons . in the case of local ferromagnets",
    "a close look at the density of states ( dos ) revealed that due to the _ sp - d _ mixing either the majority - spin dos below the fermi level or the minority - spin dos just above the fermi level are almost negligible , and therefore , the single - particle spin - flip stoner excitations make a small contribution to the total excitation spectra at low energies , where collective spin - wave modes ( magnons ) dominate and the use of the frozen - magnon approximation in our calculations is justified .",
    "this reasoning is not applicable to copt@xmath2 where no localization of the spin magnetic moment occurs .",
    "the calculated effective exchange parameters are long range and show rkky - type oscillations .",
    "the curie temperature is estimated within both the mean - field and the random - phase approximations and our calculations show that when the spin magnetic moment is concentrated at the transition - metal atom only the exchange constants between these atoms determine the value of the curie temperature . in general ,",
    "the calculated curie temperatures , exchange constants and spin - wave dispersion curves are in fair agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "overall we can conclude that the main criterion for the application of the frozen - magnon approximation is either the large value of the stoner gap as in half - metallic ferromagnets ( see discussion in section [ sec:2 ] ) or a strong exchange splitting between the transition - metal majority- and minority - spin electronic bands as for the local moment ferromagnets under study in this article .",
    "deviations of the estimated curie temperature with respect to the experimental data occur when the ground - state electronic structure calculations overestimate the values of the spin magnetic moments as in vpt@xmath2 or when the exchange splitting is not strong enough as in the usual ferromagnet copt@xmath2 ."
