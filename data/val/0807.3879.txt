    "early work on language - based security , such as volpano and smith s type systems @xcite , precluded the use of high security variables to affect control flow . specifically , the conditions in if - commands and while - commands were restricted to using only low security information .",
    "if this restriction is weakened , it opens up the possibility that high security data may be leaked through the different timing behaviour of alternative control paths .",
    "this kind of leakage of information is said to form a _ covert timing channel _ and is a serious threat to the security of programs ( cf . e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we develop a new notion of security against timing attacks where the attacker is able to simultaneously observe the execution time of a ( probabilistic ) program and the probability of the values of low variables .",
    "this notion is a non - trivial extension of similar ideas for deterministic programs @xcite  which also covers attacks based on the combined observation of time and low variables .",
    "this earlier work presents an approach which , having identified a covert timing channel , provides a program transformation which neutralises the channel .",
    "we start by introducing a semantic model of timed probabilistic transition systems .",
    "our approach is based on modelling programs essentially as markov chains ( mc ) where the stochastic behaviour is determined by a joint distribution on both the values assigned to the program s variables and the time it takes the program to perform a given command .",
    "this is very different from other approaches in the area of automata theory which are also dealing with both time and probability . in this area",
    "the timed automata constitute a well - established model @xcite .",
    "these automata have been extended with probability and used in model - checking for the verification of probabilistic timed temporal logic properties of real - time systems @xcite .",
    "the resulting model is essentially a markov decision process where rewards are interpreted as time durations and is therefore quite different from our mc approach . in particular ,",
    "the presence of non - determinism makes it not very appropriate as a base of our quantitative analysis aiming at measuring timing leaks .",
    "we next present a concrete programming language with a timed probabilistic transition system as its execution model .",
    "this language is based on the language studied in @xcite  but is extended with a probabilistic choice construct  whilst this may not play a role in user programs , it has an essential role in our program transformation . in order to determine and quantify the security of systems and the effectiveness of potential counter - measures against timing attacks we then discuss an approximate notion of timed bisimilarity and construct an algorithm for computing a quantitative estimate of the vulnerability of a system against timing attacks ; this is given in terms of the mismatch between the actual transition probabilities and those of an ideal perfectly confined program .",
    "finally , we present a probabilistic variation of agat s padding algorithm which we use to illustrate  via an example  a technique for formally analysing the trade - off between security costs and protection .",
    "we introduce a general model for the semantics of programs where time and probability are explicitly introduced in order to keep track of both the probabilistic evolution of the program / system state and its running time .",
    "the scenario we have in mind is that of a multilevel security system and an attacker who can observe the system looking at the values of its public variables and the time it takes to perform a given operation or before terminating , or other similar properties related to its timing behaviour .    in order to keep the model simple , we assume that the time to execute a statement is constant and that there is no distinction between any ` local ' and ` global ' clocks . in a more realistic model ,",
    "one has  of course  to take into account also that the execution speed might differ depending on which other process is running on the same system and/or delays due to uncontrollable events in the communication infrastructure , i.e. network .",
    "our reference model is the timed probabilistic transition system we define below .",
    "the intuitive idea is that of a probabilistic transition system ( similar to those defined in all generality in @xcite ) where transition probabilities are defined by a joint distribution of two random variables representing the variable updates and time , respectively .",
    "let us consider a finite set @xmath0 , and let @xmath1 denote the set of all _ probability distributions _ on @xmath0 , that is the set of all functions @xmath2 $ ] , such that @xmath3 .",
    "we often represent these functions as sets of tuples @xmath4 .",
    "if the set @xmath0 is presented as a cartesian product , i.e. @xmath5 , then we refer to a distribution on @xmath0 also as a _ joint distribution _ on @xmath6 and @xmath7 . a joint distribution associates to each pair @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the probability @xmath10 .",
    "it is important to point out that , in general , it is not possible to define any joint distribution on @xmath11 as a ` product ' of distributions on @xmath6 and @xmath7 , i.e. for a given joint distribution @xmath12 on @xmath5 it is , in general , not possible to find distributions @xmath13 and @xmath14 on @xmath6 and @xmath7 such that for all @xmath15 we have @xmath16 . in the special cases where",
    "a joint distribution @xmath12 can be expressed in this way , as a ` product ' , we say that the distributions @xmath13 and @xmath14 are _ independent _ ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the execution model of programs which we will use in the following is that of a labelled transition system ; more precisely , we will consider probabilistic transition systems ( pts ) .",
    "we will put labels on transitions as well as states ; the former will have `` times '' associated with them while the latter will be labelled by uninterpreted entities which are intended to represent the values of ( low security ) variables , i.e. the computational state during the execution of a program .",
    "we will not specify what kind of `` time labels '' we use  e.g. whether we have a discrete or continuous time model  we just assume that time labels are taken from a finite set @xmath17 of positive real numbers .",
    "the `` state labels '' will be taken from an abstract set which we denote by @xmath18 .",
    "[ tpts ] we define a _ timed probabilistic transition system with labelled states _ , or tpts , as a triple @xmath19 , with @xmath20 a finite set of _ states _ , @xmath21 \\times s$ ] a probabilistic transition relation , and @xmath22 a state labelling function .      1 .   for all @xmath35 we have @xmath36 , and 2 .   for all @xmath37",
    "there is _ at most one _ tuple @xmath38 .",
    "if for all @xmath45 there exists at most one @xmath46 , we can also represent a timed probabilistic transition system with labelled states as a quadruple @xmath47 with @xmath48 \\times \\t$ ] , a timing function .",
    "thus , to any two states @xmath28 and @xmath29 we associate a unique transition time @xmath49 and probability @xmath50 .",
    "we associate , in the obvious way , to an execution sequence @xmath56 three more sequences : ( i ) the transition probability sequence : @xmath57 , ( ii ) a time stamp sequence : @xmath58 , and ( iii ) a state label sequence : @xmath59 .",
    "even for a tpts with a finite number of states it is possible to have infinite execution sequences .",
    "it is thus , in general , necessary to consider measure theoretic notions in order to define a mathematically sound model for the possible behaviours of a tpts .",
    "however , as long as we consider only terminating systems , i.e. finite traces , things are somewhat simpler .",
    "in particular , in this case , probability distributions can replace measures as they are equivalent . in this paper",
    "we restrict our attention to terminating traces and probability distributions .",
    "this allows us to define for every finite execution sequence @xmath60 its _ running time _ as @xmath61 , and its _ execution probability _ as @xmath62 .",
    "we will also associate to every state @xmath52 its _ execution tree _ ,",
    "i.e. the collection of all execution sequences starting in @xmath52 .      in section  [ pwhile",
    "]  we will present an operational semantics of a simple imperative programming language , pwhile , via a tpts .",
    "based on this model we will then investigate the vulnerability against attackers who are able to observe ( i ) the time , and ( ii ) the state labels , i.e. the low variables . in this setting",
    "we will argue that the combined observation of time and low variables is more powerful than the observation of time and low variables separately .",
    "the following example aims to illustrate this aspect which comes from the properties of joint probability distributions .    in order to illustrate the role of joint distributions in the observation of timed pts",
    "s let us consider the following simple systems .",

    "we assume that the states depicted as @xmath64 and @xmath65 form two classes which the attacker can identify ( e.g. because @xmath64 and @xmath65 states have the same values for low , variables ) .",
    "the question now is whether this information allows the attacker to distinguish the two tpts s .",
    "if we consider the information obtained by observing the running time , we see that both systems exhibit the same time behaviour corresponding to the distribution @xmath66 over @xmath67 .",
    "the same is true in the case where the information is obtained by inspecting the final states : we have the distributions @xmath68 over @xmath69 for both systems .",
    "however , considering that the attacker can observe running time and labels simultaneously , we see that the system on the right hand side always runs for @xmath70 time steps iff it ends up in a @xmath64 state and @xmath34 time step iff it ends up in a @xmath65 state . in the system on the left hand side",
    "there is no such _ correlation _ between running time and final state .",
    "the difference between the two systems , which allows an attacker to distinguish them , is reflected in the joint distributions over @xmath71 .",
    "these can be expressed in matrix form for the two systems above as : @xmath72 note that while @xmath73 is the product of two _ independent _ probability distributions on @xmath74 and @xmath18 it is not possible to represent @xmath75 in the same way .",
    "we consider a language similar to that used in @xcite  with the addition of a probabilistic choice construct .",
    "the syntax of the language is as follows : @xmath76 the probabilistic choice is used in an essential way in the program transformation presented later .",
    "we also keep the language of types in @xcite , although in a simplified form : @xmath77 and sub - typing relation : @xmath78    we will indicate by @xmath79 the state of a computation and denote by @xmath80 its restriction to low variables , i.e. a state which is defined as @xmath79 for all the low variables for which @xmath79 is defined , and is undefined otherwise .",
    "we say that two configurations @xmath81 and @xmath82 are _ low equivalent _ if and only if @xmath83 and we indicate this by @xmath84 .",
    "in the following we will sometimes use for configurations the shorthand notation @xmath85 .",
    "we will also denote by @xmath86 the set of all configurations .",
    "the operational semantics of pwhile  except for the probabilistic choice construct",
    " follows essentially the one presented in @xcite . for the convenience of the reader we present here all the rules which are based on the big step semantics for expressions ( where @xmath87\\!]}$ ] represents the usual semantics of operators ) :",
    "@xmath88\\ ! ] } v_2 } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    the small step semantics is then define as a timed pts via the sos rules in table  [ opsem ] .    ' '' ''      ' '' ''    the time labels @xmath90 represent the time it takes to perform certain operations : @xmath91 is the time to store a variable , @xmath92 is the time it takes to evaluate an expression , @xmath93 represents the time to perform an assignment , @xmath94 is the time required for a branching step , and @xmath95 is the time to perform a probabilistic choice . by @xmath96",
    "we denote any sequence of time labels and with @xmath97 we indicate termination .    the rule ( choose ) is the only new rule with respect to the original semantics in @xcite .",
    "it states that the execution of a probabilistic choice construct leads , after a time @xmath95 , to a state where either the command @xmath98 or the command @xmath99 is executed with probability @xmath100 or @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "this rule together with the standard transition rules for the other constructs of the language define a tpts for our pwhile language according to definition  [ tpts ] . in this tpts ,",
    "the state labels are given by the environment , i.e. @xmath102 .",
    "according to the notion of security we consider in this paper , an observer or attacker can only observe the changes in low variables .",
    "therefore , we can simplify the semantics by ` collapsing ' the execution tree in such a way that execution steps during which the value of all low variables is unchanged are combined into one single step .",
    "we call an execution sequence @xmath103 _ deterministic _ if @xmath104 , and we call it _ low stable _ if @xmath105 for all @xmath106",
    ". the empty path ( of length zero ) is by definition deterministic and low stable .",
    "an execution sequence is _ maximal deterministic / low stable _ if it is not a proper sub - sequence of another deterministic / low stable path .",
    "observing the low variables and the running time separately is not the same as observing them together ; a correlation between the two random variables ( probability and time ) has to be taken into account ( cf .",
    "section  [ model ] ) . a naive probabilistic extension of the @xmath118-bisimulation notion introduced in @xcite might not take this into account .",
    "more precisely , this may happen if time and probability are treated as two independent aspects which are observed separately in a mutual exclusive way .",
    "according to such a notion an attacker must set up two different covert channels if she wants to exploit possible interference through both the probabilistic and the timing behaviour of the system .    the notion of bisimulation",
    "we introduce here allows us to define a stronger security condition : an attacker must be able to distinguish the probabilities that two programs compute a given result in a given execution time .",
    "this is obviously different from being able to distinguish the probability distributions of the results _ and _ the running time .",
    "probabilistic bisimulation was first introduced in @xcite  and refers to an equivalence on probability distributions over the states of the processes .",
    "this latter equivalence is defined as a lifting of the bisimulation relation on the support sets of the distributions , namely the states themselves .",
    "an equivalence relation @xmath119 on @xmath20 can be lifted to a relation @xmath120 between probability distributions on @xmath20 via ( cf ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm  1 ) ) : @xmath121 \\in { { s}/_{\\sim } } : \\mu([s ] ) = \\nu([s]).\\ ] ] it follows that @xmath122 is also an equivalence relation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm  3 ) ) .    for any equivalence relation @xmath123 on the set @xmath86 of configurations ,",
    "we define the associated _ low equivalence _ relation @xmath124 by @xmath125 if @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "obviously @xmath124 is again an equivalence relation .",
    "we can lift a low equivalence @xmath124 to @xmath128 which we simply denote by @xmath129 .    given a security typing @xmath130 ,",
    "a probabilistic time bisimilarity @xmath123 is the largest symmetric relation on configurations such that whenever @xmath126 , then @xmath131    we say that two configurations are probabilistic time bisimilar or pt - bisimilar , @xmath126 , if there exists a probabilistic time bisimilarity relation in which they are related .",
    "this definition generalises the one in @xcite  which only applies to deterministic transition systems .",
    "note that there is a difference between @xmath132 and @xmath133 ; in fact , only the former is able to take into account the correlation between time and low variables , while the latter would be a straightforward generalisation of the time bisimulation in @xcite which is unable to model such a correlation .",
    "we now exploit the notion of bisimilarity introduced above in order to introduce a security property ensuring that a system is confined against any combined attacks based on both timing and probabilistic covert channels .",
    "a pwhile program @xmath134 is _ probabilistic time secure _ or pt - secure if for any set of initial states @xmath79 and @xmath135 such that @xmath136 , we have @xmath137 .",
    "the papers @xcite  introduce an approximate version of bisimulation and confinement where the approximation can be used as a measure @xmath138 for the information leakage of the system under analysis .",
    "the quantity @xmath138 is formally defined in terms of the norm of a linear operator representing the partition induced by the ` minimal ' bisimulation on the set of the states of a given system , i.e. the one minimising the observational difference between the system s components .",
    "we show here how to compute a non - trivial upper bound @xmath139 to @xmath138 by essentially exploiting the algorithmic solution proposed by paige and tarjan @xcite  for computing bisimulation equivalence .",
    "this was already adapted to pts s in @xcite , where it was used for constructing a padding algorithm as part of a transformational approach to the timing leaks problem . in this approach",
    "the computational paths of a program are transformed so as to make it perfectly secure by eliminating any possible timing covert channel while preserving its i / o behaviour .",
    "the algorithm we present here is an instantiation of that algorithm where the abstract labels are replaced by the statements in a concrete language ( pwhile ) and their execution times .",
    "moreover , instead of transforming the execution trees , our algorithm accumulates the information about the difference between their transition probabilities and uses this information to compute an upper bound @xmath139 to the maximal information leakage of the given program .",
    "@xmath140 execution tree with states @xmath141 , and @xmath142 execution tree with states @xmath143 @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 @xmath147 choose @xmath148 , @xmath149 @xmath150 @xmath151 , @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154 @xmath139    choose @xmath155 , @xmath156 for all @xmath157 @xmath158 @xmath159 choose @xmath160 , @xmath161 for all @xmath162 @xmath163 find best match @xmath164    algorithm  [ compdelta ]  describes a procedure that can be used inside an algorithm for constructing a lumping ( i.e.  a pt - bisimulation equivalence ) of two tpts s @xmath140 and @xmath142 . in particular , algorithm  [ qlumping ]  refers to a such a procedure which follows the algorithmic paradigm for partition refinement introduced by paige and tarjan in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the paige - tarjan algorithm constructs a partition of a state space @xmath165 which is _ stable _ for a given transition relation @xmath166 .",
    "it is a well - known result that this partition corresponds to a bisimulation equivalence on the transition system @xmath167 .",
    "the refinement procedure used in the algorithm consists in _ splitting _ the blocks in a given partition @xmath134 by replacing each block @xmath168 with @xmath169 and @xmath170 , where @xmath171 and @xmath172 .    in order to check whether two execution trees @xmath140 and @xmath142 in our tpts model are pt - bisimilar , in algorithm  [ qlumping ]",
    "we apply this refinement technique to the set of states formed by the disjoint union of the states in @xmath140 and @xmath142 .",
    "the strategy of our lumping procedure @xmath173  is as follows : it proceeds iteratively layer by layer starting from the leaves layer , and splits the blocks in the current partition restricted to the current layer . the procedure @xmath153 computes for each two layers @xmath174 and @xmath175 , the maximal difference @xmath176 between the probabilities to get from states in @xmath177 and @xmath178 , respectively , into states of layer @xmath175 . in the original lumping procedure",
    "this would determine a splitting of the states in layer @xmath174 .",
    "this value is stored in a variable @xmath179 and compared with the current value of a variable @xmath139 which contains the maximal difference up to that iteration .",
    "when the lumping algorithm terminates ( that is when we have reached the root of the union tree ) , one of the following situations will occur : either the roots of @xmath140 and @xmath142 belong to the same class in the constructed partition ( i.e. @xmath140 and @xmath142 are pt - bisimilar ) or not . in the latter case @xmath139 will contain a maximal difference in the transition probabilities of the two processes which makes them non - bisimilar .",
    "this is therefore an estimate of the information leakage of the system .",
    "note that , by construction , @xmath139 will be zero in the first case .",
    "the strategy for constructing the lumping described above determines the _ coarsest partition _ of a set which is stable wrt a given relation @xcite , that is in our case the coarsest pt - bisimulation equivalence .",
    "obviously , this does not necessarily coincide with the ` minimal ' one corresponding to the quantity @xmath138 defined in @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath139 will be in general only a safe approximation , namely an upper bound to the capacity of probabilistic timing covert channel defined by @xmath138 .",
    "the following proposition is therefore a corollary of proposition  45 in @xcite  stating a similar assertion for @xmath138-bisimulation .",
    "@xmath134 is pt - secure iff for any pair of initial configurations @xmath180 the corresponding execution trees @xmath140 and @xmath142 are such that @xmath181 returns @xmath182 .      the actual value of @xmath184 is determined by the way we compute the best match between the joint probability distributions @xmath185 and @xmath186 in line  8 of @xmath153 . in order to compute @xmath184 we use the _ supremum norm _",
    ", @xmath187 , between two distributions , i.e. the largest absolute difference between corresponding entries in @xmath185 and @xmath186 , respectively .",
    "in other words , we try to identify a class of states @xmath98 ( in the layer below ) and a time interval @xmath188 such that the probability of reaching this class in that time from @xmath28 differs maximally from the one for @xmath29 .",
    "one can argue that this is a fair approach as we treat all classes and time labels the same way .",
    "however , it might be useful to develop a measure which reflects the fact that certain times and classes are more similar than others .    from the point of view of the attacker , such a measure would encode her / his ability in detecting similarity as given by the nature and the precision of the instruments he is actually using .",
    "for example , suppose it is possible to reach the same class @xmath98 from @xmath28 and @xmath29 with different times @xmath32 and @xmath33 , such that the corresponding probabilities determine @xmath184 ( i.e. we have the maximal difference in this case ) .",
    "however , we might in certain circumstances also want to express the fact that @xmath32 and @xmath33 are more or less similar , e.g. for @xmath189 and @xmath190 we might want a smaller @xmath191 than for @xmath192 and @xmath193 . in terms of the attacker",
    ", this means that we make our estimate dependent on the actual power of the time detection instrument that he / she possesses .    in order to incorporate similarity of times and/or classes",
    "we need to modify the way we determine the best match in line  8 of @xmath153 . instead of determining the norm between @xmath185 and @xmath186 we can compute a weighted version as : @xmath194 where @xmath195 re - scales the entries in @xmath185 and @xmath186 so as to reflect the relative importance of certain times and/or classes . note that `` @xmath196 '' denotes here the component - wise and not the matrix multiplication : @xmath197 . if , for example , an attacker is not able to detect the absolute difference between times but can only measure multiplicities expressing approximative proportions , we could re - scale the @xmath198 s via @xmath199 .    in the following",
    "we will use a weighted version @xmath191 which reflects the similarity of classes .",
    "the idea is to weight according to the `` replaceability '' of a class . to this purpose",
    "we associate to every class ( in the layers below ) a matching measure @xmath200 , i.e. we determine the @xmath191 between a ( sub)tree with a root in the class @xmath98 in question and all ( sub)trees with roots in any of the other classes @xmath201 .",
    "we can take any representative of the classes @xmath98 and @xmath201 as these are by definition bisimilar .",
    "the measure @xmath202 indicates how easy it is to replace class @xmath98 by another one , or how good / precise is the attacker in distinguishing successor states .",
    "then @xmath191 is simply the weighted version of @xmath184 as described above with @xmath203 .",
    "note that there is no problem with the fact that @xmath191 is defined recursively as we always know the @xmath191 in the layers below before we compute @xmath191 in the current layer .",
    "if we compute the @xmath184 and @xmath191 values between all the pairs of systems we get the following results : @xmath206 from this we see that @xmath184 and @xmath191 are symmetric , i.e. the difference between two systems is symmetric ; that every system is bisimilar with itself , i.e. @xmath207 ( as we have an empty diagonal ) ; and that the difference between two systems is between zero and one with values in between very well possible .",
    "in a recent article on `` software bugtraps '' in _ the economist _ the authors report on some ongoing research at nist on `` software assurance metrics and tool evaluation '' @xcite .",
    "they claim that `` _ the purpose of the research is to get away from the feeling that ` all software has bugs ' and say ` it will cost this much money to make software of this kind of quality ' _ '' .",
    "they then conclude : `` _ rather than trying to stamp out bugs altogether , in short , the future of `` software that makes software better '' may lie in working out where the pesticide can be most cost - effectively applied _ '' .",
    "our aim is to introduce `` cost factors '' in a similar way into computer security . instead of trying to achieve perfect security we will look at the trade - off between costs of security counter measures  such as increased average running time  and the improvement in terms of security , which we can measure via",
    "the @xmath139 introduced above . even in simple examples we are able to exhibit interesting effects .      in @xcite",
    "agat introduces a program transformation to remove covert timing channels ( _ timing leaks _ ) from programs written in a sequential imperative programming language .",
    "the language used is a language of security types with two security levels that is based on earlier work by volpano and smith @xcite .",
    "whilst volpano and smith restrict the condition in both while - loops and if - commands to being of the lowest security level , agat allows the condition in an if - command to be high security providing that an external observer can not detect which branch was taken .",
    "he shows that if a program is typeable in his system , then it is secure against timing attacks .",
    "this result depends critically on a notion of bisimulation ; an if - command with a high security condition is only typeable if the two branches are bisimilar .",
    "agat s notion of bisimilarity is timing aware and based on a notion of low - equivalence which ensures stepwise non - interference .",
    "he does not give an algorithm for bisimulation checking .",
    "if a program fails to type , agat presents a transformation system to remove the timing leak .",
    "the transformation pads the branches of if - commands with high security conditions with dummy commands .",
    "the objective of the padding is that both branches end up with the same timing and thus become indistinguishable by an external observer .",
    "the transformation utilises the concept of a _ low - slice _ : for a given command @xmath98 , its low - slice @xmath208 has the same syntactic structure as @xmath98 but only has assignments to low security variables ; all assignments to high security variables and branching on high security conditions are replaced by skip commands of appropriate duration .",
    "the transformation involves extending the branches in a high security if - command by adding the low - slice from the other branch .",
    "the effect of this transformation is that the timing of the execution of both branches are the same and equal to the sum of timing of the two branches in the untransformed program .",
    "agat demonstrates that the transformation is semantically sound and that transformed programs are secure ( correctness ) .    in order to extend this system to our language",
    ", we only have to add a rule for the * choose * statement ( essentially a straight forward extension of the rule for * if * ) . in detail",
    ", we present the typing rules in table  [ sectypes ] . note that the rule ( if@xmath209 ) refers to the _ semantic _",
    "notion of timed bisimilarity ( as introduced in section  [ ptbisim ] ) .    ' '' ''      ' '' ''      we consider a probabilistic variant of agat s language .",
    "probabilities play an important role in the transformation . rather than just adding the low slice from the other branch to each branch of a high security conditional",
    ", we transform each branch to make a probabilistic choice between its padded and untransformed variant .",
    "this allows us to trade - off the increased run - time of the padded program versus the vulnerability to attack of the untransformed program .",
    "the transformation described is just one on a whole spectrum of probabilistic transformations  at the other extreme we could probabilistically decide whether or not to execute each command in the low slice .",
    "all the formal transformation rules for probabilistic padding are the same as in @xcite .",
    "the only exception is the rule ( if@xmath209 ) : here we replace  provided certain typing conditions are fulfilled  the branches of an * if * statement not just by the correctly `` padded '' version as in @xcite ; instead we introduce in every branch a choice such that the secure replacement will be executed only with probability @xmath100 while with probability @xmath101 the original code fragment will be executed .    in order to transform programs into secure versions we need to introduce an auxiliary notion , namely the notion of global effect @xmath211 of commands",
    "this is used to identify ( global ) variables which might be changed when a command @xmath98 is executed .",
    "here is its formal definition : @xmath212    the judgments or transformation rules in table  [ progtrans ]  are of the general form : @xmath213 which represents the fact that with a certain ( security ) typing @xmath118 we can transform the statement @xmath98 into @xmath99  we also recorder as a side - product the so - called _ low slice _",
    "@xmath214 of @xmath99 .    ' '' ''      ' '' ''      our probabilistic version of agat s padding algorithm allows us to obtain _ partially _ fixed programs . depending on the parameter @xmath100 with which we introduce empty low slices to obfuscate the timing leaks we can determine the ( average ) execution time of the fixed program in comparison with the improvement in security .",
    "agat presents in his paper @xcite  an example which itself is based on kocher s study @xcite  of timing attacks against the rsa algorithm . in order to illustrate our approach we simplify the example slightly : the insecure program agat we start with is depicted on the left side in table  [ agatprogs ] .",
    "the fully padded version agat s algorithm produces , fagat , is on the right hand side of table  [ agatprogs ]  ( to keep things simple we omit agat s empty statements like skipasn s s ; as skip as well as s:=s can be used just to ` spend time ' without having any real effect on the store we can use e.g. s:=s in place of agat s skipasn s s ) .",
    "the program , pagat , presented in the middle of table  [ agatprogs ]  is the result of _ probabilistic padding _ :",
    "the original program agat is transformed in such a way that the compensating statements , i.e. low slices , are executed only with probability @xmath100 while with probability @xmath216 the original code is executed .",
    "for @xmath217 we have the same behaviour as the original program agat while for @xmath218 this program behaves in the same way as agat s fully padded version fagat .    ' '' ''    .... i : = 1 ; while i<=3 do   if k[i]==1 then     s : = s ;     else      skip ;   fi ;   i : = i+1 ; od ; ....       .... i : = 1 ; while i<=3 do   if k[i]==1 then     choose p : s : = s ; skip      or      q : s : = s      ro    else      choose p : skip     or      q : s : = s ; skip     ro   fi ;   i : = i+1 ; od ; ....       .... i : = 1 ; while i<=3 do   if k[i]==1 then     s : = s ; skip    else      s : = s ; skip   fi ;    i : = i+1 ; od ; ....    ' '' ''    in our concrete experiments we used the following assumptions .",
    "the variable @xmath219 can take values in @xmath220 while @xmath221 is a three dimensional array with values in @xmath222  nothing is concretely assumed about @xmath223 .",
    "the variables @xmath221 , representing a _ secret key _ , and @xmath223 have security typing @xmath224 , while @xmath219 is the only low variable which can be observed by an attacker .",
    "we implemented this example using ( arbitrary ) execution times : @xmath225 ( assign time ) , @xmath226 ( test / branch time ) , and @xmath227 ( skip time ) , and @xmath228 ( choice time ) .    the abstract semantics for the pagat program  which only records choice points and the moments in time when the low variable changes its value  produces the following execution trees if we start with keys k=011 and k=010 : @xmath229_{1:5 } &      \\bullet \\ar@/^/@2[r]^{q:4 }               \\ar@/_/@2[r]_{p:7 } &      \\bullet \\ar@2[r]_{1:2 } &      \\bullet \\ar@/^/@2[r]^{q:6 }               \\ar@/_/@2[r]_{p:7 } &      \\bullet \\ar@2[r]_{1:2 } &      \\bullet \\ar@/^/@2[r]^{q:6 }               \\ar@/_/@2[r]_{p:7 } &      \\bullet \\ar@2[r]_{1:1 } &      \\bullet    } \\ ] ] @xmath229_{1:5 } &      \\bullet \\ar@/^/@2[r]^{q:4 }               \\ar@/_/@2[r]_{p:7 } &      \\bullet \\ar@2[r]_{1:2 } &      \\bullet \\ar@/^/@2[r]^{q:6 }               \\ar@/_/@2[r]_{p:7 } &      \\bullet \\ar@2[r]_{1:2 } &      \\bullet \\ar@/^/@2[r]^{q:4 }               \\ar@/_/@2[r]_{p:7 } &      \\bullet \\ar@2[r]_{1:1 } &      \\bullet    } \\ ] ] one can easily see from this how probabilistic padding influences the behaviour of a program : for every bit in the key @xmath221  i.e. every iteration  we have a choice between executing the original code with probability @xmath216 or the ` safe ' code with probability @xmath100 .",
    "the new code always takes the same time ( in our case @xmath230 ticks ) while the original code s execution time depends on whether @xmath231}$ ] is set or not ( either @xmath232 or @xmath233 time steps in our case ) .",
    "clearly , for @xmath217 we get in every iteration a different execution time , depending on the bit @xmath231}$ ] , and thus can deduce the secrete value @xmath221 by just observing the execution times",
    ". however , as the execution time is always the same for the replacement code , it is impossible to do the same for @xmath218 . for values of @xmath100 between @xmath234 and @xmath34 , the ( average ) execution times for @xmath231}=0 $ ] and @xmath231}=1 $ ] become more and more similar .",
    "this means in practical terms that the attacker has to spend more and more time ( i.e. repeated observations of the program ) in order to determine with high confidence the exact execution time and thus deduce the value of @xmath231}$ ] ( cf .",

    "the graph on the left in figure  [ agatgraphs ]  shows how the running time ( vertical axis ) increases in dependence of the padding probability @xmath100 ( horizontal axis ) for the eight execution trees we have to consider in this example , i.e. for @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath238 , etc .",
    "depending on the number of bits set in @xmath221 we get four different curves which show how , for example for @xmath239 the running time increases from @xmath240 time steps ( for @xmath217 , i.e. agat program ) to @xmath241 ( for @xmath218 , i.e. fagat program ) .",
    "we can employ the bisimilarity measures @xmath139 and @xmath183 in order to determine the security of the partially padded program .",
    "for this we compute using our algorithm @xmath242 and @xmath243 for all possible keys , i.e. @xmath244 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath245 for all values of @xmath246 and any pair of keys @xmath247 and @xmath248 with @xmath249 ; only for @xmath218 we get , as one would expect , @xmath250 for all key pairs .",
    "the weighted measure @xmath183 is more sensitive and we get for example for @xmath251 the following values when we compare @xmath247 and @xmath252 : @xmath253 the diagonal entries are , of course , all zero as every execution tree is bisimilar to itself .",
    "the other entries however are different from @xmath234 and @xmath34 and reflect the similarity between the two keys and thus the resulting execution trees .",
    "if we plot the development of @xmath183 as a function of @xmath100 we observe only three patterns as depicted in the right graph in figure  [ agatgraphs ] . in all three cases @xmath183 decreases from an original value @xmath34 to @xmath234 , but in different ways .    in analysing the trade - off between increased running time and security we need to define a _",
    "cost _ function .",
    "for example , one could be faced with a situation where a certain code fragment needs to be executed in a certain maximal time , i.e. there is a ( cost ) penalty if the execution takes longer than a certain number of micro - seconds . in our case",
    "we will consider a very simple cost function @xmath254 with @xmath255 and @xmath256 the average @xmath183 between all possible execution trees and @xmath188 the average running time .",

    "nevertheless , this example illustrates already nicely the non - linear nature of security cost optimisation : the optimal , i.e. minimal , cost is reached in this case for @xmath251 , i.e. keeping the cost of security counter measures in mind it is better to use a `` half - fixed '' program rather than a completely safe one .",
    "the idea of defining a secure system via the requirement that an attacker must be unable to observe different behaviours as a result of different secrets ",
    "i.e. the system `` operates in the same way '' whatever value a secret key has",
    " goes back at least to the seminal work of goguen and meseguer @xcite .",
    "this led in a number of settings to formalisations of security concepts such as `` non - interference '' via various notions of behavioural equivalencies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the perhaps most prominent of these equivalence notions , namely _ bisimilarity _ , plays an important role in the context of security of concurrent systems but also found application for sequential programs such as in agat s work ( as the interaction between system and attacker can be modelled as a parallel composition ) . in order to allow for a decision theoretic analysis of security counter - measures and associated efforts it appears to be desirable to introduce a `` quantitative '' notion of the underlying behavioural equivalence . in the case of _ bisimilarity",
    "_ a first step was the introduction of the notion of _ probabilistic bisimulation _ by larson and skou @xcite .",
    "however , this notion turns out to be still too strict and a number of researchers developed `` approximate '' versions ; among them we just name the approaches by desharnais et.al .",
    "@xcite  and van  breugel @xcite  and our work @xcite  ( an extensive bibliography on this issue can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "we based this current paper on the latter approach because it allows for an implementation of the semantics of pwhile via linear operators , i.e. matrices , and an efficient computation of @xmath184 and @xmath191 using standard software such as octave @xcite .",
    "further research will be needed in order to clarify the relation between our measures @xmath139 and existing notions of _ approximate bisimilarity _ mentioned above , e.g. the @xmath260 in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also would like to shed more light on the relationship between our notion and information theoretic concepts used in the work of , for example clark et.al .",
