    "ever since the first prediction of neutron stars ( ns ) by @xcite , ns have become a major test bed of various theories of dense matter and nuclear matter .",
    "the extreme high pressure and density achievable inside ns offers an ideal and unique environment to infer the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter from astronomical observations . on the other hand ,",
    "the possible existence of quark stars ( qs ) would provide a strong support to a new form of matter , namely , the quark matter @xcite .",
    "moreover , the size and the mass of qs could also cast light on the properties of quark matter . thus , extracting useful information and constraints about nuclear and particle physics from astronomical observations of compact stars like ns and qs has become an active direction in astrophysics .",
    "since the density in the core of a ns ( or qs ) can be several times the normal nuclear density , the eos there is rather uncertain .",
    "various physical phenomena including pion condensation , hyperon formation and deconfined quark matter have been considered by theoretical nuclear physicists and sophisticated techniques of many - body calculations have been developed to yield a bunch of eos intended for the description of the deep interior of compact stars .",
    "it is standard practice for astrophysicists to construct compact stars with these eos for nuclear matter and establish various relationships among different physical quantities which could be obtained from astronomical observations .",
    "motivated by the possibilities of constraining eos of nuclear matter and extracting physical parameters of compact stars as well , researchers in astrophysics and nuclear physics have been actively seeking for eos - dependent and eos - independent relationships by examining the physical characteristics of compact stars constructed with different eos ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for example , @xcite compared the structure of compact stars of various kinds and discovered several empirical relationships connecting different physical characteristics of a star , such as the mass , the radius , the moment of inertia , and the mass distribution function as well .",
    "such relationships can be applied to infer the physical attributes of a compact star , including its eos , from astronomical observations .",
    "the main objective of the present paper is to unveil the universality embedded in the pulsation frequencies of non - rotating compact stars and to exploit these findings to infer the physical characteristics of ns or qs ( e.g. , mass , radius , moment of inertia and eos ) from their oscillation spectra .",
    "the pulsations of compact stars are an interesting and popular topic in its own right , for gravitational waves ( gw ) can be generated in such processes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a seminal exposition of the topic ) .",
    "it is indisputable that the detection of gw would be a major milestone in general relativity and astrophysics .",
    "several earth - based gw interferometric detectors such as ligo , virgo , geo600 and tama300 have been operating .",
    "while the current detectors are still not sensitive enough to detect gw directly , interesting upper limits have been placed on either the gw strains or event rate for several potential astrophysical sources ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the results obtained from the latest science runs of ligo ) .",
    "owing to the energy carried away by gw , pulsations of compact stars are damped harmonic oscillations , which are analyzed in terms of quasi - normal modes ( qnm ) ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "each qnm is characterized by a complex eigenfrequency @xmath0 and has a time dependence @xmath1 , displaying exponential decay with a damping time @xmath2 .",
    "several attempts have been made to relate @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) to the mass @xmath6 and the radius @xmath7 of a compact star and some universal relationships which are , to certain degree of accuracy , eos - independent have been found @xcite .",
    "however , most of these relationships fail to describe qnm of qs , which are stiff and self - bound .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found an empirical relation approximately expressing the moment of inertia in terms of the mass and the radius .",
    "such a relationship is universal as long as the eos under consideration is not too soft ( e.g. , hyperon matter ) or too stiff ( e.g. , quark matter ) .",
    "they proposed to use the universality to estimate the radius of a compact star from its mass and moment of inertia , with the latter two quantities being measurable for double pulsar systems by considering the spin - orbit coupling effect in general relativity @xcite .    motivated by the discovery of @xcite , we propose here to investigate the correspondence between the qnm frequency ( both @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) of the ( fundamental ) f - mode oscillations , @xmath6 and the moment of inertia @xmath8 of compact stars .",
    "we show that there exist eos - independent universal relationships between them , namely equations ( [ lau_r ] ) and ( [ lau_i ] ) , which are accurate up to a few percent or better and work nicely for qs as well . based on equations ( [ lau_r ] ) and ( [ lau_i ] ) ,",
    "a feasible scheme is in turn established to determine the mass and the moment of inertia of a compact star once its f - mode frequency is found from gw observations . as the radius @xmath7 of a ns ( or qs ) is approximately expressible in terms of the mass and the moment of inertia , our scheme can also yield good estimate of the radius and hence imposing constraints on the eos @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 is a brief review on the the behavior of f - mode oscillations of compact stars @xcite and the universal relationships among the mass , the radius and the moment of inertia of compact stars @xcite . in section 3",
    "we introduce an accurate universal relation between the scaled frequency @xmath9 and the physical quantity @xmath10 . in section 4",
    "we establish a feasible and robust scheme to apply our findings reported in section 3 to invert the mass , the moment of inertia , and in turn the radius of a compact star if its f - mode gw signal is detected .",
    "we finally summarize our paper in section 5 with a brief discussion .",
    "unless otherwise noted , we adopt geometric units with @xmath11 throughout the whole paper , and use kilometers as the unit of lengths .",
    "as mentioned in section 1 , the oscillation modes of compact stars are damped due to the emission of gw .",
    "hence , they are called quasi - normal modes , which can be further divided into polar and axial classes in each angular momentum sector according to the property of relevant metric and fluid perturbations under inversion . for typical non - rotating compact stars ,",
    "the polar class includes ( fundamental ) f - mode , ( gravity ) g - mode , and ( pressure ) p - mode and ( spacetime ) w - mode , while for non - rotating perfect fluid stars the axial class contains only the w - modes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review on the property of these modes ) .",
    "the methods for evaluation of qnm of compact stars are well documented in several papers and reviews ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the study of qnm of compact stars has a long history dating back to the pioneering work of @xcite .",
    "it is by now well established that the study of gw mode spectra of compact stars could provide useful information about the internal structure of the stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "as it is expected that the direct detection of gw will be realized in the near future , different proposals have been put forward to determine the physical parameters ( e.g. , mass , radius and eos ) of a compact star from its gw spectra . in the present paper",
    "we focus our attention on an eos - independent universal behavior of the quadrupolar ( angular momentum index @xmath12 ) f - mode and show that such universality can lead to accurate determination of the mass and the moment of inertia of a compact star ( ns or qs ) . combining our results with equations ( [ haensel_uni ] ) , ( [ lat ] ) and ( [ haensel_qs ] ) , one can also find an approximate value of the radius .",
    "the reason why we place special emphasis on the f - mode is that the relatively low frequency ( @xmath13 khz ) of the f - mode makes it more promising to be detectable by gw detectors than other modes .",
    "for example , considering a compact star 10 kpc from us , @xcite estimated that the energy required in the f - mode in order to lead to a detection with signal - to - noise ratio of 10 by the ligo detector is @xmath14 .",
    "for comparison , in order to achieve the same signal - to - noise ratio , the energy in the p - mode ( w - mode ) must be @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the energy requirement is much relaxed for the advanced ligo detector and the same signal - to - noise ratio is achieved if the energy in the f - mode is @xmath17 . since the total energy released in violent astronomical events such as supernova explosions could be as much as @xmath18 in some optimistic estimates @xcite , it seems plausible that the f - mode qnm signal of a fiercely pulsating compact star inside our galaxy could be detected by future gw detectors , especially when the narrow - banding capability is available to enhance the sensitivity of the detectors in the high - frequency region at around 1 khz .",
    "there have been several attempts to search for an approximately eos - independent behavior of the f - mode @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite showed that the scaled frequency @xmath9 for the f - mode of realistic ns is essentially a universal function of the compactness @xmath19 , which can be approximated by the quadratic formulae : @xmath20 these two formulae are good approximation for most ns .",
    "however , the f - modes of qs do not follow equations ( [ leung1 ] ) and ( [ leung2 ] ) . instead , they are approximated better by another quadratic fit .",
    "the difference between the behaviors of the f - modes of ns and qs are expected because the density profile of a qs is nearly uniform , which is very different from that of a ns .    on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite discovered some empirical relationships relating @xmath8 and compactness @xmath19 . for ns",
    ", @xcite found that @xmath21 where the scaled moment of inertia @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite also proposed an alternative expression : @xmath24 which yields better agreement for ns with higher compactness .",
    "however , both equations ( [ haensel_uni ] ) and ( [ lat ] ) fail to describe the case of qs . instead , @xcite found another relationship for qs : @xmath25 the distinction between the behaviors of ns and qs is also expected and attributable to the difference in the stiffness between nuclear and quark matters .    assuming that both @xmath8 and @xmath6 are obtained from observations",
    ", @xcite further argued that the radius @xmath7 can be found by solving these equation .",
    "however , two remarks about this method are in order .",
    "first , for the ns case the data points corresponding to stars characterized by different eos are rather scattered and may deviate appreciably from equations ( [ haensel_uni ] ) and ( [ lat ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", the value of @xmath7 obtained in this way is subjected to uncertainties depending on the eos .",
    "second , additional information has to be gathered to distinguish between the data of qs and ns beforehand .",
    "regardless of these remarks , it is observed that for a fixed eos the scaled moment of inertia increases monotonically with the compactness , indicating a one - one correspondence between these two quantities . in the following discussion",
    "we shall consider the feasibility to replace the compactness used in equations ( [ leung1 ] ) and ( [ leung2 ] ) with the moment of inertia .",
    "it is interesting to note from the reviews sketched in sections 2 that both the scaled moment of inertia @xmath26 and scaled f - mode frequency @xmath9 are rather insensitive to eos and are , within certain accuracy , universal functions of compactness @xcite .",
    "such coincidence is interesting , reflecting the fact that compactness is a useful parameter characterizing a compact star .",
    "however , it is also noticed that the scaled f - mode frequencies ( or the scaled moments of inertia ) of ns and qs follow two different universal behaviors .",
    "the disparity in the universal behaviors of ns and qs is attributable to the difference in their density profiles .    in the present paper",
    "we propose to examine the possibility of using the moment of inertia as an independent parameter , instead of the compactness , to characterize the f - mode spectra and in turn to search for any universality underlying these spectra .",
    "the physical motivation of our proposal is that the moment of inertia carries richer information about the mass distribution inside a star , which certainly affects f - mode oscillations .",
    "hence , the relationship between the moment of inertia and the f - mode is likely to be more direct and less eos - dependent .",
    "besides , as mentioned in section 2 , for compact stars with a fixed eos , the moment of inertia bears a one - one correspondence with the compactness . to this end",
    ", we replace the compactness @xmath19 by another dimensionless factor @xmath27 , which is proportional to the compactness for stars with uniform densities and is termed as the effective compactness .    the scaled f - mode frequencies for various realistic ns and qs are plotted against the effective compactness @xmath28 in figure  [ fig : f_mode_real_i ] , where the f - mode qnm frequencies of the compact stars constructed with the following eos are shown :    .",
    "the solid lines in the lower and upper panels respectively represent the best quadratic fits in @xmath28 to @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , the solid line in the lower panel is given by equation  ( [ lau_r ] ) . ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "assuming that both @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the f - mode of a compact star have been obtained from gw observations , we can then solve the simultaneous equations ( [ lau_r ] ) and ( [ lau_i ] ) to determine the mass @xmath6 and the moment of inertia @xmath8 of the star .",
    "moreover , making use of equation  ( [ lat ] ) proposed by @xcite , we can estimate the radius @xmath7 with the input of @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "since all these three equations hold only approximately , the inferred values of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are expected to deviate from the exact values by @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . as shown in table  [ uni_quality ] ,",
    "percentage errors in @xmath3 and @xmath4 predicted by equations ( [ lau_r ] ) and ( [ lau_i ] ) are small and usually less than a few percent .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the percentage errors @xmath34 and @xmath35 are also small and such inversion scheme can lead to accurate determination of the mass and the moment of inertia of the star .    to validate the scheme outlined above and test its accuracy , we inferred @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 numerically from @xmath3 and @xmath4 for three categories of compact stars , namely ns considered in figure  [ fig : f_mode_real_i ] ( with au and apr1 eos ) , ns considered in @xcite ( with a , b and gm24 eos ) , and qs ( qs1 and qs2 ) .",
    "table  [ invert_exp ] shows the percentage errors in mass , radius and moment of inertia of our scheme for these stars . in general , the inversion scheme works",
    "very well for ns and all three physical quantities can be determined up to a few percent or better .",
    "our scheme also reproduces accurate values of @xmath6 and @xmath8 for qs .",
    "however , the inferred value of @xmath7 is less satisfactory ( @xmath36% ) .",
    "this is understandable as the empirical relation ( [ lat ] ) only works for ns , but not qs . if , however , there is other independent evidence ( e.g. , via the observed thermal x - ray emission ) suggesting that the star might be a qs , we could then use equation  ( [ haensel_qs ] ) proposed by @xcite to infer a better value of @xmath7 from @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "the percentage errors @xmath37 obtained in this way are enclosed by parentheses in table  [ invert_exp ] .",
    "we see that the percentage error in @xmath7 is decreased from about 10% to 1% level . in summary",
    ", we expect that the inversion scheme proposed in the present paper is applicable regardless of the nature of the compact star in consideration .",
    "in this paper we study the universality embedded in f - mode pulsations of compact stars and propose to use it to determine the physical parameters ( including mass , radius and moment of inertia ) of a compact star from which the f - mode gravitational wave signal is detected .",
    "we first establish a pair of empirical equations ( [ lau_r ] ) and ( [ lau_i ] ) that can predict the frequency and the damping rate of f - modes from @xmath6 and @xmath8 with good accuracy for both ns and qs .",
    "we then apply such discovery to develop an inversion scheme to infer the mass , radius and moment of inertia of a compact star from its f - mode .",
    "in particular , the scheme is shown to work well for both ns and qs .",
    "the universality discovered in the present paper takes moment of inertia into the consideration , replacing the role of radius used in previous attempts @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the radius of a star is sensitive to the low - density part of its eos , whereas f - mode frequencies are expected to be dominated by dynamical behavior in the high - density regime .",
    "it is therefore physically appealing to use moment of inertia , which measures global mass distribution , to study f - mode oscillations . as clearly shown in table  [ uni_quality ] , the replacement of @xmath7 with @xmath8 indeed leads to a much improved universal behavior . as it is arguable that the accuracy of the inversion scheme directly reflects the quality of the universal behavior upon which the scheme is based , the universality discovered in the present paper leads to an accurate inversion scheme .    finally , it is worthy of mentioning that the first gravitational - wave search sensitive to the f - modes has recently been carried out by the ligo detectors @xcite .",
    "while the current detectors have not yet detected gravitational waves directly , it is plausible that the advanced ligo detectors , which have a factor of 10 improvement on the sensitivity , might detect the f - mode gravitational wave signals from compact stars .",
    "the inversion scheme proposed in this work will provide a unifying way to infer the mass , radius and moment of inertia of both ns and qs accurately .",
    "of course in reality the situation is often complicated by the presence of magnetic field and rotation , in the future we shall consider the impacts of these factors on our proposal .",
