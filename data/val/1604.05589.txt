    "ever since becker s ( 1974 ) theory of marriage , economists have been interested in the factors that lead to a stable marriage .",
    "it was becker who introduced the term `` assortative mating '' , which relates to the factors each party seeks in the other :  men differing in physical capital , education or intelligence ( aside from their effects on wage rates ) , height , race , or many other traits will tend to marry women with like values of these traits \" @xcite .",
    "the study of assortative mating is crucial to understand the formation of households , which is essential for the development of child human capital ",
    "the basis for economic and social progress .",
    "there is a good deal of empirical evidence relating to becker s assortative mating hypothesis .",
    "positive spousal correlations have been found : ( a ) in anthropometric features @xcite , ( b ) in health an well - being @xcite , and ( c ) in smoking behaviour , see e.g. , @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on a trait that is of particular interest to economists : risk attitude .",
    "@xcite also used the repeated data on married couples within the german socio - economic panel to investigate spousal correlation in risk attitude .",
    "they applied the bivariate panel ordered probit model to the self - reported risk attitude data from this source , and they found that the individual - specific effects ( in the risk attitude equation ) for the two members of a married couple , are positively correlated .",
    "this was interpreted in terms of positive assortative mating on risk attitude : individuals seek partners with similar risk attitude . as stressed by @xcite , it is not obvious that spousal correlation in risk attitude will be positive .",
    "risk - sharing arguments would lead to the hypothesis of negative correlation , or  disassortative mating \" @xcite . and , after all , according to a very well - known maxim ,  opposites attract \" .    in this paper",
    "we delve deeper into the investigation of assortative mating on risk attitude , by applying the copula approach .",
    "the main advantage of the copula approach is that it can allow a wide range of flexible tail dependence and asymmetry between the two variables ( here male s and female s risk attitude ) under investigation .",
    "the normality assumption used by @xcite is mathematically convenient , but one of our points is that this assumption is not reasonable if there is some skewness in the joint tails .",
    "for example , could it be that risk - lovers are particularly keen to match with other risk - lovers ( positive tail dependence ) ?",
    "could it be that risk - avoiders are particularly keen to match with risk - lovers ( negative tail dependence )",
    "? such features of the dependence structure may be captured when the copula approach is used .",
    "we are particularly interested in whether and how this dependence structure changes with years of marriage .",
    "a very interesting hypothesis is that of socialization @xcite : a process by which attitudes become more similar with time .",
    "this hypothesis can be investigated by estimating the copula model separately for different stages of marriage .",
    "we will use a general copula construction , based on a set of bivariate copulas to jointly model bivariate ordinal time - series responses with covariates .",
    "we call this the  joint copula - based markov model \" . for the proposed model ,",
    "we construct the joint distribution in terms of three bivariate copulas . for each ordinal time series we consider a copula - based markov model , where a parametric copula family is used for the joint distribution of subsequent observations and",
    "then we relate these ordinal time - series responses using another copula to couple their conditional ( on the past ) distributions at each time point .",
    "much is known about properties of parametric bivariate copula families in terms of dependence and tail behavior . in this paper",
    "we draw on this wealth of knowledge .",
    "the discretized bivariate normal ( bvn ) model is a special case of our general construction when all the bivariate linking copulas are bvn",
    ". other choices of copulas are better if ( a ) @xmath0 s have more probability in joint upper or lower tail than would be expected with a discretized bvn , or ( b ) @xmath0 s can be considered as discretized maxima / minima or mixtures of discretized means rather than discretized means .",
    "copulas that arise from extreme value theory have more probability in one joint tail ( upper or lower ) than expected with a discretized mvn distribution or an mvn copula with discrete margins .",
    "it is also possible that there can be more probability in both the joint upper and joint lower tail , compared with discretized mvn models .",
    "this happens if the respondents consist of a  mixture \" population ( e.g. , different genders ) .",
    "from the theory of elliptical distributions and copulas , it is known that some scale mixtures of mvn have more dependence in the tails .",
    "the theory and application of copulas have become important in finance , insurance and other areas , in order to deal with dependence in the joint tails @xcite . here ,",
    "we indicate that this can also be important into the concept of assortative mating . the remainder of the paper proceeds as follows .",
    "section [ overview ] has a brief overview of relevant copula theory .",
    "section [ themodel ] introduces the joint copula - based markov model for discrete ordinal responses with covariates and discusses its relationship with existing models .",
    "section [ sec - families ] discusses suitable parametric families of copulas for the joint copula - based markov model for discrete ordinal responses with covariates .",
    "estimation techniques and computational details are provided in section [ estimation ] . section [ sec - appl ]",
    "presents the applications of our methodology to assortative mating using data from the german socio - economic panel over the period 20042012 .",
    "it turns out that our model , with linking copulas selected according to the ordinal responses being plausibly based on mixtures of means , provides better fit than the discretized mvn model .",
    "we conclude with some discussion in section [ sec - discussion ] .",
    "a copula is a multivariate cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) with uniform @xmath1 margins @xcite .",
    "if @xmath2 is a bivariate cdf with univariate margins @xmath3 , then sklar s ( 1959 ) theorem implies that there is a copula @xmath4 such that @xmath5 the copula is unique if @xmath3 are continuous , but not if some of the @xmath6 have discrete components .",
    "if @xmath2 is continuous and @xmath7 , then the unique copula is the distribution of @xmath8 leading to @xmath9 where @xmath10 are inverse cdfs .",
    "in particular , if @xmath11 is the bivariate normal ( bvn ) cdf with correlation @xmath12 and standard normal margins , and @xmath13 is the univariate standard normal cdf , then the bvn copula is @xmath14 the major advantage of copulas for dependence modelling is that the dependence structure may be separated from the univariate margins ; see , for example , section 1.6 of @xcite .",
    "if @xmath15 is a parametric family of copulas and @xmath16 is a parametric model for the @xmath17th univariate margin , then @xmath18 is a bivariate parametric model with univariate margins @xmath3 . for copula models , the variables can be continuous or discrete .",
    "for ease of exposition , let @xmath19 be the dimension of a  panel \" and @xmath20 the number of clusters .",
    "the theory can be extended to varying cluster sizes .",

    ", the response @xmath27 is assumed to have density @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a function of @xmath22 and the @xmath21-dimensional regression vector @xmath30 , and @xmath33 is the @xmath34-dimensional vector of the univariate cutpoints ( @xmath35 ) . note that @xmath36 normal leads to the ordinal probit model for ordinal response , @xmath36 logistic leads to the ordinal cumulative logit model .",
    "suppose that data are @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an index for individuals or clusters , @xmath39 is an index for the repeated measurements or within cluster measurements , and @xmath17 is an index for the gender : 1=male , 2=female .",
    "the univariate marginal model for @xmath40 is @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 of dimension @xmath44 be the vector of univariate cutpoints .",
    "if for each @xmath39 , @xmath45 are serially independent conditional on @xmath46 , then the log - likelihood for each gender is @xmath47    for estimation of @xmath48 when @xmath45 are dependent we consider copula - based markov models @xcite for ordinal time series with covariates , where a parametric copula family is used for the joint distribution of subsequent observations and then the corresponding transition probabilities are obtained .",
    "note in passing that @xcite studied copula - based markov models of continuous response data .",
    "the transition cdf of @xmath49 given @xmath50 is @xmath51/f(y_{t-1,j}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the transition pmf is @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "then the log - likelihood for each gender is @xmath54    the bvn copula is a special case , and this is called  autoregressive - to - anything \" in as acknowledged by @xcite .",
    "other copulas would be useful for the transition probability if there is more clustering of consecutive large or small values than would be expected with bvn .",
    "so far we treat the ordinal response of the males and the ordinal response of the females separately as if they were independent . in the sequel ,",
    "we novel propose to relate these responses using a copula to couple their conditional ( on the past ) distributions at each time point . from @xcite , there is a bivariate copula @xmath55 such that @xmath56 .",
    "then it follows that the joint pmf is @xmath57    for the joint copula - based markov model , we let @xmath58 and @xmath55 be parametric bivariate copulas , say with parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively . for the set of all parameters , let @xmath61 .",

    "firstly , the estimate of kendall s @xmath85 rises from 0.146 in 20048 to 0.191 in 200912 , and moreover , it may be verified from the associated standard errors that the two 95% confidence intervals do not overlap .",
    "hence we have evidence that kendall s @xmath85 rises with years of marriage .",
    "the second key difference is that the best - fitting joint model for the 20048 data is @xmath99 , while the best - fitting joint model for 200912 is @xmath100 .",
    "there is a reduction of one in the degrees of freedom of the best - fitting @xmath78 copula . both of these differences between the results in tables [ joint - copula-2004 - 8 ] and [ joint - copula-2009 - 12 ]",
    "provide evidence that dependence increases with years of marriage ; both in the middle of the distribution , and in the joint tails .",
    "at this point it is useful to recall that the sample used in this study is restricted to couples observed in every year .",
    "hence attrition ( poorly - matched couples dropping out of the sample ) is not an issue .",
    "this means that the increase in dependence seen in the comparison of tables 4 and 6 may be interpreted as clear evidence of `` socialization '' @xcite : the two members of the couple become more similar in terms of risk - attitude as their marriage progresses .",
    "assortative mating is a concept of great interest to economists , as evidenced by the extensive theoretical and empirical literatures devoted to it , dating back to @xcite .",
    "the econometric modelling of assortative mating is clearly a setting in which the precise nature of the dependence between two variables representing the relevant outcomes for the two members of the couple , becomes the central focus of the analysis .",
    "the copula approach provides the ideal framework for this sort of modelling , since it brings richness to the dependence structure .",
    "for example , it allows the modelling of both joint tails and moreover allows a variety of types of asymmetry in the dependence structure .",
    "importantly , this richness is introduced without the requirement of estimation of additional parameters .",
    "much is known about copulas .",
    "they have been used to great benefit in many areas ( e.g. , insurance , finance and hydrology ) , but have not been used much in economics .",
    "this paper illustrates their usefulness in a mainstream economics application : assortative mating on risk attitude . in this application , we have found evidence of both centre dependence and tail dependence .",
    "that is , over the entire range of of risk attitudes , there is a tendency for individuals to match with other individuals with similar risk attitude , and this positive dependence is particularly marked in the tails .",
    "this conclusion has been arrived at using a novel model which we have labelled the ",
    "joint copula - based markov model \" .",
    "the model consists of two stages . in the first stage ,",
    "males and females are considered separately , and a copula is used to model the joint distribution of neighbouring ( in time ) outcomes for a given individual .",
    "the best fitting copulas thus found are then combined using a third copula that couples the two conditional distributions at each time point .",
    "in all three cases , the best - fitting copula is found to be a @xmath78 with a small @xmath81 , which leads to a model with more probabilities in the joint upper and joint lower tails compared to the bvn copula . in this economics application , it is highlighted that a joint model with a @xmath78 copula is plausible for a population that is a mixture of subpopulations , while a bvn model might be adequate for smaller homogeneous subgroups .",
    "this fact leads to the conclusion of positive dependence in the tails , and we have found strong statistical evidence to confirm this , in the form of the vuong s statistic .    having reached this conclusion , we then extended the analysis by applying the same two - stage procedure separately for the 2004 - 8 and 2009 - 12 data .",
    "the key results here were that both middle and tail dependence were stronger in the second time range .",
    "we interpreted this in terms of the phenomenon of  socialization \" : the two members of the couple become more similar in risk attitude with the accumulation of years of marriage .",
