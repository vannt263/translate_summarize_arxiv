    "the correlations of black hole mass with galaxy properties imply a close link between black hole growth and galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "numerous theoretical and observational studies have been dedicated to revealing the nature of the connection ( e.g. , kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; springel et al .",

    "can shed light on how black hole growth and bulge growth are inter - connected .",
    "however , it is challenging to observationally measure both the starburst rate and agn activity for given galaxies .",
    "optically - identified broad - line agns are the best objects for measuring black hole mass and agn accretion rate . on the other hand",
    "the star formation rate of host galaxies is difficult to measure since agn flux dominates in the uv continuum and hydrogen recombination lines , i.e. , h@xmath1 , which are generally used as a star formation indicator in non - agn galaxies . in the case of type ii agn",
    ", it is relatively easy to measure star formation rate while black hole mass and accretion rate are difficult to determine owing to the dust obscuration of accretion disk and broad - line region .    the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features emitted by small carbon grains are one of the star formation indicators .",
    "thus , pah emissions have been used to constrain star formation activity in the host galaxies of type 1 agn ( e.g. , ogle et al .",
    "2006 ; schweitzer et al . 2006 ; shi et al .",
    "based on the ground - based and space observations , various pah emission features , i.e. , 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , and 12.7  lines , have been detected in many local seyfert 1 galaxies and distant qsos although not all agn show pah emission features .    among pah - detected agn , there seems to be a correlation between nuclear starburst and agn activity . using a sample of low - redshift palomar - green ( pg )",
    "qsos observed with the spitzer infrared spectrograph ( irs ) , @xcite showed that 7.7  pah luminosity increases with agn continuum luminosity at 5100   ( l@xmath2 ) , indicating the starburst - agn connection .",
    "high - redshift qsos seem to follow the same trend , extending the correlation to much higher luminosity range @xcite .",
    "the starburst - agn connection is supported by a number of theoretical studies , demonstrating that both nuclear starburst events and agn activity can be triggered by gas inflow through galaxy interactions ( e.g. , kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; robertson et al .",
    "2006 ; ciotti & ostriker 2007 ; hopkins et al . 2009 ) .    for lower luminosity agns",
    "it is less clear how agn activity is connected to starburst since agn power is more difficult to measure owing to increasing host galaxy contribution in lower luminosity agn .",
    "based on the ground - based l - band slit spectra , @xcite measured the 3.3  pah luminosity of local seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies , showing a positive correlation between starburst and agn activity although the correlation is not tight with a large scatter . in their study ,",
    "radio luminosity and n - band luminosity within 1.5  of the host galaxies are used as an indicator of agn power . using 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity",
    ", @xcite showed a similar trend between agn power and the 3.3  pah luminosity for a larger sample of local seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies .",
    "most previous observational studies on pah features with ground based long - slit spectroscopy or spitzer irs observations have probed the inner part of galaxies , indicating a connection between _ nuclear _ starburst within a few kpc and agn activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in contrast , whether global star formation over entire galaxies is related with agn activity it is not well studied since most previous studies , particularly for local and low - redshift galaxies , have used a relatively small aperture to extract pah emission features , measuring nuclear pah emissions . based on the spatially resolved mid - ir spectroscopy of nearby active galaxies , several studies have reported that pah emissions are mainly from the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , suggesting that the global pah luminosity measured over entire galaxies may be much larger than nuclear pah luminosity .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate global and nuclear star formation in the host galaxies of type 1 agn , using the 3.3  pah emission measurements based on our new observations with the akari space telescope and collected data from the literature .",
    "the akari telescope provides a unique capability of slit - less spectroscopy to measure global star formation over entire galaxies ( e.g. , imanishi et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ data ] , we describe sample selection , observations and data reduction of the akari observations .",
    "we present 3.3  pah emission measurements in  [ analysis ] .",
    "main results on the starburst - agn connection are presented in  [ results ] .",
    "discussion and conclusions are followed in   5 .",
    "throughout the paper , we assume a hubble constant of h@xmath3 = 70 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "we selected a sample of 27 moderate - luminosity agn ( l@xmath2 @xmath0 0.1 - 3 @xmath7 10@xmath8 erg s@xmath4 ) at 0.35 @xmath9 z @xmath9 0.36 from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 to study star formation activity based on the pah feature at 3.3 .",
    "the sample was initially selected for investigating the evolution of the black hole mass - stellar velocity dispersion ( m@xmath10 ) relation .",
    "details of sample selection can be found in @xcite and @xcite . in summary , we selected broad - line agns with the h@xmath11 equivalent width ( ew ) @xmath12 5    to properly estimate black hole masses based on the kinematics of broad - line region gas .",
    "the specific redshift range was selected to avoid sky emission lines on the stellar absorption features , from which stellar velocity dispersions were directly measured .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of 24 objects in the sample was in detail investigated by @xcite based on the multi - wavelength data including chandra x - ray observations , hst imaging , and spitzer irac and mips imaging as well as the archival data of galex and two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) . from the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting analysis ,",
    "agn sed was separated from galaxy sed , leading to accurate measurements of agn bolometric luminosities .",
    "black hole mass of each agn was estimated by the single - epoch virial method , which combines the line width of h@xmath11  and the optical luminosity at 5100(l@xmath13 ) , utilizing the size - luminosity relation of the reverberation sample ( bentz et al .",
    "2009 ) and the most recent calibration of the virial factor by @xcite ( see table 1 ) .",

    ", @xcite applied spline functions and lorentz profiles for fitting pah emission lines in various sources and found no systematic difference in the measured pah fluxes while @xcite applied drude profile to mid - ir spectra obtained from the @xmath19 irs .",
    "we chose a gaussian profile , which is generally adopted for the 3.3  pah emission lines observed in starburst galaxies ( type - a sources in tokunaga et al .",
    "1991 ) . in practice",
    ", we applied a gaussian profile with a fixed width in the rest - frame for modeling the 3.3  pah line .",
    "we adopted 21 nm as a fixed width of the line profile , which has been determined from the pah line profile of m82 ( tokunaga et al .",
    "1991 ) and used for our previous studies of the 3.3  pah line based on the akari irc spectra ( imanishi et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "continuum subtraction is the largest source of uncertainty in measuring pah emission line flux since absorption features are abundant in the near- and mid - ir spectral ranges .",
    "the vicinity of the 3.3 @xmath20 pah feature is not an exception : there is a plethora of absorption features in the rest - frame 2 - 5  range .",
    "we applied a linear fit to the continuum in the 3.0 - 3.6  range with two - pixel binning , after masking the location of the pah feature around the 3.3 @xmath20 , as similarly practiced in other studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while fitting the 3.3 @xmath20 pah feature by a gaussian profile , we determined the peak and the central wavelength of the profile based on the @xmath21 minimization .",
    "then , the line flux and the equivalent width were determined from the fit ( see table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "the typical error of the measured flux density is @xmath22 erg s@xmath4 @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "we detected the 3.3  pah feature from 7 out of 26 observed galaxies , resulting in a detection rate of 27% .",
    "compared to higher luminosity agn , the 3.3  pah detection rate of our lower - luminosity agn is slightly higher although the difference is not easy to interpret owing to the different exposure time and flux limits . for example , @xcite investigated the pah emission features of 30 pg qsos based on the ground - based observations , and detected the 3.3  pah emission from 5 qsos , resulting in a @xmath0 17% detection rate . if we exclude s3 and ss12 , for which 3.3  pah emission is marginally detected , then the detection rate of our lower - luminosity agn decreases to 19% , suggesting that the detection rate is similar to that of pg qsos .",
    "compared to the detection rate of other pah lines at longer wavelength ( e.g. , 6.7 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.2 ) in local seyfert galaxies , the detection rate of the 3.3  pah line in our sample seems to be much lower ( see sales et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this difference may be due to the fact that 3.3  pah is much weaker than other lines at longer wavelength , thus more difficult to be detected . for better understanding of the relation among various pah lines , spectroscopic studies with a large spectral range including 3.3  and",
    "other pah lines are required .",
    "the detected 3.3  pah line luminosity ( l@xmath25 ) ranges from @xmath26 erg s@xmath4   while the upper limit of the pah luminosity of the undetected galaxies is close to @xmath27 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "compared to the 3.3  pah luminosity range of type i agn host galaxies measured from ground - based observations ( l@xmath25=10@xmath28 - 10@xmath29 erg s@xmath4 ) , the 3.3  pah luminosities from the akari slit - less spectroscopy are more than a factor of 10 higher .",
    "this is probably due to the aperture effect , reflecting the difference between nuclear and global star formation .",
    "ground - based observations generally used a narrow - slit to probe nuclear starburst while akari slit - less spectroscopy provides the global star formation rate over entire galaxies .",
    "a direct comparison between ground - based and akari observations supports this interpretation .",
    "for example , a recent akari study by @xcite reported the 3.3  pah luminosity of ngc 7469 as @xmath30 erg s@xmath4   while the ground - based spectroscopy with a 1.6  slit width by @xcite presented an upper limit of @xmath31erg s@xmath4 , indicating that the nuclear pah emission is a small fraction of the global pah emission .    for galaxies with no 3.3 @xmath20 pah emission detection , we measured the upper limits .",
    "first , we averaged the 1 @xmath32 errors at the wavelength range of the expected 3.3  pah line .",
    "then , we assumed a gaussian profile with a peak flux , which is 3 times larger than the average 1 @xmath32 error . in the case of the line width of the profile ,",
    "we used a constant width of 21 nm in the rest - frame .",
    "the measurements and upper limits of the 3.3  pah luminosity are listed in table 2 .      in order to construct the representative spectra of the sample and to recover the undetected 3.3  pah in individual galaxies",
    ", we constructed two combined spectra respectively for the entire sample and the galaxies with no 3.3  pah emission detection . to construct stacked spectra",
    ", we used a wavelength range between 3.1 - 3.5   in the rest frame and normalized individual spectra by a continuum fit .",
    "then , we summed individual spectra without weighting .",
    "we also applied two - pixel binning to the data points outside of the 3.3  pah line to smooth the continuum .",
    "the stacked spectra of the entire sample and the galaxies with no 3.3  pah detection are presented in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the combined spectrum of the entire sample clearly shows the 3.3 @xmath20 pah emission . by fitting the pah emission using a gaussian profile with a width of 21 nm , we measured the ew of the 3.3 @xmath20 pah line .",
    "the ew of pah in our sample is larger than that of qsos .",
    "for example , based on a sample of pg qsos , @xcite reported that the ews of the 3.3  pah emission of individual galaxies are typically less than 10 nm while the ew of the 3.3  pah emission measured from their combined spectrum is only 1 nm . the smaller ew of pah emission in higher luminosity agn may be interpreted to mean that pah lines are diluted by higher agn continuum .",

    "ngc 7469 was observed with a ground - based spectrograph with a narrow - slit and the akari irc , respectively . the flux ratio between nuclear l@xmath25   and the upper limit of the global l@xmath25  is @xmath00.04 .",
    "thus we took this ratio as a calibration factor and scale down the akari measurements by a factor of 0.04 .    in figure 5",
    ", we present the correlation between the nuclear 3.3  pah luminosity and agn optical luminosity at 5100   for the combined sample .",
    "the type i agn from ground - based observations clearly show a correlation , suggesting the nuclear starburst - agn connection .",
    "the l@xmath25  of the moderate - luminosity agn at z@xmath00.4 , which are calibrated for representing the nuclear pah emission , are consistent with the trend found by nuclear l@xmath25  measurements although they are more scattered probably due to the uncertainty of the calibration .    using the nuclear l@xmath25  measurements from ground - based spectroscopy , we fit the relation between l@xmath25  and agn luminosity . since most of the l@xmath25  measurements in the literature",

    "the best - fit relation is : @xmath42 the best - fit slope of @xmath00.8 indicates that the correlation is not linear .",
    "this implies that for higher luminosity agn , the nuclear starburst - to - agn luminosity ratio is smaller , albeit with the small sample size .    in figure 6 , we compare nuclear l@xmath25  with the eddington ratio and black hole mass to test whether the accretion rate and black hole mass correlates with starburst activity .",
    "we estimate the eddington ratio by multiplying a factor of 9 to the agn optical luminosity . in the case of the eddington ratio ,",
    "there is a general trend that higher eddington ratio objects show higher nuclear starburst activity although there is a large scatter .",
    "black hole mass shows a similar trend with l@xmath25  in that the host galaxies of higher mass agn show higher nuclear starburst luminosity .",
    "this can be interpreted as the trend that higher mass agn in the sample are generally higher luminosity agn , i.e. , pg qsos .",
    "thus , the relation between black hole mass and pah luminosity reflects the correlation between agn power and l@xmath25 .",
    "to investigate the starburst - agn connection , we compared the global and nuclear 3.3  pah emission with agn luminosity using a sample of type i agn .",
    "the global 3.3  pah emission luminosities are measured for moderate - luminosity agn at z@xmath00.4 , based on our new akari slit - less spectroscopy , which covers the entire host galaxies .",
    "we find no strong correlation between 3.3  pah and agn optical luminosities within the limited agn luminosity range 10@xmath8 - 10@xmath43 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "this result may imply that the global star formation is not strongly related with agn activity although we can not rule out a weak correlation with a considerable scatter .",
    "we note that since the agn luminosity range is very limited , whether the global star formation rate correlates with agn activity is inconclusive .",
    "in contrast , when we compare agn luminosity of the local seyfert 1 galaxies and pg qsos with their nuclear 3.3  pah emission luminosity , we detect a strong correlation , suggesting that that agn activity is related to the nuclear starburst .",
    "these results are consistent with the findings of previous studies on the starburst - agn connection @xcite .",
    "the slope of the l@xmath25  correlation with agn luminosity in figure 5 shows that the l@xmath25  to agn luminosity ratio decreases toward higher agn luminosity . at face value",
    ", it implies that the nuclear starburst activity is slightly suppressed in the host galaxies of high luminosity agn ( for different predictions on the starburst - to - accretion ratios , see e.g. , kawakatu & wada 2008 ; ballantyne 2008 ) .",
    "a similar trend was noted by @xcite in comparing 7.7  pah emission and agn luminosities . in their study ,",
    "high luminosity agn with l@xmath2 @xmath12 10@xmath44 erg s@xmath4   show a much lower starburst - to - agn ratio ( see figure 6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying that the black hole growth rate normalized by the starburst rate is a factor of 10 higher in their high redshift qsos than in the local agn . in our local sample",
    "the decrease of the starburst - to - agn ratio with increasing agn luminosity is not as dramatic as in high redshift qsos , but if confirmed , it implies that for low - luminosity agn the growth of galaxy centers is faster than black hole growth in the present - day universe .",
    "however , it is not clear whether black hole growth is slower or faster than the total host galaxy growth since only nuclear starbursts are compared in our analysis .",
    "we note that there are many agn with no pah emission detection . including the upper limits of these objects",
    "significantly weakens the correlation between l@xmath25  and agn luminosity . although the true pah luminosities of these objects may be close to the upper limits within a factor of few , a detailed investigation using a large sample with lower flux limits is necessary to probe the slope and scatter of the correlation .",
