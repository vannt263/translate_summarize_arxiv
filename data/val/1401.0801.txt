    "particles in many soft - matter and biological systems are charged , and repel each other with screened electrostatic interactions @xcite .",
    "the repulsion is also present between particles covered by polymeric brushes @xcite and between membrane proteins  @xcite ; in the latter case the repulsion can be caused by elastic deformations of the lipid membrane@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the particles attract each other with the van der waals and with solvent - mediated solvophobic , depletion or casimir effective potentials @xcite .",
    "in addition , capillary forces between the particles trapped on liquid interfaces are present @xcite .",
    "the sum of all the interactions often has a form of the short - range attraction and long - range repulsion ( salr potential )  @xcite .",
    "the attraction favours phase separation , while the repulsion suppresses the growth of the clusters . as a result",
    ", the particles can form different patterns on surfaces , fluid interfaces or membranes .",
    "the stable patterns are determined by the competition between the disordering effect of the thermal motion , the chemical potential controlling the number of particles , and the attractive and repulsive parts of the interaction potential .",
    "the topology of the phase diagram for particles interacting with the salr potential is expected to be similar to the topology of the phase diagram in amphiphilic systems @xcite .",
    "the determination of the phase diagram for a particular form of the salr potential , however , is a real challenge both on the experimental and on the theoretical side .",
    "there are many metastable states and the time scale of ordering is large .",
    "the periods of density oscillations in different ordered phases can be different , and may depend on the thermodynamic state .",
    "this leads to incommensurability of the period of oscillations and the system size .",
    "the incommensurability may strongly influence the theoretical and simulation results . because of the above difficulties , the complete phase diagram for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system was determined so far in the density - functional theory ( dft ) for one particular shape of the salr potential@xcite .",
    "for the same shape of the salr potential a sketch of the phase diagram was obtained in ref.@xcite by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . the potential @xmath3 considered in ref.@xcite consisted of two exponentially",
    "decaying terms with the decay rates and amplitudes ( of opposite sign ) ensuring the global balance between the attraction and the repulsion , i.e. @xmath4 .",
    "in this work we are interested in the salr potentials leading to formation of small clusters or thin stripes separated by distances comparable to their thickness . such patterns can be formed when the range of the attraction is @xmath5 and the range of the repulsion is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the particle diameter .",
    "the above interaction ranges are expected for cone - shape membrane proteins when a cluster of a few molecules induces a large local curvature of the lipid bilayer , and for charged nanoparticls or globular proteins in solvents with weak ionic strength . in the latter systems",
    "the decay rate of the repulsion , i.e. the debye screening length , depends on the dielectric constant and the concentration of ions and takes the values @xmath8 .",

    "the range of the attractive solvophobic and/or depletion forces between the nanoparticles or proteins is a little bit larger than @xmath7 .",

    "the or and hc phases respectively are more stable than the vacuum . in these phases the noninteracting clusters are packed as densely as possible ( fig.[gs ] b and e ) .    the hc and or phases coexist with the lamellar phase for @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively .",

    "the mesoscopic fluctuations are neglected , whereas in the salr systems the displacements of the clusters or stripes lead to formation of the disordered cluster fluid or molten lamella .",

    "the phase diagrams obtained in the dft @xcite and in mc simulations @xcite differ significantly from each other .",
    "the main features present on the mc and absent on the dft phase diagram are : ( i ) a stability of the cluster fluid phase between the ordered cluster phase and the homogeneous fluid ( ii ) a reentrant melting of the ordered cluster phase for high temperatures .",

    "two conclusions follow : ( i ) the cluster fluid is stable for low @xmath140 up to the density @xmath240 or larger , and ( ii ) the transition to the lamellar phase is fluctuation - induced first order .",
