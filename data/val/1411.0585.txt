    "in the conventional quark model , mesons are composed of a pair of quark and antiquark ( @xmath1 ) while baryons are composed of three quarks ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "hadrons with different quark contents from @xmath1 or @xmath2 are called exotic states , such as glueballs , hybrids , multiquarks and so on .",
    "although these exotic hadron configurations are allowed in qcd , there was no significant evidence of their existence until recently .",
    "since 2003 , many new charmonium - like and bottomonium - like states were observed experimentally ( see refs.@xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "these new states were observed through either the hidden - charm / hidden - bottom or open - charm / open - bottom final states and thus contain a heavy quark - antiquark pair .",
    "however , some of these states do not fit in the conventional quark model and are considered as candidates for exotic states . to explore the underlying structures of these xyz states ,",
    "many theoretical speculations have been proposed such as the molecular states , quarkonium - like tetraquark states , quarkonium hybrids and conventional quarkonium states .",
    "hadronic molecules are loosely bound states composed of two heavy mesons@xmath3 , in which @xmath4 represents a heavy quark ( charm or bottom quark ) and @xmath5 a light quark ( up , down or strange quark ) .",
    "they are probably bound by the long - range color - singlet pion exchange .",
    "the masses of the molecules are slightly lower than some open - flavor thresholds .",
    "some xyz states , such as @xmath6 and the charged @xmath7 states , were discovered to be very close to the open - charm / bottom thresholds .",
    "they were naturally considered as candidates of the molecular states .",
    "tetraquarks are composed of a pair of diquark and antidiquark @xmath8 , which are bound by the colored force between quarks .",
    "they can decay into a pair of heavy mesons or one charmonium / bottomonium plus a light meson through rearrangement process .",
    "thus the tetraquarks are expected to be very broad resonances @xcite .",
    "hybrids are bound states of a quark - antiquark pair and an excited gluon .",
    "the @xmath9 meson was considered as a compelling candidate of the charmonium hybrid @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopy of these exotic hadrons should be studied systematically to improve our understanding of the relations between the exotic hadrons and the newly observed xyz states .    in this talk , we focus on the quarkonium - like tetraquark states and the quarkonium hybrid states .",
    "we briefly introduce our recent results of the mass spectra of these systems .",
    "we then try to understand the nature of some xyz states using the formalisms of tetraquark states and charmonium hybrids .",
    "in the past several decades , qcd sum rules have been proven to be a very powerful non - perturbative tool to study the hadron structures@xcite .",

    "the basic idea of qcd sum rule approach is that this two - point function can be achieved at both the hadron level and the quark - gluon level .",
    "a fundamental assumption is the quark - hadron duality , which ensures the equivalence of the correlation functions obtained at these two levels .    at the hadron level",
    ", the correlation function is described via the dispersion relation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the unknown subtraction constant which can be removed by taking the borel transform .",
    "@xmath14 is the spectral function in the narrow resonance approximation @xmath15    the two - point function @xmath16 can also be calculated at the quark - gluonic level via the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xmath17|0\\rangle=\\sum_nc_n(q^2)o_n\\,,~q^2=-q^2\\,,\\ ] ] in which @xmath18 are the wilson coefficients and @xmath19 are the various qcd condensates , including the quark condensate @xmath20 , gluon condensate @xmath21 , quark - gluonmixed condensate @xmath22 , tri - gluon condensate @xmath23 , four quark condensate @xmath24 , and dimension-8 condensate @xmath25 . in general , the wilson coefficients @xmath18 can be calculated in perturbation theory and expressed in terms of the qcd parameters such as the quark mass and the strong coupling constant @xmath26 .",
    "the long distance non - perturbative effects are included in the various condensates @xmath19 , which are ordered by increasing dimension in the expansion .",
    "we then can obtain information on hadron properties by equating the two - point correlation functions at these two levels .",
    "the mass sum rules are usually established after performing borel transform of both sides @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the continuum threshold and borel mass respectively and @xmath29 .",
    "the lowest lying hadron mass is then extracted as @xmath30    in the next two sections , we will introduce the qcd sum rule study of the mass spectra of the quarkonium - like tetraquark states and quarkonium hybrid states .",
    "the diquark ( @xmath31 ) concept plays a very important role in the study of the tetraquark states .",
    "they are the bricks used to construct a tetraquark field ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the properties of diquark fields , including their spins , parities , flavor , color and lorentz structures were studied in refs.@xcite tetraquarks ( @xmath32 ) are then composed of diquarks and antidiquarks .",
    "the low - lying scalar mesons below 1 gev have been considered as good candidates of the light tetraquark states@xcite . in the heavy quark sector ,",
    "some of the recently observed quarkonium - like states were suggested to be candidates of hidden charm / bottom @xmath33-type tetraquark states @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 was the first charmonium - like state discovered in b - factories .",
    "it was reported in 2003 by belle collaboration in the @xmath34 final states on the process of @xmath35@xcite .",
    "ten years after that , the lhcb collaboration determined its quantum numbers as @xmath36@xcite .",
    "recently , the family of the charged quarkonium - like states has become more abundant .",
    "the first charged state @xmath37 was observed in the @xmath38 invariant mass spectrum in the process @xmath39 by the belle collaboration  @xcite and confirmed recently by the lhcb collaboration  @xcite .",
    "later , the besiii collaboration reported @xmath40@xcite , which was confirmed quickly by the belle collaboration@xcite and by using cleo data@xcite .",
    "the besiii collaboration also observed @xmath41@xcite and @xmath42 @xcite later .",
    "this year , the belle collaboration reported two new charged states @xmath43 @xcite and @xmath44@xcite .",
    "moreover , the belle collaboration also observed two charged bottomonium - like states @xmath45 and @xmath46@xcite .",
    "all these resonances have the exotic flavor content @xmath47 for @xmath48 states and @xmath49 for @xmath50 states .",
