    "several authors in the physics community ( including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) have written about the appearance of log - periodic oscillations in stock market indices during the months and years leading up to financial crashes .  by a log - periodic oscillation , we mean that a variable exhibits a functional form such as @xmath0   \\text{.}\\label{lp}%\\ ] ] the cosine term in this expression produces oscillations with a period that grows or shrinks exponentially .",
    "as an example , if we let @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the time of the well - known crash of october 19 , 1987 , then we can see this pattern in the standard and poor s 500 ( s&p  500 ) during the five years prior to the crash as shown in fig .",
    "[ abs index ] .",
    "such log - periodic oscillations are of interest to physicists because log - periodicity is the signature of a spatial environment with a discrete scaling symmetry .  the observation of log - periodic precursors has been interpreted as evidence that the subsequent financial crash can be viewed as a critical point analogous to a phase transition in a more traditional physics environment .",
    "heuristically , this picture of a transition to an ordered state is certainly consistent with what happens during a stock market crash , when virtually all investors will be in agreement that the price is dropping and that they should sell , in contrast to the normal disordered state where the price remains fairly stable because there is a buyer for every seller .",
    "the theoretical issue is how far this analogy can properly be taken .",
    "[ ptb ]    lpfig1.epsi    one can envision a discrete scaling symmetry arising in financial markets if one models investors as forming networks of friends and contacts .",
    "if every agent has @xmath3 contacts , it is indeed possible to construct a network which exhibits a scaling symmetry .",
    "johansen et al .",
    "@xcite propose a model of imitative investors , living in such a network , which is essentially an ising spin model .",
    "a spin - up constituent represents a buyer , a spin - down constituent represents a seller , and neighboring spins interact in a manner that encourages them to align in the same direction .",
    "johansen et al .",
    "respond to the criticism that a rational agent could exploit log - periodic fluctuations to his financial advantage , and thereby acquire all the wealth in the economy , by requiring that stock prices obey a martingale condition that would rule out arbitrage opportunities .",
    "how the collective behavior of the imitative investors translates into a price that satisfies this martingale condition is left unmodeled .",
    "regardless of the underlying details , this martingale condition is a very strong restriction on the behavior of prices , and testing this condition is the primary focus of the present paper .",
    "a major deficiency of the vast body of previous work on log - periodic precursors is that most of the analysis has been qualitative rather than statistical in nature .",
    "the emphasis has been placed on establishing the existence of log - periodic fluctuations , usually through curve - fitting or more recently through the use of lomb periodograms ( @xcite ) .",
    "we should note that we take it as a given in this paper that such methods are valid .",
    "we do not dispute the existence of log - periodic fluctuations like those pictured in fig .",
    "[ abs index ] .",
    "what remains controversial is why these fluctuations exist .",
    "are they indeed part of a collective process leading up to a phase transition ?  or can they be more simply explained as an accidental feature of the stochastic processes that drive financial indices ?  only statistical methods have the power to distinguish these possibilities .",
    "a small amount of work has already been done in this vein .",
    "feigenbaum and freund @xcite modeled the stock market as a random walk and found that the average time between a log - periodic spell and the next financial crash was significantly longer in real - world data than in monte carlo simulations .",
    "johansen et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) report similar results from an experiment where they modeled the stock market as a garch process .",
    "while these are positive results with respect to the hypothesis of crashes as critical points , they are both strongly tied to a specific model of the underlying stochastic process , what statisticians term the data generating process ( dgp ) .",
    "one can not extrapolate from these two results to conclude that no dgp  can account for log - periodicity .",
    "the null hypothesis that log - periodic spells are the casual products of random fluctuations.has _ not _ been rejected .",
    "while most studies of log - periodicity have focused on prices , the present paper applies statistical hypothesis testing to the question of whether the first differences of a price process exhibiting log - periodic fluctuations are also log - periodic .",
    "this question is of interest because any model in which log - periodic price fluctuations reflect corresponding fluctuations in the mean of the price process will require that the mean of the first differences should also behave log - periodically .  in particular , the model of johansen",
    "@xcite requires this .",
    "moreover , it is well - known among econometricians that regression estimators are inconsistent when applied to a serially - correlated time series like a stock price .  first differencing the stock price",
    "can substantially eliminate this serial correlation and may eliminate effects produced by it .",
    "consequently , the absence of log - periodic fluctuations from the first differences of a price process suggests ( although certainly does not prove ) that log - periodicity in the integrated price process may be due to serial correlation and random effects .",
    "examining the first differences for the logarithm of the s&p 500 from 1980 to 1987 , we find that the log - periodic component of the sornette - johansen specification is statistically significant if we include this entire period in the fit .",
    "however , if we exclude the last year , the log - periodic component is no longer statistically significant .",
    "furthermore , the best fit in this truncated data set predicts a crash in june of 1986 , shortly after the data set ends but well before the actual crash .",
    "presumably the log - periodic fit is coupling to some structure in the data just prior to the crash which does not characterize the whole time series .",
    "thus we conclude that log - periodicity is either negligible or not present in these first differences , a negative result for the model of johansen et al .",
    "@xcite .    a second claim that we consider was put forward by johansen and sornette @xcite and pertains to the distribution of drawdowns , where a drawdown is the accumulated drop in an index from a local maximum to the next local minimum .",
    "assuming that the fat - tailed distribution of daily returns falls off exponentially in the limit of large negative returns , they derive that the distribution of drawdowns should also be exponential .",
    "empirically , they find that the frequency distribution of drawdowns over the past century does indeed look exponential except for three outliers , the 29 and 87 crashes and a crash during world war i.  they infer from this that a different mechanism must be responsible for these outliers and suggest that this mechanism is also responsible for producing log - periodic oscillations .  in principle , however , one can examine any set of data with one dependent variable and say that the graph looks exponential except for some outliers .  in order to make this a testable claim ,",
    "one has to consider whether there are statistically significant deviations from the exponential curve .",
    "in fact , statistically significant deviations do occur , and we conclude that this evidence of a special crash mechanism is unconvincing .    the paper proceeds as follows .",
    "in section [ sjp ] , we review the basic elements of the sornette - johansen framework and note some theoretical criticisms .",
    "since the initial papers on this subject appeared , sornette and johansen @xcite have developed a more sophisticated specification for observed log - periodic oscillations , treating the logarithm of the price index as the dependent variable rather than the price itself .",
    "we will see in section [ logspec ] that the logarithmic specification does fit the s&p  500 prior to the 87 crash .",
    "it also fits to the s&p 500 prior to downturns in 1974 , 1997 , 1998 , and an otherwise unremarkable downturn of less than 1% in 1985 .",
    "this last finding raises the spectre that perhaps log - periodic behavior is not especially noteworthy and is not inherently related to crashes .  in section [ fd",
    "] , we examine the first differences of the logarithm of the s&p  500 during the period of 1980 to 1987 and test the statistical significance of the log - periodic component of the  sornette - johansen specification .  in section [ ddd ] , we consider the distribution of drawdowns over the period from 1962 to 1998 and examine whether the 87 crash deserves classification as an outlier",
    ".  finally , in section [ cr ] , we offer some concluding remarks .",
    "johansen et al . @xcite model the behavior of a speculative stock which pays no dividends .  they allow for the possibility that at least one rational , risk neutral agent with rational expectations , who does not discount the future , exists in their economy .",
    "given this assumption , the stock price @xmath4 must follow a martingale .  for all @xmath5 , @xmath6   = p(t),\\label{martingale}%\\ ] ] where @xmath7 denotes the expectation operator conditional on all information available at @xmath8 .",
    "strictly speaking , the @xmath7 operator in eq .",
    "( [ martingale ] ) would refer to an expectation based on the beliefs of the hypothesized agent .",
    "when we say the agent has rational expectations , we mean the agent s beliefs in fact correspond to reality , so @xmath7 is also the objective expectation operator .    in a market equilibrium where agents behave optimally",
    "according to their preferences , eq .",
    "( [ martingale ] ) is an endogenous no - arbitrage condition that must hold for markets to clear .  if @xmath9>p(t)$ ]",
    ", a risk - neutral agent will find it profitable to hold an infinite amount of the stock .",
    "consequently , rational agents will bid up the price at @xmath8 until eq .",
    "( [ martingale ] ) is satisfied .",
    "similarly , if @xmath10<p(t)$ ] , rational agents will find it profitable to sell short an infinite amount of the stock .",
    "since the supply of stock is finite , neither of these two possibilities is consistent with equilibrium .",
    "since the stock pays no dividends , its fundamental value ( the expected present value of the stream of future dividends ) is zero , so any positive price constitutes a `` bubble '' .  in a world of perfect certainty , for @xmath11 , eq .",
    "( [ martingale ] ) would translate to the trivial difference equation @xmath12 and it would follow by mathematical induction that @xmath13 must be a constant .",
    "if we assume that bubbles can not be sustained forever , then a transversality condition ( essentially the boundary condition at the end of time ) will hold : @xmath14 in that case , we will have @xmath15 for all @xmath8 .",
    "given the transverality condition , bubbles can not arise under perfect certainty .  with uncertainty",

    "the connection of this theory to physics lies in the determination of the hazard rate function @xmath28 .",
    "in addition to any rational agents in the economy , johansen et al . posit the existence of a large number of irrational noise traders , and it is these noise traders who are responsible for any dynamics leading up to a crash .",
    "they construct a `` microscopic '' model in which the noise traders are imitative investors who reside on a local interaction network .",
    "neighbors of an agent on this network can be viewed as the agent s friends or contacts , and an agent will incorporate the views of his neighbors regarding the stock into his own view .    at time @xmath8 , each agent @xmath29 is assumed to be in one of two states :  a bullish state @xmath30 or a bearish state @xmath31 .",
    "if we denote the set of nearest neighbors as @xmath32 , given the states of all his neighbors at @xmath8 , @xmath29 s state at @xmath33 will be determined by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a constant and @xmath36 is an i.i.d .",

    "instead , one typically writes eq .",
    "( [ gen mar ] )  as @xmath51,\\label{gen mar2}%\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is often called the pricing kernel .",
    "( [ gen mar2 ] ) can still be viewed as describing a martingale process because the pricing kernel can be interpreted as a radon - nikodym derivative which transforms the probability distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , this transformed probability distribution will no longer correspond to the objective probability distribution , even under the rational expectations hypothesis .    in @xcite ,",
    "johansen et al .",
    "respond to ilinksi s criticism , but their rebuttal applies only to the martingale condition of eq .",
    "( [ constant kernel ] ) and not to the more general condition of eq .",

    "their argument is that , since @xmath50 in ( [ constant kernel ] ) is a finite constant , it can not have any impact on the log - periodicity of @xmath53 $ ] , and this would be correct if the pricing kernel was a constant .  however , the pricing kernel in general is not a constant and is not even a function of the price .",
    "thus , it is not obvious that variations in the pricing kernel could not counteract variations in the price in such a way as to disrupt any log - periodicity .",
    "moreover , the determination of the pricing kernel is a highly non - trivial problem if there exists a multiplicity of rational agents who are not identical .  since johansen et al . do not model how the collective behavior of the noise traders is translated into a price ,",
    "it is not possible for us to even begin such a computation .",
    "but corresponding to every rational agent , there would be an equation like . ( [ gen mar2 ] ) which would have to be satisfied , and",
    "it is not clear that a log - periodic price trend could be made compatible with each and every one of these martingale conditions .",
    "nevertheless , if we ignore the possibility of risk - averse agents , we do have a workable model , and we will see in section [ fd ] whether eq .",
    "( [ price ] ) with a log - periodic hazard rate function is consistent with the behavior of the s&p 500 prior to the 1987 crash .",
    "although early investigations of log - periodic fluctuations in stock market indices prior to financial crashes focused on the specification of eq .",
    "( [ lp ] ) , sornette and johansen @xcite introduced an alternative specification in which it is the logarithm of the price rather than the absolute price which fluctuates log - periodically .",

    "it is also more straightforward to compare the logarithmic specification to the once popular hypothesis that the logarithm of a stock price will follow a random walk with drift .",

    "note that in the sornette - johansen paradigm , @xmath2 does not necessarily correspond to the time of the crash per se ( which we will denote by @xmath73 ) but to a critical time where the probability of a crash becomes very large .  in terms of the microscopic model in @xcite , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number of nearest neighbors of each agent .",
    "consequently , if their model is correct , @xmath76 .",
    "sornette and johansen also suggest making this restriction so that @xmath4 does not become unbounded as @xmath77 .",

    "we obtain the best values of the linear parameters @xmath79 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 using ordinary least squares ( ols ) methods .",
    "the square of the residual vector @xmath83 is not a well - behaved concave ( down ) function , so the local minimum obtained by the downhill simplex method will depend on the initial starting point fed to the routine .",
    "indeed , as was noted in @xcite , one typically finds many local minima with fairly similar values of @xmath83 .",
