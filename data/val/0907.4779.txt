    "we study the matter - wave bistability in coupled atom - molecule quantum gases , in which heteronuclear molecules are created via an interspecies feshbach resonance involving either two - species bose or two - species fermi atoms at zero temperature .",
    "we show that the resonant two - channel bose model is equivalent to the nondegenerate parametric down - conversion in quantum optics , while the corresponding fermi model can be mapped to a quantum optics model that describes a single - mode laser field interacting with an ensemble of inhomogeneously broadened two - level atoms .  using these analogies and the fact that both models are subject to the kerr nonlinearity due to the two - body s - wave collisions ,",
    "we show that under proper conditions ,  the population in the molecular state in both models can be made to change with the feshbach detuning in a bistable fashion .",
    "the ability to cool and trap neutral atoms down to quantum degenerate regime has created a host of new and exciting problems that are increasingly interdisciplinary , bridging in particular the atomic , molecular , and optical physics and the condensed matter physics . the rich knowledge and experience accumulated over the past several decades in these fields",
    "have dramatically accelerated the progress of ultracold atomic physics .",
    "an example that serves to illustrate how the interdisciplinary fields learn and benefit from each other is the phenomonon of atomic pairing where a bosoinc molecule is coupled to two bosonic or fermionic constituent atoms via feshbach resonance or photoassociation .",
    "so far this is the only viable approach to create ultracold molecules .",
    "it is also an ideal test ground for studying coupled atom - molecule condensates and the bcs - bec crossover @xcite .",
    "the latter is thought to be underlying the mechanism of high temperature superconductors and extensively studied in the realm of condensed matter physics .",
    "in addition , the coupled atom - molecule systems have deep quantum optical analogies @xcite : bosoinc molecules coupled to bosonic atoms ( which we will refer to as the bosonic model in this paper ) is the matter - wave analog of parametric coupling of photons which has important applications in generating nonclassical light fields and , more recently , in quantum information science ; while the system of bosonic molecules coupled to fermionic atoms ( which we will refer to as the fermionic model ) can be mapped to the dicke model where a light field interacts with an ensemble of two - level atoms , a model having fundamental importance in the field of quantum optics .    in this work",
    ", we will further explore these quantum optical analogies of the atom - molecule system and focus on the important effects of binary collisional interactions between atoms which are largely ignored in previous studies @xcite .",
    "we show that the atom - atom interaction introduces extra nonlinear terms which , under certain conditions , give rise to matter - wave bistability in both bosonic and fermionic models .",
    "hence , we may establish the connection between the coupled atom - molecule quantum gases and the nonlinear bistable systems @xcite that have been extensively studied in the 80 s in the context of nonlinear optics , due both to its fundamental interest , and to its many practical applications in fast optical switches , optical memory , laser pulse shaping , etc .",
    "in what we call the bosonic model , a molecule associated with annihilation operator @xmath0 is coupled to two non - identical atoms labeled as @xmath1 and @xmath2 with corresponding annihilation operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . here",
    "we consider two types of atoms in order to make direct comparisons with the fermionic model to be treated in the next section , for which only unlike fermionic atoms can pair with each other and form a bosonic molecule .",

    "it is quite clear from the form of the second - quantized hamiltonian in eq .",

    "we have solved the dynamical equations ( [ dyneq ] ) using the slightly perturbed steady state solution as the initial condition . from the dynamical evolution of the system one can see that , just like in the bosonic model , the states in the upper and lower branches are dynamically stable : when slightly perturbed , they exhibit damped oscillations around their equilibrium values .",
    "these oscillations can be further understood from the excitation spectrum of the corresponding steady state .",
    "this can be done using a linear stability analysis , which is also the standard tool for studying laser instabilities @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is found to contain a discrete part which determines the oscillation frequencies , and a continuous part which contributes to the damping of these oscillations at a much longer time scale @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the states in the middle branch are unstable as small perturbations will lead to large departures .",
    "the bistability has important ramifications in atom - molecule conversion dynamics .",
    "when the collisional term is unimportant and negligible , one can easily create bosonic molecules from fermionic atoms by adiabatically sweeping the feshbach detuning across the resonance .",
    "as long as the sweeping speed is sufficiently slow , the molecular population will follow the steady - state curve as shown in fig .",
    "[ steady](a ) .",
    "by contrast , when bistability induced by the collisional term occurs , the adiabaticity condition will necessarily break down .",
    "[ sweep ] displays the dynamical evolution of the bosonic population when the detuning is swept starting either from a large positive or a large negative value .",
    "we can see that the steady - state curve can be followed up to the point where the stable states of the upper and lower branches and the unstable states of the middle branch join each other ( indicated by @xmath105 and @xmath106 in fig .",
    "[ sweep ] ) , where the population suddenly jumps between the two stable branches . note that the critical detuning @xmath107 for the first - order phase transition as indicated by the vertical line in fig .",
    "[ steady](b ) lies between @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the dynamical population curve thus exhibits hysteresis in the vicinity of the first - order phase transition . in this way , by tuning the detuning in the vicinity of @xmath105 or @xmath106 , an atom - molecule switch can be realized .",
    "similar behavior is also found in the bosonic model .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the matter - wave bistability in coupled atom - molecule quantum gases in both the bosonic and the fermionic models .",
    "these two cases can be mapped to two very different quantum optical models : parametric downconversion in the former and generalized dicke model in the latter .",
    "nevertheless , one important common feature for both cases is that bistability can be induced by collisional interactions which give rise to kerr nonlinearity .",
