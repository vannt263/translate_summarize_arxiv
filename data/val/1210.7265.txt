    "the pilot - wave version of quantum theory was originated in the 1920s by louis de broglie , re - discovered and developed in 1952 by david bohm , and championed in more recent decades especially by john stewart bell .",
    "@xcite usually described as a `` hidden variable '' theory , the pilot - wave account of quantum phenomena supplements the usual description of quantum systems  in terms of wave functions  with definite particle positions that obey a deterministic evolution law .",
    "this can be understood as the simplest possible account of `` wave - particle duality '' : individual particles ( electrons , photons , etc . )",
    "manage to behave sometimes like waves and sometimes like particles because each one is literally both . in , for example ,",
    "an interference experiment involving a single electron , the final outcome will be a function of the position of the particle at the end of the experiment .",
    "( in short , detectors `` click '' when particles hit them . ) but the trajectory of the particle is not at all classical ; it is instead determined by the structure of the associated quantum wave which guides or `` pilots '' the particle .    the main virtue of the theory ,",
    "however , is not its deterministic character , but rather the fact that it eliminates the need for ordinary quantum theory s `` unprofessionally vague and ambiguous '' measurement axioms .",
    "@xcite instead , in the pilot - wave picture , measurements are just ordinary physical processes , obeying the same fundamental dynamical laws as other processes .",
    "in particular , nothing like the infamous `` collapse postulate ''  and the associated copenhagen notion that measurement outcomes are registered in some separately - postulated classical world  are needed .",
    "the pointers , for example , on laboratory measuring devices will end up pointing in definite directions because they are made of particles  and particles , in the pilot - wave picture , always have definite positions .    in the `` minimalist '' presentation of the pilot - wave theory ( advocated especially by j.s .",
    "bell ) , the guiding wave is simply the usual quantum mechanical wave function @xmath0 obeying the usual schrdinger equation : @xmath1 the particle position @xmath2 evolves according to @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( the usual quantum probability current ) and @xmath5 ( the usual quantum probability density ) satisfy the continuity equation @xmath6 here we consider the simplest possible case of a single spinless particle moving in one dimension .",
    "the generalizations for motion in 3d and particles with spin are trivial : @xmath7 and @xmath8 become vectors , and the wave function becomes a multi - component spinor obeying the appropriate wave equation . for a system of @xmath9 particles ,",
    "labelled @xmath10 , the generalization is also straightforward , though it should be noted that @xmath0  and consequently also @xmath11 and @xmath12  are in this case functions on the system s configuration space .",
    "the velocity of particle @xmath13 at time @xmath14 is given by the ratio @xmath15 evaluated at the complete instantaneous configuration ; thus in general the velocity of each particle depends on the instantaneous positions of all other particles .",
    "the theory is thus explicitly non - local .",
    "bell , upon noticing this surprising feature of the pilot - wave theory , was famously led to prove that such non - locality is a necessary feature of _ any _ theory sharing the empirical predictions of ordinary quantum theory .",
    "@xcite    although the fundamental dynamical laws in the pilot - wave picture are deterministic , the theory exactly reproduces the usual stochastic predictions of ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "this arises from the assumption that , although the initial _ wave function _ can be controlled by the usual experimental state - preparation techniques , the initial _ particle position _ is _ random_. in particular , for an ensemble of identically - prepared quantum systems having @xmath16 wave function @xmath17 , it is assumed that the initial particle positions @xmath18 are distributed according to @xmath19 = |\\psi(x,0)|^2 . \\label{qeh}\\ ] ] this is called the `` quantum equilibrium hypothesis '' or qeh .",
    "it is then a purely mathematical consequence of the already - postulated dynamical laws for @xmath0 and @xmath20 that the particle positions will be @xmath21 distributed for all times : @xmath22 = |\\psi(x , t)|^2 , \\label{equiv}\\ ] ] a property that has been dubbed the `` equivariance '' of the @xmath21 probability distribution .",
    "@xcite to see this , one need simply note that the probability distribution @xmath23 for an ensemble of particles moving in a velocity field @xmath24 will evolve according to @xmath25 since @xmath8 and @xmath12 satisfy the continuity equation , it is then immediately clear that , for @xmath26 , @xmath27 is a solution .",
    "properly understood , the qeh can actually be derived from the basic dynamical laws of the theory , much as the expectation that complex systems should typically be found in thermal equilibrium can be derived in classical statistical mechanics . @xcite for our purposes , though , it will be sufficient to simply take the qeh as an additional assumption , from which it follows that the pilot - wave theory will make the same predictions as ordinary quantum theory for any experiment in which the outcome is registered by the final position of the particle .",
    "that the pilot - wave theory makes the same predictions as ordinary qm for arbitrary measurements then follows from the fact that , at the end of the day , such measurement outcomes are also registered in the position of something : think , for example , of the flash on a screen somewhere behind a stern - gerlach magnet , the position of a pointer on a laboratory measuring device , or the distribution of ink droplets in _",
    "physical review_. @xcite    in the present paper , our goal is to illustrate all of these ideas by showing in concrete detail how the pilot - wave theory deals with some standard introductory textbook examples of one - dimensional quantum scattering and tunneling",
    ". this alternative perspective should be of interest to students and teachers of this material , since it provides an illuminating and compelling intuitive picture of these phenomena .",
    "in addition , because the pilot - wave theory ( for reasons we shall discuss ) forces us to remember that real particles should always be described in terms of finite - length _ wave packets _  rather than unphysical plane - waves  the methods to be developed provide a novel perspective on ordinary textbook scattering theory as well .",
    "in particular , we describe a certain limit of the usual rigorous approach to scattering @xcite in which the specifically _ conceptual _ advantages of working with normalizable wave packets can be had without any _ computational _ overhead : the relevant details about the packet shapes can be worked out , in this limit , exclusively via intuitive reasoning involving the group velocity .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review the standard textbook example of reflection and transmission at a step potential , explaining in particular why the use of plane - waves is particularly problematic in the pilot - wave picture and then indicating how the usual plane - wave calculations can be salvaged by thinking about wave packets with a certain special shape .",
    "the next section explores the pilot - wave particle trajectories in detail , showing in particular how the reflection and transmission probabilities can be computed from the properties of a certain `` critical trajectory '' @xcite that divides the possible trajectories into two classes : those that transmit and those that reflect . in the following section we turn to an analysis of quantum tunneling through a rectangular barrier from the pilot - wave perspective",
    "a brief final section summarizes the results and situates the pilot - wave theory in the context of other interpretations of the quantum formalism .",
    "let us consider the case of a particle of mass @xmath28 incident , from the left , on the step potential @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "the usual approach is to assume that we are dealing with a particle of definite energy @xmath31 ( which we assume here is @xmath32 ) in which case we can immediately write down an appropriate general solution to the time - independent schrdinger equation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath36-term represents the incident wave propagating to the right toward the barrier .",
    "the @xmath37-term represents a reflected wave propagating back out to the left .",
    "the @xmath38-term represents a transmitted wave .",
    "and there is , by assumption , no incoming ( i.e. , leftward - propagating ) wave to the right of the barrier .",
    "the transmission and reflection probabilities depend on the relative amplitudes ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ) of the incident , reflected , and transmitted waves . by imposing continuity of @xmath39 and its derivative at @xmath40 (",
    "these conditions being required in order that the above @xmath39 satisfy the schrdinger equation _ at _",
    "@xmath40 ) one easily finds that @xmath41 and @xmath42 a typical textbook approach is then to calculate the probability current in each region .",
    "plugging equation into equation gives @xmath43 which can be interpreted as follows .",
    "for @xmath44 there is both an incoming probability flux proportional to @xmath45 and an outgoing flux proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "the reflection probability @xmath47 can be defined as the ratio of these , so @xmath48 similarly , for @xmath49 , there is an outgoing probability flux proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "the transmission probability @xmath51 can be defined as the ratio of this flux to the incident flux , so @xmath52 this approach to calculating @xmath53 and @xmath51 is however somewhat unintuitive , in so far as the wave function involved is a stationary state .",
    "this makes it far from obvious how to understand the mathematics as describing an actual physical process , unfolding in time , in which a particle , initially incident toward the barrier , either transmits or reflects .",
    "the situation is even more problematic , though , from the point of view of the pilot - wave theory . here",
    ", the particle is supposed to have some definite position at all times , with a velocity given by equation .",
    "but , with the wave function as given by equation , the probability current @xmath8 for @xmath44 is positive ( since @xmath54 ) . and",
    "of course @xmath12 is positive .",
    "so it follows immediately that , in the pilot - wave picture , the particle velocity is necessarily positive : if the particle is in the region @xmath44 , it will be moving to the right , toward the barrier .",
    "it can not possibly reflect !",
    "it is easy to see , however , that this is an artifact of the use of unphysical ( unnormalizable ) plane - wave states .",
    "many introductory textbooks mention in passing the possibility of instead using finite wave packets to analyze scattering .",

    "some texts go a little further into this `` messy business '' and treat the problem of an incident ( typically , gaussian ) packet in some analytic detail .",
    "@xcite    and the need to examine scattering in terms of ( finite , normalizable ) wave packets has long been recognized in the pilot - wave literature , which has included for example numerical studies of trajectories for gaussian packets incident on various barriers .",
    "@xcite the use of gaussian packets , however , tends to obscure the relationship to the standard textbook plane - wave calculation .",

    ", the complicated structure of the wave function during the scattering of the packet gives rise to equally complicated particle trajectories .",
    "so although one of course knows based on equation that the ensemble of possible particle trajectories will `` follow '' @xmath55 , it is impossible to independently _ verify _ this without turning the problem over to a computer .    in the next section , we will develop a simple way to verify that , indeed , just the right fraction of the possible particle trajectories end up in the reflected and transmitted packets . to lay the ground for this ,",
    "let us turn now to setting up a simple approach to reconciling the plane - wave and wave packet approaches .",
    "this should be of pedagogical interest even to those with no particular interest in the pilot - wave theory . to be clear , what follows is in no sense intended as a replacement for ordinary scattering theory .",
    "@xcite the point is merely to show how , by considering incident packets with a particular special shape , the reflection and transmission probabilities can be read off in a trivial way from the packet amplitudes and widths .",
    "consider then an incident wave packet @xmath56 with a reasonably sharply - defined wave number @xmath57 , but with a special , non - gaussian , envelope profile @xmath58 .",
    "in particular , we imagine @xmath58 to be nearly _ constant _ over a spatial region of length @xmath59 , and zero outside this region .",
    "then , as long as the ( central ) wavelength @xmath60 is very small compared to @xmath59 ( actually , it should in addition be small compared to the length scale over which @xmath61 transitions to zero at the edges of the packet ) the envelope function @xmath61 will maintain its shape and simply drift at the appropriate group velocity . let us call this type of packet a `` plane - wave packet '' ; its conceptual and analytical merit lies in the fact that , where it does nt vanish , it is well - approximated by a plane wave .",
    "@xcite    in terms of such plane - wave packets , the scattering process can be understood as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "let us choose @xmath16 to be the time when the leading edge of the incident packet arrives at @xmath40 .",
    "the incident packet has length @xmath59 and moves at the group velocity @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the packet s trailing edge arrives at the origin at @xmath63 .",
    "the whole scattering process then naturally breaks up into the following three time periods :    1 .",
    "for @xmath64 the incident packet is propagating toward the barrier at @xmath40 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath65 the wave function in some ( initially small",
    ", then bigger , then small again ) region around @xmath40 is well - approximated by the plane - wave expressions of equation .",
    "3 .   for @xmath66",
    "the incident packet has completely disappeared and there are reflected and transmitted packets propagating away from the barrier on either side .",
    "it is now possible to understand the usual reflection and transmission probabilities in a remarkably simple way . to begin with",
    ", the incident packet should be properly normalized .",
    "since it goes as @xmath67 over a region of length @xmath59 , it is clear that @xmath68 the total probability associated with the reflected packet can be found by multiplying its probability density @xmath69 by its length .",
    "since the leading and trailing edges of the reflected packet are produced respectively when the leading and trailing edges of the incident packet arrive at the barrier  and since the reflected packet propagates in the same region as the incident packet so their group velocities are the same  the reflected packet has the same length , @xmath59 , as the incident packet .",
    "hence @xmath70 where in the last step we have used equation to relate the amplitude @xmath37 of the reflected packet to the amplitude @xmath36 of the incident one .",
    "the result here is of course in agreement with equation .",
    "the transmission probability can be calculated in a similar way .",
    "but here it is crucial to recognize that the group velocity for the @xmath49 region , @xmath71 , is _ smaller _ than the group velocity in the @xmath44 region .",
    "thus , the position of the leading edge of the transmitted packet when the trailing edge is created at @xmath40 , i.e. , the length of the transmitted packet , is only @xmath72 that is , the transmitted packet is _ shorter _ , by a factor @xmath73 , than the incident and reflected packets .",
    "the total probability carried by the transmitted packet is then easily seen to be @xmath74 again in agreement with the earlier result .",
    "note though , on this analysis , how the perhaps - puzzling factor of @xmath75 in equation admits an intuitively clear origin in the relative lengths of the incident and transmitted packets .    even in the context of conventional , textbook quantum theory",
    ", the `` plane - wave packet '' approach has several pedagogical merits .",
    "first , it allows the scattering process to be understood and visualized as a genuine , time - dependent process .",
    "second , the reflection and transmission probabilities can be calculated without recourse to the somewhat cryptic and somewhat hand - waving device of taking ratios of certain hand - picked terms from the probability currents on each side . and finally , the explicit discussion of wave packets helps make clear that the results of the calculation  in particular the expressions for @xmath53 and @xmath51  can be expected to be accurate only under the conditions ( e.g. , @xmath76 ) assumed in the derivation . and",
    "of course the over - arching point is that all of this is accomplished while still using the mathematically simple plane - wave calculations : there is no particularly `` messy business '' and no need `` to turn the problem over to a computer . ''    in the following section , we will see the particular utility of the `` plane - wave packet '' approach in the context of the alternative pilot - wave picture .",
    "in the pilot - wave theory , the particle velocity is determined by the structure of the wave function in the vicinity of the particle , according to equation . by considering a plane - wave packet as discussed in the previous section",
    ", we can see that there are several possible regions in which the particle may find itself .",
    "let us consider these in turn .    to begin with , initially , the particle will be at some ( random ) location in the incident packet .",
    "since , by assumption , the packet length @xmath59 is very large compared to the length scale associated with the packet s leading and trailing edges , the particle is overwhelmingly likely to be at a location where the wave function in its immediate vicinity is given by @xmath77 ( here and subsequently we omit for simplicity the time - dependent phase of the wave function , which plays no role . )",
    "it follows immediately that the particle s velocity is @xmath78 note that this is the same as the group velocity of the incident packet .",
    "thus , the particle will approach the barrier with the incident packet , indeed keeping its same position relative to the front and rear of the packet as both things ( the wave and the particle ) move .    at some point  the exact time and place depending on its random initial position within the incident packet  the particle will encounter the leading edge of the reflected packet .",
    "it will then begin to move through the `` overlap region '' where both the incident and reflected waves are present : @xmath79 its velocity in this overlap region will be given by @xmath80 where @xmath61 is the complex phase of @xmath37 relative to @xmath36  zero in the case at hand . here",
    "the right hand side is to be evaluated at each moment at the instantaneous location of the particle .",
    "this first - order differential equation for @xmath2 is easily solved ",
    "more precisely , it is trivial to write an exact expression for @xmath81  but it is already clear from the above expression that the particle s velocity will oscillate around an average `` drift '' value given by @xmath82 since we are assuming that the packet length @xmath83 , the particle s velocity will ( with overwhelming probability ) oscillate above and below this average value many many times while it moves through the overlap region .",
    "it is thus an excellent approximation to simply ignore the oscillations and treat the particle as moving through the overlap region with a constant velocity @xmath84 .",
    "there are two possible ways for the particle to escape from the overlap region .",
    "if it arrives at the origin , it will cross over into the region where only the transmitted wave @xmath85 is present .",
    "it will then continue to move to the right with a velocity @xmath86 matching the group velocity of the transmitted packet .",
    "the other possibility is that , while still in the overlap region , the trailing edge of the incident packet catches and surpasses the particle .",
    "it will then subsequently be guided exclusively by the reflected wave @xmath87 its velocity @xmath88 will match that of the reflected wave packet , with which it will propagate back out to the left .    it is helpful to visualize the family of possible particle trajectories on a space - time diagram ; see figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "notice that a particle which happens to begin near the leading edge of the incident packet will definitely transmit , while particles beginning nearer the trailing edge of the incident packet will definitely reflect .",
    "although the dynamics here is completely deterministic , the theory makes statistical predictions because the initial position of a particular particle within its guiding wave is uncontrollable and unpredictable .",
    "recall the `` quantum equilibrium hypothesis '' ( qeh ) according to which , for an ensemble of identically - prepared systems with initial wave function @xmath17 , the initial particle positions will be random , with distribution given by equation .",
    "it then follows , from the `` equivariance '' property described in the introduction , that @xmath55 will continue to describe the particles probability distribution for all @xmath14 .",
    "the pilot - wave theory thus reproduces the exact statistical predictions of ordinary qm , but without any further axioms about measurement : whereas in ordinary qm , for example , the transmission probability @xmath51 ( equal to the integral of @xmath12 across the transmitted packet ) represents only the probability that the particle will appear there if a measurement is made , in the pilot - wave theory @xmath51 instead represents the probability that the particle _ really is there _ in the transmitted packet , ready to trigger a `` click '' in a detector should such a device happen to be present .    as a concrete illustration of the equivariance property that guarantees the equivalence between the pilot - wave theory s statistical predictions and those of ordinary quantum theory ,",
    "let us derive the reflection and transmission probabilities directly from the particle trajectories and show that we indeed arrive again at the same expressions we found before by considering only the quantum wave .",
    "the key here is to examine in particular the `` critical trajectory '' which divides those trajectories which result in transmission , from those which result in reflection .",
    "this critical trajectory , by definition , arrives just at the apex of the triangular overlap region of figure [ fig2 ] : particles on the leading - edge side of the critical trajectory will necessarily transmit , while particles on the trailing - edge side of the critical trajectory will necessarily reflect .",
    "a zoomed - in image of the overlap region from figure [ fig2 ] is shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "as explained in the caption , the critical trajectory moves through the overlap region across a distance @xmath89 where @xmath51 is the transmission probability .",
    "it does this in a time @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "it follows that the ( average ) velocity through the overlap region is @xmath93 equating this with the expression for the velocity in the overlap region worked out in equation gives @xmath94 which can be solved for @xmath51 to give @xmath95 using equation to put this in terms of the wave numbers @xmath57 and @xmath96 of course gives back precisely equation for the transmission probability . and",
    "since @xmath97 , equation is also implied again by the properties of the critical trajectory .",
    "it is of course no surprise that we arrive at the same expressions for the transmission and reflection probabilities by considering the pilot - wave expression for the particle velocity in , especially , the crucial overlap region .",
    "but it is a clarifying confirmation of the sense in which the wave and particle evolutions are _ consistent _ as expressed in the equivariance property .",
    "to illustrate the more general applicability of the methods developed in the previous sections , let us analyze another standard textbook example  the tunneling of a particle through a classically forbidden region  from the pilot - wave perspective .",
    "let the potential be given by @xmath98 and let the particle , with a reasonably sharply defined energy @xmath99 , be incident from the left .",
    "as before , we take the initial wave function @xmath17 to be a plane - wave packet with ( central ) wavelength @xmath60 ( with @xmath34 ) and length @xmath76 . in addition , we assume here that the packet length @xmath59 is much greater than the width @xmath100 of the potential energy barrier",
    ". then  letting now @xmath101  the wave function in the vicinity of the barrier will be given by @xmath102 for the overwhelming majority of the time when @xmath39 near the barrier is nonzero .",
    "( in particular , @xmath39 will differ substantially from the above expressions just when the leading edge of the incident packet first arrives at the barrier , and again when the trailing edge arrives there . but this will have negligible effect on our analysis since the probability for the particle to be too near the leading or trailing edges will be , for very large @xmath59 , very small . )    imposing the usual continuity conditions on @xmath39 and its first derivative at @xmath40 and @xmath103 gives a set of four algebraic conditions on the amplitudes @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 . eliminating @xmath38 and @xmath104 allows the amplitudes of the reflected ( @xmath37 ) and transmitted ( @xmath105 ) packets to be written in terms of the amplitude @xmath36 of the incident packet : @xmath106 and @xmath107 since the packet that develops on the downstream side of the barrier moves with the same group velocity as the incident packet , the transmitted packet length matches the incident packet length .",
    "the total probability associated with the transmitted packet  the `` tunneling probability ''  is thus @xmath108 with the corresponding reflection probability being @xmath109 as before ,",
    "these results can be understood in terms of the particle trajectories as well . in general",
    "the trajectories are very similar to those from the earlier example .",
    "while the incident and reflected packets are both present to the left of the barrier , an overlap region is set up in which the motion of the incoming particle is slowed .",
    "the particle velocity in this region is again described by equation , although now there is a nontrivial complex phase between the amplitudes @xmath37 and @xmath36 : @xmath110 the average drift velocity through the overlap region , however , remains as in equation , so the analysis surrounding figure [ fig3 ] still applies and we have again that the transmission ( or here , tunneling ) probability as determined by the critical trajectory is @xmath111 in agreement with the result arrived at by considering just the waves .",
    "this again confirms that the distribution of possible particle trajectories evolves in concert with the wave intensity @xmath12 such that equation remains true at all times .",
    "the nature of the pilot - wave theory particle trajectories in the classically - forbidden region ( cfr ) is of some interest .",

    "figure [ fig4 ] displays the behavior of a representative sample of particle trajectories .",
    "the overall pattern is similar to the case of scattering from the step potential : particles that begin near the trailing edge of the incident packet will be swept up by the reflected packet before reaching @xmath40 , while those which begin nearer the leading edge of the incident packet will reach the barrier , tunnel across it , and emerge with the transmitted packet .",
    "we have analyzed two standard textbook cases of one - dimensional quantum mechanical scattering and tunneling from the point of view of the de broglie - bohm pilot - wave theory .",
    "in particular , we have shown how the standard textbook expressions for the reflection and transmission / tunneling probabilities  calculated using infinitely - extended plane - wave states  can instead be understood as arising from a certain type of idealized , non - gaussian incident wave packet .",
    "we then took advantage of this `` plane - wave packet '' approach to generate a tractable , indeed quite simple , picture of how the particle trajectories in the pilot - wave theory develop .",
    "it is hoped that the plane - wave packet approach might prove clarifying for students learning standard textbook quantum mechanics .",
    "it is also hoped that introducing the pilot - wave theory through standard textbook examples will make it easier for teachers to present the range of available interpretive options clearly and effectively to students .",
    "recent work has shown that modern physics students have particular difficulty with conceptual questions involving issues of interpretation @xcite  a finding that is hardly surprising given that physics teachers themselves have divergent views on interpretive questions and their place in the curriculum .",
    "@xcite these questions deserve to be discussed more explicitly and more carefully , and it seems natural to do so in the context of the kinds of example problems that students encounter in such courses anyway .    despite its not being suggested as an option in the textbook or lectures , several of the students interviewed in ref .",

    "the theory has indeed been presented in such a form by bohm and others . @xcite but as the examples in the body of the present work should help make clear , this is an entirely unnecessary addition to the `` minimalist '' pilot - wave theory , in which the field guiding the particle is none other than the usual quantum mechanical wave function obeying the usual schrdinger equation .",
    "the second factor typically cited by critics of the pilot - wave theory is its non - local character and the associated alleged incompatibility with relativity .",
    "it is true , as discussed just after equation above , that the pilot - wave theory is explicitly non - local . what the critics forget , however , is that ordinary quantum mechanics is also a non - local theory : already in its account of the simple one - particle scattering phenomena discussed here , orthodox quantum theory needs additional postulates  in particular the infamous and manifestly non - local _ collapse postulate _",

    "the truth is that , as we know from bell , no local theory can be empirically adequate .",
    "@xcite so rejecting candidate interpretations on the basis of their non - local character is hardly appropriate . nevertheless , it is interesting that the conventional wisdom on this point is completely backwards : the pilot - wave theory is actually _ less _ non - local than ordinary quantum theory in the sense that it ( unlike the orthodox theory ) can at least account for the results of one - particle scattering / tunneling / interference experiments in a completely local way .",
    "it is thus hoped not only that the examples presented here will provide a simple concrete way for the alternative pilot - wave picture to be introduced to students , but also that the examples will help overturn some unfortunate and widely - held misconceptions about the theory .",
    "and of course it should be noted that the pilot - wave theory is just one of several alternatives to the usual copenhagen - inspired theory that appears in most textbooks .",
    "there is , for example , also the many - worlds ( `` everettian '' ) theory , the spontaneous collapse ( `` grw '' ) theory , the consistent ( or decoherent ) histories approach , and many others . as someone who thinks that these questions  about the _ physics _ behind the quantum formalism  are meaningful , important , fascinating , controversial , and too - often hidden under a shroud of unspeakability , i would like to see all of these interpretations more widely understood and discussed by physicists , both in and out of the classroom .",
