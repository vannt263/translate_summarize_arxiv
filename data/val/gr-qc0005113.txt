    "<S> we reinvestigate the utility of time - independent constant mean curvature foliations for the numerical simulation of a single spherically - symmetric black hole . </S>",
    "<S> each spacelike hypersurface of such a foliation is endowed with the same constant value of the trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> of the three families of @xmath0-constant surfaces possible ( classified according to their asymptotic behaviors ) , we single out a sub - family of singularity - avoiding surfaces that may be particularly useful , and provide an analytic expression for the closest approach such surfaces make to the singularity . </S>",
    "<S> we then utilize a non - zero shift to yield families of @xmath0-constant surfaces which ( 1 ) avoid the black hole singularity , and thus the need to excise the singularity , ( 2 ) are asymptotically null , aiding in gravity wave extraction , ( 3 ) cover the physically relevant part of the spacetime , ( 4 ) are well behaved ( regular ) across the horizon , and ( 5 ) are static under evolution , and therefore have no `` grid stretching / sucking '' pathologies . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary numerical runs demonstrate that we can stably evolve a single spherically - symmetric static black hole using this foliation . </S>",
    "<S> we wish to emphasize that this coordinatization produces @xmath0-constant surfaces for a single black hole spacetime that are regular , static and stable throughout their evolution . </S>"
