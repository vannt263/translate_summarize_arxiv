    "we consider the _ thinnest path _ problem in wireless ad hoc networks . for a given source and a destination , the thinnest path problem asks for a path from the source to the destination that results in the minimum number of nodes hearing the message .",
    "such a path is achieved by carefully choosing a sequence of relaying nodes and their corresponding transmission power .    at the first glance",
    ", one may wonder whether the thinnest path problem is simply a shortest path problem with the weight of each hop given by the number of nodes that hear the message in this hop . realizing that a node may be within the transmission range of multiple relaying nodes and",
    "should not be counted multiple times in the total weight ( referred to as the width ) of the resulting path , we see that the thinnest path problem does not have a simple cost function that is summable over edges .",
    "but rather , the width of a path is given by the cardinality of the _ union _ of all receiving nodes in each hop , which is a highly nonlinear function of the weight of each hop .",
    "one may then wonder whether we can redefine the weight of each hop as the number of nodes that hear the message for the first time .",
    "such a definition of edge weight indeed leads to a summable cost function .",
    "unfortunately , in this case , the edge weight can not be predetermined until the thinnest path from the source to the edge in question has already been established .",
    "a more fundamental difference between the thinnest path and the shortest path problems is that the thinnest path from a single source to all other nodes in the network do not form a tree . in other words ,",
    "the thinnest path to a node does not necessarily go through the thinnest path to any of its neighbors .",
    "the loss of the tree structure is one of the main reasons that the thinnest path problem is much more complex than the shortest path problem . indeed , as shown in this paper , the thinnest path problem is np - complete , which is in sharp contrast with the polynomial nature of the shortest path problem .",
    "another aspect that complicates the problem is the choice of the transmission power at each node ( within a maximum value that may vary across nodes ) . in this case",
    ", the network can not be modeled as a simple graph in which the neighbors of each node are prefixed . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the _ directed hypergraph _ model which easily captures the choice of different neighbor sets at each node . while a graph is given by a vertex set @xmath2 and an edge set @xmath3 consisting of cardinality-2 subsets of @xmath2 , a hypergraph  @xcite is free of the constraint on the cardinality of an edge",
    "specifically , any non - empty subset of @xmath2 can be an element ( referred to as a hyperedge ) of the edge set @xmath3 .",
    "hypergraphs can thus capture group behaviors and higher - dimensional relationships in complex networks that are more than a simple union of pairwise relationships . in a directed hypergraph  , each hyperedge",
    "is directed , going from a source vertex to a non - empty set of destination vertices .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : hypergraph]-(a ) where we have @xmath4 directed hyperedges rooted at a source node @xmath5 with each hyperedge modeling a neighbor set of @xmath5 under a specific power .",
    "the directed hypergraph model of the thinnest path problem is thus readily seen : rooted at each node are multiple directed hyperedges , each corresponding to a distinct neighbor set feasible under the maximum transmission power of this node .",
    "the problem is then to find a minimum - width hyperpath from the source to the destination where the width of a hyperpath is given by the cardinality of the union of the hyperedges on this hyperpath .",
    "based on the directed hypergraph formulation , we show that the thinnest path problem in @xmath4-d networks is np - complete even under a simple disk propagation model .",
    "this result is established through a reduction from the minimum dominating set problem in graphs , a classic np - complete problem .",
    "the most challenging part of this reduction is to show the reduced problem is realizable under a 2-d disk model .",
    "we further establish that even with a fixed transmission power at each node ( in this case , the resulting hypergraph degenerates to a standard graph ) , the thinnest path problem is np - complete .",
    "we then propose two polynomial - time approximation algorithms that offer @xmath0 and @xmath1 approximation ratios for general directed hypergraphs ( which can model non - isomorphic signal propagation in space ) and constant approximation ratios for ring hypergraphs ( which result from isomorphic signal propagation ) .",
    "we also establish the polynomial nature of the problem in 1-d and 1.5-d networks , where a 1.5-d network is a 1-d network embedded in a 2-d field of eavesdroppers with arbitrary unknown locations .",
    "we propose an algorithm based on a nested backward induction ( nbi ) starting at the destination .",
    "we show that this nbi algorithm has @xmath6 time complexity . since the size of the input date is @xmath6 , the proposed algorithm is order optimal .",
    "it solves the thinnest path problem in both the 1-d and 1.5-d networks .",
    "in particular , no algorithm , even with the complete location information of the eavesdroppers , can obtain a thinner path than the nbi algorithm which does not require the knowledge of eavesdropper locations .",
    "there is a large body of literature on security issues in wireless ad hoc networks ( see , for example , ) .",
    "however , the thinnest path problem has not been studied in the literature except in .",
    "chechik studied the thinnest path ( referred to as the secluded path in  ) and the thinnest steiner tree in graphs .",
    "they showed that the problem in a general graph is np - complete and strongly inapproximable .",
    "they proposed an approximation algorithm with an approximation ratio of @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the maximum degree of the graph .",
    "they further studied the problem in several special graph models including graphs with bounded degree , hereditary graphs , and planar graphs .",
    "however , their study focuses on the problem in topological graphs , whereas we focus on hypergraphs and geometric graphs .",
    "the results obtained in   do not apply to special hypergraphs satisfying certain geometric properties that result naturally from the communication problem studied in this paper .",
    "this paper also includes several new results on the thinnest path problem under the graph model . specifically , we established the np - completeness of the problem in @xmath4-d disk graphs and @xmath9-d unit disk graphs . the results in   and",
    "this work thus complement each other to provide a more complete picture of the thinnest path problem under different ( hyper)graph models .    in the general context of algorithmic studies in hypergraphs ,",
    "ausiello  @xcite tackled the problem of finding the @xmath10-optimal hyperpath where @xmath10 is a general measure on hyperpaths that satisfies a certain monotone property .",
    "they established the np - completeness of this problem for general measures .",
    "the thinnest path problem can be seen as an @xmath10-optimal traversal problem with the measure @xmath10 given by the number of vertices covered by the path .",
    "since it is a special measure , their np - completeness result developed under general measures does not apply .",
    "furthermore , in many applications , the resulting hypergraphs have certain topological and/or geometrical properties , and the computational complexities under these special models require separate analysis .",
    "another realated problem is the shortest path problem in hypergraphs .",
    "the shortest path problem in hypergraphs remains a polynomial - time problem as its counterpart under the graph model .",
    "the static shortest hyperpath problem was considered by knuth  @xcite and gallo   in which dijkstra s algorithm for graph was extended to obtain the shortest hyperpaths .",
    "ausiello proposed a dynamic shortest hyperpath algorithm for directed hypergraphs , considering only the incremental problem ( network changes contain only edge insertion and weight decrease ) with the weights of all hyperedges limited to a finite set of numbers  @xcite . in",
    ", gao developed the first fully dynamic shortest path algorithms for general hypergraphs .",
    "as discussed in  [ sec : intro - thinnest ] , the thinnest path problem is fundamentally different and significantly more complex than the shortest path problem .",
    "the widest path problem has been well studied under the graph model@xcite , and the existing results can be easily extended to hypergraphs .",
    "the widest path problem asks for a path whose minimum edge weight along the path is maximized . in other words ,",
    "the width of a path is given by the minimum edge weight on that path , which is different from the definition of path width in the thinnest path problem studied in this paper . as a consequence ,",
    "the widest path problem is not the complement of the thinnest path problem .",
    "since the tree structure is preserved in the widest path problem ( the widest path to a node must go through the widest path to one of its neighbors ) , it remains a polynomial time problem .",
    "the thinnest path problem , however , is np - complete in general .",

    "specifically , the hyperedges rooted at each node can be ordered in such a way ( say , @xmath30 ) that @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this is due to the nature of wireless broadcasting where nodes reachable under transmission power @xmath33 can also be reached under any power greater than @xmath33 . under an isomorphic propagation model , we end up with a disk hypergraph .",
    "if all nodes have the same maximum range , we have a unit disk hypergraph .",
    "this hypergraph model also applies to networks with eavesdroppers .",
    "each eavesdropper can be seen as a node with zero transmission range .",
    "it is thus a vertex with no outgoing hyperedges .",

    "in this section , we show that the thinnest path ( tp ) problem is np - complete in several special geometric hypergraphs and graphs . this implies the np - completeness of the problem in general directed hypergraphs .      in this subsection , we prove the np - completeness of the thinnest path problem in @xmath4-d disk hypergraphs .",
    "while a stronger result is shown in the next subsection , the proof of this result provides the main building block for the proof of the next result .",
    "the result is established through a reduction from the maximum dominating set ( mds ) problem .",
    "the mds problem asks for the minimum subset of vertices in a given graph such that every vertex in the graph is either in the subset or a direct neighbor of one vertex in the subset .",
    "the following theorem formally establishes the polynomial reduction ( denoted by @xmath48 ) from mds to tp in @xmath4-d disk hypergraphs .",
    "since the thinnest path problem is clearly in the np space , this theorem establishes the np - completeness of tp in 2-d disk hypergraphs .",

    "there are two main difficulties .",
    "first , line crossing is inevitable when we draw @xmath50 on a 2-d plane .",
    "the implementation of hyperedges that cross each other needs special care to avoid unwanted overhearing that may render the reduction invalid .",
    "second , the geometric structure of 2-d disk hypergraphs dictates that there are at most 5 vertices ( even with arbitrary ranges ) that can reach a common sixth vertex but not each other .",
    "it is thus challenging to implement a vertex with up to @xmath29 incoming hyperedges in @xmath50 while preserving the reduction .",
    "our main approach to the above difficulties is to allow _ directed _ overhearing .",
    "specifically , messages transmitted along one hyperedge may be heard by vertices implementing another hyperedge in @xmath50 , but not vise verse . by carefully choosing the directions of the introduced overhearing ,",
    "we ensure that the resulting 2-d disk hypergraph @xmath51 , while having a different topological structure from @xmath50 , preserves the reduction from mds in  @xmath49 .",
    "another challenge in constructing @xmath51 is to ensure the polynomial nature of the reduction .",
    "the number of additional vertices added in @xmath51 needs to be in a polynomial order with the size of @xmath49 .",
    "this often limits using reduced transmission ranges as a way to avoid unwanted overhearing : exponentially small transmission ranges may require exponentially many vertices to connect two fixed points .    a detailed proof is given in [ app : np_2ddh ] .",
    "we now establish the np - completeness of tp in 2-d _ unit _ disk hypergraphs ( udh ) .",
    "the proof builds upon the proof of theorem  [ thm : np-2ddh ] .",

    "given the same set of vertices and their associated maximum ranges , a disk hypergraph has a different topology from a disk graph : each vertex in general has more than one outgoing hyperedges due to the freedom of using smaller transmission ranges . the same holds for udh and udg . as a consequence",

    "[ thm : np_2ddg ]    in the proof of theorem  [ thm : np-2ddh ] , the vertices along the thinnest path in the constructed 2-d disk hypergraph @xmath51 all use their maximum ranges .",

    "next we consider tp in udg .",
    "unfortunately , the approach through exposed disk hypergraphs used in showing the np - completeness of tp in udh does not apply , since it hinges on vertices being able to use any transmission ranges smaller than a maximum value .",
    "the difficulty , however , can be circumvented for 3-d udg as shown in the following theorem .",
    "mds in degree-@xmath9 graphs @xmath48 tp in @xmath9-d udg .",
    "[ thm : np_3dudg ]    the proof is similar to that of theorem  [ thm : np-2ddh ] with two main differences .",
    "first , line crosses are implemented by using the third dimension to `` go around '' , rather than using different transmission ranges ( a luxury absent in udg ) to create directed crosses .",
    "second , reduction from mds in graphs with a maximum degree of @xmath9 ensures that there are at most @xmath65 incoming edges to each super vertex in the reduced udg .",
    "this makes the geometric constraint on the number ( at most @xmath66 in a @xmath9-d euclidean space ) of vertices that can reach a common vertex but not each other inconsequential ( see [ app : np_3dudg ] ) . ] . a detailed proof is given in [ app : np_3dudg ] .",
    "note that using a reduction from mds in graphs with a constant maximum degree rather than mds in general graphs leads to a weaker statement .",
    "while mds in both cases are np - complete , the former is approximable with a constant ratio , and the latter a ratio of @xmath67 .",
