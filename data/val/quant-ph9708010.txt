    "schrodinger @xcite attempted to construct wave packets for the hydrogen atom that were related to classical orbits .",
    "such a construction was easy for the harmonic oscillator , and these are the well known coherent states @xcite@xcite .",
    "the hydrogen atom , however , proved to be more difficult and the question was not resolved at that time .",
    "the issue has become relevant again in connection with the rydberg atoms @xcite in microwave cavities .",
    "various considerations have led to different proposals @xcite for the coherent states of the hydrogen atom .",
    "some used the dynamical groups so(4 ) or so(4,2 ) .",
    "however , a state of the class did not go into a state of the same class under time evolution .",
    "klauder @xcite has constructed coherent states with the property that under time evolution these remain coherent states .",
    "recently one of us @xcite constructed a set of coherent states for the anharmonic oscillator which was unique when precise connection to the classical phase space and dynamics was demanded .",
    "we construct wave packets for the hydrogen atom labelled by classical phase space variables .",
    "@xmath0 the definition of these variables and their relation to the classical orbit is explained later .",
    "the angle variable @xmath1 now has the range @xmath2 .",
    "note that only the bound state spectrum has been used .",
    "wave packets built out of scattering states with similar properties can also be constructed using our techniques , but will not be considered here .",
    "we have the resolution of identity in the subspace of the hilbert space spanned by the bound states ,    @xmath3\\!d\\theta \\int_{-1}^{1}\\!d((j+1/2)\\hbar\\ , cos\\,\\beta ) \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}d\\alpha \\int_{-1}^{1}\\!d((j+1/2)\\hbar\\ , cos\\,\\delta ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{2in}\\times \\int_{0}^{2\\pi } d\\gamma |   r,\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma,\\delta,\\theta\\rangle \\langle r,\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma,\\delta,\\theta | \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4d\\theta \\equiv \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty }   \\frac{1}{n } \\int_{-n\\pi}^{n\\pi}d\\theta.\\ ] ] this corresponds to averaging over an infinite number of classical orbits .",
    "the measure is exactly the classical phase space measure invariant under canonical transformations . under time evolution , @xmath5 correspondence to the kepler problem ------------------------------------    the bound state kepler problem",
    "is conveniently described @xcite by three action variables @xmath6 and their corresponding angle variables @xmath7 .",
    "( these are related to the variables in ref @xcite through @xmath8 . )",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath9 involves only @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 @xmath12 is the magnitude of the total angular momentum , and @xmath13 is the z component of the angular momentum .",
    "the angle variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 are also constants of motion in this problem because their corresponding frequencies are zero . only @xmath16 changes in time as @xmath17 where t(r ) is the time period of the orbit .",
    "it has been observed in @xcite@xcite that the time evolution in equation ( 4 ) is possible only if the angle variable @xmath16 is extended to the covering space ; @xmath18 this is because the energy levels are incommensurate .",
    "after one period the wave packet is not reproduced , though grossly it has the same features .",
    "this uniquely fixes the dependence on @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath19 under rotation we require these wave packets to go into one another as these labels do .",
    "@xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath16 do not change under rotation of axes . )",
    "@xmath14 is the angle between the y axis and the line of nodes .",
    "( i.e. the line of intersection between the orbital plane and the x - y plane . )",
    "@xmath15 is the angle between the line of nodes and the major axis ( fig 1 ) .",
    "also @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the inclination of the orbit .",
    "( i.e. the angle between the normal @xmath24 to the orbit and the z axis . )",
    "thus under rotation of the orbit around the z axis ( by angle @xmath25 ) , @xmath14 increases by @xmath25 while @xmath15 and @xmath23 do not change .",
    "this uniquely requires the dependence on @xmath14 to involve @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the generator of rotations about the z axis . a rotation about the line of nodes by an angle @xmath28 increases @xmath23 by @xmath28 while keeping @xmath14 and @xmath15 unchanged .",
    "this fixes the dependence on @xmath23 and @xmath14 so that it involves @xmath29 .",
    "this is because the rotation about line of nodes corresponds to @xmath30 .",
    "finally a rotation about the normal @xmath31 by angle @xmath28 increases @xmath15 by @xmath28 while keeping the other two angles constant .",
    "this rotation corresponds to @xmath32 therefore the dependence on @xmath33 is required to be @xmath34 note that this rotation precisely corresponds to taking an orbit in the x - y plane with the major axis along the x direction into the orbit labelled by @xmath35 .    we may exploit the dynamical o(4 ) symmetry of the hydrogen atom to fix the dependence on @xmath12 also .",
    "in addition to the conserved vector * j * related to rotational invariance , we have another conserved vector * k * along the major axis ( fig 2 . )",
    "related to the laplace runge lenz vector .",
    "we have @xmath36 , @xmath37 and the eccentricity of the orbit is @xmath38 .",
    "the role of the vector * k * is to deform the orbits by changing @xmath12 .",
    "the o(4 ) symmetry corresponds to independent rotations of the vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the 3-dimensional space .    consider a circular orbit in the x - y plane .",
    "now @xmath41 and @xmath42 are in the z direction .",
    "imagine a rotation of @xmath39 about the 2-axis by an angle @xmath43 and an equal and opposite rotation of @xmath40 .",
    "this will give a non zero @xmath44 of magnitude @xmath45 along the x direction and @xmath46 of magnitude @xmath47 along the z direction .",
    "thus the orbit has been deformed into an elliptic orbit in the x - y plane with @xmath48 .",
    "the above analysis shows the following . in order to have the right transformation properties of the classical variables @xmath49 under the full o(4 ) symmetry",
    ", the dependence on @xmath50 has to be via @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "classically this will rotate and deform a circular orbit in the x - y plane into the orbit with the labels @xmath35 ( without changing the size of the major axis ) .",
    "quantum mechanically the former corresponds to the state @xmath54 .",
    "therefore we may expect the coherent state to have the form @xmath55 with a proper choice of @xmath56 this will have the properties we require .",
    "however we find that it is much more natural and convenient to use a different set of action angle variables .",
    "note the close relation to the angular momentum coherent states .",
    "note also that the angle variables @xmath57 are involved in rotation about the third axis whereas the angles @xmath23 and @xmath43 related to the action variables are involved in rotation about the one and two axes .",
    "this is a general feature as seen below .",
    "consider a spinning object with spin quantum number j and gyromagnetic ratio @xmath58 in an external magnetic field b in the z direction .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath59 .",
    "classically the spin will precess about the z axis with frequency @xmath60 .",
    "the action variable is @xmath61 which measures the inclination to the z axis and the angle variable @xmath62 , is the azimuthal angle of the precessing spin .",
    "we now show that , by requiring classical time evolution , semi - classical limit and correct rotation property for the states @xmath63 labelled by the classical phase space of this system , we obtain uniquely the angular momentum coherent states @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath64 to reproduce the classical evolution , @xmath65 under rotation by angle @xmath66 about the x axis , @xmath67 goes to @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the classical spin to be associated to the spin quantum number @xmath71 .",
    "in order that @xmath72 have this property , we have to choose @xmath73 as seen below . note that we have precisely got the angular momentum coherent state labelled by @xmath67 and @xmath1 .",
    "we now show that this has the right semi classical limit and resolution of identity @xmath74 for large @xmath71 , @xmath75 peaks at @xmath76 i.e. the dominant contributions come from the states @xmath77 .    as @xmath61 and @xmath1 are action angle variables , the phase space measure is @xmath78 .",
    "now @xmath79 with the identification @xmath80 .",
    "( this means that we must associate classical @xmath80 to the spin quantum number @xmath71 . )",
    "thus the angles @xmath67 and @xmath1 appearing in the angular momentum coherent state eq .",
    "( 12 ) can be interpreted as classical phase space variables for a precessing spin with @xmath1 as the angle variable and @xmath81 as the corresponding action variable .",
    "in place of the conserved variables @xmath82 we will use other variables suggested by the o(4 ) symmetry .",
    "we will use the two o(3 ) subgroups in o(4 ) generated by @xmath83 .",
    "we define @xmath84    in place of quantum states @xmath85 we are now using @xmath86 of @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "( the @xmath71 quantum number is the same because @xmath89 ) .",
    "@xmath71 takes half integer values @xmath90 we get the states @xmath91 by going to the coupled basis @xmath92    the new angles are related to the earlier angles as follows ( ref fig.2 ) .",
    "the @xmath87 rotation rotates the classical vector @xmath93 from the z axis to @xmath94 without affecting @xmath88 .",
    "similarly the @xmath95 rotation rotates the classical vector @xmath96 from z axis to @xmath97 therefore the projection of * j * on the z axis gives @xmath98 where @xmath99 the line of nodes is along @xmath100 and therefore has the direction cosines @xmath101 . therefore @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath104 is obtained by taking the component of * k * along the line of nodes and therefore @xmath105 and @xmath106 the orbit is simply obtained from the vectors * j*+*k * and * j*-*k * because it is perpendicular to * j * and has the major axis along the direction @xmath44 with magnitude @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the bohr radius .",
    "also the eccentricity is given by @xmath109    the classical phase space measure in the new variables is @xmath110 for large @xmath70 , the state @xmath111 gets dominant contribution from @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "this is exactly as wanted by bohr quantization of the action angle pairs because @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "therefore we only have to fix @xmath116 by requiring the correct semi - classical limit and resolution of identity .",
    "we want @xmath116 to peak at @xmath117 as bohr quantization gives @xmath118 .",
    "also to get a resolution of identity we require @xmath119 for all @xmath71 . for normalization",
    "we require @xmath120 where @xmath121 .",
    "all these requirements are met by @xmath122 thus we get the coherent state as in equation no.(1 ) .",
    "in case of the harmonic oscillator coherent states @xmath123 the expectation values of the position and momentum operators are directly given by the real and imaginary parts of the label @xmath124 .",
    "also they are minimal uncertainty states . for our coherent states ,",
    "these properties are not valid exactly , but are valid asymptotically in the semi - classical region @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the semi - classical limit of our coherent states where the correspondence principle may be applied .",
    "consider the expectation value of an operator @xmath125 in a coherent state . for large values of @xmath126 and @xmath13 ( in units of @xmath127 ) , the coherent state is dominated by the states @xmath128 with @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "now , the correspondence principle relates the expectation value of @xmath132 to the value of the corresponding classical variable @xmath133 for the corresponding classical orbit .",
    "thus asymptotically , our coherent states are wave packets peaked around position , momenta etc . corresponding to the action angle variables labelling it .",
    "also , asymptotically they would be minimum uncertainty states",
    ". more detailed consideration of these properties for small values of the action variables will be considered elsewhere .",
    "we have constructed wave packets for the hydrogen atom , labelled by points of the classical phase space which follow classical orbits very closely .",
    "they have the correct semiclassical limit corresponding to bohr quantization .",
    "in addition , they have the desirable property that the resolution of identity involves exactly the classical phase space measure . as a consequence of incommensurate energy levels",
    ", our wave packets do not return to the original state after one period , but the overall features do not change .",
    "one may interpret this as follows : the wave packet has ( an infinite number of ) internal degrees of freedom , which may not return to the original state after a period .",
