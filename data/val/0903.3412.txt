    "it has been known for over a decade @xcite that at least 70% of the energy density in the universe is in the form of an exotic , negative - pressure component , called dark energy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the equation of state of this dark component , defined as the ratio of its pressure to its density : w = p_de/_de , is observationally constrained to be close to @xmath10 . in particular , constraints on constant @xmath4 lead typically to @xmath11 with @xmath12 accuracy @xcite .",
    "however , a variety of cosmological paradigms , based on scalar fields , attribute a dynamical nature to dark energy , leading to a time - varying @xmath4 .",
    "the class of models in which the scalar field is canonical is dubbed quintessence @xcite and has been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "an alternative approach is phantom dark energy , a component for which @xmath13 , which can be realized by using a scalar field with a negative kinetic term in its lagrangian , as first proposed by caldwell @xcite .",
    "such models have well - known problems @xcite , but nevertheless have also been widely studied as potential dark energy candidates @xcite . finally , since both quintessence and phantom models can not lead to a dark energy equation - of - state parameter that crosses @xmath10 during cosmological evolution ( which might be the possibility according to observations )",
    ", the simultaneous consideration of both models in a joint scenario , named quintom , has recently gained significant attention @xcite .    given the considerable freedom that exists in choosing the potential function @xmath1 of the scalar field , it is useful to develop general expressions for the evolution of @xmath4 which cover a wide range of models .",
    "a general result of this type was derived in @xcite for a class of quintessence models in which @xmath4 is assumed to be always close to @xmath10 and the potential is nearly flat .",
    "the flatness of the potential is characterized by two `` slow roll conditions '' : @xmath14 and @xmath15 for these models , it was shown in @xcite that the evolution of @xmath4 is described by a unique expression involving only the present values of @xmath16 and @xmath4 . in @xcite this result was extended to phantom models satisfying ( [ slow1])-([slow2 ] ) , and the corresponding @xmath4 dependence was shown to be described by the same expression with an overall sign change .",
    "finally , the extension to quintom scenario under ( [ slow1])-([slow2 ] ) was performed in @xcite , where a universal expression for @xmath4 was also extracted , allowing for crossing of @xmath11 .",
    "while the slow - roll conditions ( [ slow1 ] ) and ( [ slow2 ] ) are sufficient to give @xmath17 today , they are not necessary . classes of models characterized by the validity of ( [ slow1 ] ) alone , i.e. , without ( [ slow2 ] ) , were considered in @xcite , corresponding in particular to a quintessence field in the vicinity of a local maximum of its potential . in this case , there is an extra degree of freedom , namely the value of @xmath18 , which describes the curvature of the potential in the vicinity of the maximum . as a result , instead of",
    "a single solution for the evolution of @xmath4 one obtains a family of solutions that depend on the present - day values of @xmath19 and @xmath4 and the value of @xmath18 at the maximum of the potential .",
    "as expected , this family of solutions includes the slow - roll solution of @xcite as a special case in the limit where @xmath20 . in @xcite ,",
    "a similar result was derived for a phantom field evolving near a minimum of its potential .",
    "it was found that a unique family of solutions , very similar to the one derived in @xcite , can be used to approximate the behavior of @xmath4 in these models .",
    "more recently , chiba @xcite showed that while conditions ( [ slow1 ] ) and ( [ slow2 ] ) are sufficient to allow the quintessence version of the slow - roll conditions to be applied , they are not necessary .",
    "chiba extended the methodology of ref .",
    "@xcite to provide a more general set of conditions on the potential , dropping the assumption that the field is close to a local maximum in the potential , while still assuming that @xmath4 is close to @xmath10 throughout the evolution .",
    "interestingly , the expression derived under these more general conditions coincides exactly with the expression derived in @xcite , indicating the generality of this result .    in this work",
    "we extend the techniques developed in @xcite to the  opposite \" of the case considered there . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quintessence field was considered to roll near a local maximum in the potential , so that @xmath21 . in this paper",
    ", we consider the case for which @xmath22 .",
    "this corresponds to a canonical scalar field rolling close to a minimum of its potential . for completeness",
    ", we also examine the corresponding phantom model , for which the phantom field rolls near a maximum of its potential .",
    "that is , while in @xcite and @xcite the field rolls away from an unstable potential - extremum , in the present work the field rolls towards a stable extremum .",
    "( recall that phantom fields roll away from local minima and are attracted by local maxima ) . as we will see , this investigation yields a more complicated dynamics for the scalar field , which can include oscillations in addition to slow roll behavior . for simplicity , we assume that condition ( [ slow1 ] ) is satisfied , and that the field evolves near an extremum in the potential , rather than making the more general assumptions of ref . @xcite .",
    "the result can be generalized , in a straighforward way , following the development of ref .",
    "we note further than our main result is mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , although it is not investigated in detail there .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows : in section [ wexp ] we construct the model of scalar field evolution near a stable potential extremum , and we derive the expression for @xmath7 . in section [ comparison ]",
    "we apply our formula to various potentials , comparing the results to the exact evolution arising by numerical integration .",
    "we then constrain this general family of models with snia observations .",
    "our results are summarized in section [ concl ] .",
    "we are interested in models where the scalar field evolves near a stable potential - extremum , and thus we consider a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath0 in a potential @xmath23 , where the field @xmath0 can be either a canonical or a phantom one . in the following we introduce the usual @xmath24-parameter , acquiring the value @xmath25 for the canonical case , and @xmath10 for the phantom one . doing so we can present our expressions in a general way .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation of motion of the field reads : [ kg ] + 3h+=0 , where @xmath26 is the scale factor and @xmath27 is the expansion rate .",
    "dots denote derivatives with respect to time and primes denote derivatives with respect to the field @xmath0 . in a flat universe ,",
    "the expansion rate is linked to the total density @xmath28 via the first friedman equation ( in units where @xmath29 ) as h^2=_t/3 .",
    "additionally , the evolution of the scale factor is given by : = -@xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the total pressure .",
    "following @xcite we perform the transformation [ uphi ] ( t)=u(t)/a(t)^3/2 , and therefore eq .  ( [ kg ] ) becomes [ kgnew ] + p_tu+a^3/2v@xmath32=0 .",
    "we consider a universe consisting of pressureless matter and a scalar field , where the scalar field plays the role of the dark energy . in order to realistically mimic the observed dark energy ,",
    "the scalar field must have @xmath4 close to @xmath10 and its energy density must be roughly constant .",
    "the total pressure @xmath31 is then simply given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the present day density of the dark energy .",

    "( [ kgnew ] ) becomes : [ kgu ] -_0u+a^3/2v@xmath32=0 . since we are interested in applying eq .",
    "( [ kgu ] ) to a scalar field evolving near a local potential - extremum at @xmath36 , for any @xmath0 close @xmath36 we use the expansion : v@xmath0=v@xmath36+@xmath37v@xmath36@xmath38 ^ 2+o@xmath39 ^ 3 ) . substituting the above relation into eq .",
    "( [ kgu ] ) , and imposing @xmath40 we obtain the following differential equation for the field evolution : [ unew ] -@xmath41u=0 . this is essentially the same equation derived previously in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this work we examine cosmological evolution near a stable potential - extremum , that is either a canonical field ( @xmath42 ) near a local minimum ( @xmath43 ) , or a phantom field ( @xmath44 ) near a local maximum ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "thus , in both cases of interest @xmath46 and therefore the following analysis can be performed in a unified way .    defining [ k ]",
    "k , we obtain the general solution of eq .",

    "note that this solution holds for @xmath50 being either real or imaginary , where in the latter case the hyperbolic functions are straightforwardly replaced by trigonometric ones .",

    "@xcite , i.e. @xmath7 decreases monotonically , there are significant quantitative differences .",

    "the quantity @xmath58 can be physically interpreted as a measure of the sharpness of the curvature of the potential at its extremum . from the definition of @xmath58 ( eq .",
    "[ kdef ] ) we note that in order for @xmath58 to be real , @xmath80 is small , implying a `` flat '' potential .",
    "the field evolves in a slow , friction - dominated manner ( with the hubble parameter acting as the friction coefficient according to eq .",
    "[ kg ] ) , asymptotically coming to rest at the potential extremum ( minimum for quintessence and maximum for phantom ) . on the other hand , an imaginary @xmath58 requires a large @xmath80 , implying a sharp curvature of the potential at the extremum , which allows for oscillations since the friction term can be overcome .",
    "it is important to note that we fix the minimum value of the potential to be at the level of the cosmological constant , so the evolution is still potential energy dominated ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) as the field oscillates around the extremum .",
    "these oscillatory solutions are therefore very different from the ones usually considered in oscillating dark energy models @xcite , where the potential minimum is fixed at @xmath81 , and @xmath4 oscillates between @xmath82 .",
