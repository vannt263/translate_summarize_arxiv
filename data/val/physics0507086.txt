    "the rheological properties of a suspension will depend , when the particles are non - spherical , on the orientation taken by the particles in response to the external flow .",
    "for a few particle shapes ( e.g. the case of the ellipsoid @xcite ) , equations for the rotation dynamics exist in closed form , and it is possible to determine the orientation distribution of the particles in suspension . however ,",
    "unless a mechanism for the achievement of a statistical equilibrium is introduced , the orientation distribution will depend on the state in which the suspension is prepared initially . in the case of microscopic particles ,",
    "one such mechanism is provided by brownian rotations @xcite .",
    "it is still unclear whether inertia and interaction with other particles may contribute to the equilibration mechanism .",
    "an equilibrium distribution could be achieved alternatively by the presence of chaos in the rotation dynamics ; unfortunately , the importance of chaos turns out to be small in most situations . in the case of a simple shear and axisymmetric particles ,",
    "the particle motion is periodic @xcite .",
    "this motion becomes aperiodic in the case of a time - dependent flow , but remains non - chaotic for axisymmetric particles @xcite .",
    "chaos arises in the motion of a triaxial ellipsoids in a simple shear @xcite , but , depending on the axis ratios , large domains of initial conditions remain associated with regular orbits and to the absence of a uniquely defined equilibrium distribution .",
    "furthermore , for weak brownian motion , the regular regions will act as attractors for the chaotic orbits and will provide the bulk of the orientation distribution .",
    "the equilibrium orientation distribution of a brownian particle has been determined in various important limit regimes , depending on the value of the peclet number @xmath0 , defined as the ratio of the velocity gradient and the angular diffusivity ( which has the dimension of a frequency ) .",
    "the case of strong brownian rotation was considered by burgers @xcite leading to an orientation distribution that in first approximation can be considered isotropic . a systematic perturbation theory in powers of @xmath0",
    "was introduced in @xcite , allowing the calculation of the effective viscosity of dilute suspensions , for values of @xmath0 up to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "more interesting is the case of weak brownian motion , in which the form of the equilibrium distribution is determined by the structure of the orbits in orientation space , which in turn depends on the imposed flow .",
    "a technique for the determination of the equilibrium distribution of weakly brownian particles , based on singular perturbation analysis of the diffusion equation in orientation space , was derived in @xcite for the case of axisysmmetric particles in a simple shear .    in the present paper ,",
    "an alternative approach will be presented , based on the perturbative determination of the orbits in orientation space .",
    "this approach will appear to be appropriate in the case the flow is time - dependent , and , more in general , when analytical expressions for the unperturbed orbits are not available . for the sake of definiteness , the dynamics of a small disk in the field of an oscillating strain flow will be analyzed , and its contribution to the medium effective viscosity determined .",
    "this kind of flow could be obtained by means of a four - roll mill , as described in @xcite ; more interestingly , as it will be illustrated in the next section , an oscillating pure strain is what is seen by a particle in the velocity field of a gravity wave .",
    "this turns out to have application to models of wave propagation in polar seas .",

    "( [ 6]-[7 ] ) ceases to be valid ( back to dimensional units , one would have for the particle displacement @xmath59 ) .",

    "the presence of a coherent orientation regime appears to be preserved for @xmath22 with a crossover frequency @xmath61 slowly decreasing as @xmath62 ( at @xmath63 , one has still @xmath64 ) .",
    "the decrease in the crossover frequency can be explained in terms of the destabilization of the fixed particle orientation in the rotating frame , by the oscillating strain component of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the alternative regime of random particle orientation , is associated with @xmath65 increasing monotonously with @xmath66 , with @xmath67 generally aperiodic . in this case , from continuity of @xmath41 , @xmath68 will be topologically equivalent to an irrational rotation , and the sequence @xmath68 originating from a single @xmath69 will fill densely the interval @xmath70 $ ] .",

    "if the orbit in @xmath52 is approximately closed at @xmath77 , also @xmath78 will come arbitrarily close to the initial condition @xmath79 . hence , to identify approximately closed orbits , it is sufficient to look for recurrence of the poincare map @xmath68 . to see why this property holds , the two of eq .",

    "noise produces qualitatively different effects in the coherent and in the random orientation regimes . in the coherent orientation regime ,",
    "the main effect is smearing the transition to the random orientation regime .",
    "it is easier to describe what happens at the transition for @xmath17 , where analytical expressions for @xmath93 and @xmath94 are available .",

    "the particle is stuck at the stable fixed point @xmath98 and the period is by definition infinite .",
    "it turns out , that adding a small noise eliminates divergence of @xmath95 for @xmath99 , as noise allows the particle to escape from the fixed point .",
    "the time of escape from the fixed point can be expressed in terms of the inverse of the probability for @xmath52 to reach the border of the basin of attraction for @xmath69 , which is @xmath51 ; in other words : @xmath100 . the probability @xmath101 could be roughly estimated , approximating the dynamics of @xmath52 by the one of the langevin equation obtained through linearization around @xmath69 , in the presence of noise , of the first of eq .",

    "this langevin equation leads to the pdf ( probability density function ) for @xmath52 @xcite : @xmath107 for small values of @xmath106 , @xmath108 and therefore : @xmath109 thus , the rotation period is exponentially long in the inverse noise amplitude and the effect of brownian rotations on the orientation distribution , which is governed by the stable fixed point of @xmath67 , will vanish in the zero noise limit .      in the random orientation regime ,",
    "the role of noise in determining an equilibrium orientation distribution is fundamental .",
    "if brownian rotations were strictly zero , the evolution of the pdf @xmath110 would be given by propagation along the unperturbed trajectories described by eq .",
