    "subsampling and block - based bootstrap methods have been widely used in inference problems for time series ; see politis et al .",
    "( 1999a ) and lahiri ( 2003 ) for book - length treatments of these important resampling methods . to accommodate the unknown time series dependence nonparametrically",
    ", these methods introduce a bandwidth parameter @xmath1 , such as the block size in the block - based bootstrap and the subsampling window width in subsampling .",
    "the bandwidth @xmath1 plays an important role in the finite sample performance of subsampling or block bootstrap based inference .",
    "intuitively , if the bandwidth ( or block size ) is too small , it may not capture the dependence in a time series sufficiently , whereas if it is too large , the number of blocks for subsampling / resampling is too small to lead to a good approximation of finite sample distribution .",
    "statistically speaking , the bandwidth @xmath1 is a smoothing parameter as it usually leads to a bias - variance tradeoff in variance estimation or size - power tradeoff in testing on the basis of subsampling and block bootstrap . in the traditional asymptotic theory",
    ", @xmath1 goes to infinity as sample size @xmath2 goes to infinity and the fraction @xmath3 goes to zero , which is a necessary condition for the general consistency of subsampling and block - based bootstrap methods without additional assumptions .",
    "therefore , the role of @xmath1 ( or @xmath0 ) does not show up in the conventional first order asymptotics , although in practice the choice of @xmath1 does affect the subsampling / block bootstrap distribution estimator and related operating characteristics . in this paper",
    ", we aim to offer a new perspective on the use of these smoothing parameter dependent resampling methods based on the so - called fixed-@xmath0 approach , which was first proposed by kiefer and vogelsang ( 2005 ) in the context of heteroscedasticity - autocorrelation robust ( har ) testing .",
    "it was found that the asymptotic distribution obtained under the fixed-@xmath0 framework ( i.e. @xmath4 $ ] is held fixed in the asymptotics ) provides a better approximation to the sampling distribution of the studentized test statistic than its counterpart obtained under the small-@xmath0 framework ( i.e. , @xmath5 as @xmath6 ) .",
    "see jansson ( 2004 ) and sun et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for rigorous theoretical justifications .",
    "the fixed-@xmath0 approach has the advantage of accounting for the effect of the bandwidth , as different bandwidth parameters correspond to different limiting ( null ) distributions .",

    "are possible but are not pursued here . under the fixed-@xmath0 asymptotics ,",
    "lahiri ( 2001 ) showed that the subsampling and the moving block bootstrap approximations are no longer consistent in the case of sample mean , which seems to suggest that a direct application of the fixed-@xmath0 approach is fruitless .",
    "a novel feature of our extension is that we study the limiting null distribution of the p - value , which is @xmath7 ( i.e. , uniform distribution on @xmath8 $ ] ) under the small-@xmath0 asymptotics , but is dependent upon @xmath0 and differs from @xmath7 under the fixed-@xmath0 asymptotics . for a scalar parameter",
    ", we calibrate the nominal coverage level on the basis of the pivotal limiting null distribution of the p - value under the fixed-@xmath0 framework , and modify the small-@xmath0 based confidence interval by inverting the corresponding test .",
    "thus the impact of the bandwidth parameter @xmath1 on the subsampling / block bootstrap distribution approximation is captured to the first order using a p - value based adjustment .",
    "simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate that the fixed-@xmath0 approach delivers confidence intervals of better coverage in most situations and that the fixed-@xmath0 based intervals are slightly wider than the small-@xmath0 counterparts , consistent with early findings associated with the fixed - b approach ; see e.g. kiefer and vogelsang ( 2005 ) .",
    "so far the use of the fixed-@xmath0 approach has been restricted to the inference of a finite dimensional parameter . since the subsampling and moving block bootstrap have also been used in the inference of infinite dimensional parameters , such as marginal distribution function and ( normalized )",
    "spectral distribution function of a stationary time series , we explore an extension of the fixed-@xmath0 idea to construct confidence bands for these infinite dimensional parameters .",
    "unlike the case of a scalar parameter , the limiting null distribution of the subsampling - based p - value is not pivotal under the fixed-@xmath0 asymptotics and it depends on the unknown dependence structure of the underlying process .",
    "to alleviate the problem , we apply the subsampling method to approximate the sampling distribution of the p - value so inference becomes feasible .",
    "this double subsampling approach is also used in constructing the confidence region for a vector parameter .",

    "one can perform further calibration by subsampling , which leads to iterative subsampling , similar to iterative bootstrap in beran ( 1987 , 1988 ) . in practice , however , the selection of the subsampling window size at each stage usually involves quite expensive computation , and the ( finite sample ) improvement in coverage errors is not guaranteed by doing subsampling iteratively .    as pointed out by a referee ,",

    "his treatment is quite general but is mainly focused on the iid setting . by contrast , we deal with time series with independent data as a special case and the limiting null distribution of the p - value ( under the fixed-@xmath0 asymptotics ) is not @xmath7 . in addition , our calibration can be applied to the inference of infinite dimensional parameters [ see section  [ sec : infinite ] ] , which is not covered by beran ( 1987 , 1988 ) . another related calibration method in the bootstrap literature",
    "was proposed by loh ( 1987 , 1991 ) , who calibrated confidence coefficients using a consistent estimate of actual coverage probability . for a given confidence interval ,",
    "its estimated coverage probability is used to alter the nominal level of the interval , and it is shown that the calibrated interval is asymptotically robust under iid assumptions and some regularity conditions . similar to beran s work , loh s discussion is limited to the iid setting and his calibration method seems only applicable to the inference of finite dimensional parameters . for a comprehensive account of bootstrap iteration and calibration , see hall ( 1992 ) .    for a finite dimensional parameter , another way of making the statistic more pivotal is to do studentization using a consistent estimate of asymptotic variance of the original statistic . for dependent data ,",
    "this typically involves the estimation of long run variance using the lag window type estimate .",

    "consistent estimation of @xmath172 involves kernel density estimation for @xmath227 and long run variance estimation for the transformed series @xmath228 , both of which involve the choice of a bandwidth parameter .",
    "by contrast , subsampling and the moving block bootstrap can be used to provide consistent variance estimate , which lead to a studentized statistic , or a p - value , which is more pivotal than the original unstudentized statistic .",
    "both methods are relatively easier to implement , although they also require the user to choose the subsampling window width or block size . the self - normalized approach of shao ( 2010a ) , which uses recursive subsample estimates in its studentization , would be another good candidate when a direct consistent long run variance estimation is difficult , although there is an efficiency loss under certain loss functions .",
