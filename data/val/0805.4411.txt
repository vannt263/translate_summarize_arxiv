    "in heavy - ion collisions , initial geometric quantities such as impact parameter and shape of the collision region can not be directly determined experimentally .",
    "however , it is possible to relate the number of observed particles and number of spectator neutrons to the centrality of the collision . using the percentile centrality of a collision",

    "the position of each nucleon in the nucleus is determined according to a probability density function . in a quantum mechanical picture ,",
    "the probability density function can be thought of as the single - particle probability density and the position as the result of a position measurement . in the determination of the nucleon positions in a given nucleus , it is possible to require a minimum inter - nucleon separation  ( @xmath3 ) between the centers of the nucleons .",
    "the probability distribution is typically taken to be uniform in azimuthal and polar angles .",

    "the nuclear charge density is usually parameterized by a fermi distribution with three parameters : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the nucleon density , @xmath6 is the nuclear radius , @xmath7 is the skin depth and @xmath8 corresponds to deviations from a spherical shape .",
