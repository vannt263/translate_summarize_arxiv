    "electromagnetic processes have always played an important part in understanding the structure of the nucleon . among these processes",
    ", the electroproduction of the @xmath3 deserves a special place .",
    "in fact , from the viewpoint of the simplest quark model , the process @xmath9 is expected to proceed through the spin flip of one of the quarks , which implies a non - vanishing magnetic dipole transition and vanishing quadrupole transition amplitudes .",
    "this contradicts the experimental observations of non - vanishing quadupole amplitudes , although small when compared to the magnetic dipole amplitude .    the fact that the first available data  @xcite for the ratios of electric and coulomb quadrupole amplitudes to the magnetic dipole amplitude , e2/m1 and c2/m1 respectively , did not establish a definite picture for these ratios , motivated in recent years a renewed interest in measurements of such electroproduction amplitudes , mainly due to favourable conditions offered by new experimental facilities like mami ( mainz ) , elsa - elan ( bonn ) , legs ( bnl ) , bates ( mit ) and the jefferson laboratory ( newport news ) .",
    "results coming from these recent experimental activities are expected to allow for a great improvement in the experimental knowledge of the ratios e2/m1 and c2/m1 , as @xcite let anticipate .",
    "the difference between the quark model predictions and experiment caused intensive discussions on the structure of the nucleon , the delta and the transition density .",
    "this process has been studied in the context of many models of baryon structure , which made an overall correct description of these ratios to become a constraint in model - making and refining . in the context of the quark model , to accomodate these noticeable amplitude ratios , charge deformations due to _ d_-state admixtures in non - relativistic and relativized models have been invoked for an explanation  @xcite .",
    "other explanations can nevertheless be found : it has recently been estimated in photoproduction  @xcite , that the proper consideration of two - body exchange currents alone can give raise to non - vanishing quadrupole amplitudes .",
    "other quark model formulations , like a quark model constructed in the infinite momentum frame  @xcite , a light - front constituent quark model  @xcite and a three - body force model  @xcite , have also been used in addressing the @xmath3 electroproduction amplitudes and/or form factors .",
    "calculations regarding the electroproduction of the @xmath3 were also carried out in the framework of models fully based on chiral symmetry such as the @xmath10- and chromodielectric models  @xcite , the skyrme model  @xcite , the cloudy bag model  @xcite and also in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , with a recent work  @xcite extending it .",
    "another class of models is based on effective lagrangian densities containing , to different extents , ingredients like born terms , vector mesons and nucleon resonances ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to study the ratios e2/m1 and c2/m1 and their momentum dependence for the electroprodution of the @xmath0 in the chiral quark - soliton model ( cqsm )  @xcite , rewiewed in  @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the interaction of quarks with goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry . in the form",
    "used here , it can be regarded both as a version of an effective model derived from the instanton liquid model  @xcite with constant constituent quark mass  @xcite and as a non - linear version of the semi - bosonized nambu - jona - lasinio model  @xcite .",
    "it allows for an unified description of mesons and baryons , both in flavours su(2 ) and su(3 ) , with a small number of free parameters  @xcite , i.e. three in su(2 ) and four in su(3 ) ) . a successful description of static properties of baryons , like mass splittings  @xcite , axial constants  @xcite , magnetic moments  @xcite and form factors  @xcite has been achieved .",
    "in this work we generalize the work of ref.@xcite from photoproduction to electroproduction and consider also the flavour su(3 )",
    ". the su(2 ) calculation is done in exactly the same way as described and applied to many observables in ref .",
    "this includes the evaluation of rotational @xmath2-corrections in order to improve axial and magnetic properties . for the calculation in su(3 ) we apply the symmetry conserving approximation recently developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sections @xmath11 and @xmath12 we give a short account of the model , in the vacuum and baryonic sectors respectively , together with references to the original literature .",
    "section @xmath13 contains the application of the model to the electroproduction of the @xmath3 , whose results for the amplitude ratios e2/m1 and c2/m1 are presented in section @xmath14 together with their discussion . in section @xmath15 we present a summary of the main points discussed and the conclusions .",
    "thc chiral quark soliton model ( cqsm ) has been developed in refs.@xcite and is described in detail in refs.@xcite with numerous successful applications to the baryons of the octet and decuplet , in particualr the nucleon and its form factors ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the approach is ( shortly ) reviewed in this section in order to make the present paper selfcontained .",
    "the cqsm is a field theoretical model based on the following quark - meson lagrangian @xmath16    in this expression , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the current mass matrix of the quarks neglecting isospin breaking and @xmath19 is the dynamical quark mass which results from the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking . the field @xmath20 is the constituent quark field and @xmath21 designates the chiral goldstone boson field    @xmath22    with @xmath23 given by without suffix will be used when both su(2 ) and su(3 ) flavours are meant . ] @xmath24 assuming the well established @xcite embedding of su(2 ) in su(3 ) , which is known to ensure the restriction of the right hypercharge in such a way that the octet and decuplet are the lowest possible representations .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) corresponds to a non - renormalizable field theory .",
    "therefore , the practical applications must be done within a certain regularization method , which becomes part of the model . as in most of the applications @xcite , in this work we use the proper - time regularization ( [ eq : reg ] ) , since we prefer to work with the euclidean version of the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) @xmath25 where , choosing to work with hermitean euclidean dirac matrices @xmath26 , the operator @xmath27 includes the euclidean time derivative @xmath28 and the dirac one - particle hamiltonian @xmath29 in su(3 ) , due to the embedding , a projection onto strange , @xmath30 , and non - strange , @xmath31 , subspaces gives : @xmath32 @xmath33 with @xmath34 the vacuum configuration .      neglecting isospin breaking , two of the three parameters of the model in su(2 ) are the current quark mass , @xmath35 , and",

    "the factor @xmath44 comes from the trace over color and is written explicitly .",
    "the term @xmath45 is the so called one - quark - loop contribution since @xmath46 is the quark propagator in the background of the meson fields .",
    "the one - quark - loop contribution @xmath47 is real in su(2 ) , hence a proper - time regularization of ( [ eq : seff ] ) , @xmath48 , can be obtained by first observing that @xmath49 and then by using ( [ eq : reg ] ) .",
    "this effective action has a translationally invariant stationary point at @xmath50 , @xmath51 , identified with the vacuum expectation values of the meson fields in the one - quark - loop approximation .",

    "evaluating the traces in a plane wave basis  @xcite and for the pseudo - scalar field , this property @xmath52 leads to the identification , with @xmath53 , @xmath54 which vanishes in the chiral limit . here , @xmath42 can be determined from the so called gap - equation that results from the vanishing of the first variation of the action .",

    "turning to the pion decay constant , it is defined by the value of the matrix element of the axial current between the vacuum and a pion state @xmath58 the axial current is defined as the first variation of the action @xmath59 under the rotation @xmath60 from the regularized action we deduce the following form for the axial current : @xmath61 it is written in terms of the physical pion field , given from ( [ eq : pioninvprop ] ) by @xmath62 .",
    "the substitution of this expression for the axial current in ( [ eq : piondecay ] ) and assuming a canonical quantization for the pion field yields for the pion decay constant @xmath63 equations ( [ eq : mpi],[eq : fpi ] ) are now used for a given dynamical mass @xmath19 to fix @xmath36 and @xmath35 , in the one - quark - loop approximation . for reasonable values of @xmath19 ,",

    "the relations above for the pion are maintained . in the same line of reasoning as for su(2 ) , the empirical value of the kaon mass can be used to fix @xmath65 : @xmath66 it is found , however , that the value for @xmath65 obtainable in this way is lower than the phenomenological value of @xmath67 mev .",
    "we prefer then to fix @xmath65 to its phenomenological value by introducing a second parameter @xmath68 into the function @xmath69 involved in the proper - time regularization ( [ eq : reg ] ) , in the form @xmath70 , \\label{eq : phisu3}\\ ] ] which is then used in the regularization of all quantities in the su(3 ) case .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that , with the effective action considered here , the goldstone theorem , the golberger - treiman and the gell - mann - oakes relations are verified .",
    "the remaining parameter , the value of the constituent quark mass @xmath19 , is the only parameter left to be fixed in the baryonic sector .",
    "in fact it is taken from the review @xcite with a value of @xmath71 .",
    "this value of @xmath19 has been adjusted to yield in average a good description to many nucleon observables as e.g. radii , form factors , various charges , etc .",
    "in order to allow for a better understanding of both the way in which matrix elements of quark operators ( [ ev ] ) are treated and how the baryons are described in this model , we start by showing how the soliton mean - field solution can be obtained through the nucleon correlation function .",
    "it will be seen that the saddle - point approximation for the correlation function , expressed as a path integral , agrees with the hartree picture of the nucleon as a bound state of @xmath44 weakly interacting quarks in the meson field @xmath72 .",
    "again , all details of the model are well understood and have been described in refs.@xcite with many applications in ref .",
    ".    however , such mean - field solitonic solutions do not have the appropriate quantum numbers to describe a baryon because the hedgehog mean - field soliton @xmath73 breaks the translational , rotational and isorotational symmetries of the action .",
    "these quantum numbers are obtained in a _ projection after variation _ way , implemented using the path integral  @xcite .      the nucleon correlation function @xmath74 where the baryonic current @xmath75 is constructed from @xmath44 quark fields @xmath76 ,",

    "in ( [ eq : corr ] ) the quarks can be integrated exactly due to the fact that the action is quadratic in the quark fields .",

    "such a perturbative expansion in @xmath207 was not performed in the present paper since it was found in many calculations in the cqsm that the linear corrections @xmath208 are in general small  @xcite , as e.g. in the case of magnetic moments  @xcite . only for very sensitive quantities directly related to the strange content of the nucleon",
    "has the inclusion of the term @xmath207 an effect larger than about 10 percent .    in this calculation , because we aim to study the electroproduction at low @xmath209 , no correction for relativistic recoil effects was taken into account explicitly .",
    "such terms are of higher order in @xmath2 and are expected to become important around and above @xmath210 gev@xmath211 . in our approach , the interval for the photon virtuality",
    "is determined by the fact that the momentum transfer is @xmath212 , hence parametrically limited by the nucleon mass .",
    "the ratios are related to the multipoles ( [ eq : mm1]-[eq : mc2 ] ) through @xmath213 and @xmath214 our results for them are presented in fig.[fig : e2m1 ] and in fig.[fig : c2m1 ] .",
    "a first comparison allowed by these figures with the available experimental data , allows us to conclude that the negative signs obtained for these two ratios are in agreement with the experimental data obtained in the last few years . the multipole amplitude m1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1 ] and compared with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "it underestimates the data and the situation does not improve by considering the su(3 ) case .",
    "this can be traced back to the model since it also underestimates other magnetic - type observables .",
    "actually this feature is common to almost all of the hedgehog - type chiral soliton models and apparently the present approach does not provide an exception for this observable  @xcite .",
    "= 10.5 cm    [ fig : e2m1 ]    = 10.5 cm    [ fig : c2m1 ]    = 10.5 cm    [ fig : m1 ]    for the ratio e2/m1 , we obtain values , at the photon point , of @xmath215  % and @xmath216  % , in su(2 ) and su(3 ) , respectively .",
    "a comparison with the most recent photoproduction data  @xcite in particular with the value @xmath217  % , noted by the particle data group , reveals that our results are smaller , but that the su(2 ) value still falls within this estimate .",
    "our prediction for finite momentum transfers yields values which , starting at @xmath218 , tend momotonically to zero and vanish basically for @xmath219 gev@xmath211 .",
    "the predictions are in this range qualitatively in agreement with the data in ref.@xcite . the change to positive e2/m1-values at @xmath220 gev@xmath211 found by gothe et al .",
    "@xcite is not reproduced in the present calculations .    for a direct comparison of our numbers with the above data we must take into account",
    "that in our formalism the delta is a stable state , which does not decay into nucleon and pion ( unless the formalism is developed further which is not done yet ) .",
    "hence the model allows to calculate the real parts of the transition amplitudes , but not the imaginary ones .",
    "furthermore the extraction of the resonance contribution from the experimental data is not so easely performed and is still a matter of debate .",
    "the difficulties are related , among others , to the background contributions originating from the born term",
    ". this question of separating the contributions to the amplitudes has been adressed by several authors  @xcite and in some cases the non - resonance contributions were found to be large .",
    "an unitary ambiguity is known to exist in the case of the e2/m1 ratio  @xcite , related mainly to the models necessary to extract the resonance contribution . a status report concerning the latest determinations of e2/m1",
    "can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "speed - plot techniques @xcite result in e2/m1-ratios of about -3.5% , which are larger than those quoted above .    concerning the comparison with other models , values for the ratio e2/m1 at the photon point , obtained in the context of electroproduction studies , range from @xmath221  % in a relativized quark model  @xcite to @xmath222  % ( @xmath223 e2/m1 ) in the context of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , passing through @xmath224  % in the chiral chromodielectric model and @xmath225  % in the linear sigma model  @xcite , @xmath226  % in the skyrme model  @xcite and @xmath227  % ( @xmath223 e2/m1 ) in the chiral bag model  @xcite .",
    "although the comparison between models may help to understand the physical reasons for the observed ratios , it is also necessary to take into account that different ingredients are involved in the different model calculations above .",
    "the models more suitable for a comparison with the cqsm are the constituent quark model and the skyrme model , between which the cqsm is supposed to interpolate in the limits of small and large soliton sizes , respectively .",
    "indeed , we find that our results in flavour su(2 ) at the photon point are between the value of @xmath221  %  @xcite for the constituent quark model and the values in the range @xmath228  % to @xmath229  %  @xcite obtained in the skyrme model .",
    "one has also to add however that the nonrelativistic quark model can accomodate higher values , up to @xmath230  % , for the ratio e2/m1  @xcite if the effects of basis truncation are taken with care .",
    "in which regards su(3 ) , our value @xmath216  % for e2/m1 at the photon point is smaller than the results for this ratio obtained in hyperon decays within the skyrme model  @xcite , which fall in the interval @xmath231 to @xmath232  % for different model approaches .",
    "it is interesting to note that in subsequent and more refined calculations in these models the results approach an intermediate common value , thus decreasing the difference in the predictions : @xmath226  %  @xcite in the skyrme model and @xmath222  %  @xcite for the constituent quark model ( in photoproduction ) .",
    "the numerical results obtained in  @xcite show also the importance of the pionic degrees of freedom , both when compared with previous results in the constituent quark model and with the cqsm and the skyrme models above , which already include such degrees of freedom from the very beginning , to different extents , though .",
    "the role of the meson degrees of freedom may explanain the lower value obtained in su(3 ) as compared to su(2 ) .",
    "it may be caused by the poor description of the kaon cloud since the embedding of su(2 ) in su(3 ) imposes a pion tail for the soliton giving the kaon too large an importance .    for the ratio c2/m1 ,",
    "a comparison made in the same spirit as above for e2/m1 , reveals that this ratio slightly underestimates the data above @xmath233 gev@xmath211 , where other models  @xcite obtain a better agreement",
    ". nevertheless , our results are closer to experiment than the quark model results  @xcite . as for values of @xmath209 between @xmath144 and @xmath234 gev@xmath211 ,",
    "experimentally the situation is not clear . while some old  @xcite and more recent  @xcite data seem to show a peaking structure around @xmath235  gev@xmath211 , more recent results  @xcite still show a clear decrease of c2/m1 however less pronounced with values similar to those observed for @xmath236 gev@xmath211 . as far as we known",
    ", no model predicts such a peaking structure .",
    "instead , our results show a smooth growth of the magnitude of the ratio c2/m1 with @xmath209 .",
    "this behaviour is found within most of the other models in the range of @xmath209 smaller than @xmath210  gev@xmath211 studied .",
    "our results are closer to experimental results , together with  @xcite , when compared with the remaining models .",
    "the photo- and electroproduction of the @xmath3 have been investigated in the chiral quark - soliton model through the computed transition ratios , e2/m1 and c2/m1 .",
    "the three ( four ) parameters of the model in su(2 ) ( su(3 ) ) were adjusted to the pion decay constant , the pion mass ( kaon mass ) and from a general fit to nucleon properties .",
    "no parametrization adjustment to nucleon - delta transitions was considered . both ratios e2/m1 as well of c2/m1 are found to be negative for all momentum transfers , as indicated by experiment .",
    "the value of e2/m1 at @xmath237 underestimates the most recent experimental points by if one compares the numbers directly .",
    "this is the accuracy of the calculations also for finite momentum transfers .",
    "strong fluctuations of c2/m1 at small momentum transfers , as found in some experiments , are not seen in the present approach .",
