    "in a seminal paper published in 1982  @xcite , r. p. feynman discussed in great detail the problems connected with the numerical simulation of quantum systems . he envisaged a possible solution , the so - called _ universal quantum simulator _ , a quantum - mechanical version of the usual simulators and computers currently exploited in many applications of the `` classical '' world .",
    "if realized , such a device would be able to tackle many - body problems with local interactions by using the quantum properties of nature itself  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , even without the advent of a fully universal quantum computer , the construction of small dedicated devices , also known as _ purpose - based quantum simulators _ , would already be of significant importance for our understanding of quantum physics .",
    "the basic idea is to engineer the hamiltonian of the quantum model of interest in a highly - controllable quantum system , and to retrieve all the desired information with a measurement of its properties .",
    "many research fields would eventually benefit from such devices , such as two- and three - dimensional many - body physics , non - equilibrium dynamics , or lattice gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "recently , the scientific community is considering ultra - cold atoms as one of the most promising candidates for the realization of a wide variety of dedicated quantum simulations  @xcite .",
    "indeed , these gases are genuine quantum systems where the available experimental techniques offer an impressive degree of control together with high - fidelity measurements , thus combining two fundamental requirements for a quantum simulator . among the most recent experimental achievements",
    ", we would like to mention the observation of anderson localization in disordered bose - einstein condensates ( bec )  @xcite , the research on itinerant ferromagnetism with cold fermions  @xcite , or the reconstruction of the equation of state of fermionic matter in extreme conditions , such as in neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "an important drawback in the applicability of cold atoms as quantum simulators is the difficulty of coupling their spatial degrees of freedom to external magnetic fields .",
    "this prevents a direct simulation of the quantum hall physics  @xcite , the controlled observation of whose extraordinary phenomenology would shed new light on quantum many - body theory .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is to dress the system with ingenious laser schemes , which mimic the effect of an external magnetic field , and thus allow the neutral atoms to behave as effectively charged particles  @xcite .",
    "this approach led recently to the realization of neutral becs coupled to external effective magnetic and electric fields  @xcite , or even with an effective spin - orbit coupling  @xcite .",
    "more generally , the scientific community has now realized that even in presence of an optical lattice , dressing cold gases with suitable optical and microwave transitions could push the experiments beyond the standard superfluid - mott insulator transition , and significantly widen the spectrum of the models that are currently being simulated  @xcite .",
    "the possible applications of such optical - lattice - based quantum simulations are numerous and diverse , ranging from the realization of abelian and non - abelian static gauge fields  @xcite to that of quantum hall states  @xcite ; from the study of the anomalous quantum hall effect  @xcite to the quantum spin hall effect  @xcite ; from three - dimensional topological insulators  @xcite , to flat - band physics with a non - trivial topological order  @xcite , or non - abelian anyons  @xcite .",
    "recently , a big effort has also been put in designing schemes where the exotic effects associated to relativistic quasiparticles , such as the klein tunneling and the _ zitterbewegung _ , arise in a controlled table - top experiment  @xcite .    in this article , we elaborate on the idea of using a spin - independent bi - chromatic optical lattice dressed with suitable raman transitions to simulate interesting non - interacting field theories of lattice fermions .",
    "we present a concrete proposal to create a three - dimensional optical lattice that traps a multi - species atomic gas , and to tailor arbitrary spin - dependent hopping operators .",
    "we have already shown how this setup could break the su(2 ) invariance of the hopping rates for spin-1 atoms in spin - independent lattices , and how the simulation of systems subjected to three - body repulsion could benefit from it  @xcite .",
    "here , we extend this idea further , and show that the same setup allows for the realization of hopping operators which modify the atomic hyperfine state . combining this trapping scheme with fermi gases ,",
    "we show that this platform would open a new route towards the simulation of high - energy physics and topological insulators .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : setup ] , we describe qualitatively the idea of using an optical superlattice to realize a general hopping operator for a multi - species cold gas of alkalis . further analysis and technical details are given in section  [ sec : nontrivial ] , where we also present some numerical results that support the possibility of controlling a spin - flipping tunneling in this platform .",
    "the reader not interested in these technical details may skip this content without prejudicing the comprehension of the following sections .",
    "some final remarks on the proposal are presented in section  [ sec : critical ] . in section",
    "[ sec : proposals ] , we discuss the possible applications of the described scheme , focusing on relativistic theories and topological insulators , and trying to give a list of the most interesting phenomena which could be explored",

    "the low - energy structure of this potential is a cubic array of main minima separated by `` secondary '' minima located in the middle of each lattice link ( see figure  [ fig : superlattice2d ] ) .",
    "we note that additional higher - order minima are also present , but will not play any role in the phenomena discussed in this article . due to the specific form of the potential in equation  ( [ eq : potential ] )",
    ", the hamiltonian can be divided into three independent terms , each one depending on one of the three couples of conjugate operators , @xmath7 .",
    "consequently , the bloch functions of the @xmath8-th band with energy @xmath9 , can be written as @xmath10 . in order to discuss the effects occurring on the scale of one lattice site",
    ", wannier functions can be introduced for each band @xmath11 like bloch functions , wannier functions belonging to different bands form an orthonormal basis , and one can thus expand the hamiltonian in such a basis .",

    "the operators @xmath30 describe the tunneling from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , and are a common feature in lattice gauge theories .",
    "we have also included an on - site raman term @xmath33 , of strength @xmath34 , that induces a certain transition between the hyperfine states .",
    "note that we use gaussian units and @xmath35 .",
    "the claimed possibility of engineering a wide range of hopping operators @xmath30 , together with the state - of the - art control of the atomic interaction , makes already our system a versatile quantum simulator of lattice field theories . in this manuscript",
    ", we focus on non - interacting theories , which can be realized either with dilute systems , or by employing feshbach resonances to lower the interaction strength ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we stress that interesting phenomena can also be observed in non - interacting gases when additional ingredients are introduced in their dynamics , such as disorder or the assisted - hopping processes discussed in this article .",
    "let us note that the control of the homogeneous tunneling for a single - species atomic gas is straightforward , and would not even require the superlattice ( @xmath36 )  @xcite .",
    "moving to a many - species case , one runs into the problem that a general hopping operator also entails terms flipping the atomic hyperfine spin ( simply referred as _",
    "spin _ in the following ) , which are not easily engineered . here",
    ", we propose to realize such couplings by combining raman transfers and a bi - chromatic superlattice ( @xmath37 in equation  ( [ eq : potential ] ) ) .",
    "the proposal can be applied to all the alkalis notwithstanding their bosonic or fermionic nature . in the following , however",

    "if the coupling is detuned enough , the @xmath38 level can be adiabatically eliminated : no population is left there and an effective coupling is engineered between neighboring sites . left : scheme for a spin - preserving ( i.e. diagonal ) hopping .",

    "these hyperfine levels are all trapped into the same spin - independent optical potential  ( [ eq : potential ] ) .",
    "depending on the lattice theory we want to simulate , we select a subset of these hyperfine levels described theoretically by creation - annihilation operators in the lattice sites .",
    "we then identify such fields with the components of the lattice field theory to be simulated .",
    "this leads us to divide the hyperfine levels into two subsets : the subset of `` physically meaningful '' states , which belong to the hyperfine manifold @xmath47 , and the usually larger subset of auxiliary levels that shall be used to assist the tunneling and create the desired hopping operator .",

    "the couplings between the atoms in the main sites , @xmath73 , and the `` bus '' states , @xmath74 , are realized via optical two - photon raman processes transferring a net momentum @xmath75 .",
    "they have a mathematical expression proportional to the overlap integral of the initial and final wannier functions :  @xmath76 .",
    "this integral is not zero because of the term @xmath77 , which is of course relevant only if @xmath78 is of the order of the lattice spacing .",

    "interestingly enough , it is possible to eliminate adiabatically the intermediate level and obtain an effective four - photon coupling between neighboring sites ( see figure  [ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "we stress that different matrix elements can be engineered at the same time thanks to the magnetic - field splitting of the hyperfine levels  ( [ eq : hyperfinesplitting ] ) : the involved atomic transitions become non - degenerate and can be individually addressed with different lasers .",
    "furthermore , the use of coherent laser light for the raman transitions entails the additional advantage of being able to deal with complex phases , and thus to realize complex gauge structures at will .",
    "the realization of the non - diagonal matrix elements requires the lattice to be slightly staggered , a technique discussed also in reference  @xcite . summarizing",

    "furthermore , these terms can also be exploited to correct spurious on - site couplings which may be induced by the laser scheme .",
    "unfortunately , we note that there is no selection rule relying on the polarization properties of the light and the hyperfine moment of the atoms , which can be used to realize the different on - site and nearest - neighbors spin - flipping processes .",
    "the superimposed magnetic field can not be aligned at the same time with the propagation vector of all the three lasers , aligned along the three cartesian axes , which would be the case in which circularly polarized light could be exploited to induce controlled transitions .",
    "conversely , we shall rely on the different zeeman - shifted energies to selectively address the different couplings between the internal states .",
    "in this technical section , we theoretically and numerically confirm the qualitative scheme presented above .",
    "we study two simple but important cases : the realization of diagonal and non - diagonal hopping operators for a two - species atomic gas .",
    "these can be considered as the main building blocks needed to realize any tunneling operator even in situations with more than two atomic species .",
    "the most fundamental ingredient of this proposal is the possibility of using raman processes to induce controlled atomic transitions between different hyperfine states of the electronic ground state @xmath79 ( @xmath80 is the total electronic angular momentum ) .",
    "these transitions are realized with two lasers via adiabatic elimination of the electronically excited manifold @xmath81 . in the following ,",
    "we address the atomic levels as @xmath82 , with @xmath83 labeling the hyperfine degrees of freedom ( see also figure  [ fig : atomiclevelsk40 ] for some insights on the internal structure of @xmath39k ) , and @xmath84 the quantum numbers of the center - of - mass wavefunction ( in our case , the wannier functions of the optical potential ) .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , the induced raman coupling between the state @xmath85 and @xmath86 can be written as follows : @xmath87 this expression clearly factorizes the following contributions :    * the time - dependence of the effective coupling and its effective frequency , which is the difference between the frequencies of the two lasers @xmath88 ; * the dependence on the center - of - mass degrees of freedom , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the momenta of the two lasers ; * the dependence on the initial and final internal states and on the polarization properties of light , @xmath92 , which is a function of the dipole matrix elements between the initial ( final ) state and the excited levels .",

    "however , for completeness , we include the presence of a second raman coupling which would be needed to induce the hopping of @xmath186 and check that it is unimportant .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : timeevol_dh ] the numerical results .",
    "the realistic parameters used in this simulation are listed in table  [ table : diaghoprun ] .",

    "therefore , these results confirm the plausibility of our scheme to induce a laser - assisted tunneling between the atoms sitting in the main minima of the optical lattice . to make the simulation toolbox reacher",
    ", we now address the possibility to control a spin - dependent hopping process .      ,",

    "the inset shows the maximal populations of the twelve considered levels labelled @xmath190 and shows that only a fraction of the population is lost in auxiliary levels . ]    in order to study the realisation of the non - diagonal hopping operator , we consider an enlarged 12-levels model , which is a generalization of the previous one taking into account more hyperfine states .",
    "we want now to transfer population between the manifolds @xmath185 and @xmath191 and consider as auxiliary states @xmath192 and @xmath193 .    a big issue which must be solved to engineer such a hopping is the arousal of undesired spin - flipping terms induced by the laser .",
    "in this paper we consider the possibility of staggering the lattice with an additional optical field , in order to lift the degeneracy between the different sites of the optical lattice , in the same fashion of  @xcite .",
    "such a staggering can be done also in three dimensions since the cubic lattice is bipartite , and we consider staggering values of @xmath194 khz .",
    "figure  [ fig : timeevol_ndh ] sketches the experimental scheme we have in mind and shows the exact time evolution of the population transfer between the two levels of @xmath47 in two neighboring sites .",
    "interestingly enough , we show a flip of the zeeman spin during the tunneling process , and thus obtain the promised spin - dependent hopping operator . the parameters of the simulation can be found in table  [ table : nondiaghoprun ] .",
    "in the previous section , we discussed how the superlattice geometry could be used to create non - trivial hopping operators on each link . here",
    "we want to assemble these ingredients and discuss how to use them to engineer interesting quantum simulator in arbitrary dimensions , considering the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal .",
    "first of all , we stress that the lasers needed to engineer the hopping along one direction must transfer momentum along that same direction .",
    "therefore , just by controlling the beam propagation directions , we can tailor different tunneling operators along each axis .",
    "this is an important feature which will be largely exploited in the proposals listed in section  [ sec : proposals ] .",
    "this kind of _ directionality selection rule _ is also responsible for avoiding the population of higher - order minima which do not lie on the edges of the unit lattice cell .",
    "since they are not connected to the main minima by a line parallel to a cartesian axis , we do not consider any momentum transfer along such direction , and thus the formal orthogonality of the wannier functions localized in those minima is never lifted .",
    "due to the very general formulation of the superlattice potential , the setup is well - suited also to work in two and one dimensions .",
    "moreover in 1d it is possible to align the magnetic field splitting the hyperfine sublevels with the optical lattice . in this case",
    ", it is possible to use specific light polarization to selectively couple different atomic levels . as a short - term goal",
    ", it would be very interesting to understand what is the most interesting physics which could be simulated in a one - dimensional system , where the presence of more symmetries could lower the experimental intricacies .",
    "we partially address this question in section  [ sec : proposals ] , where we argue that several one - dimensional topological phases could be realized . in a three- ( two-)dimensional case , with the magnetic field aligned with the diagonal of the cube ( square ) ,",
    "the polarization of the light can not be exploited , only energy - based selection rules are reliable .",
    "unfortunately , energy - based selection rules are not enough to prevent , in the case of spin - flipping operators , spurious on - site spin - flipping couplings .",
    "we proposed to solve this issue by staggering the optical lattice , i.e. lifting the degeneracy of the lattice sites of some tens of khz ( see also the discussion in reference  @xcite ) .",
    "one should also mention that the diagonal hopping operators can still be engineered in presence of such staggering , with the only additional issue of using two raman couplings ( as in the non - diagonal case ) to match the energy difference between sites .",
    "each of the matrix elements of the hopping operators is realized via an effective four - photon process .",
    "this means that the spin of the atom can be flipped of at most @xmath195 : a careful analysis is needed in case one is interested in simulating a theory with more than 4 fields , because some hopping matrix elements might become avoided .",
    "finally , the description given in this proposal is essentially at the single - particle level where no many - body effects have been used . as a consequence ,",
    "the proposal works both for bosons and fermions , which is a valuable result .",
    "the proposals of section  [ sec : proposals ] assume the possibility of switching off atomic interactions with feshbach resonances . nonetheless , it would be of the utmost interest to study how interactions could fit into this picture , and to explore the rich variety of models that could emerge .",
    "we leave this problem for future work .",
    "we now conclude the part of the article devoted to the description of the experimental setup .",
    "we believe to have provided the relevant results supporting the initial claim that it was indeed possible to realize a system whose low - energy structure is described by hamiltonian  ( [ eq : claim ] ) .",

    "there are however distinguished exceptions to this paradigm , such as graphene  @xcite and topological insulators  @xcite , where quadratic fermionic hamiltonians contain a wealth of non - trivial phenomena . in the case of graphene ,",
    "a two - dimensional layer of graphite , the low - energy carriers can be described by emerging relativistic fermions without mass . on the other hand , topological insulators are exotic holographic phases with an insulating bulk , and a peculiar boundary that hosts robust conducting modes protected by topology arguments . in both cases ,",
    "the transport properties of the material differ significantly from the standard solid - state theory . in the subsections below ,",
    "we show how the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : claim ] ) serves as a versatile simulator of these two interesting phases of matter .",
    "the properties of a relativistic spin-@xmath202 fermion with mass @xmath203 are described by the famous dirac hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath204 where @xmath205 are the so - called dirac matrices fulfilling a clifford algebra , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 stands for the speed of light . here , @xmath209 is the @xmath210-component fermionic field operator , where @xmath211 for one and two spatial dimensions , and @xmath212 for three spatial dimensions .",
    "our objective now is to construct an effective hamiltonian starting from equation  ( [ eq : claim ] ) that closely resembles the relativistic field theory in equation  ( [ dirac_ham ] ) .",
    "the underlying setup consists of a gas of ultracold @xmath213k atoms , which is a non - relativistic system ; nonetheless we can design it as a quantum simulator of relativistic particles by exploiting the quantum statistics and a peculiar engineerable fermi surface .",
    "the idea is to engineer translationally invariant hopping operators , @xmath214 , according to the su(@xmath215 ) group , where @xmath215 has been defined above . for the particular choices specified in table  [ naive_table ]",
    ", one finds that the hamiltonian in equation  ( [ eq : claim ] ) in momentum space becomes @xmath216 where @xmath217 is a multicomponent fermi operator that contains the different @xmath215 hyperfine levels involved in the simulation , and @xmath218 is defined within the first brillouin zone bz .",
    "one readily observes that there are certain regimes , the so - called @xmath219-flux phases @xmath220 , where the energy spectrum develops @xmath221 degeneracy points @xmath222 where the energy bands touch @xmath223 . around these points @xmath224 , where @xmath225 is a binary variable , the low - energy excitations of the @xmath213k fermi gas are described by the effective hamiltonian @xmath226 where @xmath227 represents the momentum around the degeneracy points , @xmath228 are the dirac matrices listed in table  [ naive_table ] , and @xmath229 is the fermi velocity that plays the role of an effective speed of light .",
    "therefore , the fermi surface of the half - filled gas consists of a set of isolated points , the so - called dirac points , and the low - energy excitations around those points behave according to the hamiltonian of massless dirac fermions in equation  ( [ naive_df ] ) . as occurs with graphene  @xcite , or other cold - atom systems",

    ", the additional fermions around @xmath263 are spurious doublers that modify the physics at long wavelengths .",
    "a partial solution is to give the doublers a very large mass @xmath264 , so that they effectively decouple from the low - energy physics of the dirac fermion at @xmath265 , namely @xmath266 .",
    "we must find a way to engineer a momentum - dependent mass that differs from the global on - site raman mass discussed above . by combining the laser - assisted tunneling listed in table  [ naive_table ] , with the additional terms @xmath267  @xcite",
    ", the momentum - space hamiltonian @xmath268 in equation  ( [ mom_ham ] ) becomes @xmath269 , where @xmath270 where @xmath271 are the additional laser - assisted tunneling strengths .",

    "let us emphasize that our quantum simulator provides a complete control over the different masses , since @xmath203 depends on the on - site raman transition strengths , whereas @xmath275 depends on the assisted - hopping strength , and thus on the laser power .",
    "in particular , when these parameters fulfill @xmath276 ( i.e. @xmath277 for @xmath278 , @xmath279 for @xmath280 , and @xmath281 for @xmath258 ) , we obtain a single massless dirac fermion at @xmath265 , whereas the remaining doublers have been boosted to much higher energies .",
    "we thus achieve a quantum simulator of the so - called _ wilson fermions _ of any spatial dimension @xmath256  @xcite .",
    "we note that this decoupling between a single massless dirac fermion and its doublers is not in conflict with the nielsen - ninomiya theorem since the introduced mass terms explicitly break the aforementioned symmetries .",
    "this is particularly important in odd dimensions , where the theory does not preserve chiral symmetry , a fundamental concept in the standard model classifying right / left - handed particles @xmath282 . to preserve such symmetries , the concept of _ kaplan fermions _ arises  @xcite , namely massless dirac fermions bound to a lower - dimensional domain wall located at @xmath283 where the wilson mass gets inverted @xmath284 . since we have a complete experimental access to the parameters of the wilson mass , it is also possible to tune them such that @xmath285 , and thus the mass @xmath286 gets inverted , and one gets a lower - dimensional massless fermion bound to the region where this mass inversion takes place .",
    "let us close this subsection by underlying the versatility of our setup as a quantum simulator of a diverse set of relativistic lattice fermions .",
    "not only can we implement massless dirac fermions of any dimensionality , thus exploring their connection to weyl fermions , but we can also control their mass .",
    "this leads us to the concept of massive dirac fermions , and the notorious wilson and kaplan fermions dealing with the fermion doubling problem .",
    "interestingly enough , the physics behind these high - energy particles is intimately related to the materials known as topological insulators  @xcite , which are the subject of the following subsection .",
    "in fact , it is always possible to find a kaplan - fermion representative within each class of topological insulators  @xcite .",
    "topological insulators correspond to fermionic gapped phases of matter that are insulating in the bulk but allow a robust transport along the boundaries  @xcite .",
    "this robustness is due to the existence of gapless edge excitations which are protected against disorder by topological arguments ( i.e. they avoid anderson localization  @xcite , and thus transport charge even in the presence of strong disorder ) .",
    "the paradigmatic example of a topological insulator is the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe )  @xcite , a two - dimensional electron gas subjected to a strong magnetic field that displays a robust quantization of the transverse conductivity @xmath287 , where @xmath288 is related to the topological invariant known as the chern number  @xcite . in this case , chiral electrons bound to the one - dimensional edges of the sample avoid back - scattering processes , and are thus immune to disorder  @xcite .",

    "each class can be characterized by a set of discrete fundamental symmetries  @xcite , and a certain topological invariant , see table  [ ti_table ] .",
    "note that we have excluded the topological superfluids from this table , since their quantum simulation would require a pairing mechanism , and thus goes beyond the scope of this work  @xcite .",

    "therefore , a different experiment would be required for each class - oriented simulator .",
    "two representative , yet reasonably simple examples are the su - schrieffer - hegger model of polyacetilene  @xcite , which is related to the @xmath278 bdi topological insulator , or the @xmath305flux phase of the fermionic creutz ladder  @xcite , which is related to the @xmath278 aiii topological insulator .",
    "the former can be simulated by using a one - component fermi gas in a one - dimensional dimerized optical superlattice , thus obtaining @xmath306 where @xmath122 quantifies the different tunneling strength between superlattice sites  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the creutz ladder is described by @xmath307 where @xmath308 are tunneling strengths , and @xmath309 is a magnetic flux piercing the ladder .",

    "<S> we present a proposal for a versatile cold - atom - based quantum simulator of relativistic fermionic theories and topological insulators in arbitrary dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the setup consists of a spin - independent optical lattice that traps a collection of hyperfine states of the same alkaline atom , to which the different degrees of freedom of the field theory to be simulated are then mapped . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the combination of bi - chromatic optical lattices with raman transitions can allow the engineering of a spin - dependent tunneling of the atoms between neighboring lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> these assisted - hopping processes can be employed for the quantum simulation of various interesting models , ranging from non - interacting relativistic fermionic theories to topological insulators . </S>",
    "<S> we present a toolbox for the realization of different types of relativistic lattice fermions , which can then be exploited to synthesize the majority of phases in the periodic table of topological insulators . </S>"
