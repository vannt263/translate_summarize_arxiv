    "the study of topological phases has been actively pursued in condensed - matter systems for some years .",
    "this has resulted in the emergence of a new paradigm in the theory of quantum phase transitions : certain phase transitions can not be described in terms of local order parameters associated with spontaneously broken symmetries ; instead , the phases in such transitions are characterized by topological order.@xcite the most famous example of topological order in a quantum system is in the phenomenon of fractional quantum hall effect.@xcite other examples  experimental and theoretical  include quantum spin liquids,@xcite quantum dimer models,@xcite quantum loop models,@xcite etc .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that topological phases can be used to do quantum computation.@xcite the main obstacle in the realization of quantum memory ",
    "the basic ingredient of a quantum computer  is decoherence : it is difficult to prepare states that are robust to external noise .",
    "kitaev@xcite suggested that topologically ordered states can be used to overcome this problem .",
    "he illustrated these ideas in a spin-@xmath0 model on a hexagonal lattice which , quite remarkably , can be solved exactly .",
    "the ground state of the kitaev model has two phases : in one phase the elementary excitations have a gap in the spectrum and are abelian anyons ; the second phase is gapless in the absence of an external magnetic field , but develops a gap when the field is switched on , and then the excitations are non - abelian anyons . in topological quantum computation , braiding of non - abelian anyons",
    "is essential for the realization of universal quantum gates.@xcite regarding the feasibility of a physical realization of the kitaev model , there has been a proposal to realize it on an optical lattice.@xcite    apart from its potential application in quantum computation , the kitaev model is an interesting many - body system by itself .",
    "first , exact solutions are rare in dimensions higher than one , and second , the model provides a relatively simple platform ",
    "the hamiltonian involves only two - body interactions  to study concepts such as topological order and fractional excitations .",
    "thus , not surprisingly , the various many - body aspects of the model have been thoroughly investigated .",
    "@xcite there have also been some generalizations to other two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices.@xcite it is then worthwhile to find generalizations of the model in higher dimensions . in this paper , we introduce and study a three - dimensional ( 3d ) version of the kitaev model .",
    "three - dimensional models exhibiting topological order have been studied previously.@xcite    an exact solution of the kitaev model is possible due to the existence of a macroscopic number of locally conserved quantities : this facilitates the mapping of the model to a quadratic hamiltonian of majorana fermions hopping in the background of a static @xmath1 gauge field .",
    "the three - dimensional model we construct also has the above feature , which renders it exactly solvable .",
    "it has a gapped phase and a gapless one , just as in 2d , and although the phase boundaries are identical to the latter , the nature of certain excitations is quite different . in the three - dimensional model",
    ", the excitations of the gauge field are localized on `` loops '' .",
    "this gives rise to the possibility that , as yet unverified in our model , such excitations can obey nontrivial statistics , since double exchange in loops  unlike points  is topologically nontrivial in three dimensions ( for example , see ref . ) .",

    "it is a system of spin-@xmath0 degrees of freedom located at the vertices of a honeycomb lattice . in the honeycomb lattice",

    "( [ kitaevham ] ) are that for any spin , only one of the components couples to a particular neighboring spin , and the component with non - zero coupling strength is different for each of the three neighbors . as we will see later , this leads to the existence of a set of mutually commuting conserved plaquette operators , which in turn makes the problem exactly solvable .",
    "we note two features of the honeycomb lattice that are pertinent to the construction of the 3d lattice : ( 1 ) the coordination number of the lattice is 3 .",
    "( 2 ) the three types of links @xmath13 and @xmath6 are distributed in such a way that two links of the same type do not touch each other .      to facilitate visualization",
    ", we will first describe how to obtain the 3d lattice starting from the familiar cubic lattice .",
    "let @xmath14 be the @xmath13 and @xmath6 coordinates of the latter .",
    "the new lattice is obtained by removing those sites that satisfy one of the following conditions : ( 1 ) @xmath15 and @xmath16 , ( 2 ) @xmath17 and @xmath18 , ( 3 ) @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and ( 4 ) @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "that is , there is a criss - crossing structure between adjacent planes which ensures that the lattice is truly three dimensional  despite a coordination number of 3and not a set of mutually disconnected two - dimensional surfaces .",
    "the 3d lattice : the four sites inside the loop ( marked 1 - 4 ) constitute a unit cell ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the basis vectors .",
    "plaquette @xmath25 consists of sites marked 1 - 10 . ]    to parametrize the lattice sites , we first note that the unit cell contains four sites .",
    "the position vector of a unit cell is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are unit vectors along @xmath13 and @xmath6 directions , respectively .",
    "the four sites within a unit cell are at @xmath29 to define a kitaev - type hamiltonian , we need one more ingredient , viz , the labeling of links . to this end , we alternately assign @xmath4 and @xmath5 labels to the links in each of the rows and columns that lie on the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane ; the remaining links , the ones along the @xmath6 axis , are labeled @xmath6 .",
    "[ the ambiguity in the assignment of @xmath4 and @xmath5 labels within each row ( column ) is resolved by demanding periodicity . ]",
    "this way of labeling ensures that the three links emanating from each site have different labels .",
