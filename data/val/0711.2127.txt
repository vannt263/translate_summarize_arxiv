    "equivalent to a local , momentum - dependent effective magnetic - field , the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) in two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems introduces a spin - dependent , chiral motion of the electrons that is sensitive to the application of an electric field .",
    "this property , that opens up the possibility of manipulating the electron spins exclusively by electrical means , is at the root of the tremendous amount of interest in understanding the electron dynamics in the presence of soi , given the potential applications to spintronics .",
    "one such example is the intrinsic spin - hall effect , when a pure spin current flows in a transverse direction under the action of an electric field @xcite .",
    "the spin current is polarized along the third perpendicular direction .",
    "the magnitude of the spin - current response , described by the spin - hall conductivity @xmath0 , reaches , in a clean system , a universal value @xmath1 , independent of any sample parameters .",
    "the behavior of the intrinsic spin - hall effect @xcite in the presence of non - magnetic impurities has been a subject of intense investigation . while analytic calculations led to a cancelation of the effect even in the presence of infinitesimal impurity concentration @xcite , numerical studies , done in finite size samples @xcite , indicated that the spin - hall effect persists in mesoscopic samples , up to a certain disorder strength .",
    "it has been shown that within the bulk , the spin - hall conductivity is decaying exponentially along a distance of the order of magnitude of the spin precession length @xcite .",
    "more recent reports indicate that the discontinuous variation of @xmath0 in the infinite 2d system , from a finite value in the clean system to zero in the presence of the infinitesimal disorder , can be explained by introducing an additional dephasing effect associated with the inelastic electron lifetime @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that the spin - hall conductivity is enhanced by interactions that introduce additional scattering of the the electron spins and maintains a finite value even when the clean - disordered transition is performed .",
    "naturally , one wonders if the opposite effect might be true .",
    "are interactions leading to an ordering of the spins , such as the zeeman coupling to an external magnetic field , acting as decreasing factors on @xmath0 ?    inspired by these ideas ,",
    "we proceed to a calculation of the spin hall conductivity in a 2d system with rashba spin - orbit coupling , spin - polarized by a static magnetic field , perpendicular on the sample .",
    "the alignment of the electron spins along the direction of the magnetic field counteracts the spatial disordering induced by the spin - orbit coupling , leading in consequence to a diminished contribution to the spin current .",
    "further , we consider magnetic impurities and study the competing effects of the zeeman splitting and spin - dependent impurity scattering . the latter affects the magnitude of @xmath0 through the renormalization effects it induces on the vertex corrections of the current operator .    the simple model we discuss below , that of a non - interacting 2d spin - polarized electron gas with soi and magnetic impurities , allows the simultaneous investigation of the intrinsic anomalous hall effect , which would occur only when a finite magnetization is present , and of the spin - hall effect in the presence of a distribution of magnetic scatterers , previously analyzed within a paramagnetic system @xcite .",
    "our calculation is based on the kubo formula , where we take into account the scattering of the electrons on the magnetic impurities .",
    "the algorithm discussed here , generalizes to spin transport the traditional treatment of the off - diagonal anomalous hall conductivity of ref .",
    "@xcite , a method that has been also used with great success to investigate the anomalous hall effect in graphenes @xcite . within this framework",
    "we start by obtaining the impurity - averaged single - electron green s functions and the renormalized vertex correction of the velocity operator .",
    "then , we apply the kubo formula to estimate the spin - hall conductivity .",
    "first , in the case of a clean system , we use the exact eigenvalues - eigenstates of the hamiltonian and obtain an analytic result for @xmath0 which show its dependence on the zeeman splitting .",
    "later , we use the impurity averaged green s functions and the vertex - corrected current operator to estimate the spin - hall conductivity in the presence of magnetic impurities .",
    "analytical expressions for @xmath0 are derived as functions of the zeeman splitting and the magnetic impurity scattering .",
    "we consider a non - interacting two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas with rashba - type spin - orbit coupling ( proportional to the linear momentum ) in the presence of a magnetic field . the system is assumed to contain magnetic impurities .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath2 , is oriented along the @xmath3 direction and is perpendicular on the layer .",
    "the resulting zeeman splitting @xmath4 , proportional to the gyromagnetic factor @xmath5 is considered a parameter of the problem .",
    "the noninteracting , single - particle hamiltonian , written for an electron of wave - vector @xmath6 and kinetic energy @xmath7 in respect with the fermi surface @xmath8 , ( @xmath9 is approximated by the bare mass ) is @xmath10 where @xmath11 designates the spin - orbit coupling constant , while @xmath12 are the pauli matrices . in the two - dimensional spin space ,",
    "an elementary diagonalization procedure generates the two eigenvalues @xmath13 and the associated eigenstates of the hamiltonian : @xmath14 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 the effective rashba gap .",

    "this is not the case , however , when magnetic impurity scattering occurs , since now the static part of the dressed vertex is larger than the bare rashba coupling for any ratio @xmath61 . in our model",
