    "a fundamental theoretical challenge in strongly correlated systems lies in understanding the behavior of frustrated quantum magnets , whose properties often bear little resemblance to those of their classical counterparts . in the most exotic scenario ,",
    "quantum fluctuations are sufficiently strong to disorder the system even at zero temperature , and a spin liquid ground state emerges .",
    "historically , anderson originally suggested that the spin-1/2 heisenberg triangular antiferromagnet may realize such a quantum - disordered ground state.@xcite it is now recognized that with only nearest - neighbor exchange the true ground state on the triangular lattice is the magnetically ordered @xmath0 phase , though the order is significantly diminished relative to the classical state.@xcite it is conceivable , then , that a spin liquid may arise with not too drastic perturbations to the model , and the triangular lattice has thus remained a prominent setting in the search for two - dimensional spin liquids .",
    "recent experiments on the spin-1/2 anisotropic triangular antiferromagnet  stimulated renewed interest in possible spin - liquid phases proximate to the nearest - neighbor heisenberg model.@xcite this material is accurately modeled by an anisotropic heisenberg hamiltonian supplemented by a weak  interaction.@xcite although long - range spiral order develops at temperatures @xmath1k , the dynamical structure factor measured via neutron scattering exhibits `` critical '' power laws at intermediate energies , both in the ordered phase and in a range of temperatures above @xmath2 .",
    "this unusual power law behavior in the excitation spectrum is highly suggestive of spinon deconfinement that is characteristic of spin liquids .",
    "a variety of theoretical approaches have been employed to capture spin liquids on the triangular lattice .",
    "kalmeyer and laughlin exploited a mapping between the spin-1/2 heisenberg model and hard - core bosons in a magnetic field to obtain a `` chiral '' spin liquid which breaks time - reversal symmetry.@xcite their arguments were subsequently reformulated by yang _ et al_.,@xcite who arrived at the chiral spin liquid by fermionizing the spins using chern - simons flux attachment@xcite and expanding around a `` flux - smeared '' mean - field state . using a slave - boson representation of the spin operators , sachdev explored an sp(@xmath3 ) generalization of the heisenberg model , and in the large-@xmath3 limit obtained a z@xmath4 spin liquid ground state , which breaks no symmetries.@xcite the z@xmath4 spin liquid was later realized microscopically in a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice.@xcite finally , a large class of spin liquids was studied by zhou and wen using a slave fermion representation of the spins.@xcite whereas excitations in both the chiral and z@xmath4 spin liquids are gapped , the slave fermion mean - field approach can give rise to so called `` algebraic spin liquids '' , which admit _ gapless _ spin excitations and power - law spin correlations .    in this paper",
    "we pursue an alternate approach to the spin-1/2 triangular antiferromagnet , and use vortex duality to attack the problem coming from the easy - plane regime .",
    "duality has been a powerful tool for exploring unconventional phases such as valence bond solids and spin liquids in quantum spin systems,@xcite as well as complex charge - ordered states in bosonic systems .",
    "the main difficulty here is that vortices are at finite density , which is familiar from dual approaches to the fractional quantum hall problem . as an initial step towards applying duality to frustrated spin systems , in ref .",
    "we examined integer - spin triangular antiferromagnets with easy - plane symmetry from the vortex perspective . by _ fermionizing _",
    "the vortices using chern - simons flux attachment , it was shown that an effective low - energy dual formulation can be derived , which was argued to reproduce the physics of a more direct landau - ginzburg - wilson analysis of the spin model . while this approach is reminiscent of the spin fermionization adopted by yang _",
    "et al_.,@xcite we emphasize that alternatively fermionizing vortices is advantageous because the vortices interact logarithmically , which allows for a more controllable treatment of chern - simons gauge fluctuations .",
    "here we extend the fermionized vortex approach to the spin-1/2 triangular antiferromagnet with easy - plane symmetry and anisotropic nearest - neighbor exchanges @xmath5 and @xmath6 as shown in fig .",

    "this formalism allows us to explore the phase diagram of the spin model in a setting where a more conventional landau analysis of the spin model is _ not _ accessible due to berry phases .",
    "remarkably , over a broad range of anisotropy @xmath7 this approach leads naturally , with the simplest flux - smeared mean - field starting point , to a novel `` critical '' spin liquid that we will refer to as the algebraic vortex liquid .",
    "this state was introduced earlier and applied to  in a short letter , ref .  , and is characterized in detail here .",

    "[ bilinearqs ] and [ monopoleqs ] , respectively .",
    "such momenta for low - energy excitations in the spin system are determined by short - distance physics in the frustrated magnet , and we propose that this physics is well - captured in the vortex treatment .    going beyond a mean - field analysis , we argue that the algebraic vortex liquid is described by qed3 with an emergent global su(4 ) flavor symmetry , which has further implications for the dynamical spin correlations . in particular , as a consequence of the su(4 ) symmetry",
    "the in - plane spin structure factor exhibits enhanced universal power law correlations with the _ same exponent _ at several momenta in the brillouin zone : the spiral ordering wave vectors @xmath10 and momenta @xmath11 at the midpoints of the brillouin zone edges ( see fig .",
    "[ monopoleqs ] ) .",
    "the out - of - plane spin structure factor meanwhile has enhanced correlations only at the spiral ordering wave vectors @xmath12 .",
    "these nontrivial properties distinguish the algebraic vortex liquid from other known spin liquids .",
    "interestingly , the prominence of momenta @xmath13 in the theory appears to be consistent with recent series expansion studies of the heisenberg triangular antiferromagnet@xcite , which observe excitation energies at these wave vectors which are dramatically reduced relative to linear spin wave theory .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . the spin model and the dual vortex mapping",
    "are introduced in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .  iii the fermionized vortex theory is developed .",

    "we begin by considering an easy - plane , anisotropic spin-1/2 triangular antiferromagnet modeled by an xxz hamiltonian with nearest - neighbor exchange , @xmath16 +      \\sum_{\\langle{\\bf r r'}\\rangle}j^z_{\\bf r r ' } s^z_{\\bf r } s^z_{\\bf r ' } ,     \\label{h}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 are the usual spin raising and lowering operators . as illustrated in fig .",

    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath26 the @xmath27 term above energetically enforces the constraint of having either 0 or 1 boson per site as required for modeling a spin-1/2 system .",
    "the xxz hamiltonian @xmath28 respects a number of internal and discrete lattice symmetries which we now enumerate .",
    "the model exhibits u(1 ) spin symmetry and is invariant under time reversal @xmath29 and a `` particle - hole '' transformation @xmath30 which sends @xmath31 . under these operations ,",
    "the rotor fields transform as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant and @xmath29 is an antiunitary operation which sends @xmath34 .",
    "the model also preserves translations @xmath35 by triangular lattice vectors @xmath36 , as well as @xmath37-reflections @xmath38 and inversions ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath39 rotations ) @xmath40 about a triangular lattice site . rather than considering the @xmath37-reflections @xmath38 , it will be useful for subsequent developments to work with a modified antiunitary reflection @xmath41 .",
    "the latter operations transform the rotor fields as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an appropriately reflected coordinate . in the isotropic limit @xmath44 ,",
    "the xxz hamiltonian additionally preserves @xmath45 rotations @xmath46 about a triangular lattice site ; @xmath47 is then no longer an independent symmetry since @xmath48 .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in exploring the phase diagram accessible with the above xxz spin model as a starting point . in particular , as the low spin and geometric frustration strongly suppress the tendency to magnetically order , it is natural to ask whether spin - liquid phases can be realized with not too drastic perturbations to the model .",
    "to this end , we would like to derive an effective theory that governs the low - energy behavior of the spin system .",
    "this is , for instance , readily achieved for the integer - spin analogue of eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , and the phase diagram can be explored within a standard landau analysis . however , for the spin-1/2 system studied here a similar direct analysis of the spin model is hindered by the presence of berry phases .",
    "consequently , obtaining a low - energy theory is largely intractable in this formulation .    to proceed we utilize an alternative dual approach , introduced in the context of integer - spin systems in ref .   , wherein one considers a reformulation of the problem in terms of _",

    "although the vortices as defined are bosonic , it will prove extremely useful to fermionize them in a manner familiar from the fractional quantum hall effect via chern - simons flux attachment .",
    "doing so enables us to obtain a low - energy dual theory , which as we will demonstrate leads naturally to a novel `` critical '' spin - liquid phase , the algebraic vortex liquid .",
    "we proceed now to the dual vortex theory .",
