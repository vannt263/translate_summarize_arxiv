    "quantum electrodynamics in @xmath0 dimensions ( qed@xmath1 ) is a theory which shares a number of important features with quantum chromodynamics in @xmath2 dimensions ( qcd ) such as dynamical mass generation  @xcite and confinement  @xcite .",
    "since qed@xmath1 is super - renormalizable and has fewer degrees of freedom than qcd , it serves as a valuable laboratory in which to test new methods and ideas related to these phenomena . aside from its role as a testing ground for qcd , however , qed@xmath1 in itself plays an important role in solid state physics and in particular high-@xmath3 superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "recently several studies have pursued a new theoretical approach to cuprate superconductors  @xcite in which one describes the phase transition in the reverse direction , starting from the superconducting state . in this picture the antiferromagnetic phase , for example , corresponds to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of massless two - flavor qed@xmath1 .",
    "but there are also several other phases , and the large chiral manifold of degenerate states explains the complexity of the phase diagram .",
    "there are extensive studies using the dyson ",
    "schwinger equations  @xcite suggesting that chiral symmetry in qed@xmath1 is dynamically broken if the number of fermion flavors is smaller than some critical number @xmath4 . however , the scale of this symmetry breaking ( i.e. the magnitude of the chiral condensate ) is extremely small , and there are also studies  @xcite suggesting that chiral symmetry is broken for all number of fermion flavors .",
    "quenched lattice simulations have shown clear signs of chiral symmetry breaking , with a condensate @xmath5 in units of @xmath6 , the dimensionful coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "the situation for dynamical fermions however is not so clear , especially for an odd number of flavors .",
    "there have been euclidean lattice studies in both compact  @xcite and non - compact  @xcite formalisms with different numbers of flavors , all suggesting a very small condensate .",
    "the most recent euclidean lattice study of two - flavor non - compact qed@xmath7 suggests an upper bound for the condensate of @xmath8  @xcite , using large lattices .    on the other hand , hamiltonian lattice studies of qed@xmath7 with one fermion flavor",
    "have suggested a rather large value for the chiral condensate .",
    "these studies were based on the strong coupling expansion  @xcite and variational coupled cluster expansion  @xcite .",
    "the obtained condensate was @xmath9  @xcite , significantly larger than both quenched and two - flavor euclidean lattice results and about two orders of magnitude larger than the dyson ",
    "schwinger results for one flavor qed@xmath7 .",
    "in this paper we study chiral symmetry breaking in one - flavor massless qed@xmath1 . to our knowledge",
    "our analysis  @xcite represents the first non - perturbative simulation of lattice gauge theory in more than one spatial dimension with explicit fermions . by explicit fermions , we mean that fermions are not integrated out to yield determinants of the dirac operator",
    ". in the simulation presented here , fermion dynamics are sampled explicitly using fermion worldlines in a gauge - field dependent hamiltonian . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", this is an ideal framework in which to address the fermion structure of the ground state wavefunction . from a computational point of view",
    ", however , the approach presents profound difficulties such as the fermion sign problem and complex phase fluctuations due to the gauge field , both of which scale exponentially with the volume of the system .",
    "therefore it is not likely that this approach would be possible for qcd in the near future .",
    "however , we do find that by employing the recently developed _ zone method _",
    "@xcite , we can control sign and phase problems sufficiently to study chiral symmetry breaking in massless qed@xmath1 on relatively small spatial lattices .    in our study , we find that in the strong coupling region , @xmath10 , our results agree very well with the strong coupling expansion  @xcite .",
    "however , the agreement between the strong coupling expansion and our simulations breaks down around @xmath11 , and for @xmath12 we see a dramatic decrease in the size of the condensate .",
    "these results are in agreement with euclidean lattice simulations using staggered fermions  @xcite , suggesting a very small condensate in the continuum limit , @xmath13 .",
    "qed@xmath1 is a super - renormalizable theory , with a dimensionful coupling : @xmath14 has dimensions of mass .",
    "this dimensionful parameter plays a role similar to @xmath15 in qcd . in the chiral limit",
    ", it also sets the energy scale .",
    "we use 4-component spinors , such that the fermion mass term is even under parity . with one massless fermion flavor ,",
    "the hamiltonian exhibits a global @xmath16 chiral  symmetry .",
    "a fermion mass term breaks this symmetry to a @xmath17 symmetry .",
    "the question is : is this chiral symmetry broken dynamically ?",
    "the order parameter for this symmetry breaking is the chiral condensate .",
    "we start with the staggered fermion lattice hamiltonian on an @xmath18 spatial lattice  @xcite , @xmath19 with @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the plaquette operator given by the product of @xmath25 s circuiting the spatial plaquette anchored at @xmath26 , @xmath27 we use a dimensionless mass parameter @xmath28 and a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the lattice spacing .",

    "we have used @xmath88 , which appears to work well for both small and large @xmath78 .",

    "numerically , these minus signs give rise to the fermion sign problem . with the worldline formalism",
    "we can keep track of these permutations , and we use the recently developed zone method  @xcite to manage the sign problem and well as phase oscillations due to the gauge field .",
    "the zone method  @xcite consists of introducing a special @xmath93 spatial sub - lattice or zone .",
    "see for example fig .",
    "[ fig : zone ] .     spatial lattice with a @xmath94 zone .",

    "we obtain physical results by extrapolation to the limit when the zone covers the entire @xmath18 lattice .    as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , observables should scale linearly in the zone size provided that the zone size is larger than the characteristic fermion wandering length . for any finite values of the coupling @xmath78 and of the time variable @xmath56 , this wandering length is finite , even for massless fermions .",
    "thus one can extrapolate the results from relatively small zones to the entire lattice .",
    "there are different ways to define the size of a zone : by the number of lattice points or by the number of links inside the zone . for large lattices",
    "it does not matter which is used .",
