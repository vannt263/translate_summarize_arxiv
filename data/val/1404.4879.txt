    "the dichotomy separating active galactic nuclei ( agn ) into type 1  those observed to have broad emission lines  and type 2  those without broad lines  originated from the first observations of @xcite that demonstrated that the nebular lines in the nuclei of these nearby `` seyfert '' galaxies sometimes had broad emission wings superposed with a narrow core and sometimes did not . a working definition of type 1 and type 2 , based on the relative line widths of the forbidden and balmer lines",
    "was then elucidated by the work of . and @xcite",
    "later note that the observed emission spectra of seyfert galaxies are not so simple and argue for a continuum of intermediate types between these two extremes , e.g. , seyfert 1.2 , 1.5 , 1.8 , and 1.9 based on the relative strength of the narrow h@xmath3  component with respect to the broad component .",
    "@xcite presented a plausible scenario to physically explain this dichotomy by invoking different line of sight orientations : the broad line - emitting region ( blr ) in type 2 agn ( sy2s ) is obscured by an optically thick , geometrically flattened medium ( often referred to as the torus ) leading to a  hidden \" blr ( hblr ) , whereas the blr is visible in type 1 agn ( sy1s ) because our line of sight is not obscured by this optically thick medium .",
    "this unified model of agn ( see also * ? ? ? * ) followed from the discovery by @xcite that broad emission lines were present in the polarization spectrum of ngc1068 .",
    "the key assumption in this model is that all agn systems are physically similar , with generally disk - like geometries .",
    "thus , it is only the line of sight orientation of the blr with respect to the obscuring medium that results in the observed type differences .    the unified model for sy1 and",
    "sy2 systems has been challenged by observations that suggest that not _ all _ agn conform to this paradigm .",
    "sy2s that do not have broad lines observed even through spectropolarimetry have been coined non - hblr or",
    " true \" sy2s , and some may , in fact , be  bare \" sy2s that are postulated to be devoid of the typical obscuring medium surrounding the blr .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite advises caution before classifying objects as non - hblr objects , as finding reflected broad lines is largely serendipitous and dependent on the particular source having a well - placed scattering medium with the right properties .",
    "thus , the existence of true or bare sy2 s may not be well quantified .",
    "nonetheless , there are also objects known as  changing look \" agn , which are more easily identifiable because an obvious change has occurred in the observed spectrum to warrant the application of this classification .",
    "this characterization was originally coined based on x - ray observations in which sources appear alternately compton - thin or  reflection - dominated \" ( likely compton thick ) over the course of years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this qualifier has recently been extended to include objects which sometimes appear to have sy2 and sometimes sy1 characteristics in their optical spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "several examples of these optical changing look agns appear the literature over the years .",
    "one of the most well - cited early examples is that of ngc4151 , one of seyfert s original galaxies assigned type 1.5 by @xcite , but in which the optical broad lines all but disappeared ( except for weak and possibly asymmetric wings ) in the 1980 s @xcite and have since returned ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there are two typically accepted postulates to explain agn changing their type : ( 1 ) variable obscuration or ( 2 ) variable accretion rate .",
    "variations in the obscuring medium is more suited to the unification paradigm of type resulting from different viewing angles and is typically invoked to explain changing look agn in the x - ray regime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , it has been suggested that variations in luminosity and accretion rate are not only responsible for type changes in individual objects but are also responsible for the whole agn typing sequence . in other words ,",
    "the structure of the blr changes with accretion rate , and objects evolve from high accretion rate when the agn turns on  type 1  to low accretion rate once the agn has depleted its nuclear material  type 2 , possibly oscillating between type 1 and type 2 and/or intermediate types between high and low accretion states while the nucleus remains active . at sufficiently low accretion rates ,",
    "many postulates exist demonstrating that a radiatively efficient blr simply can not be supported , due to , e.g. , ( 1 ) a dearth of ionizing photon flux , ( 2 ) the critical radius at which the accretion disk changes from gas pressure - dominated to radiation pressure - dominated becoming smaller than the inner - most stable orbit @xcite , ( 3 ) mass conservation considerations in the paradigm that the blr arises in a disk wind with a fixed radial column , where the mass outflow rate can not be sustained , or ( 4 ) the accretion disk structure changing , replacing the disk - wind blr with a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) consisting of a fully ionized , low - density plasma incapable of producing broad lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite similarly suggests a bolometric luminosity below which the blr can not exist , though with a slightly different argument following from a maximally observed broad line width .",
    "observational results suggest that both of these physical processes are likely at play in different objects .",
    "for example , @xcite present a serendipitously detected _ nustar _ source at redshift @xmath4 for which observations suggest that significant obscuration may have moved into our line of sight to the nucleus of this source , changing it from a type 1 to type 2 : sed template fitting ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show its sed is currently consistent with other optically identified type 2 agn in the same sample and an @xmath50.5 mag , yet based on archival observations , its sed was previously consistent with that of a type 1 agn with estimated @xmath60.01 mag .",
    "@xcite also presents a recent optical spectrum of this source , j183443 + 3237.8 , that shows narrow emission lines and significant reddening of the continuum , though there is evidence for a weak broad component of mgii . on the other hand , @xcite report on the interesting behavior of ngc2617 , which has changed from a sy1.8 @xcite to a sy1 ,",
    "likely ( though not conclusively ) due to a recent outburst that triggered a transient source alert within the all - sky automated survey for supernovae ( asas - snassassin ] ) .",
    "subsequent observations of this agn demonstrated a continued increase of the optical through x - ray emission by about an order of magnitude compared to past observations @xcite . due to the outburst nature of this activity , which occurred over relatively short",
    "time scales , it is highly unlikely that obscuration moving out of the line of sight could be responsible for this change in type .",
    "additionally , the optical spectral changes between type 2 and type 1.9 of ngc2992 also seem to be at least loosely correlated with large variability amplitudes ( factors of a few tens ) observed in the x - rays over both short ( year ) and long ( decades ) time scales , such that broad h@xmath2  only seems to be observed coincident with high x - ray states ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we have collected both archival and new data covering the x - ray , uv , and optical wavelength regimes in an attempt to better understand the recent behavior of mrk590 .",
    "we present a selection of 10 optical spectra that span more than four decades of observations of mrk 590 .",
    "these have been gleaned from the personal archives of the authors , the literature , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and new observations .",
    "data are presented in chronological order of the known or presumed date of observation :    1 .",
    "historical lick observatory spectra of mrk590 from 1973 were measured from copies of the original reduced spectra provided by the late prof .",
    "donald osterbrock to one of the authors ( rwp ) .",
    "details of the observation and reduction of these spectra are given in @xcite , however , we note two important items about these spectra . first , no explicit date is available , either in the spectral image headers ( which were converted from raw ids output to fits format in 1996 ) , or in the @xcite paper .",
    "second , @xcite states that all of the spectra were taken  in the years 1974@xmath11976 \" , so it is possible that these spectra are from 1974 , though it is equally likely that 1973 is correct , and they were taken early during the commissioning of the ids in 1972/73 .",
    "the entrance aperture of this spectrograph was 27 @xmath12 4 .",
    "spectra of mrk590 were obtained at the 1.8-m perkins telescope at lowell observatory with the ohio state university image dissector scanner @xcite through a 7  round aperture in 1984@xmath11986 and have been previously discussed in the literature by @xcite . here , we present spectra from jd2445672 and jd2445674  1983 december  which cover the blue ( h@xmath3 ) and red ( h@xmath2 ) sides of the spectrum , respectively .",
    "we chose these spectra from the full set because of the near simultaneity of the red and blue wavelength coverage , fewer relative flux calibration issues , and/or the longer combined wavelength coverage than afforded by other spectra in this set .",
    "we merged these nearly contemporaneous spectra , multiplicatively scaling the red spectrum by a factor of 1.08 to match the blue spectrum .",
    "mrk590 was targeted in an early reverberation mapping campaign , during which 102 spectra were obtained of the h@xmath3  emission region between jd2447837 and jd2450388 ( 1989 nov  1996 oct ) and from which the black hole mass was determined to be @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "details of the campaign and observations are described by @xcite . for completeness",
    "we note that the spectra were taken through a 5  slit and extracted through a 76 aperture .",
    "we took spectra from three epochs during this campaign : jd2447837  1989 november  the beginning of the campaign , jd2448999  1993 january  chosen to be roughly 10 years after the previous 1983 spectrum , and jd2450365  1996 oct  which was near the end of the campaign .",
    "mrk590 was observed by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) on mjd2452649  2003 january  serendipitously continuing our roughly 10 year interval between archival optical spectra .",
    "the sdss spectra were obtained through a 3  diameter fiber and spectrophotometric calibration is based on simultaneously observed field stars .",
    "a spectrum of mrk590 was obtained on the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope at mdm observatory on jd2454000  2006 sep  using the ccd spectrograph with the 350  l / mm grating .",
    "the observation was obtained with a 1slit and extracted through a 12  aperture .",
    "unfortunately , all of the data obtained during this observing run suffer from the presence of an unexplained low - level and time - variable signal in the underlying bias levels that somewhat distorted the continuum shape of the mrk590 spectrum .",
    "due to the time - variable nature of the signal , we were unable to correct the spectra , but we truncated the most blueward and redward wavelength ranges that were the most affected . as a result , the flux calibration of the overall spectrum , and even that as a function of wavelength , is not highly reliable . nonetheless , we did not deem this issue problematic enough to justify omitting this spectrum , as it represents an important epoch in the changing nature of this object , as discussed below .",
    "we used the mods1 spectrograph on the large binocular telescope to obtain an optical spectrum of mrk 590 on 2013 february 14 .",
    "we used both the red and blue channel of mods1 with the dichroic to obtain wavelength coverage from 3200@xmath110000 .",
    "the blue - channel spectra used the g400l grating ( 400linesmm@xmath11 in first order ) , and the red - channel spectra used the g670l grating ( 250linesmm@xmath11 in first order ) .",
    "for all spectra we used the 12 segmented long - slit mask ( ls5x60x1.2 ) , oriented along the parallactic angle to minimize the effects of differential atmospheric refraction .",
    "the spectra were extracted with a 4  aperture .",
    "we next observed mrk590 on 2013 december 18 during commissioning of the new kitt peak ohio state multi - object spectrograph ( kosmos ) on the mayall 4-m telescope .",
    "observations were taken through an 09 longslit , using both the red and blue vph grisms to cover the wavelength range @xmath04000@xmath19000 .",
    "the spectra were extracted with an 116 aperture .",
    "most recently , on 2014 january 7 , another spectrum was taken on the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope at mdm observatory with the ccd spectrograph and the 350 l / mm grating .",
    "this time , the spectrum was taken through a 5  slit and extracted with a 15  aperture because it was observed at the start of a reverberation mapping program that requires these large apertures .",
    "figure [ fig_allspec ] shows all 10 of the optical spectra discussed above .",
    "these spectra were de - redshifted to the restframe of mrk590 and resampled onto separate linear wavelength scales similar to the natural dispersion of each respective spectrum near 5100 .",
    "the absolute spectrophotometry of several of these observations is not strictly reliable due to the uncertain conditions or known poor conditions under which they were taken .",
    "the spectra with the most reliable absolute flux calibration are ( 1 ) the 1989 , 1993 , and 1996 rm campaign spectra , which were calibrated to the assumed constant [ oiii]@xmath145007 line flux measured from data taken under photometric conditions ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we obtained this new _ hst _  observation of mrk590 on 2013 july 17 with the g140l mode of the fuv detector on the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) .",
    "the data were processed with the standard pipelines , and the final 1d spectrum was de - redshifted and binned to a linear dispersion of 0.4pixel@xmath11 .",
    "mrk590 was previously observed in the uv by the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ on 1982 july 20 and 1991 january 14 .",
    "we downloaded these spectra from the _ iue _ archives and converted them to the multispec fits format in iraf .",
    "we only analyzed the swp channel spectra , which cover a similar wavelength range as the new cos observations , although lwp observations from both dates also exist .",
    "we de - redshifted the iue spectra to rest frame wavelengths and resampled them onto a linear wavelength scale of 1.5pixel@xmath11 .",
    "these spectra are shown in the left panels of figure [ fig_uvspec ] .",
    "we also obtained _ chandra _ director s discretionary time contemporaneous with the new _ hst _",
    "observations , and thereby observed mrk590 with the hetgs on 2013 june 17 for @xmath030ks to investigate the consequences of the observed change in mrk590 on the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the hetgs consists of two grating assemblies , a high - energy grating ( heg ) and a medium - energy grating ( meg ) .",
    "the heg ( meg ) bandpass covers 0.8@xmath110kev ( 0.5@xmath110kev ) , but the effective area of both instruments falls off rapidly at either end of the bandpass .",
    "we reduced the data for both gratings using the standard chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software ( v4.3 ) and chandra calibration database ( caldb , v4.4.2 ) and followed the standard _",
    "data reduction threads . to increase s / n we co - added the negative and positive first - order spectra and built the effective area files ( arfs ) using the _ fullgarf _ ciao script .",
    "we then binned the meg spectrum ( at least 20 counts per bin ) .",
    "additionally , we analysed the zeroth order spectrum which has somewhat higher s / n ; there are 620 total counts ( 0.28 kev ) in the zeroth order , compared to 450 counts in the combined 1st order of meg .",
    "nonethess , we plot the meg spectrum in figure [ fig_xrayspec ] to show how these new data compare with previous _ chandra _ archival hetgs observations from 2004 @xcite that were reprocessed here in a similar manner .",
    "the active nucleus of mrk590 sits within a nearby , typical sa(s)a galaxy . as a result",
    "a significant portion of the light entering our spectroscopic apertures is host galaxy starlight rather than emission from the agn itself .",
    "this contamination must be subtracted to accurately assess the changing luminosity of the agn .",
    "@xcite used _ hst _ images to measure the host galaxy starlight contribution to the observed flux at rest frame 5100 , but the amount of host flux will depend on the spectroscopic aperture .",
    "bentz et al .",
    "report the flux within the spectroscopic aperture used for the @xcite rm campaign spectra of mrk590 to be @xmath16 erg s@xmath11 @xmath17 @xmath11 .",
    "the optical spectra discussed here were obtained through a variety of entrance apertures , so we estimate the starlight flux by fitting a starlight model to the 2013 mods1 spectrum , chosen for its combination of long wavelength coverage , high spectral resolution ( @xmath18 ) , and paucity of thermal agn continuum emission .",
    "we modeled the underlying stellar continuum using the starlight spectral synthesis code @xcite .",
    "we have fit @xcite models to the continuum between 3320  9500 , using a @xcite reddening law and masking nebular emission lines and the location of the meinel bands where sky subtraction is challenging ( @xmath07500 , * ? ? ?",
    "the intrinsic dispersion of the starlight model fit is 1pixel@xmath11 , so we resampled the model to the dispersion of each of our sample optical spectra and then matched the resampled model to each by applying a multiplicative scale factor to account for the different entrance apertures .",
    "the resulting scale factors roughly follow expectations based on the aperture differences between spectra , though a strict scaling vs.  aperture relation is not expected because of seeing effects and because the host galaxy starlight is not symmetric about the nucleus ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this method leads to an estimate of the starlight contribution near 5100  in the @xcite rm campaign spectra considered here from 1989 , 1993 , and 1996 , which were all taken through the same aperture , of @xmath19 erg s@xmath11 @xmath17 @xmath11 , which is consistent with the @xcite measurement .",
    "there is no evidence for any underlying agn thermal continuum emission in the 2013 mods1 spectrum .",
    "however , for epochs where an additional power - law component from the agn continuum was required to account for all of the observed emission , we first scaled the starlight model to match the strength of host galaxy stellar absorption features ( e.g. , mg ib and/or nad ) , and then included an additional power - law component of the form @xmath20 , where the flux and wavelength normalization , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , and the power - law slope , @xmath2 , were left as free parameters .",
    "these host starlight and power - law continuum components , where applicable , are shown by the red and blue curves , respectively , in figure [ fig_allspec ] .",
    "dramatic changes are clearly visible in figure [ fig_allspec ] in the optical nuclear emission from mrk590 over the last four decades . as mentioned above , the relative strength of the composite starlight component needed to fit each spectrum is a strong function of the spectroscopic aperture , but otherwise , as expected , the appearance and strength of the stellar features have not changed over the time spanned by our observations , and the model that was fit to the 2013 february spectrum is a good match to the features seen at all other epochs .",
    "the same can not be said of the agn continuum contribution , which can be estimated from the power law component .",
    "however , because of ( 1 ) the varying ( and often short ) wavelength range of the available data , ( 2 ) the degeneracy between the power - law and starlight components , and ( 3 ) the sometimes questionable accuracy of the flux calibration and response curve correction within this heterogeneous data set , the details of the power - law fit parameters are not individually reliable ( and are therefore not provided ) .",
    "this is particularly true of the weak power - law component to the most recent , 2014 january spectrum , where the necessity of this component is not statistically significant , even at the 1@xmath23 level , given the s / n and the short wavelength coverage of the spectrum .",
    "nonetheless , the relative increase ( and then decrease ) in strength and steepness of the power - law slope as the broad lines strengthen ( and then weaken ) from the 1970s to 1990s ( the 1990s to the 2000s ) is qualitatively significant .    the rise and fall of the optical agn continuum over the past four decades can be quantitatively evaluated from the 5100  agn continuum flux estimates for each of the spectra in our sample , provided in table  1 and shown in figure [ fig_lightcurves ] , based on the starlight - subtracted optical spectra .",
    "for the 2013 and 2014 spectra , the estimated continuum fluxes are strict upper limits because the weak residuals left after subtraction of the starlight fit are as likely to be noise and the consequence of an imperfect stellar model as they are minimal contributions from the agn .",
    "nonetheless , this still gives an indication of the change in flux over this time .",
    "based on this sample , the peak in both the broad emission line strength and the continuum flux is observed from the 1989 spectrum . however , work by @xcite and @xcite indicate that the peak continuum state may have been as early as 1988 , as they report the optical , non - stellar continuum flux at 5000  to be @xmath24 erg s@xmath11 @xmath17 @xmath11 from a spectrum taken on 1988 sept 8 , which is @xmath020% higher than that in our 1989 spectrum .",
    "these estimates suggest a weakening in the strength of the agn continuum component of 2@xmath13 orders of magnitude since the late 1980 s , but stronger constraints on the changes in the agn sed can be set with shorter wavelength observations , where the host galaxy no longer contributes significantly to the measured flux .",
    "the uv continuum flux measurements from the _ iue _ and cos spectra , also presented in table 1 and figure [ fig_lightcurves ] , are affected neither by aperture and seeing - dependent contributions from the host galaxy starlight nor by weather - related flux calibration issues ( though instrument - related flux calibration uncertainties are still possible ) .",
    "sampling the ionizing flux responsible for producing the emission line flux is not possible due to galactic absorption , but the nuv continuum is the closest proxy we have and can therefore provide insight into the changes in the ionizing continuum .",
    "we find that the flux at 1450  followed the same trends as in the optical , demonstrating a significant , factor of 4@xmath15 , increase in flux between 1982 and 1991 , followed by a decline in flux of nearly a factor of 100 between 1991 and 2013 .",
    "interestingly , the slope of the uv continuum , at least over this relatively short wavelength range , has remained relatively constant , unlike the optical continuum slope , insofar as it can be judged from the power - law fits .",
    "similar trends are present in the new and archival x - ray data and are visible in figure  [ fig_lightcurves ] .",
    "we performed spectral fitting of the _ chandra _ data shown in figure [ fig_xrayspec ] using the ciao fitting package _ sherpa_. the intrinsic continuum of the source is well - fit with an absorbed ( @xmath25  @xmath17 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) power law .",
    "the 0.5@xmath18 kev power - law slope fit to our new observations is @xmath261.52@xmath270.12 for the meg spectrum and @xmath261.53@xmath270.14 for the zeroth order spectrum .",
    "these are consistent with each other and with the value of @xmath261.58@xmath270.15 measured from the the high state spectrum from 2004 ( both shown in figure  [ fig_xrayspec ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic absorption in both cases is consistent with zero ; we find intrinsic @xmath28  @xmath17 for the meg spectrum and @xmath29  @xmath17 for the zeroth order spectrum , with lower limit pegged at zero in both cases .",
    "we measured the flux to be @xmath30erg  s@xmath11  @xmath17 over 0.5@xmath110kev .",
    "this measured x - ray flux is lower by an order of magnitude compared to 2004 _ chandra _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and also shown in figure [ fig_xrayspec ] ) and _ xmm _ observations @xcite , the latter of which show a 2@xmath110kev flux similar to that measured with _ suzaku _",
    "observations as recently as 2011 @xcite , though the soft - excess observed earlier had disappeared during the _ suzaku _ observations .",
    "these 2004 observations , in turn , are nearly an order of magnitude lower than the combined x - ray flux from ( 1 ) 0.1@xmath12.4kev observations taken in 1991 as part of the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ( 2 ) 2@xmath110kev exosat observations from 1984 @xcite .",
    "we take the combined rass+exosat flux shown in figure  [ fig_lightcurves ] as a lower limit to the expected soft@xmath31hard flux for the epoch @xmath01990 ( the point appears at the average calendar year and the x - axis error bar spans the range between the two observations ) .",
    "this is because the optical and uv data suggest the continuum luminosity was rising throughout the 1980s , so that the 1984 exosat flux is likely underestimated compared what may have been expected if observations had been taken @xmath06 years later .",
    "all x - ray fluxes are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we have been also awarded an additional 70ks of _ chandra _ time to observe mrk590 again later this cycle , the results of which will appear in a future contribution .    while we have not yet been able to locate spectra taken between the years 1996 and 2003 , the magnum telescope photometrically monitored the continuum variability of mrk590 from 2001 sept 11  2007 aug 8 .",
    "we can therefore use this and previous monitoring data ( particularly that of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to comment on the continuum variability trends over the last couple of decades .",
    "the magnum light curves are presented by @xcite and show that the amplitude of variability of mrk590 was not as large as other typical seyferts ( e.g. , ngc4151 and ngc5548 ) monitored by the same program .",
    "nonetheless , mrk590 continued to exhibit variability typical of this agn luminosity regime , i.e. , relatively larger amplitude , secular variability over longer , inter - year time scales , as well as smaller amplitude , more rapid , intra - year variability patterns . the maximum _",
    "b_-band flux over this period occurred around jd2453300  2004 oct  and was similar to the flux at the start of the magnum observations .",
    "by the end of the magnum observations , the broad h@xmath3  emission had disappeared , as seen in figure [ fig_allspec ] , but the _ b_-band flux was only @xmath015% lower than the maximum 2004 level , and the magnum light curves show neither a steady decline nor even a leveling off of the continuum to a constant flux by the end of the monitoring period .",
    "so despite the lack of broad lines and the relatively lower mean luminosity compared to when the broad lines were strong , the continuum variability behavior was relatively normal for a sy1 of this luminosity and black hole mass .",
    "similarly , the continuum light curves from the reverberation mapping campaign of @xcite are not particularly enlightening with regard to the transformation of mrk590 , except that the agn simply appears to be in a higher luminosity / accretion state over this time period .",
    "the observed variability is larger in amplitude than the magnum campaign , but still well within typical for moderate luminosity agn .",
    "furthermore , there are no apparent ` flaring ' events , such as that observed in ngc2617 @xcite , at least within the data we have collected .",
    "it therefore is unlikely that this intriguing transformation of mrk590 could easily have been gleaned simply from optical / nir broadband monitoring , likely due to contamination from the host galaxy in the optical .",
    "figure [ fig_zoomspec ] shows a zoomed - in view of the h@xmath3  and [ oiii]@xmath32  emission lines from the starlight- and continuum- ( where applicable ) subtracted optical spectra presented in figure [ fig_allspec ] .",
    "significant changes in the emission - line properties are obvious in both the broad and narrow emission lines .",
    "the most dramatic change is the initial strengthening and then complete disappearance of the broad h@xmath3  line .",
    "this trend is also visible in the narrow emission - line - subtracted h@xmath3  light curve shown with the open red circles in figure [ fig_lightcurves ] , where the final 3 epochs shown as upper limits are from the recent mods1 , kosmos , and 2014 mdm spectra , where the broad h@xmath3  line is no longer visible in the spectrum . generally speaking , broad emission - line profile changes",
    "are not particularly informative , given our current understanding of the blr .",
    "significant changes are well - known to occur over long timescales and in objects that have not `` turned off '' as mrk590 appears to have done .",
    "the flux of the broad lines also naturally varies over time , so , for example , the changes observed within the rm campaign spectra from 1989 , 1993 , and 1996 are typical for sy1s .",
    "however , the dramatic changes observed here , i.e. , between 1973 and 1989 and again between 1996 and 2013 , are likely connected to the dramatic changes occurring on similar timescales in the level of the agn continuum flux .",
    "these observed changes have been predicted from photoionization modeling of the blr , which demonstrates that the equivalent widths and responsivity of the optical recombination lines vary with the incident continuum flux .",
    "furthermore , find that optical depth effects within the blr predict larger responsivities for higher order balmer lines compared to the lower order lines , with the effect being a steepening ( flattening ) of the broad - line balmer decrement in low ( high ) continuum states .",
    "these results predict the variation of the intermediate seyfert type ( 1.5@xmath11.9 ) over large changes in the continuum flux , as observed in these changing type seyferts , such at ngc4151 , ngc2617 , possibly ngc2992 , and here in mrk590 .",
    "while the broad emission line flux changes are the most dramatic , the relative changes in the nlr emission lines are actually the most intriguing , as well as physically enlightening , and allow a possible history of the central region of mrk590 to be at least partially assembled .",
    "narrow line fluxes are given in table 1 and the [ oiii]@xmath145007 emission line light curve is shown in figure [ fig_lightcurves ] , both of which demonstrate that the [ oiii]@xmath145007 flux varied significantly across these four decades .",
    "reverberation mapping studies have shown that while the blr emission is variable on relatively short timescales  hours to weeks  the nlr emission remains constant over much longer timescales because of the radial distance from the central source to the nlr , geometric damping or smoothing of any variability due to the large spatial extent of the nlr , and long recombination times due to the low densities in the nlr .",
    "the nlr will not `` reverberate '' in response to small changes in the ionizing continuum emission as the blr does .",
    "narrow - line variability has only been previously noted in the literature a couple of times .",
    "@xcite report changes in narrow lines flux and flux ratios , but only for narrow line radio galaxies , and @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite measure changes in the narrow - line fluxes in radio - loud agn 3c390.3 . in the case of the latter object , the narrow line fluxes",
    "are observed to decline within only @xmath33 months of the continuum decline , and @xcite and @xcite suggest the narrow - line emission in this source may not only be exceptionally compact and dense , but also be affected by the jet , which is known to produce a beamed component of the continuum emission .",
    "it was demonstrated only recently by @xcite that the nlr emission in a radio quiet agn , ngc5548 , does vary over long time scales , i.e. , a few to tens of years , and responds to large changes in the ionizing continuum with a damping , or smoothing , time scale of @xmath015 years for this object .",
    "we observe similar changes in the narrow - line flux in mrk590 .",
    "our absolute flux calibration is admittedly somewhat uncertain for many of our optical spectra , but the general trend seen and the magnitude of the changes are too large to be accounted for by the expected flux uncertainties , which are likely a couple tens of percent , at most .",
    "the fluxes in table 1 show that the nlr emission increased by a factor of @xmath02 over @xmath020 years ( 1973@xmath11989 ) , coincident with the increase in continuum and broad emission - line flux .",
    "it then entered a stable phase for @xmath01@xmath12 decades , serendipitously contemporaneous with the rm campaign monitoring of @xcite .",
    "the relative stability during this period is based on the 2003 sdss spectrum and 17 spectra taken during jd2448514@xmath1jd2450122 ( 1991 sept.@xmath11996 feb ) under photometric conditions .",
    "emission - line flux measurements made from these 18 spectra demonstrate the rms deviations in the mean [ oiii]@xmath145007 flux was only 4.3% .",
    "the flux has since decreased again by a factor of @xmath02 in the past 10 years .",
    "we see the same general trends in the uv emission lines , with the exception that weak , broad iv civ  and ly@xmath2  components are still clearly visible in the recent cos spectrum . because the blr is ionization stratified , these emission lines originate nearer the central source than the h@xmath3  emission that has completely disappeared .",
    "the availability of uv observations is limited by the difficulty of obtaining such data , and as such , the spectra we present are the only available .",
    "it is therefore more difficult to put constraints on ( 1 ) the timescales with which the broad uv emission lines have declined , ( 2 ) how well they track the decline in optical emission lines , and ( 3 ) whether there truly is an ionization dependence on the remaining presence of broad line emission .",
    "one possible explanation for the remaining broad emission is simply one of equivalent width .",
    "we note that a possible , weak h@xmath2  broad component also remains in our most recent optical spectra .",
    "nonetheless , we see no evidence of broad heii  in the optical ( @xmath144686 ) or the uv ( @xmath141640 ) . if the ionizing continuum has simply become so weak that the line luminosities have become equivalently weak , then the lower equivalent width lines will ` disappear ' before the higher equivalent width lines , but a complete blr ( both low and high ionization lines ) may still remain intact below our detection limit .    on the other hand , we can put the ( near ) disappearance of the optical broad lines in context to theoretical models discussed above , if , for instance , the accretion rate of mrk590 has dropped below the limit necessary for the production of a blr .",
    "we estimate the bolometric agn luminosity from the 1450  continuum flux to be @xmath34erg s@xmath11 , from the 2013 cos spectrum .",
    "this is still orders of magnitude above the advection dominated limit suggested by , which for mrk590 is @xmath35erg s@xmath11 , and is also not yet below the limit assumed by @xcite of @xmath36erg s@xmath11 for the black hole mass of mrk590 .",
    "however , it is somewhat below the limit predicted by @xcite for the ionizing luminosity expected at the minimum accretion rate necessary to support a disk - wind blr  @xmath37erg s@xmath11 for the black hole mass of mrk590  where , based on our bolometric luminosity and that approximately 24% of the bolometric luminosity is emitted with wavelengths below 912 , we find @xmath38erg s@xmath11 . such a result would suggest a physical explanation for the disappearing broad lines if , indeed , the accretion rate has dropped below that necessary for generating a radiation pressure - supported and -driven wind",
    "however , the reader should keep in mind that these approximations of @xmath39 and @xmath40 have significant uncertainties , so care should be taken in interpreting these results .",
    "additionally , such interpretations make it difficult to explain the remaining broad components in iv civ , ly@xmath2 , and h@xmath2 , if the h@xmath3  broad line has disappeared as a result of the central engine entering a radiatively inefficient accretion state after this significant decrease in luminosity .",
    "furthermore , the maximum line width we measure from our data is @xmath09000 km s@xmath11 for the weak , broad emission component of iv civ  from the 2013 cos spectrum , suggesting that the blr velocities are nowhere near the @xmath41v@xmath4220,000@xmath125,000 km s@xmath11 limits discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , if the luminosity of mrk590 continues its downward trend , it may soon enter these interesting regimes if even the h@xmath2  and uv broad lines continue to disappear .",
    "an additional serendipitous investigation we can perform with the recent uv and optical data ( 2013 mods1 and cos spectra ) that show only very weak or non - existent broad emission components is to probe nlr line ratios of both the high and low ionization lines .",
    "many narrow lines are typically ` contaminated ' by the broad - line emission , such that the similarities and differences between sy1 and sy2 line ratios are not well studied , particularly for rest frame uv lines such as ly@xmath2  and iv civ , where not only are observations harder to obtain but absorption is also a problem .",
    "we fit the ly@xmath2  and iv civ  emission lines in the cos spectrum first with a broad 6th order gauss - hermite ( gh ) polynomial , masking over the narrow line core and any other non - blr line - specific emission in the profiles ( e.g. , ly@xmath2  and oi@xmath141301 geocoronal emission , nv ) .",
    "we subtracted this component and then fit the residual narrow emission component of each line with a new gh polynomial profile , from which we measure the presumed nlr contribution to the flux .",
    "the broad and total profile models are shown in red in figure [ fig_uvspec ] for each of these lines .",
    "we find the following observed line strengths , relative to narrow h@xmath3 , for these and other common narrow emission lines in the optical / uv : ly@xmath2  40.26 ; iv civ  13.50 ; heii@xmath141640 0.23 ; [ oiii]@xmath145007 12.52 ; h@xmath2  2.75 .",
    "rest - frame uv narrow - line components were detected and ratios reported for one other type 1 agn , 3c390.3 @xcite , but given the lower resolution and s / n of that data and the fact that narrow - line fluxes in this object may be affected by jet effects @xcite , a comparison with the present results is of questionable merit .",
    "on the other hand , our measured values are very similar to the relative intensities given by for sy2 spectra .",
    "this could indicate that the nlr line ratios of sy1s and sy2s are intrinsically similar .",
    "however , it could instead be possible that sy1 and sy2 ratios are intrinsically different , but by virtue of the transition mrk590 is experiencing , we have simply recovered the ratios expected for the state that mrk590 appears to be subsuming , i.e. , a sy2 .",
    "a final note of interest is simply that we detect a significant narrow emission component of iv civ .",
    "there has been extensive discussion in the literature about whether a `` true '' narrow , or more accurately , an nlr component of iv civ  exists ( i.e. , that emitted co - spatially with forbidden lines from a low - density , very spatially extended gas distribution ) .",
    "this is of particular interest for estimating black hole masses based on iv civ , as this affects the necessity ( or not ) for subtraction of such a component from the observed iv civ  profile .",
    "the cos spectrum in figure 2 clearly shows such a component in mrk590 , and the line strengths given in table 1 show it to be as strong as [ oiii]@xmath145007 .",
    "the fwhm of this and other narrow emission line components from the optical / uv spectra , also given in table 1 , demonstrate that while this iv civ  component is `` narrow '' , neither the iv civ  nor ly@xmath2  integrated narrow emission - line flux are being emitted co - spatially with the integrated emission from the other narrow forbidden or balmer lines .",
    "instead , taking the velocity widths as virial velocities suggests the narrow iv civ - emitting gas resides roughly a factor of 3 closer to the nucleus than that emitting [ oiii]@xmath145007 .",
    "this supports the argument that such emission is coming from an `` inner '' narrow line region ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and discussion by @xcite ) and should therefore be removed prior to blr line width measurements .",
    "however , defining and separating such a contribution to a iv civ  profile such as that visible in the mrk590 iue spectra , for example , has historically been the difficulty .",
    "therefore , reliably subtracting it in the presence of a strong broad emission component without an unblended template for the velocity width , which does not exist , remains problematic .",
    "the closest proxy would be using the approach of crenshaw et al .",
    ", who have previously used the narrow component of heii@xmath141640 as a template for a narrow iv civ  component .",
    "our narrow line - width measurements here suggest this approach is better than using a forbidden narrow emission line , but we still find the fwhm of heii  to be narrower than that of iv civ .",
    "furthermore , crenshaw et al .  have typically used this method with very high quality ( typically low redshift , space - based ) data ; however , the intensity of narrow heii  is much weaker than that of iv civ  ( by a factor of @xmath0150 ) , so application of this method to high - redshift agn spectra , where assessing the uncontaminated blr velocity from iv civ  is most desirable for black hole mass estimates , would be , unfortunately , tenuous at best .",
    "the seeming ability of objects like mrk590 to transition between type 1 and type 2 without an otherwise obvious flaring event like what @xcite observed in ngc2617 raises the question of what assigning a type is really saying about an agn .",
    "it is possible that such classifications should be taken as more of a statement of current ` state ' rather than a true , fixed ` type ' , as mrk 590 further indicates that type can change .",
    "this distinction may be of particular importance since it is becoming apparent that whether a particular agn appears at any given time to be type 1 or type 2 ( or somewhere in between ) may be saying something more significant about the agn physics and the immediate environment of the black hole at that particular time than strictly about the viewing angle . for mrk590 , the decrease in the blr , the uv , and the x - ray emission all seem to point to a decrease in total luminosity , thus accretion rate , and not simply a change in obscuration .",
    "furthermore , the dynamical timescale of the h@xmath3  emitting region is roughly 8 yrs in the rest frame of mrk590 , based on the black hole mass and h@xmath3  fwhm given by @xcite .",
    "an optically thick medium capable of occulting the blr could only reside outside the dust sublimation radius and would therefore have a much longer dynamical timescale .",
    "yet , the broad h@xmath3  emission transformed from strong to non - existent in @xmath4310 years ( 19962006 ) .",
    "furthermore , we see a dramatic change in the strength of not only the blr emission but also the continuum and the nlr emission .",
    "if obscuration were responsible for this , the obscuring medium would need to cover both our line of sight to the continuum source , in which case we may expect to see evidence of an obscurer in our x - ray continuum model , which we do not , as well as that between the continuum and the nlr , which is highly improbable .",
    "therefore , though it can not be definitively ruled out , line of sight obscuration is an unlikely explanation for the observations we present here . in general , the acquisition of sufficient data to determine the bolometric luminosity and spectral energy distribution of an agn before and after a change in type should be able to distinguish between these two physical origins for the change .",
    "changes in accretion rate should affect the flux at all wavelengths . however , flux changes due to obscuration will be wavelength dependent , where the decrease in uv / optical emission will be countered by an increase in the mid - to - far ir flux , since the obscuring medium absorbs the higher energy photons but then reradiates them as thermal emission at these long wavelengths .",
    "a more likely explanation for the suite of observations presented here is that an accretion event occurred 40@xmath31 years ago .",
    "this event was capable of stimulating the production of ionizing photons that have excited the blr emission over the subsequent 40 years .",
    "however , the energy produced in such an event has now been depleted .",
    "the symmetry of the narrow emission lines and the time scales over which we see significant changes in both the broad and narrow emission lines are too short for it to be plausible that this accretion event actually created these regions , i.e. , to initially form and light up the agn from a quiescent state .",
    "instead , it is likely that at least the bulk of the nuclear gas was already present , just not emitting significant broad - line emission .",
    "this suggests that the appearance of a blr may be episodic over the accretion history of supermassive black holes , depending on the reservoir of material available in the nucleus for accretion .",
    "it further demonstrates the importance of repeat observations of larger samples of seyfert galaxies over longer baselines as a means to better quantify how often this behavior may occur .",
    "transition objects like mrk590 may also be a link to other ` abnormal ' agn found from large survey samples .",
    "for example , @xcite found unusual broad - line objects among the boss sample of luminous galaxies that show a broad mgii  emission line component but little to no broad balmer emission .",
    "an interesting possibility is that these objects are in a similar transition state as mrk590 .",
    "unfortunately , a recent spectrum of the mgii  region in mrk590 has not yet been obtained , so more data are needed to connect the likely time variable nature of the broad balmer lines in mrk590 with this larger class of objects .",
    "we have been awarded time to obtain a spectrum of the mgii  region in mrk590 with _",
    "hst _  in cycle 21 for this purpose and will therefore be able to address this in future work .    under the assumption that the observed behavior of mrk590 _ was _ the consequence of a past accretion event , we can infer additional physical properties of this system .",
    "the blr would have known and responded to a new accretion event almost instantaneously , given the h@xmath3  radius of @xmath010@xmath120 light days @xcite and the short recombination time in this region .",
    "however , this is not the case for gas at the distance and densities of the nlr .",
    "the behavior and subsequent properties of the [ oiii]@xmath32  lines , as well as the heterogeneous data in our sample , allow us to put various independent limits on the nlr radius .",
    "one of the weakest , but nonetheless most reliable constraints on the nlr size comes from the fact that we measure nearly identical [ oiii ] fluxes from the 2003 sdss spectrum as we do from the large aperture rm campaign spectra taken in the 1990 s .",
    "this indicates that most of the [ oiii ] emission must arise from the spatially unresolved region with a 1.7kpc diameter  the physical size subtended by the sdss aperture at the distance of mrk590 .",
    "next , insofar as we can rely on the observed increase of the [ oiii]@xmath145007 flux by 40% between 1973 and 1983 , light travel time arguments suggest that the nlr emission must be @xmath18pc from the central source .",
    "in addition , the fluxes measured from the 2003 sdss spectrum show that the continuum and blr emission had significantly declined already , yet the [ oiii ] flux has not yet changed . however , the [ oiii ] flux _ had _ diminished by the time the 2006 mdm spectrum was obtained ( again assuming at least some amount of trust in this flux measurement ) .",
    "thus , even if this decline began right after the final rm campaign [ oiii ] flux calibration spectrum was obtained , we deduce a light travel timescale of @xmath4310 years , consistent with the distance inferred from the earlier increase in flux .",
    "next , we briefly consider the velocities of the [ oiii]-emitting gas , though the evidence for such a discussion is less robust than that derived from the fluxes .",
    "this is because large ( @xmath0100 ^-1 km s@xmath11 ) systematic errors in the velocity widths derived from individual spectra taken through large spectroscopic apertures are possible .",
    "this is on account of the difficulty involved in accurately measuring and correcting for the spectral resolution given that the psf does not fill the slit .",
    "measure the [ oiii]@xmath145007 velocity width to be 397@xmath2722 ^ -1 km s@xmath11  from a high ( 23 ^ -1 km s@xmath11 ) resolution spectrum taken sometime between 1980 june and 1981 july .",
    "this is consistent with our resolution corrected velocities , for the most part .",
    "if we at least assume that these velocities approximately represent the virial velocity at the radius of the nlr , this also indicates consistent distances with other limits we considered above , with velocities @xmath0250@xmath1550 km s@xmath11 corresponding to distances of @xmath00.7@xmath13.3pc .",
    "while we regrettably can not trust the reliability of the 1973 line width measurement , it is notably larger than the other measurements .",
    "this could lead to the interesting , though highly speculative , consideration that with this early observation , we are actually observing the nlr ` lighting up ' from the inside out as the agn continuum luminosity begins to increase significantly .",
    "assuming a 10@xmath44 k gas , the recombination time for gas near the critical density of [ oiii]@xmath32  will be on the order of days ; however , as the density drops with increasing radius to the expected average density of the nlr of @xmath02000 @xmath45 @xcite , the recombination time approaches a decade .",
    "such effects could lead to a scenario in which we see narrow - line emission only from the higher - velocity , more dense gas in the innermost regions of the nlr as the agn continuum first brightens , and only after years will the velocity widths of the integrated [ oiii]-emitting gas decrease as the spatial extent of the emission increases .",
    "certainly , the range of velocities measured from the narrow component of the various emission lines we consider , which are significantly larger than the line width uncertainties , indicate that `` narrow '' emission line gas is emitted from an extended spatial region with a density gradient .",
    "the innermost emission from the high ionization species , such as iv civ , ly@xmath2 , and heii  is coming from well within sub - pc scales .    finally , to complete the picture of events , our observations",
    "indicate that as the agn continuum luminosity increased ( decreased ) , the blr emission strengthened ( diminished ) faster than the nlr emission .",
    "this behavior suggests the spatial propagation of information from the central source outward because of density effects and light travel time .",
    "this again implies that an  event \" of some sort may have triggered the creation of enough ionizing photons to excite the observed changes in blr emission and subsequent strengthening of the nlr emission ( as discussed above ) .",
    "there is nothing in the observations that can yet point to  what \" may have been accreted to cause the observed sequence of events .",
    "however , we can _ roughly _ estimate the total mass needed to power the bolometric luminosity integrated over the span of our observations with a simple , back of the envelope calculation .",
    "we take the 5100  fluxes from all optical spectra shown in figure  [ fig_allspec ] ( values in table 1 ) and convert these to bolometric luminosities assuming a bolometric correction of 8.10 @xcite .",
    "we then estimate the integrated luminosity both under the rough continuum emission light curve shown in figure [ fig_lightcurves ] and by extending the observed rise and decline , modeled as gaussian wings , to both the past and future to conservatively cover a temporal range from 1950 to 2020 . finally , assuming that the mass - to - energy conversion efficiency is 7% , we find that the observed continuum output during this event can be accounted for with only @xmath01@xmath12@xmath46 of total mass being accreted over these 70 years .",
    "we have presented optical , uv , and x - ray observations of the ` classical ' seyfert 1 mrk590 that span the past 40 + years . this interesting object brightened by a factor of 10 s between the 1970 s and 1990 s and then faded by a factor of a 100 or more at all continuum wavelengths between the mid-1990 s and present day .",
    "notably , there is no evidence in the current data set that this recent , significant decline in flux is due to obscuration ; in particular , the most recent x - ray observations are consistent with zero intrinsic absorption .",
    "there were similarly dramatic changes in the emission - line fluxes .",
    "the most striking change is the complete disappearance of the broad component of the h@xmath3  emission line , which had previously been strong ( equivalent widths @xmath020@xmath160  ) and the focus of a successful reverberation mapping campaign that resulted in a secure estimate of the supermassive black hole contained within the nucleus of mrk590 of @xmath47 . as a result of these significant changes ,",
    "the optical spectrum of mrk590 currently looks more like that of a sy2 agn , with predominantly only narrow emission lines and a strong host galaxy stellar continuum .",
    "the changes in emission line properties over this time period allowed us to determine that mrk590 , at least in its current state , has nlr emission line ratios that are similar to those measured in sy2 spectra .",
    "we were also able to put limits on the radius of the [ oiii]-emitting region of the nlr to be @xmath00.7@xmath13.3pc based on the observed changes in the integrated line flux and the velocity width of [ oiii]@xmath145007 .",
    "these results are consistent with the nlr size determined by @xcite for ngc5548 , another nearby sy1 galaxy containing a bh of similar mass to mrk590",
    ".    the implications arising from this long time series of mrk 590 are that ( 1 ) mrk590 is a direct challenge to the historical paradigm that agn type is exclusively a geometrical effect , and ( 2 ) there may not be a strict , one - way evolution from type 1 to type 1.5@xmath11.9 to type 2 as recently suggested by @xcite . instead , for at least some objects , the presence of blr emission may coincide only with episodic accretion events throughout a single active phase of an agn .",
    "if true , such behavior may be more prominent in seyfert galaxies , where accretion has been theorized to be a consequence of secular processes and therefore likely more episodic than quasar activity , which may be triggered more predominantly by major mergers ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the final possibility , of course , is that we are witnessing the final stages in the life of this agn , and mrk590 is completely turning off .",
    "this would be an incredible find , but is likely the most improbable explanation , given the low duty cycles for low redshift agn .",
    "we plan to continue monitoring mrk590 to look for further changes in its current state , but only time and more observations will tell whether the blr returns .",

    "<S> we present multi - wavelength observations that trace more than 40 years in the life of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) in mrk590 , traditionally known as a classic seyfert 1 galaxy . from spectra </S>",
    "<S> recently obtained from _ hst _ , _ chandra _ , and the large binocular telescope , we find that the activity in the nucleus of mrk590 has diminished so significantly that the continuum luminosity is a factor of 100 lower than the peak luminosity probed by our long baseline observations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the broad emission lines , once prominent in the uv / optical spectrum , have all but disappeared . </S>",
    "<S> since agn type is defined by the presence of broad emission lines in the optical spectrum , our observations demonstrate that mrk590 has now become a `` changing look '' agn . </S>",
    "<S> if classified by recent optical spectra , mrk590 would be a seyfert @xmath01.9@xmath12 , where the only broad emission line still visible in the optical spectrum is a weak component of h@xmath2 . as an additional consequence of this change , we have definitively detected uv narrow - line components in a type 1 agn , allowing an analysis of these emission - line components with high - resolution cos spectra . </S>",
    "<S> these observations challenge the historical paradigm that agn type is only a consequence of the line of sight viewing angle toward the nucleus in the presence of a geometrically - flattened , obscuring medium ( i.e. , the torus ) . </S>",
    "<S> our data instead suggest that the current state of mrk 590 is a consequence of the change in luminosity , which implies the black hole accretion rate has significantly decreased . </S>"
