    "the study of various decay and formation modes of the @xmath1 quark is a main source of information about ckm matrix elements and a field for understanding perturbative and nonperturbative qcd effects . in particular , heavy - to - light decays are interesting because they give information on @xmath2 , but they are especially difficult to calculate because of the essential presence of strong interactions in the hadronic bound state .",
    "the form factors parameterizing the relevant hadronic matrix elements in the heavy - to - light transitions are nonperturbative quantities , which must be estimated in some nonperturbative theoretical approaches . in this",
    "regards , the precise calculation of the form factors is provided by lattice simulations .",
    "another fruitful approach has been the application of qcd sum rules on the light - cone @xcite .",
    "the method of light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) is a hybrid of the standard technique of qcd sum rules  la svz @xcite , with the conventional distribution amplitude description of the hard exclusive process @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of svz sum rules is that using vacuum condensates to parameterize the nontrivial qcd vacuum and employing the duality hypothesis to relate the experimental observable to the theoretical calculation .",
    "technically , operator product expansion ( ope ) based on the canonical dimension is used .",
    "the difference between svz sum rules and lcsr is that the short - distance wilson ope in increasing dimension is replaced by the light - cone expansion in terms of distribution amplitudes of increasing twist .",
    "the main nonperturbative parameter in lcsr is the distribution amplitude , also called wave function , which corresponds to the sum of an infinite series of operators with the same twist . in practical application",
    "the correlation function considered in lcsr is a @xmath3 product inserted between physical state and vacuum , which is to be compared to the correlation function between vacuum in the svz sum rules .",
    "the main contribution to this type of correlation function comes from the light - cone . using vacuum condensate to characterize the qcd vacuum corresponding to the mean field approximation , and this is valid when the momentum transfer is not so large .",
    "when the momentum transfer becomes larger , this approximation can not be correct everywhere . to this end",
    ", the condensates must be replace by the distribution amplitudes , which embodies the fast variation of the field .",
    "although the lcsr approach does involve a certain model dependence and the leading - order sum rules may not be very accurate , this technique offers an important advantage of being fully consistent with qcd perturbation theory . in recent years",
    "there have been numerous applications of lcsr to mesons including the determination of the form factors and the calculations of hadron matrix elements @xcite , see @xcite for a review . in compliance with the heavy quark symmetry @xcite , lcsr within the framework of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )",
    "has also been formulated and achieved fruitful results .",
    "the hqet light - cone sum rules have been applied to deal with the strong couplings of heavy hadrons and heavy - to - light transitions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the lcsr approach to study the exclusive semileptonic decay @xmath0 . unlike the meson cases ,",
    "the applications of lcsr to baryons have received little attention because of the lack of knowledge about the distribution amplitudes of higher twists . recently",
    "a comprehensive investigation for the baryonic distribution amplitudes has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite , which makes the calculation of baryon form factors from the lcsr approach feasible .",
    "the study for the exclusive semileptonic @xmath4 decay into proton can be found in the literatures by using various approaches such as the svz sum rules @xcite , the quark model @xcite and perturbative qcd factorization theorems @xcite .",
    "the existing theoretical predictions vary from each other , and can differ even by orders of magnitude . here",
    "we shall investigate the @xmath5 decay in lcsr and calculate the form factors of the decay within both the framework of full qcd and hqet .",

    ". however , the total decay widths with sum rule obtained distribution amplitudes in the hqet are typically one order smaller than those in the full qcd .",
    "what remarkable here is that the asymptotic hqet and full qcd results are almost the same with the fitted form factors , cf .",
    "tables [ tdw - fqcd ] and [ tdw - hqet ] . as for the physical behavior of the distribution amplitudes , the current experimental data is not enough to discriminate which one , between the asymptotic and the qcd sum rule obtained , is correct in this kinematical region , because the total decay widths corresponding to different distribution amplitudes do not deviate from each other greatly , though the predicted behaviors for the form factors are completely different .",
    "moreover , the @xmath263 correction to the lcsr , which amounts to the hard gluon exchange mechanism , is needed as a complete description for the decay in the full qcd .",
    "as to the hqet case , our results are merely preliminary and further improvements , which including order @xmath264 corrections in the heavy quark expansion and radiative corrections , are needed to reconcile the existing discrepancy between the hqet and full qcd results . finally , it is worth remarking that the light - cone expansion for the correlation function is not accessible at all momentum transfers .",
    "the restriction on @xmath28 is in the region @xmath265 .",
    "when @xmath28 becomes large or one gets too close to the physical states in the channel , light - cone expansion tends to break down .",
    "so the lcsr in the large @xmath28 region may be not reliable and can not give much information on the physical behavior or the form factors .",
    "the hqet case is similar , the only difference is that the expansion parameter is @xmath193 and correspondingly the restriction turns to be the lower limit of @xmath193 , thus soft proton will enhance the higher twist contributions .",
