    "media with strong dispersion of the refractive index may support backward waves , as is obvious from the following relation established by lord rayleigh in 1877 : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the group index for waves with wavelength @xmath2 phase velocity is @xmath3 , group velocity @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the light speed in vacuo .",
    "hence , the group velocity may become negative in a system with large positive dispersion .",
    "the structures that support backward waves have been known since early 1900s and widely used in antenna and electronics technologies since 1950s .",
    "media where the directions of phase and group velocities are opposite are known to produce negative refraction@xcite .",
    "it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that e.g. dispersion of light close to excitonic frequencies in solids can be negative .",
    "it is also true of artificial metamaterials with strong spatial dispersion , like photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "pafomov @xcite and veselago @xcite showed that backward waves can propagate in isotropic medium with simultaneously negative permittivity @xmath6 and permeability @xmath7 , exhibiting negative refraction , inverse doppler and vavilov - cherenkov effects .",
    "currently , such metamaterials are called negative index metamaterials ( nim ) .",
    "veselago has noticed that a slab of nim with thickness @xmath8 would work as a _",
    "flat lens_. the lens could not produce an image of a distant object , since it can not focus a parallel beam of light , but produces a replica of the object if it is placed less than distance @xmath9 away from the nearest surface of the slab .",
    "recently , unusual properties of nim systems attracted considerable attention followed first theoretical @xcite and then experimental @xcite  demonstration of feasibility of negative refraction by periodic metallic metamaterials like periodic wire meshes producing negative @xmath6 @xcite and split - ring resonators ( srr ) giving negative @xmath7 @xcite in microwave region of incident radiation .",
    "pendry has showed theoretically that ideal veselago lens can produce sub - wavelength resolution ( _ perfect lens _ ) @xcite .",
    "the effect appears because ideal nim slab supports surface plasmon modes that are in resonance with incident radiation at any angles of incidence@xcite .",
    "the incident field pumps those plasmon modes up and this lead to enhancement of evanescent waves reaching the surface on the image side of the slab further from the source .",
    "the induced displacement currents re - emit the light that reconstructs the image of the source without loss of resolution for features smaller than @xmath10 .",
    "similar effect involving surface plasmons is also responsible for extraordinary transmission in thin metallic hole arrays@xcite .",
    "this behavior is quite fragile , however , and limited by losses and spatial dispersion ( metamaterials granularity)@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has indeed been demonstrated experimentally by lagarkov and kissel that the nim slab built with srr interspersed with the wire mesh is able to resolve features @xmath11 in the source separated by for microwave radiation ( @xmath12ghz)@xcite .",
    "later on , the sub - wavelength resolution ( @xmath13 was demonstrated by n. fang _",
    "et al_. in the visible range using silver slab as a plasmonic medium@xcite .",
    "the silver slab is not a material with both permittivity and permeability negative ( _ double negative ) _ , it only has @xmath14 as any metal at frequencies below plasmon frequency , and @xmath15 but the effect is still possible because the system is in quasistatic limit where the sign of permeability @xmath7 drops out of the result for image intensity@xcite .",
    "various papers describe metamaterials that show nim - like response at far infrared frequencies@xcite and , most interestingly , in near - optical and optical interval@xcite .",
    "the metallic periodic systems like ` fishnet ' structure @xcite support an infinite set ( bands ) of electromagnetic ( em ) waves , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the wavevector ( quasi - momentum ) , @xmath18 the number of the band ( floquet mode ) . at small wavevectors",
    "@xmath17 such a crystal can be characterized by effective permittivity @xmath6 and permeability @xmath19@xcite . because of strong dispersion , it is easy to find crystals where some of the higher bands ( second or third ) support backward waves corresponding to negative group velocity , see refs.@xcite .",
    "if such a band exists alone in a particular ( usually narrow ) frequency range , the crystal would operate as a nim at those frequencies . eleftheriades _",
    "et al_. have considered recently a possibility of an isotropic 3d nim crystals ( 3d transmission lines ) that might support backward waves in the first band if made of lumped capacitors and inductances , ref.@xcite , see fig .",
    "this is directly follows from the 3d transmission line ( tl ) model suggested by kron for maxwell equations in isotropic space with positive permittivity and permeability , @xmath20@xcite . in the case of ` positive ' medium",
    "the dispersion at small @xmath17-vectors is positive for the lowest energy band , where eigenfrequency @xmath21 is a growing function of @xmath17 .",
    "it should become a decreasing function of @xmath17 after a dual transformation of the tl .",
    "indeed , this is the standard passband - to - stopband transformation , where the dispersion remains exactly the same after a substitution @xmath22 with obvious replacement @xmath23 , which means that the group velocity for the dual band changes sign : @xmath24 the dual transformation does indeed result in negative dispersion in the doubly degenerate first band around the @xmath25 point @xcite .",
    "however , the kron tl lattice contains a few elements per unit cell and , as a consequence , there is also another ` spurious ' band present in the first brillouin zone .",
    "the 3d tl crystal can be fairly well impedance matched to free space in @xmath26ghz range and it supports a backward wave .",
    "the ` spurious ' band can couple to highly attenuated evanescent waves , but losses may be the limiting factor in subwavelength resolution experiment with dual kron s tl lattice rather than the coupling to the ` spurious ' band@xcite",
    ".    it would be interesting to find an implementation of the dual kron 3d transmission line model for nim in visible range . with this in mind , engheta _",
    "et al_. have speculated that ag nanoparticles can play a role similar to lumped inductance at optical frequencies .",
    "one can try , for instance , substituting lumped inductances by ag nanoparticles in the dual kron lattice , hoping that the capacitive coupling between the particles would bring about the same band structure as in 3d tl@xcite , see fig .",
    "the nanoparticle system in fig .",
    "1b is a poor representation of 3d tl system shown in fig .",
    "1a : although one does have both electric and magnetic response from metallic nanoparticles in ac field , they can not be considered as lumped circuit elements .",
    "indeed , the interaction between particles beyond nearest neighbors is likely important in open structures like kron s cubic lattice , in addition to their non - negligible self - capacitance .",
    "we have calculated the two cases : ( i ) lattice of ag spheres in vacuo ( dielectric constant of the matrix is unity , @xmath27 , and ( ii ) dielectric constant of the matrix is @xmath28 .",
    "the second case corresponds to experimentally accessible case of metallic spheres embedded in an organic matrix .",
