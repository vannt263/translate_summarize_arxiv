    "bitcoin is a digital currency alternative to the legal ones , as any other crypto currency . nowadays , bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency .",
    "it was created by a cryptologist known as `` satoshi nakamoto '' , whose real identity is still unknown @xcite . like other cryptocurrencies",
    ", bitcoin uses cryptographic techniques and , thanks to an open source system , anyone is allowed to inspect and even modify the source code of the bitcoin software .",
    "the bitcoin network is a peer - to - peer network that monitors and manages both the generation of new bitcoins and the consistency verification of transactions in bitcoins .",
    "this network is composed of a high number of computers connected to each other through the internet .",
    "they perform complex cryptographic procedures which generate new bitcoins ( mining ) and manage the bitcoin transactions register , verifying their correctness and truthfulness .",
    "mining is the process which allows to find the so called `` proof of work '' that validates a set of transactions and adds them to the massive and transparent ledger of every past bitcoin transaction known as the `` blockchain '' .",
    "the generation of bitcoins is the reward for the validation process of the transactions .",
    "the blockchain was generated starting since january 3 , 2009 by the inventor of the bitcoin system himself , satoshi nakamoto .",
    "the first block is called `` genesis block '' and contains a single transaction , which generates 50-bitcoin for the benefit of the creator of the block .",
    "the whole system is set up to yield just 21 million bitcoins by 2040 , and over time the process of mining will become less and less profitable . the main source of remuneration for the miners in the future will be the fees on transactions , and not the mining process itself .    in this work , we propose an agent - based model with the aim to study and analyse the mining process and the bitcoin market starting from september 1 , 2010 , the approximate date when miners started to buy mining hardware to mine bitcoins .",
    "the proposed model simulates the mining process and the bitcoin transactions , by implementing a mechanism for the formation of the bitcoin price , and specific behaviors for each typology of trader .",
    "we try to reproduce the generation of bitcoins , the main stylized facts present in the real bitcoin market and the economy of the mining process .",
    "the model described is built on a previous work of the authors @xcite , which modeled the bitcoin market under a purely financial perspective . in this work ,",
    "we fully consider also the economics of mining .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section _ related work _ we discuss other works related to this paper , in section _ mining process _",
    "we describe briefly the mining process and we give an overview on the mining hardware and on its evolution over time . in section _ the model _ we present the proposed model in detail . section _",
    "simulation results _ presents the values given to several parameters of the model and reports the results of the simulations , including an analysis of bitcoin real prices , and a robustness analysis .",
    "the conclusions of the paper are reported in section _",
    "conclusions_. finally , appendix deals with the calibration to some parameters of the model .",
    "the study and analysis of the cryptocurrency market is a relatively new field . in the last years",
    ", several papers appeared on this topic given its potential interest and the many issues related to it ( see for instance the works @xcite ) .",
    "however , very few works were made to model the cryptocurrencies market .",
    "we can cite the works by luther @xcite , who studied why some cryptocurrencies failed to gain widespread acceptance using a simple agent model ; by bornholdt et al .",
    "@xcite , who proposed a model based on moran process to study the cryptocurrencies able to emerge ; by garcia et al .",
    "@xcite , who studied the role of social interactions in the creation of price bubbles ; by kristoufek @xcite who analysed the main drivers of the bitcoin price ; and by kaminsky et al .",
    "@xcite who related the bitcoin market with its sentiment analysis on social networks .    in this paper",
    "we propose a complex agent - based model in order to reproduce the economy of the mining process and the main stylized facts of the bitcoin price series .",
    "our model is inspired by business , economic and financial agent - based models that depict how organizations , or in general the economy of a country , create , deliver , and capture value .    as regards the business models , amini et al .",
    "@xcite presented a agent - based model with the aim to analyze the impact of alternative production and sales policies on the diffusion of a new product ; cocco et al .",
    "@xcite proposed agent - based models to simulate the software market and analyze the business processes and policies adopted by proprietary software firms and open source software firms ; li et al .",
    "@xcite researched the dominant players behavior in supply chains and the relationship between the selling prices and purchasing prices in supply chains by using a multi - agent simulation model ; rohitratana et al .",
    "@xcite studied the pricing schemes of the market of the software as - a - service and on the market of the proprietary or traditional software ; finally , xiaoming et al .",
    "@xcite studied how a firm maximizes its profit by determining the production and sales policies for a new product during the lifetime of the product .    concerning economic models , in @xcite the authors presented one of the most significant agent - based model developed to date in order to study the european economy .",
    "in particular , they show how monetary policies , i.e , credit money supplied by commercial banks as loans to firms , influence the economy of a country . in @xcite agent",
    "based keynesian models are presented in order to investigate the properties of macro economic dynamics and the impact of public polices on supply , demand and the fundamentals of the economy , and to study the interactions between income distribution and monetary and fiscal policies .",
    "as regards artificial financial market models , they reproduce the real functioning of markets , trying to explain the main stylised facts observed in financial markets , such as the fat - tailed distribution of returns , the volatility clustering , and the unit - root property . for a review , see works @xcite and @xcite .",
    "raberto et al .",
    "@xcite and cincotti et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the genoa artificial stock market ( gasm ) an agent - based artificial financial market characterized by actual tracking of status and wealth of each agent , and by a realistic trading and price clearing mechanisms .",
    "gasm is able to reproduce some of the main stylised facts observed in real financial markets .",
    "this paper is built on gasm , adding specific features and a mix of zero - intelligence and trend - following traders with the aim to model the bitcoin exchange market and the economics of mining .",
    "today , every few minutes thousands of people send and receive bitcoins through the peer - to - peer electronic cash system created by satoshi nakamoto . all transactions are public and stored in a distributed database called blockchain which is used to confirm transactions and prevent the double - spending problem .",
    "people who confirm transactions of bitcoins and store them in the blockchain are called `` miners '' . as soon as new transactions are notified to the network",
    ", miners check their validity and authenticity and collect them in a block .",
    "then , they take the information contained in the block of the transactions , which include a variable number called `` nonce '' and run the sha-256 hashing algorithm on this block , turning the initial information into a sequence of 256 bits , known as hash @xcite .",
    "there is no way of knowing how this sequence will look before calculating it , and the introduction of a minor change in the initial data causes a drastic change in the resulting hash .    the miners can not change the data containing the information of transactions , but can change the `` nonce '' number used to create a different hash .",
    "the goal is to find a hash having a given number of leading zero bits .",
    "this number can be varied to change the difficulty of the problem . the first miner who creates a proper hash with success ( he finds the `` proof - of - work '' ) , gets a reward in bitcoins , and the successful hash",
    "is stored with the block of the validated transactions in the blockchain .    in a nutshell ,",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \" , @xcite .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the steps to run the network are the followings :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , @xcite .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    producing a single hash is computationally very easy , consequently in order to regulate the generation of bitcoins , over time the bitcoin protocol makes this task more and more difficult .",
    "the proof - of - work is implemented by incrementing the nonce in the block until a value is found that gives the block s hash with the required leading zero bits .",
    "if the hash does not match the required format , a new nonce is generated and the hash calculation starts again @xcite .",
    "countless attempts may be necessary before finding a nonce able to generate a correct hash .",
    "the computational complexity of the process necessary to find the proof - of - work is adjusted over time in such a way that the number of blocks found each day is more or less constant ( approximately 2016 blocks in two weeks , one every 10 minutes ) . in the beginning , each generated block corresponded to the creation of 50 bitcoins , this number being halved each four years , after 210,000 blocks additions .",
    "so , the miners have a reward equal to 50 bitcoins if the created blocks belong to the first 210,000 blocks of the blockchain , 25 bitcoins if the created blocks range from the 210,001th to the 420,000th block in the blockchain , 12.5 bitcoins if the created blocks range from the 420,001th to the 630,000th block in the blockchain , and so on .    over time , mining bitcoin is getting more and more complex , due to the increasing number of miners , and the increasing power of their hardware .",
    "we have witnessed the succession of four generations of hardware , i.e. cpu s , gpu s , fpga s and asic s generation , each of them characterized by a specific hash rate ( measured in h / sec ) and power consumption . with time , the power and the price of the mining hardware has been steadly increasing , though the price of h / sec has been decreasing . to face the increasing costs , miners are pooling together to share resources .      in january 3 , 2009 ,",
    "satoshi nakamoto created the first block of the blockchain , called `` genesis block '' , hashing on the central processing unit ( cpu ) of his computer .",
    "like him , the early miners mined bitcoin running the software on their personal computers .",
    "the cpu s era represents the first phase of the mining process , the other eras being gpu s , fpga s and asic s eras ( see web site https://tradeblock.com/blog/ + the - evolution - of - mining/ ) .",
    "each era announces the use of a specific typology of mining hardware .",
    "in the second era , started about on september 2010 , boards based on graphics processing unit ( gpu ) running in parallel entered the market , giving rise to the gpu era .    about in december 2011 ,",
    "the fpga s era started and hardware based on field programmable gate array cards ( fpga ) specifically designed to mine bitcoins was available in the market .",
    "finally , in 2013 fully customized application specific integrated circuit ( asic ) appeared , substantially increasing the hashing capability of the bitcoin network and marking the beginning of the fourth era .    over time , the different mining hardware available was characterized by an increasing hash rate , a decreasing power consumption per hash , and increasing costs . for example , nvidia quadro nvs 3100 m , 16 cores , belonging to the gpu generation , has a hash rate equal to 3.6 mh / s and a power consumption equal to 14 w @xcite ; modminer quad , belonging to the fpga generation , has a hash rate equal to 800 mh / s and power consumption equal to 40 w @xcite ; monarch(300 ) , belonging to the asic generation , has a hash rate equal to 300 gh / s and power consumption equal to 175 w ( see web site https://tradeblock.com / mining/.      the goal of our work is to model the economy of the mining process , so we neglected the first era , when bitcoins had no monetary value , and miners used the power available on their pcs , at almost no cost .",
    "we simulated only the remaining three generations of mining hardware .",
    "we gathered information about the products that entered the market in each era to model these three generations of hardware , in particular with the aim to compute :    * the average hash rate per us$ spent on hardware , @xmath0 , expressed in @xmath1 ; * the average power consumption per @xmath2 , @xmath3 , expressed in @xmath4 .    the average hash rate and",
    "the average power consumption were computed averaging the real market data at specific times and constructing two fitting curves .    to calculate the hash rate and the power consumption of the mining hardware of the gpu era , that we estimate ranging from september 1st , 2010 to september 29th , 2011",
    ", we computed an average for @xmath5 and @xmath6 taking into account some representative products in the market during that period , neglecting the costs of the motherboard .    in that era , motherboards with more than one peripheral component interconnect express ( pcie ) , started to enter the market allowing to install , by using adapters , multiple video cards in only one system and to mine criptocurrency , thanks to the power of the gpus . in table",

    "we extracted the data illustrated in table [ prodotti ] from the history of the web site _",
    "http://www.butterflylabs.com/ _ through the web site _",
    "web.archive.org._. for hardware in the market in 2014 and 2015 we referred to the bitmain technologies ltd company , and in particular , to the mining hardware called antminer ( see web site https://bitmaintech.com and table [ prodotti ] )",
    ".    starting from the mining products in each period ( see tables [ tab : gpu ] and [ prodotti ] ) , we fitted a `` best hash rate per $ '' and a `` best power consumption function '' ( see table [ average ] ) .",
    "we call the fitting curves @xmath0 and @xmath3 , respectively .",

    "[ r ] :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the fitting curve of the power consumption @xmath3 is also a general exponential model :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show in logaritmic scale the fitting curves and how the hash rate increases over time , whereas power consumtpion decreases .",
    "we used the _",
    "blockchain.info_ , a web site which displays detailed information about all transactions and bitcoin blocks , providing graphs and statistics on different data , for extracting the empirical data used in this work .",
    "this web site provides several graphs and statistical analysis of data about bitcoins .",
    "in particular , we can observe the time trend of the bitcoin price in the market , the total number of bitcoins , the total hash rate of the bitcoin network and the total number of bitcoin transactions .",
    "the proposed model presents an agent - based artificial cryptocurrency market in which agents mine , buy or sell bitcoins .",
    "we modeled the bitcoin market starting from september 1st , 2010 , because one of our goals is to study the economy of the mining process .",
    "it was only around this date that miners started to buy mining hardware to mine bitcoins , denoting a business interest in mining .",
    "previously , they typically just used the power available on their personal computers .",
    "the features of the model are :    * there are various kinds of agents active on the btc market : miners , random traders and chartists ; * the trading mechanism is based on a realistic order book that keeps sorted lists of buy and sell orders , and matches them allowing to fulfill compatible orders and to set the price ; * agents have typically limited financial resources , initially distributed following a power law ; * the number of agents engaged in trading at each moment is a fraction of the total number of agents ; * a number of new traders , endowed only with cash , enter the market ; they represent people who decided to start trading or mining bitcoins ; * miners belong to mining pools .",
    "this means that at each time @xmath13 they always have a positive probability to mine at least a fraction of bitcoin .",
    "indeed , since 2010 miners have been pooling together to share resources in order to be able avoiding effort duplication to optimally mine bitcoins .",
    "a consequence of this fact is that gains are smoothly distributed among miners .",

    "also , the wealth distribution in crypto cash of the traders in the market at initial time follows a zipf law .",
    "indeed , the wealth share in the world of bitcoin is even more unevenly distributed than in the world at large ( see web site http://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/owns-bitcoins-infographic-wealth-distribution/ ) .",

    "we assumed that miners in the market at initial time ( @xmath15 ) own a personal pc such as core i5 2600k , and hence they are initially endowed with a hashing capability @xmath21 equal to 0.0173gh / sec , that implies a power consumption equal to 75w @xcite .",

    "miners active in the simulation since the beginning will take their first decision within 60 days , at random times uniformly distributed .",
    "miners entering the simulation at time @xmath53 will immediately take this decision .",
    "in deeper detail , at time @xmath54 , every miner can decide to buy new hardware units , if her fiat cash is positive , and/or to divest the old hardware units .",
    "if trader s cash is zero , she issues a sell market order to get the cash to support her electricity expenses , @xmath55 .",
    "each @xmath26 miner belongs to a pool , and consequently at each time @xmath13 she always has a probability higher than 0 to mine at least some sub - units of bitcoin .",
    "this probability is inversely proportional to the hashing capability of the whole network . knowing the number of blocks discovered per day , and consequently knowing the number of new bitcoins @xmath56 to be mined per day , the number of bitcoins @xmath57 mined by @xmath26 miner per day can be defined as follows :    @xmath58    where :    * @xmath59 is the hashing capability of the whole population of miners @xmath60 at time @xmath13 defined as the sum of the hashing capabilities of all miners at time @xmath13 , @xmath61 ; * the ratio @xmath62 defines the relative hash rate of @xmath26 miner at time @xmath13 .",
    "note that , as already described in section _ mining process _ , the parameter @xmath56 decreases over time . at first",
    ", each generated block corresponds to the creation of 50 bitcoins , but after four years , such number is halved .",
    "so , until november 27 , 2012 , 100,800 bitcoins were mined in 14 days ( 7200 bitcoins per day ) , and then 50,400 bitcoins in 14 days ( 3600 per day ) .",
    "the decision of a miner to buy and/or divests a hardware unit @xmath36 depends on the bitcoins potentially obtained mining with the new hardware .",
    "a miner buys new hardware units if the daily cost , given by the expense in electricity , @xmath63 , associated to these units is smaller than the gain expected in bitcoin .",
    "hence , before buying new hardware units the following constraint has to be evaluated :    @xmath64    where :    * @xmath65 are the bitcoins potentially mined by unit @xmath36 at time @xmath13 : @xmath66 * @xmath67 is the bitcoin price at time @xmath13 .",
    "only if this constraint is respected the miner can buy new hardware . in this case",
    ", she issues a market order acquiring an amount of fiat cash @xmath55 in the next time steps .",
    "she invests 50% of this amount to buy new hardware and keeps the remaining 50% as cash , to pay the electricity bill for her hardware .    if the constraint in eq .",
    "[ constrainttobuy ] is not respected , the miner anyway issues a market order equal to @xmath68 to support her electricity expenses .",
    "a miner divests her old hardware units if the expense in electricity associated to that units is 20% higher than the gain expected in bitcoins using that hardware , at the current price .",
    "therefore , the following constraint has to be respected for each value of @xmath69 , with @xmath69 going from 0 to current time @xmath13 :    @xmath70    the model also includes a mechanism that enables 10% of miners to invest and/or divest their hardware also at a time @xmath71 .",
    "this mechanism is triggered when the price relative variation , in a time window @xmath72 equal to 15 days , is positive and is higher than a threshold @xmath73 equal to 0.016 .",
    "this because , in the real market , the investments of miners grow when the profitability of mining activity increases .",
    "so , increasing the interest of miners in buying new hardware in these periods is a plausible assumption .",
    "[ [ sec:4.1.2 ] ] random traders + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    _ random traders _ represent persons who enter the crypto - currency market for various reasons , but not for speculative purposes .",

    "@xmath74 is specific for each chartist , and is characterized by a normal distribution with average equal to 20 and standard deviation equal to 1 .",
    "chartists usually issue buy orders when the price is increasing and sell orders when the price is decreasing . however , 10% of chartists decide , instead , to adopt a contrary strategy , and place a sell order instead of a buy order , or vice - versa .",
    "this contrarian behavior is common in financial markets , and is typically modeled also in market models @xcite .",
    "note that a chartist will issue an order only when the price variation is above a given threshold .",
    "so , in practice , the extent of chartist activity varies over time . in general",
    "the modelled chartists behavior is key to produce large price variations , and to the reproduction of the basic statistical proprieties of the real returns .",

    "when new traders are needed to enter the simulation , they are chosen randomly in this set .",
    "as mentioned in subsection _ the agents _ , only a given percentage of traders is active in the market , and hence enabled to issue orders . to compute this percentage we made some assumptions starting from the work @xcite from which we extracted table [ transactionnumber ] , which shows the distribution of the transactions number per entity ( _ entity _ means the common owner of multiple bitcoin addresses ) and per address on a period between january 3rd , 2009 and may @xmath157 2012 .",
    "[ tab : transactionnumber ]    by analyzing table [ transactionnumber ] , we can observed that 97.37% of all entities had fewer than 10 transactions each , 2.27% of all entities had a number of transactions ranging from 10 to 100 , 0.34 % of all entities had a number of transactions ranging from 100 to 1,000 , and the remaining 0.02 % had a number of transactions higher than 1,000 .    according to the insights coming from this work , we neglected the entities having fewer than 10 transactions each and the entities having more than 1,000 transactions each .",
    "this was done hypothesizing that the formers , typically involving a small number of bitcoins , refer to entities who made transactions by chance `` only to use '' this new coin , whereas the latters , involving a very high of transactions , are probably not linked to single traders , but are the addresses of exchange sites , or of retailers accepting bitcoins .",
    "we considered the remaining entities , that is the entities with a number of transactions in the range from 10 to 1,000 .",
    "they issue orders with a period ranging from about one day to about 122 days , because these data are computed on 1227 days . as a result ,",
    "the daily trading probability of an entity ranges from 0.008 to 1 .",
    "we set the values of trading probabilities for random traders and chartists in this range .",
    "specifically , we assumed that , random traders are active with a probability @xmath158 , whereas the chartists are active with a probability @xmath159 .",
    "this because the interest of chartists in purchasing or selling bitcoins is higher than that of random traders .",
    "random traders issue orders to satisfy their needs , whereas chartists issue orders for speculative reasons , study carefully the price variation over time and are readier to place orders .",
    "note that active chartists actually place orders only if the price variation is above a given threshold .",
    "one of the most attractive property of bitcoin is to provide quasi - anonymous transactions , so knowing the number of traders in the real market is very difficult .",
    "the bitcoin addresses used for the transactions are known , but a user can have , and typically has , more than one address .    at the moment of writing ( last quarter of 2015 ) we had three figures :    1 .",
    "the massive and transparent ledger of every bitcoin transaction was generated starting since january 3 , 2009 presumably by the inventor of the bitcoin system itself , nakamoto and so in january 2009 there was only one person owning bitcoins ; 2 .   _",

    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in addition to these figures , we have other data related to the period between january 2009 and september 2010 .",
    "these data were extracted from an analysis on the daily number of downloads of the official bitcoin software client from the sourceforge platform ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin ) .    in the period just mentioned , the bitcoin network began to spread and bitcoin had no monetary value .",
    "so , for this period we assumed the number of downloads of the official bitcoin software client equal to the number of traders in the market .",
    "we made the assumption that a person who downloads the bitcoin software is mainly interested to use it to mine bitcoins .",
    "so , we extracted two figures from this data : the total number of downloads on may 1st , 2010 equal to 2,769 , and the total number of downloads on september 1st , 2010 , equal to 30,589 , and we set the number of downloads equal to the number of traders .",
    "so , we computed the number of traders in the market fitting the curve @xmath160 through the five figures available :    1 .",
    "1 people owned bitcoins on january 2009 .",
    "he was satoshi nakamoto ; 2 .",
    "2769 people had downloaded bitcoin mining software on may 2010 ; 3 .",
    "30589 people had downloaded bitcoin mining software on september 2010 ; 4 .",
    "280,000 people owned bitcoins at the end of 2013 ; 5 .",
    "1000000 people owned bitcoins on april 2014 .",
    "the fitting curve of the number of traders @xmath160 is defined by using a general exponential model :    @xmath161    where @xmath162 , @xmath163 .",
    "[ fig : tradprobbemin ] ( a ) show the fitting curve and how the number of traders increases over time .",
    "at first , users in the bitcoin network were mainly miners .",
    "subsequently , when the bitcoin network started to grow and bitcoins started to acquire a monetary value , new users entered the network .",
    "most of these users did not mine , but simply traded bitcoins .",
    "they are represented in the model as random traders and chartists .    since the percentages of the different trader populations is not known , to compute the probability of a trader to be a miner we performed an analysis of the bitcoin blockchain .",
    "we analysed the blockchain until may 1st , 2010 and then until september 1st , 2010 .",
    "each block in the blockchain contains a list of validated transactions .",
    "each transaction has in input all the addresses containing the amount of bitcoins to transfer , and in output all the addresses that receive the bitcoins .",
    "users can use multiple addresses .",
    "we assumed , as in @xcite , that the input addresses that send bitcoins to the same output address must belong to an unique owner , since to proceed with the transaction it is necessary to know the private keys of all input addresses .",
    "in addition , we considered the input addresses that transfer more than 20 bitcoins owned by the same owner of the corresponding outputs . in fact , in the period from may 1st , 2010 , to september 1st , 2010 bitcoins had no monetary value , and so it is acceptable to consider that miners exchanged only small amounts of bitcoins to test the operation of the network . of course , this last assumption can be valid only for the period under study .    with these assumptions",
    ", we found 46,005 unique addresses on may 1st , 2010 and 82,294 unique addresses on september 1st , 2010 . with further analysis , we found that on may 1st , 2010 , out of 46,005 addresses , 43,389 were addresses that mined , and on september 1st , 2010 , out of 82,294 addresses , 55,974 were addresses that mined , so we computed the probability of an user to be a miner .",
    "this probability is equal to 0.94% on may 1st , 2010 and equal to 0.68% on september 1st , 2010 .",
    "[ fig : tradprobbemin ] ( b ) shows the fitting curve and how this probability decreases over time .",
    "we see that the probability of a trader to be a miner decreases over time , going about from 0.38 to less than 0.01 . of course ,",
    "defining this probability using a fitting curve computed from only two points is questionable . in the followings",
    ", we made some considerations to validate the adoption of this curve .",
    "at first , the number of bitcoin transactions was low because in the market there were mainly miners . over time , as bitcoin was acquiring monetary value , the number of users interested in exchanging bitcoins increased .",
    "so , while the percentage of miners in the market was decreasing , also due to the increasing difficult to mine bitcoins , the percentage of random traders @xmath168 and chartists @xmath169 greatly increased , according to the growth of the number of transactions , which slowly rose until a peak on may 2012 and then at the end of the 2013 ( see figure [ fig : tradprobbemin ] ( c ) ) . .",
    "we assumed that the random traders to chartist ratio is 7/3 , meaning that 30% of traders who are not miners are speculators , whereas the remaining 70% are non - speculative investors .",
    "these figures are consistent with recent data obtained for the foreign exchange market @xcite .",
    "the probabilities of non - miners to be a random trader or a chartist , @xmath168 and @xmath169 respectively , are defined as a function of @xmath164 , respectively as :          with these probabilities , we have at the end of the simulations a number of miners equal to about 1000 , corresponding to 100,000 miners in the real world .",
