    "exoplanet research is now a rapidly maturing branch of astronomy .",
    "in particular , a number of recently discovered planets have masses of order the earth s and offer the possibility of studying other worlds much like our own .",
    "the initial analysis of the kepler mission data indicates that the small transiting planets are even more abundant than large ones @xcite which is consistent with the statistical trend for planets discovered by the radial - velocity method @xcite .",
    "moreover , candidates of nearly earth - sized exoplanets within the habitable zones of their host stars have been already claimed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless a mere detection of such a planet would be far from convincing evidence for habitability .    far richer information concerning",
    "the habitability would come from the atmospheric and surface properties of such planets , which will be probed by photometric and spectroscopic observation of planets in optical and near - ir bands .",
    "the light in the bands is dominated by starlight scattered by the planets , and the wavelength - dependent reflectivity and absorption features could provide direct indications of the planetary surface and atmospheric properties .",
    "this is why a number of on - going and future efforts including seeds @xcite , tmt ( with a future instrument for direct imaging of earth - like planets , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , o3 @xcite , see - coast @xcite , spica ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) plan to develop instruments for direct observations of exoplanets .",
    "until we have the first scattered light observation for an earth - like exoplanet , we may use the earth itself as a useful test - bed for future investigations as proposed by @xcite .",
    "one approach is to extract spatially integrated scattered light from earthshine .",
    "in addition to several clear absorption lines of biologically important molecules like h@xmath3o , o@xmath3 , o@xmath4 and ch@xmath5(e.g .",
    "* ) , a marginal signature of the red - edge due to vegetation ( sharp increase of reflectivity at wavelength longer than 0.75@xmath6 m , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been reported ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in an amount consistent with simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    another approach is based on remote - sensing observation of the earth , notably multi - band photometric data obtained with the epoxi spacecraft .",
    "@xcite performed principle component analysis ( pca ) in order to reconstruct surface features from the epoxi data .",
    "their pca inversion identified two major eigen modes , the `` red '' and the `` blue '' components , which they roughly interpreted as land and ocean , respectively .",
    "they attempted to map the red component on the planetary surface using the diurnal variation , and found that it roughly reproduces the land distribution of the earth along the longitudinal direction .",
    "we note here that their analysis neglects the effect of clouds on the diurnal light - curve since they assumed that the cloud cover fraction is constant at all time .",
    "@xcite also attempted a longitudinal mapping of land and ocean components from a single - band , instead of multi - band , simulated photometry using the difference in reflectivity between land and ocean .",
    "@xcite ( hereinafter paper i ) developed another reconstruction method of the planetary surface .",
    "in contrast to model - independent approaches such as pca , paper i approximates the planetary surface by a combination of four components : `` ocean , '' `` soil , '' `` vegetation , '' and `` snow '' .",
    "the fractional areas of the four components were fit to reproduce the simulated light - curves of multi - band photometry of the _ cloudless _ earth , and the method recovers the presence of ocean , soil and even vegetation reasonably well .",
    "the present paper extends the methodology and analysis of paper i in various respects : 1 ) we now include a `` cloud '' component both in computing simulated diurnal multi - band light - curves ( forward procedure ) and in reconstructing the fractional areas of the five components ( inverse procedure ) , 2 ) the simulated light - curves are based on the radiative transfer code _ rstar6b _ @xcite instead of employing paper i s single scattering approximation , and 3 ) the reconstruction procedure is applied to the epoxi data instead of simulated light curves .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s : epoxi ] describes the technical details of the epoxi observations on which the subsequent sections are based .",
    "section [ s : sim ] discusses our forward procedure for computing the simulated light curves using _",

    "we also consider six different combinations of assumed soil , clouds and atmosphere properties , and discuss the resulting systematic uncertainty of the reconstruction .",

    "the observational uncertainty is less than 0.1 % , which is negligible in this figure.,width=359 ]    one significant improvement over paper i of the present work is the use of direct observations of the earth s diurnal light curves , both as a validation of our forward procedure and as input for the inverse procedure .",
    "in particular we employ observations of the earth that were obtained during nasa s epoxi mission .",
    "the epoxi mission reused the deep impact spacecraft to carry out multi - band photometry of the earth in optical / near - ir @xcite .",
    "epoxi observations of the earth covered one whole day in each of march , may and june of 2008 .",
    "the may data include a lunar transit of the earth and thus introduce complexities that are beyond the scope of the present effort ; we therefore do not use the may data .",

    "the spacecraft observed the earth 76.7% illuminated at a phase angle of 57.7@xmath16 in march , near the northern spring equinox , and 61.5% illuminated at a phase angle of 76.6@xmath16 in june , near the northern summer solstice .",
    "the data effectively mimic observations of earth - twins near quadrature in exoplanetary systems because the distance between the spacecraft and the earth in march ( @xmath17 ) and in june ( @xmath18 ) is a few thousand times the earth s radius and thus represents a good approximation to the geometry of an observation from infinite range .",
    "we use photometry obtained with the deep impact hrivis instrument at one - hour intervals in each of seven bands that span the visible range : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "images obtained with the hrivis camera are processed automatically for bias - subtraction , flat - fielding , an absolute calibration @xcite .",
    "data acquired during the epoxi mission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that the pixel - by - pixel flat - fielding correction has become inaccurate by about 1% , with random distribution across the detector array .",
    "the epoxi earth observations combine signal from thousands of pixels per frame , reducing the significance of random deviations to negligibility .",
    "photometric signal is extracted from epoxi earth images by aperture photometry , summing over a circular extraction region centered on earth s disc .",
    "background signal is estimated from an annular region of similar surface area .",
    "the calibrated image units multiplied by the known solid angle per pixel yields collected intensity in units of w / m@xmath26/@xmath8 m .",
    "the intensity is corrected for changes in the range from earth to spacecraft , which varies slightly over the course of each 24-hour observing sequence and varies significantly between observations .",
    "variations in earth s heliocentric distance , while minor , are corrected similarly .",
    "measurement uncertainties in the photometry are very small , of order 0.1% @xcite , evaluated from the distribution of pixel values in the annular background used in the photometry .",
    "photometry of the moon , which did not alter its aspect during a set of epoxi measurements in may 2008 , yields an independent estimate of photometric uncertainty of about 0.05% after scaling for the relative diameter of earth and moon",
    ". actual variability of the earth s signal is a much greater source of variability in the measurements , creating a range of measurements that is approximately @xmath274 - 8% of the mean signal measured in each filter .",
    "this range of variability is defined by the limits of the central 68th - percentile of the photometric sample population , yielding `` one sigma '' confidence limits on the expected value to be determined from a single independent measurement .",
    "the complete data set and data - reduction procedures are described by @xcite .",
    "the hrivis filter functions are shown in figure [ fig : epoxifilter ] along with the ccd response function .",
    "optical components within the telescope and spectrograph further limit the extreme blue and red sensitivity of the shortest and longest wavelengths bands , respectively .    .",
    "points represent the colors of some representative earth - surface components .",
    ", width=453 ]    in figure [ fig : lc_epoxi ] , we display the epoxi data interpreted in terms of apparent albedo @xmath28 .",
    "we follow the definition of @xmath28 in @xcite , as the ratio of total scattered intensity to the intensity of the incident solar flux scattered by a lossless lambert sphere of the planet s radius , at the observed phase angle , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the scattered intensity as a function of the wavelength @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the incident flux , @xmath33 is the planetary radius , @xmath34 is the phase angle , and @xmath35 is the phase function for scattering by a lambert sphere . note that it is 3/2 times the geometric albedo .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : lc_epoxi ] displays the photometry of 7 epoxi bands averaged over both of the observed days , with the standard deviation of hourly measurements indicated as error bars .",
    "the variability in the measurements does not result from finite observational precision , but instead is the actual variability of the earth s signal .",
    "as mentioned above , the observational uncertainty of the epoxi measurements results in negligible noise level ( @xmath36 0.1% with no exposure time longer than 100 ms ) because the source ( the earth ) is extremely bright .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : lc_epoxi ] shows the diurnal variation of each color band in march ( solid ) and in june ( dashed ) ; this figure illustrates both the common patterns of and difference between the march and june data .",
    "these data are qualitatively consistent with the expected photometric variability of the earth , as first discussed by @xcite .",
    "the shape variations between the lightcurves in different filters suggest looking more closely at the systematic diurnal color variability .",
    "we define color quantitatively as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the reflectivity in band @xmath39 , following the conventional astronomical practice .",
    "we select the @xmath10 and @xmath22 bands to measure the variation in the blue region of the spectrum at short wavelengths and the @xmath12 and @xmath40 bands to quantify the variation in the red region of the spectrum at long wavelengths .",
    "figure [ fig : colorcolor_24 - 46_epoxi ] displays the resulting color - color diagram of the diurnal light curves of the earth for the two days . the colors of some representative components as seen through clear atmospheric layers are plotted as points in figure [ fig : colorcolor_24 - 46_epoxi ] for reference .    unsurprisingly , the average colors of the earth are similar to the colors of clouds , but somewhat displaced due to the surface components .",
    "our goal is to develop a methodology to reconstruct the surface properties from the diurnal scattered light curves of exoplanets in habitable zones . however , before proceeding to this inversion , we choose to gain better insights into the problem and to validate our assumptions and models by carrying out forward calculations and comparing the results to the epoxi data . in particular , we aim to determine the accuracy and limitation of the models of surfaces , clouds , and atmospheres as well as to validate our simulation code .",
    "therefore , in this section we combine the models and empirical data of the surface and the cloud distribution so as to reproduce the diurnal light curves in multi - bands observed by epoxi .",
    "in addition to the forward calculation presented in paper i , numerous other groups have simulated the scattered light of the earth @xcite .",
    "basically the computation of the light - curves of the earth requires the integration of the scattered light over the illuminated and visible surface .",
    "we have to divide the surface into two dimensional pixels and sum up the contribution from each pixel by approximating it locally as a flat plane .",
    "we use @xmath41 latitude / longitude pixels as a compromise between computation time and accuracy .    unlike paper",
    "i , which neglects multiple scattering and molecular absorptions , we incorporate both effects by using the line - by - line radiative transfer code _",
    "rstar6b_. this code has been developed intensively as a tool for interpreting the remote - sensing data of the earth .",
    "it incorporates the detailed modeling of optical properties of the atmosphere and clouds .",
    "scattering processes in the earth s atmosphere are complicated .",
    "since the albedos of clouds are generally much higher than those of the planetary surface components , the broad distribution of the cloud optical depths crucially affects the light curve of the earth .",
    "atmospheric pressure is the key parameter that determines the optical depth of rayleigh scattering as well as the atmospheric features due to molecules , and the spectral features depend sensitively on the composition of the atmosphere .",
    "both affect the broad - band photometry considered here .    for simplicity",
    "we adopt a representative set of parameters called the `` us standard '' model atmosphere , and assume that the model is valid everywhere .",
    "basically the model provides the molecular composition and the temperature - pressure relation as a function of the altitude .",
    "however , the total scattered light is not sensitive to the details of those profiles .",
    "in addition to the homogeneous `` us standard '' model atmosphere , our model includes an empirical inhomogeneous cloud distribution .",
    "the spatial distribution of clouds is characterized by the cloud cover fraction @xmath42 and the cloud optical thickness @xmath43 in each pixel .",
    "we use the cloud data set from terra / modis atmosphere level 3 product @xcite .",
    "these data are daily global maps based on modis onboard the earth observing satellite _ terra _ and are given in @xmath44 latitude / longitude pixels .",
    "thus we merge them into @xmath45 pixels to match the resolution that we use in the numerical code .",
    "the cloud data are not available for some locations , and we interpolate the data according to the procedure described in the appendix [ ap : input ] to fill these gaps .    although we take account of the spatial distribution of clouds , their optical properties are assumed to be everywhere the same .",
    "these optical properties depend on various parameters including the vertical profile , composition , phase ( liquid or solid ) , radii and shapes of particles . for simplicity , we assume that all of the clouds are located at the altitude of 3.5 - 6.5 km and are composed of pure water ; we neglect aerosols .",
    "the size distribution function of cloud particles is assumed to be @xmath46   & ( 1.0\\times 10^{-6}{\\rm cm",
    "} \\le r \\le 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}{\\rm cm } ) \\\\   0   & ( { \\rm otherwise } )   \\end{array }   \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the normalization factor .",
    "it also uses the size parameter @xmath48 cm and @xmath49 .",
    "clouds with these properties are hereinafter called `` middle clouds '' .",
    "the scattering model for the planetary surface is basically the same as adopted in paper i. however , there are small differences in our treatment of land bidirectional reflection distribution functions ( brdf ) .",
    "these are described below .",
    "the scattering properties of land are described by the rossi - li model , a parametrized brdf .",
    "while the model has three different terms ( isotropic , geometric , and volume terms ; see paper i for details ) , we now approximate the planetary surface as lambertian ( isotropic scattering surface ) , and neglect the geometric and volume terms . at the geometry of the epoxi observation , this approximation leads to @xmath36 5% differences in reflectivity compared to the light curves simulated with all three brdf terms .",
    "we also follow paper i in using the brdf coefficients from `` snow - free gap - filled modis brdf model parameters '' , which is a spatially and temporally averaged product derived from the 0.05@xmath50 resolution brdf / albedo data .",
    "therefore we again merge the data into @xmath41 pixels by simply averaging the brdf coefficients within each pixel ( from @xmath51 data points ) .",
    "the brdf for ocean pixels is described in appendix b of paper i ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the key parameter in this brdf is the wind velocity 10 m above the surface , which we set to 4 m / s everywhere .",
    "note that this model neglects the sub - surface scattering . in reality , the sub - surface scattering results in a slightly bluer ocean color than our model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "finally we take account of the snow cover on the planetary surface , neglected in paper i. the fraction of the snow - covered area is very small , but it may affect the total scattered light curve because of its high albedo . for this purpose , we use a data set of the monthly mean ice / snow cover fraction from international satellite cloud climatology project ( isccp ) .",
    "the data are provided in @xmath52 grids , and we interpolate them into @xmath41 pixels according to the nearest - grid - point assignment .",
    "we regard those pixels with snow cover fraction greater than 0.5 as snow pixels , and then assign the albedo of `` fine snow '' from aster spectral library ( shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : albedo_surface ] below ) .",

    "the statistical variations produced by signal - to - noise ratio 10 are shown as vertical solid lines .",
    ", width=453 ]            as described earlier , our inversion may depend heavily on the adopted albedos for the selected surface components",
    ". it will not be easy to evaluate such systematic uncertainties associated with the model assumptions for future studies of exoplanets . however",
    ", we may gain some insights into the problem by comparing inversions of the epoxi data using the different models listed in table [ tab : invmodel ] .",
    "figure [ fig : wiperange_ave ] is the same as the left panel of figure [ fig : bvls_june_cldml-10_soil - inceptisol_ave ] but for models i to vi . now the symbols indicate the estimates returned by the different models , and the vertical dashed lines indicate the range of model - to - model variations .",
    "most of the model dependence can be qualitatively understood .",
    "model ii ( cross ) , in which soil b is assumed instead of soil a , overestimates the area for soil because the effective albedo of soil b shows a lower - amplitude red portion of its spectrum ( fig [ fig : albedo_surface ] ) .",
    "models iii ( asterisk ) and iv ( open square ) assume different altitudes for cloud layer .",
    "the difference in cloud altitude changes the absorption depths ( fig [ fig : effalbd_cld ] ) , and therefore the estimated areas of all the components are affected accordingly . if we adopt model v ( plus ) with @xmath53 clouds , which have a reflectivity smaller than those with @xmath54 , we end up with a larger estimate of the cloud area . again , the estimation of all of the surface components is also affected by this change .",
    "model vi ( open circle ) assumes no ozone in the atmosphere , and the lack of ozone s broad absorption at @xmath55 decreases the slope of all albedo models at short wavelengths . as a result",
    ", the area of ocean is estimated to be larger to compensate it .    for reference we also plot the model i result with s / n=10 in figure [ fig : wiperange_ave ] .",
    "the corresponding error bars for the fractional area are similar to the variation among different models considered here .",
    "this implies that the model - dependent systematic errors are not dominant for an observational s / n of order 10 .",
    "this conclusion is also consistent with the result for the diurnal light curves shown in figure [ fig : wiperange ] .",
    "the shaded region in each panel of this figure indicates the range of the estimates among different models .",
    "again the basic features are similar to those shown in figure [ fig : bvls_june_cldml-10_soil - inceptisol ] ; while the amplitudes of the estimated area vary fairly significantly from model to model , the overall variation patterns are relatively stable .",
    "two of the minor surface components , `` soil '' and `` snow '' , are difficult to identify robustly , but the major components , `` cloud '' and `` ocean '' , are detectable in all the models .",
    "finally the presence of `` vegetation '' may be detectable at some phases without being confused with the other components , probably due to its conspicuous `` red edge '' feature .     of different models as a function of time .",
    "the curve labeled `` reference '' assumes ocean , soil a and middle clouds of optical thickness 10 but no vegetation component .",
    "the curve labeled `` ref@xmath56clouds '' means that the model omits clouds but otherwise is identical to the reference model , and the other labels are to be understood in the same manner .",
    ", width=377 ]    so far we have shown that our inversion procedure can identify ocean and clouds reasonably well but that the other components are not securely identified .",
    "nevertheless , we may ask if an additional , unknown surface component is required to achieve a satisfactory fit . this is a retreat in a sense but",
    "may be a less model - dependent approach .    for this purpose ,",
    "we compute and compare the goodness - of - fit to the observed data with and without specific surface types .",
    "figure [ fig : barchi ] shows @xmath57 per square - root of the degree - of - freedom for various models ( without vegetation for simplicity ) .",
    "the reference model plotted in black solid line assumes that the planetary surface comprises of clouds , ocean and soil a. the other curves correspond to the four variants of the reference model : models with clouds , ocean and soil b instead of soil a ( dot - dashed ) , with cloud and soil a without ocean ( dotted ) , with ocean and soil a without clouds ( long - dotted ) , and with clouds and ocean without soil ( short - dotted ) .",
    "the resulting residuals of @xmath58 may be roughly interpreted as the inverse of the signal - to - noise ratio required to detect the discrepancy between the model and the observation . since figure [ fig : barchi ] indicates that models with both ocean and clouds have values as low as 0.01 , the presence of an additional component would be revealed by the data only with s / n @xmath2 100 . on the other hand ,",
    "models without either clouds or ocean show the difference in @xmath58 values of 0.020.03 at certain phases of the light curves .",
    "it provides a rough idea of the signal - to - noise ratio ( or the amount of the exposure time ) required to identify such surface components in future exoplanet observations .",
    "incidentally it is interesting to note that the time variation pattern of @xmath58 essentially follows that of the _ missing _ component ; for instance , the model without ocean shows the largest discrepancy at @xmath59 when almost all of the illuminated and visible area is covered by ocean ( fig.[fig : snapshot ] ) .",
    "our primary goal in developing an improved treatment of forward and inverse procedures is to allow us to examine the effects of clouds .",
    "the presence of clouds affects the recoverable fractional areas of the different surface components in at least three ways : blocking the direct reflection spectra from the underlying surface areas , the nonlinear modification of the underlying surface reflection spectra by semi - transparent clouds , and the additional and strong time variability they introduce .",
    "we examine these three effects in turn below .",
    "approximately half of the surface of the earth is covered by clouds with @xmath60 . to the extent that the corresponding regions are completely unseen",
    ", the total surface area that one can directly observe is reduced by the same amount .",
    "moreover the relative fractions of surface components contributing the light curves are modified because ocean and vegetation surfaces are more likely to be cloud - covered than soil ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ".        this effect of clouds may be evaluated more quantitatively with the forward calculation . to be specific ,",
    "we consider hypothetical earth - twins with different cloud cover fractions ; cloudless , reduced cloudiness , and realistic cloudiness cases .",
    "the realistic cloud case is based on the modis cloud data as described in section [ s : sim ] , while the reduced cloudiness case has roughly 50 % of the cloud cover fraction .",
    "the latter is created by multiplying both the observed cloud cover fraction and cloud optical thickness at each pixel by a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1 .",
    "the cloudless case neglects clouds entirely .",
    "the resultant color - color plot for @xmath61 and @xmath62 versus @xmath63 and @xmath61 is shown in figure [ fig : colorcolor_24 - 46 ] .",
    "the color trajectories over a diurnal period of the earth are shown by the three curves . for reference ,",
    "the colors of hypothetical planets with uniform surfaces of ocean ( plus ) , soil a ( open square ) , soil b ( painted square ) , vegetation ( asterisk ) , and snow ( cross ) with the us standard atmosphere are plotted as points .",
    "this figure indicates clearly why clouds dramatically limit our ability to recover the surface components from light curves . as the cloud cover fraction increases , the overall color approaches that of the clouds , and the amplitude of color variations is significantly reduced .",
    "the qualitative behavior is similar for color - color plots in other bands .",
    "it is , however , encouraging that the clouds do not much change the overall shape of the trajectory in color - color space .",
    "this implies that the recovery of surface components is still possible given sufficient photometric precision .",
    "our inverse procedure assumes that the observed total albedo spectrum of the earth can be approximated by a linear combination of five distinct spectra corresponding to clouds and the four surface components . in reality , the reflection spectrum of a particular surface component covered by clouds is not necessarily composed of a sum of the clouds and the surface spectra .    in order to show the difference more quantitatively , we use _",
    "rstar6b _ to compute the reflectivity of vegetation entirely covered by clouds of @xmath64 .",
    "as plotted in the left panel of figure [ fig : cldml-10+grass ] , the resulting spectrum is best - fit by a sum of clouds , vegetation and soil with fractional areas of 0.888 , 0.279 and 0.135 , respectively .",
    "the cloud - diluted red - edge feature of the vegetation is partially misidentified as soil in this case .",
    "the estimated total area exceeds unity so as to compensate for the lower reflectivities of vegetation and soil compared to clouds .",
    "we repeat the exercise for vegetation covered by clouds of @xmath65 ; the result is plotted in the right panel of figure [ fig : cldml-10+grass ] . in this case , the spectrum is decomposed as a sum of clouds , vegetation and ocean .",
    "these misidentifications are the result of our simplified treatment of the template surface albedos assumed in the inverse procedure . in reality , the wide range of cloud properties results in a variety of cloud spectra ( fig . [",
    "fig : effalbd_cld ] ) that are partially degenerate with the spectra of the other surface components . in principle , this issue could be addressed with a more elaborate and realistic model , but doing so is not justified without quite high signal - to - noise ratio observations .     case .",

    ", width=302 ]      if an exoplanet is an oblique rotator like the earth , the overall color of its surface may exhibit seasonal variations including those due to autumn leaves and snow cover . otherwise its surface components are taken to be independent of time .",
    "clouds can introduce light - curve fluctuations due to their spatial and temporal variations , but the good agreement of the diurnal epoxi light curves and our forward simulations based on a static cloud map ( see section [ s : sim ] ) indicates that the variability due to clouds is not important on a 24 hour time scale , as discussed in e.g. @xcite .",
    "since we may have to stack the data of exoplanets over a period of a few weeks or more to improve the photon statistics , the cloud variations on those longer time scales may well be more important @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we may hope that the decomposition of the stacked light curves will simply provide us an average measure of each component because the light curves are essentially linear combinations of the observing days .",
    "in turn , the time variability among the light curves folded according to the diurnal period may act as a useful probe of cloud pattern and thus weather on an exoplanet .",
    "@xcite found that the apparent rotation period is shifted by the net movement of cloud distribution .",
    "also it might be possible to use the time variability to separate the contributions from clouds and those from surface components by e.g. looking for the day with the lowest reflectivity because it is likely to correspond to the least cloudy day ; generally surface components have lower reflectivity than clouds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : albedo_surface ] ) .",
    "we have presented a methodology to interpret future photometric data of earth - like exoplanets .",
    "the methodology is an improvement over the one presented in paper i in various ways .",
    "in particular we have incorporated the presence of clouds , utilized the radiative transfer code _",
    "rstar6b _ for the atmosphere and based the reconstruction on a more diverse set of template albedo spectra .",
    "in addition , we have validated the forward procedure using the epoxi observations of the earth s light curves as well as using them as an input for the inverse procedure .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized below .    1 .",
    "our forward procedure reproduces the epoxi light curves well using the spatial distribution of the cloud cover fraction and optical depth on each observing day .",
    "this scheme will be useful to predict the light curves of earth - like exoplanets , potentially detectable with future ground - based and space facilities .",
    "2 .   while our inverse procedure is approximate and model - dependent , the presence of ocean and clouds is routinely detectable from the diurnal light curves of an earth - twin with s / n@xmath2 10 .",
    "however , s / n @xmath2 20 is required for a high confidence detection .",
    "3 .   for the necessarily limited suite of models considered in section [ ss : modeldepend ] ,",
    "the systematic uncertainties associated with the assumptions and input template spectra are similar in amplitude to the statistical errors at s / n@xmath6710 .",
    "thus , systematic uncertainties are not necessarily dominant for the signal - to - noise levels realistically expected for early exoplanet light - curve data .",
    "however , it is obviously possible for a terrestrial planet to have important surface components without counterparts on the earth ; if so , very serious systematic errors could ensue .",
    "an earth - twin exoplanet , s / n @xmath68 may enable us to detect the presence of components other than ocean and clouds in a fairly model - independent fashion .    as discussed in section [ s : dis ] , cloud cover adds complexity and uncertainty to the interpretation of planetary light curves .",
    "fortunately , clouds have their unique features such as the grey reflection spectra , time variability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the effect on thermal emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the anisotropic nature of scattering ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and polarization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in future work",
    ", it would be desirable to develop techniques for removal of clouds by making use of these characteristics in order to extract uncontaminated information on the surface .",
    "our identification of surface components depends on the differences in their reflection spectra .",
    "for example , the presence of ocean is identified as a `` dark '' components in our inversion procedure .",
    "although there might be other `` dark '' components than ocean , this approach will provide a useful check for the presence of oceans in combination with other indicators , such as `` ocean glint '' @xcite or polarimetry @xcite .    in this paper as well as paper i ,",
    "we have focused on the case of an earth - twin , but in order to further investigate the potential of photometric light curves for the characterization of terrestrial exoplanets , it will be necessary to consider models of planets unlike the earth in various aspects .",
    "we plan to investigate such models in future work .",
    "we thank atsushi taruya for useful discussion and comments , giovanna tinetti for providing the reflection spectra shown in figure 7 as a reference , and nicolas b. cowan for his advice concerning the epoxi data processing .",
    "we are grateful to openclastr project for providing the _ rstar6b _ package .",

    "the modis global cloud data available online require pre - processing to deal with two of their limitations : pixels with invalid cloud cover fraction data and those with invalid cloud optical thickness data .",

( 2 ) the sun illuminates regions near the poles at too low angle of incidence to allow measurements of cloud optical thickness ; these pixels are assigned values via the same iterative averaging of adjacent pixels used for cloud cover fraction ( see above ) .",
