    "it has been noticed that one of the complicated problems of the nonequilibrium theory of transport processes in dense gases and liquids is the fact that their kinetics and hydrodynamics are intimately coupled , and must be treated simultaneously ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) . on this",
    "we may say that microscopic descriptions of hydrodynamics , that is , associated to a derivation of kinetic equations from classical or quantum mechanics and containing kinetic ( transport ) coefficients written in terms of correlation functions , is a long standing traditional problem .",
    "an important aspect is the derivation of constitutive laws which express thermodynamic fluxes ( or currents , as those of matter and energy ) in terms of appropriate thermodynamic forces ( typically gradients of densities as those of matter and energy ) . in their most general form these laws",
    "are nonlocal in space and non - instantaneous in time .",
    "a first kinetic - hydrodynamic approach can be considered to be the so - called _ classical ( or onsagerian ) hydrodynamics _ ; it gives foundations to , for example , the classical fourier 's and fick 's diffusion laws .",
    "but it works under quite restrictive conditions , namely , local equilibrium ; linear relations between fluxes and thermodynamic forces ( meaning weak amplitudes in the motion )  with onsager 's symmetry laws holding ; near homogeneous and static movement ( meaning that the motion can be well described with basically fourier components with long wavelengths and low frequencies , and then involves only smooth variation in space and time ) ; weak and rapidly regressing fluctuations @xcite-@xcite .    hence , more advanced approaches are required to lift these restrictions .",
    "consider first near homogeneity , which implies validity in the limit of long wavelengths ( or wavenumber @xmath0 approaching zero ) . to go beyond it",
    "is necessary to introduce a proper dependence on @xmath0 valid , in principle , for intermediate and short wavelengths ( intermediate to large wavenumbers ) . in phenomenological theories",
    "this corresponds to go from classical irreversible thermodynamics to extended irreversible thermodynamics @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is what has been called _ generalized hydrodynamics _ , a question extensively debated for decades by the statistical mechanics community .",
    "several approaches have been used , and a description can be consulted in chapter 6 of the classical book on the subject by boon and yip @xcite .",
    "introduction of nonlocal effects for describing motions with influence of ever decreasing wavelengths , going towards the very short limit , has been done in terms of expansions in increasing powers of the wavenumber , which consists in what is sometimes referred to as _ higher - order hydrodynamics _ ( hoh ) .",
    "attempts to perform such expansions are the so - called burnett and super - burnett approaches in the case of mass motion , and guyer - krumhansl approach in the case of propagation of energy ( see for example refs . [",
    "11 ] and [ 12 ] ) .",
    "an usual approach has been based on the moments solution procedure of boltzmann equation , as in the work of hess @xcite , using a higher - order chapman - enskog solution method .",
    "the chapman - enskog method provides a solution to boltzmann equation consisting of a series in powers of the knudsen number , @xmath1 , given by the ratio between the mean - free path of the particles and the scale of change ( relevant wavelengths in the motion ) of the hydrodynamic fields . retaining the term linear in @xmath1",
    "there follows navier - stokes equation , the term in @xmath2 introduces burnett - like contributions , and the higher - order ones ( @xmath3 and up ) the super - burnett contributions .",
    "a satisfactory development of a hoh being also nonlinear and including fluctuations is highly desirable for covering a large class of hydrodynamic situations , and , besides its own scientific interest , also for obtaining insights into present day technological - industrial processes .",
    "also , we can mention its fundamental relevance in oceanography and meteorology ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , and that it has been stated @xcite that the idea of promoting hydraulics by statistical inference is appealing because the complete information about phenomena in hydraulics seldom exists ; for example sediment transport and the more fundamental problem in fluid mechanics of describing the velocity distribution in fluids under flow @xcite-@xcite .",
    "indeed , the nonlocal terms become specially important in miniaturized devices at submicronic lengths @xcite , or in the design of stratospheric planes , which fly in rarefied gases in a density regime between the independent particle description and the purely continuous description .",
    "another particular problem to it related is the one of obtaining the structures of shock waves in fluids for wide ranges of mach numbers @xcite .",
    "moreover , burnett approximation of hydrodynamics has been shown to provide substantial improvement on many features of the flow occurring in several problems in hydrodynamics , e.g. the case of poiseuille flow @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "the microscopic derivation of a hoh , together with the analysis of the validity of existing theories , is still a point in question .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for the case of maxwellian molecules , whereas navier - stokes approximation yields equations which are stable against small perturbations , this is not the case when are introduced burnett contributions to the equations .",
    "it follows that small perturbations to the solutions , which are periodic in the space variable with a wavelength smaller than a critical length , are exponentially unstable .",
    "this fact has been called _",
    "bobylev s instability_. moreover , karlin @xcite reconsidered the question looking for exact solutions to simplified models : when a linearized ten - moments grad method is used , and the chapman - enskog method is applied to the model , does in fact there follow instabilities in the higher - order approximations . on the other hand ,",
    "resorting to the chapman - enskog solution for linearized grad ten - moment equations resummed exactly , solutions are obtained for which the stability of higher - order hydrodynamics , in various approximations , can be discussed . however , more recently , garcia - colin and collaborators @xcite have extended bobylev s analysis for the case of any interaction potential , and have demonstrated that one can interpret the fact as to give a bound for a knudsen number above which the burnett equations are not valid , with no instability involved .",
    "furthermore , inclusion of nonlinearity in the theory , in a mesoscopic hydro - thermodynamics ( mht for short and meaning thermal physics of fluid continua ) , leads to additional possible singularities , called hydrodynamic singularities , as , for example , those described in refs .",
    "a satisfactory construction of a mht is highly desirable for covering a large class of hydrodynamic situations obtaining an understanding of the physics involved from the microscopic level , and in the last instance gaining insights into technological and industrial processes as in , for instance , hydraulic engineering , food engineering , soft - matter engineering , oil production and petrochemistry , etc . , which have an associated economic interest .",
    "mht was initiated by the so - called catalan school of thermodynamics as a large expansion of extended irreversible thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "it can be noticed that nowadays two approaches appear to be the most favorable for providing very satisfactory methods to deal with hydrodynamics within an ample scope of nonequilibrium conditions .",
    "they are nonequilibrium  molecular dynamics ( nmd ) @xcite and the kinetic theory based on the far reaching generalization of gibbs ensemble formalism , namely the nonequilibrium statistical ensemble formalism ( nesef for short ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "nmd is a computational method created for modeling physical system at the microscopic level , being a good technique to study the molecular behavior of several physical processes .",
    "together with the so - called monte carlo method are part of what is known as numeric simulation methods @xcite .",
    "we do here present an extensive derivation of a mht on the basis of the kinetic theory founded on nesef , quite appropriate to deal with systems in far - from - equilibrium conditions involving the development of ultrafast relaxation processes , and displaying nonlinear behavior leading , eventually , to instabilities and synergetic self - organization @xcite-@xcite . within the framework of nesef , but in a different approach to the one used here , an alternative mht was introduced by zubarev and tishchenko @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it may be noticed that the formalism can be extended to deal with the so - called non - conventional hydrodynamics which is associated to disordered media @xcite , consisting in systems showing a complex structure of a fractal - like ( self - affine in average ) characteristics , whose range of applicability and of physical interest is large @xcite .",
    "fall on this problem the case of the distinctive behavior of polyatomic structures such as colloidal particles , surfactant micelles , and polymer and biopolymer ( as dna ) in liquid solutions , which are classical examples of what is presently referred to as soft condensed matter @xcite .",
    "one particular case of apparently unusual behavior is the one associated to hydrodynamic motion leading to a so - called non - fickian diffusion , described by a time evolution following a kind of fractional - power law @xcite .",
    "the nonequilibrium statistical thermo - mechanical aspects of complex systems including illustrations is reported elsewhere @xcite ; a case involving hydro - thermodynamics is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper the conventional nesef - based mht",
    "is described in next section , accompanied with the study of a system consisting of particles embedded in a fluid which acts as a thermal bath at rest and in thermal equilibrium with an external reservoir . the general theory for the mht",
    "is built upon a generalization of grad s moments method for solution of , in this case , a generalized kinetic equation derived in the context of nesef @xcite .",
    "for building a nonlinear higher - order ( generalized ) hydro - thermodynamics on mechanical statistical basis , one needs to resort to a nonequilibrium statistical ensemble formalism ( nesef ) for open systems .",
    "such formalism was developed step by step along the past century by a number of renowned scientists whose contributions have been systematized and generalized in a close structure , as described in refs .",
    "@xcite to @xcite .",
    "according to theory , immediately after the open system of @xmath4 particles , in contact with external sources and reservoirs , has been driven out of equilibrium , the description of its state requires to introduce all its observables , their fluctuations and , eventually , higher - order variances . in most cases it suffices to take a reduced set of observables , what implies in to have access to the so - called one - particle ( or single - particle ) , @xmath5 , and two - particle , @xmath6 , dynamical operators for any subset of the particles involved",
    "this is so because all observable quantities can be expressed at the microscopic mechanical level in terms of these operators ( e.g. refs . @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "on the basis of the construction of the nonequilibrium statistical operator @xcite-@xcite , and taking into account the noted above fact that a complete description of the nonequilibrium state of the system follows from the knowledge of the single- and two - particle density operators ( or equivalently the associated reduced density matrices ) which in classical mechanics are @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the coordinate and momentum of the j - th particle , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 are called field variables , the most complete nonequilibrium statistical distribution @xcite , @xcite-@xcite is the one built in terms of the auxiliary statistical operator @xmath14 where @xmath15 refers to the system of @xmath4 particles of mass @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the one associated to a thermal bath of @xmath18 particles of mass @xmath19 taken in equilibrium at temperature @xmath20 .",
    "the first one is given by @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23@xmath24 hence , @xmath25 depends on the variables of the system of interest and @xmath17 on the variables of the thermal bath ; both distributions are taken as normalized , as it should , with @xmath26 ensuring the normalization of @xmath15 , that is , @xmath27@xmath22@xmath23@xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the nonequilibrium thermodynamic variables conjugated to @xmath31 and @xmath6 meaning that @xmath32@xmath33 where ln@xmath34 with @xmath35 playing the role of a nonequilibrium partition function and @xmath36 stands for functional derivative , in complete analogy with the equilibrium case .",
    "moreover , @xmath37 is the element of volume in the phase space of the system , and for simplicity we have omitted to indicate the dependence on @xmath38 of @xmath31 , @xmath6 , @xmath15 , @xmath39 , and that @xmath17 depends on the phase point @xmath40 in the phase space of the bath .",
    "we stress that @xmath15 of eq.([eq4 ] ) is not the statistical operator of the nonequilibrium system , but an auxiliary one  called the  instantaneously frozen quasi - equilibrium  statistical operator  that allows to built the proper nonequilibrium statistical operator , which needs to include _",
    "historicity and irreversibility _ not present in @xmath15 , hence it does not account for dissipative processes , and besides does not provide correct average values in the calculation of transport coefficients and response functions .",
    "we recall that the nonequilibrium statistical operator is given by @xcite , @xcite-@xcite @xmath41 with @xmath25 of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , and where@xmath42 is the auxiliary operator carrying on the mechanical evolution of the system under hamiltonian @xmath43 ( @xmath44 is the liouvillian operator of the system meaning @xmath45 ) .",
    "usually the system s hamiltonian is separated out into two terms , namely , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the kinetic energy operator and @xmath48 contains the internal interactions energy operator @xmath49 , while @xmath50 accounts for the interaction of the system with the thermal bath , and @xmath51 is the energy operator associated to the coupling of the system with external pumping sources .",
    "finally , @xmath52 is an infinitesimal positive real number which is taken going to zero after the traces in the calculation of averages have been performed ( it is present in a kernel that introduces irreversibility in the calculations , in a krylov - bogoliubov sense @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "we stress that the second contribution in the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ eq811 ] ) accounts for historicity and irreversible evolution from the initial time ( taken in the remote past , @xmath53 , implying in adiabatic coupling of correlations , ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or alternatively , can be seen as the adiabatic coupling of the interactions responsible for relaxation processes @xcite ) .",
    "moreover we notice that the time derivative in eq .",
    "( [ eq811 ] ) takes care of the change in time of the thermodynamic state of the system ( the first term in the argument i.e. @xmath54 ) and of the microscopic mechanical evolution ( second term in the argument , i.e. @xmath55 , see eq .",

    "the trace operation @xmath60 is in this classical approach to be understood as an integration over phase space ; @xmath31 and @xmath6 are functions on phase space and @xmath61 and @xmath59 functionals of these two .",

    "a knowledge of some moments is not sufficient to determine the distribution completely ; it implies in only possessing partial knowledge of the characteristics of this distribution @xcite .",
