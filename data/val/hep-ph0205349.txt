    "the explanation of the cosmological baryon asymmetry is a challenge for particle physics . in principle",
    ", already the standard model contains all necessary ingredients , baryon number violation , @xmath9 and @xmath1 violation , and also the required departure from thermal equilibrium could be generated during the electroweak phase transition @xcite .",
    "however , due to the lower bound on the higgs boson mass from lep , electroweak baryogenesis is no longer a viable mechanism , except for some supersymmetric extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "a simple and elegant explanation of the observed baryon asymmetry is offered by neutrino physics . during the past years data on atmospheric and solar neutrinos have provided strong evidence for neutrino masses and mixings . in the seesaw mechanism",
    "@xcite the smallness of these neutrino masses is naturally explained by the mixing of the left - handed neutrinos with heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "further , the connection between baryon and lepton number in the high - temperature , symmetric phase of the standard model due to rapid sphaleron transitions @xcite is by now firmly established @xcite . as in classical gut baryogenesis",
    "@xcite , out - of - equilibrium decays of the heavy majorana neutrinos can then generate a lepton asymmetry which , by sphaleron processes , is partially transformed into a baryon asymmetry @xcite .    a beautiful aspect of this ` leptogenesis ' mechanism is the connection between the cosmological baryon asymmetry and neutrino properties .",
    "this connection is established by standard kinetic calculations @xcite , very much like in big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite , where light nuclei play the role analogous to leptons in leptogenesis .",
    "the requirement of ` successful baryogenesis ' , i.e. the existence of neutrino masses and mixings for which the predicted and the observed value of the baryon asymmetry are in agreement , constitutes a severe test for models of neutrino masses , which has been extensively explored during the past years @xcite .    on the experimental side ,",
    "the precision of measurements of the baryon asymmetry has significantly improved with the observation of the acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .",
    "the boomerang and dasi experiments have measured the baryon asymmetry with a ( 1@xmath10 ) standard error of @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 since the number of relic photons per comoving volume is very unlikely to have changed after recombination , this is easily translated into a measurement of the quantity @xmath13 at the present time , @xmath14 in the near future the map experiment will provide results of the first full sub - degree sky survey of temperature anisotropies @xcite . the expected ( 1@xmath10 ) standard error on @xmath15 is @xmath16 , using only cmb data , no polarization measurement and even allowing for the presence of gravity wave perturbations @xcite .",
    "the planck satellite , whose launch is planned for 2007 @xcite , should reduce this error to @xmath17 . if the polarization will be measured , and if it will be possible to add extra cmb information on other cosmological parameters , then the error may become even less than @xmath18 @xcite .    in the following",
    "we shall calculate the baryon asymmetry by solving the boltzmann equations given in @xcite , assuming that the dominant contribution is given by decays of @xmath0 , the lightest of the heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "this assumption is well justified in the case of a mass hierarchy among the heavy neutrinos , i.e. @xmath19 , and it is also known to be a good approximation , if @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath21 requires a special treatment . for some flavour structures of the neutrino mass matrices it is also conceivable that the decays of the heavier neutrinos @xmath22 or @xmath23 are the main source of the baryon asymmetry @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we shall assume that quantum corrections @xcite to the boltzmann equations are small .",
    "so far , no detailed quantitative study of this important question has been carried out .",
    "as we shall see , within this framework one is left with only four parameters : @xmath3 , the cp asymmetry @xmath2 , the effective neutrino mass @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the quadratic mean of the light neutrino masses . for each set of values of these four parameters",
    "the boltzmann equations yield a prediction for the baryon asymmetry .",
    "a comparison with the observed value then defines an allowed region in the space of neutrino parameters .",
    "in addition to the neutrino parameters , there are also three quantities which characterize the initial conditions : the initial temperature , the initial abundance of heavy neutrinos and , of course , the initial baryon asymmetry . a detailed study of the stability of the final baryon asymmetry under variations of these initial conditions will be presented elsewhere @xcite . in the following",
    "we shall illustrate this dependence by presenting all results for two different choices of the initial @xmath0 abundance , namely zero and thermal initial abundance .",
    "all values in - between can be estimated by interpolation between these two cases .",
    "one can also easily extrapolate the results to initial @xmath0 abundances higher than the thermal one .",
    "fortunately , for the most interesting range of @xmath4 the dependence on the initial @xmath0 abundance turns out to be very small .",
    "clearly , a theory of the very early universe , like inflation , is needed to calculate the initial conditions for baryogenesis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we recall the boltzmann equations which we then solve numerically .",
    "we also briefly discuss some approximations underlying these equations .",
    "section  3 deals with the theoretically allowed range of the neutrino parameters , in particular the upper bound on the @xmath1 asymmetry . in section  4",
    "we present our numerical results for the baryon asymmetry and discuss the dependence on the neutrino parameters and on the choice of the initial condition .",
    "we then investigate the constraints imposed by the cmb result on the neutrino parameters .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  5 .",
    "the dynamical generation of a baryon asymmetry requires that the particle interactions do not conserve baryon number , @xmath9 and @xmath1 . in leptogenesis these conditions are realized by the couplings of the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath24 .",
    "their decays can generate an asymmetry in the number of leptons and antileptons , and therefore in @xmath25 . the crucial departure from thermal equilibrium is provided by the expansion of the universe . at temperatures @xmath26 the abundance of heavy neutrinos exceeds the thermal abundance due to their weak interactions with the thermal bath .",
    "a quantitative description of this non - equilibrium process is obtained by means of kinetic equations .",
    "the relevant processes in the thermal plasma are :    * @xmath0 decays ( @xmath27 ) and inverse - decays ( @xmath28 ) into leptons and higgs bosons , @xmath29 , and into antileptons and anti - higgs bosons , @xmath30 ; * @xmath31 scatterings mediated by the exchange of all heavy majorana neutrinos , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , and @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) ; * @xmath37 scatterings , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) ;    in brackets we have indicated how the rates of these processes are labeled in the following . in principle , one could also have additional processes , in particular those which contribute to bring the heavy neutrinos initially into thermal equilibrium @xcite . in the present ,",
    "minimal framework we neglect such interactions .",
    "since we are assuming that @xmath0 decays are the origin of lepton and baryon asymmetries , the natural temperature scale is given by the mass @xmath3 .",
    "it is therefore convenient to measure temperature in units of @xmath3 and to introduce the dimensionless variable @xmath42 . for realistic values",
    "@xmath43 , all standard model particles can be treated as massless , and we shall assume that they are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the time evolution of a charge density or a number density @xmath44 depends on the microphysical processes in the thermal plasma as well as the expansion of the universe . for the discussion of leptogenesis it is convenient to consider instead of the number density",
    "@xmath44 the particle number @xmath45 in some portion of comoving volume , which takes the effect of the expansion automatically into account .",
    "we choose the comoving volume @xmath46 which contains one photon at time @xmath47 before the onset of leptogenesis , @xmath48 with @xmath49 and therefore @xmath50 . for a boson with @xmath51 degrees of freedom one has @xmath52 , whereas for a fermion with @xmath53 degrees of freedom @xmath54 .",
    "alternatively , one may normalize the number density to the entropy density @xmath55 and consider @xmath56 , as frequently done in the literature . if entropy is conserved , both normalizations are related by a constant . however , an inconvenient aspect of the quantity @xmath57 is its dependence on the entropy degrees of freedom , @xmath58 , and on possible entropy production between @xmath47 and @xmath59 .",
    "the final baryon asymmetry is conveniently expressed in terms of the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath60 , to be compared with the cmb measurement ( [ obs ] ) .",
    "the predicted value of @xmath61 is obtained from @xmath62 by accounting for the dilution factor @xmath63 , @xmath64 in the simple case of constant entropy one has @xmath65 , with @xmath66 .",
    "assuming at @xmath47 the standard model degrees of freedom with a single majorana neutrino in addition , one obtains @xmath67 , and therefore @xmath68 .    in the decays of the heavy majorana neutrinos",
    "an asymmetry in the number of lepton doublets , and therefore in @xmath25 , is generated . in the following",
    "we shall sum over the three lepton numbers @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "because of the large neutrino mixings suggested by the solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies , we expect this to be a good approximation .",
    "a refined analysis can be performed along the lines discussed in ref .",
    "a related problem is the role of ` spectator processes ' @xcite which change the naive sphaleron baryon - to - lepton conversion rate by a factor @xmath72 , since any generated asymmetry in lepton doublets is fast distributed among many leptonic and baryonic degrees of freedom in the plasma . in the following",
    "we shall ignore this uncertainty and use the naive sphaleron conversion factor for @xmath73 , which in the standard model with one higgs doublet is @xmath74 @xcite .",

    "5a ; the fit is optimal for @xmath271 .    in case of thermal initial @xmath0 abundance the maximal efficiency factor",
    "is obtained in the unphysical limit @xmath272 , where the heavy neutrinos decouple completely from the thermal bath .",
    "one then has @xmath273 on the other hand , for sufficiently strong coupling of the heavy neutrinos to the thermal bath , i.e. @xmath274 , there is no dependence on the initial neutrino abundance , and the two cases @xmath275 and @xmath249 give the same final baryon asymmetry . in this case",
    "possible asymmetries generated in the decays of the heavier neutrinos @xmath22 and @xmath23 have also no effect on the final baryon asymmetry .",

    "( [ lg1]),([lg2 ] ) ) on the @xmath0 abundance .",
    "this is why the curves never become exactly horizontal .",
    "note , that the curves tend to converge in such a way that a small variation of @xmath3 leads to a large variation of the final asymmetry . in this region",
    "any small change in the kinetic equations can have large effects on the final asymmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "a curve corresponding to a given value of the final asymmetry , e.g. @xmath279 , is rather insensitive to small changes of the kinetic equations .",
    "thus in this region the uncertainty of @xmath142 at small values of @xmath129 is , fortunately , not important .",

    "the allowed regions are closed domains ; for @xmath249 there is no lower limit on @xmath4 .",
    "as discussed in section  3 , the effective neutrino mass @xmath4 is bounded from below by @xmath310 , the mass of the lightest neutrino , and also likely to be smaller than @xmath311 , the mass of the heaviest neutrino . for quasi - degenerate neutrinos",

    "there is a lower bound on @xmath3 as function of @xmath4 , which can be read off from fig .",

    "we have studied in some detail the minimal version of thermal leptogenesis . in this framework",
    "the decays of @xmath0 , the lightest of the heavy majorana neutrinos , are the source of the baryon asymmetry , and only yukawa interactions generate the initial heavy neutrino abundance ; further , the connection between light and heavy neutrinos is given by the seesaw mechanism .",

    "the constraint from the cosmic microwave background on the baryon asymmetry strongly restricts the allowed range of neutrino parameters . for small values of @xmath3 , the efficiency factor @xmath222 depends only on @xmath4 . together with the upper bound on the @xmath1 asymmetry , this yields an important lower bound on @xmath3 and therefore on the baryogenesis temperature , @xmath323  gev .    for large values of @xmath3 , washout effects , proportional to @xmath147 ,",
