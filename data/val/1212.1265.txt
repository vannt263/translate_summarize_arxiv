    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite is considered to be a promising candidate for quantum theory of gravity .",
    "it provides mathematically rigorous foundation for quantum gravity and has led to several significant results about the quantum structure of space and time . while its kinematics is well understood , many open issues remain unsettled , mainly in regard to the dynamics and the semiclassical limit . in spite of difficulties in the full theory of lqg",
    ", the loop approach has been successfully applied for symmetry - reduced minisuperspaces in the context of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) .",
    "lqc has yielded valuable insight into the full theory as many issues are better understood in lqc thanks to its formal simplicity . in recent years",
    ", lqc has undergone lively progress and become an active area of research @xcite .",
    "markedly , it has been shown that , for a variety of models of lqc , the cosmological singularity ( big bang , big crunch , big rip @xcite , etc . )",
    "is resolved and replaced by the big bounce , therefore affirming the long - held conviction that singularities in general relativity signal a breakdown of the classical theory and should be resolved by the quantum effects of gravity .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the black hole singularity is resolved as well . to study loop quantum geometry of black holes ,",
    "the simplest step is to consider the interior of a schwarzschild black hole , in which the metric components are homogeneous with kantowski - sachs symmetry . by virtue of homogeneity",
    ", the loop quantization of the schwarzschild interior can be formulated as a minisuperspace model in a similar fashion to lqc .",
    "this has been developed in @xcite and its effective solution has been investigated at the level of heuristic dynamics in @xcite based on the original quantization strategy ( also referred to as `` @xmath0-scheme '' ) and in @xcite based on the modified quantization strategies ( `` @xmath1-scheme '' and `` @xmath2-scheme '' ) . in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-schemes ,",
    "the black hole singularity is resolved by the quantum bounce , which bridges the black hole interior with a white hole interior . in the @xmath2-scheme ,",
    "the black hole singularity is resolved and the event horizon is also diffused by the quantum bounce , through which the black hole is connected to a baby black hole with a much smaller mass .",
    "both @xmath0- and @xmath1-schemes suffer from the problem that the resulting dynamics depends on the arbitrary choice of the finite sized comoving cell to which the spatial integration is restricted to make the hamiltonian finite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath2-scheme is independent of the choice of the finite sized cell and thus considered to be the correct quantization strategy in accordance with the idea of `` improved dynamics '' first suggested in @xcite and later generalized for bianchi i models in @xcite . as opposed to the results of the @xmath2-scheme heuristic dynamics , however , the spacetime curvature in the immediate vicinity of the event horizon can be fairly flat and does not necessarily incur any quantum corrections .",
    "the reason that the event horizon wrongly receives quantum corrections in the @xmath2-scheme is essentially because the finite sized cell collapses as its side surface shrinks when approaching the horizon .",
    "the collapse near the horizon is merely an artifact resulting from coordinate singularity ; in actual fact , a given finite sized cell will simply pass through the horizon without being collapsed .",
    "this glitch calls into question the minisuperspace treatment for the schwarzschild interior , even though it is legitimate for the kantowski - sachs cosmology as studied in @xcite .",
    "therefore , one is obliged to consider the black hole interior and exterior as a whole in the framework of spherically symmetric midisuperspaces .",
    "loop theories of spherically symmetric midisuperspaces are of theoretical importance in its own right , as they deal with the simplest field - theory framework which is symmetry - reduced .",
    "they provide an arena for testing important issues which are too difficult in the full theory and trivialized in minisuperspace ( lqc ) models .",
    "particularly , the @xmath3 internal gauge is reduced to @xmath4 and the 3-dimensional diffeomorphism is reduced to 1-dimensional , making the constraint algebra much simpler yet nontrivial .",
    "ashtekar s formalism for spherically symmetric midisuperspaces and its loop quantization have been studied and developed with different degrees of rigor @xcite . in this paper , we recapitulate results of previous works and elaborate on the geometrical meaning of the ashtekar variables and constraint algebra . for loop quantization , we suggest that some details have to be modified and propound a new quantization scheme which yields a graph - preserving hamiltonian constraint operator and by which one can impose the fundamental discreteness of lqg by hand _  la _ the strategy of improved dynamics in lqc .",
    "rigorous and complete construction for the loop quantum theory of spherically symmetric midisuperspaces is faced with complications and still challenging .",
    "nevertheless , ramifications of loop quantization and other open issues can still be inferred at the heuristic level of semiclassical dynamics .",
    "particularly , an effective solution corresponding to the semiclassical theory has been obtained for the complete schwarzschild spacetime which covers both the interior and exterior in @xcite , yielding a singularity - free global structure akin to that in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-schemes of the minisuperspace ( interior ) treatment in @xcite .",
    "the formulation of @xcite follows the strategy of @xcite to partially fix the 1-dimensional diffeomorphism gauge in such a way that one is left with a single abelian constraint and a true hamiltonian .",
    "the partial gauge fixing avoids the hard problem of having structure functions in the constraint algebra and thus makes the consistent loop quantum theory possible , but it also obscures significance of the interplay between the diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints . in this paper , we do not fix the diffeomorphism gauge but instead propose a new quantization scheme .",
    "the new quantization scheme does not resolve the complications of constructing a consistent loop quantum theory but nevertheless it yields profound insights at the heuristic level of semiclassical dynamics . remarkably ,",
    "consistency of constraint algebra in heuristic effective dynamics leads to fascinating consequences .",
    "first , requirement that the poisson bracket between the hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints has to weakly vanish fixes the improved quantization scheme to be of the same form as the @xmath2-scheme in minisuperspace ( lqc ) models @xcite .",
    "second , requirement that the poisson bracket between any two hamiltonian constraints ( with different lapse functions ) also has to weakly vanish further demands the inclusion of higher order holonomy corrections , which was first suggested in @xcite in the context of lqc but motivated differently .",
    "the second requirement also fixes a ratio factor of 2 for the improved quantization scheme , which remains ambiguous ( and is usually set to be 1 ) in homogenous models .",
    "analysis of the heuristic effective dynamics suggests that , with loop quantum corrections , the black hole singularity is resolved and replaced by a quantum bounce .",
    "the quantum bounce is expected to bridge a classical solution to another classical one , as the constraint algebra is exactly satisfied before and after the bounce , provided that the improved quantization scheme is adopted and higher order holonomy corrections are included to the order of infinity .",
    "the constraint algebra , however , breaks down briefly during the transition period of the bounce , implying that the spacetime is no longer invariant under spatial diffeomorphism and change of spacetime foliation after the bounce .",
    "nevertheless , the violation is minuscule at large scale and thus the heuristic effective dynamics remains reliable after the bounce insofar as large - scale physics is concerned . during the transition of the quantum bounce , the intimate matching between diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints is spoiled as a consequence of imposing fundamental discreteness .",
    "this indicates that , in the full theory of lqg , a given _ weave _ state ( coherent state of spin networks ) which represents a smooth , spherically symmetric space at large scale will eventually manifest granularity of spin networks when approaching the quantum bounce . in other words , close to the quantum bounce , the weave state becomes very granular to the extent that one can no longer make sense of symmetry reduction by separating out spherical degrees from non - spherical fluctuations . after the bounce",
    ", however , the weave state evolves to become smooth and spherically symmetric again .    to study the interior and exterior of the schwarzschild black hole at the same time",
    ", we choose the kruskal coordinates , which cover the entire manifold of the maximally extended schwarzschild spacetime ( i.e. kruskal extension of the schwarzschild spacetime ) @xcite .",
    "although the numerical method remains extremely challenging , inspection of the hamilton s equation at the level of heuristic effective dynamics still offers revealing insight about the characteristic natures of the loop quantum geometry of the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "firstly , the classical singularity is resolved and replaced by a quantum bounce which bridges the black / white hole interior to a different classical phase .",
    "secondly , inclusion of the hawking radiation is mandatory and thus the hawking evaporation is expected . these lead us to conjecture that the complete quantum schwarzschild spacetime manifests the similar structure of the 2-dimensional quantum black holes studied in @xcite : the black hole is evaporated via the hawking radiation , and the quantum spacetime",
    "is largely extended from the classical one as the black hole interior is extended beyond the putative singularity.the global structure of the quantum schwarzschild spacetime conjectured in this paper is very different from that obtained in @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy will be discussed in the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : preliminary analysis ] . ]",
    "the information paradox due to the hawking evaporation is believed to be resolved by the quantum extension of the classical spacetime as for the 2-dimensional black holes in @xcite .",

    "[ sec : loop quantization ] , loop quantization of spherically symmetric midisuperspaces is discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : heuristic dynamics ] , we study the heuristic effective dynamics and conjecture the quantum geometry of the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we end with a summary and discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "supplementary materials are included in the appendices .",
    "in this section , we formulate the canonical theory of gravity in terms of ashtekar variables for the spacetimes which admit spherical symmetry . we mainly follow the previous works in @xcite but give more details and expound on the physical meaning of the canonical variables and constraints .",
    "the adm formalism supposes that the 4-dimensional spacetime @xmath5 is foliated into a family of spacelike surfaces @xmath6 , labeled by the parameter time coordinate @xmath7 .",
    "further , we consider the cases that the topology of each of the `` leaves '' @xmath6 is of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a 1-dimensional manifold coordinatized by @xmath10 ( called `` radial coordinate '' ) and @xmath11 is a 2-sphere coordinatized by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "and @xmath14 corresponds to the horizon @xcite . for the interior of the schwarzschild black hole @xcite or for the kantowski - sachs cosmology @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath15 and one can further reduce the phase space to that of finitely many degrees of freedom by imposing homogeneity . in this paper , we take into account both the interior and exterior of the schwarzschild solution as a whole , and choose @xmath15 to be the horizontal coordinates in the kruskal diagram . ]",
    "if @xmath16 admits spherical symmetry ( i.e. , there are three killing vectors of @xmath11 that form the @xmath17 algebra ) , the ashtekar connection in the full theory is symmetry - reduced to the form of @xmath18d\\phi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are functions of @xmath10 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the pauli matrices are orthonormal generators of @xmath3 ( note @xmath25={\\epsilon_{ij}}^k\\tau_k$ ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , the densitized triad takes the form @xmath26 where again @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are functions of @xmath10 .",
    "note that the full ( 3 + 1 dimensional ) theory has been reduced by the spherical symmetry to a 1 + 1 dimensional theory . in the full theory , the connection is a one - form and the densitized triad is a vector density of weight 1 .",
    "but in the one dimension , under the coordinate transformation @xmath30 , @xmath19 transforms as a scalar density of weight 1 , i.e. @xmath31 , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 are scalars ; and @xmath27 transforms as a scalar , while @xmath28 and @xmath29 are scalar densities of weight 1.it is helpful to keep track of the density character of the canonical variables .",
    "for example , it can be used to check that @xmath32 defined in ( [ gauss constraint ] ) , @xmath33 in ( [ diff constraint ] ) and @xmath34 in ( [ hamiltonian constraint ] ) are scaler densities of weight 1 , weight 2 , and weight 1 , respectively .",

    "furthermore , the minus sign in the integrand in ( [ diff constraint ] ) is due to the fact that @xmath19 is a scalar density and @xmath27 is a scalar , while the pairs @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the other way around . also see footnote  [ foot : diff ] and appendix  [ app : dimension and weight ] . ]    in terms of the symmetry - reduced variables , the symplectic structure given by the symplectic two - form reads as : @xmath40 which implies    @xmath41    and all the other brackets vanish .",

    "the symmetric degrees of freedom can be treated as `` heavy '' degrees of freedom while the nonsymmetric degrees treated as `` light '' ones , in the sense of the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
