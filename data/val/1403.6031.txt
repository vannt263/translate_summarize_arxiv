    "young transiting planets could play a key role to distinguish planet formation scenarios , as it is possible to test evolutionary models with the well determined parameters of such planets , like radius , mass , and age .",
    "as no transiting planets with ages younger than @xmath0myr were found so far , we monitor young open clusters to search for transit signals among young stars . to increase phase coverage ,",
    "continuous observations are needed .",
    "therefore we established yeti ( young exoplanet transit initiative ) , a network of ground - based telescopes with mirror diameters of @xmath1 to @xmath2 m ( see neuhuser _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "fig.[fig : yeti_map ] shows a map with all telescope sites as well as the telescope sizes .",
    "each cluster is observed for at least three years with three campaign runs of lengths longer than one week .",
    "observations are done in the @xmath3-band .",
    "the first two target clusters of yeti were trumpler37 ( tr37 ) and 25ori .",
    "some properties of both clusters are summarized in tab.[tab : cluster_prop ] .",
    "the monitoring of tr37 started in summer 2009 at the university observatory jena .",
    "data of the yeti telescopes were gathered in summers 2010 and 2011 , each year three campaign runs were performed .",
    "the observations of 25ori at the university observatory jena started in january 2010 .",
    "in this first phase of the observation two additional telescopes ( gunma / japan and cida / venezuela ) joined the photometric monitoring in january and february 2010 .",
    "25ori became a target of the yeti project in the winter seasons 2010/2011 , 2011/2012 , and 2012/2013 .",
    "fifteen different observatories , spread worldwide at different longitudes , participated in the campaigns .",
    "data reduction ( dark / bias and flat - field correction ) as well as aperture photometry with adjusted aperture to the seeing conditions was done night by night and telescope by telescope . for a particular star ,",
    "the final lightcurve was created by doing differential photometry ( broeg _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) for all nights and telescopes on a small sample of comparison stars ( similar brightness and color , small angular distance ) .",
    "a detailed description can be found in errmann _",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "lcc & trumpler37 & 25ori + age [ myr ] & @xmath4 [ 1 ] & 7 - 10 [ 2 ] + distance [ pc ] & @xmath5 [ 3 ] & @xmath6 [ 4 ] + number member stars & 774 [ 5 ] & @xmath7 [ 6 ] +   +    fig.[fig : timecoverage ] shows the time coverage of the observations for a star in tr37 for the third yeti campaign in 2011 . as the star is located in a larger separation to the cluster center , it does not fit into the field of view of some telescopes .",
    "furthermore , not all telescopes could always allocate time and some suffer from seasonal bad weather , hence only 5 of the yeti sites are present .",
    "but even with that smaller number of telescopes , we could observe nearly continuously for @xmath8h at the end of the campaign .",
    "fig.[fig : phasecoverage ] shows the phase coverage of the same star . for a period up to 10d we reach 100% phase coverage and even for a period of 50d",
    "the phase coverage is better than 70% .",
    "the coverage at periods of a multiple of a full day is slightly worse , as a telescope in the pacific ocean is missing .",
    "in the tr37 data two transit candidates were found using a simple box fitting algorithm .",
    "another transiting candidate , first reported in van eyken _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) , is also visible in the 25ori data from yeti .",
    "at the late f - type star ( @xmath9mag ) , a transit - like signal of @xmath10mmag and period @xmath11d is visible . the time and phase coverage for this star is shown in fig.[fig : timecoverage ] and fig.[fig : phasecoverage ] , respectively .",
    "the follow - up observations of this candidate are already finished and will be presented in detail in errmann _",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we got a high - quality light curve in the @xmath12-band and a low - resolution spectrum from _ cafos _ at the 2.2 m telescope at calar alto .",
    "a medium - resolution spectrum was taken with _ hectochelle _ at mmt .",
    "the host star has a late f spectral type .",
    "eclipsing background stars in the optical point - spread function could be ruled out from high - resolution images from ircs observations at subaru . to solve the radial velocity orbit ,",
    "5 high - resolution spectra were observed with _",
    "hires _ at keck - i . as the latter observations were done near the quadratures , the line shifts are already visible by eye in fig .  [",
    "fig : keck - spec ] .",
    "the radial velocity variations of @xmath13km / s semi - amplitude are too large for a sub - stellar mass companion , hence we found a false positive .",
    "the mass of the companion is about 0.15 to 0.35m@xmath14 .    adu . between the spectra of the two nights the shifts of the lines",
    "are visible . ]",
    "the @xmath15mag bright star shows a transit - like lightcurve with a period of @xmath16d and depth of @xmath17mmag .",
    "additional , semi - periodic brightness variations of @xmath18mmag over time scale of @xmath19d are visible .",
    "we are actively working on the follow - up observations of this candidate .",
    "the host star ( cvso30 ) is a weak - lined t  tauri star and therefore very active .",
    "this causes brightness variations up to @xmath20mmag , while the depth of the transit is only @xmath21mmag ( see fig.[fig : lc_25ori ] ) .",
    "an interesting feature of the transit light curve of cvso30 was mentioned by van eyken _",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "they observed two sets of light curves in the years 2009 and 2010 .",
    "it can clearly be seen that there is an overall change in the transit shape between the two years data sets , which could be explained by gravity darkening of the host star ( barnes _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ) .",
    "further photometric follow - up can test the proposed spin - orbit misalignment .",
    "the monitoring of the clusters trumpler37 and 25ori with yeti has already finished , while the monitoring of ic348 , collinder69 , ngc1980 , and ngc7243 is ongoing .",
    "it is expected to find more transiting candidates , as we improve our routines and do further data analysis .",
    "we thank all of the participating yeti observatories for the observations .",
    "all the participating observatories appreciate the logistic and financial support of their institutions and in particular their technical workshops .",
