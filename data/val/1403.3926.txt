    "the hormone auxin plays a crucial role in plant development  @xcite , yet the mechanisms through which it accumulates in certain cells and interacts with cell growth mechanisms remain largely unclear .",
    "the patterns formed during the growth of a plant are controlled by the local auxin concentration .",
    "for example , it is known that the distribution of auxin maxima in the shoot apex gives rise to the formation of primordia  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the distribution of auxin in the root tip coordinates cell division and cell expansion  @xcite . in models of root hair initiation , intra - cellular levels and gradients of auxin concentration influence the localisation of g - proteins , which in turn promote hair formation  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is known that the distribution of auxin in the leaf primordia mediates vascular patterning  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", many aspects of the molecular basis of these mechanisms have been unraveled and mathematical models of auxin transport have been proposed to explain growth and development  @xcite .",
    "computer simulations are often used to compare the model output with observed data such as auxin distribution , venation patterns , growth or development . at cellular level",
    ", carriers such as pin - formed ( pin ) proteins , which are localised in the cell membrane , determine the rate and direction of auxin transport .",
    "the coordinated activity of many cells can create peaks of auxin that drive differentiation and growth .",
    "various models that implement and refine these ideas have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "such models differ primarily in the specifics of the transport and the coupling to the cell growth and division , but a common feature is that they generate spatially - extended patterns of auxin concentration , which have also been observed experimentally .",
    "existing transport models can be classified into two main categories , _ flux - based _ and _ concentration - based _ , depending on how auxin influences the localization of transport mediators ( pins ) to form patterns . in flux - based models ,",
    "first proposed in  @xcite , the polarization depends on the net auxin flux between neighbouring cells : the higher the net flux towards the neighbours , the more pin will accumulate at the membrane , and changes in the pin distribution determine changes in auxin fluxes .",
    "by contrast , in concentration - based models it is assumed that the pin accumulation on the membrane is caused by differences in auxin concentration between neighbouring cells .",
    "this type of models was introduced in  @xcite and  @xcite . for other reviews on flux- and concentration - based models we refer the reader to  @xcite .    in the models mentioned above",
    ", patterns are found by direct numerical simulation , upon choosing control parameters within a plausible biological range .",
    "however , there is still a large uncertainty on many of the parameter values which are often approximated  @xcite , adopted from different systems  @xcite or estimated with large error margins  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is unclear what is the effect of systematic parameter variations on the generated patterns and how this relates to the behaviour of the biological system : understanding the formation of auxin peaks from a dynamical system standpoint is still an open problem , therefore a mathematical exploration of the parameter variations may generate new , experimentally testable hypotheses , thereby gaining insight into pattern formation mechanisms  @xcite .    in spite of the uncertainty on experimental parameters",
    ", it is believed that active transport is a key player in auxin patterning  @xcite .",
    "transport models posses an inherent time - scale separation : the growth hormone dynamics involve short time scales ( of the order of seconds ) @xcite , while changes in cellular shapes and proliferation of new cells occur on much slower time scales ( hours or days ) @xcite . in order to determine the distribution of auxin in the plant , it is then possible to concentrate on the fast time scale of the hormone transport , assume a static cell structure and study the plant tissue as a dynamical system , subject to variations in the active transport parameter .    in this paper",
    "we perform such exploration on concentration - based auxin models , which are studied using standard bifurcation analysis techniques  @xcite . in particular , we find steady states of the system and explore their dependence upon control parameters , investigating how patterns lose or gain stability in response to parameter changes .",
    "the aim is to predict qualitatively the distribution patterns that can occur for a certain parameter range and to understand transitions between different types of patterns .    at present , only a few papers regard transport models as dynamical systems : among them , reference  @xcite stands out for being a _ systematic _ analysis of flux- and concentration - based models , whose auxin patterns are studied by considering local interactions between cells . in the present paper , we take the analysis one step further , by finding steady states simultaneously in the whole tissue , and by studying the important effects of its boundedness on the auxin patterns .",
    "the main result of our analysis is that , in a large class of concentration - based models posed on finite tissues , peaks do not arise from an instability of the homogeneous steady state , as it was previously reported for unbounded tissues  @xcite : on regular bounded domains , the geometry of the tissue drives the formation of small auxin peaks , which nucleate without instabilities near the boundary .",
    "further , we investigate the effects of changes in the active transport coefficient , in the diffusivity coefficient and in the auxin production coefficient for two specific examples : the concentration - based model proposed by smith et al .",
    "@xcite and a more recent modification studied by chitwood et al .",
    "@xcite . in these systems",
    "the localised peaks , determined analytically for small values of the active transport coefficient , persist also for moderate and large values of this control parameter .",
    "we found that , owing to their boundedness , realistic tissues can select from a multitude of patterned configurations , characterised by a variable number of localised peaks and organised in a characteristic snaking bifurcation diagram .    snaking bifurcation diagrams",
    "are commonly found for localised states   arising in ( systems of ) nonlinear partial differential equations posed in one  @xcite , two  @xcite and three  @xcite spatial dimensions , as well as in discrete  @xcite and nonlocal systems  @xcite .",
    "however , this mechanism has never been reported for auxin models : solutions with localised peaks undergo a series of saddle - node bifurcations , giving rise to a hierarchy of steady states with an increasing number of bumps .",
    "a direct consequence of this mechanism is that the resulting patterns are robust against changes in the transport parameter and other control parameters as found , for instance , by sahlin et al .",
    "we argue that this mechanism could be a robust feature in several other types of concentration - based auxin models .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : resultssummary ] we summarise our working hypotheses and describe the main results of the paper ; in section  [ subsec : theexistenceof ] we present our calculations for a simple 1d tissue , giving a primer on bifurcation analysis for auxin models ; in section  [ subsec:2ddom ] we generalise our results to 2d tissues , which are further discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] ; finally , we provide a more formal presentation of our general asymptotic results in section  [ sec : materialsandmethods ] .",

    "the flat state ( 0 ) exists only for @xmath1 ; upon increasing @xmath0 , we find an attracting state with low auxin peaks at the boundary ( 1 ) , followed by several other attracting states with variable number of peaks ( 2 , 3 ) ; the tissue is able to select from different patterns , depending on the initial condition and on the value of @xmath0 . ]",

    "for instance , @xmath7 may contain the auxin concentration ( @xmath8 ) or both auxin and pin - formed1 concentrations ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "generically , the rate of change of the concentrations is expressed as a balance between production and decay within the cell , diffusion towards neighbouring cells and active transport , hence we study generic concentration - based auxin models of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 , are the production and decay functions , respectively , @xmath12 is a diffusion matrix , @xmath0 is the active transport parameter and @xmath13 are the active transport functions . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the fast time scale of hormone transport and hence consider plant organs as static cell structures , so the number of cells @xmath14 remains constant in time .",
    "we make two key assumptions :    [ hyp : domain ] cells are arranged in a regular domain , that is , they have all the same shape and size and they tessellate the tissue .",
    "we do not make any assumption on the dimensionality of the domain .",
    "[ hyp : nu ] the active transport functions can be expressed as @xmath15 where the functions @xmath16 , @xmath17 depend on the model choices .",
    "hypothesis  [ hyp : nu ] is a factorisation of the active transport functions that is met by several models in literature  @xcite : active transport between cell @xmath18 and @xmath19 is influenced by the respective concentrations @xmath7 and @xmath20 , but also by concentrations in the neighbours of cell @xmath18 . in section  [ subsec : twomodels ]",
    "we introduce examples of concrete models satisfying hypothesis  [ hyp : nu ] and in section  [ sec : materialsandmethods ] we derive explicit expressions for the corresponding functions @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "it is established in literature that concentration - based models are capable of reproducing auxin patterns that are found in sam experiments  @xcite , for biologically realistic values of the transport parameters . in this paper",
    "we will address the following questions : what type of patterns are generated by the class of models described above ?",
    "do they all predict the occurrence of auxin peaks ?",
    "what are the instabilities that lead to the formation of auxin peaks ?",
    "are auxin patterns robust to changes in the control parameters and initial conditions ?",
    "these question have been partially addressed in previous papers  @xcite , where analytical results have been obtained only for particular models and only for regular domains without boundaries , where all cells have the same number of neighbours .",
    "in such domains a homogeneous steady state @xmath21 , satisfying the balancing condition @xmath22 , is known to exist for all values of @xmath0  @xcite . in domains without boundaries ,",
    "the formation of peaks has been explained in terms of a turing bifurcation in the active transport parameter ( see figure  [ fig : sketch1d ] ) : peaks are formed all at once as @xmath0 is varied , and they derive from an instability of the homogeneous steady state . from a dynamical system viewpoint",
    ", however , we expect that boundary conditions and finite domain sizes affect the formation and selection of auxin patterns .",
    "the main result of our investigation is that the mechanism for the formation of peaks is radically different in tissues of finite size , and in particular :    [ res : homstate ] in finite domains , concentration - based models   satisfying hypotheses  [ hyp : domain][hyp : nu ] support a homogeneous equilibrium @xmath21 for @xmath1 but , generically , this homogeneous state is not present when @xmath23 .",
    "this result is a direct consequence of the geometry of the domain : an inspection of equation   shows that the active transport terms @xmath13 contain a nested sum over the neighbours of the cell @xmath18 and , in a finite domain , the number of neighbours varies from cell to cell , namely cells at the boundary of the regular tissue have fewer neighbours than cells in the interior ; consequently , @xmath24 is generally different from @xmath25 at the boundary , even when @xmath21 .",
    "the conclusion is that , on finite domains , peaks can not form with a turing bifurcation , since the homogeneous steady state exists for @xmath1 , but not for @xmath23 ( however small ) . for regular domains where the number of neighbours is the same for all cells , the turing mechanism is still possible . in addition , a turing bifurcation is also possible in any domain , provided that @xmath1 and diffusion is used as a bifurcation parameter . in this regime",
    ", however , the active transport is absent and the tissue is a standard medium with reaction - diffusion mechanisms , which is not a biologically valid hypothesis for auxin models .

    "the amplitude of small peaks is proportional to @xmath0 and @xmath29 .",
    "importantly , @xmath31 in the interior of regular domains , therefore peaks localise at the boundary and without bifurcations , as opposed to the turing scenario where they form everywhere owing to an instability of @xmath32 : the mechanism on finite domains is purely geometric , as the location of the peaks is determined by the factors @xmath29 .    [",

    "a similar derivation can be done for irregular domains , albeit the coefficients @xmath29 depend in this case on the local cellular volumes as well as the number of neighbours .    the analytical theory described above , which is presented in more detail in section  [ sec : materialsandmethods",
    "] , is valid only for small values of the active transport coefficient and does not explain the formation of peaks in the interior of the domain  @xcite . while it is difficult to make general analytical predictions for larger values of @xmath0 , it is possible to explore the solution landscape of specific models via numerical methods .",

    "when we pose chitwood model on the same irregular domain , the results are strikingly similar , as seen in figure  [ fig : irregularsnakingchitwood ] : peaks form initially at the top - left quadrant of the circular domain ( see patterns 1 and 2 in figures  [ fig : irregularsnaking ] and [ fig : irregularsnakingchitwood ] ) , confirming that it is the geometry of the tissue to drive the spots location .",
    "an inspection of the fully patterned tissues ( patterns 4 in figures  [ fig : irregularsnaking ] and [ fig : irregularsnakingchitwood ] ) reveal that model parameters and functional forms for the active transport functions have an influence on the size and structure of the peaks . variations in @xmath50 also confirmed the trend seen in figure  [ fig : bifdiagrammulti ] ( not shown ) .",
    "in this paper we investigated the origin of auxin peaks in generic concentration - based models and proposed a robust mechanism for their formation over short time scales , using a combination of asymptotic and numerical bifurcation analysis .",
    "the asymptotic calculations , valid for a class of models with identical cells and weak active transport , show that peaks emerge as boundary corrections to the homogeneous steady state : the peak amplitude depends on the local geometry and is higher in regions where cells have fewer neighbours , that is , next to the boundary .",
    "crucially , this is a direct consequence of the mathematical structure of the models considered here ( hypotheses [ hyp : domain][hyp : nu ] ) : since the active transport depends on the number of neighbours at distance @xmath68 from the @xmath18th cell via the geometric coefficients @xmath29 , then deviations from the homogeneous state will always appear at the boundaries , where the number of neighbours is different from the interior of the tissue .",
    "this mechanism is different from ( and not in contrast with ) the turing bifurcation scenario reported in previous studies on unbounded domains : on finite tissues , peaks do not emerge from instabilities of the flat state , but they simply morph from it for low values of @xmath0 .",
    "the most immediate consequence of our mathematical analysis is that , in concentration - based models , active transport and geometry concur to promote localisation of auxin peaks  @xcite .    in irregular domains ,",
    "a similar asymptotic analysis can be carried out , but the peak selection mechanism in this case also depends on the cellular volumes and contact areas , so we can not exclude a priori that peaks will form in the interior as well as on the boundary .",
    "a statistical characterisation of the peaks location in relation to the variance of the cellular array is possible and should be considered in future studies .",
    "the two models by smith  @xcite and chitwood  @xcite fit in the framework discussed above and , for these systems , we have provided numerical evidence that peaks persist for moderate and large values of the active transport rate @xmath0 : large - amplitude peaks are arranged on a snaking branch , which becomes slanted in 2d tissues .",
    "a major implication of the numerical findings of figures  [ fig : irregularsnaking][fig : irregularsnakingchitwood ] is that localised auxin peaks are observable : a slow experimental sweep in the active transport from low to high values should reveal an initial localisation of the peaks , which then progressively de - localise and fill the domain .",
    "conversely , if the active transport is kept constant , the tissue should be able to select from more than one pattern , depending on the initial condition .    since snaking is now recognised as the footprint of localisation in a wide variety of nonlinear media",
    ", we expect that bifurcation diagrams similar to the ones shown in this paper for the smith and the chitwood models might also arise generically .",
    "one class of models that are of interest and can be analysed via numerical bifurcation analysis are flux - based auxin models , which have not been studied in this paper . while numerical continuation is readily applicable to such models , they are likely to require a separate analytic treatment , as some of them do not possess the factorisation presented in hypothesis  [ hyp : nu ] .",
    "importantly , we find that the bifurcation scenario is influenced by the auxin production rate , since the selectable configurations depend sensitively on the balance between auxin production and active transport .",
    "the results in figure  [ fig : bifdiagrammulti ] ( also confirmed by the 2d irregular calculations of figures  [ fig : irregularsnaking ] and [ fig : irregularsnakingchitwood ] ) support the conclusion that if auxin production rate was decreased quasi - statically , either actively or passively , the organism would be able to switch from fully - patterned states to configurations with few peaks at the boundary .",
    "in addition , since the parameters of the concentration - based models considered here are scaled by cellular volumes , we expect tissues with different cell sizes to behave similarly : in tissues with larger @xmath139 , the snaking limits are expected to occur for larger values of @xmath0 , so as to keep the ratio @xmath140 constant ( and a similar reasoning is valid for the passive transport parameter @xmath39 ) .",
    "the conclusion reported above are naturally limited to experiments that are well approximated by concentration - based models , and for the plausible biological parameter values selected in the original papers by smith et al .",
    "@xcite and chitwood et al .",
    "we note that an experimental validation of the predictions presented here requires the ability to detect changes in the auxin distribution during development .",
    "an experimental technique that could help testing the predictions of these two models is the one recently proposed by brunoud et al .",
    "@xcite , which allows to visualise auxin with high spatio - temporal resolution .",
    "we note that it would be possible to apply numerical bifurcation analysis also to a modified model that accounted for markers dynamics and auxin - sensor interactions",
    ".    a further desirable property of the experimental setup would be the ability to stimulate auxin peaks locally ( thereby changing initial conditions ) and test whether the tissue settles to a new equilibrium . in view of the large uncertainty on the parameter values of the models",
