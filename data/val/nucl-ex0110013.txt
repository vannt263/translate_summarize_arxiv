    "directed and elliptic flow are defined by the and coefficients in the fourier expansion of the azimuthal distribution of particles relative to the reaction plane : 1 + 2 v_1 ( -_r ) + 2 v_2 ( 2(-_r ) ) , [ fourier ] where @xmath5 is the azimuthal angle of a particle and @xmath6 is the azimuthal angle of the reaction plane .",

    "since the observed event plane is not the true reaction plane , the observed coefficients have to be corrected by dividing by the resolution of the event plane , which is estimated by measuring the correlation of the event planes of subevents .",
    "the flow coefficients can also be obtained by the pair - wise correlation  @xcite of all the particles without refering to an event plane .",
    "this two - particle correlation method produces the squares of the coefficients , so that one has to take the square root of the correlation effect : v_n^2 = ( n(_i-_j ) ) _ i j .",
