    "energy harvesting has recently received a great deal of attention in wireless communication since it provides virtually perpetual energy supplies to wireless networks through scavenging energy from the environment . in particular , harvesting energy from the far - field radio - frequency ( rf ) signal transmissions is a promising solution , which opens a new avenue for the unified study of wireless energy transfer ( wet ) and wireless information transmission ( wit ) as radio signals are able to carry energy and information at the same time .",
    "there are two main paradigms of research along this direction .",
    "one line of work aims to characterize the fundamental trade - offs in simultaneous wet and wit with the same transmitted signal in the so - called simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) systems ( see e.g. , @xcite-@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "another line of research focuses on designing a new type of wireless network termed wireless powered communication network ( wpcn ) in which wireless terminals communicate using the energy harvested from wet ( see e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we studied a typical wpcn model , in which one hybrid access - point ( h - ap ) coordinates wet / wit to / from a set of distributed users in the downlink ( dl ) and uplink ( ul ) transmissions , respectively .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the wpcn suffers from a so - called `` doubly near - far '' problem , which occurs when a far user from the h - ap receives less wireless energy than a near user in the dl , but needs to transmit with more power in the ul for achieving the same communication performance due to the doubled distance - dependent signal attenuation over both the dl and ul . as a result ,",
    "unfair rate allocations among the near and far users are inured when their sum - throughput is maximized . in @xcite",
    ", we proposed to assign shorter / longer time to the near / far users in their ul wit to solve the doubly near - far problem , which is shown to achieve more fair rate allocations among the users in a wpcn .    on the other hand ,",
    "user cooperation is an effective way to improve the capacity , coverage , and/or diversity performance in conventional wireless communication systems . assuming constant energy supplies at user terminals",
    ", cooperative communication has been thoroughly investigated in the literature under various protocols such as decode - and - forward and amplify - and - forward ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "recently , cooperative communication has been studied in energy harvesting wireless communication and swipt systems ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) . however , how to exploit user cooperation in the wpcn to overcome the doubly near - far problem and further improve the network throughput and user fairness still remains unknown , which motivates this work .        in this paper , we study user cooperation in the wpcn for throughput optimization . for the purpose of exposition , we consider a two - user wpcn , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_systemmodel ] , where one h - ap broadcasts wireless energy to two distributed users with different distances in the dl , and the two users transmit their independent information using individually harvested energy to the h - ap in the ul through time - division - multiple - access ( tdma ) . to enable user cooperation",
    ", we propose that the near user which has a better channel than the far user for both dl wet and ul wit uses part of its allocated ul time and dl harvested energy to first help to relay the information of the far user to the h - ap and then uses the remaining time and energy to transmit its own information . under this protocol",
    ", we characterize the maximum weighted sum - rate ( wsr ) of the two users by jointly optimizing the time and power allocations in the network for both wet in the dl and wit in the ul , subject to a given total time constraint .",
    "the achievable throughput gain in the wpcn by the proposed user cooperation scheme is shown both analytically and through simulations over the baseline scheme in @xcite without user cooperation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ systemmodel ] presents the system model of the wpcn with user cooperation .",
    "section [ resourcealloc ] presents the time and power allocation problem to maximize the wsr in the wpcn , and compares the solutions and achievable throughput regions with versus without user cooperation .",
    "section [ simulationresult ] presents more simulation results under practical fading channel setups .",
    "finally , section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "as shown in fig . [ fig_systemmodel ] , this paper considers a two - user wpcn with wet in the dl and wit in the ul .",
    "the network consists of one hybrid access point ( h - ap ) and two users ( e.g. , sensors ) denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , operating over the same frequency band .",
    "the h - ap and the users are assumed to be each equipped with one antenna .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that the h - ap has a constant energy supply ( e.g. , battery ) , whereas @xmath0 and @xmath1 need to replenish energy from the received signals broadcast by the h - ap in the dl , which is then stored and used to maintain their operations ( e.g. , sensing and data processing ) and also communicate with the h - ap in the ul .",
    "we assume without loss of generality that @xmath1 is nearer to the h - ap than @xmath0 , and hence denote the distance between the h - ap and @xmath0 , that between the h - ap and @xmath1 , and that between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , respectively , with @xmath5 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath6 so that @xmath1 can more conveniently decode the information sent by @xmath0 than the h - ap , to motivate the proposed user cooperation to be introduced next . assuming that the channel reciprocity holds between the dl and ul , then the dl channel from the h - ap to user @xmath7 and the corresponding reversed ul channel are both denoted by a complex random variable @xmath8 with channel power gain @xmath9 , @xmath10 , which in general should take into account the distance - dependent signal attenuation and long - term shadowing as well as the short - term fading .",
    "in addition , the channel from @xmath0 to @xmath1 is denoted by a complex random variable @xmath11 with channel power gain @xmath12 .",

    "<S> this paper studies user cooperation in the emerging wireless powered communication network ( wpcn ) for throughput optimization . for the purpose of exposition , we consider a two - user wpcn , in which one hybrid access point ( h - ap ) broadcasts wireless energy to two distributed users in the downlink ( dl ) and the users transmit their independent information using their individually harvested energy to the h - ap in the uplink ( ul ) through time - division - multiple - access ( tdma ) . </S>",
    "<S> we propose user cooperation in the wpcn where the user which is nearer to the h - ap and has a better channel for dl energy harvesting as well as ul information transmission uses part of its allocated ul time and dl harvested energy to help to relay the far user s information to the h - ap , in order to achieve more balanced throughput . </S>",
    "<S> we maximize the weighted sum - rate ( wsr ) of the two users by jointly optimizing the time and power allocations in the network for both wireless energy transfer in the dl and wireless information transmission and relaying in the ul . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results show that the proposed user cooperation scheme can effectively improve the achievable throughput in the wpcn with desired user fairness .    </S>",
