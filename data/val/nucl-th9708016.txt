    "recently the behavior of vector mesons in a nuclear surrounding became a lively debated issue .",
    "this was especially triggered by the new ceres experiments for s - au and pb - au collisions which show an enhancement of the dilepton yield for invariant masses somewhat below the vacuum mass of the @xmath0 meson @xcite .",
    "as argued some years ago by brown and rho this enhancement might be due to the restoration of chiral symmetry @xcite . in their approach",
    "the masses of the vector mesons scale with the quark condensate , i.e.  drop with rising baryonic density .",
    "thus the @xmath0 peak in the dilepton spectrum ought to be shifted to lower invariant mass which indeed might be an explanation for the observed enhancement of the dilepton yield in that region @xcite .",
    "however , also other scenarios utilizing the idea of chiral symmetry restoration are possible which predict a rising @xmath0 mass based on the effect that the @xmath0 becomes degenerate with its chiral partner , the @xmath1 meson @xcite .    on the other hand , some calculations based on purely hadronic models gave rise to an alternative picture .",
    "due to modifications of the pions in nuclear medium which at least in vacuum form the most important decay channel of the @xmath0 meson the spectral function of the @xmath0 might be drastically changed @xcite .",
    "in addition , collisions of the vector meson with nucleons from the fermi sea also influence the spectral function of the former @xcite . both pion modifications and collisions with nucleons",
    "at least lead to a broadening of the @xmath0 peak , if not to completely new structures .",
    "hence the enhancement in the dilepton yield might also be explained within a purely hadronic scenario where a lot of strength is shifted to lower invariant mass if the @xmath0 peak becomes much broader basically without changing its pole position @xcite .",
    "qualitatively the brown - rho scenario was supported by qcd sum rule analysis which showed a dropping of the @xmath0 mass , _ if _ the spectral function of the @xmath0 is simply modeled by a @xmath2-function @xcite . on the other hand , the hadronic models cited above seem to indicate that this approximation might no longer be appropriate if the vector meson is placed in a medium e.g.  with the saturation density of nuclear matter .",
    "a more sophisticated ansatz for the spectral function of the @xmath0 meson including pion corrections caused by the nuclear surrounding was explored in @xcite . inserting this spectral function in the hadronic part of the qcd sum rule basically the same dropping of the @xmath0 mass as from the simple pole ansatz",
    "was extracted . however , in @xcite , where also @xmath0-nucleon scattering was taken into account , no mass shift but only a large peak broadening was found .",
    "it was shown there that even then agreement between the left and the right hand side of the sum rule could be obtained .",
    "this finding clearly casts some doubt on the quantitative predictive power of the qcd sum rule analysis .",
    "it seems that only after one has chosen his favorite hadronic model the sum rule can tell whether this model is in agreement with the operator product expansion of qcd .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to explore in a systematic and as far as possible model independent way which spectral functions for the @xmath0 meson actually are compatible with qcd sum rules .",
    "to do so we choose a simple breit - wigner parametrization for the spectral function treating the pole position and the on - shell width as toy parameters . varying these parameters we calculate the difference of the left and right hand side of the sum rule . according to the finding of the two groups cited above @xcite",
    "we do not expect to find one single set of reasonable parameters but at least a line or a whole band of parameter pairs .",
    "of course , sophisticated hadronic models yield much more complicated spectral functions than the one we will use here .",
    "however , since the spectral function appears only in an integral in the sum rule ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule ] ) below ) we expect that the sum rule is not sensitive to the details of the modeling of the spectral function , but only to its gross features .",
    "therefore we believe that our analysis using a simple breit - wigner parametrization is also applicable to more sophisticated hadronic models .    in the next section we briefly recapitulate the derivation of the qcd sum rule for the @xmath0 meson in vacuum as well as in a nuclear medium . in section [ sec : param ] we present our parametrization for the spectral function .",
    "numerical results are given in section [ sec : exam ] .",
    "finally we summarize our results in [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we start with the time ordered current - current correlator @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the electromagnetic current of the @xmath0 meson , @xmath5 in the following we will write down all formulae for the case of finite nuclear density @xmath6 .",
    "the vacuum case is recovered by simply putting @xmath6 to zero .    at finite baryo - chemical potential lorentz invariance",
    "is broken . from @xmath7 and",
    "the baryonic current one can construct two independent projectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 which both still satisfy current conservation @xmath10 ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "hence the correlator can be decomposed in the following way : @xmath11 the scalar functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 in general depend on @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 is defined in the rest frame of the nuclear medium . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves here to the case of vanishing @xmath16 , i.e.  where the @xmath0 meson is at rest relative to the baryonic current . in this case @xmath12 and @xmath13 become equal , @xmath17 actually , most of the calculations concerning qcd sum rules for vector mesons in medium were performed for this special case , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "only recently there appeared growing interest in the explicit @xmath16 dependence of the @xmath0 spectral function @xcite .",
    "the traditional approach to qcd sum rules for vector mesons , i.e.  the pole + continuum ansatz , was recently generalized to finite @xmath16 by lee @xcite .",
    "a generalization of the approach presented here to finite @xmath16 is in progress .    for large space like four - momenta",
    "the correlator ( [ eq : curcur ] ) and thus the scalar function @xmath18 can be calculated from the operator product expansion ( ope ) of qcd @xcite .",
    "utilizing a subtracted dispersion relation one can make contact with the time like region by ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath19 where we have introduced @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a subtraction constant .",
    "now the basic idea of qcd sum rules is to calculate the l.h.s .  of ( [ eq : disp ] ) by the ope and the r.h.s .",
    "by a hadronic spectral function .    following @xcite the ope for the dimensionless quantity @xmath22 including condensates up to dimension 6",
    "is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the contribution from the scalar condensates , @xmath25 the last two contributions to ( [ eq : decconr ] ) arise from the non scalar condensates @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the medium dependence of the condensates is taken into account in leading order in the baryon density @xmath6 @xcite ( for a review on qcd sum rules in nuclear matter cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for the scalar condensates",
    "this yields @xmath28 and @xmath29 we take the following numerical values ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) for +  the strong coupling constant , @xmath30 +  the current quark mass , @xmath31 +  the vacuum two quark condensate , @xmath32 +  the vacuum gluon condensate , @xmath33 +  the nucleon sigma term , @xmath34 +  and the nucleon mass in the chiral limit , @xmath35 + the factors @xmath36 and @xmath37 are determined from the quark parton distributions .",
    "we use the values @xcite @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "finally @xmath40 parametrizes the deviation of the four quark condensate from the product of two quark condensates , i.e.  from the hartree approximation .",
    "this value is still not very well determined .",
    "therefore we will choose different values for @xmath40 to check the sensitivity of our results .",
    "following @xcite , respectively , we take @xmath41 and neglect a possible @xmath6 dependence of @xmath40 as is done usually in such studies @xcite .",
    "this is , however , a point that clearly deserves more attention since model studies @xcite show that in the case of finite density the rpa excitations out of positive energy states counteract the effects of the particle - antiparticle excitations .",
    "it is important to note that we have not taken into account all condensates up to dimension 6 .",
    "especially , we have neglected higher twist operators since they are smaller than the twist two contributions @xcite and their determination from the experiment is not very accurate yet .",
    "their influence on the ope for the vector mesons in medium is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the convergence of the ope can be improved by applying a borel transformation to ( [ eq : disp ] ) .",
    "the final result is ( see e.g.  @xcite for details about the borel transformation ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the borel mass and we have introduced the label had to stress that @xmath44 is calculated from a hadronic model .",
    "in addition , we have absorbed the subtraction constant @xmath45 appearing in ( [ eq : disp ] ) into @xmath44 .",
    "it is given by the landau damping contribution @xcite presented in the following section .",
    "following previous works @xcite we decompose @xmath44 in three parts , the contribution from the @xmath0 meson , the continuum part , and the landau damping contribution : @xmath46 the sum rule we will examine in the following is obtained from ( [ eq : botr ] ) by inserting the decomposition ( [ eq : hacola ] ) and taking the continuum and landau damping contributions to the r.h.s .",
    ", @xmath47 if strict vector meson dominance ( vmd ) is applied then @xmath48 would be the spectral function of the @xmath0 meson ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "since we are examining only a parametrization of @xmath48 in the following we do not have to specify whether we are using vmd or not .",
    "anyway we will refer to @xmath48 as a spectral function .",
    "the key issue now is the choice for the spectral function @xmath48 .",
    "clearly in vacuum the spectral function shows a single peak structure which is , of course , at the position of the free @xmath0 mass .",
    "in a nuclear medium we have no guideline from experiment how the spectral function might look like . however , examining the hadronic functions presented in the literature ( e.g.  @xcite ) we also find single peak structures , possibly somewhat shifted as compared to the vacuum case .",
    "thus we will also model our spectral function such that it shows one peak at invariant mass @xmath49 with width @xmath50 .",
    "we will treat these two quantities as free parameters to figure out which combinations of them are actually compatible with ope .",
    "we choose the following parametrization @xmath51 i.e.  we especially neglect a possible @xmath52 dependence of the mass parameter .",
    "since the integral appearing in ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) is obviously sensitive to the behavior of @xmath53 for small values of @xmath52 it is important to model the threshold behavior of @xmath54 in a physically reasonable way . in vacuum",
    "the spectral function is dominated by the decay of the @xmath0 into two pions .",
    "taking into account the phase space as well as the derivative coupling of the @xmath0-@xmath55-@xmath55 vertex we find the threshold behavior @xmath56 keeping things as simple as possible we use for the vacuum case @xmath57 with the constant @xmath50 being the on - shell width of the vector meson . for a more sophisticated parametrization of the spectral function in connection with qcd sum rules in vacuum",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "for finite nuclear density not only the decay into pions but also the scattering with nucleons influences the spectral function .",
    "the latter effect also contributes below the two pion threshold .",
    "if the fermi motion of the nucleons is neglected the threshold for the spectral function of a @xmath0 meson _ at rest _ is now given by the mass of one pion since the lightest pair of particles which can be formed in the @xmath0-nucleon collision is a nucleon and a pion .",
    "the threshold behavior is dominated by the lowest possible partial wave . without any additional constraint from the intermediate state formed in the @xmath0-nucleon collision",
    "we assume it to be an s - wave state .",
    "hence we get @xmath58 and thus @xmath59 if one wants to study the sum rule for very low densities both thresholds ( one and two pion masses ) are relevant . in this case one",
    "has to think about a description how to smoothly switch on the one pion threshold with increasing density . in the following ,",
    "however , we will concentrate on the case of saturation density of nuclear matter . here , if the width is chosen large enough , there is already a lot of strength in the spectral function below the two pion threshold .",
    "hence the two pion threshold does not influence the gross features of the spectral function for the densities we are interested in .",
    "we note that there are remarkable exceptions from the single peak structure by mentioning two examples : first , if the spectral function of the @xmath0 in medium is modeled by a pion loop where the pions are dressed due to medium effects a second sharp peak at low invariant mass shows up besides the usual broad @xmath0 peak @xcite .",
    "second , a two pole structure with two maxima appears if collisions with nucleons from the fermi sea are taken into account for the calculation of the @xmath0 spectral function .",
    "this additional pole is basically generated by the coupling of the nucleon-@xmath0 system to the @xmath60 resonance @xcite .",
    "such spectral functions are clearly not covered by our toy spectral function .",
    "therefore strictly speaking , our parametrization is still model dependent .",
    "however we cover a large class of models with our ansatz since the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) is not sensitive to the details of the spectral function but only to its gross features like the threshold behavior .",
    "having set up our formalism we can ask which values for mass @xmath49 and width @xmath50 are compatible with ope , i.e.  which set of parameters can be inserted in ( [ eq : spec ] ) such that the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) is satisfied . of course the sum rule is not valid for arbitrary values of the borel mass @xmath43 . if @xmath43 becomes too small the expansion in orders of @xmath61 breaks down . on the other hand for very large values of @xmath43 the contribution from perturbative qcd completely dominates the sum rule . in this case",
    "we are no longer sensitive to the parameters we are interested in . in @xcite",
    "the following recipe was suggested to determine a reasonable borel window : the minimal @xmath43 is determined such that the terms of order @xmath62 on the r.h.s .  of ( [ eq : botr ] ) contribute no more than @xmath63 to the total value of the r.h.s .",
    "for the maximal @xmath43 we require that the continuum part is not larger than the contribution of the spectral function to the l.h.s .",
    "of ( [ eq : botr ] ) , i.e. @xmath64    for given values of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 we calculate the relative deviation of the l.h.s .  from the r.h.s .  of ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) and",
    "average these deviations over the borel window defined above , schematically @xmath67 with @xmath68 since we are mainly interested in the ranges of reasonable values for mass and width we still have to determine @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we use the following strategy : for given values of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath66 we fix @xmath65 by the finite energy sum rule @xcite , @xmath69 hence @xmath70 for given values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath66 is determined by the requirement that @xmath71 in ( [ eq : diffdef ] ) ought to be minimal .",
    "now we require two criteria for a pair of parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 to hold .",
    "first , the difference @xmath71 as given in ( [ eq : diffdef ] ) should be reasonably small . in the following",
    "we will explore the region of parameter pairs which fulfill @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "second , the borel window as defined in ( [ eq : delm ] ) should be reasonably large . in @xcite a window of @xmath74gev@xmath75",
    "was found for the vacuum case in the traditional sum rule approach ( vanishing width ) . as shown in @xcite",
    "the borel window shrinks with increasing nuclear density . at nuclear saturation density",
    "the extension of the borel window was found to be @xmath76gev@xmath75 . for vanishing width",
    "these are , of course , optimal values and not lower limits . in our calculations",
    "we require the window @xmath77 to be larger than @xmath76gev@xmath75 for the vacuum case ; for nuclear saturation density we take a value of @xmath78gev@xmath75 as a lower limit for @xmath77 .",
    "the parameter pairs which fulfill both criteria are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : vac],[fig : med ] for vacuum and nuclear saturation density for the values for @xmath40 as given in ( [ eq : valkappa ] ) .",
    "to get an idea how the two criteria influence the final result we have disentangled them in fig .",
    "[ fig : vac ] for the vacuum case and @xmath79 .",
    "if no constraint on the width of the borel window is imposed the left one of the dashed lines is replaced by the dotted line .",
    "( the other lines stay the same . )",
    "obviously the window criterion gives an important constraint by cutting off low values of the mass .",
    "if the lower limit for @xmath77 is increased the corresponding line ( the left dashed one ) would move further to the right . in all the other plots of figs .",
    "[ fig : vac],[fig : med ] the line which is most to the left is determined by the window criterion .    for the strict requirement @xmath80 and for @xmath81",
    "we find only a small band of parameters for the vacuum case and no parameters for the case of nuclear saturation density .",
    "note , however , that hatsuda _",
    "@xcite who used @xmath81 took a somewhat larger value for the two quark condensate .",
    "this would presumably yield a picture similar to our case @xmath82 , at least for vacuum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vac ] ) . actually , only for the choice @xmath82 the experimental values for the vacuum case , @xmath83gev and @xmath84gev , can be found inside the parameter range which is in accordance with @xmath80 .",
    "this is however not surprising since @xmath82 together with the values for the condensates we have used here are the result of an optimization to fulfill the sum rule in vacuum reasonably well @xcite .",
    "the authors who have used the values @xmath85 also use different values for the other condensates . clearly , it would be of interest to see how a variation of the other condensate values influences our results . for simplicity",
    "we have restricted ourselves here to a variation of @xmath40 , only .",
    "the values for @xmath66 , @xmath65 , and the borel window , of course , differ for each pair of parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "to get some idea about their magnitudes we have listed in table [ tab : tab ] their values for some selected parameter pairs .",
    "one can clearly observe the tendency of the continuum threshold @xmath66 to decrease with increasing density .",
    "this is in agreement with the results from the traditional sum rule approach @xcite and was used as an input in the analysis of @xcite . to demonstrate that also the values for @xmath65 as determined from the finite energy sum rule ( [ eq : fesr ] ) are in a reasonable range we take @xmath86gev@xmath87 as derived for the vacuum case with @xmath82 for the physical values @xmath83gev and @xmath84gev ( cf .",
    "table [ tab : tab ] ) . assuming vector meson dominance @xmath65",
    "is indeed given by @xmath88gev@xmath87 @xcite where @xmath89 is the @xmath0-@xmath55-@xmath55 coupling constant .",
    "also f decreases with increasing density reflecting the redistribution of @xmath0-strength in the medium .",
    "the results in figs .",
    "[ fig : vac],[fig : med ] are in qualitative agreement with previous work for all values of @xmath40 . for vanishing width",
    "the mass decreases with increasing density .",
    "this is the result of the traditional sum rule approach .",
    "however , with increasing width the window of `` good '' values for @xmath49 is shifted to the right , i.e.  to larger values . for finite density",
    "this shift becomes even stronger .",
    "this confirms the finding that for a small value of the width the mass drops in medium @xcite , while for a large value of the width the mass might stay constant @xcite .    with rising width",
    "the window for reasonable masses considerably grows if the weaker criterion @xmath73 is applied .",
    "therefore , the sum rule approach loses more and more of its predictive power . for e.g.  @xmath90 and @xmath73",
    "we find that for small width the mass can be determined reasonably well within an uncertainty of about @xmath91gev . for large width on the other hand the window of allowed values for the mass grows to @xmath92gev .",
    "this in turn means that in any hadronic model that leads to a large width for the spectral function of the rho meson any agreement of the calculated mass with the qcd sum rule prediction is not a very strong statement . in any case",
    "our analysis shows that one can not extract model independent informations about the properties of the @xmath0 meson from the sum rules .",
    "as already mentioned , in all the figures the left one of the dashed lines is basically determined by the second criterion which requires that the borel window is reasonably large . if this criterion is removed the left one of the dashed lines would be placed much more to the left ( cf .",
    "[ fig : vac ] for @xmath82 ) .",
    "then the uncertainty in the determination of the mass for vanishing width would also be much larger than @xmath91gev .",
    "from the figures for different values of @xmath40 we find that the masses rise with growing @xmath40 . at first sight , one would tend to exclude the cases @xmath93 for vacuum since the experimental values for mass and width are not inside the parameter range supported by the sum rule .",
    "this , however , does not necessarily mean that these values for @xmath40 ought to be discarded for finite density , too . since @xmath40 might explicitly depend on the density the values we have used are not unrealistic a priori .",
    "[ fig : med ] shows that even for vanishing width a @xmath40 which grows with the density can compensate for the negative mass shift otherwise caused by the density and restore the vacuum value of the mass .",
    "we conclude that the sum rule analysis is still plagued by a large uncertainty in the determination of the condensate values , especially concerning the four quark condensate .",
    "we have presented a systematic study of the qcd sum rule for the @xmath0 meson to shed some light on the question which hadronic spectral functions for the @xmath0 meson are compatible with the operator product expansion of qcd . using a simple breit - wigner ansatz with the correct threshold behavior incorporated we explored the range of parameters for the @xmath0 mass and on - shell width which satisfy the qcd sum rule . from the qualitative point of view",
    "the important message is that there is not only one pair of reasonable parameters .",
    "quantitatively we find that for small ( large ) values of the mass also the width has to be small ( large ) .",
    "thus the lowest mass is given by the traditional calculations using a @xmath2-function for the spectral function @xcite .",
    "however , especially for large values of the width a large range of values for the mass would also be allowed .",
    "we conclude that specific properties of the @xmath0 meson in a nuclear medium can not be determined from qcd sum rules without specifying a hadronic model",
    ". instead the sum rules only provide a ( wide ) constraint for reasonable hadronic models .",
    "even then , the factorization of the four - quark condensate , i.e.  the dependence of any result on the parameter @xmath40 and its possible density dependence , introduces an additional uncertainty .",
    "nevertheless the sum rules are useful , first , to provide a constraint for reasonable hadronic models or , second , to incorporate additional medium dependences of hadronic parameters ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we stress again , however , that the sum rule loses its predictive power with increasing width since the window for values of the mass supported by the sum rule drastically grows . for any further study concerning the comparison of a hadronic model with the ope we suggest to quantify any statement about the agreement with the qcd sum rule .",
    "we advocate to use the criterion for a reasonably large borel window as presented by leinweber _",
