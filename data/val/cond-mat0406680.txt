    "quantum behaviour of low - dimensional molecular - based magnetic materials has become one of the most fascinating topics emerging at the border of condensed matter physics , materials science , and inorganic chemistry . in this area ,",
    "the quantum ferrimagnetic chains ( qfc ) have attracted considerable attention during the last few years , because they exhibit a remarkable combination of ferromagnetic ( f ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) features .",
    "@xcite in an attempt directed toward the synthesis and design of possible experimental realizations of qfc , a magnetostructural analysis of several bimetallic assemblies has been accomplished , @xcite since the mixed - spin chains afford their most simple and common representatives . up to now",
    ", the dual aspect of qfc has been experimentally confirmed in the [ nicu(pba)(d@xmath0o)@xmath1].2d@xmath0o @xcite and [ mncu(mal)@xmath0(h@xmath0o)@xmath3.2h@xmath0o @xcite mixed - spin chains .",
    "in addition to the mixed - spin chains , another class of the qfc constitute the bond alternating chains ( bac ) with an unusual fashion of exchange bonds . from the experimental point of view",
    ", the bond alternation in the 1d polymeric assemblies demands at least two structurally nonequivalent superexchange paths in order to get a series of alternating exchange bonds .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that bond alternation may also arise in a system with an uniform superexchange pathway as a result of the spin - peierls phenomenon , @xcite spontaneous dimerization , which occurs when the elastic energy increase connected with the lattice distortion is lower than the corresponding magnetic energy gain arising from the dimerization .",
    "hence , the recent discovery of the first inorganic spin - peierls compounds cugeo@xmath1 @xcite and @xmath4-nav@xmath0o@xmath5 @xcite gave rise to a number of theoretical works devoted to the spin-1/2 af - af bac .",
    "@xcite    another exciting field in molecular magnetism was opened up by haldane s conjecture , @xcite which has already been experimentally verified in several af nickel - based chains ( for a review of haldane gap compounds see ref . ) .",
    "as firstly pointed out by hida , @xcite additional insight into the striking properties of the spin-1 af chain can be acquired by analyzing the spin-1/2 f - af bac in the strong - f - coupling limit .",
    "@xcite accordingly , much effort has been addressed to prepare polymeric complexes , in which the f - af bond alternation should be realized . at present , there exist several copper - based polymeric compounds that fulfill this requirement @xcite ( see table i ) and haldane - like behavior has indeed been undoubtedly proved to occur in ( ipa)cucl@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite    .several examples of one - dimensional copper - based chains with alternating f and af interactions . [ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     of particular interest are also other bac with more peculiar bond alternation , especially with a longer repeating unit of exchange bonds ; namely , according to the oshikawa - yamanaka - affleck rule , @xcite one may expect the appearance of the magnetization plateau in any system with a longer period of the ground state .",
    "of course , this rule represents just a necessary condition for the plateau - state formation and does not directly prove its existence in any specific model .",
    "the theoretical investigations focused on the magnetization process of the spin-1/2 f - f - af bac thus revealed another interesting finding - the breakdown of the magnetization plateau .",
    "@xcite when the ratio between f and af coupling constants is strong enough in this system , the plateau state disappears from the magnetization curve . in agreement with this finding",
    ", there has not been found any plateau in the low - temperature magnetization curve of 3cucl@xmath0.2dx , @xcite which is regarded as a typical example of the spin-1/2 f - f - af bac with the strong f and weak af coupling .",
    "the versatility of the azido ligand in bridging the magnetic ions in various fashions is nicely demonstrated in the copper - based compound cu(3-clpy)@xmath0(n@xmath1)@xmath0 , @xcite hereafter abbreviated as ccpa .",
    "there is a strong evidence that this compound can be regarded as a spin-1/2 tetramer chain with the f - f - af - af bond alternation .",
    "@xcite however , the 1d nature of the ccpa can be attributed to a sufficient separation between chains , which is ensured by the large steric hindrance of the bulky 3-clpy ligands ( see fig .",
    "the peculiar f - f - af - af sequence of the exchange bonds arises , on the other hand , on account of two kinds of bridging fashions of the azido group : the magnetic cu@xmath6 ions are linked either in a double end - on , or in an end - on and end - to - end bridging fashion .",
    "it is quite well established @xcite that the end - on bridges are usually associated with the f coupling ( with exception when the bridging angle is too large ) , while the end - to - end bridges are responsible for the af coupling .",
    "the complete magnetic studies of the ccpa have been performed by hagiwara and co - workers : for a powder sample high - field magnetization and the susceptibility measurements were reported , @xcite while for a single - crystal sample the high - field magnetization and , susceptibility are known , @xcite as well as the specific heat @xcite and electron - spin resonance @xcite data .",
    "the primary purpose of this work is to provide a detailed description to the thermodynamic properties of the spin-1/2 f - f - af - af bac by means of a simplified ising - heisenberg model suggested in our preliminary report.@xcite due to the simplicity of the proposed hamiltonian as well as its low - dimensionality , an accurate analytical treatment for the complete set of thermodynamic quantities can be elaborated within an exact mapping transformation technique.@xcite to the best of our knowledge , there have been reported only a few rigorous results for the spin-1/2 f - f - af - af bac obtained by applying the exact diagonalization method for a finite - size heisenberg cluster @xcite and any further more comprehensive studies have not been reported in the literature hitherto.@xcite    the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section , we shall provide the detailed description of the model system and then , the basic ideas of transformation procedure will be presented .",
    "this is followed by the presentation of the most interesting results .",
    "an exhaustive survey of results for several thermodynamic quantities in the zero as well as non - zero external field is reviewed in section iiia , while a comparison with the relevant experimental data is included in section iiib .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are drawn in section iv .",
    "a fragment of the ccpa crystal structure is depicted in fig .",
    "1a . apparently , there are three nonequivalent positions of the cu@xmath6 ions due to two different kinds of azido bridges . to match the structural situation from the magnetic viewpoint , fig .",
    "1b schematically reproduces the magnetic structure of ccpa : the sites interacting purely via the f interaction @xmath7 are denoted as the cu1 sites , the sites coupled via both f as well as af interaction as the cu2 sites , and finally , the sites coupled purely through the af interaction @xmath8 are labeled as the cu3 sites . as a consequence of the structural differences , one also has to assume various @xmath9-factors @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 at the cu1 , cu2 , and cu3 sites , respectively .",
    "it is worthwhile to say that the supposed magnetic structure can also be identified as a ferromagnetic chain , the bonds of which are decorated by the af trimers ( fig .",
    "1b ) . owing to this fact",
    ", it is very advisable to assume that the f interaction @xmath7 has an ising - type character , whereas the af interaction @xmath8 may have the more general form of an anisotropic heisenberg coupling ( the detailed discussion will be given in section iii ) . under the circumstances , the model under consideration",
    "can be exactly treated by applying a generalized decoration - iteration mapping transformation .",
    "@xcite actually , this mapping procedure has been proved to be very useful in investigating several mixed - bond ising - heisenberg models , some of the present authors already obtained within this scheme exact results for the trimerized ising - heisenberg linear chain , @xcite the ising - heisenberg diamond chain @xcite , and some decorated ising - heisenberg planar models .",

    "for the spin only value of the on - site magnetization at the magnetically nonequivalent cu1 , cu2 and cu3 positions , we shall introduce this simple notation : @xmath63 where the symbol @xmath64 stands for a standard canonical average over the ensemble defined by the hamiltonian ( [ r1 ] ) . in view of this notation ,",
    "the total magnetization normalized per one cu@xmath6 ion can be expressed as follows : @xmath65 .",
    "finally , we briefly mention the basic thermodynamic relations from which all the analyzed quantities have been calculated after straightforward but a little bit lengthly calculations . the on - site magnetization can be obtained by differentiating the gibbs free energy with respect to the particular magnetic fields : @xmath66 while the susceptibility and specific heat have been obtained as the second derivatives of the gibbs potential using the standard thermodynamic relations : @xmath67 it should be stressed that the explicit form for these quantities is too cumbersome to write it down here ; however , it can be obtained from the authors on request .",
    "before proceeding to a discussion of the most interesting results , the model reliability should be checked in connection with its possible application to interpret the experimental data on ccpa , because a danger of overinterpretation is inherent in any approximation . at first glance ,",
    "we have made in our model a very crude conjecture in that the f interaction @xmath7 was approximated by an ising - type coupling although all cu@xmath6 ions are nearly isotropic , and whence , the heisenberg interaction would be more appropriate . with regard to this ,",
    "2 illustrates a comparison between the on - site magnetization of the ising - heisenberg bac and that of the corresponding pure heisenberg bac obtained from the exact diagonalization method for a finite - size cluster of 12 sites . @xcite it should be pointed out that the low - temperature ( @xmath68 ) magnetization curve provides the best independent test of the model reliability , since it reflects magnetization near the ground state , where the clearest manifestation of the quantum fluctuations should be expected to occur .",
    "it is quite surprising that there is such an excellent agreement between the two theories : the total magnetization ( for clarity not shown here , but see for instance fig .",
    "4 ) exhibits a steep increase from zero field followed by a magnetization plateau and finally , there appears a second steep increase near the transition field toward a fully polarized state .",
    "strictly speaking , there is no real phase transition at any finite temperature ; however , the low - temperature magnetization curve shed light on what happens in the ground state : the plateau state should reflect the ground - state phase and the field - induced transition to the fully saturated phase takes indeed place in the zero - temperature limit .",
    "moreover , the magnetic order at the plateau state has a typical feature of quantum ferrimagnet , in fact , one finds here a substantial quantum reduction of the magnetization @xmath69 and @xmath70 at the cu2 and cu3 sites even though the magnetization @xmath71 ( cu1 site ) retains its saturation value .",
    "it means , among other matters , that the spin deviations can not propagate through these sites and hence , they are strictly localized within the af trimers .",
    "this explains also the remarkable agreement between both the theories , since the quantum fluctuations are in our model artificially restricted to the af trimers because of the presence of the ising spins .",
    "the most obvious difference between the magnetization curve of the ising - heisenberg bac and the pure heisenberg bac can be thus found in the vicinity of the zero field , where the on - site magnetization of the former reaches their plateau values more rapidly .",
    "apparently , this distinction can be attributed to the more `` susceptible '' character of the ising spins , whereby their heisenberg counterparts achieve the plateau values more rapidly on behalf of the local field produced just by the ising spins . with this in mind , small systematic discrepancies should be expected to occur especially in the region where both @xmath72 and @xmath73 , but , without loss of the qualitative agreement .",
    "why the cu1 sites represent a `` barrier '' for the spin deviations also in the spin-1/2 heisenberg f - f - af - af bac still remains an open question .",
    "although the origin of this outstanding feature could be naively understood as a general feature of the spins coupled by the f interactions only , this suggestion is in an obvious contradiction with hida s results for the spin-1/2 f - f - af bac .",
    "@xcite as a matter of fact , the total magnetization of this system varies smoothly with increasing magnetic field even in the ground state , which implies that the spin deviations are delocalized over the whole chain and thus , there is a certain quantum reduction also at purely ferromagnetically coupled sites .      in this part ,",
    "an extensive survey of theoretical results will be presented in order to enable deep insight into the magnetic behavior of the system under investigation . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we shall firstly suppose equal @xmath9-factors at the cu1 , cu2 , and cu3 positions , i. e. @xmath74 .",
    "we start our discussion with the analysis of the ground state . below some critical external magnetic field",

    "as already mentioned in the preceding part , the magnetization @xmath71 retains in the ground state its saturation value in contrast to the magnetization @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which show obvious quantum reduction .",
    "it is quite evident that the stronger the exchange anisotropy @xmath23 , the greater the reduction of the magnetization @xmath69 and @xmath70 . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum reduction of the magnetization completely vanishes in the ising limit @xmath77 , when the ground state exhibits a `` classical '' ferrimagnetic order @xmath78 ( cu1cu2cu3cu2 ... ) of a rather trivial nature .",
    "as expected , the ferrimagnetic system undergoes a field - induced metamagnetic transition toward the fully saturated phase under the certain magnetic field .",
    "it can be readily proved that the transition field @xmath79 is given under the condition : @xmath80 for illustration , fig .",
    "3 displays the ground - state phase diagram in the @xmath81 plane for several values of the exchange anisotropy @xmath23 .",
    "as one can see , increasing strength of the f coupling @xmath7 generally reinforces the gradual decline of the transition field .",
    "thereby , the pure ising limit ( @xmath82 ) represents the only exceptional case when the magnitude of the transition field does not change as the ratio @xmath83 varies .",
    "it can be easily understood that the metamagnetic transition arises in this particular case from a single flip of the central ( cu3 ) spin of each af trimer , which occurs when the exchange energy of @xmath8 is thoroughly balanced by the external magnetic field ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the situation becomes much more complex on considering the nonzero exchange anisotropy @xmath23 . due to the quantum fluctuations , the spin oriented in an opposite direction with respect to the external field is no longer rigidly connected with the central spin of the af trimer , but is collectively held by the entire trimer . in other words , the reversed spin is delocalized over the whole af trimer and",
    "consequently there is a non - zero probability that the side ( cu2 ) spins of the trimer are aligned opposite to the field direction .",
    "naturally , this must lead to the enhancement of the exchange energy between the ferromagnetically coupled cu2 side spins and the fully polarized cu1 spins . in consequence of that , it is quite conspicuous that the suppression of the transition field can be explained in terms of the energetic destabilization of the quantum ferrimagnetic order , which occurs when @xmath83 increases .",
    "now , let us turn our attention to the magnetic behavior at finite temperatures . in fig .",
    "4 we plot the total magnetization scaled in @xmath85 units against the dimensionless magnetic field ( @xmath86 ) for a few temperatures .",
    "it should be pointed out that the magnetization curve starts at any finite temperature from zero according to the one - dimensional character of the spin system .",
    "the sharp stepwise magnetization curve observable in the zero - temperature limit is , however , gradually smeared out as the temperature is raised from zero .",
    "actually , the conversion toward the fully saturated phase does not occur merely at one precise value of the transition field , but is smudged over a finite range of the fields .",
    "in addition , the temperature - induced fluctuations greatly shrink also the width of the magnetization plateau and above a certain temperature , the plateau state completely disappears from the magnetization curve . by any means ,",
    "4 provides further convincing evidence that the observed magnetization plateau emerges , under the assumption of the uniform @xmath9-factors , exactly at one - half of the saturation magnetization [ see also eq .",
    "( [ r11 ] ) ] .",
    "the variation of the field - induced magnetization with the temperature ( fig .",
    "5 ) is also interesting on account of the magnetically ordered ground state . at low magnetic fields",
    ", the total magnetization tends abruptly to zero as the temperature increases .",
    "nevertheless , one finds here also a noticeable temperature - induced increase of the magnetization within a range of moderate fields , when the total magnetization shows a broad maximum resulting from a vigorous thermal excitations of the cu3 spins and smaller thermal excitations of the cu2 spins .",
    "however , when the magnetic field exceeds the transition field given by the condition ( [ r12 ] ) , the total magnetization monotonically decreases with increasing temperature as it already starts from its maximum value .",
    "the thermal dependence of the zero - field susceptibility times temperature ( @xmath87 ) data is displayed in fig .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath87 product exhibits a round minimum upon cooling and then diverges under further temperature suppression .",
    "as already discussed in several papers concerned with the qfc , @xcite a thermal dependence of this type reveals a ferromagnetic - to - antiferromagnetic crossover . really , the temperature variation of the @xmath87 data is in general a monotonically decreasing function for ferromagnets , but monotonically increasing for antiferromagnets . in this respect ,",
    "the marked low - temperature divergence of the susceptibility emerges markedly because of the gapless f excitations from the magnetically ordered ground state .",
    "the position of the round minimum , on the other hand , designates the temperature above which the gapped excitations of the af nature overhelm the gapless excitations originating from @xmath7 . in accordance with the above statement , the round minimum flattens as the ratio @xmath83 strengthens and simultaneously its position is shifted toward higher temperatures .",
    "as far as the magnetic susceptibility at nonzero fields is concerned ( fig .",
    "7 ) , the @xmath87 always initiates from zero because of the energy gap opened by the magnetic field .",
    "however , the thermal dependence of the @xmath87 data shows at weak fields a dramatic increase until it reaches a sharp maximum , which is followed by the familiar round minimum of the same origin , as already discussed by the zero - field susceptibility .",
    "the appearance of the additional sharp peak can obviously be related to a thermal instability of the magnetically ordered system , because already a small temperature change necessitates a huge variation of the magnetization at low fields ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the @xmath87 product rises steadily with the temperature at sufficiently strong fields , since the thermal fluctuations are not strong enough to induce a simultaneous excitation of a large number of spins .",
    "thus , an interesting thermal dependence of the susceptibility appears for strong magnetic fields just around the transition to the fully polarized state . under these circumstances ,",
    "the @xmath36-@xmath87 plot exhibits a rapid increase over a small temperature range , which is subsequently followed by a narrow plateau that continuously passes into a slowly repeating increase of the susceptibility ( see the curve @xmath88 ) .    to receive a complete picture of the thermodynamics ,",
    "the thermal variations of the specific heat are plotted in figs . 8 and 9 . when considering the zero - field case ( fig .",
    "8) , the specific heat displays as a function of the temperature a remarkable double - peak structure .",
    "there are strong indications that the first sharper peak observed at lower temperature originates from the f excitations : the peak becomes wider as the ratio @xmath83 increases and is shifted to higher temperatures notwithstanding its almost constant height . under the assumption of dominant f coupling constant ( @xmath89 ) , the low - temperature peak is to a large extent superimposed on the second broader maximum that occurs at a little bit higher temperature .",
    "obviously , the round high - temperature maximum can be thought of as the usual schottky - type maximum , which has a tendency to be enhanced in magnitude with increasing @xmath83 . when comparing the results displayed in fig .",
    "8 with those of the pure heisenberg f - f - af - af bac obtained using the exact diagonalization method @xcite or the transfer - matrix renormalization group @xcite , an excellent agreement is found as far as the high - temperature maxima of both these models are concerned .",
    "the only difference thus rests in the height of the low - temperature peak which is , due to the ising approximation of @xmath7 , roughly three - times higher for the ising - heisenberg bac compared to that of the pure heisenberg bac ( see for instance the insert of fig . 4 depicted in ref . ) .",
    "the situation becomes even much more interesting on applying a magnetic field ( fig .",
    "the effect of a small magnetic field is to increase the height of the low - temperature peak and to move it toward higher temperatures ( see the case @xmath90 ) .",
    "this result is taken to mean that under a certain field both maxima coalesce and consequently , the specific heat exhibits a single nonrounded maximum as shown for @xmath91 . by an additional increase of the field strength",
    ", the specific heat curve gradually loses its irregular profile and the overall trend is that the schottky - type maximum drops in magnitude and moves to higher temperatures .",
    "apart from this rather trivial finding , the double - peak specific heat curve can be recovered for the fields close to the transition to the fully saturated phase ( e.g. @xmath92 ) .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that the height of the low - temperature peak is in this case considerably smaller than that of the zero - field specific heat .",
    "although the external field spreads also this low - temperature peak until it completely merges with the schottky - type maximum , the change of the peak position occurs strikingly without any significant change of the peak height ( for clarity , this effect is not shown here ) .",
    "finally , it should be stressed that the observed behavior of the specific heat is not a generic feature of the special class of the ising - heisenberg bac , nevertheless , it has already been recognized also in the pure ising bac ( compare with figs . 4 and 8 from ref . ) .",
    "we conclude our survey of the thermodynamic properties by considering the nonuniformity of the @xmath9-factors at the structurally and therefore also magnetically nonequivalent cu1 , cu2 and cu3 positions ( i.e. @xmath93 ) .",
    "let us firstly focus on the ground - state behavior .",
    "the most interesting finding to emerge here is that the ground - state magnetization depend on the field strength , whenever @xmath94 :    @xmath95 ^ 2 + 8 \\delta^2 } } \\biggr \\ } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ m_3 \\ ! \\ ! & = & \\ ! \\ ! - \\frac12 \\frac{1 + j_f / j_{af } + 2 \\mu_b b ( g_2 - g_3)/j_{af } }     { \\sqrt{[1 + j_f / j_{af } + 2 \\mu_b b ( g_2 - g_3)/j_{af}]^2 + 8 \\delta^2 } } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{m}{m_s } & = & \\frac{g_1 + g_2}{g_1 + 2 g_2 + g_3 }                  + \\frac{g_2 - g_3}{g_1 + 2 g_2 + g_3 } \\frac{1 + j_f / j_{af } + 2 \\mu_b b ( g_2 - g_3)/j_{af}}{\\sqrt{[1 + j_f / j_{af } + 2 \\mu_b b ( g_2 - g_3)/j_{af}]^2 + 8 \\delta^2}}. \\label{r13 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is quite apparent from eqs .",
    "( [ r13 ] ) that the field dependence of the total magnetization comes from the corresponding field variations of the on - site magnetization @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "another noticeable feature to observe here is that the magnetic field suppresses ( raises ) the quantum reduction of the magnetization @xmath69 and @xmath70 as far as @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "since the condition @xmath98 holds for most of the experimentally accessible fields and @xmath9-factors , the total magnetization should be nearly linearly dependent on the magnetic field with a linear term proportional to the difference @xmath99 .",
    "naturally , the greater the magnitude of the external field and @xmath100 , the stronger deviations from the linearity should emerge .",
    "some typical examples of the ground - state magnetization curves are depicted in fig .",
    "10 under the assumption @xmath101 ( fig .",
    "10a ) and @xmath102 ( fig.10b ) .",
    "these results can serve as evidence that the magnetization curve does not show an exact plateau , but rises steadily with the external field .",
    "it is also worthy to note that these `` magnetization plateaus with a finite slope '' ( when plotted in the full range with respect to the saturation magnetization , they are hardly discernible from the exact plateaus within the reasonable values of the @xmath9-factors ) do not occur precisely at half of the saturation magnetization ( @xmath103 ) , but they are shifted to higher values if @xmath101 ( fig .",
    "10a ) and respectively , to the smaller values if @xmath102 ( fig .",
    "10b ) .    to enable an independent check of the field dependence of the total magnetization ,",
    "the temperature variation of the susceptibility has been examined in detail .",
    "the typical thermal dependences of the susceptibility are plotted in fig .",
    "11 for @xmath104 and some selected external fields .",
    "generally , the susceptibility versus temperature plot can be characterized by a round maximum , which flattens and shifts to higher temperatures when increasing the external field .",
    "the low - temperature part of the susceptibility is displayed on an enlarged scale in the inset .",
    "it turns out that the susceptibility does not completely vanish as the temperature approaches zero ; nevertheless , it tends toward a small but finite value .",
    "this result provides a confirmation of the striking field - dependent magnetization and moreover , it also clearly demonstrates a gapless excitation spectrum above the ground state .      at this stage ,",
    "the results obtained from the exact mapping on the ising - heisenberg bac will be compared with the available experimental data for a single - crystal sample of the ccpa .",
    "it should be mentioned here that all the experimental data used in our further analysis have already been reported in earlier publications @xcite to which the interested reader is referred for more experimental details .    in order to fit the experimental data of the ccpa , we have to consider the six fitting parameters : the exchange constant @xmath105 , the exchange anisotropy @xmath23 , the alternation ratio @xmath83 and the three @xmath9-factors @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "note that the best fit of the magnetization and the susceptibility data obtained under the restriction of equal @xmath9-factors ( @xmath106 ) as well as isotropic exchange @xmath8 ( @xmath107 ) , have already been published by the present authors in our preliminary report ( see fig . 3 in ref . ) .",
    "unless specifically mentioned , the exchange anisotropy will again be fixed to the purely isotropic case @xmath107 , because the experimental measurements on the single - crystal sample do not reveal any significant spatial dependence : the spatial directions parallel and perpendicular to the chain axis seem to be almost equivalent .",
    "@xcite    in fig .",
    "12 , the low - temperature magnetization curve of ccpa measured in the pulsed ( fig . 12a ) and static ( fig .",
    "12b ) magnetic fields is compared with the relevant theoretical prediction ( the fitting parameters are indicated in the figures ) .",
    "it turns out , however , that the average @xmath9-factor must be approximately @xmath108 in order to get the correct saturation magnetization ( fig . 12a ) . even under this confinement ,",
    "several combinations of the @xmath9-factors provide almost the same fit to the experimental magnetization curve . for illustrative purposes",
    ", we choose the one with the smallest value of the @xmath10-factor to lower the susceptibility of the cu1 spins , because the most obvious discrepancies between the theory and the experiment emerge near zero field due to the more `` susceptible '' character of the ising spins , as already discussed earlier .",
    "unfortunately , it is beyond experimental verification to find out from the existing data set , whether the magnetization increase observed within the plateau region appears exclusively on account of the finite - temperature effect , or is partially caused by the inequality @xmath94 . although the former situation can not be definitely ruled out , it is rather more acceptable that there is at least a small contribution to the magnetization increase also from the difference between the @xmath9-factors .",
    "nonetheless , the final conclusion is complicated by different factors : the magnetization curves in the static fields ( fig .",
    "12b ) are measured at higher temperatures and become quite noisy above 15 t , while the available magnetization curve in the pulsed fields ( fig .",
    "12a ) show a relatively large hysteresis probably caused by the magnetocaloric effect .",
    "@xcite    the thermal dependence of the zero - field susceptibility times temperature data is illustrated in fig .",
    "13 . to obtain a reasonable accordance with the experimental measurement , slightly higher @xmath9-factors must be taken into consideration in comparison with the ones acquired by the fitting of the magnetization . despite this fact ,",
    "a quite impressive accordance can be achieved by rescaling the average @xmath9-factor at about 4 - 5% of its magnetization value @xmath109 .",
    "as expected , the most apparent disagreement appears in the descending tail of the @xmath87 curve nearby the zero temperature , where the susceptibility divergence is reminiscent of the ferromagnetic ising - type divergence rather than the heisenberg - type divergence .    finally , fig .",
    "14 shows the magnetic part of the specific heat as a function of the temperature for several magnetic fields .",
    "the corresponding theoretical predictions are also included ; nevertheless , the specific heat can merely be fitted with a rather unacceptable precision even though the results agree at least qualitatively . in order to situate the striking low - temperature peak around @xmath110 k , however ,",
    "a drastic reduction of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 exchange parameters was carried out . even under this condition ,",
    "the predicted peak is much more robust than observed experimentally and this feature remains valid also for any other combination of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 coupling constants .",
    "actually , the height of the low - temperature peak does not significantly vary with the ratio @xmath111 as already shown in fig .",
    "it is quite obvious that the inconsistency in the fitting set for the specific heat and , respectively , the magnetization and susceptibility , indicates some insufficiency in the considered model based on the simple concept of the f - f - af - af bac .",
    "notice that the basic problem that prevents obtaining an unique fitting set for all these quantities consists in reproducing the striking low - temperature peak of the specific heat , which can not be fitted within a reasonable accord neither under the assumption of the pure heisenberg f - f - af - af bac.@xcite a possible explanation for this peculiar inconsistency has recently been suggested by lu _",
    "@xcite , who found a strong indication that the striking low - temperature peak comes from the contribution of magnetic impurities . until a higher - quality sample of ccpa",
    "is prepared and remeasured , however , one can not exclude the other possibility that this anomalous peak originates from the neglected higher - order interaction terms in the proposed hamiltonian .",
    "our detailed analysis shows that neither the nonuniformity of @xmath9-factors nor the exchange anisotropy of the @xmath112 coupling constant , can resolve this inconsistency .",
    "in the present article , the magnetic properties of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg chain with regular f - f - af - af bond alternation have been investigated within the exact mapping transformation method .",
    "the results obtained from the mapping procedure are compared with the results of the corresponding heisenberg bac @xcite and with the experimental data of the ccpa compound , @xcite which is regarded to be an experimental realization of the spin-1/2 f - f - af - af bac .",
    "it should be emphasized that all characteristic quantum features observed in the spin-1/2 heisenberg f - f - af - af bac @xcite are still present also in our simplified ising - heisenberg version : one finds here a substantial quantum reduction of the ground - state magnetization @xmath69 and @xmath70 at the cu2 and cu3 sites in addition to the fully saturated ground - state magnetization @xmath71 at the cu1 site .",
    "perhaps , the most striking finding stemming from our study is that there appears a rather unusual change from the gapful to gapless excitation spectrum when converting the uniform @xmath9-factors at structurally non - equivalent positions to nonuniform ones . with regard to this ,",
    "the magnetization curve exhibits a real plateau under the condition @xmath113 only ; for any other case the magnetization within the quantum ferrimagnetic phase ( plateau state ) shows a weak field dependence .",
    "the success of the simplified ising - heisenberg model in reproducing the measured data for ccpa is also quite remarkable . with the exception of the specific heat ,",
    "where the results agree at the qualitative level only , other thermodynamic quantities are relatively well reproduced .",
    "in fact , small systematic errors occur merely in the low - temperature and weak - field region , where the approximation of the ferromagnetic coupling @xmath7 by the ising - type interaction plays the most essential role . it is worthwhile to mention , moreover ,",
    "that the discrepancy found in the specific heat fit can not be resolved even if a pure heisenberg f - f - af - af bac is considered . actually , very recent work of lu _",
    "et al._@xcite provided a strong indication that the striking low - temperature peak of specific heat is being of extrinsic origin probably caused by the presence of magnetic impurities .",
    "however , further experimental measurements with high - quality samples of ccpa are required to clarify this issue .",
    "finally , one should notice that the simple concept of the ising - heisenberg f - f - af - af bac presented here can be rather straightforwardly extended to account for second - neighbor interactions , the antisymetric dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction , and/or multispin interactions , which can not be ruled out as a potential cause of the observed discrepancies until the influence of magnetic impurities will experimentally be confirmed .",
