    "in recent years majorana zero modes have been in the focus of research in condensed matter physics.@xcite experimental signatures of majorana zero modes have been observed in the tunnelling conductance in hybrid superconductor - semiconductor nanowire systems.@xcite however , an unambiguous identification of majorana particles remains open.@xcite very recently an important step  @xcite towards such an identification was taken by scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments on ferromagnetic atomic chains on a superconductor , which allowed to obtain spatially resolved signatures showing localization of the zero modes at the edges as predicted by theory .",

    "this model possesses a topological phase with two - fold degenerate ground states which can not be distinguished by any local order parameter .",
    "there exist zero - energy modes that commute with the hamiltonian and anticommute with the fermionic parity ; these are the majorana zero modes .",
    "they are exponentially localized near the boundaries . as is well - known ( see e.g. ref .  ) the kitaev chain can be mapped to the one - dimensional transverse - field ising chain via a non - local jordan  wigner transformation . in the resulting spin variables",
    ", the topological phase reduces to the ordered phase showing spontaneous magnetization while the fermionic parity maps to a string of spin operators .",
    "the recent surge of interest in condensed - matter realizations of majorana fermions includes the investigation of the effects of disorder  @xcite or dimerization  @xcite on the topological phase , the study of nanostructures possessing majorana zero modes,@xcite and strongly correlated systems showing kondo physics.@xcite furthermore , generalizations to higher symmetries including supersymmetry  @xcite and parafermion modes were analyzed.@xcite    here we focus on interaction effects .",
    "motivated by the proposal  @xcite to realize systems hosting majorana zero modes in semiconducting nanowires and the subsequent experimental works,@xcite most previous studies of interaction effects have focused on nanowire setups . this included the original spinful nanowire system with spin - orbit coupling , a zeeman field and proximity to a superconductor,@xcite similar multi - band nanowires,@xcite and effectively spinless systems  @xcite including helical wires  @xcite and two - chain ladders.@xcite furthermore , interactions directly in the kitaev chain were studied,@xcite which were also shown to be implementable in an array of josephson junctions,@xcite a realization allowing to reach strong interaction strengths as well as good control of the parameters . from all these",
    "works a physical picture emerged revealing two main effects of interactions : on the one hand , interactions suppress the bulk gap and thus decrease the stability of the topological phase , while on the other hand , repulsive interactions broaden the chemical - potential window over which majorana zero modes exist . which of these two effects dominates or is more relevant depends on the specific realization at hand .",
