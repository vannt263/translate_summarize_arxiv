    "these parameters can then be used to estimate the degree of entanglement for the two - qubit system as a function of gate charge , although such an inference does not in itself constitute a direct observation of the entangled state , as can be established using state tomography.@xcite    we also present the multiplexed quantum capacitance measurement ( qcm ) , which is an effective method for probing the state of multiple qubits with a single rf line . in a single qubit ,",
    "the qcm is a dispersive measurement of the reactive response of an lc oscillator coupled capacitively to the qubit island.@xcite the capacitance of the qubit has , in addition to its geometric capacitance , a term which is determined by the second derivative of the qubit energy with respect to the gate charge , so that the overall capacitance of the oscillator depends on the qubit state .",

    "this higher q value is due to very small coupling capacitances between the lc oscillators and the 50  @xmath15 transmission line .",
    "this results in a larger phase - shift of the reflected signal for a given quantum capacitance , thus permitting a more sensitive measurement and allowing the use of a smaller rf gate capacitor .",
    "this reduces the noise coupled from the rf line onto the qubit , as does the filtering effect of a high q oscillator .",
    "furthermore , a higher q oscillator permits closer frequency spacing of the two oscillators , so that both resonances can fit within the 50 mhz bandwidth of the cold circulator .",
    "when the oscillators are monitored with rf reflectometry , the loss of signal bandwidth associated with a high q oscillator limits the effectiveness of this circuit for short - pulse or single - shot readout .",

    ", there is minimal intrinsic loss and the quality factor is set simply by the coupling capacitance to the 50 @xmath15 transmission line .",
    "however , in direct measurements of the linear response of the tank circuit as a function of temperature and magnetic field , we represent the intrinsic losses of the tank circuit at the resonance frequency with a series resistance of 1 @xmath15 in devices fabricated on single - crystal quartz substrates .",
    "this value of the resistance was determined by fitting the tank circuit response to a lumped - element model .",
    "the series resistance manifests itself as a decreased amplitude and complex offset in the observed signal , which must be carefully accounted for when processing the data .    for an applied rf power of -130 dbm ,",
    "the current in the inductor is 0.4 na , and this anomalous resistance corresponds to a power dissipation of roughly -160 dbm in the inductor .",
    "measurements of the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the resonant response of similar tank circuits were consistent with predictions of a standard two - fluid model for the kinetic inductance and surface resistance of the superconducting trilayer .",
    "however , at low temperature and zero field , this model predicts negligible dissipation , so this series resistance can not simply be ascribed to the ac surface resistance of the superconducting trilayer .",
    "furthermore , an all - aluminum tank circuit fabricated with electron - beam lithography shows comparable losses .    likewise ,",
    "a straightforward estimate of the power dissipated into eddy currents in the au - plated cu sample box yields a dissipated power of -200 dbm , which is not enough to explain the loss .",
    "another possible dissipation mechanism is electromagnetic loss in the substrate .",
    "finite - element simulations predicted a small dissipative component in the resonant response given a material loss tangent typical of single - crystal quartz , but zero dissipation when given a loss tangent typical of sapphire .",
    "similar devices fabricated on polished r - plane sapphire had an inductor series resistance of @xmath41 .",
    "however , the high dielectric constant of sapphire required a complete tank circuit redesign , with significantly less on - chip metal , so it is difficult to say with certainty whether the improvement is attributable to the improved loss characteristics of the substrate alone .",

    "such a signal is typically referred to as  1e - periodic \" .",

    "<S> we characterize a pair of cooper - pair boxes coupled with a fixed capacitor using spectroscopy and measurements of the ground - state quantum capacitance . </S>",
    "<S> we use the extracted parameters to estimate the concurrence , or degree of entanglement between the two qubits . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a thorough demonstration of a multiplexed quantum capacitance measurement technique , which is in principle scalable to a large array of superconducting qubits . </S>"
