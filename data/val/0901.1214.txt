    "one of the most challenging goals of the future space missions is to detect life on extrasolar planets .",
    "these missions are designed to image a planet as a single dot floating beside its parent star , using high - contrast imaging techniques .",
    "photons from the unresolved planet will feed a low - resolution spectrograph and give first insights into planet s chemistry .",
    "recent works suggest that earth s vegetation is detectable in the earth integrated spectrum at visible wavelengths @xcite , assuming extraterrestrial plants , if they exist , are similar to earth s plants .",
    "our green vegetation indeed has a reflectance spectrum showing a sharp increase - the so - called vegetation red edge ( vre ) - around @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ vegetation ] ) that could be considered as a possible global biomarker .",
    "a question arising from these results is whether vegetation was also detectable when the ( early ) earth looked significantly different than today . in other words ,",
    "if an earth - like planet with a climate different from the modern earth s climate is detected one day , will we be able to detect vegetation on it ? to answer this , we investigate the vegetation spectral detectability during the last quaternary climatic extrema , for which past climate simulations have been made by general circulation models ( gcms ) .",
    "this simulated climate is used as a driver for an equilibrium vegetation model , providing biome maps of the earth at these epochs .",
    "the last glacial maximum ( lgm ) occurred about 21 kyr ( kilo - year ) ago .",
    "temperatures globally of the order of @xmath1 colder than today @xcite were responsible for a large extent of sea and continental ice sheets , especially in the northern hemisphere .",
    "sea level was also significantly lower ( @xmath2 m @xcite ) resulting in larger emerged lands .    during the holocene optimum ( 6 kyr before present , hereafter kyrbp ) ,",
    "earth s northern hemisphere was @xmath3 warmer than today @xcite .",
    "the sea level was rising , although still slightly lower than today , because the amount of water released from continental ice was partially compensated by an isostatic response of the continents , _",
    "i.e. _ a rise of the continents following the deglaciation of the northern hemisphere .",
    "the sahara was more vegetated than today @xcite , its desertification being the main large - scale change in land cover for the last 6000 years @xcite .    here , based on a combination of biomes and simulated cloud cover maps for the periods mentioned above ,",
    "associated with 300 to 800 nm spectra for each biome and cloud , we build earth integrated spectra , for given earth phases and observer positions .",
    "the vegetation spectral signature is then extracted from these spectra .",
    "the first part of the paper describes the model of the earth from which we derive global reflectance spectra .",
    "the second part of the paper discusses the results .",
    "note that some results showing the rotating earth and corresponding instantaneous spectrum are available on - line as animated gif files ( http://www.obs-hp.fr/@xmath4arnold/results/2009_ijastrobio/vre.html ) .     at @xmath5",

    "the equilibrium terrestrial biosphere model biome3 @xcite is a process based vegetation model simulating biogeography and biogeochemistry .",
    "model inputs consist of monthly climate variables ( temperature , precipitation , and sunshine ) data , minimum annual temperature and atmospheric co2 concentration .",
    "a coupled hydrological model calculates moisture availability on the basis of a soil texture class .",
    "the model simulates the productivity and cover ( leaf area index ) of a set of plant functional types .",
    "the comparative dominance of these types is then used to estimate the dominant biome for a given grid cell .",
    "a total of 24 biomes may be simulated , including barren ground and snow / ice cover ( fig .",
    "[ biomes_legend ] and [ biomes_maps ] ) .",
    "the model was run for the three periods of interest : modern , holocene optimum and lgm earth ( fig . [ biomes_legend ] and [ biomes_maps ] ) .",
    "for the modern period , gridded climate data on a 0.5 grid was taken from @xcite , and atmospheric co2 concentration was set to a pre - industrial level of 280 ppm .",
    "for the two past periods , climate data was obtained from simulations run for under the paleoclimate modelling intercomparison project .",
    "we used data from the uk meteorological office general circulation model ( ukmo gcm ) , run under climatic forcings for these two periods @xcite .",
    "the gcm output was downscaled to the same resolution grid as the modern period by calculating anomalies for each past period .",
    "the gcm control run value was subtracted from the past value for each gcm grid point , and then these anomalies were added to the modern climatology grid points .",
    "atmospheric co2 concentration was set to 265 ppm and 180 ppm for the holocene optimum and lgm respectively .",
    "the results obtained agree well with observational evidence of past vegetation change @xcite .",
    "the mid - holocene is dominated by a greening of the sahara , and a poleward shift of the high latitude treelines .",
    "the lgm is characterised by a large expansion of steppe and grassland vegetation at mid - latitudes , with a near disappearance of temperate forest .",
    "there is also the fragmentation of tropical forest and widespread expansion of tundra vegetation at high latitudes .",
    "there are , however , some disagreements with the data , for example the expansion of grassland in australia .",
    "+   +      we used a collection of gome spectra taken the 18 , 19 and 20th of may 1999 , corresponding to springtime and the middle of the greenup period in the northern hemisphere . in may",
    "the average ndvi ( normalized differential vegetation index ) is just half of its maximum value reached in july .",
    "sun declination is @xmath8 for the observing dates in may .",
    "it is fall in the southern hemisphere and the polar night is present at latitudes below @xmath9 .",
    "the gome spectra are reflectances obtained from the ratio of a given ground pixel radiance @xmath10 over solar irradiance @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the solar zenit angle .",
    "a reference spectra for each biome @xmath14 is extracted from the gome data ( fig .",
    "[ gome_spectra ] ) . in order to find a given biome spectrum with minimal cloud contamination",
    ", the algorithm choses the spectrum with the lowest signal in the interval 450 to 500 nm , considering that the signal in this spectral range rapidly increases with the presence of clouds .",
    "this algorithm fails for three types of surfaces : ocean , snow / ice and cloud .",
    "these spectra are chosen by hand.    it must also be noted that this algorithm chooses the most vegetated pixel for a given biome : if a cloudless pixel is a mixture of sand and vegetation , it will be ignored in favor of a pixel with more vegetation , which will display a lowest signal in the spectral interval mentioned .",
    "this suggests that the reference pixel ( and spectrum ) for each biome is probably biased toward the most vegetated pixel of a given biome area .",
    "lastly , since it is spring in the northern hemisphere and fall in the southern hemisphere , the reference spectrum for the biomes of deciduous species will be preferentially picked up in the greener northern hemisphere .",
    "therefore , our simulations will be more relevant for reconstruction of the northern hemisphere rather of the southern hemisphere , with a probable overestimate of the vegetation signal if the southern hemisphere is mainly in view .     for the biome legend .",
    "note that all plots do not have the same vertical scale . , width=472 ]        to build a realistic earth s spectrum , we need both the cloud cover map and the reflectance map of that cloud cover , @xmath15 .",
    "we used cloud covers from the international satellite cloud climatology project ( isccp ) .",
    "we selected only data for the month of may from the 1999 to 2004 vis - ir observations , to be consistent with the gome spectra .",
    "since low , middle and high altitude clouds have different typical optical depth and reflectances , we build the cloud cover reflectance @xmath15 from the sum of the three different altitudes cloud cover maps @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , weighted by their albedo , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively 0.69 , 0.48 and 0.21 @xcite , and normalized to the albedo of low altitude clouds @xmath19 , i.e.    @xmath22    the result from this formula is that the three different types of clouds contribute to a given pixel s reflectance proportionally to their cover over that pixel .",
    "the formula also can lead to a few pixels with reflectance above 1 , which are then simply clipped to 1 .",
    "the obtained map ( fig .",
    "[ cc_ref_isccp ] ) is normalized to the albedo of low clouds for which we have a reference spectrum from the gome data .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     the reconstructed scenes of the earth , from which the results below are extracted , have been made using a sun declination of @xmath23 , corresponding to the earth - sun configuration for may .",
    "the earth phase viewed by the observer is reconstructed for several inclination @xmath24 .",
    "the angle @xmath25 is the orbital phase of the earth viewed from the location of the observer : @xmath26 is for western maximum elongation , @xmath27 for superior conjunction , @xmath28 for eastern elongation and @xmath29 for inferior conjunction .    in table",
    "[ vre_albedo ] , the vre and albedo values obtained from the model are given for the different periods .",
    "for the modern earth , the albedo values obtained with the isccp data are higher than with biome3.5 , due to a lower cloud cover with biome3.5 , leading to a lower vre .",
    "this suggests that the biome3.5 model probably overestimates the vre",
    ". nevertheless , relative comparisons between biome3.5 results remain consistent although the absolute values may be overestimated .",
    "the main result from this study is that the climate differences between the quaternary extrema and the modern earth s climate have little impacts on the vegetation signal , since the spectral signature of vegetation is not washed out during the lgm and does not increase very much during the holocene optimum .",
    "there are nevertheless interesting differences in vegetation visibility between these two extrema and the situation today , depending of the observer s position : when the northern hemisphere is mainly in view , vegetation is indeed more visible during the holocene optimum as shown in fig .",
    "[ vre-24h - variation_nord ] and table [ vre_albedo ] : the vre was typically 6% , thus higher than today ( 5% ) or during the lgm ( 4% ) .",
    "this is mainly due to a greener sahara as shown in fig .",
    "[ vre-24h - variation_nord](a ) .",
    "this is true for an observer with mostly the northern hemisphere in view , i.e. inclination @xmath30 . in inferior conjunction configuration",
    ", the crescent - shaped earth mainly shows its northern part .",
    "there are no significant differences between modern and holocene earths ( vre @xmath31 ) and vegetation becomes almost undetectable for the earth with the lgm large polar ice cap ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "if the observer is above the northern pole ( observing from ecliptic north pole ) with in view a half - illuminated earth , there are again no significant differences between modern and holocene earths ( vre @xmath33 ) . however , as the north pole ice is much more extended during the lgm , the signal of the vegetation is significantly weaker ( only 2% ) , due to the higher reflectance of a larger polar zone and the consequently smaller vegetated areas is view .    the three bottom lines from table [ vre_albedo ] give results for earth views in which southern hemisphere contribution is high , with inclination @xmath24 ranging from 90 to @xmath34 .",
    "as pointed out in section [ sect_biome_spectra ] , our model probably overestimates the vre values of scenes with the southern hemisphere mostly in view as our calibration was made during fall time ( may ) in that hemisphere and deciduous species should have a lower vre than with the spectra used in the simulation that have been collected in the northern hemisphere .",
    "nevertheless , there are two trends to be mentioned : the first one is that the difference between holocene and modern period becomes negligible , because the sahara contribution decreases or even vanishes from these southern view points .",
    "the second remark is that , paradoxically , the southern hemisphere vre during the lgm is higher : this is induced by a greener australia during the lgm , as we obtained a simulated wider distribution of temperate grassland and less desert in australia using the biome3.5 model ( fig .",
    "[ biomes_maps ] ) at the holocene optimum . as",
    "discussed above , this does not agree with observations of past vegetation and may arise from an incorrectly simulated climate over this region .",
    "figures [ earth_scenes_spectra_45 ] and [ earth_scenes_spectra_45_biome35 ] finally show modern earth s scenes with corresponding spectrum obtained following the method described in sect .",
    "[ method ] . in fig .",
    "[ earth_scenes_spectra_45 ] , we show the spectrum for central longitudes of @xmath35 ( africa and europe ) and @xmath36 ( northern pacific ocean and alaska ) at which the model gives the maximum and minimum vre , respectively of 8.1 and 1.5% . fig .",

    "will next space observatories be able to detect vre - like features in an earth - like planet spectrum ?",
    "the terrestrial planet finder coronagraph mission ( tpf - c ) is aimed to make the direct detection and the characterization ( multi - spectral imaging at resolution up to 70 ) of nearby terrestrial extrasolar planets in the visible range .",
    "the telescope would have an elliptical aperture of @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "an earth - like planet in the habitable zone is @xmath38 fainter than its parent star , making such planets very faint objects in the v=28 to 31 range . according to @xcite , exposure time of the order of one day",
    "will be needed to detect them and spectral characterization will add weeks of additional integration time per target. more quantitatively , in a comparison of different types of coronagraphs @xcite , the authors conclude that an earth - like planet at about 10 pc could be detected in 2.3 h with a signal - to - noise ratio of snr=7 with a 100 nm bandwidth from 0.5 to @xmath39 with a 4-m telescope , and even in 14 minutes with a 6-m telescope , both equipped with one of best performers of the comparison , a phase - induced amplitude apodisation coronagraph . now if we want to be able to detect a 4% vre - like feature in a spectrum at a resolution of 70 around 700 nm , the snr should be about 80 for a 3-sigma detection , or 125 for a 5-sigma detection . with the 4-m coronagraphic telescope metioned above , the total exposure time becomes vey long , 18 and 44 weeks for 3 and 5-sigma detection , respectively .",
    "this in agreement with the order of magnitude given by @xcite . with a 6-m telscope",
    ", the total exposure times decrease to 13 days and one month , respectively .",
    "if a larger telescope than the tpf - c - like telescopes mentioned above is considered , the exposure time will decrease again . according to @xcite , a planet",
    "could be detected in 2 minutes with a 12-m telescope .",
    "the total exposure times to detect a 4% feature in a spectrum would then decrease to 2 and 5 days , for 3 and 5-sigma detection , respectively .",
    "these very long exposure times suggest that features of a few percents will be extremely difficult to detect , maybe even not within reach of a first - generation 4-m tpf .",
    "a 6-m telescope seems to be the minimum to envisage the detection of seasonal variations . with exposure times of 2 to 5 days",
    ", a 12-m telescope would probably not freeze the rotation of the planet and rather give an integrated spectrum of the planet over several rotations , but atmospheric changes at times scales of the order of a week or longer would be possible to detect and follow up , as well as longer seasonal variations .    unfortunately tpf - c might not fly before 2025 , and in the meantime , a smaller instrument could look for bigger and closer terrestrial planets : a 2-m class space coronagraph like see - coast could indeed detect a vre on super - earths closer than 3 to 6 pc @xcite , depending on their radius whose maximum value is presently unclear .",
    "these super - earths are as well habitable than earth - sized planets .",
    "more ambitious instruments that might fly later this century will allow us to make a step furthermore in the characterization of these planets and the observation of exo - vegetation. hypertelescopes in space - interferometric sparse arrays of small telescopes - will indeed allow us to see earth - like planets as _",
    "small resolved disks _ several resels across @xcite and this clearly will help us to detect photosynthetic life on these planets !",
    "for example , a 150-km hypertelescope would provide 40 resolution elements ( resels ) across an earth at 3 pc in yellow light @xcite . and",
    "a formation of 150 3-m mirrors would collect enough photons in 30-min to freeze the rotation of the planet and produce an image with at least @xmath40 resels , and up to thousands depending on array geometry ( fig .",

    "in order to mimic an earth - like extrasolar planet observed without spatial resolution , i.e. as a single dot , in a different climate state than our contemporary earth , we considered the earth during the last climatic extrema , 6 and 21 kyr ago , and studied the vegetation spectral signature integrated over the full illuminated phase seen by the observer .",
    "the results presented in this paper suggest that vegetation disk - averaged signature remained visible in earth spectra during these climatic extrema , with vre values close to those for the modern earth .",
    "our discussion emphasized some differences induced for example by the greener sahara during the holocene optimum , or by the large northern ice cap during the lgm .",
    "results would probably benefit in accuracy from radiative transfer calculations , an implementation of the sun glint effect and the brdfs of all scattering surfaces included in the model .",
    "the spectra would thence also display a more accurate rayleigh scattering slope and absorption bands depth .",
    "further , improved gcm estimates for these past periods are now available , including coupled ocean - atmosphere simulations @xcite , as well as dynamic vegetation models @xcite , both of which may help improve the past vegetation distributions obtained here .",
    "all these improvements could be considered for future developments .    of course a next step in this work",
    "could also be the consideration of the earth at much older epochs , when continents had a very different shape than today and climates maybe much more extreme than those considered in this work , although paleoclimatic models are probably less confident for these epochs .",
    "it would although probably provide us with relevant illustrations of earth spectrum variability over one full day , and related vre variations .",
    "current climate change , thence biome maps for the end of this century , might also tell us if vegetation will remain a detectable biomarker for observers out there .",
