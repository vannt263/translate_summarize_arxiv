    "from the early development of modified ( higher order ) gravity models @xcite , their dynamical equivalence to different representations has been an issue of research and intense debate .",
    "what the term  dynamical equivalence \" means is that a particular gravitational action can be re - expressed as a new one , with a new set of field variables , and that there is an invertible mapping that relates the two sets of field variables , as well as the two actions ( or lagrangians ) respectively .",
    "the variational principle of the new action will in principle require different boundary conditions and possibly different gibbons  hawking terms as well .",
    "probably the most well known example of such an equivalence is that of the @xmath0 action to brans ",
    "dicke and einstein ",
    "hilbert one , the first through the introduction of an auxiliary scalar field @xcite@xcite , and the second through a conformal transformation of the metric , @xcite.    the motivation of re - expressing a gravitational action by introducing a new set of field variables might be related mainly to two things .",
    "the first is mathematical simplicity and convenience , if the new set of variables is to make the calculations one wants to perform simpler .",
    "furthermore , if one is able to move from a variational principle that will lead to fourth order equations of motion to another that will lead to second order ones , that could be a benefit , since second order equations are in principle easier to handle as well as to interpret physically . the second possible motivation is related to physics .",
    "one gets more intuition and understanding of a gravitational theory , by studying its equivalence to other ones ( like the equivalence between @xmath0 and einstein gravity ) .    from a physical point of view care",
    "must be taken in the interpretation of physical quantities in the two different representations .",
    "the question that often arises is which of the two representations is the physical one .",
    "for example , in the case of the conformal equivalence between @xmath0 and einstein gravity , the inclusion of matter in the action can raise the question of along which of the two metrics ( original and conformally transformed one ) do matter particles actually fall . for",
    "some interesting discussions on the subject one can refer to refs @xcite@xcite .",
    "given the equivalence between the bulk parts of two actions , this does not mean that the equivalence holds for the surface parts as well . more precisely , given the gh term of an action in one representation , then the gh term calculated using the equivalence with the other reresentation is possible to be problematic as far as the particular variational principle is concerned . as we will discuss later on ,",
    "this is the case for @xmath0 and @xmath1 gravity , when the equivalence between the original and the jordan frame action is considered . as we will see , the latter equivalence breaks on the boundary surface .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on @xmath0 and @xmath3 models , where @xmath2 is the gauss  bonnet ( gb ) term defined as @xcite @xmath4 @xmath5 being an in principle non linear function of its arguments .",
    "we will study the dynamical equivalence of above theories to other representations in vacuum , using as our main tool the rather general approach of legendre transformation , which for the case of @xmath0 coincides with the standard procedure of introducing an auxiliary scalar field followed by a conformal transformation , something which is not true for @xmath3 theories , i.e. the latter can not be conformally transformed to a minimally coupled , scalar - tensor frame .",
    "however , for the @xmath3 theory , we will show how using a legendre transformation we can re - express it as a second order theory , with a new extra rank two tensor field .",
    "we will work at the level of the action and we will include in our analysis the relevant gibbons  hawking terms , which are important for the consistency of the initial value formulation of the theory .",
    "furthermore , we will calculate them explicitly wherever necessary .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ lagrangianformulation ] we briefly describe the approach of legendre transforming a higher order gravitational action . in view of the latter approach ,",
    "in section [ f(r)1 ] we show the equivalence of the full ( including the relevant gh term ) @xmath0 action to the einstein ",
    "hilbert one .",
    "we also discuss the equivalence between the relevant gh terms .",
    "then , in section [ f(g)1 ] we consider the @xmath3 action and after calculating the gh term in the jordan ( scalar  tensor ) frame , we explicitly study the effect of conformal transformation on the full jordan frame action .",
    "finally , in section [ f(g)2 ] we re - express the original @xmath3 action with one scalar and two extra tensor fields present ( apart from the metric ) , one of them though being independent , and then discuss the classical dynamics of the system .",
    "useful formulas and calculations can be found in the appendix .",
    "we will work in natural units , @xmath6 .",
    "in this section we will briefly describe the idea and motivation behind legendre transforming a gravitational action as a tool of moving to a new , dynamically equivalent variational principle of second - order , first applied in refs @xcite .",
    "the higher order nature of non  linear gravitational lagrangians like the @xmath0 or @xmath3 ones , comes from the fact that they are non  linear with respect to the second derivatives of the metric , since  @xmath7 \" is an in principle non  linear function with respect to its arguments , and @xmath8",
    ".    however , we can try to re  express higher order gravitational lagrangians linearly with respect to @xmath9 , by making them linear with respect to the curvature tensors .",
    "] through the introduction of the appropriate  velocities \" and  momenta \" , in a similar fashion to the ordinary hamiltonian formalism .",
    "the new variational principle will then lead to second order equations of motion for the new set of field variables .    the appropriate identification for the generalised  position \" and  moment \" as well as",
    "the legendre transformed lagrangian will read schematically as @xmath10 ^-1/2 = _ ip_i - _ ip_i - h(q , p ) , assuming the invertibility condition holds , @xmath11 .",
    "quantities entering @xmath12 will be in principle tensor objects .",
    "different gravity actions give us different options in defining generalised  velocities \" and  momenta \" .",
    "this will be made clear in sections [ f(r)2 ] and [ f(g)2 ] , where we will apply the above formalism for the case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 gravity respectively .",
    "it is well known in the literature that through the introduction of an auxiliary scalar , the @xmath0 action can be re - expressed as a non  minimally coupled scalar - tensor one ( also called jordan frame action ) , and it is the latter that is usually conformally transformed to the so - called einstein frame action . in this section ,",
    "we we will focus and attempt to clarify the role of the relevant gh terms in the two representations , original and jordan frame one . then , in the next subsection we will demonstrate the equivalence of the full action ( bulk and surface part ) using the general approach of the legendre transformation .",
    "starting from the bulk @xmath0 action on a manifold @xmath13 , s = f(r ) , [ f(r)_action ] through the introduction of an auxiliary scalar @xmath14 , one can re - express it in a dynamically equivalent way as s^j = , [ f(r)hj ] with @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "for the latter we require that @xmath17 , so we are able to solve for @xmath18 .",
    "action ( [ f(r)hj ] ) is the so - called jordan frame action .",
    "the transition to the einstein frame action will be shown explicitly in section [ f(r)2 ] by means of a legendre transformation .",
    "when considering gravitational actions on manifolds with boundary @xmath19 , the variation gives boundary terms containing normal derivatives of the metric variation @xmath20 .",
    "however , a well defined variational principle requires that only a particular set of dynamical coordinates ( @xmath21 and possibly its derivatives up to some order depending on the theory ) is fixed on the boundary . in order to cancel the extra , unwanted surface terms",
    ", one needs to add a so - called gibbons - hawking ( gh ) term in the action .",
    "the appropriate modification of the einstein - hilbert action turns out to be @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the induced metric on the surface @xmath19 , and @xmath24 is the trace of its extrinsic curvature",
    ". variation of ( [ gr_gh ] ) is then performed keeping only the metric @xmath25 fixed on the boundary .",
    "in the original @xmath0 action ( [ f(r)_action ] ) there is no natural gh term which cancels the extra unwanted higher derivative boundary terms , except for the particular case of maximally symmetric spacetimes @xcite .",
    "however , in the jordan frame of @xmath0 one can find an appropriate gibbons  hawking term in full generality , and then under the assumption that the dynamical equivalence between different representations holds on the boundary surface , one is able to re - express it in the original @xmath0 representation .",
    "let us examine this more carefully .",
    "first we want to find the gh term in the jordan frame , and so we vary ( [ f(r)hj ] ) with respect to the bulk metric and after discarding the bulk contributions we get @xmath26 therefore , the gh term that should be added in the jordan frame action ( [ f(r)gh ] ) is @xmath27 and variation should be performed with ( @xmath28 ) vanishing on @xmath19 . after using the correspondence between jordan and original frame , @xmath29",
    ", we find the gh term in the original frame to be representation by substituting the equation of motion for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , into eq .",
    "( [ hj_gh ] ) .",
    "this makes clear that the equivalence is demonstrably valid only on - shell ( i.e. at the level of the classical equations of motion ) . ]",
    "@xmath32 however , variation of this boundary term generates a new term @xmath33 which vanishes only by requiring that @xmath34 on the boundary . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the gh term ( [ f(r)gh ] ) is necessary in order to derive the correct wald entropy for @xmath0 gravity . however , keeping @xmath35 fixed on the boundary surface can be problematic .",
    "since r includes both the first and the second derivatives of the metric , keeping it fixed would in principle require that the second derivatives of the metric are held fixed too , which overconstrains the actual formulation . the only possibility that would prevent the latter from happening",
    "would be that the condition @xmath34 is satisfied through some special configuration of the field variations on the boundary , something that would restrict the generality of our variational principle .",
    "therefore , we see that equivalence between the two representations breaks down at the boundary , when the consistency of the variational principle is considered .",
    "this failure indicates that the two theories can not be truly equivalent .",
    "furthermore , the two theories are inequivalent at the quantum level as well ; considering the path integral defined in the jordan frame , the integration over @xmath30 , will generate extra terms in the effective action , making the latter inequivalent to the one defined in the original representation .",
    "we now want to exploit the dynamical equivalence between the full @xmath0 and einstein  hilbert action , using solely the legendre transformation approach , presented in section [ lagrangianformulation ] , which is more general and for the @xmath0 case gives the same result with the conformal transformation .",
    "this was done in ref .",
    "@xcite for the bulk lagrangian , discarding a total derivative . in the following",
    "we will show how to cure this by legendre transforming the gh term , apart from the bulk part , getting this way the correct einstein ",
    "hilbert gh term as well .",
    "let us begin with the action s = f(r ) + f(r)k , including the gh term found in the previous section ) can be in general problematic , however it turns to be neccessary here in order to cancel extra surface terms after legendre transforming the action . ] . as we will see below , the inclusion of the latter is indeed a good choice .",
    "we will need separate variables for the boundary surface , and the legendre transfomed action will be of the form = ( _ bp_b - h_b ) + ( _ p _ - h _ ) , [ f(r)helmholtzaction ] with @xmath36 . let us first naively associate for the generalised bulk velocity , @xmath37 .",
    "then we get the bulk conjugate momentum as p_b(q , ) ^ = f(r ) g^. [ f(r)conjugatemomentum0 ] we see that the definition of the conjugate momentum defines a conformal relation between two different metrics .",
    "in fact , as we will see below , @xmath38 is the metric in the einstein frame .",
    "however , the correct association for @xmath39 is not exactly @xmath40 , but @xmath35 , since relation ( [ f(r)conjugatemomentum0 ] ) can not be inverted for @xmath40 .",
    "we proceed by identifying _",
    "b r , _ k , [ f(r)associations ] @xmath41 now , using the intuition gained from ( [ f(r)conjugatemomentum0 ] ) , and using ( [ f(r)bulkconjugatemomentum])-([f(r)surfconjugatemomentum ] ) , we define the following relations for the bulk and surface metric respectively ^ ^g^ ^ ^h^.    the invertibility condition is not satisfied on the boundary @xmath19 , since @xmath42 . however , the surface part of @xmath43 can be still defined , with the only difference that the surface hamiltonian will vanish identically , @xmath44 .",
    "the bulk hamiltonian is calculated after solving one of relations ( [ f(r)bulkconjugatemomentum ] ) for @xmath35 , @xmath45 . using this together with ( [ f(r)associations])-([f(r)surfconjugatemomentum ] ) , and substituting in ( [ f(r)helmholtzaction ] ) we arrive at    = + k.

    "however , the gh terms found through this procedure turn out to render the variational principle inconsistent .",
    "this is due to the fact that the two representations are not equivalent at the quantum level , as pointed out in section [ f(r)1.1 ] .    due to the structural simplicity of the full @xmath0 action , the legendre transformation yields in this case the same result as a conformal transformation of the original action . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath1 jordan ( non  minimally coupled ) frame action can not be re - expressed as a second order theory through a conformal transformation , despite the fact that the auxiliary scalar decouples from the gauss  bonnet term for @xmath133 .",
    "the resulting theory is still of fourth  order , as was calculated explicitly for the full action in section [ f(g)1 ] .",
