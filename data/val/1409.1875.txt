    "the major goal of physics is the quest for understanding and controlling the forces of nature . in recent decades",
    "physicists and chemists have begun to invent increasingly creative ways to combine the fundamental forces and to generate new , effective interactions on microscopic and macroscopic scales .",
    "cold atoms could not be trapped and cooled @xcite , colloidal suspensions would become unstable and flocculate @xcite , and magnetic levitation would be impossible @xcite if combined , effective interactions were absent .",
    "as we know from condensed matter physics , the interplay of attractive and repulsive forces of different origins can give rise to highly complex structures .",
    "they range from gyroid phases in block copolymers @xcite , labyrinthine phases in ferrofluids @xcite to nuclear pasta phases in neutron stars @xcite to name only a few .",
    "not surprisingly , adding more physical interactions naturally increases the structural complexity of the resulting materials .",
    "here we ask the opposite question : how much complexity can emerge from a _ single _ , simple to generate , effective interaction ?    in the recent short paper @xcite we studied , the probably simplest _ effective interaction _ able to generate surprisingly complex structures .",
    "this effective interaction appears , for instance , between dipolar magnetic ( or dielectric ) particles when a spatially uniform , isotropic but time varying magnetic ( or electric ) field is externally applied ( cf .",
    "the first instance of it was described in a series of important papers by martin et al .",
    "@xcite in a system of superparamagnetic colloids in _ balanced _ _ triaxial magnetic fields _ ( btmf ) _  _ - rotating magnetic fields spinning on a cone with the magic opening angle @xmath2 .",
    "the emerging effective interaction between two colloids appeared to be , at the first glance , reminiscent of the london - van der waals force @xcite . yet",
    "the structures formed , including colloidal membranes and foams , were unexpectedly more intricate and differing strongly from those expected in classical van der waals ( vdw ) systems .",
    "inspired by the fascinating magnetic colloid superstructures generated experimentally @xcite we have begun to systematically investigate the physical ingredients and the consequences of the induced interaction @xcite . by starting out from the analogy with the vdw interaction we have considered a generalization of martin s btmf field structure @xcite and arrived at the concept of the _ spatially coherent van der waals _ ( cvdw ) interaction , see fig.1b @xcite .    in the previous short and rather dense paper @xcite",
    ", we have answered the important question , why cvdw generates complex structures like chains , membranes and foams while its sister - the van der waals - like _ incoherent fluctuation interaction _ ( vdw ) ",
    "see fig.1a , merely forms phase - separated lumps or 3d droplets of matter within a two phase system @xcite .",
    "however , many details and numerous subtle questions were omitted in @xcite due to the lack of space . in the following we close the gap and",
    "present a fairly complete theory of cvdw .     as a new item going much beyond the previous letter @xcite",
    ", we study the bulk and finite size effects in chains , rings , membranes , spherical and cylindrical shells .",
    "in particular , we investigate the bending elasticity of chains and membranes and show that there is a qualitative difference with systems with short - range forces .",
    "as we will see , most structures formed by cvdw , have properties which are inherently dictated by",
    "_ long range anisotropic many body forces_. they exhibit collective ( i.e. scale and shape dependent ) stiffness , surface tension and line tension .",
    "the physical content of the paper is schematically represented in the diagram in fig.2 , where the free - energy as a function of the _ effective non - local susceptibility _ @xmath3 plays the central role in all our studies of cvdw systems . in the microscopic theory",
    "the latter contains the 3-body ( and higher order ) interactions , while in the macroscopic theory it can be expressed via an _ effective demagnetization tensor _ @xmath4 .",
    "both approaches give rise to _ the collective , long range , shape - sensitive _ nature of the cvdw interaction .",
    "the text is organized as follows . in @xmath5 @xmath6",
    "we briefly introduce the reader into the basic properties of the magnetorheological ( mr ) colloids and describe the first experimental realization of the cvdw interaction in such systems by martin et al@xcite . in @xmath5 @xmath7",
    "we develop the basic physical and mathematical machinery to treat the cvdw interaction .",
    "we then derive the first central result of this paper : the time - averaged free - energy as the trace of the _ effective non - local susceptibility tensor _ @xmath8 .",
    "the latter tensor describes an effective interaction between two colloids mediated by all the other colloids - thus containing all many body interactions .",
    "based on the microscopic theory for the free - energy in @xmath5 @xmath9 we discuss cvdw systems and self - assemblies of colloids in various structures .    in @xmath5",
    "@xmath10 we study the formation of chains and membranes within the framework of a macroscopic mean - field theory .",
    "the consistency of the latter with the microscopic approach is discussed there as well . there",
    "we also show that the cvdw systems can be considered as systems with an effective _ negative _ surface energy . in @xmath11 @xmath12",
    "we generalize the cvdw interaction to anisotropic objects and study the interaction between multiple elementary structures , including the bead - membrane and the two membrane interaction .",
    "the interaction turns out to be very rich , anisotropic and changes sign depending on the mutual orientation of the interacting objects .",
    "based on these preparatory results , in @xmath5 @xmath13 we study the formation of the more complex emergent structures : the colloidal foams .",
    "we show that the cvdw theory predicts a positive pressure of the foam and that it swells against the gravitational field to notable heights .",
    "the most notable quantitative results are summarized in two tables at the end of @xmath5 @xmath14 .",
    "we conclude by pointing out interesting experimental effects and tests of the theory and by outlining some important open questions concerning cvdw .",
    "more detailed derivations of some formulas are contained in several appendices for the interested reader .",
    "the mathematically less interested reader is invited to browse through the figures , each of which explains a new concept , and to run through them towards the discussion .",
    "the study of responsive `` smart materials '' with remarkable properties has been intensifying in the last decades . in that respect",
    "the magnetorheological ( mr ) suspensions , made of magnetizable solid microparticles ( colloids ) , dispersed in nonmagnetic fluids and placed in magnetic fields , are of immense interest due to the rapid , large and tunable transformations in their mechanical and rheological properties . having in mind the numerous applications @xcite ,",
    "a scientific challenge is to investigate which kind of assembled structures are realized depending on combined static and oscillating magnetic fields .    in a typical mr system consisting of superparamagnetic microbeads the induced magnetic moment of a single bead @xmath15 , with @xmath16",
    "its volume and @xmath17 its magnetization , is proportional to the applied external magnetic field @xmath18 i.e. @xmath19 . here",
    ", @xmath20 stands for the shape - dependent _ bead susceptibility _ with respect to the external field .",
    "this one should not be confused with the material susceptibility @xmath21 , which characterizes the physical properties of the material itself ( not the shape ) out of which the bead is made . in the case when the bead is suspended in a solvent with a material susceptibility @xmath22 in the magnetostatic limit @xmath23 is given from @xmath24 by @xcite @xmath25    in the following we will study dipolar magnetic ( dielectric ) beads , which do not carry permanent moments @xcite . the beads , enumerated by an index @xmath26 , are assumed to be all identical , magnetically isotropic and spherically shaped .",
    "they are placed in a spatially and temporally fluctuating magnetic field @xmath27 with @xmath28 the vacuum permeability .",
    "we will focus here on the case when the field varies on an intermediate timescale @xmath29 fulfilling the condition @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 is the typical magnetic relaxation time of the paramagnetic bead , which is typically in the range of a 10th of second to microseconds .",
    "the other relevant characteristic time scale is the aggregation time @xmath32 which characterizes the bead s motion in the surrounding viscous fluid over characteristic distances comparable or larger than the bead diameter @xmath33 . under these conditions",
    "the beads magnetization @xmath34 is equilibrated much faster than its positional coordinate @xmath35 , the beads move and aggregate slowly and feel a net time - averaged force due to the dipole - dipole interaction . in general",
    ", the susceptibility @xmath36 can be a complex frequency dependent function but in the following we will restrict ourselves to the case when @xmath37 . in this case , the magnetic dissipation effects are in the first approximation negligible compared to the magnetic free - energy effects .    in general , the dynamics of the @xmath38 bead is determined by the interplay of : ( 1 ) the friction force @xmath39 with the friction coefficient @xmath40 , ( 2 ) the average dipole - dipole force @xmath41 ( with the dipole - dipole energy @xmath42 ) and ( 3 ) the fluctuating brownian force @xmath43 . however , in the following we shall consider the ( quasi-)equilibrium structures first , and postpone the bead dynamics to later works .",
    "the first concrete instance of the cvdw interaction was realized @xcite a mr suspension that was placed in a magnetic field rotating with a frequency @xmath44 on a cone with the opening angle @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 - see fig . 3a .",
    "more precisely , an ideal , fully isptropic cvdw interaction is only realized when the cone opening angle coincides with the magic angle @xmath47 .",
    "such a _ balanced triaxial magnetic field _ ( btmf ) has very special correlation properties : its components have time averaged correlations , denoted by @xmath48 , @xmath49 that are formally ( square ) isotropic .",
    "note , that this relation is true even though the btmf itself has a preferred orientation along the positive @xmath50 axis , see fig . 3a . in the most general case",
    "we can consider any field realization with such an isotropic correlation property and all particular realizations ( cf .",
    "3(a - b ) ) will be considered equivalent within our theory .",
    "in fact we will abstract away from any concrete representation of the field and take the squared isotropy eq.([sqisotropy ] ) as the defining property of the exciting field .",
    "note that in the most general case found in literature @xcite,@xcite the triaxial field is unbalanced and can have an arbitrary in - plane @xmath51 and perpendicular component @xmath52 @xmath53 with @xmath54 one can show that in this case the interaction can be linearly decomposed into a balanced triaxial field ( btmf ) magic angle interaction and a residual dipole - dipole interaction along the orthogonal direction @xcite .",
    "the latter is well understood while the former is new and investigated here .",
    "in this section we develop the mathematical formalism necessary to understand the cvdw interaction .",
    "the cvdw interaction is a general phenomenon going beyond the magnetic realm and the theory developed here is equally valid for electrically polarizable colloids , i.e. the electrorheological materials . in order to keep the continuity with refs .",
    "@xcite , we arbitrarily follow the magnetic notation . the results for electrically polarizable colloids are obtained by replacing the magnetic quantities with the corresponding electric ones .    under the condition of quick variations of the external field @xmath18 , yet a much quicker equilibration of the magnetization @xmath34 we study equilibrium structures which minimize the effective ( time averaged )  free - energy @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath56 for fixed particle positions @xmath57 .    in the following we will be dealing with purely athermal effects .",
    "this is usually well justified : due to the large moments @xmath58 of the beads with diameters @xmath59 @xmath60 , the energy per particle will be well in excess of the thermal energies making contributions of a configurational entropy negligible in practice .",
    "therefore , all external field fluctuations will be considered as extrinsically given .",
    "the basic expression for the non - equilibrium free - energy @xmath61 of magnetic colloids ( beads ) with respect to @xmath34 in inhomogeneous external time - dependent field @xmath62 can be written as @xcite@xmath63 where @xmath64 is the bead - volume of one of the @xmath65 identical beads .",
    "@xmath66 is the magnetization of the @xmath26-th bead resulting from its magnetic moment @xmath58 and @xmath23 is the _ bead ( sample ) susceptibility _ in the external field . the first term in eq.([s-1 ] )",
    "is the `` self - energy '' of the beads .",
    "it ensures that in absence of external fields there is no magnetization .",
    "the second term represents the @xmath38 bead s dipole - dipole interaction with all the other beads .",
    "it is mediated by the dipole tensor @xmath67@xmath68 with @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) and @xmath71 the normalized bonding vector , i.e. the unit vector pointing pointing from bead @xmath72 to @xmath26 . here ,",
    "we decompose conveniently the dipole tensor @xmath67 into a purely geometric @xmath73 tensor @xmath74 - a linear combination of the unity matrix @xmath75 and the pure projector on the bonding vector @xmath76 ( in the `` bra - ket ''  notation ) .",
    "the second contribution in @xmath67 is the purely distance dependent dipolar field - decay factor @xmath77    performing the minimization of @xmath78 w.r.t . @xmath34 and reintroducing the result into eq.([s-1 ] ) we arrive at the quasi - equilibrium free - energy for fixed coordinates @xmath79 @xcite @xmath80 where the quasi - equilibrium magnetization of the i - th bead @xmath81 is determined by the _ total local _",
    "fields @xmath82 acting at the position of the bead @xmath83 these local fields are given implicitly as a function of the applied external fields @xmath84 via @xmath85 the last line is strictly valid if we adopt the practical convention that @xmath86 for two identical bead indices , i.e. excluding a self - interaction of beads . by inverting eq.([hloc ] ) , the formal solution for the local fields @xmath82 reads @xmath87 here we encounter a main player in the cvdw interaction - the _ effective non - local microscopic susceptibility tensor _ defined as : @xmath88 this _ non - local microscopic susceptibility tensor _",
    "@xmath8 is crucial for understanding all the many body effects that will follow .",
    "lets take a few notes in order to understand some of its features .",
    "mathematically , it is a @xmath89- dimensional matrix , relating the external fields at all particle @xmath90 locations to the local fields at particle @xmath38 position . for any fixed @xmath26 and @xmath91 the single components @xmath3 are themselves @xmath92 dimensional second ",
    "rank tensors - i.e. @xmath73 matrices in @xmath92-dimensional space . in the following , dealing with @xmath8 and its components will be conceptually easy with a small caveat and the note of caution : the @xmath93 components @xmath94 are to be evaluated _ after _ performing the operator inversion in eq .",
    "( [ chi - eff ] ) .",
    "this is at the very origin of the many body forces ( cf .",
    "below ) .    with all theses issues and precautions about @xmath8 in mind",
    "we can now insert eq.([hloc2 ] ) into eq.([s2 ] ) and average over the fluctuating fields @xmath84 to obtain the averaged free - energy @xmath55 @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the _ field - field correlation function _",
    "defined by @xmath97 here , @xmath98 stand for the 3-spatial directions and @xmath99 are the particle indices . the eq .",
    "( [ s4 ] ) is completely general and forms the backbone for all further analysis .",
    "it holds both for the classic vdw interaction ( with appropriately chosen @xmath100 ) as well as for cvdw and generally couples the field correlators @xmath96 with the many - body interaction - encoding susceptibility @xmath101 functions .",
    "the former are given by the type of interaction ( vdw or cvdw ) while the latter depend on the spatial configuration of all particles in an interesting but ( for now ) very convoluted , little transparent manner that we want to elucidate in the following .      the decomposition of the free energy in eq .",
    "( [ s4 ] ) into an `` external influence '' term  ( the field correlator @xmath96 ) and an `` internal response '' function ( susceptibility tensor components @xmath102 ) is conceptually appealing .",
    "the remainder of the paper we will spend on exploring the physical features associated with these two terms .    in a first step ,",
    "let us investigate how different types of driving field correlations change the interactions .",
    "there are two important limiting cases for the correlator @xmath96 :    @xmath103 _ strong correlations _ with perfect spatial coherence and    @xmath104 _ no correlations _ in the driving field with perfect decoherence .",
    "these are defined in the following way :    ( @xmath105 ) the _ spatially coherent fluctuation interaction _ with the correlator @xmath106 the first term @xmath107 describes the _ isotropic _ and spatially coherent ( uniform ) excitation , while the second , @xmath108 describes a uniform constant field ( anisotropic contribution ) . in the following",
    "we restrict ourself only to the _ isotropic coherent van der waals interaction _ ( the cvdw one ) with a vanishing anisotropic component , @xmath109 i.e. @xmath110 it is easy to see that the corresponding _ cvdw free - energy _ , is then given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the trace of the effective susceptibility .",
    "note , that the coherent isotropic correlation function @xmath113 comprises also the case of the experimentally realized _",
    "balanced triaxial magnetic fields @xcite _ ( btmf ) - see @xmath5 @xmath6 and fig.3a .",
    "even though the cone at which the field precesses has a direction ( opening ) by itself , the square of the field is statistically identical in all directions and mutually uncorrelated in all directions i.e. @xmath114 .",
    "the btmf is therefore only one instance of a general coherent isotropic field .",
    "any other realization , like e.g. one of those in fig 3b satisfies the relation ( [ s4 ] ) and consequently has the same energy eq .",
    "( [ c0 ] ) .",
    "( @xmath115 ) _ the spatially  incoherently excited fields _ are realized for @xmath116 .",
    "the latter may in principle contain isotropic and anisotropic terms , too .",
    "note , that the term proportional to @xmath117 means that the correlations of magnetic field fluctuations on different particles vanish . in the completely _ isotropic _",

    "the free - energy @xmath120 _ contains a summation over the index _",
    "@xmath26 _ only _ , i.e. it includes only the diagonal terms @xmath121 - sometimes called the self - energy terms .",
    "this is equivalent to the usual van der waals ( vdw ) interaction and in the following this part of the free - energy will be called the vdw one .",
    "however in the novel case ( @xmath105 ) @xmath122 contains the more complex , double summation over @xmath26 and @xmath72 which gives rise to unusual , non - local and anisotropic many body effects in cvdw system - most of which are absent in a standard vdw system ( case @xmath115 ) . in the coherent case ,",
    "the terms @xmath123 with @xmath70 , describe the effective coupling between the @xmath26-th and @xmath72-th bead acting directly or indirectly via all other beads , thus giving rise to very specific and anisotropic _ many body  interactions_. the latter will turn out to be a crucial effect for cvdw matter and will be responsible for the formation of hierarchical assemblies of colloids .",
    "this is in strong contrast with the standard vdw systems where 3d bulk structures such as droplets and close - packed 3d crystal structures are favored and realized .",
    "in this section we will explore how a _",
    "microscopic cvdw  theory _ , based on the effective energy eq.([s5 ] ) and the non - local many body susceptibility eq.([chi - eff ] ) works in practice . while the energy eq.([s5 ] ) appears ( deceptively ) straightforward to evaluate , the many body susceptibility operator eq.([chi - eff ] )",
    "is a sophisticated mathematical object . to grasp physical insights about the latter , except for",
    "the simplest case of two spherical beads , seems challenging .    after dealing with the elementary case of two particles , which can be treated exactly",
    ", we will resort to the approximation of small bead susceptibility i.e. @xmath124 - a limiting case that allows a controllable evaluation of the many body interactions . in this spirit",
    "we will be making an energy expansion up to lowest order in @xmath23 .",
    "notably , this lowest order expansion of the energy , as we will see , comprises both the 2-body interaction of beads and the non - local 3-body interactions at the same order .",
    "as it will be shown both these interactions ( 2 and 3 body ) scale identically with distance for cvdw , i.e. @xmath125 . the _ 2 + 3 body inseparability",
    "_ is the most peculiar _",
    "hallmark signature of the cvdw interaction _ , and to our knowledge stands out rather uniquely among other known many - body forces in nature .",
    "let us start out elementary and consider a very dilute system .",
    "in such a case the _ pairwise _ bead - bead ( @xmath126-body ) interaction should dominate in the free - energy @xmath122 . while this assumption of dominant 2-body forces turns out as too naive ( see the next subsection )",
    "it is still natural to consider only two interacting particles first . for two beads 1 and 2 the non - local susceptibility operator @xmath8 is easily calculated by using eq .",

    "incoherent ( standard )  vdw _ case the energy @xmath130 is the sum of the @xmath131 diagonals ( note @xmath132 ) i.e. @xmath133 @xmath134on the other hand , for the _ coherent cvdw _ interaction we have to sum all four elements of @xmath131  ( note @xmath135 ) obtaining @xmath136    interestingly , the coherent and the incoherent 2 bead interaction energy look very similar but are _ not _ identical . after expanding the energies in powers of @xmath137",
    "we see that @xmath138  and @xmath139 or in terms of the bead - bead distance @xmath140 : @xmath141 we observe that the first interaction terms @xmath142 exactly coincide .",
    "this interesting @xmath126-body result was first obtained by martin and coworkers @xcite and confirmed experimentally by osterman et al .",
    "@xcite . however , the higher order terms in @xmath143 and @xmath144 scale quite differently , and they are @xmath145 and @xmath146 , respectively .",
    "this makes the cvdw interaction slightly stronger ( more attractive ) than the usual incoherent vdw .",
    "now , if it was only for this slight difference between the two , investigating the cvdw would hardly be very interesting .",
    "but we will see soon that the 3-body forces are a real game changer , giving the cvdw  interaction its unique character and flavor .      for the standard ( incoherent )",
    "vdw interaction the @xmath126-body interaction is @xmath147 in leading order and since the 3-body ( and higher order ) interactions are shorter ranged ( cf .",
    "below ) and much smaller in magnitude than the 2body ones , vdw favors the formation of close packed droplet - like or 3d bulk ( crystalline ) structures with high symmetries @xcite . if the 2-body interaction - given by eq.([bead - bead ] )",
    "- would dominate the behavior of cvdw as well , one would also expect the formation of bulk droplets .",
    "however this is in sharp contrast to experimental evidence @xcite which shows a clear _ tendency for chain and membrane formation _ ,",
    "i.e. for low - dimensional structures under cvdw .",
    "what is the microscopic origin of these complex and low dimensional ( anisotropic ) structures in cvdw systems ?    in the following we will explore how this remarkable difference of the two forces emerges once the three body forces are considered .",
    "to this end we consider the free energy eq.([s5 ] ) with eq.([chi - eff ] ) in the general case of @xmath148 particles .",

    "inseparable _ _ _ from the _ @xmath92__-body one__. therefore the @xmath92-body interaction must be treated on the same footing as the @xmath126-body one .",
    "this fact shows us the pitfall in the dimer formation section which considered the @xmath126-body interaction alone .",
    "interestingly , @xmath195 in eq.([3-body ] ) is very anisotropic and has a specific angular dependence .",
    "this angular dependence intuitively hints towards the explanation of the tendency of cvdw interaction not to form 3d bulk structures , but to drive the formation of anisotropic 1d and 2d structures .",
    "for instance , the @xmath196 term in @xmath187 favors either @xmath197 or @xmath198- i.e. a colloidal chains , membranes are preferred by the many body interactions .      in this section",
    "we investigate how the 3-body cvdw interaction works in a simple physical limit .",
    "let us consider only 3 beads and place two of them , say @xmath199 and @xmath126 , very close to each other at distance @xmath200 , while the bead number @xmath92 is at large distance from @xmath199 and @xmath126 , i.e. we assume @xmath201 .",
    "the free - energy eq.([3-body ] ) is calculated in @xmath127 @xmath202 and the expression up to the the lowest order in the distance is @xmath203 where the first term is the 2-body interaction between particles @xmath199 and @xmath126 .",
    "the peculiarity of the second term in eq.([f3-r ] ) , i.e. the three - body interaction is readily seen , when two particles are very near and the third one is far away . from eq.([f3-r ] ) it comes out that for the bead arrangement shown in fig.5 , although the two body interactions @xmath204 and @xmath205 are attractive , the third bead is repelled from the first two as a consequence of the anisotropic 3-body interactions .",
    "this is due to the condition @xmath206 making @xmath207 for @xmath208 in the configuration of fig .",
    "the second interesting observation that we can make from eq.([f3-r ] ) is that for a fixed dimer size @xmath209 , the third particle interacts with the point - like two particle complex via a `` long - range '' force @xmath210 .",
    "the @xmath211 dimer , instead of the two single monomers becomes now the emerging elementary unit governed by different laws than single particles .",
    "this example is quite instructive and tells us a lot about the very nature of cvdw . on the one hand particles display many - body effects which override their individual pairwise interaction in most general configurations .",
    "however there is another idea emerging from the same example , which simplifies dealing with the cvdw quite a bit .",
    "when two beads come together - i.e. `` lump '' together by attractive forces - and find themselves much closer then to the rest of the beads , they can be considered as a new combined entity- the dimer .",
    "now , the dimer itself interacts with the rest of the world by an anisotropic , angle dependent , longer ranged interaction @xmath210 ( instead of @xmath212 ) , and this interaction is now 2-body , pairwise and is attractive for @xmath213 .",
    "the concept of `` lumping '' works generally , also for more than 3 particles which are forming anisotropic lumps out of closely packed aggregates of particles .",
    "the usefulness of the lumping idea  will become more clear in sections that will follow .",
    "in particular , we will derive how beads lumped together inside of chains or membranes interact with other beads and other lumps in the far field .",
    "the consideration of the pairwise interactions of such lumps , instead of all many - body interactions of all particles , will be an enormous simplification .",
    "here we study consequences of the many body effects in cvdw chains and membranes with finite number ( @xmath65 ) of particles , - called finite n - effects .",
    "additionally , we study their unusual elastic properties and compare with more classical systems with short range forces . in order to grasp the physics of the problem in the simplest form",

    "the first @xmath219 term is the free - energy per particle of an infinite chain , while the leading finite @xmath65 term is of order @xmath220 .",
    "the latter is the price the last few edge particles ( at both free ends ) pay for being at the end of the chain .",
    "note that , this edge energy being positive indicates that the chain would like to be closed eventually ( i.e. elliminate free ends ) , provided that the bending energy for doing so is less than the gained edge energy .",
    "( @xmath221 ) _ young s modulus for linear chain _ - if one generates a slight increase of the distance @xmath222 between bead centers , i.e @xmath223 then the young s modulus of the stretched chain can be formally defined by the second derivative of the free energy like @xmath224 , where the bead cross - section surface is @xmath225 . from eq.([lin - chain ] ) one obtains @xmath226 i.e. the effective young s modulus scales quadratically with external field ( for small @xmath23 ) and is independent of the bead diameter @xmath222 . for @xmath227 ( paramagnetic beads ) it is of course @xmath228 , which guarantees stability of the chain . in case of @xmath229 ( effective diamagnetic beads - when the medium susceptibility @xmath230 ) one has @xmath231 and the chain is unstable due to the repulsive forces of effectively diamagnetic beads .",
    "( @xmath232 ) _ bending energy of ring _ - in another situation , instead of stretching the chain , we can bend its center line and close it into a ring .",
    "the free - energy per particle in this case is calculated in @xmath127 @xmath233 and reads@xmath234 the first ( leading ) term is the same as for the infinite linear chain , while the second term in eq.([ring ] ) can be related to the bending elasticity energy per particle of the coherent vdw chain .",
    "usually , the bending modulus ( stiffness ) @xmath235 for the chain with short range forces is defined as the prefactor in the bending energy@xmath236 where the latter is true for a ring . here , @xmath237 is the unit tangent vector @xmath238 and @xmath239 .    by interpreting the cvdw ring in this elasticity framework",
    "a first surprise comes out . from eq.([ring ] ) and eq.([fbend ] ) we see an anomalous behavior of the effective bending modulus @xmath240 i.e. @xmath241 grows logarithmically with the chain size .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively very different from the case of the chain with short range interaction , where @xmath242is always a n - independent constant .",
    "the logarithmic stiffness of chains is caused by the long - range many body nature of cvdw .",
    "it is interesting to note that even though the bending stiffness is growing , the chain closure cost ( per bead )  @xmath243 is becoming quickly smaller with large n. a comparison of the ring energy eq.([ring ] ) with the straight chain result eq.([lin - chain ] ) tells us that the rings will indeed become more preferable for long enough chains with @xmath244",
    "as in the case of linear chains we can consider the elastic and finite size properties of flat and curved membranes .",
    "most of the results in this section can be derived from the phenomenological macroscopic ( demagnetization tensor ) approach for fat cylinders , hollow spheres etc . presented in the forthcoming sections , while others are obtained by discrete summations .",

    "this behavior is also confirmed in the macroscopic theory ( studied below ) for the continuous hollow sphere .",
    "after the logarithmic stiffness of the chain ( with @xmath268 ) , the non - locality of the bending stiffness of membrane is another signature of the anisotropic and long range 3-body nature of the coherent interaction in cvdw systems .",

    "however , from energetic point of view , the absolute energy minimum in the subcritical regime is reached for the flatter i.e. oblate shape ( lower @xmath417 stable branch ) .",
    "the elongated prolate ellipsoid forms only a shallow local minimum and is therefore thermodynamically only metastable .",
    "the effective surface tension @xmath418 is in reality a many - body bulk term and thus size dependent .",
    "let us estimate on which scale it becomes relevant , for instance , in a drop of water , with surface tension @xmath419 ( at room temperature ) .",
    "for @xmath420 and @xmath421 , the cvdw surface tension is @xmath422 . for this to be of the same order as @xmath423 we need the radius of the droplet to be @xmath424 . for larger droplets made of paramagnetic beads with @xmath425",
    "the spherical shape becomes unstable .",
    "in the dielectric analogue of this phenomenon in cvdw systems we would have @xmath426 .",
    "let us assume that the dielectric droplet has much smaller dielectric susceptibility than of the electric beads ( @xmath427 ) and that the surface tension is of the order as that of water .",
    "then for a feasible electric field @xmath428 , @xmath429 @xmath430 , and for @xmath431 we have @xmath432 !",
    "this means that this effect is less favorable in the electric case .",
    "however , for magnetic colloids ( such as ferrofluids ) under magnetically induced cvdw , the `` negative surface tension '' instability effect should be easily observable .",
    "in magnetically driven cvdw systems chains and membranes are the predominant structures formed on intermediate length and timescales @xcite .",
    "however , the experiments also show that in more dense colloid systems which are placed in containers of finite volume , more complex structures like foams are formed on larger scales .",
    "the existence of these foam structures is also confirmed in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the basic motif underlying such foams , is a complex network of interconnected membrane patches , which apart from touching along their edges do not stack and aggregate .",
    "instead the membranes seem , at least by visual inspection , to repel each other and the whole foam structure appears to swell against gravity .",
    "what is the origin of such large scale cvdw foam structures ?    in this section we give a plausible physical explanation by combining both the microscopic and macroscopic approaches .",
    "first , we will study the cvdw interaction free - energy of two flat membranes .",
    "we show below that this interaction switches from an attraction to a repulsion , depending on the mutual orientation .    while in general",
    ", the interactions between two membranes can have both signs , it turns out that in the majority of possible configurations the interaction is in fact repulsive on the average .",
    "then , we calculate the free - energy of the foam structure by modelling it by a cubic shelf structure ansatz .",
    "we show that such a structure indeed tends to swell and at the end we derive something that reassembles an equation of state of a cvdw foam , i.e. a pressure - concentration - field relation .",
    "we show that the magnitude of this pressure is quite notable and can indeed lead to a rise of the foam to measurable heights .      in the previous sections",
    "we were concerned with interactions of isotropic spherical particles whose susceptibility tensors were merely diagonal @xmath433  i.e. simply a number . here",
    "we generalize the interaction to any two arbitrary shaped bodies .",
    "in general this is a complicated problem when the bodies are very close .",
    "however , when they are far enough , say much further than their typical body extensions , the field of any object can be replaced with a corresponding effective ellipsoid field . in this sense",
    "it is sufficient to consider the interaction of two ellipsoids , with orientation dependent and non - trivial susceptibility tensors @xmath434 .",
    "the free - energy in this case can be rewritten in the form @xmath435 where @xmath436 and @xmath437 are now effective susceptibility tensors of the two bodies ( ellipsoids ) with respective volumes @xmath438 .",
    "the effective susceptibility tensors are now given by the expression @xmath439 and same for the second @xmath437 which is obtained by replacing @xmath440 .",
    "the slightly more intricate form of @xmath441 which is obviously a generalization of the corresponding isotropic expression eq.([chi - eff ] ) ,  comes now from the fact that the operator @xmath442 and the susceptibilities @xmath443 are operators with spacial orientations which do nt commute now any more in general .",
    "the expressions in eq.([m1 ] -[m2 ] ) are general and contain the distance dependence through the scalar factor @xmath444 in a slightly scrambled form that hides the leading order scaling .",
    "thus , it is interesting to expand @xmath445  to the first order w.r.t .",
    "@xmath446and obtain the leading order interaction part @xmath447 here we omit trivial self - energies , i.e. consider the interaction energy term only , and assume the two bodies to have the same volume @xmath10 .",
    "note that , when the objects are isotropic ( e.g. spheres , point like ) then the @xmath448 turn simply into numbers . reminding ourselves that @xmath449 is traceless we see that the whole term @xmath450 vanishes in the isotropic case .",
    "this is why the cvdw interaction for two spheres only starts out with a higher order leading @xmath451 interaction term .",
    "however in general , for anisotropic objects the trace in eq.([m3 ] ) is non - zero , giving rise to a strong and long range interaction @xmath452 @xmath453 .",
    "that is , anisotropic objects interact much stronger than isotropic ones under cvdw .",
    "once growing aggregates become shape anisotropic and notably they always tend to do so ( forming chains and membranes ) , they interact in a long range manner .",
    "this can be seen as another manifestation of the cooperative many - body nature of cvdw .      to understand the content of the anisotropic cvdw interaction from eq.([m3 ] ) , let us have a look at how a flat membrane interacts with a single spherical bead .",
    "the effects of beads approaching chains and membranes were previously studied numerically by osterman et al .",
    "interestingly , it turns out , that even in this simplest case the interaction can vary in sign .",
    "it is attractive when the membrane is approached by the bead from the edge side .",
    "when however approaching from the top , in the direction of the membrane normal ,  the bead is repelled in the far field . if the bead approaches the membrane even further ( against the repulsive force ) and comes closer in this normal direction , the interaction switches again to a short range attraction .",
    "obviously there is a barrier to cross in this normal direction .",
    "the largest barrier for joining of the bead to the membrane is when the former is above the center of the membrane and we study this case first - see fig.(7a ) . by applying eq.([s5 ] ) on two particles , where the first one is big and anisotropic - it mimics a membrane , while the second one is small and isotropic - it mimics a bead , one obtains the free - energy in the form@xmath454 here , @xmath455 , @xmath456 and @xmath457 , @xmath64 is the volume of the membrane and bead , respectively , while @xmath458 and @xmath459 the effective susceptibilities of membrane and bead respectively with @xmath460 and @xmath459 is obtained by replacing @xmath461 in eq.([chi - m ] ) and @xmath462 . in this approach",
    "the membrane is replaced by an oblate spheroid with the susceptibility @xmath463 , while for the spherical bead we have @xmath464 ; @xmath465 is the unit vector normal to the membrane .",
    "the tensor @xmath466 in eq.([chi - m ] ) is @xmath467 .",
    "since we assume that the membrane s dimensions are much larger than the bead size @xmath222 and the bead is above the membrane one has @xmath468 @xmath469 , i.e. @xmath470 @xmath471 .",
    "the final expression for the dimensionless free - energy @xmath472 is given by ( cf .",
    "@xmath127 @xmath473 ) @xmath474@xmath475 where @xmath476 , @xmath477 ; @xmath478 .",
    "let us discuss the energy of the membrane - bead complex as a function of their distance @xmath479 by assuming ( for simplicity ) that @xmath480 i.e. a very flat membrane .",
    "since @xmath481 one has @xmath482 and the expression simplifies to @xmath483 from eq.([w - mb ] ) we see that there is an energy barrier for the bead , i.e. for @xmath484 the membrane repels the bead since @xmath485 , while for @xmath486 the force is attractive ( @xmath487 ) . as an example",
    "we take @xmath488 and @xmath489 which gives us the barrier at a notable distance @xmath490 - larger then the bead size .",
    "based on the same formalism it is straightforward to show that when the bead is placed in the plane containing the membrane , i.e. when @xmath491 @xmath469 holds , it is always attracted to the membrane , i.e. @xmath487 .    to conclude , the above considerations show that the most favorable and fastest membrane growth pathway is addition of beads along the membrane edges in membrane s plane . those beads found above",
    "the membrane must move parallel to the membrane and finally descend toward the ends of membranes .",
    "this is schematically shown in fig.7a for a bead interacting with a membrane and in a fig.7b for a bead interacting with a chain ( prolate ellipsoid ) . in the latter case calculations",
    "go along the same lines as for membranes , with the only difference being in flipping the signs of interaction .",
    "the beads are repelled laterally and attracted along the symmetry axis of the chains .",
    "the easy calculation being very similar as for membranes is omitted here .",
    "once they emerge , what is the fate of the membranes as they continue growing ? at some point the membranes will run out of free beads in the solution and start interacting only with the remaining aggregates which turn into membranes once they are large enough .",
    "to understand , how two membranes mutually order , we need the _",
    "_  2-membrane interaction _ _ for arbitrary membrane orientations @xmath492 and anisotropic susceptibilities @xmath493 . for identical membranes and at large distances ( @xmath494 , i.e. for @xmath495 ) one expands @xmath496 @xmath497 and the long range interaction energy in eq.([chi - eff ] ) after a short calculation reads ( see details in @xmath127 @xmath498 ) , @xmath499 with @xmath500 and @xmath501 the ratio of the minimal / maximal eigenvalue of the membrane susceptibility tensor @xmath279 .",
    "the dimensionless factors @xmath502 , @xmath503 , @xmath504 reveal all the geometrical beauty of cvdw : the 2-membrane interaction is angle dependent and repulsive in many configurations - see fig.8 .",
    "notably , for a fixed @xmath505 , @xmath506 becomes minimal for the orthogonally _ twisted _ membrane orientation with @xmath507 , @xmath508 and @xmath509 ( @xmath510 ) .",
    "the twisted membranes attract each other since @xmath511 ( up to the point of mutual contact ) , as in the _ coplanar _ case , yet the _ twisted _ configuration has lower energy .",
    "this interesting result should affect the kinetics of membrane formation : if two distant membranes start growing within a large distance they will rotate to a @xmath512 position before touching .",
    "therefore , some type of glassy state in their orientation may be kinetically favored .",
    "in other relevant configurations , such as the _ top _ , with two out of plane parallel membranes ( @xmath513 ) or the _ generic _ one ( cf .",
    "fig.8 ) , the interaction is repulsive with @xmath514 .",
    "simulations and experiments @xcite provide some empirical evidence for the existence of a hollow foam - like superstructure forming on large scales ( cf .",
    "what is the physical mechanism driving such a cvdw foam formation ?",
    "we have seen above that large aggregates prefer to form membranes , and that these membranes mutually interact .",
    "specifically , when two distant membranes are stacked over each other they repel each other ( @xmath515 ) . in the opposite limit - in close contact distance-",
    "a simple estimate implies their preference to split as well .",
    "namely , when a thick membrane , with the thickness @xmath256 , radius @xmath252 and volume @xmath516 , is cut into two parallel membranes , with the thickness @xmath222 and radius @xmath252 each and separated to infinite distance there is a gain in the energy @xmath517 for @xmath518 , where @xmath519 .",
    "physically this means that the second membrane lying above the first one is repelled to increase the local fields with respect to the thicker membrane case .",
    "it is this remarkable reluctance of membranes to mutually stack that in fact sets the microscopic structure of the foam : it is formed out of the thinnest possible membrane patches , whose thickness is collapsed onto the smallest available physical scale - the bead size @xmath222 .",
    "the characteristic lateral size @xmath520 of these membrane patches , on the other hand , is set by the bead volume fraction in the container @xmath521 ( with @xmath522 the  total volume of all beads and @xmath10 the container s volume ) . by assuming a cubic shelf structure as an ansatz , cf .",
    "fig 9b , one obtains a patch size @xmath523 .    in order to calculate the pressure in such a foam structure we need the total interaction free - energy of all membranes in the system .",
    "it turns out that the interaction part of the free - energy ( @xmath506 ) of the assumed cubic shelf structure is positive ( @xmath524 ) due to global average repulsion of membranes - see @xmath127 @xmath525 .",
    "in the previous section we have argued qualitatively that in the cvdw foam structure the positive interaction free - energy should favor an effective repulsion between constituent membranes forming this structure , i.e. that the foam should exert a pressure on walls of the container and in fact swell . in this section",
    "we calculate this pressure as a function of the volume fraction of magnetic beads , i.e. we derive the equation of state for a cvdw material .    as above",
    "we define the volume fraction of all beads in the container @xmath526 where @xmath527 is the volume of the single membrane and @xmath528 is the total number of ( equal ) membranes in the container volume @xmath529 , and @xmath530 is the total volume of the beads . here ,",
    "@xmath222 is the bead diameter and @xmath520 is the size of the single membrane - see fig.9b .",
    "it follows that @xmath531 .    in the following we fix the total volume of all @xmath528 membranes @xmath532 and",
    "vary the size of the container @xmath10 .",
    "the pressure is then defined by @xmath533 where @xmath534 is the total energy of the membranes .",
    "@xmath535 is the self - energy of ( non - interacting ) membranes and @xmath536 is the interaction energy of membranes . from eq.([f - macro1 ] ) the free - energy of the @xmath528 single membranes ( the self - energy ) with the total volume @xmath532 is given by @xmath537@xmath538 for simplicity , we study here only the case with large material susceptibility @xmath539 ( note that , the material susceptibility fulfills @xmath540 , where @xmath23 is the bead susceptibility with respect to the applied ( external ) field ) and at the same time @xmath541 ( @xmath542 ) .    in the following we approximate , for simplicity , the membranes by oblate spheroids .",
    "the demagnetization factor of the flat membranes in the plane direction can be related with the membrane aspect ratio , which itself is set by the volume fraction @xmath543 ( for @xmath544 ) . after a straightforward expansion with respect to small @xmath545 one obtains@xmath546 where @xmath547 is independent of the volume fraction @xmath548 .",
    "the _ total interaction energy _ of membranes @xmath536 is on the other hand@xmath549 where the pair - interaction energy @xmath550 is given by eq.([me - me ] ) where the summation goes over all membranes in the container .",
    "note , that for the nearest neighbor membranes with @xmath551 the far field approximation eq.([me - me ] ) holds qualitatively only , while for the next - nearest neighbors it holds already quantitatively . for @xmath552 and @xmath541 eq.([p4 ] ) gives @xmath553 where the explicit expression for the sum @xmath554 - a numeric dimensionless constant - is calculated by explicitly summing over all the pairwise membrane - membrane interactions ( given by eq.([me - me ] ) ) in the cubic shelf lattice , for details cf .",
    "@xmath127 @xmath525 .",
    "finally , combining both contributions to the free energy ( self - energy and total interactions ) , the total pressure of the foam in a container with the volume @xmath10 is given by @xmath555 as a result the foam s pressure is given by the approximate expression @xmath556 interestingly , this pressure can assume notable magnitudes in practice .",
    "for moderate volume fractions , reasonable fields and susceptibilities ( @xmath557 @xmath558 and @xmath559 in densely packed @xmath560-beads membranes ) we obtain @xmath561 @xmath562 . since @xmath563 , the pressure is very sensitive to the strength of the excitation ( field ) @xmath564 and can lead to strong swelling of the foam against gravity .",
    "the latter effect is also observed experimentally @xcite and can be used to practically test the equation of state eq.([pressure-1 ] ) .      since a real foam",
    "is formed in the gravitation field , the gravity can limit its swelling . as we see from eq.([pressure-1 ] ) the foam s pressure @xmath565 is proportional to @xmath566 and in the gravitational field both are dependent on the vertical height position @xmath293 along the gravity direction .",
    "if one assumes that at @xmath567 the volume fraction takes the value @xmath568 and the pressure @xmath569 then ( in case of constant @xmath548 and @xmath565 ) the foam would grow up to the maximal hight @xmath570 , where @xmath571 is the gravitational acceleration and @xmath572 is the difference in densities of magnetic beads and solvent .",
    "for instance , for water immersed @xmath560-beads as in refs .",
    "@xcite one has @xmath573 . for @xmath574 @xmath558 and @xmath559 in",
    "densely packed @xmath560-beads membranes one obtains the pressure @xmath575 @xmath562 and the equilibrium foam height @xmath293 is reached once the internal and the gravitational pressure balance , i.e. @xmath576 and the foam will swell strongly up to @xmath577 @xmath578 .",
    "the variation of pressure @xmath579 and the volume fraction @xmath580 with the hight in the gravitational field changes this approximative analysis slightly . in the gravitational field one",
    "has @xmath581 by using the equation of state in eq.([pressure-1 ] ) - with @xmath582 , the solution of eq.([dp - dh ] ) reads @xmath583 the the maximal height is reached when @xmath584 , i.e. when @xmath585 . for the above parameters one obtains @xmath586 @xmath578 .",
    "therefore , the strong swelling behavior of magnetic foams can be used as a sensitive test of the theory .",
    "we have studied the formation of hierarchical superstructures in systems driven by the spatially coherent van der waals ( cvdw ) interaction .",
    "we have developed a fairly general formalism involving the effective susceptibility tensor which allowed us to walk through all the important aspects of the cvdw interaction . within this setting , in a bottom up",
    "approach we investigated numerous phenomena , from dimer formation , over 3 body forces , then collective elasticity of intermediate structures ( chains and membranes ) up to the presumably highest scale of pattern formation , i.e. to the cvdw foams .",
    "in the theory we took a bird s view approach , and we have shown that the cvdw interaction can be equivalently created in many types of excitation fields , generalizing the triaxial balanced fields used in the past .",
    "it turned out that the consideration of a general square isotropic uniform field ( rather then any particular realization of it ) , brings the cvdw and its classical incoherent vdw `` sister-''interaction onto a common footing .",
    "this parallel consideration of cvdw- and vdw - matter allowed us also to crystallize out the common behavior , but more importantly the central differences between the two types of forces behind them .",
    "the most remarkable difference is found in the 3-body interactions .",
    "for the standard vdw matter the 3-body forces are recovered in the fully incoherent limit of our formalism and they agree with the classic result of axilrod and teller @xcite .",
    "these vdw 3-body forces are much weaker and shorter ranged than the corresponding 2-body forces , i.e. one could say they are _ subdominant _ and give only higher order corrections .",
    "in sharp contrast , in the cvdw - matter the 3-body forces derived here are as strong and often even stronger than the pairwise 2-body ones .",
    "thus , the 3-body effects under the cvdw interaction can be considered as _ essential _ and _ dominant _ forces in the system . to our knowledge",
    ", this `` many body dominance '' makes the cvdw force stand out among other known interactions and gives it a very unique , interesting character .",
    "we have studied the physical origin of these dominant cvdw many body forces and we found them originating from the fact that the direct ( induced ) dipole - dipole interactions between isotropic objects vanish ( are averaged out ) and only the many- body mutual polarization effects survive the statistical averaging over the external excitation fields .",
    "the pronounced _ anisotropy _ of the many - body interactions in the cvdw - matter systems also gives rise to a number of phenomena that are qualitatively different from standard vdw - matter , in particular the growth of anisotropic , low - dimensional assemblies - chains , then membranes once a critical size is reached . in a container of finite size , smaller membrane patches are formed , which tend to repel on the average , thus giving rise to dipolar foam structures .",
    "the foam exerts a positive pressure onto the walls of the sample container due to the tendency of membranes to increase their surface areas as well as their mutual repulsion .",
    "the dipolar foam represents a new and intriguing state of colloidal matter , formed by a delicate interplay of an attractive local interaction and a net repulsive longer range force . remarkably , both types of forces are born out of a single , conceptually simple cvdw interaction - given by eq.([s5 ] ) .",
    "the interactions driving the hierarchy of the assembly processes , from dimers to foams are summarized in figs.10 and 11 , where the 2-body and anisotropic 3-body interactions are responsible for the formation of chains , membranes and vesicles , while the membrane - membrane interaction is responsible for the formation of foams in a container with finite volume .",
    "we have also argued that the finite size ( finite particle number @xmath65 ) effects in cvdw - matter are very different from other common interactions like vdw or e.g. for classical magnetic beads with permanent moments .",
    "the many - body forces are also found to play a crucial role in the _ anomalous elastic properties _ of chains and membranes . for , instance the bending stiffness of a cvdw ring and the cvdw spherical membrane s stiffness",
    "are proportional to @xmath587 and @xmath588 , respectively , which is a direct consequence of the specifically induced long - range many body effects in these systems .",
    "the theory suggests a number of interesting and feasible _ experiments _ that can be performed to test the theoretical predictions about the interactions in the cvdw - matter :    @xmath199 .",
    "it would be very interesting to experimentally probe the dynamics of exactly @xmath92 beads and the behavior of 3-body forces , cf .",
    "for instance the surprising attraction / repulsion effects in fig .",
    "the experiment can be performed for microscopic or macroscopic beads ( the effect is scale independent ) .",
    "since 3 beads always span a common plain , the most general dynamics can be observed directly in a single focal plain , e.g. on the microscopy glass - slide on which the beads naturally settle down by gravity .",
    "the predicted negative effective surface tension and the instability of millimetric ferrofluid droplets , like in fig . 6 , would be a rather simple experimental test of the theory .",
    "also the shape bistability , i.e. the coexistence of prolate and oblate shapes of the droplets , would be an interesting qualitative outcome to be tested .",
    "bending cvdw chains and flat membrane patches , either by active forces or passively by their own weight and observing their deflections should experimentally reveal the presence of the predicted anomalous , size dependent stiffness .",
    "the most telling and fundamental experiment would be to directly probe the equation of state for a foam material .",
    "measuring actively the forces on the container walls or passively observing the rising height of the foam against gravity would be two simple possibilities to test the predicted internal pressure equation for the cvdw foams .",
    "finally , the central theoretical and experimental question , in our opinion , remains  if and how the cvdw can be generally realized in nature .",
    "in particular , we might ask if it can be induced in a truly _ equilibrium _ system .",
    "the previous realizations , in field driven colloidal systems were all non - equilibrium .",
    "however there is no principal aspect of the theory that is specific and restricted to a non equilibrium system only .",
    "while the driving field amplitudes in our case are externally set , in an equilibrium system they would satisfy a fluctuation dissipation condition which would relate them to the temperature and the susceptibilities of the particles in the system .",
    "we might speculate that in some long - range correlated fluctuating media , like those considered in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) the cvdw can indeed be realized even in equilibrium .",
    "if the fluctuations of the medium are sufficiently longer ranged than the typical sizes of the formed structures , the assembly will be driven by the cvdw interactions instead of the vdw ones on these scales .",
    "it is important to note that a simple tweak in the way how the interaction is induced ( by switching from incoherent to coherent  excitation ) , enormously increases the `` morphogenic capacity '' of the interaction i.e. its ability to form complex structures .",
    "if we are interested in the self - assembly of anything more complex than a spherical droplet ( for which the standard vdw - matter is good enough ) , cvdw - matter would be a better candidate than the simple vdw one .",
    "the exploration and utilization of novel non - equilibrium ( field - driven ) or equilibrium realizations of cvdw interactions is an interesting future challenge .",
    "it could open the doors to deeper many - body studies of complex self - assembled materials , and more importantly to technological applications of the potentially very versatile and powerful cvdw - matter .",
