    "the classical picture wherein massive elliptical galaxies form `` monolithically '' at @xmath7 @xcite has been replaced by more nuanced scenarios that decouple the epoch at which these galaxies formed the bulk of their stars from the epoch ( or epochs ) at which these stars were assembled to form the final galaxy .",
    "these more complex scenarios arise fairly naturally within the context of the hierarchical growth of structure in the now favored @xmath8cdm cosmology ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the assembly history of massive galaxies is still far from clear , and is the focus of this work .",
    "the evolving space density of massive galaxies over time provides important clues to their assembly history .",
    "evolution in the galaxy stellar mass function ( gsmf ) since @xmath10 appears quite mild for the most massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "estimates of evolution in the luminosity function are also consistent with massive galaxies passively evolving from @xmath11 to the present @xcite .",
    "these same observations also find roughly a doubling in the _ total _ stellar mass density from @xmath10 to @xmath2  the implication being that star formation occurs primarily in less massive galaxies at @xmath12 .",
    "in addition to number counts , estimates of the merger rate of massive galaxies can in principle constrain their assembly history , though current observations fail to present a consistent picture @xcite .",
    "the majority of massive elliptical galaxies are ( or have been in their recent past ) the brightest cluster galaxies within large group- or cluster - sized halos ( referred to simply as `` clusters '' in the remainder of the paper ) , located near the centers of the halo potential well .",
    "it is thus interesting to study the formation of such galaxies in the general context of cluster formation .",
    "if , as recent observations suggest , the majority of massive galaxies were already in place at @xmath10 , then on the surface it appears difficult to reconcile this with the much more substantial evolution of their host dark matter halos ( massive halos grow by factors of @xmath13 in mass since @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is one of the goals of the present work to address and resolve this tension .    within the @xmath8cdm framework",
    ", groups and clusters of galaxies are expected to be continually accreting new galaxies . after entering a cluster , the stars in satellite galaxies",
    "can 1 ) be all deposited onto the central galaxy , 2 ) stay bound as a satellite galaxy , or 3 ) be scattered into the intra - cluster light ( icl ) . for the purposes of this study we define the icl as the stars beyond the optical radius of the central galaxy , i.e. the light not accounted for in the photometry of the central galaxy itself . in reality",
    ", a combination of these possibilities can occur .",
    "for example , a satellite galaxy can be partially stripped and deposit a fraction of its stellar mass into the icl before merging and contributing the rest of the stars to the central galaxy .",
    "in addition , when two massive galaxies merge , a certain fraction of stars will acquire large kinetic energy and will move to large radii , outside the optical radius of the remnant . while evolution in the space density of massive galaxies",
    "strongly constrains the importance of the first scenario , this observation can not readily distinguish between scenarios two and three .",
    "fortunately , fates 2 ) and 3 ) have effects on observable properties of the icl , which can thus constrain the amount of stars that can be lost to the icl during mergers or tidal stripping .",
    "these observations suggest that the fraction of total cluster light bound up in the icl is @xmath14% @xcite , with the icl comprising a significant fraction ( @xmath15% ) of the combined light from the central galaxy and icl ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* note that this fraction depends sensitively on the way that the icl and bcg are separated ) .",
    "additionally , models in which the stellar component of satellite halos is never disrupted by tides would have quite different predictions for the number of satellite galaxies in a halo of a given mass , and thus for the small - scale clustering of galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the clustering of massive galaxies in combination with their evolving space density has recently been exploited by @xcite to constrain the disruption rate of massive satellite galaxies between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the goal of this study is to confront these and other observational constraints _ simultaneously _ with a series of simple , simulation - based models in order to gain insight into the fate(s ) of satellite stars .",
    "the models presented herein combine a simple prescription for relating galaxies to dark matter halos at @xmath10 with the assembly history of these halos extracted from @xmath1-body simulations in order to follow the dissipationless growth of massive galaxies to @xmath2 .",
    "the relation between galaxies and halos at @xmath10 is generated by assigning the most massive galaxies to the most massive halos monotonically .",
    "this has been shown to successfully reproduce a wide variety of observations @xcite .",
    "note that this model considers both subhalos , which are halos contained within the virial radii larger halos , and what we will call distinct halos , which are halos not contained within the virial radii of larger halos .",
    "we follow the dynamical evolution of subhalos after they accrete onto their host halo using merger trees extracted directly from cosmological simulations , rather than a semi - analytic model .",
    "semi - analytic models ( sams ) for the formation and evolution of galaxies within a cosmological context , depending on the adopted assumptions about galaxy formation physics , are capable of predicting both strong @xcite and mild @xcite evolution in the number density of massive galaxies since @xmath10 .",
    "the most massive galaxies in many of these models have formed the bulk of their stars at @xmath9 , in agreement with observations .",
    "hence differences between these models are due primarily to different treatments of the assembly history of the massive galaxies .",
    "our approach is similar in spirit to that of a recent study by @xcite who used a sam to follow the evolution of galaxies .",
    "these authors artificially turned off star formation at @xmath12 in order to follow the dissipationless growth of galaxies at late times , similar to what we do here .",
    "the orbital evolution of satellites in their sam was computed with simple analytical approximations to dynamical friction , tidal heading and tidal stripping .",
    "@xcite showed that the observed evolution in the space density of massive galaxies is reproduced in their model only if they allow for @xmath18% of stars from disrupted satellites to be transfered into the icl .",
    "the present work goes further than the study of @xcite by 1 ) using an independent set of simulations with satellite tracks extracted directly from the simulations and 2 ) comparing to a wider array of observations and hence providing more general constraints on the fates of the stars within satellite galaxies .",
    "the rest of this article unfolds as follows . in @xmath19[s : sims ] we describe the simulations , halos catalogs and merger trees used in this analysis .",

    "the power spectra used to generate the initial conditions for the simulations were determined from a direct boltzmann code calculation ( courtesy of wayne hu ) .",
    "we use a power spectrum normalization of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the rms fluctuation in spheres of @xmath30 mpc comoving radius .",
    "the simulation used herein was run in a box of length @xmath31 @xmath32 mpc with particle mass @xmath33 @xmath32 @xmath34 , peak force resolution of @xmath35 @xmath32 kpc , and @xmath36 particles .",
    "we have checked that our results remain unchanged when utilizing a smaller box with smaller particle mass ( a box of length @xmath37 @xmath32 mpc with particle mass @xmath38 @xmath32 @xmath34 ) .    from this simulation",
    "we generate dark matter halo catalogs and dark matter halo merger trees .",
    "our models rely not only on distinct halos , i.e. , halos with centers that do not lie within any larger virialized system , but also subhalos , which are located with the virial radii of larger systems . when we refer to a `` halo '' generically we mean both distinct halos and subhalos .",
    "distinct halos and subhalos are identified using a variant of the bound density maxima ( bdm ) halo finding algorithm @xcite .",
    "details of the algorithm and parameters used can be found in @xcite ; we briefly summarize the main steps here .",
    "all particles are assigned a density using the ` smooth ` algorithm which uses a symmetric sph smoothing kernel on the @xmath39 nearest neighbors . starting with the highest overdensity particle",
    ", we surround each potential center by a sphere of radius @xmath40 kpc and exclude all particles within this sphere from further search .",
    "hence no two halos can be separated by less than @xmath41 .",
    "we then construct density , circular velocity , and velocity dispersion profiles around each center , iteratively removing unbound particles as described in @xcite .",
    "once unbound particles have been removed , we measure quantities such as @xmath42 , the maximum circular velocity of the halo . for each distinct halo",
    "we calculate the virial radius , defined as the radius enclosing overdensity of @xmath43 with respect to the _ mean _ density of the universe at the epoch of the output .",
    "we use this virial radius to classify objects into distinct halos and subhalos .",
    "the halo catalogs are complete for halos with more than @xmath44 particles , which corresponds , for the box with length @xmath31 @xmath32 mpc , to @xmath45 .",
    "halo merger trees have also been constructed for this simulation ( for a detailed description of the merger tree construction , see * ? ? ?",
    "these merger trees allow us to tabulate @xmath46 for subhalos , the virial mass at the time when a subhalo first crosses the virial radius of a distinct halo .",
    "since subhalos are subject to dynamical processes such as tidal stripping , @xmath46 will always be greater than or equal to the present @xmath47 .",
    "this accretion epoch quantity is used in our models , to which we now turn .",
    "recent studies have shown that models in which galaxies are associated with the centers of dark matter halos and subhalos accurately reproduce a wide variety of observations both at low and high redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "herein , stellar mass is assigned to each halo in a simulation by assuming a monotonic relation between stellar mass and halo virial mass using the observed galaxy stellar mass function ( gsmf ) and halo mass function measured in simulations : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the number density of galaxies and halos ( note again that `` halos '' here and throughout refers to both distinct halos and their subhalos ) , respectively .",
    "galaxy stellar masses can hence be assigned to halos at any epoch once the gsmf at that epoch is known . in the simplest version of this scheme",
    "there is assumed to be no scatter in the relation between halo mass and stellar mass ( see @xmath19[s : robust ] for a discussion of scatter in the context of our models ) .",
    "subhalos lose mass due to tidal stripping as they orbit within their parent halo .",
    "since stripping primarily affects the outer regions of the subhalo , we expect the galaxy , which resides within the inner few kpc of the subhalo , to be relatively unaffected by this process . hence , for subhalos , when relating halo mass to luminosity or stellar mass we use its virial mass at the epoch when it is first accreted onto the parent halo , @xmath46 , rather than its mass at the epoch of observation",
    ". this choice is well motivated both by hydrodynamical simulations @xcite and detailed modeling of the small to intermediate scale ( @xmath51 @xmath32 mpc ) clustering of galaxies over a range of redshifts @xcite .",
    "one may ask to what extent it is justifiable to identify satellite galaxies with subhalos in dissipationless simulations .",
    "it has been shown that the subhalo population in dissipationless simulations is indeed quite similar to the galaxy population in hydrodynamical simulations @xcite and semi - analytic models @xcite .",
    "in particular , satellite populations in these hydrodynamical simulations with cooling and galaxy formation have an almost identical halo occupation distribution to the subhalos in dissipationless simulations .",
    "these conclusions are corroborated by the general success of the subhalo - based models of galaxy clustering .",
    "this model , for example , accurately captures observed relations between cluster luminosity and the number of galaxies within a cluster as a function of cluster mass @xcite , the luminosity dependence of the galaxy - matter cross - correlation function ( after a reasonable amount of scatter is introduced into this relation ; see * ? ? ? * for details ) , close pair counts @xcite , the luminosity , scale , and redshift - dependence of the galaxy autocorrelation function from @xmath52 to @xmath2 @xcite , and mass - to - light ratios in local clusters @xcite .",
    "emboldened by the success of this simple model , in the present work we extend it by populating halos with galaxies at @xmath10 in the above way and then using halo merger trees derived from @xmath1-body simulations to follow the evolution of these galaxies to @xmath2 .",
    "specifically , we use the observed galaxy stellar mass function ( gsmf ) of @xcite at @xmath10 to assign stellar masses to halos , and then follow the _ dissipationless _ evolution of these galaxies via the merging history of their dark matter halos to @xmath2 .",
    "this exercise is appropriate for the evolution of the most massive galaxies , as these galaxies formed the bulk of their stars at @xmath9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hence largely evolve dissipationlessly at @xmath12 . note that neglecting star formation at @xmath12 means that the evolution of the total stellar mass predicted by our models is a lower limit on the actual evolution .",
    "the following @xmath0 gsmf schechter parameters are adopted from @xcite : @xmath53 the @xmath54 errors quoted above are not the statistical errors reported in @xcite but are instead meant to roughly encompass the various published estimates of the @xmath0 gsmf schechter parameters .",
    "the statistical errors are a factor of @xmath55 smaller than these approximate systematic errors . here and throughout the chabrier imf is used when quoting stellar masses .",
    "it is important to note that while different authors derive somewhat different schechter parameters for the @xmath10 gsmf , all authors agree that the massive end of the gsmf ( @xmath56 ) evolves very little , if at all , since @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , while several measurements of the gsmf at @xmath10 have relied on photometric redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the general conclusions from these studies have been supported by measurements which utilize spectroscopic redshifts @xcite .",
    "figure [ f : obs ] presents a comparison between various observed gsmfs at @xmath10 and the @xmath2 gsmf from @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath10 gsmf used in our models @xcite is below all the other @xmath10 gsmfs .",
    "this implies that our results concerning the @xmath57 brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) luminosities derived with this gsmf will be lower bounds relative to the other gsmfs .    at @xmath0 ,",

    "are subhalos at @xmath2 . finally , note that although we formally assign stellar mass to all the halos found in the simulations and track their evolution as described in the following section , our results are quite insensitive to low mass halos and are instead governed by the evolution and fate of much more massive halos . since it is these halos that are most easily resolved and tracked from timestep to timestep , we expect our results to be insensitive to our simulation resolution .",
    "[ f : obs ]      our model contains ( at least ) three adjustable components .",
    "the first is our assumed cosmology and will be fixed throughout , though we comment qualitatively on the effects of changing certain cosmological parameters in @xmath19[s : robust ] .",
    "the second component is our input method for assigning stellar masses to halos at @xmath10 . in @xmath19[s : robust ] we demonstrate that our results are robust to reasonable changes of this second component . in particular",
    ", we introduce scatter in the assignment between stellar mass and halo mass and marginalize over the uncertainties in the @xmath10 gsmf and find no qualitative change to our conclusions , provided that the true gsmf is not considerably different from recent estimates .",
    "the third adjustable component is the most uncertain and concerns how we treat subhalos that have dropped out of the halo catalog .",
    "this can occur either because the subhalo is physically disrupted or because it is stripped below the resolution limit of the simulation ; it is often quite difficult to distinguish these two cases within the simulation .",
    "we do nothing to the galaxies assigned to subhalos while the subhalos remain identifiable in our simulation  i.e. , the satellite galaxy within the subhalo experiences no tidal stripping .",
    "once a subhalo is destroyed , we are free to redistribute the stars from this subhalo in one or more of the ways outlined in the introduction . to summarize that discussion : the stars can be deposited onto the central galaxy ( this assumes that the satellite within the destroyed subhalo has merged with the central galaxy ) , can remain as a satellite galaxy without an identifiable subhalo , and/or the stars can be added to the intra - cluster light ( icl ) . in the latter case",
    "the stars are added to the outer regions of the central galaxy , beyond the optical radius ( the radius within which the central galaxy luminosity is measured ) .    in order to explore these possibilities ,",
    "four models are constructed which differ only in the fate of the stars within disrupted subhalos . model _",
    "sat2cen _ assumes that all of the stars are deposited onto the central galaxy .",
    "conversely , model _ keepsat _ assumes that the stars remain bound as a satellite galaxy .",
    "sat2icl _ assumes that all stars are deposited into the icl .",
    "finally , model _",
    "sat2cen+icl _ assumes that the stars are distributed equally between the icl and the central galaxy .",
    "we will assume below , when comparing to observations of the icl , that the icl in these models is generated predominantly from the remnants of mergers with the central galaxy at @xmath12 .",
    "these assumptions are motivated by hydrodynamical simulations of clusters @xcite which showed that the majority of the icl is built up at @xmath12 from major mergers with the central galaxy , rather than tidal stripping as the satellite orbits in the cluster . for reference ,",
    "these models are summarized in table [ t : models ] .",
    "these models have implicitly assumed that all stellar mass at @xmath0 persists to @xmath57 . however , stellar mass - loss due to winds and supernovae can result in a significant decrease in the aggregate stellar mass of a population over time . in order to understand these effects ,",
    "consider a secular mass - loss rate of @xmath63 for a stellar population formed in an instantaneous burst and older than a few hundred myr @xcite .",
    "if massive red galaxies grew most of their stellar mass in the form of a single burst at @xmath64 , then the fraction of stellar mass lost between @xmath0 and @xmath57 is only @xmath65% ; however , if the stars in these galaxies all formed at @xmath0 then the fraction is @xmath66% .",
    "since observations place the epoch of star - formation in these massive galaxies at @xmath67 , mass - loss effects are likely unimportant .",

    "these colors are appropriate for the bright end of the red sequence @xcite .",
    "all the results to be discussed below are independent of our assumed imf because we are only interested in relative evolution from @xmath0 to @xmath57 .",
    "thus , so long as the observations at these epochs use the same imf , the results are insensitive to the particular imf used ( whether for example chabrier , kroupa , or salpeter imfs are used ) . results which concern luminosities are also imf independent so long as we use a mass - to - light ratio with the same imf as used in our gsmfs ( as we have done above ) .",
    "the luminosities of galaxies at @xmath2 in these models are strictly lower bounds for two reasons : 1 ) these models neglect star - formation since @xmath0 , and 2 ) some galaxies might not be as red as the colors assumed in the previous paragraph , and hence they will be brighter at a fixed stellar mass .",
    "for the massive bcgs studied herein however , these effects are unimportant",
    ". it will become apparent in the next section that including these possibilities would only strengthen our general conclusions since both residual star - formation and bluer colors would increase the bcg luminosities and the evolution of the massive end of the gsmf .",
    "we also assume that the icl has the same color as the tip of the red sequence when converting icl stellar mass to luminosities .",
    "such an assumption appears borne out by observations of an at most weak color gradient out to several hundred kpc from the bcg , with some authors finding a slight reddening @xcite and others a slightly bluer color , or no gradient at all @xcite .",

    "the effect can be as large as 1 magnitude , though in such cases it appears that the icl is included as part of the bcg .",
    "our results are robust against these effects because our notion of a bcg is precisely that measured by the data to which we compare ( i.e. by * ? ? ?",

    "unfortunately , this means that our results which rely on the separation between the bcg and icl are not directly exportable to other observations of the bcg and icl if such observations separate these two observables in different ways . as mentioned previously , a more robust approach to this type of modeling would be to present actual surface brightness _",

    "in addition , we include lines that indicate the amount of stellar mass a galaxy would have if its halo contained the cosmic mean baryon - to - dark matter ratio , @xmath111 , and it converted a fraction @xmath112 of those baryons into stars ( @xmath112 is often called the star - formation efficiency ) .",
    "comparison between the scatter prescription and the lines of constant star - formation efficiency indicate why this prescription is extreme  there are galaxies which have @xmath113 and indeed some rare cases where the baryon fraction in the halo exceeds @xmath114 . at @xmath2",

    "there would also be more evolution in the abundance of massive halos between @xmath0 and @xmath57 , as halo formation times would be shifted to more recent time .",
    "this would imply that the amount of evolution would be larger and our conclusions would be stronger in a lower @xmath29 universe .",
    "however , later formation times also imply that there would be less time for accreting halos to merge and contribute to the growth of the bcg stellar mass .",
    "the relative importance of these competing effects will have to be quantified in a future analysis similar to the one presented here with simulations of lower @xmath29 .",
    "we have explored four models for the dissipationless evolution of galaxies since @xmath0 .",

    "we have found that only a model in which a significant fraction of stars ( @xmath3% ) from disrupted subhalos are transfered to the icl ( referred to as model _ sat2icl _ above ) is consistent with data .",
    "the failure of the other models provides significant insight into the dissipationless evolution of galaxies .    a model in which all the stars from disrupted subhalos are transfered to the central galaxy ( model _ sat2cen _ )",
    "is strongly ruled out both by observations of the evolution in the gsmf and observations of the @xmath57 @xmath116 relation .",
    "such a model would only be viable if the observed gsmf at @xmath10 were significantly revised downward from the current lowest reported measurements .",
    "the failure of such a model implies that , if stars from disrupted subhalos are transfered to the central galaxy , then they can not be put in the central regions where bcg luminosities are measured .",
    "such a conclusion is corroborated by simulations of dissipationless ( `` dry '' ) galaxy - galaxy mergers , which find that the resulting galaxy generally becomes more extended rather than substantially brighter at the center ( e.g. * ? ? ? * although this conclusion depends on the orbital parameters of the accreted satellite ) .",
    "we have also explored an extreme model where satellites never disrupt even when their subhalos do ( model _ keepsat _ ) .",
    "this model fails dramatically when compared to observations of the combined luminosity of the bcg and icl , under the assumption that the icl is built - up predominantly at @xmath12 .",
    "although this assumption appears justified in light of recent hydrodynamical simulations , one should note that our conclusion as regards model _ keepsat _ relies on this assumption . in our models",
    "the massive subhalos correspond to massive satellites and it is the fate of these massive satellites that most strongly affects the comparison to observations of the combined luminosities of the bcg and icl .",
    "the failure of this model thus strongly suggests that the disruption of subhalos in our high - resolution @xmath1-body simulations corresponds to the disruption of satellite galaxies , at least for the most massive subhalos .",
    "this need not have been the case ; recent semi - analytic models ( sams ) have decoupled the dynamical evolution of subhalos from satellites when the subhalo disrupts @xcite , and hence these models produce a significant population of satellites with no identifiable subhalo ( the so - called `` orphan '' population ) .",
    "the failure of model _ keepsat _ strongly suggests that in fact satellites disrupt when their subhalo disrupts , at least for massive satellites , and hence any model ( including the sams mentioned above ) which fails to tie the fates of massive satellites to their subhalos will likely fail to reproduce the observed combined luminosities of the bcg and icl .",
    "moreover , the failure of model _ keepsat _ provides additional justification for previous modeling where a one - to - one relation between galaxies and halos extracted from @xmath1-body simulations has been assumed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the data instead favor models where most , if not all , of the stars from disrupted satellites are deposited into the icl .",
    "sat2icl _ puts all stars from disrupted satellites into the icl while model _",
    "sat2cen+icl _ puts only half into the icl and the rest onto the bcg .",
    "although comparisons with various observations favor model _",
    "sat2icl _ , the uncertainties and assumptions discussed in previous sections suggest that reality may lie somewhere in between these two models .",
    "the strongest discriminant between these scenarios is the fraction of bcg+icl light contained in the icl ; as elsewhere , model _",
    "sat2icl _ most faithfully reproduces these observations .",
    "there is a growing consensus that massive red galaxies were more or less in place by @xmath10 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at first glance",
    "it appears difficult to reconcile this fact with @xmath8cdm simulations which show that massive dark matter halos ( the very halos in which these massive galaxies likely reside ) grow by factors of @xmath126 since @xmath0 . the success of model _",
    "sat2icl _ resolves this tension by `` hiding '' the accreted stars in the icl .",
    "observations of the evolution of the icl at @xmath12 will be needed to substantiate this picture .    the success of model _",
    "sat2icl _ provides us with further insight into the nature of the icl .",

    "is this consistent with model _ sat2icl _",
    ", where the icl is built up by mergers with the bcg at @xmath12 ?",
    "the answer to this question is most likely yes , because the subhalos that are disrupting at @xmath12 were accreted onto the host halo at @xmath10 ( the average accretion epoch , weighted by the fraction of stellar mass brought in by the subhalo is @xmath127 ) . in other words ,",
    "the galaxies that are contributing stars to the icl at late times were part of the main halo at @xmath10 and hence could reasonably have had their star formation truncated by one or more cluster - specific processes ( e.g. ram pressure stripping or harassment ) by @xmath10 .",
    "thus these galaxies would be adding primarily old red stars to the icl when they disrupt .",
    "there are several other observables which can provide additional tests of these models .",
    "specifically , the number of galaxies , @xmath128 , and the total cluster luminosity , @xmath129 , both a function of cluster virial mass , provide independent constraints compared to the observations explored herein . however , these two observables are much more sensitive to star formation since @xmath0 ( because they include lower mass galaxies ) , which has been neglected in these models .",
    "hence in the present work we have not not included a comparison to these observables because such a comparison would require additional , less constrained assumptions .",
    "semi - analytic models governing the formation and evolution of galaxies have proven capable of reproducing both strong and mild evolution of massive galaxies since @xmath0 .",
    "the models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kw06 ) and @xcite produce relatively mild evolution in the massive end of the gsmf , although kw06 appear to over - predict the abundance of massive galaxies at @xmath57 .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite and @xcite use a semi - analytic model very similar to that used in kw06 and found that massive galaxies roughly double in stellar mass since @xmath0 .",
    "this doubling in stellar mass does not strongly affect the evolution in the gsmf presented in kw06 because these authors assume @xmath130  dex uncertainty in the observed stellar mass estimates at @xmath131 .",
    "this assumed uncertainty , which is likely an upper bound , increases the model gsmf at the massive end for @xmath131 , and hence masks the stronger intrinsic evolution in the model .",
    "none of these models attempt to model the icl , and all are quite sensitive to their treatment of the merging of satellite galaxies ( the various possible treatments are not explored in these models ) as well as an array of model parameters . for these reasons",
    "it is difficult to draw general conclusions from these models .",
    "our approach most closely parallels that of @xcite who used a semi - analytic model to follow the evolution of the gsmf .",
    "these authors artificially turned off their star - formation prescription in order to follow the dissipationless growth of galaxies since @xmath0 , similar to what we do here . when a satellite merges with a central galaxy , they transfer a fraction , @xmath132 , of the satellites stars to the icl .",
    "they found that @xmath133 resulted in evolution in the gsmf in agreement with observations .",
    "several models presented in the present work are closely related to the scheme employed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , our models _ sat2cen _ , _ sat2cen+icl _ , and _",
    "sat2icl _ are similar to their model with @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively% of the stars in the icl came from the tidal stripping of satellite galaxies  a process which we have ignored in the present work . ] . in @xmath19[s :",
    "evgsmf ] we showed that models _",
    "sat2cen+icl _ and _ sat2icl _ were indeed in agreement with the observed evolution of the gsmf while model _",
    "sat2cen _ was not , similar to the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "however , in @xmath19[s : bcg ] and @xmath19[s : icl ] we showed that model _",
    "sat2cen+icl _ overproduced bcg luminosities at @xmath57 and underproduced the fraction of combined bcg and icl light contained in the icl , while model _",
    "sat2icl _ successfully reproduced both of these observations .",
    "we hence expect that the model presented in @xcite would reproduce these latter two observations only if they used @xmath137 .",
    "comparing models to bcg luminosities and icl fractions vs. cluster virial mass provides unique constraints relative to evolution in the gsmf because these two observables directly probe the properties of the most massive systems , while the high mass end of the gsmf is sensitive to poisson uncertainty and cosmic variance .",
    "each of the models presented herein make predictions for the disruption rate of satellite galaxies .",
    "@xcite used the redshift - dependent clustering of galaxies from @xmath16 to @xmath17 to constrain the disruption rate of satellite galaxies . over this time interval",
    ", these authors found that at least @xmath138 satellites brighter than @xmath139 per massive halo were disrupted . when focusing on satellites comparable to those in white et al .",
    ", we find on average @xmath140 satellites within massive halos have disrupted between @xmath0 and @xmath141 ( for models other than model _ keepsat _ , since in that model satellites never disrupt ) .",
    "agreement between these results provides a satisfying cross - check for both approaches . on the one hand",
    ", we follow directly the evolution of subhalos in simulations and hence have useful information regarding their disruption .",
    "conversely , white et al .",
    "rely primarily on evolution of the observed clustering of galaxies to constrain the disruption rate , and hence make no assumptions regarding the relation between subhalos and satellites . when combined , these results provide further weight to the idea that , over the mass ranges explored herein , disrupted subhalos correspond to disrupted satellite galaxies .",
    "most recently , @xcite have modeled the build - up of the icl by tracing the fate of satellites in dark matter merger trees generated from the extended press - schechter formalism combined with a detailed prescription for satellite stripping @xcite .",
    "this dark matter treatment is coupled with a simple stellar mass - dark matter halo correspondence at @xmath57 and a simple prescription for star - formation .",
    "the icl in their model is built up from disrupted satellites ; with a reasonable threshold for subhalo disruption , these authors found trends similar to those reported here ( since their merger trees are based on analytic prescriptions , they were able to extend their analysis to halos at considerably lower mass then explored herein ) .",
    "in particular , they found that the fraction of bcg+icl light contained in the icl in massive halos is considerable and in agreement with the observations of @xcite .",
    "the agreement between their scheme and ours is encouraging given the substantial differences in the detailed treatment .",
    "in this paper we investigated models for the dissipationless buildup of massive central galaxies and the intracluster light , in the context of merging histories for dark matter halos in high resolution simulations of the currently favored @xmath8cdm model .",
    "we used a simple model for associating galaxies with dark matter halos and subhalos at @xmath0 , using the observed galaxy stellar mass function and the mass function for halos and subhalos measured in simulations .",
    "the dissipationless evolution of galaxies in this model was tracked with the merging history of the dark matter halos extracted from simulations .",
    "we then confronted this model with data on the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and with the amount and fraction of cluster light that is in brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) and in the icl at @xmath57 , investigating where the predictions from variations in the fate of stars in merging galaxies could be distinguished .",
    "we found that our model accurately reproduces a variety of observed properties at @xmath57 if disrupted subhalos deposit most of their stars into the intracluster light ( icl ) .",
    "other scenarios , either those in which most of the stars are deposited onto the central bcg or in which stars from disrupted halos are left behind as satellite galaxies , are strongly disfavored by the data .",
    "such a scenario suggests that , while bcgs do not appear to evolve strongly at @xmath12 , the icl surrounding such galaxies is growing substantially over this epoch .",
    "this scenario is corroborated by high - resolution dissipationless simulations of galaxy - galaxy mergers @xcite which find that disrupted satellites preferentially build - up the outer envelope of massive galaxies .",
    "although ideally one should distinguish between light bound to galaxies and light that is dynamically bound only to the main halo , it is worth noting that our analysis does not explicitly distinguish between the outer parts of bright or cd galaxies and the icl . for the purposes of this work `` bcg '' refers to that part of the central galaxy",
    "s light that is captured in standard survey photometry , operationally defined for most of the comparisons herein as light above a surface brightness cut of @xmath4 mag arcsec@xmath5 , while `` icl '' refers to all cluster light that is not contained in galaxies using these measurements . further work both on the theoretical and observation side is needed to refine this distinction , and care should be taken when comparing various studies , as there is a wide variation in choices made for these definitions .",
    "we emphasize that models for the formation and evolution of galaxies must be seriously confronted with observations of the icl , in addition to more conventional observations such as the gsmf and the two - point correlation function .",
    "the icl contains a significant , if still somewhat uncertain , amount of stellar mass , and models which ignore this component will either place too much stellar mass in resolved galaxies or will fail to produce enough stars globally .",
    "the success of this simple model lends weight to earlier implications from clustering statistics that the resolution of the current generation of @xmath1-body simulations is sufficient to resolve the bulk of subhalos that correspond to observed satellite galaxies in clusters .",

    "<S> we use a set of simulation - based models for the dissipationless evolution of galaxies since @xmath0 to constrain the fate of accreted satellites embedded in dark matter subhalos . </S>",
    "<S> these models assign stellar mass to dark matter halos at @xmath0 by relating the observed galaxy stellar mass function ( gsmf ) to the halo+subhalo mass function monotonically . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the stellar mass content is then followed using halo merger trees extracted from @xmath1-body simulations . </S>",
    "<S> our models are differentiated only in the fate assigned to satellite galaxies once subhalos , within which satellites are embedded , disrupt . </S>",
    "<S> these models are confronted with the observed evolution in the massive end of the gsmf , the @xmath2 brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg)-cluster mass relation , and the combined bcg and intracluster light ( icl ) luminosity distribution  all observables expected to evolve approximately dissipationlessly since @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the combined observational constraints favor a model in which the vast majority ( @xmath3% ) of satellite stars from disrupted subhalos go into the icl ( operationally defined here as light below a surface brightness cut of @xmath4 mag arcsec@xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , models that leave behind a significant population of satellite galaxies once the subhalo has disrupted are strongly disfavored , as are models that put a significant fraction of satellite stars into the bcg . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that observations of the icl provide useful and unique constraints on models of galaxy merging and the dissipationless evolution of galaxies in groups and clusters . </S>"
