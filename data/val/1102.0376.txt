    "vibrational excitations in many fermion systems , in other terms , phonons , are made up by coherent superposition of particle - hole or two quasiparticle excitations .",

    "there is no general rule of the correspondence between these two bands in the signature scheme and the @xmath104 bands in the @xmath30 scheme .",
    "however , since states with the lower @xmath30 have lower intrinsic energies than those with higher @xmath30 and the same @xmath105 , the obtained lower band can be identified with the @xmath106 band .",
    "actually , in the previous analysis of the @xmath66 intensity relation  @xcite , correspondence between the observed and the calculated states was established in this manner .",
    "the present result indicates that collectivity does not fragment much and two bands are almost parallel as in the @xmath107ho case  @xcite .",
    "but the higher band is slightly more collective and purer . this is consistent with the observation at @xmath83 that states with lower @xmath30 are affected more by interaction with other states  @xcite .",
    "actually only the @xmath74 sequence was observed in many cases .",
    "fragmentation of the 2@xmath0 components is expected to depend sensitively on how other quasiparticle states distribute . in the present calculation",
    ", the 2@xmath0 strength concentrates mainly on three eigenstates that locate at @xmath108 .",

    "the higher @xmath30 states are the more collective as expected . but",
    "small rotation immediately mixes their collectivity . then three collective bands run keeping almost the same collectivity .    in order to see how these collective states interact with other non - collective states , all the eigenstates of @xmath92 that locate lower than 3 mev",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) . at @xmath83 , there are 2nd ",
    "4th @xmath114 1qp states between the 1@xmath0s and 2@xmath0s .",
    "these are expected to correspond to some of the levels that were known to be populated by the @xmath2zr @xmath87 decay but spin and parity have not been assigned  @xcite .",
    "one of them interacts with the 2@xmath0s depending on @xmath24 . aside from this , the 2@xmath0s keep their collective characters as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    next",
    "the obtained collective states are compared with observed ones in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "this figure shows that the 1qp and the 1@xmath0 ( @xmath74 ) are reproduced almost perfectly . on the other hand ,",
    "the calculated 2@xmath0s obviously locate higher than the observed one .",
    "the most probable reason of this is ignoring higher lying states , that is , their effect to push down the 2@xmath0 states .",
    "although one may be afraid that inclusion of more states would lead to fragmentation of collectivity , we expect this not to occur since the number of nearby states is still small .    here",
    "we discuss the adopted triaxial deformation @xmath0 in ref .",
    "@xcite and the present calculation .",
    "it has two physical aspects , its sign and its absolute value .",
    "the former is originally the notion in the rotating mean field model .",
    "although the projection model in its original framework does not distinguish the sign of @xmath0 to our knowledge , ref .",
    "@xcite proposed a method to find the main rotation axis .",
    "this made it possible to relate the result of the projection calculation to the sign of @xmath0 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the adopted @xmath115 and @xmath116 correspond to @xmath117 .",
    "although its sign is not described , odd-@xmath1 nuclei with an @xmath118 odd nucleon show @xmath119 rotation due to its shape driving effect in addition to the approximately irrotational property of the even - even core in general . then we regard the sign is consistent with ours . as for the latter , its absolute value",
    ", the origin of the difference is that of the generating mechanism of the @xmath0 band itself as pointed out in ref .",
    "it is constructed as a vibrational phonon excitation built on top of the yrast configuration in our model .",
    "in contrast , in the projection model , it is generated as a rotational excitation in the sense of the asymmetric rotor .",
    "consequently appropriate @xmath0 deformation is not necessarily the same .",
    "the latter calls for a larger @xmath120 ; for example , @xmath121 was adopted for @xmath5er  @xcite , which is regarded as a typical axially symmetric nucleus  @xcite .",
    "note here that large fluctuations in the @xmath0 direction were shown for nuclei of that class , for example , in ref .",
    "these results indicate that the model dependence of the adopted value of @xmath0 deformation is not unphysical .",
    "it is an interesting subject to look into more this longstanding problem of how these two , vibrational / rotational , descriptions are related , but it is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "last but not least , we mention another type of collective motion for which two phonon excitation was observed , the wobbling motion predicted by bohr and mottelson  @xcite , janssen and mikhailov  @xcite and marshalek  @xcite , and first observed by degrd et al .  @xcite .",
    "this is a small amplitude fluctuation of the rotation axis of triaxially deformed nuclei and has the same quantum number , @xmath122 , as the odd spin members of the @xmath0 vibrational bands .",
    "two phonon wobbling bands were observed in @xmath123lu by jensen et al .",
    "@xcite and @xmath107lu by schnwaer et al .",
    "their excitation energies in the rotating frame exhibit anharmonicity such that the two phonon states locate lower than the twice the energies of the one phonon states .",
    "the present author and ohtsubo  @xcite argued that this anharmonicity indicates the softening of the collective potential surface , that is , the precursor of the second order phase transition from the principal axis rotation to the tilted axis rotation .",
    "this is completely parallel with the situation that the softening of the @xmath0 vibration is the precursor of the second order phase transition from the axial symmetric deformation to static triaxial deformation . the new vacuum after the phase transition can accommodate anharmonic vibration either @xmath124 or @xmath125 .",
    "compare the potential energy surfaces : fig.3 in the first item of ref .",
    "@xcite and fig.3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ; in general , stiff potentials as the former lead to high @xmath126 ratios while soft ones as the latter do low ratios .    to summarize , two phonon @xmath0 vibrational bands in rotating odd-@xmath1 nuclei were observed recently in three nuclides  @xcite . after these observation , the first theoretical calculation by means of the triaxial projected shell model to one of them",
    "was reported  @xcite . in the present paper , we have applied to the same nuclide a completely different , mean field based model , which was previously developed for the signature dependent properties of one quasiparticle ( zero phonon ) bands and later utilized for the @xmath66 intensity relations in one phonon bands . in the present calculation , after confirming almost perfect reproduction of the zero and one phonon states , we concentrated on the effect of the odd quasiparticle on the distribution of the two phonon collectivity .",
    "the obtained @xmath3 state is almost pure at @xmath83 , but small rotation immediately delivers the strength to two other sequences ; consequently three collective sequences keep about 60% collectivity up to higher spins .",
    "this indicates future experimental observation of more than one sequence of the 2@xmath0 bands as well as the other sequence of the 1@xmath0 .",
    "the restriction of the model space mentioned above would be the reason of the result that the calculated 2@xmath0 states locate higher than observed .",
    "there are some to improve the present calculation : first of all , the model space should be enlarged to more than two phonon states .",
    "further , extension of the microscopic approach by means of the selfconsistent collective coordinate method  @xcite to rotating even and odd-@xmath1 systems is promising in future ."
