    "quantum rings are two dimensional regions of annular shape where an electron is confined and possibly subject to an external field ( magnetic or electric ) ; as for the simply connected case studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , only few special cases may be solved exactly , such as for the circular annulus , where the solutions may be expressed in terms of bessel functions of first and second kind .",
    "however , quantum rings of general shape , for which exact solutions are not known , present interesting physical behaviors , thus justifying the effort of finding analytical or numerical approximations .",
    "for instance , it is known that the bendings of an infinite wire cause the appearance of bound states below the continuum threshold  @xcite and of localized states in quantum rings in correspondence of regions of maximum curvature  @xcite . in particular , gridin and collaborators",
    "have formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite an asymptotic approximation to the modes of a quantum ring , based on the assumption that the ratio of the ring half - width to the radius of curvature is small .",
    "their approach extends to ring like domain the classical keller - rubinow method  @xcite    in this paper we adopt a completely different strategy , which is both systematic and simple , and which can be used to obtain precise analytical and/or numerical approximations for the energies and eigenfunctions of a given quantum ring .",
    "the approach that we propose is based on a generalization of the methods described in ref .",
    "@xcite and allows one to solve helmholtz equation for the quantum ring of arbitrary shape by conformally mapping the ring to a simply connected domain .",
    "the results obtained in this way are very precise and prove to be useful even for the exactly solvable circular ring : in this case we have found an extremely precise formula for the energies of the rings , which avoids the use of bessel functions and their zeroes .",
    "it is important to underline that the method that we propose is systematic and that it can be applied to rings of arbitrary width and curvature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we describe the numerical implementation of our method , using the conformal collocation method of @xcite ; in section [ sec3 ] we discuss the extension of the analytical techniques of @xcite to the case of annular domains ; in section [ sec4 ] we apply the methods , both analytical and numerical , to the solvable problem of a circular annulus and to the less tractable problem of a `` robnik s ring '' , i.e. a ring whose external border corresponds to the family of quantum billiards studied by robnik in @xcite and known as `` robnik s billiards '' . finally in section [ concl ] we summarize our results and draw our conclusions .",
    "in this section we describe the application of the conformal collocation method ( ccm ) of ref .",
    "@xcite to the solution of schrdinger equation in a quantum ring .",
    "although this approach has been already described in detail in those papers , we briefly review it here to make the discussion self - contained and to highlight the modifications which are needed to implement the specific problem at hand .",
    "our starting point is the homogeneous helmholtz equation on a `` ring - like '' domain @xmath1 , which can be conformally mapped to an inhomogeneous helmholtz equation on a `` simpler '' domain @xmath2 , which is assumed here to be a rectangle .",

    "in fact our approach provides a systematic tool for the study of the spectrum of quantum rings of arbitrary shape , not relying on specific assumptions concerning the shape or the width of the ring .",
    "clearly , the problem of finding the particular conformal map which sends the rectangle to a specific ring may be attacked numerically , when the explicit expression is unknown  @xcite .",
    "* numerical results obtained using the conformal collocation method ( ccm ) for a large number of levels ( @xmath0 ) ; the accuracy of these results has been verified using berry s approximants to estimate the geometrical features of the rings with a selected number of levels , calculated numerically ; * variational estimates for the ground state of a quantum ring ; * explicit analytical formulas for the whole spectrum of a quantum ring ; the relation of these formulas with weyl s law is also obtained in light of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite ;    we believe that the importance of our methods thus relies in the possibility of describing with precision both the low and high end of the spectrum of a quantum ring and on the possibility of improving this precision in a simple and sistematic fashion . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there are no other approaches in the literature which share these features .",
