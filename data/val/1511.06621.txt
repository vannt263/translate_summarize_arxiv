    "quantum entanglement is nowadays considered a central resource in the field of quantum information and computation @xcite .",
    "it is therefore crucial to be able to determine whether a quantum state is separable or entangled , which is provably a hard decision problem when it comes to mixed states . in the context of continuous - variable systems , such as bosonic modes or collective atomic spins ( in the limit of large ensembles ) ,",
    "a necessary criterion for the separability of any two - mode state has been derived by duan _",
    "_ @xcite and simon @xcite , which even turns into a necessary and sufficient criterion in the special case of gaussian states .",
    "this criterion results from translating to continuous - variable ( infinite - dimensional ) systems the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) condition , which had been established for finite - dimensional discrete systems @xcite . following the notation of duan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the criterion expresses that if a two - mode state is separable , then its so - called einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) variance complies with the inequality @xmath0 for any real ( nonzero ) @xmath1 , where the operators @xmath2 are functions of the quadratures components @xmath3 and @xmath4 of modes 1 and 2 .",
    "thus , if a state violates inequality ( [ delta ] ) for at least one value of @xmath1 , it is entangled    @xcite .",
    "simon s version of this criterion @xcite is based on expressing the partial transposition as a mirror reflection operation @xmath5 , which can be viewed as time reversal on mode 2 .",
    "the ppt criterion expresses that following such a reflection , any separable state remains physical ( its density operator is positive semi - definite ) .",
    "conversely , an entangled state will be detected if the corresponding reflected state is non - physical ( its density operator admits a negative eigenvalue ) .",
    "remarkably , this separability condition becomes necessary _ and _ sufficient in the case of gaussian states and can even be extended to ( @xmath6+@xmath7)-mode gaussian states @xcite .",
    "however , for any other state , this criterion may very often leave entanglement undetected .",
    "earlier work has aimed at improving the duan - simon separability criterion for arbitrary states .",
    "in particular , walborn _",
    "@xcite reported on a separability condition using shannon entropy , which was later extended by huang @xcite .",
    "shchukin and vogel @xcite also derived a hierarchy of inequalities involving higher - order moments of the quadrature components ( the previous criterion only depends on the first- and second - order moments ) . in the present work",
    ", we investigate an improvement of the duan - simon separability criterion that enables a stronger entanglement detection for non - gaussian two - mode states by taking into account an additional parameter , namely , the degree of gaussianity @xmath8 .",
    "it is natural to expect that a stronger criterion can be obtained with more information on the state , but the additional parameter should be chosen carefully .",
    "for example , the purity of the state is not a good candidate , since the duan - simon criterion is necessary and sufficient for every gaussian state of arbitrary purity .",
    "as we shall show , the degree of gaussianity @xmath8 is indeed a good choice .    in sec .",
    "ii we start by introducing the parameter @xmath8 and providing some of its useful properties ( more details are given in appendix a ) . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce a criterion for a better detection of entangled states employing this degree of gaussianity , thus improving the duan - simon criterion for non - gaussian states . in sec .",
    "iv , we provide explicit examples of entangled non - gaussian states that are left unnoticed by the duan - simon criterion , demonstrating the advantage of our criterion ( the analytical computation of parameter @xmath8 is detailed in appendix b ) .",
    "the examples are produced from non - gaussian states belonging both to the set of classical states ( with positive glauber p - function ) and to the set of genuinely quantum states ( fock states ) , reflecting the general applicability of our method .",
    "finally , we conclude and discuss possible extensions of our work in sec .",
    "gaussian states play a prominent role in continuous - variable quantum information @xcite .",
    "however , several protocols necessarily require the use of non - gaussian states , such as entanglement distillation @xcite or quantum error correction @xcite . with the increasing importance of non - gaussian states , the question of measuring",
    "the gaussian character of a state has naturally arisen .",
    "several gaussianity measures have been introduced ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but we find it more convenient here to use the degree of gaussianity @xmath8 introduced in @xcite .",
    "consider a two - mode state @xmath9 .",
    "its first- and second - order moments , denoted , respectively , by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are expressed from the vector of quadrature components @xmath12 .",
    "the elements of the coherent vector are given by @xmath13 , while the elements of the covariance matrix are defined as @xmath14 .",
    "we assume , with no loss of generality , that all states considered in the following have vanishing coherent vectors ( @xmath15 ) since first - order moments are irrelevant as far as entanglement detection is concerned .",
    "the degree of gaussianity @xmath8 of state @xmath9 is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gaussian state characterized by the covariance matrix @xmath11 of state @xmath9 .",
    "one may easily verify that @xmath18 for gaussian states ( note that the converse is not true , as shown in appendix  [ annexea ] ) .",
    "in addition , the degree of gaussianity @xmath8 is invariant under gaussian unitary transformations , transposition , and partial transposition .",
    "the proofs are provided in appendix  [ annexea ] .",
    "these properties are essential for the derivations in this work .",
    "we will also exploit the fact that the knowledge of @xmath8 gives a tighter bound in the uncertainty relations @xcite , which in turn translates into a stronger condition for detecting entanglement .",
    "let us investigate the separability of an arbitrary two - mode state @xmath9 . as mentioned earlier , the ppt criterion consists in verifying the physicality of the partially transposed state @xmath19 ( which must hold for any separable two - mode state ) .",
    "then , an entangled state @xmath9 will be detected if @xmath19 is not physical ( it exhibits a negative eigenvalue ) . applying a partial transposition ( acting on the second mode ) in state space is equivalent to a mirror reflection @xmath20 in phase space .",
    "thus , in order to detect entanglement , we need to check the physicality of @xmath19 in phase space , which can be achieved based on the symplectic eigenvalues of its covariance matrix .",
    "suppose that the two - mode state @xmath9 has a covariance matrix @xmath11 . according to the williamson theorem",
    ", there always exists a unitary transformation @xmath21 mapping the state @xmath9 onto @xmath22 such that the associated symplectic transformation @xmath23 maps @xmath11 onto @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the largest ( smallest ) symplectic eigenvalue of @xmath11 and @xmath26 is the @xmath27 identity matrix . note that if @xmath9 is a gaussian state , then @xmath22 is a tensor product of two thermal states ; otherwise @xmath22 is a two - mode non - gaussian state that has the same covariance matrix @xmath28 .",
    "the uncertainty principle implies that the inequality @xmath29 must be respected for any physical state @xcite .",
    "applying this condition to the partially transposed state @xmath19 , we understand that the entanglement of states @xmath9 is detected whenever the smallest symplectic eigenvalue of @xmath19 is strictly smaller than 1 , which is the core of the duan - simon criterion .",
    "let us now introduce our improved criterion . in order to detect the entanglement of state @xmath9",
    ", we apply a partial transposition on the second mode ( which may lead to an unphysical state ) followed by a symplectic transformation , which gives access to the symplectic eigenvalues @xmath30 of the partially transposed state @xmath19 .",

    "if it lies in the white ( upper ) zone , no conclusion can be made because the partially transposed state is physical .",
    "however , interestingly , if it lies in the blue ( intermediate ) zone , we detect entanglement which was otherwise unnoticed .",
    "we remark that , since partial transposition and symplectic transformation conserve the gaussian character of a state ( see appendix [ annexea ] ) , if @xmath9 is a gaussian state , then @xmath22 and the reduced states @xmath72 and @xmath39 are also gaussian .",
    "then @xmath73 , and we recover the ( necessary and sufficient ) duan - simon separability criterion for gaussian states , as expected .",
    "let us also mention that our criterion does not improve entanglement detection when the covariance matrix of @xmath9 is diagonal , since the partially transposed state then necessarily remains physical .",
    "for example , the `` noon '' states of the form @xmath74 have a diagonal covariance matrix for @xmath75 .",
    "thus , even though those states are always entangled , we can not do any better than the duan - simon criterion , and entanglement is undetected by our criterion .",
    "however , there exist many other interesting cases where our method is useful , as shown in the next section .",
    "in this section , we apply our criterion to two types of non - gaussian states .",
    "those examples have in common that entanglement is not detected on the sole basis of the covariance matrix ( using the duan - simon criterion ) , but is detected exploiting the degree of gaussianity .",
    "the first example uses non - gaussian states as generated by the circuit of fig .",
    "[ figure ] .",
    "the preparation of the states works as follows .",

    "both states are processed through a two - mode squeezer ( tms ) of parameter @xmath79 .",
    "note that if @xmath80 is a fock state @xmath53 , at this point of the circuit we have a photon - added epr state , which we know is always entangled ( its entanglement is monotonically increasing with @xmath81 ) @xcite . of course",
    ", if we have the vacuum on both modes , the resulting state is simply an epr state .",
    "the next step in the circuit consists in processing each mode of the state through two independent gaussian additive - noise channels @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the variance of the added noise on the first ( second ) mode is denoted by @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "this construction ensures that the resulting ( not necessarily gaussian ) state will always be physical provided @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "the state @xmath9 at the output of this circuit has a covariance matrix @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the third pauli matrix .",
    "note that this form for a covariance matrix is actually quite general .",
    "indeed , duan _ et al .",
    "_ have shown @xcite that any covariance matrix of a two - mode state can be transformed into the form @xmath91 by applying local linear unitary bogoliubov operations , i.e. , combinations of squeezing transformations and rotations .",
    "these operations do not influence the separability of the state , and are thus always allowed when studying entanglement .",
    "the covariance matrix ( [ gammaref ] ) depends on three parameters while the most general form ( [ covmat ] ) has only one additional parameter , which reflects that ( [ gammaref ] ) encompasses a wide class of two - mode gaussian states .",
    "the entanglement of the resulting state @xmath9 is now analyzed as depicted by the red box of fig .",
