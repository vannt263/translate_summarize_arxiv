    "the dynamics of frictional interfaces are crucial to many situations in mechanical engineering  @xcite , geosciences  @xcite or biology  @xcite . today , after decades of studies , the science of contacts under time - invariant loading conditions , _",
    "e.g. _ static contacts or steady sliding contacts  @xcite , has reached a high level of advancement which , in many instances , enables quantitative reproduction of global  @xcite or local  @xcite measurements .",
    "in contrast , the dynamics of contacts under rapidly evolving loads or during fast unstable motion like stick - slip  @xcite is far less understood . in particular , recent experiments on the transition from static to kinetic friction of side - driven poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) rough samples forming line contacts with a rough pmma substrate have revealed unexpected features  @xcite .",
    "the transition occurs through the fast ( comparable to the speed of sound ) propagation of micro - slip fronts through the contact  @xcite .",
    "it can also be preceded by a series of fronts that arrest before having ruptured the whole contact , thus denoted as precursors  @xcite .",
    "these results , which may have important implications for _ e.g. _ the study of earthquakes , have triggered an active modelling activity .",

    "@xcite , using a one - dimensional ( 1d ) spring - block model with a complex time - dependent friction law , produced three types of micro - slip front velocities , analogous to that observed in  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , using a 1d spring - block model with a simple amontons - coulomb ( ac ) friction law , showed that the length of precursors is modified when the external normal load is made asymmetric .",
    "scheibert and dysthe  @xcite , using a quasi - static 1d model with ac friction , showed how the increasing tangential load itself induces an increasing pressure asymmetry which influences the precursors series .",
    "due to the intrinsic limitations of 1d models , all these studies yielded only a qualitative agreement with experiments .",
    "very recently , trmborg _ et al",
    ". _ demonstrated , using a 2d spring - block model with ac friction , that quantitative agreement with the kinematics ( _ i.e. _ the properties of the states in which no micro - slip front is propagating ) of the experiments requires an accurate description of the interfacial stresses , and therefore the use of realistic boundary conditions on the sample  @xcite .",
    "compared to such a 2d model , the strongest advantage of 1d models is that their results are much easier to analyse and understand , so that they provide opportunities for theoretical approaches .",
    "they also require simpler implementation and lower computational power . in most situations ,",
    "in which very accurate results are not needed and/or a thorough qualitative understanding of the behaviour of the system is desired , 1d models are preferable . from the pioneering work of burridge and knopoff  @xcite , .",

    "summing up , three main limitations of the model by maegawa _",
    "have been identified : ( i ) the tangential force shows large oscillations , the wavelength of which is controlled by the lattice spacing , ( ii ) the number of all kinds of events is an increasing function of @xmath3 and ( iii ) the quantitative agreement with the @xmath72-curve between model and experiments is poor . in the following section ,",
    "we propose improvements of the model that contribute to overcome these limitations .",
    "resolution dependent oscillations are known to occur in burridge - knopoff - like models and more generally in dynamic rupture models involving ac friction at the interface between dissimilar elastic media  @xcite .",
    "classical ways to reduce them significantly are either to regularize the ac friction law ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) or to introduce a viscous damping in the system  @xcite .",
    "adopt the second approach .",
    "physically , such viscosity is a way to model the energy dissipation that any material undergoes during deformation .",
    "after knopoff and ni  @xcite , we consider the following form for the viscous force @xmath86 : @xmath87 which is a damping on the relative motion of neighbouring blocks .",
    "the equations of motion are then given by @xmath88    the tangential force @xmath89 is still defined as the sum of all forces on a block excepting the friction force , _",
    "i.e. _ now including @xmath86 .",
    "it remains to choose a reasonable value of the damping coefficient @xmath90 .    in app .",
    "[ sec : relativeviscousdampinginalinearchainofblocks ] , the value of @xmath90 for critical damping of waves of wavelength @xmath91 , corresponding to the cut - off wavelength , is calculated .",
    "the result is @xmath92 .",
    "it is also shown that the values of @xmath90 corresponding to critical damping of higher wavelength oscillations are always larger than @xmath93 .",
    "we want to damp out oscillations of wavelength @xmath91 , and using @xmath94 is then a possibility .",
    "however , waves of other wavelengths close to @xmath91 will also be highly damped , causing significant changes to the dynamics .",
    "since this is an undesirable effect , a compromise has to be made .",
    "as suggested in  @xcite , the value @xmath95 is used in the following .",
    "note that since @xmath96 and @xmath97 , @xmath90 is @xmath3-independent for @xmath98 .",
    "figure [ fig : shearforceprofilewithvistosityamontonscoulombn=100 ] shows the tangential force distribution obtained when relative viscous damping is included .",
    "the improvement with respect to fig .",
    "[ fig : shearforceprofilenovistosityamontonscoulombn=100 ] is clear : the short wavelength oscillations have almost disappeared , resulting in a physically reasonable smooth tangential force profile . @xmath63",
    "also appears to be on average approximately equal to @xmath19 in ruptured regions , a fact that will be utilised below to predict the precursor lengths .",
    "normalised by the normal force @xmath56 on each block is plotted at three different times : at @xmath68 s , @xmath69 s , and at the arrest of the precursor of length @xmath70 from a simulation including the relative viscous damping and using @xmath64 , @xmath48 and @xmath99 .",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : shearforceprofilenovistosityamontonscoulombn=100 ] shows that lattice - controlled fluctuations have disappeared . ]    some small one- or two - node spikes remain .",
    "they have a different origin , as they are mainly caused by the discreteness of the friction law : at the tip of the rupture , one block is moving and therefore increasing the force on its neighbour , which is still stationary .",
    "the region beyond this stationary block is therefore not affected by the approaching rupture front , and a spike will therefore appear at the rupture front .",
    "spikes may also appear as an event arrests , also caused by one part of the interface slipping while another part is stuck .",
    "in all the following , the viscous damping introduced in this section will be used .      as discussed above , the model by maegawa _",
    "et al . _ exhibits an unphysical scaling with @xmath3 .",
    "it is possible to understand this scaling by considering how the system is tangentially loaded .",
    "as stated above , the driving force only acts on block @xmath44 . in order for an event to nucleate",
    ", this block has to reach its static friction threshold , which is proportional to the normal force : @xmath100 .",
    "since the added driving force per time is independent of @xmath3 , the time between two events will be proportional to @xmath101 , and the frequency of events consequently scales as @xmath3 , an argument which is fully consistent with fig .  [ fig : numberofeventsamontonscoulomb ] .",
    "the origin of the odd @xmath3- of the model by maegawa _",
    "et al . _ is therefore the decreasing size of the loading region as @xmath3 is increased .    in a physical system , like in the experiments by maegawa _",
    "_ , the loading region has a well defined spatial extension , which is a combination of various effects .",
    "first , the tangential loading is applied at the trailing edge of the slider at some effective height @xmath102 above the interface . as discussed experimentally in  @xcite and modelled in  @xcite",
    ", such a loading condition makes the tangential stress very high in the region near the trailing edge , the extension of which is of order @xmath102 .",
    "second , the interface between slider and base is not rigid .",
    "both surfaces are rough and the multi - contact layer between them has a finite tangential stiffness associated to the tangential deformation of the microasperities involved in the contact .",
    "such stiffness can be measured experimentally  @xcite and is found much smaller than the slider s bulk stiffness .",
    "such a low interfacial stiffness can be responsible for deviations with respect to ac friction in static contacts  @xcite .",
    "the interfacial stiffness also results in a physical finite size of the loading region , since a localized tangential force at the interface will induce tangential strains within the rough layer not only at the loaded point but also in its neighbourhood .",
    "the first effect relates to the elastic coupling of points of the interface through the slider s bulk , which can not be accounted for explicitly by a 1d model like the one considered here .",
    "in contrast , the effect of the interfacial stiffness can be introduced in a 1d model in the following way .",

    "( d ) as the block stops , the spring reattaches at @xmath108 such that the total force on the block is zero at the time of reattachment . ]    the friction force is now given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the attachment point of the spring between block @xmath13 and the track .",
    "it is given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath89 are the position of and tangential force on block @xmath13 at the instant of its last reattachment to the track .",
