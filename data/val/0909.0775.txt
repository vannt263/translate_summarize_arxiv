    "strong correlation effects in ensembles of charged particles are important in many fields of physics , including plasmas , the electron gas in solids , and electron - hole plasmas , e.g. @xcite and references therein . in recent years",
    "charged particles spatially confined in trapping potentials have attracted considerable interest .",
    "examples are ultracold ions @xcite , dusty plasmas @xcite , and electrons in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "related studies of expanding neutral plasmas have been reported as well @xcite .",
    "recently , the ground state structure of coulomb crystals formed by classical charges in a harmonic trap has been studied in detail via molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation for coulomb interaction in @xcite and for yukawa interaction in @xcite .",
    "the same system is studied here for its fluid phase at finite temperatures . for most experimental situations , e.g. in ultracold ions and dusty plasmas ,",
    "finite temperature effects are expected .",
    "the objective here is to provide a theoretical description for the structure of this system over the full range of temperatures for the fluid phase .    among the primary properties of interest is the radial density profile of the particles in the trap .",
    "a theoretical description of the ground state has been obtained via an energy minimization for both coulomb and yukawa systems without correlations @xcite , and with correlations in a local density approximation @xcite .",
    "good agreement with simulations for the spatial average density profile was obtained in this way , but a more complete representation of correlations is required for the detailed spatial modulation ( shells ) expected at all except the highest temperatures .",
    "this is confirmed by the theoretical analysis developed here , following @xcite .",
    "this theory is parameterized by the number of particles in the trap , @xmath0 , and the plasma coupling constant , @xmath1 , measuring the strength of the coulomb energy for a pair of charges in the trap relative to the kinetic energy ( defined below ) .",
    "alternatively , the average kinetic energy relative to trap energy or to coulomb energy can be used to define a dimensionless temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the range of values explored is @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) .",
    "the primary results described here are : 1 ) an extension of the hnc approximation developed for bulk fluids to systems with localized densities , within the context of density functional theory ; 2 ) a confirmation that mean field theory ( no correlations ) predicts a structureless , monotonically decreasing radial profile approaching a step function at @xmath6 ; 3 ) a demonstration that hnc correlations lead to a shell structure ( local radial peaks ) for strong coupling @xmath7 @xmath8 ; 4 ) new monte carlo simulations to test this theory ; and 5 ) a proposal for corrections to the hnc that leads to predictions in good quantitative agreement with the monte carlo simulations over the range of @xmath9 tested .",
    "the qualitative features of the shell structure arising from correlations are : the number of shells increases with @xmath0 , with new shells appearing at special values of @xmath0 ; a sharpening of the shells ( more narrow , higher amplitude ) with increasing @xmath1 ( decreasing @xmath10 ) ; and shell populations that grow monotonically with @xmath0 but which are almost independent of @xmath1 ( @xmath10 ) ( as observed in previous md simulations @xcite ) .",
    "the hnc approximation provides agreement on all qualitative features of the density profile , e.g. the location of the shells and number of particles within the shells is well - described at all coupling values .",
    "however , discrepancies with the monte carlo simulations of the order of @xmath11 for the widths and amplitudes of the shell structure are found .",
    "these discrepancies are removed by including a representation of the `` bridge functions '' neglected in the hnc approximation , referred to in the following as the adjusted hnc ( ahnc ) .",
    "the ahnc theory has the simplicity of the hnc , depending only on well - known correlations of the bulk one component plasma , and shows excellent agreement with simulations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first the hamiltonian for the system is defined and the density profile is formulated in the canonical ensemble .",
    "the relevant energy and length scales are introduced for a dimensionless representation in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( or @xmath10 ) .",
    "this is the form most appropriate for monte carlo simulation . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "the corresponding formulation is given in the grand canonical ensemble to allow exploitation of density functional theory .",
    "a formally exact representation for the density profile is obtained in appendix a in terms of correlations in a bulk one component plasma ( ocp ) , together with a corresponding exact equation for the ocp .",
    "the hnc approximation is defined in section [ sec3 ] as the neglect of the `` bridge functions '' in these two sets of equations .",
    "a further neglect of all correlations , the mean field approximation , is explored first over the whole temperature range for reference in section sec4 .",
    "the effects of correlations within the hnc approximation are illustrated in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "selected results are compared with those from monte carlo simulations in section [ sec6 ] , where the ahnc is defined and shown to give the necessary corrections to hnc required for quantitative agreement . finally the results are summarized and discussed in the last section .    in closing this introduction",
    ", it is worth emphasizing that the interesting radial structures studied occur for strong plasma coupling , @xmath12 .",
    "thus the system presents a good example of a strongly coupled coulomb system . for very large @xmath1 the shells become effectively systems of particles uniformly distributed on the surfaces of spheres of specific radii . at some point",
    "the rotational symmetry on these spherical surfaces is broken and these particles form spherical wigner crystals @xcite . an adequate description of correlations within density functional theory should provide both the fluid phase considered here and the freezing transition .",
    "the crystal phase is more subtle than in a bulk plasma since it entails packing on a non - euclidean surface , with necessary disclinations depending on the value of @xmath0 considered ( related to thomson s problem bowick ) .",
    "the determination of the non - uniform density for charges confined in a trap is similar to the complementary problem of determining the enhanced density in an ocp with an impurity ion of the opposite charge . in the latter case",
    "the density profile of the bound states corresponds to that for the charges in the trap .",
    "the formalism here extends to this case in a natural way sccs08 .",
    "both the structure and dynamics for this problem have been studied in some detail recently @xcite , and will not be considered further here .",
    "a system of @xmath0 identical charges in a spherical container of radius @xmath13 is considered .",
    "an attractive central force is applied at the origin .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath14here @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the position and velocity of charge @xmath17 .",
    "the repulsive interaction potential between charges @xmath18 and @xmath19 is denoted by @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the single particle potential @xmath22 represents the central `` confinement '' potential ( referred to as the `` trap '' below ) and @xmath23 is the wall potential ( zero inside the container and infinite otherwise ) .",
    "the focus here is on the average density of charges @xmath24 for the equilibrium state , with spherical symmetry in the fluid phase . in the classical canonical ensemble",
    "this is defined by@xmath25attention will be focused on a harmonic trap and coulomb interactions among charges .",

    "the usual choice for the length scale @xmath29 is the ion sphere radius , or mean distance between charges , given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the spatially averaged density for the confined particles .",
    "this uniform density can be characterized by the volume of a sphere inside of which the particles are localized .",
    "this localization can be due to either the walls or the trap alone , depending on conditions .",
    "confinement by the trap is determined by the condition that the net force on the outermost charge at the surface of this sphere should be zero@xmath32this applies only if @xmath33 ; otherwise the particles are confined by the wall . in the case of interest here , @xmath33 and the average density is therefore @xmath34note that the average density is independent of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , although the profile @xmath24 depends strongly on both .",

    "for the theoretical analysis of the next sections , it is more convenient to work in the grand canonical ensemble    @xmath42    with the normalization constant@xmath43here @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the chemical potential , and @xmath46 is the thermal wavelength .",
    "this choice for the ensemble allows application of methods from density functional theory @xcite .",
    "the relevant exact equations are summarized in appendix [ apa ] . in particular ,",
    "the density profile @xmath24 is related to the excess free energy @xmath47 expressed as a functional of that density@xmath48the excess free energy is a universal functional of the density such that each choice for the density corresponds to a different applied external potential .",
    "the case of interest here is the non - uniform density resulting from the harmonic trap , @xmath49 @xmath50 .",
    "a different case is a uniform density , which results from an applied potential of a uniform neutralizing charge density .",
    "this latter case is the familiar one component plasma ( ocp ) @xcite .",
    "both are described by ( [ 3.2 ] ) with the same excess free energy functional ; only the external potential is different .    in appendix [ apa ] two exact representations for @xmath51",
    "are given in terms of a uniform reference density .",
    "in the first case @xmath52 is chosen to be the coulomb interaction for an ion placed at the origin , plus the uniform neutralizing background charge . the density in ( [ 3.2 ] ) then becomes the pair distribution function @xmath53 in the ocp .",
    "the appropriate reference density is its uniform value far from the ion , for which ( [ 3.2 ] ) becomes ( see appendix [ apa ] ) @xmath54together with the ornstein - zernicke equation for the direct correlation function @xmath55 @xmath56the function @xmath57 is referred to as the ocp `` bridge function '' @xcite .    a similar rearrangement of ( [ 3.2 ] )",
    "is possible when @xmath58 is chosen to be a harmonic trap using a different representation for @xmath59 , to obtain an exact equation for the trap density @xmath24 . in this case",
    "the relevant reference density far from the trap center is zero .",
    "the analysis is outlined in appendix [ apa ] and the resulting form for eq .",
    "( [ 3.2 ] ) is @xmath60the second term is expressed in terms of the correlations for the uniform ocp , @xmath61 , evaluated at the average trap density @xmath31 of ( [ 2.6 ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath62 differs from @xmath63 , but by analogy will be referred to as the trap bridge function .",
    "equations ( [ 3.2b ] ) - ( [ 3.2a ] ) provide the formally exact description from which approximations are formulated for the trap density .",
    "further details of their context are given in the appendix .",
    "correlations among charges occur in these expressions through the bridge functions and @xmath55 .",

    "the solution to ( [ 3.3 ] ) for the mean field description of the trap density is discussed below .",
    "this mean field equation was studied for coulomb and yukawa traps in references @xcite for the special case @xmath68 .    to account for correlations",
    "the hnc approximation is used , which results from neglecting the bridge functions @xmath69 but retaining the effects of @xmath55 ( which in this approximation is denoted @xmath70 ) @xmath71@xmath72@xmath73equations ( [ 3.6 ] ) and ( [ 3.7 ] ) are a closed set of equations to determine @xmath74 and @xmath70 for the ocp , a well - studied problem @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ 3.5 ] ) is an extension of the hnc to an approximation for the localized trap density .",
    "it is shown below that the inclusion of correlations leads to qualitatively different results for the density compared to results from the mean field theory .",
    "to go beyond the hnc approximation requires some estimate of the bridge functions .",
    "this is a difficult problem in general .",
    "for the ocp , effects of @xmath75 are important only at very strong coupling . however",
    ", for the trap density the bridge functions have a quantitative importance even at moderate coupling .",
    "this is discussed in section [ sec6 ] where a phenomenological estimate is explored and shown to remove the observed discrepancies between hnc and monte carlo simulation results .",
    "further work in this direction is planned for future studies .    in the following it",
    "is convenient to write the above equations using a representation for the density in terms of a dimensionless effective potential @xmath76 , defined by @xmath77here the chemical potential @xmath45 has been eliminated in favor of the average number of particles @xmath78 .",
    "substitution of ( [ 3.8 ] ) into ( [ 3.2a ] ) gives the corresponding exact equation for @xmath76@xmath79with the notation @xmath80 .",
    "the solution is parameterized by only two dimensionless constants , @xmath81 .",
    "to develop a qualitative understanding of the dependence of the profile on the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath82 it is useful to explore this simple mean field approximation in the dimensionless variables of the last section .",
    "taking the mean field limit of ( [ 3.9 ] ) , and performing the angular integration in the second term gives the mean field equation @xmath83for high temperatures @xmath84 ( [ 3.10 ] ) gives@xmath85where an outer hard wall at @xmath86 has been restored .",
    "consequently the trap density becomes @xmath87it is understood that @xmath88 and the density is zero otherwise . for large @xmath86 ( [ 3.12 ] ) is just the expected boltzmann factor for uncorrelated particles in an external harmonic potential .",
    "however , as the number of particles in the trap increases their coulomb repulsion competes with the confining trap potential , enhancing the density toward the outer wall .",
    "for @xmath89 the density increases toward the center of the trap , while for @xmath90 it increases in the direction of the outer wall .",
    "the density is uniform at the special  value @xmath91 , the point where the coulomb repulsive force and attractive confinement force exactly balance .     for various values of @xmath1 .",
    "the coulomb limit ( @xmath92 ) is also shown . ]    at low temperatures @xmath93 and @xmath94 in ( [ 3.10 ] ) unless @xmath95 is constant , in which case these factors cancel in the numerator and denominator .",
    "therefore , a solution is sought of the form @xmath96for some constant @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "then , for @xmath99 ( [ 3.10 ] ) gives for @xmath100 @xmath101the first term must vanish for consistency with ( [ 3.13 ] ) , which determines @xmath102 @xmath103next , for @xmath99 and @xmath104 ( 3.10 ) gives@xmath105consequently , the trap density in this limit is@xmath106the density is uniform up to @xmath107 which depends only on @xmath108 , and is exponentially small for larger @xmath109 ; the density effectively has a step profile .    more generally , ( [ 3.10 ] ) can be solved numerically for the full range of @xmath1 and @xmath82 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath1 is illustrated in figure 1 for @xmath110 and @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "also shown is the limiting step function for @xmath92 .",
    "the edge of the profile is the radius at which the confinement force equals the total coulomb force , @xmath113 .",
    "although instructive as a reference , the low temperature behavior within the mean field approximation is relevant only for the average density , since charge correlation effects become dominant for @xmath114 , as shown in the next section .",
    "the density in the hnc approximation is given by ( [ 3.5 ] ) - ( [ 3.7 ] ) .",
    "the effective potential is determined from the equation @xmath115the only difference from the mean field form is the replacement of the coulomb interaction by the direct correlation function @xmath116 .",
    "this is first calculated from the corresponding hnc approximation for the ocp , ( [ 3.6 ] ) and ( [ 3.7 ] ) , and the results are illustrated in figure 2 for @xmath111 and @xmath117 .",
    "it is seen that the coulomb limit is recovered for all @xmath109 in the limit @xmath118 , and for any @xmath1 at sufficiently large @xmath109 .    .",
    "also shown is the small @xmath1 coulomb limit ( mean - field approximation ) . ]         for @xmath119 . ]    with @xmath116 known , ( [ 4.1 ] ) can be solved to determine the trap density .",
    "figure 3 shows the results for the same conditions as in figure 1 , illustrating the effects of correlations relative to the mean field results .",
    "the monotonic decrease with @xmath109 is now replaced by the appearance of structure ( `` shells '' ) for @xmath120 and @xmath112 .",
    "the latter two curves also suggest that the location of the shells is insensitive to the value of @xmath1 , as is confirmed below .",
    "figure 4 , for @xmath121 , shows that the number of `` shells '' increases with @xmath82 .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the formation and filling of the first three shells , giving the number of particles in each shell ( defined as the number between two spheres at successive radial minima ) as a function of @xmath82 for @xmath120 , @xmath112 , and @xmath122 .",
    "the initial dependence is linear as only a single outer shell is populated .",
    "however , after formation of the second shell the dependence is more complex as additional particles can go into either shell .",
    "remarkably , this process of filling is almost independent of @xmath41 ( in agreement with experiment and simulations baumgartner2007,golubnychiy2006 ) .",
    "to assess the quality of predictions based on the hnc approximation some benchmark monte carlo simulations have been performed for comparison . for moderate coupling , @xmath123 , correlations are important ( see figure 2 , for example ) but shell structure does not appear .",
    "figure 6 shows the comparison with monte carlo results for @xmath123 , and @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "not shown are results for @xmath126 where the agreement is poor even at weak coupling .",

    "it is seen that the formation and location of the peaks is very well described , but systematically their widths are too large and amplitudes too small by as much as @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , the particle number in the shells is quite accurate , as shown in figure fig5 .    .",
    "]     and @xmath119 . ]",
    "the hnc approximation provides a surprisingly good representation of correlation effects on the density profile of strongly coupled charges in a trap : formation , population , location , and number of shells .",
    "its primary limitation is the significant discrepancy in the amplitudes and widths of the shells .",
    "this is due to neglect of important contributions from the bridge functions @xmath133 and @xmath134 in ( [ 3.2b ] ) and ( [ 3.2a ] ) at strong coupling .",
    "this problem was addressed some time ago for the ocp by ng ng , who observed that the peaks of the hnc pair distribution function @xmath135 appear at the correct position but with incorrect amplitudes and widths .",
    "this is clearly analogous to the current errors of the trap density .",
    "ng corrected the hnc by an estimate of the ocp bridge function in the form@xmath136where @xmath137 is a chosen function to interpolate between @xmath138 and some constant value @xmath139 .",
    "the advantage of the chosen form is that when inserted in ( [ 3.2b ] ) the form of the hnc approximation is recovered , but with a renormalized coupling constant @xmath140 @xmath141note that @xmath142 also becomes a function of the renormalized coupling constant since it inherits that dependence only from @xmath53 via the ornstein - zernicke equation ( 3.2c ) .",
    "ng found that the monte carlo data for @xmath53 could be fit within two percent with the choice @xmath143 .",

    "most of the discrepancies are seen to be removed by this ahnc approximation .",
    "it describes accurately the complexities of the trap density over a range of @xmath151  including strong coupling , with the structural simplicity of the hnc approximation and only ocp correlations as input .",
    "its domain of applicability and limitations will be explored in more detail elsewhere .",
    "it is somewhat remarkable that the simple forms ( [ 6.1 ] ) and ( [ 6.3 ] ) for the bridge functions work so well .",
    "this success should motivate future work to address the theoretical basis for such practical approximations to the bridge functions .",
    "the objective here has been the development and exploration of a theoretical framework for analysis of the density profile of charges in a harmonic trap .",
    "previous extensive work on this problem has focused on experimental and simulation studies of the low temperature crystal structure ( and its melting ) for coulomb , yukawa , and lennard - jones interactions . here",
    "the complementary theoretical study starting from the high temperature fluid phase has been described , showing the evolution of shell structure at lower temperatures due to correlations that are precursors of the observed structure in the crystal phase . a first order representation of correlations in the hnc approximation is shown to capture the radial structural features of the density profile .",
    "particularly remarkable is the formation of `` blurred '' shells for moderate coupling at the magic numbers for tiling the sharp crystal shells .",
