    "common understanding identifies a _ network _ as a set of items , called _ nodes _ ( or vertices ) , with connections between them , called _ links _ ( or edges ) @xcite . since many systems in the real word",
    "take the form of networks ( also called _ graphs _ in much of the mathematical literature ) , they are extensively studied in many branches of science , like , for instance , social , technological , biological and physical science @xcite . at the beginning , the study of networks was one of the fundamental topics in discrete mathematics : euler is ascribed as the first providing a true proof in the theory of networks by its solution of the knigsberg problem in 1735 .",
    "recently , also thanks to the availability of computers , the study of networks moved from the analysis of single small graphs and the properties of individual nodes and links within such graphs to the consideration of large - scale statistical properties of graphs . thus , statistical methods became a prominent tool to quantify the degree of organization ( _ complexity _ ) of large networks @xcite .",
    "a typical approach in statistical mechanics of complex networks is the statistical ensemble .",
    "such an approach is a natural extension of erds - rnyi ideas @xcite .",
    "it has been performed through two basic ideas : the configuration space weight and the functional weight @xcite .",
    "the first one is proportional to the uniform probability measure on the configuration space which accounts for the way to uniformly chose graphs in the configuration space . whereas , functional weights depend on the network topologies and are chosen in order to address the statistical mechanics approach to networks different from the random graphs , which have some typical structures , like the _ small world _",
    "property @xcite , the power - law degree distribution @xcite , the correlation of node degrees @xcite , to name the most frequently addressed . during the last decade ,",
    "several works have been inspired by this approach @xcite .",
    "recently , the techniques of statistical mechanics were complemented by new topological methods : a network is encoded through a simplicial complex which can be considered as a combinatorial version of a topological space whose properties can be studied from combinatorial , topological or algebraic points of view .",
    "thus , regarding the mentioned topological aspects , different measures of simplicial complexes and of networks stemming from simplicial complexes can be defined .",
    "this provides a link between topological properties of simplicial complexes and statistical mechanics of networks from which simplicial complexes were constructed @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider a geometric entropy which is inspired by microcanonical entropy of statistical mechanics and stems from information geometry ( ig ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , a riemannian manifold ( differentiable object ) is associated to a network ( discrete object ) and the complexity measure is the logarithm of the volume of the manifold .",
    "more precisely , random variables are associated to each node of a network and their correlations are considered as weighted links among the nodes .",
    "the nature of these variables characterizes the network ( for example , each node can contain energy , or information , or represent some internal parameter of a neuron in a neural network , or the concentration of a biomolecule in a complex network of biochemical reactions , and so on ) .",
    "the variables are assumed to be random either because of the difficulty of perfectly knowing their values or because of their intrinsic random dynamical properties .",
    "thus , as it is customary for probabilistic graphs models @xcite , a joint probability mass function is associated to the description of the network . at this point",
    ", we assume gaussian joint probability mass functions because of their tractability and since they are used extensively in many applications ranging from neural networks , to wireless communication , from proteins to electronic circuits , etc .",
    "finally , the geometric complexity measure of networks is obtained by resorting to the afore mentioned relation between networks and joint probability mass functions and introducing in the space of these mass functions a riemannian structure borrowed from information geometry @xcite .",
    "in addition to the statistical methods in network complexity we also consider topological methods by encoding a network into a _ clique graph _ @xmath0 , that has the complete subgraphs as simplexes and the nodes of the graph ( network ) @xmath1 as its nodes so that it is essentially the complete subgraph complex .",
    "the maximal simplexes are given by the collection of nodes that make up the cliques of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the information about the topological space @xmath0 stored in the number and type of holes it contains .",
    "so , we exploit algebraic topology tools in order to describe a network by means of its homology groups @xcite .",
    "the ability of the geometric entropy to capture algebraic topological features of networks is investigated by a bottom - up approach .",
    "first , we consider networks with low number of nodes ( _ small  size _ ) and given homology groups .",
    "then , we compute the dimension of the homology groups of large  size networks . hence , we compare the geometric entropy against the dimensions of homology groups ( betti numbers ) revealing a clear detection of topological properties of the considered networks . in particular , when dealing with large  size networks , we consider random graphs and scale  free networks .",
    "according to the well  known transition in the appearance of a giant component@xcite , a description of networks through their betti numbers shows a clear correlation with the growth of the size of the largest components .",
    "this perfectly matches the behaviour of the geometric entropy @xcite which in turn , when compared to betti numbers of the the networks , clearly appears to probe relevant topological aspects of the networks .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we review some methods of the algebraic topology useful to describe topological properties of networks encoded in simplicial complexes . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we describe the geometric entropy stemming from both statistical methods and ig methods . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we compute the homology groups of small  size networks as well as of large size networks within the ensembles of random graphs and scale  free networks .",
    "then we compare the geometric entropy computed on these networks against their betti numbers .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "in order to make the present work self contained , we start by reviewing some methods of combinatorial algebraic topology by referring to @xcite ; these methods allow a topological characterization of networks .",
    "in particular , we focus on simplicial algebraic invariants ; among them , we select homologies since they are easier to compute than , for example , homotopy groups .",
    "let @xmath2 be a set of vertices ( or nodes ) .",
    "a _ simplex _",
    "@xmath3 in @xmath4 with dimension @xmath5 is any its subset with cardinality equal to @xmath6 , and it is called a @xmath5-simplex ; in particular the _ empty set _ is the only @xmath7-simplex .",
    "face _ of a @xmath5-simplex @xmath8 is the simplex @xmath9 whose vertices consist of any nonempty subset of the @xmath10s ; if @xmath9 is a @xmath11-simplex , with @xmath12 , it is called a @xmath11-face of @xmath3 .",
    "the subset needs not be a proper subset , so @xmath13 is regarded as a face of itself .    a _ simplicial complex _",
    "@xmath14 consists of a set @xmath4 of vertices and a set @xmath15 of simplexes such that ( i ) any set consisting of exactly one vertex is a simplex ; ( ii ) any nonempty subset of a simplex is a simplex .",
    "it follows from condition ( i ) that @xmath16-simplexes of @xmath14 correspond bijectively to vertices of @xmath14 .",
    "analogously , from condition ( ii ) it follows that any simplex is determined by its @xmath16-faces .",
    "thus , we can identify @xmath14 as the set of its simplexes , and a vertex of @xmath14 as the @xmath16-simplex corresponding to it .",
    "for example , let @xmath17 be the set of vertices , and consider the simplicial complex @xmath18 on @xmath4 with set of simplexes @xmath19 . intuitively , @xmath18 is a set of @xmath5 vertices and @xmath5 links ( edges ) among them . therefore , @xmath18 is called the _ standard polygon _ with @xmath5 edges .",

    "@xmath14 is said to be if it contains only a finite number of simplexes .",
    "in such a case @xmath26 ; however , if @xmath26 , @xmath14 needs not be finite .",
    "indeed , consider the simplicial complex @xmath14 with set of vertices @xmath27 , and as the set of simplexes the edges @xmath28 as @xmath29 varies in @xmath27 ; then @xmath30 . in this case , @xmath14 is not finite but @xmath31 .",
    "a simplicial complex @xmath14 , that we have abstractly defined upon a set of vertices @xmath32 , can be also assigned by means of a _ geometric realisation _ by assuming that its vertices are points in @xmath33 .",
    "for example , we get what is known as the natural realisation if we take @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where the @xmath36 are the standard basis vectors in @xmath37 .",
    "we note that although @xmath14 may be @xmath5-dimensional , a realisation @xmath14 may not `` fit '' into @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , the standard polygon on @xmath38 vertices can not be embedded into @xmath39 even though its dimension amounts to @xmath40 .",
    "for this reason , being networks abstract discrete objects , we rely on the combinatorial approach avoiding any particular geometric realisation .",
    "when a simplicial complex @xmath14 is finite , it is possible to introduce the _ euler - poincar characteristic _ @xmath41 as the summation along the number of all its simplexes @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of @xmath11-simplexes . in particular , we have that @xmath44 .",

    "the path @xmath63 can be contracted to the path @xmath64 , whereas there is no way to contract any paths in fig.[polygon]-right .",
    "in general , if a path @xmath65 has two consecutive steps @xmath61 , we can substitute them with the step @xmath62 ; in this way we obtain a new path @xmath66 , and we say that @xmath66 is obtained from @xmath65 by an _",
    "elementary contraction_. vice versa , we say that @xmath65 is obtained from @xmath66 by an _",
    "elementary expansion_.    two paths @xmath65 and @xmath67 in @xmath14 are called _ homotopic _ if it is possible to go from one to the other by means of a finite number of elementary expansions or contractions ; in this case we write @xmath68 .",
    "the latter is an equivalence relation that preserves the initial and the final points ; moreover the product  @xmath69 \" passes to the quotient , meaning that if @xmath70 and @xmath71 , then @xmath72 .",
    "consider now @xmath73 ; a _ loop _ with base point @xmath74 is a path in @xmath14 which starts from @xmath74 and ends at @xmath74 .",

    "there are no oriented @xmath11-simplexes ; for every vertex @xmath80 there is a unique oriented @xmath16-simplex @xmath81 .",

    "it is not difficult to show that @xmath90 for all @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath48 be an oriented @xmath11-chain in @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath91 ; then , @xmath48 is called a @xmath11-_cycle _ if @xmath92 ; @xmath48 is called a @xmath11-_boundary _ if there exists @xmath93 such that @xmath94 .",

    "[ polygon ] , we can see that the oriented chain @xmath99 is a boundary , while the chain @xmath100 is not .",
    "since @xmath97 for all @xmath98 , we can consider the quotient module @xmath101 ( called @xmath11th - module of homology ) .",
    "intuitively , the construction of homology assumes that we are removing the cycles that are boundaries of higher dimension from the set of all @xmath11-cycles , so that the ones that remain carry information about @xmath11-dimensional holes of the simplicial complex .",
    "if @xmath102 is finitely generated ( which is necessarily true if @xmath14 has finitely many simplexes ) from the structure theorem @xcite it follows the @xmath102 is isomorphic to the direct sum of a finite free @xmath27-module @xmath103 and a finite number of finite cyclic groups @xmath104 , where @xmath105 divides @xmath106 .",

    "the same methods can be applied to any connected components of @xmath14 whenever it is not connected .",
    "therefore , the betti number @xmath57 counts the number of loops ( one dimensional holes ) that are present in a simplicial complex @xmath14 .",
    "finally , as far as the module @xmath150 is concerned , consider a @xmath40-connected simplicial complex @xmath14 , i.e. it is connected and simply connected .",
