    "the example is associated with the the onset of cavitation  from a homogeneously deformed state  for the equations of nonlinear elasticity in homogeneous and isotropic elastic media .",
    "any attempt to study solutions that lie at the limits of continuum modeling ( like cavities or shear bands ) needs to reckon with the problem of giving a proper definition for such solutions .",
    "proposing such a definition is the main premise of the present work .",
    "we consider the initial - boundary value problem for the equations of elasticity @xmath0 for a given stretching @xmath1 and some @xmath2 here , @xmath3 stands for the motion , @xmath4 is the deformation gradient , and we employ the constitutive theory of hyperelasticity , that the piola  kirchhoff stress @xmath5 is given as the gradient of a stored energy density @xmath6 the homogeneous deformation @xmath7 solves - .",
    "the stored energy function determines the constitutive properties of the elastic material and - due to frame indifference - has to be invariant under rotations . for homogeneous and _ isotropic _",
    "elastic materials @xmath8 takes the simplified form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a symmetric function of the eigenvalues @xmath11 of @xmath12 ; see @xcite . in that case",
    "admits as solutions radially symmetric motions , @xmath13 generated by solving for the amplitude @xmath14 the initial - boundary value problem for the equations of isotropic radial elastodynamics , @xmath15 this problem admits the special solution @xmath16 corresponding to a state of homogeneous deformation .",
    "the question arises if additional solutions of - may be constructed by solving the problem - .",
    "this idea was pursued by ball @xcite using methods from the calculus of variations to construct cavitating solutions in the context of static elasticity .",
    "the study @xcite was groundbreaking in part because continuum modeling is used to address a problem that at least _ pro - forma _ concerns situations beyond its range of applicability .",
    "there exists a critical stretching @xmath17 so that for @xmath18 the only equilibrium solution is the homogeneously deformed state ; by contrast , for @xmath19 there exist non - trivial equilibria corresponding to a cavity in the material and with energy _ less _ than the energy of the homogeneous deformation @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite ( and references therein ) for an account of developments concerning cavitating equilibrium solutions in nonlinear elasticity .    in another remarkable development , k.a .",
    "pericak - spector and s. spector @xcite use the ansatz @xmath20 to construct a self - similar weak solution for the dynamic problem - that corresponds to a spherical cavity emerging at time @xmath21 from a homogeneously deformed state .",
    "the solution in @xcite is constructed in dimension @xmath22 for polyconvex stored energies of the special form @xmath23 where @xmath24 satisfies the hypotheses @xmath25 the hypothesis @xmath26 refers to polyconvexity , while @xmath27 indicates elasticity of softening type ; more general stored energies were treated in @xcite .",
    "it is proved in @xcite that the self - similar solution has smaller mechanical energy than the associated homogeneously deformed state from where it emerges , and thus provides an example of nonuniqueness of entropy weak solutions ( at least for polyconvex energies ) . as already noted in @xcite ,",
    "the paradox arises that by opening a cavity the energy of the material decreases , what induces an autocatalytic mechanism for failure .",
    "there is a class of problems in material science , such as fracture , cavitation or shear bands , where discontinuous motions emerge from smooth motions via a mechanism of material instabilities .",
    "of course after the material breaks or a shear band forms the motion can no longer be described at the level of continuum modeling and microscopic modeling or higher - order regularizing mechanisms have to be taken into account .",
    "still , as such structures develop there is expected an intermediate time scale where both types of modeling apply .",
    "the premise of this work is to introduce a meaning for solutions at this intermediate scale and to explore its ramifications .",
    "the idea is roughly the following , presented here at the level of . given a possibly discontinuous motion @xmath28 we introduce the averaged motions @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a mollifier , and define @xmath31 to be a singular limiting induced from continuum solution ( in short a _",
    "slic_-solution ) if for every choice of the mollifier the smooth approximating family in the limit of small - scale averaging gives @xmath32 in this notion the precise form of regularizing mechanisms is not taken into account , instead it is enforced that they act in a stable way amounting to averaging of the tested solution .",
    "moreover , the energy equation for , @xmath33 suggests that , even though @xmath34 in @xmath35 , the power of the `` microscopic forces '' @xmath36 may well have a non - trivial contribution in the limit , which needs to be calculated .",
    "the definition of slic - solutions exploits the fact that the momentum equation is a second - order evolution .",
    "it has certain conceptual analogies to the approach of weak asymptotic solution employed by danilov and shelkovich @xcite in order to define solutions for special systems of conservation laws involving delta shocks as asymptotic limits of smooth approximate solutions .",
    "there are also certain differences with the concept of weak asymptotic solution : slic - solutions are generated via averagings of a candidate discontinuous solution , and are natural in a context of discontinuous solutions for second order evolution equations .",
    "the latter property provides a mechanical intuition for the definition and suggests its name .",
    "we examine the ramifications of this definition in three examples . in section [ sec - fracture ]",
    "we consider the equations of one - dimensional elasticity @xmath37 and test a specific example of a motion , @xmath38 towards being a slic - solution .",
    "the example is a counterpart ( in the one - dimensional case ) of the cavitating solutions ( for @xmath39 ) of @xcite and corresponds to a crack forming out of a homogeneously deformed state at the location @xmath40 at time @xmath21 , in conjunction with two outgoing lax - shocks propagating at @xmath41 .",
    "it is more singular than the dynamic cavitating solution in @xcite as @xmath42 has a delta - mass at the origin .",
    "a definition of the notion of slic - solution is given in definition [ defslicconvx ] , conditions are then provided under which is a slic - solution for in proposition [ propo - slic1d ] , and the energy balance for the approximate solution of the crack is computed in proposition [ propo - eb1d ] .",
    "it turns out that can be interpreted as a slic - solution , at the same time there is an energetic cost for creating the crack that is projected in the limiting energy balance equation .    in section [ sec : cavitation ]",
    ", we consider the dynamically cavitating solution , with @xmath43 as constructed in @xcite ( see lemma [ lem : psest ] stating its properties ) . the notion of slic - solution adapted to that example",
    "is provided in definition [ def : slic3d ] and a natural definition for the energy is given in definition [ def : energy3d ] .",
    "the analysis is more cumbersome and is based on detailed estimations of the layers of the approximate solution , but the results parallel those of the one - dimensional example .",
    "namely , conditions are given under which the cavitating solutions provide a slic - solution in theorem [ lem : slic3d ] , and the energy balance of the approximate solutions is computed in proposition [ lem : energy3d2 ] . regarding the issue of uniqueness of entropy weak solutions , it turns out that if the solution is construed as an entropy weak solution , then there is non - uniqueness .",
    "by contrast , if the solution is construed in the slic - sense , then there is a contribution to the total energy in the process of forming the cavity which results to the energy after the cavity formation being larger than before the cavitation ( proposition [ lem : increase ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the notion of entropy weak solutions is inadequate when dealing with discontinuous solutions and in particular it can not account for the work needed to create the cavity .",
    "a more discriminating concept of solution has to be employed on strong singularities , and the slic - solution concept is such a possibility .",
    "the last example is the riemann problem for the p - system in lagrangean coordinates with vacuum initial data .",
    "it has been conjectured that delta - shocks are needed to resolve the riemann problem with vacuum ( * ? ? ? * sec 9.6 ) , a proper definition for such solutions is not available at the hyperbolic level , nevertheless solutions with delta shocks are constructed by using viscous wave fans in the zero - viscosity limit ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * sec 9.8 ) ) . in section [ sec - vacuum ] , we provide a definition for self - similar slic - solutions ( definition [ def : selfsimslic ] ) which is capable to define riemann solutions with delta - shocks at the hyperbolic level without recourse to a construction method ( theorem [ lem : vac : sol ] ) and to calculate their mechanical energy ( proposition [ lem : vac : energy ] ) .",

    "the hypothesis @xmath55 is appropriate for an elastic material exhibiting softening elastic response and plays an important role in the forthcoming analysis .",
    "the hypothesis is applicable in the case of longitudinal motions and is placed to exclude that a finite volume is compressed down to zero . in the sequel we will consider only tensile deformations and this hypothesis will not play any significant role .",

    "we are interested in self - similar solutions @xmath63 , with @xmath64 a function of the similarity variable @xmath65 .",
    "the function @xmath66 solves the equation @xmath67 alternatively , we may introduce in the self - similar ansatz @xmath68 , @xmath69 and recast it in the form of the riemann problem @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "if @xmath73 is sufficiently large we expect that the elastic bar will break . once the bar breaks , coherence is lost and the hypothesis of continuum implicit in the derivation of",
    "is no longer valid .",
    "nevertheless , there will be a transition region from a range of loading where the model is valid to a range where it loses validity , and in some situations one may arguably give some meaning to equation past the transition regime .",
    "it is precisely this transition at the onset of fracture that we wish to explore .",
    "the scope of this section is to test a class of self - similar solutions describing the onset of fracture in one - space dimension that are generated by the function @xmath66 : @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath73 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are positive parameters that satisfy @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and are connected through the equations @xmath80 the function @xmath66 is continuous at @xmath81 but discontinuous at the origin @xmath82 .",
    "the associated distributions @xmath83 and @xmath84 are determined via : @xmath85    in the sequel we propose a notion of solution according to which the function may be interpreted as a solution of .",
    "several preliminary remarks are in order :    * the solution has several common features and was in fact inspired by the dynamic cavitating solutions in three - dimensions proposed in the important work by spector and pericak - spector @xcite .",
    "one important difference is that the cavitating solutions in @xcite do not involve a delta measure for the strain . in the present one - dimensional situation",
    "the solution may be thought as describing fracture , and accordingly we will call it a crack .",
    "* for @xmath73 fixed , there is a one parameter family of functions that satisfy , . *",
    "note that @xmath86 and that @xmath87 .",
    "accordingly , at time @xmath21 the bar is in a configuration of homogeneous deformation with strain @xmath73 and at rest . * for positive times the function @xmath63 has a jump at the origin associated to a crack that is moving according to @xmath88 .",
    "the parameter @xmath77 stands for the speed of the crack . *",
    "the singularities at @xmath81 are shocks .",
    "the rankine - hugoniot conditions at @xmath89 , @xmath90 are satisfied due to , .",
    "this shock belongs to the second characteristic family . in view of hypothesis",
    ", the lax shock - admissibility criterion @xmath91 will be satisfied provided that @xmath92 .",
    "a similar analysis indicates that the shock at @xmath93 belongs to the first characteristic family and satisfies the rankine - hugoniot conditions and the lax shock - admissibility criterion . *",
    "the distribution @xmath94 contains the delta measure @xmath95 and therefore on one hand it is more singular than the usual solution of the riemann problem , on the other hand one needs to give a meaning to @xmath51 .",
    "a direct computation , using and the identity @xmath96 in @xmath35 , shows that @xmath97 in the sense of distributions .",
    "hence , @xmath98 is satisfied .",
    "it remains to give a meaning to @xmath99 .",
    "indeed , this is a main task of this section , and will be done through the notion of _ singular limiting induced from continuum solution _ that we introduce in the sequel .    in what follows we test @xmath63 , with @xmath64 defined in , towards being a solution ( interpreted in an appropriate sense ) of .",
    "it is expedient to extend the function @xmath100 for @xmath101 by setting @xmath102 .",

    "note that @xmath100 has a discontinuity at @xmath40 , but it is continuous at the shocks @xmath41 due to .",
    "for longitudinal deformations of an elastic bar , the motion may be interpreted as a crack emerging at time @xmath21 from a homogeneously deformed state ; the form of the solution in the @xmath104 plane is shown in figure [ fig1](a ) .",

    "there is a class of problems in material science where structures with discontinuous displacement fields emerge via a material instability mechanism .",
    "typical examples are development of cracks in fracture , cavitation in elastic response , or formation of shear bands in plastic deformations .",
    "such problems lie at the limits of applicability of continuum modeling and the usual concept of weak solutions is in any case inadequate to describe these motions .",
    "nevertheless , as the material transitions from a regime where continuum modeling is applicable to a regime that the model has to be modified ( or perhaps atomistic modeling has to be employed ) , it is expected that at the interface both types of modeling have to apply in an intermediate regime .",
    "it is further expected that such structures should appear in a small parameter limit of more complex models that incorporate `` higher - order physics '' , and that their appearance occurs in a stable way .",
    "the concept of _ singular limiting induced from continuum solution _ ( in short _ slic_-solution ) is an attempt to give meaning to such discontinuous solutions .",
    "it is presented here at the level of the equations of nonlinear elasticity . roughly speaking a discontinuous solution of",
    "will be a slic - solution if it can be obtained as the limit of approximate smooth solutions that are an averaging of @xmath100 .",
    "more precisely :    [ defslic ] let @xmath114 where @xmath115 is an open domain in space - time .",
    "given a mollifier @xmath116 , with @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , we set @xmath120 . for any @xmath121 , @xmath122 compactly embedded in @xmath115 , the averaged function @xmath123 is well defined for @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "we will say that @xmath31 is a _ singular limiting induced from continuum solution _ of if , for any mollifier @xmath126 any @xmath121 and for @xmath127 , @xmath128    several remarks are in order .",
    "this definition incorporates as a requirement that the singular solution results by a smooth averaging process , but it does not contain any additional information on the approximation process that might induce a mechanism for selecting among singular solutions . one can easily check that the usual concept of weak solutions ( containing shocks ) of the equations of elasticity are also slic - solutions . finally , the concept of slic - solution is quite natural when continuum modeling is viewed as resulting from the discrete , especially in situations where the distance between lattice elements is large but nevertheless matter is present . in that sense",
    "it is more natural in a context of shear bands than in a context of cavitation after a hole has fully formed .    the definition of _",
    "slic_-solution is cumbersome to use in practice .",
    "nevertheless , it provides a theoretical framework to define such singular solutions and to calculate the ramifications on the energy .",
    "a difficulty occurs because in the general setting of definition [ defslic ] averaging in both space and time is required . for hyperbolic problems we expect that averaging in space will also induce averaging in time and in many settings",
    "the double averaging might be avoided .",
    "also , in practice we expect to check the definition at only local singularities what simplifies calculations .",
    "in particular when checking it for self - similar solutions averaging in space only is adequate .    for certain special systems of conservation laws , like the system of pressureless gas dynamics and the so called keyfitz - kranzer system , there has been suggested to use solutions that take values in measures , a literature going by the name of delta - shocks ( _ e.g. _ @xcite @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec 9.6 ) and references therein ) .",
    "danilov and shelkovich @xcite have proposed to define delta shocks as asymptotic limits of smooth approximate solutions , a process that they call weak asymptotic solution .",
    "this definition has obvious similarities to the concept of slic - solution presented here .",
    "there are also two differences : first , the notion of slic - solution is connected via averaging to a possibly discontinuous `` solution candidate '' , second , slic - solutions emerge in a context of discontinuous solutions for second order evolution equations , what provides a mechanical intuition for the definition and suggests the name .",
    "next , we turn to the example of the fracturing solution with the objective to test it as a slic - solution for the equations . as already mentioned",
    "the goal is to give a meaning to the solution at @xmath40 . to simplify calculations",
    "we will introduce a variant of definition [ defslic ] that uses a mollification in the space variable @xmath129 only :    [ defslicconvx ] let @xmath130 satisfy for some @xmath131 the monotonicity condition : @xmath132 for @xmath30 a mollifier , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 ( the ball of radius 1 ) , @xmath136 , we let @xmath137 and define the averaged function @xmath138 the function @xmath100 is called a singular limiting induced from continuum ( slic ) solution of provided for any symmetric mollifier @xmath139 as @xmath140 for @xmath141    to justify that the left hand side of is well defined , observe that in view of @xmath142 and thus for @xmath100 of class @xmath143 , the derivative @xmath144 .",
