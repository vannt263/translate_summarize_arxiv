    "recently , significant amount of digital data on the behavior of individuals has enabled us to quantitatively explore the various patterns of human dynamics .",
    "one of the robust findings is that human dynamics is not random but correlated , such that the bursts of rapidly occuring events alternate with long inactive periods  @xcite .",
    "the bursty dynamics is typically characterized by the heavy tailed or power - law distributions of waiting time or inter - event time @xmath0 as @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 for e - mail and mobile phone call ( mpc ) communications  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the origin of bursts in human dynamics has been debated for the past few years .",
    "the bursts can emerge from the individual selection of tasks from the task list according to the protocol `` the highest priority task first ''  @xcite .",
    "the long waiting time of a task with low priority leads to the heavy tail of the waiting time distribution .",
    "this model assumes that there are at least two tasks to be compared , which is not necessarily the case in reality . on the other hand the circadian and weekly activity patterns of humans can also result in the long periods of inactivity that contribute to the heavy tails  @xcite . in this approach the circadian and weekly patterns",
    "have been modeled by the non - homogeneous poisson process , implying that human behavior is essentially random .",
    "while both models are based on intuitive and to some extent realistic assumptions , they are not able to consider other human related factors properly , such as how individual agents reply to the received e - mail or phone call , and what is the benefit or cost of communication .    in order to investigate the role of human factors in bursty human dynamics we devise a model , where an individual agent reacts upon the lack of information , such that an information seeking agent sends an e - mail or makes a phone call to an information provider . with this model",
    "we describe the time frame of how long people wait for responses from the information providers under uncertain ( risky ) situations and get insight into which human factors in the daily communication are relevant to the bursty dynamics . here",
    "we start with an assumption that an agent prefers a fixed amount of payoff over a risky lottery of the same expected payoff , which is called _ risk - aversion_. a risk - averse agent can reduce uncertainty by communicating for information , which is a time - consuming process .",
    "once an agent requests information , we consider the time to wait for responses , i.e. the waiting time , as a cost .",
    "this reflects a well - known economic perspective that time and information are considered as tradable goods  @xcite .",
    "based on the trade - off between the information gain and the cost of the waiting time , the agent chooses an optimal waiting time .",
    "note that we confine our model to risk - averse agents because the optimal waiting time for risk - pursuing agents is always zero and the waiting time does not matter for risk - neutral agents unless the information gain is unequal to the cost of time . by optimizing the waiting time",
    ", we derive a specific ( positive ) relationship between the risk and the optimal waiting time .",
    "then , we show that the optimal waiting time distribution follows a power - law , which serves as theoretical support for the observed bursty dynamics in e - mail and mobile phone call communications .",
    "our model gives insight into the human communication dynamics , i.e. how people are concerned with the communication efficiency and the cost per unit time while deciding the communication channel as well as the time to wait for responses .",
    "since the efficiency and the cost per unit time are heterogenous in different communication channels , the optimal channel depends on how urgent the situations are and how patient the users are .",
    "furthermore , the efficiency and the cost per unit time also change the optimal choice of the waiting time .",
    "we find that if the cost per unit time dominates over the efficiency , people are concerned with both the efficiency and the cost per unit time under the low risk situation , while they consider only the efficiency under the high risk situation .",
    "this explains the effect of human factors on communication such that in riskier situation people tend to focus more on reducing the risk without concerning the cost , because shortening the waiting time by the efficient communication is preferred to concern the cost itself .",
    "however , if the cost per unit time is dominated by the efficiency , the result is opposite .",
    "people are concerned with only the efficiency under the low risk situation and consider both the efficiency and the cost per unit time under the high risk situation , which implies that people do not consider the cost per unit time seriously under the low risk ( short waiting time ) but do under the high risk ( long waiting time ) . in conclusion",
    "the individual agents attitude towards risk can be one of the explanations for the pattern of the waiting time in communication .",
    "in section  [ sect : model ] we describe and analyze the model and explain the implications of the results .",
    "then we make conclusions in section  [ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "as in  @xcite we consider the risk - averse utility function , @xmath4 of state @xmath5 , whose degree of risk - aversion is measured by @xmath6 . for simplicity , we set @xmath7 and then consider a risk - averse agent with utility function given by @xmath8 corresponding to a time - dependent state @xmath9 . at the beginning @xmath10",
    ", the state @xmath11 is uniformly distributed from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "then , after waiting time @xmath14 for information about the state @xmath5 , the agent reduces the uncertainty on the state as @xmath15 .",
    "that is , the state becomes more specified .",
    "the decreasing speed of uncertainty is controlled by the parameter @xmath16 , which we call _",
    "efficiency_.    as an example let us consider a job applicant who got offers from 5 firms , indexed by @xmath17 and let @xmath18 be the set of wages of firms , which is the initial `` state '' if the applicant is uninformed .",
    "he chooses one of them and his utility depends on the wage of the firm chosen such that @xmath19 .",
    "then suppose that the applicant can obtain information on the unknown wages .",
    "if the information he will get at time @xmath20 is the exact amount of @xmath21 , the state becomes @xmath22 . at time @xmath20 , the applicant can make a clearer decision than he could at time @xmath10 because the number of unknown wages at @xmath20 is 4 . as the applicant knows the wages one - by - one ,",
    "his decision gets improved , and eventually at time @xmath23 , he will know the firm of the highest wage so that the best decision without uncertainty can be made .",
    "the time the agent waits for information to reduce the uncertainty can be considered as a cost .",
    "let @xmath24 be the cost of time @xmath25 . for simplicity , we assume that the cost per unit time is constant but dependent on the uncertainty level @xmath26 such that @xmath27 with positive @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this assumption describes that given the level of the uncertainty @xmath26 , the cost of time is constantly increasing in time @xmath25 at the rate of uncertainty except for the case with @xmath30 .",
    "the larger value of @xmath29 corresponds to the larger cost of the time unit , indicating that the parameter @xmath29 controls _ the cost per unit time_.    now we define the agent s expected utility at state @xmath9 subtracted by the cost of time as follows : @xmath31-c(t)\\nonumber\\\\      & = & a -\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx \\sqrt{\\frac{t^\\gamma}{2\\pi\\sigma^2 } } \\exp \\left(-x -\\frac{x^2t^\\gamma}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)-c(t)\\nonumber\\\\      & = & a - \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2t^\\gamma}\\right ) -c(t).\\label{eq : expectutil}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the agent chooses the optimal waiting time for information . at @xmath32 maximizing eq .",
    "( [ eq : expectutil ] ) , the following condition is satisfied : @xmath33 from this equation and by means of lambert function @xmath34 , satisfying @xmath35 , we obtain the optimal waiting time @xmath0 as a function of @xmath36 , as follows @xmath37}\\right)^{-1/\\gamma},\\label{eq : tau_exact}\\ ] ] where @xmath38^{1/\\gamma}$ ] and @xmath39 .",
    "we first consider the special case with @xmath40 , i.e. of balancing the efficiency and the cost per unit time , leading to @xmath41 with @xmath42 . by using the identity of @xmath43 and by assuming the distribution of @xmath36 to be @xmath44 , we get the optimal waiting time distribution @xmath45 as @xmath46 with the power - law exponent @xmath47 and the cutoff waiting time @xmath48 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath49 , which requires the strong cutoff such as the ( stretched ) exponential one as we have assumed .    due to the technical differences among communication channels , the optimal waiting time @xmath0 can be channel - oriented .",
    "for example , one might wait longer for e - mail responses than for face - to - face responses , and e - mail responses might be faster than post responses .",
    "thus , it is plausible that when people choose communication channels , they might expect different waiting time to different channels and choose a suitable channel to the level of uncertainty .",
    "this channel preference can be considered in two ways : the efficiency and the cost per unit time .",
    "firstly , the parameter @xmath50 can be interpreted as the channel - oriented sensitivity on uncertainty .",
    "based on the empirical observation of @xmath2 and @xmath3 for e - mail and mpc communications , respectively , one can argue that the corresponding values of @xmath50 would be @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this implies that e - mail communication rarely reduces uncertainty as e - mail users wait time for information . on the other hand",
    ", mobile phone users can reduce uncertainty more efficiently . in terms of the cost per unit time ,",
    "the e - mail and the mpc can be compared as follows : @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "since the cost per unit time for e - mails is lower than that for mpcs , the empirical observations can be interpreted such that people are more patient to wait for the e - mail responses than for the mpc responses .",
    "hence e - mail ( mpc ) is less ( more ) efficient and less ( more ) costly communication channel so that e - mail is more suitable than mpc for non - urgent situations and consequently people would prefer mpc when they need information urgently .    since the eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau_exact ] ) can not be expressed in terms of elementary functions , we use the asymptotic expansions of the lambert function : @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "let us now consider the case with @xmath59 , where the cost per unit time is dominant over the efficiency . when @xmath60 , we obtain the scaling relation @xmath61 on the other hand , for the range of @xmath62 , the scaling relation with logarithmic correction is obtained as @xmath63^{-1/\\gamma},\\ \\delta_2=\\frac{2}{\\gamma},\\label{eq : log}\\ ] ] where @xmath64}$ ] .",
    "therefore , we find two scaling regimes as @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath69 denotes the crossover uncertainty and also defines the crossover waiting time @xmath70 .",
    "it indicates that the optimal waiting time distribution shows two scaling regimes with power - law exponents @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath75 for any positive @xmath29 and @xmath50 .    intuitively , the optimal behavior of individual agents is changing according to the risk . under the low risk situation ( @xmath66 ) ,",
    "the power - law exponent @xmath76 as a function of @xmath29 and @xmath50 explains the case where people are concerned with the efficiency as well as the cost per unit time when the risk is not significantly high .",
    "on the other hand , under the high risk situation ( @xmath68 ) , the power - law exponent @xmath77 turns out to be independent of @xmath29 . unlike for the low risk situations ,",
    "people under the high risk consider only the efficiency , i.e. it is better to obtain information as quickly as possible due to the high cost of time .",
