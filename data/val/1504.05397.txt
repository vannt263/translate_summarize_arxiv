    "the flux of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) above @xmath7 ev is known to be suppressed with respect to that extrapolated from lower energies .",
    "this feature has been seen in the uhecr spectrum @xcite , with the position of the break being compatible with the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect @xcite , i.e. the interaction of uhecrs with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",
    "however , other explanations are possible , most prominently a scenario where the limiting energy of the uhecr sources is being observed @xcite .",
    "key to distinguishing between these two scenarios is the determination of the composition of the uhecrs @xcite , with the second scenario predicting increasing fractions of primaries heavier than protons as energy increases @xcite .    above @xmath7 ev",
    "cosmic - ray protons interact with cmb photons and produce ultra - high energy _ cosmogenic _",
    "neutrinos of energies typically @xmath8 of the proton energy @xcite .",
    "their fluxes are uncertain and at eev energies they depend mostly on the evolution with redshift @xmath9 of the unknown sources of uhecrs , and on their spectral features at injection .",
    "protons typically produce more neutrinos than heavier primaries do @xcite , so measurement of the neutrino flux gives information on the nature of the primaries . in this respect",
    "the observation of uhe neutrinos can provide further hints on the dominant scenario of uhecr production @xcite , as well as on the evolution with @xmath9 of their sources which can help in their identification @xcite .",
    "uhe neutrinos are also expected to be produced in the decay of charged pions created in the interactions of cosmic rays with matter and/or radiation at their potential sources , such as gamma - ray bursts or active galactic nuclei among others @xcite .",
    "in fact , at tens of eev , neutrinos may be the only direct probe of the sources of uhecrs at distances farther than @xmath10 mpc .",
    "a breakthrough in the field was the recent detection with the icecube experiment of three neutrinos of energies just above 1 pev , including a 2 pev event which is the highest - energy neutrino interaction ever observed , followed by tens of others above @xmath11 tev representing a @xmath12 excess above atmospheric neutrino background @xcite .",
    "the measured flux is close to the waxman - bahcall upper bound to the uhe neutrino flux @xcite , although with a steeper spectrum @xcite .    in the eev energy range , i.e. about three orders of magnitude above the most energetic neutrinos detected in icecube",
    ", neutrinos have so far escaped detection by existing experiments .",
    "these can be detected with a variety of techniques @xcite , among them with arrays of particle detectors at ground .    in this work",
    "we report on the search for eev neutrinos in data taken with the surface detector array ( sd ) of the pierre auger observatory @xcite . a blind scan of data from 1 january 2004 up to 20",
    "june 2013 has yielded no neutrino candidates and an updated and stringent limit to the diffuse flux of uhe neutrino flux has been obtained .",
    "the concept for identification of neutrinos is rather simple .",
    "while protons , heavier nuclei , and even photons interact shortly after entering the atmosphere , neutrinos can initiate showers quite deep in the atmosphere . at large",
    "zenith angles the atmosphere is thick enough so that the electromagnetic component of nucleonic cosmic rays gets absorbed and the shower front at ground level is dominated by muons ( `` old '' shower front ) .",
    "on the other hand , showers induced by neutrinos deep in the atmosphere have a considerable amount of electromagnetic component at the ground ( `` young '' shower front ) . the surface detector array ( sd ) of the pierre auger observatory",
    "is not directly sensitive to the muonic and electromagnetic components of the shower separately , nor to the depth at which the shower is initiated . in the @xmath13 water - cherenkov stations of the sd of the pierre auger observatory ,",
    "spread over an area of @xmath14 , separated by @xmath15 and arranged in a triangular grid , the signals produced by the passage of shower particles are digitised with flash analog to digital converters ( fadc ) with 25 ns resolution .",
    "this allows us to distinguish narrow signals in time induced by inclined showers initiated high in the atmosphere , from the broad signals expected in inclined showers initiated close to the ground .    applying this simple idea , with the sd of the pierre auger observatory",
    "@xcite we can efficiently detect inclined showers and search for two types of neutrino - induced showers at energies above about 1 eev :    1 .",
    "earth - skimming ( es ) showers induced by tau neutrinos ( @xmath16 ) that travel in a slightly upward direction with respect to ground . can skim the earth s crust and interact relatively close to the surface inducing a tau lepton which escapes the earth and decays in flight in the atmosphere , close to the sd .",
    "+ typically , only earth - skimming -induced showers with zenith angles @xmath17 may be identified .",
    "2 .   showers initiated by any neutrino flavor moving down at large angles with respect to the vertical that interact in the atmosphere close to the surface detector array through charged - current ( cc ) or neutral - current ( nc ) interactions .",
    "we include here showers induced by interacting in the mountains surrounding the .",
    "although this latter process is exactly equivalent to the `` earth - skimming '' mechanism , it is included in this class because such showers are also going downwards . in the following",
    "we will refer to all these types of showers as  downward - going \" ( dg ) @xmath18-induced showers .",
    "+ with the aid of monte carlo simulations we have established that this search can be performed efficiently as long as it is restricted to showers with zenith angles @xmath19 . due to the characteristics of these showers depending on the zenith angle ,",
    "the search in this channel was performed in two angular subranges : ( a )  low \" zenith angle ( dgl ) corresponding to @xmath20 and ( b )  high \" zenith angle ( dgh ) with @xmath21 .",
    "the identification of potential neutrino - induced showers is based on first selecting those events that arrive in rather inclined directions , and then selecting among them those with fadc traces that are spread in time , indicative of the early stage of development of the shower and a clear signature of a deeply interacting neutrino triggering the sd .    first of all , events occurring during periods of data acquisition instabilities @xcite are excluded . for the remaining events",
    "the fadc traces of the triggered stations are first `` cleaned '' to remove accidental signals @xcite induced mainly by random atmospheric muons arriving closely before or after the shower front .",
    "these muons are typically produced in lower energy showers ( below the energy threshold of the sd of the auger observatory ) that arrive by chance in coincidence with the triggering shower . a procedure to select the stations participating in the event described in @xcite is then applied , with the event accepted if the number of accepted stations @xmath22 is at least three ( four ) in the earth - skimming ( downward - going ) selections .    from the pattern ( footprint ) of stations at ground a length @xmath23 along the arrival direction of the event and a width @xmath24 perpendicular to it characterizing the shape of the footprint",
    "are extracted @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath25 in vertical events , increasing gradually as the zenith angle increases .",
    "very inclined events typically have elongated patterns on the ground along the direction of arrival and hence large values of @xmath26 .",
    "a cut in @xmath26 is therefore a good discriminator of inclined events .",
    "another indication of inclined events is given by the apparent speed @xmath27 of the trigger from a station @xmath28 to a station @xmath29 , averaged over all pairs @xmath30 of stations in the event .",
    "this observable denoted as is obtained from the distance between the stations after projection along @xmath23 and from the difference in trigger times of the stations . in vertical showers",
    "exceeds the speed of light since all triggers occur at roughly the same time , while in very inclined events is concentrated around the speed of light .",
    "moreover its root - mean - square ( rms(@xmath27 ) ) value is small . for downward - going events only , a cut on the reconstructed zenith angle @xmath31",
    "is applied @xcite .",
    "once inclined showers are selected the next step is to identify young showers . a time - over - threshold ( tot )",
    "triggers above a threshold of @xmath32 ( the peak value of the signal expected for a vertical muon crossing the station ) , in coincidence in 2 out of 3 pmts @xcite . ]",
    "is usually present in sd stations with signals extended in time , while narrow signals induce other local triggers .",
    "also the area - over - peak ratio ( aop ) , defined as the ratio of the integral of the fadc trace to its peak value , normalized to the average signal produced by a single muon , provides an estimate of the spread - in - time of the traces , and serves as an observable to discriminate broad from narrow shower fronts .",
    "in particular , a cut on aop allows the rejection of background signals induced by inclined hadronic showers , in which the muons and their electromagnetic products are concentrated within a short time interval , exhibiting aop values close to the one measured in signals induced by isolated muons .",
    "these observables are used by themselves in the search for @xmath18 candidates , or combined in a linear fisher - discriminant polynomial depending on the selection as described later in this work .    as a general procedure and to optimize the numerical values of the cuts and tune the algorithms needed to separate neutrino - induced showers from the much larger background of hadronic showers , we divided the whole data sample ( 1 january 2004 - 20 june 2013 ) into two parts ( excluding periods of array instability ) .",
    "a selection dependent fraction of the data @xmath33 , along with monte carlo simulations of uhe neutrinos , is dedicated to define the selection algorithm , the most efficient observables and the value of the cuts on them .",
    "these data are assumed to be overwhelmingly constituted of background showers .",
    "the applied procedure is conservative because the presence of neutrinos in the training data would result in a more severe definition of the selection criteria .",
    "the remaining fraction of data is not used until the selection procedure is established , and then it is  unblinded \" to search for neutrino candidates .",
    "we used real data to train the selections instead of monte carlo simulations of hadronic showers , the primary reason being that the detector simulation may not account for all possible detector fluctuations that may induce events that constitute a background to uhe neutrinos , while they are contained in data .",
    "it is important to remark that this is the same selection procedure and training period as in previous publications @xcite , which is applied in this work to a larger data set .",
    "regarding the monte carlo simulations , the phase space of the neutrino showers reduces to three variables : the neutrino energy @xmath34 , the incidence zenith angle @xmath35 and the interaction depth @xmath36 in the atmosphere for downward - going neutrinos , or the altitude @xmath37 of the @xmath38 decay above ground in the case of earth - skimming neutrinos .",
    "showers were simulated with energies from @xmath39 to @xmath40 in steps of @xmath41 , zenith angles from @xmath42 to @xmath43 in steps of 0.01 rad ( es ) and from @xmath44 to @xmath45 in steps of 0.05 rad ( dg ) .",
    "the values of @xmath37 range from 0 to 2500 m ( in steps of 100 m ) whereas @xmath36 is uniformly distributed along the shower axis in steps of 100 g @xmath46 .",
    "we have described the general procedure to search for earth - skimming and downward - going @xmath18-induced showers .",
    "however the two searches ( es and dg ) differ in several aspects that we describe in the following sections .      with monte carlo simulations of uhe propagating inside the earth",
    ", we have established that @xmath38 leptons above the energy threshold of the sd are efficiently produced only at zenith angles between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "for this reason , in the earth - skimming analysis we place very restrictive cuts to select only quasi - horizontal showers with largely elongated footprints : @xmath49 and @xmath50~{\\rm m~ns^{-1}}$ ] with rms(@xmath27)@xmath51 ( see table  [ tab : cuts ] ) .    in the es selection ,",
    "the neutrino identification variables include the fraction of stations with tot trigger and having aop@xmath52 for data prior to 31 may 2010 @xcite .",
    "this fraction is required to be above @xmath53 of the triggered stations in the event .",
    "the final choice of the values of these cuts was made by requiring zero background events in the training data sample , corresponding to @xmath54 of the events recorded up to that date .",
    "for data beyond 1 june 2010 a new methodology and a new set of efficient selection criteria was established based on an improved and enlarged library of es simulated @xmath16 events and on a larger period of training data . in particular",
    ", we used the average value of aop ( @xmath55aop@xmath56 ) over all the triggered stations in the event as the main observable to discriminate between hadronic showers and es neutrinos .",
    "the new methodology allows us to place the value of the cut on @xmath55aop@xmath56 using the tail of its distribution as obtained in real data ( which was seen to be consistent with an exponential shape as shown in fig .",

    "the selection of neutrino candidates in the zenith angle range @xmath20 ( dgl ) is more challenging since the electromagnetic component of background hadronic showers at ground increases as the zenith angle decreases because the shower crosses less atmosphere before reaching the detector level . out of all triggered stations of an event in this angular range , the ones closest to the shower core exhibit the highest discrimination power in terms of aop .",
    "in fact it has been observed in monte carlo simulations that the first triggered stations can still contain some electromagnetic component for background events and , for this reason , it is not desirable to use them for discrimination purposes .",
    "the last ones , even if they are triggered only by muons from a background hadronic shower , can exhibit large values of aop because they are far from the core where muons are known to arrive with a larger spread in time .",
