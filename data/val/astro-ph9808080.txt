    "the distance scale problem has been in the center of one of the most heated debates in astronomy this century and , despite enormous efforts , up to this day large systematic effects remain between several different distance indicators .",
    "following aaronson & mould ( 1986 ) , we recall that `` the ideal distance indicator : + 1",
    ". should satisfy small quantifiable dispersion ; + 2",
    ". should be measurable in enough galaxies so that it can be calibrated locally , and its intrinsic dispersion and systematic variation can be tested ; + 3 . should have a well defined physical basis ; + 4 . should be luminous enough to be useful at large distance . ''",
    "the microlensing surveys give us the opportunity to test the accuracy of primary distance indicators , such as cepheids , rrlyrae stars , the luminosity of the red clump , ... thanks to their systematic observations of millions of stars , it is possible to build complete catalogues of variable stars or color magnitude diagrams ( cmds hereafter ) in different galaxies of different metallicities and different star formation histories .",
    "heroic efforts from the ground ( pierce et al .",
    "1994 ) or with the hubble space telescope ( see other chapters in this volume ) give samples made of a few dozen of cepheids at maximum in a given very distant galaxy with a small number of epochs . on the contrary ,",
    "the microlensing surveys provides high accuracy light curves with extremely good phase coverage for periods of years for millions of stars ( thousands of cepheids and rrlyrae stars ) in different nearby galaxies .",
    "they provide strong constraints at different metallicities for the theory of stellar pulsation and stellar evolution .",
    "therefore they help our understanding of the physical basis of these distance indicators .",
    "they offer a very good basis for differential studies and for checking the consistency between the different primary distance indicators .",
    "following an original idea proposed with skepticism by einstein in 1936 and revived in 1964 by refsdal , paczynski ( 1986 ) suggested to probe our galactic halo via microlensing effects on stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "a compact object in the galactic halo passing close enough to the line of sight to a background star in the magellanic clouds induces an increase in the apparent brightness of the star .",
    "this phenomenon occurs owing to the alignment of the observer , the deflector , and the background star .",
    "if the total mass of our halo is in the form of compact objects , the probability of a star to be amplified by at least a factor 1.34 is @xmath0 . assuming a co - rotating halo , the time scale @xmath1 of an event is given by @xmath2 days where m is the mass of the deflector .",
    "therefore in order to be sensitive to a wide range of masses for compact objects , one should monitor millions of stars and be sensitive to events with time scale ranging from hours to years .",
    "the choice of a line of sight towards the lmc and one towards the smc would give information about the geometry of the halo ( sackett & gould , 1993 ) .",
    "moreover it is also interesting to monitor stars towards the galactic center .",
    "it provides a proof - of - principle for the experiment because microlensing is expected from the known faint end of the stellar luminosity function .",
    "moreover the probability of seeing machos is not much less than that expected towards the lmc . in the early nineties , the technology needed to perform such a search become available and three teams decided to enter the game : eros , macho and ogle .",
    "eros ( exprience de recherche dobjets sombres  aubourg et al .",
    "1993 ) is a collaboration between french astronomers and particle physicists .",
    "they adopted two strategies : the first involves the photographic monitoring of a 25 square degree field in the lmc using eso schmidt plates .",
    "exposures have been taken no more than nightly in two colors , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "about 380 plates have been taken between 1990 - 1994 .",
    "the second approach uses a 0.4 m f/10 reflecting telescope and a mosaic of 16 buttable ccds covering a field of @xmath5 degree centered in the bar of the lmc and in the main core of the smc . between 1991 and april 1994 ,",
    "about 15 000 images have been taken in two broad band filters , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and @xmath8 light curves with as many as 48 points a night have been obtained .    the macho collaboration ( massive compact halo objects  alcock et al .",
    "1993 ) has the dedicated use of a 1.27 m on mount stromlo ( australia ) .",
    "they equipped it with a prime focus reimager - corrector with a dichroic beam splitter which provides a 1@xmath9  field in two passbands simultaneously . in each beam",
    "they have one @xmath10 array of @xmath11 loral ccds covering 0.5 square degrees .",
    "they started the operation in 1992 with the lmc as prime target ( monitoring 9 million stars ) , then the bulge ( monitoring eleven million stars ) and the smc .",
    "they adopted a daily sampling rate , or a few points a week , to be sensitive to machos in the mass range @xmath12 .",
    "the observations will stop at the end of this millennium .",
    "ogle ( optical gravitational lensing experiment ",
    "udalski et al .",
    "1992 ) had on average 75 nights / year a 1 m telescope at their availability at las campanas ( chile ) between 1992 - 1995 .",
    "this telescope was equipped with a @xmath13 ford / loral ccd chip with a full frame of @xmath14 arcminutes .",
    "they used two filters , an i band filter which is closely related to gunn _ i _ and a v@xmath15 filter , though the vast majority was done in i. their primary objective was to search for microlensing events towards the galactic bulge .",
    "they monitored approximately two million stars in the galactic bulge and reported a total of 19 microlensing events in their first four seasons .",
    "the first microlensing events towards the lmc and the galactic bulge were announced almost simultaneously in october 1993 by eros , macho and ogle .",
    "now these event are discovered on a nearly daily basis toward the bulge and a dozen have been observed toward the lmc and the smc .",
    "another microlensing survey started soon after the three pioneers : duo ( disk unseen objects  alard & guibert 1997 ) .",
    "two hundred schmidt plates covering a field of 25 square degrees centered at the galactic coordinates b=-7@xmath9 , l=3@xmath9  have been taken in 1994 . despite the use of photographic plates ,",
    "this survey has been very successful thanks to a powerful photometric package developed specifically for the experiment ( alard 1996 ) .",
    "part of the eros schmidt plates have been reprocessed with this package and a catalogue of @xmath16 lmc rrlyrae will be released soon ( alard , beaulieu , lesquoy & hill , in progress ) .",
    "eros and ogle have been upgraded recently and entered the eros-2 and the ogle-2 phase .",
    "eros-2 uses the dedicated marly 1 m telescope at eso la silla .",
    "the prime focus is equipped with a focal reducer and a dichroic beam splitter with a mosaic of eight ccd @xmath11 in each channel .",
    "the total field is @xmath17@xmath9 .",
    "the collection of data started in july 1996 with the smc as prime target .",
    "eros-2 observes the lmc , smc , the galactic bulge ( with sampling rate daily , or few points a week ) .",
    "it performs a search for red dwarves by proper - motion measurements and a type ia supernova search .",
    "the second phase of the ogle project , ogle-2 , uses the new dedicated 1.3 m warsaw telescope at las campanas , which saw first light on february 1996 , with regular observations starting almost one year later . as described in udalski et al . (",
    "1997 ) the ccd camera used is a @xmath18 pixels in drift scan mode .",
    "in contrast to the first four pilot years , the ogle-2 team will be looking for microlensing not only in our own galaxy but also towards lmc and smc .",
    "the data flow is expected to increase 30 fold in comparison with ogle-1 .",
    "at least three other microlensing surveys appeared recently , but have not provided yet any non - microlensing results to our knowledge .",
    "vatt - columbia is searching microlensing in m31 by the image substraction technique ( tomaney 1997 ) .",
    "agape ( ansari et al . 1997 ) also observed m31 , but with a different technique called pixel lensing ( monitoring of the actual pixel flux ) .",
    "moa ( abe et al . , 1997 ) is a japan / new - zealand collaboration planning to search for microlensing towards the magellanic clouds and the galactic bulge . in 1995",
    "appeared two microlensing follow - up networks , planet ( albrow et al .",
    "1997 ) and gman ( closely related to macho ) .",
    "they are doing accurate , multi - site observations on on going microlensing events to detect anomalies in the light curves that could be due to blending , parallax , binaries , or planets . for details about the results of microlensing surveys ,",
    "see paczynski ( 1996 ) , ferlet & maillard ( 1997 ) , and the web sites listed in the bibliographic section .",
    "the real strength of microlensing experiments is to realize a systematic photometric survey of millions of stars over long period of time .",
    "however we should stress one of their general weaknesses : these experiments are specifically made to search for microlensing events .",
    "hence eros and macho adopted wide band filters in order to get more photons and therefore were able to monitor more stars improving the statistics for microlensing . in the case of the eros experiment for data taken between 1991 - 1995 ,",
    "the filters @xmath6 , @xmath7 can be transformed to the standard system ( v , i ) . however , the filters adopted for the eros-2 survey are the result of the convolution of the transmission of the dichroic in each path and the ccd response , giving a transmission of 420 - 720 nm and 620 - 920 nm .",
    "they are so wide that a reliable transformation between this system and a standard ubvri will be very difficult , or even impossible , to determine .",
    "macho also have very wide band filter system for reasons similar to eros and detailed calibrations have not been published yet .",
    "eros-2 and macho generate homogeneous very large databases in their own photometric system , but comparison with other observations , models , temperature calibrations , are not trivial at all .",
    "the strategy adopted by ogle and ogle-2 is much more attractive than the ones from macho and eros-2 from a non - microlensing point of view : they observe with standard filters and provide accurate calibrations in bvi for their catalogues .",
    "moreover ogle have made a real effort in order to make their data accessible as soon as possible .",
    "one example is the early release of a catalogue of bvi measurements of two millions stars in the central part of the smc as part of the ogle-2 survey .",
    "thanks to the systematic searching aspect of the microlensing surveys , large sample of primary distance indicators have been built in galaxies of different metallicities . in the case of the pulsating variable stars ,",
    "these large samples offer new tests to the theory of stellar pulsation / stellar evolution and opacity tables and therefore will help our understanding of these indicators .",
    "because the cepheid period luminosity relation is the corner stone of distance determination since the beginning of the century , most effort has been devoted to this class of variable stars .",
    "we will also present the current status of the different studies of rrlyrae variable stars .",
    "cepheids are young , intermediate mass ( typically @xmath19 ) , bright periodic variable stars .",
    "these stars have left the main sequence and are in a post core hydrogen - burning phase . because of this evolutionary stage , they lie in an area of the hr diagram , the so - called instability strip , where their envelopes are instable to kappa mechanism .",
    "they develope radial pulsations .",
    "their period of pulsation is correlated with their luminosity , and this period - luminosity relation ( pl ) has been used as the corner stone in deriving local distances , and extragalactic distances for decades .    a cepheid envelope is an acoustic cavity in which an infinity of modes of pulsation exist .",
    "however very few of them contribute to the dynamics of the system ; the unstable modes and the marginally stable modes coupled by resonances to unstable modes .",
    "resonances are known to play an important role in shaping the light curves .",
    "therefore an analysis of the shape of the light curves will give us some information about the dynamics of these stars and about the resonances between pulsational modes .",
    "two large cepheid catalogues were built from eros observations ( 550 cepheids in the lmc and the smc ",
    "beaulieu & sasselov 1997 and references therein ) , macho observations ( 1466 cepheids in the lmc ",
    "welch et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) and from a pilot campaign of eros-2 observations ( @xmath20900 lmc and smc cepheids ",
    "bauer et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "it was known for years that the cepheids divide into two groups , the classical cepheids with rather high amplitude , asymmetric curve , and the so - called s - cepheids , with low - amplitude symmetric light curves . following the suggestion of antonello et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , beaulieu et al . (",
    "1995 ) showed that this morphological classification is mirrored by a dichotomy in the period - luminosity plane : the classical cepheids are fundamental pulsators whereas s - cepheids are first overtone pulsators .",
    "just on the basis of the light curve shape , it is possible to distinguish between cepheids pulsating in different modes .      in our galaxy , the lmc , and the smc , we observed the hertzsprung progression of the changing form of cepheid light curves due to a 2:1 resonance between the fundamental and the second overtone ( also known as the bump cepheids ) .",
    "this resonance takes place at @xmath21 days in our galaxy . using data obtained by the macho , eros , and eros-2",
    ", the resonance takes place between 10.5 - 12 days .",
    "the resonance in the smc takes place in the range 10.5 - 13.5 days ( the upper value being poorly constrained ) .    the s - cepheids ( first overtone pulsators )",
    "have been observed in the three galaxies .",
    "they present the same evolution of light curve with period , alleged to be the signature of a 2:1 resonance between the first and the fourth overtone .",
    "it takes place at @xmath22 days in our galaxy , @xmath23 days in the lmc , and @xmath24 days in the smc .",
    "one can notice that unlike for fundamental pulsators , the resonance is taking place at shorter periods when going to lower metallicity .",
    "so far 73 beat cepheids have been found in the lmc by macho ( welch et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) , eleven in the smc by eros ( beaulieu et al . 1997 ) and fourteen are known in our galaxy ( pardo & poretti 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "they are pulsating either in the fundamental and first overtone mode ( f/1ot hereafter ) or the first and second overtone mode ( 1ot/2ot hereafter ) .",
    "the smc 1ot/2ots are very similar to the lmc ones while the smc f/1ots have period ratios systematically higher than the lmc ones by @xmath25 which are systematically higher than the galactic ones by @xmath25 .      with two kinds of beat cepheids , plus the two resonance constraints on the classical cepheids and the s - cepheids observed at different metallicities , we are probing different depths in the cepheid envelopes , and drawing new strong constraints ( similar to helioseismology ) for the theory of stellar pulsation , stellar evolution and the opacity tables at low metallicities .",
    "when going to lower metallicity , the @xmath2010 days resonance for fundamental cepheids occurs at longer periods , whereas the resonance at @xmath203 days for overtones occurs at shorter and shorter period .",
    "the period ratios of f/1ot beat cepheids increases when decreasing the metallicity , whereas they are the same for 1ot/2ot for lmc and smc .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", one has to keep in mind that when going to lower metallicities , the evolutionary models will increase the luminosity at a fixed mass .",
    "the increase of mass will lead to a diminution of the calculated period ratios .",
    "however when going to lower metallicity , the opacity bump that drives the pulsation will be smaller and therefore will increase the period ratios for a fixed mass and luminosity .",
    "however since the different modes of pulsations are probing different depth in the cepheid envelope , the net effect will be different from mode to mode .",
    "the final result , the observed position of a resonance center will be a combination of these antagonistic effects ( plus a possible non - linear shift , particularly in the case of resonance coupled modes ) .    the determination of the cepheids masses has been a long standing problem .",
    "serious discrepancies existed between masses from evolutionary theory and pulsation theory .",
    "the well - known mass problem of the cepheids ( for a review , see cox 1980 ) led simon to suggest a revision of the opacities ( simon 1982 ; andreasen 1988 ) . the use of improved opacities ( opal  iglesias et al .",
    "1992 ; op  seaton et al .",
    "1994 ) has substantially decreased the mass discrepancy but not totally removed it .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the bump cepheids have revealed a strong sensitivity to the recent opacities and the mixture .",
    "( moskalik et al .",
    "1992 , simon & kambur 1994 ) .",
    "the strong sensitivity to opacities makes it a useful tool to test the opacities at different metallicities using extragalactic cepheids .",
    "the presence of two pulsating modes in the envelope of a cepheid gives an anchor for pulsation theory : it is possible to obtain the luminosity and the mass independently of any evolutionary model , given the temperature and the chemical composition .",
    "buchler et al . (",
    "1996 ) showed that the implication of the 2:1 resonance between the fundamental and the second overtone around ten days for the bump cepheids , the alleged resonance around three days for the s - cepheids are difficult to reconcile with the envelope models at low metallicity ( z=0.01 and z=0.004 ) with the opal93 opacities .",
    "when going to lower metallicities the derived masses are too small .",
    "the discrepancy increases when decreasing the metallicity .",
    "whereas a single mass - luminosity relation ( ml ) is able to reproduce the extend of the instability strip , there remains some discrepancy for the bump cepheids of the galaxy , i.e. the mass still differs by @xmath2010% as compared to evolutionary models using the same set of opal opacity tables . this discrepancy",
    "( whatever its origin ) can be quantified as an increase of the overshoot parameter .",
    "however an increase of the overshoot parameter in the evolutionary models ( suggested by chiosi et al .",
    "1993 as a solution of the cepheid mass problem ) will be in strong disagreement with other observational constraints .",
    "in contrast for the lmc and the smc , not only the zero point of the ml leads to disagreement with evolutionary models mass discrepancy of about @xmath26 but single ml relation can not render count of the width of the instability strip .",
    "the opal95 version includes several improvements among which the incorporation of seven additional chemical elements of the iron group have been resulted in a further increase of the opacities ( 20% ) compared to the opal93 version in the region of the z - bump which is relevant for the cepheids .",
    "a similar survey done with this new set of opacities shows that the situation improved , but the discrepancy is not removed .",
    "meanwhile the results coming from survey of radiative hydromodels at low metallicity suggest that a strong dissipative mechanism is missing in the envelopes .",
    "some studies have been focusing on the beat cepheids at different metallicities ( morgan & welch 1997 ; christensen - dalsgaard & petersen 1995 ; antonello et al .",
    "1997 ; baraffe et al .",
    "1998 ) . in these studies",
    "several mass - luminosities relation from evolutionary calculations or ad hoc choices are adopted , linear stability analysis of the envelope with pure radiative , of convection with mixing length theory are performed .",
    "then they generally concludes that they beat - cepheids period - period ratio planes are reasonably well reproduced for the galaxy , lmc , smc metallicities .",
    "in fact , using their iterative code , buchler et al .",
    "( 1996 ) showed that at best beat cepheids give weak constraints on mass luminosity relation .",
    "they provide a useful set of tests for stellar pulsation theory , but they can not be used as a strong constraint on ml relations , unlike the ten - day resonance .",
    "several attempts to model the resonance at @xmath203 days for overtone pulsators using radiative hydro models ( buchler , private communication ; antonello & aikawa 1995 ) have so far failed , showing unphysical  spikes \" in the light curves .    the second overtone mode has been observed in beat cepheids .",
    "therefore it is natural to ask the question whether single mode second overtone pulsators exist .",
    "no answer has been given yet from an observational point of view , but antonello & kanbur ( 1997 ) made a survey of hydro models to study these hypothetical stars and predict resonance positions and characteristics of the light curves ( but again with unphysical features in the light curves ) .",
    "over these last years , it has become increasingly clear that there are a number of severe problems with radiative models ( cf .",
    "buchler 1998 ) .",
    "a strong dissipative mechanism is missing in the envelope calculations .",
    "the inclusion of a recipe of turbulent convection in stellar envelopes ( gehmeyr & winkel 1992 ; bono & stellingwerf 1994 ; bono & marconi 1998 ; yecko et al .",
    "1998 ) is promising .",
    "the implementation of a relaxation method to obtain non - linear periodic pulsation and stability analysis of the limit cycles is much more powerful than very time consuming and sometimes inconclusive hydrodynamic integrations .",
    "the first hydro models of beat cepheids ever computed ( kollth et al .",
    "1998 ) reproduce period ratio , modal amplitude and their ratios thanks to full hydrodynamic integration and the relaxation method .",
    "after 30 years of failure with radiative models , it turns out that the beat cepheid phenomenon is natural and very robust once turbulent convection is implemented .",
    "moreover preliminary results show that the cepheid mass problem is removed ( beaulieu et al .",
    ", in preparation ) for the smc and lmc metallicities .",
    "thanks to the new constraints raised by the microlensing surveys at different metallicities , significant progress has been made on the theory of stellar pulsation .",
    "we feel that turbulent convection puts the nail in the coffin of cepheid radiative models ...",
    "several efforts are on going in a try to produce a theoretical calibration of the cepheid pl relation at different metallicities .",
    "it is definitively a difficult challenge , involving up to date opacity tables , proper set of evolutionary models for the different metallicities , stellar envelope calculations taking into account the different constraints given by the position of the resonance centers and the beat cepheids at different metallicities .",
    "once * all * these constraints on the modelisation of the envelope have been met successfully , then stellar atmosphere calculations have to be performed and `` put on top '' of the stellar pulsation calculations .",
    "currently ( and for the next few years ) these would have to be static atmosphere calculations .",
    "the complete modelisation of a dynamic envelope and atmosphere of a cepheid is currently still a dream .    the classical study of chiosi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) has been the reference for distance scale studies over the last years .",
    "they computed a large grid of cepheid models varying mass , effective temperature , initial chemical composition ( galaxy , lmc , smc , ... ) and mass - luminosity relations ( with mild or large core overshoot ) .",
    "the linear non - adiabatic stability analysis of the cepheid envelopes with a treatment of convection by the mixing length theory was performed , using the ( now obsolete ) los alamos opacities .",
    "they derived relations between luminosity , effective temperature and ubvri magnitudes by using theoretical atmosphere models . among the results from their survey ,",
    "they show that the cepheid pl show a small dependence of metallicity if one uses the v and i bands , whereas the dependence is important if one uses b and v. this work has been quoted extensively and used as a strong case to neglect metallicity effects on the cepheid pl when using v and i photometry . however , it is worth mentioning that nonlinear , nonlocal and time - dependent convective pulsating models are needed to predict accurate determinations of both blue and red edges of the cepheid instability strip and that we should wait for these models to have a good theoretical understanding of metallicity effects on the pl relations .",
    "baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) present a systematic survey of evolutionary models and pulsational models in an effort to provide a theoretical calibration of the cepheid pl relation at different metallicities .",
    "they performed an extensive survey of evolutionary calculations for masses in the range @xmath27 for z=0.02 , 0.01 , 0.008 , 0.004 .",
    "the evolutionary calculations are coupled with a linear - non - adiabatic stability analysis with standard mixing length theory .",
    "they reproduce the period - period ratio diagrams for beat cepheids with good agreement , on the other hand they do not comments on the position of the resonance centers obtained by their modeling .",
    "bono & marconi ( 1998 ) adopted the same ml relation for different metallicities , because they consider that the uncertainty connected with the helium fraction and the heavy elements in the ml relation , are of the same order as the decrease / increase in the luminosity caused by the metal abundance .",
    "then they compute a survey of hydro models including non linear non local time dependent turbulent convection , derive observable quantities from static stellar atmosphere models , and provide a theoretical calibration of the cepheid pl at different metallicities . even if several uncertainties remain in the evolutionary calculations ,",
    "the difference of metallicity will imply systematic shifts in the ml relations which will have a direct impact on any attempt to derive a theoretical pl relation .",
    "low - mass stars ( @xmath28 ) descending the red giant branch ( rgb ) and having a rather thin envelope will settle on the horizontal branch ( hb ) after the onset of he core burning .",
    "these stars are liable to envelope instabilities .",
    "these instabilities are driven by he ionization zone and result in radial pulsations .",
    "the evolutionary loci in the h - r diagram where these stars are found is termed the instability strip .",
    "the instable region in the h - r diagram depends on the stars exact chemical composition and mass .",
    "these rrlyrae variables which are often found within globular clusters ( hence the synonym : cluster variables ) are of the low metallicity population ii and have periods ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 days with amplitudes below two magnitudes .",
    "their behavior form an excellent opportunity for developing and testing current ideas on pulsation theories , stellar hb evolution and hb morphology .    as with the cepheid case",
    "one can distinguish different kinds of subtypes , depending on the exact mode in which the stars are pulsating .",
    "phenomenologically one can distinguish these types on the basis of their lightcurves and periods .",
    "using fourier decomposition , the observed population of rrlyrae stars are differentiated into four basic types .",
    "stars of type rrab are the fundamental mode pulsators , type rrc constitute the first overtone pulsators , and type rrd are double mode pulsators .",
    "fourier decomposition is a powerful tool in addressing the classification method , though good phase coverage and marginal errors of a lightcurve are required for optimal efficiency of this method .",
    "the internal constitution of the rrlyrae variable stars and the way the instabilities cause the radial pulsations are reasonably well understood though understanding of a view long standing problems still remain .",
    "one of these phenomena is the well known elusive variation of the light curve of rrab s in amplitude and shape , the blazhko effect .",
    "different models have been proposed , like cousens ( 1983 ) of the oblique magnetic rotator and moskalik s ( 1985 ) of mode resonances , but none has been appreciated yet . but generally speaking the rrlyrae stars form a very important distance indicator for globular clusters , lmc and galaxies within the local group , due to their regular pulsation mode and their absolute brightness of approximately + 0.8 magnitudes .",
    "a good calibration for the absolute visual magnitudes with the pulsation period is of cardinal importance for global distance indications .",
    "a synthetic correlation ( pulsation equation ) of the pulsation period of the star to its stellar parameters , p@xmath29=p@xmath29(l , t@xmath30,m ) , was reported in the classic paper by van albada & baker ( 1971 ) , marking the start of the controversy between the luminosity of hb stars derived from evolution theory and from pulsation theory . in view of this",
    "an important discovery was made by sandage ( 1982 ) , which is termed the sandage - period - shift : the increase of the rrlyrae pulsation period with a decrease of the metallicity .    in the following years",
    "extensive studies have been devoted to the calibration of the rrlyrae absolute luminosity and the parameters it depends on , observationally as well as computationally .",
    "one of the main objectives is to find the dependency of m@xmath31 on [ fe / h ] ( rood 1990 ; sandage 1993 ; carney , storm & jones 1992 ) and where it is shown by caputo ( 1997 ) that this relation is dependent on the exact morphology of the hb which is quantified by lee ( 1989 ) in the parameter @xmath32 , where b , r , and v are the number of red , blue and variable hb stars .",
    "she uses synthetic hb computations to predict the edges of the instability strip and computes the masses from globular clusters with known [ fe / h ] and hb morphology . in this way",
    "an estimate for their distance modulus is made .",
    "an observational technique for an empirical absolute magnitude calibration is presented by kovcs and jurcsik ( 1997 ) .",
    "they attempt to derive a linear equation for the distance moduli of the rrab stars on the basis of correlations between fourier parameters and @xmath33 , through the basic fact that the lightcurve is in some way related to the stellar parameters and thus should be reflection of them .",
    "series of elaborate theoretical investigations have been devoted to develope theoretical models on the behavior of these kinds of stars by bono et al .",

    "however the apparent success of hydrodynamical models simulating rrab stars has been challenged by kovcs & kanbur ( 1998 ) .",
    "they show that a overwhelming majority of the models tested does not follow the empirical relations derived from observations ( e.g. kovcs & jurcsik 1997 ) regarding the shape of the light curves and the physical parameters .",

    "gieren et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used the near - infrared barnes - evans surface brightness technique with a zero point of the surface brightness color relation determined from a large set of interferometrically determined angular diameters of cool giants and supergiants ( fouqu & gieren 1997 ) .",

    "krockenberger et al .",
    "( 1997 ) developed a new approach of the baade - wesselink method : using hr spectrum and hydro models of cepheid atmospheres they have good understanding of the dynamics of the asymmetry of the spectral lines , and therefore can provide very accurate radial velocity curves .",
    "they want to reduce the systematic errors in the measurement of the surface brightness and the temperature by the use of hr spectrum ( instead of color indexes ) .",
    "they then adopt a rigorous statistical approach to determine properly the radius and the distance of the target stars .",
    "first overtone pulsators from the eros microlensing survey have been observed , and preliminary results presented ( krockenberger et al .",
    "the lmc distance could be determine with an accuracy of 3% . in the near future",

    "1998 ; stanek et al .",
    "1998a ) and keck spectroscopy .",
    "jorgensen & petersen ( 1967 ) were the first to recognize the possibilities a double mode pulsating star would open . as they write in their paper",
    ", these stars create the opportunity to make a mass estimation founded on the ratio of the periods of first overtone to fundamental mode ( by means of the petersen diagram ( pd ) , which couples @xmath37 to @xmath38 on the absiscae ) .",

    "( 1997 ) and the assumption of a similarity between the temperature of rrlyrae stars at the blue edge ( sandage 1993a&b ) of the instability strip and the temperature of the rrd s , to arrive at a pl relation .",
    "finally a distance measurement of the lmc is straightforward , setting the multimode pulsating rrd based @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "we recall that the lmc distance based on single mode rrlyrae ( cf .",

    "however , presently available theoretical predictions , suggest that the slopes of the pl relation are independent of metallicity , only the zero - point is affected , and the metallicity effect depend o band pass .",

    "observational studies have been made since the 70s .",
    "for example , an intrinsic color shift between lmc and smc cepheids has been pointed out clearly ( martin et al . 1979 ) .",
    "an empirical search for a metallicity effect ( freedman & madore 1990 ; gould 1994 ) in three fields of m31 with 36 cepheids and 152 bvri measurements have led to ambiguous results : freedman & madore claimed that there is no significant effect .",
    "gould reanalyzed their data with a better statistical treatment taking into account the high degree of correlation between the measurements and found an effect .",

    "they adopted an lmc true distance modulus of 18.5 mag , a mean reddening of @xmath54 and a galactic extinction law with @xmath55 .",
    "the model then has twelve parameters which are : a linear fit of the pl relation , a linear fit of the instability strip , the distance difference , the relative reddening difference and a metallicity dependence on the zero point of the pl relation .",
