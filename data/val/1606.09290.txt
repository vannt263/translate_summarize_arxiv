    "although the proposed schemes allow us to create any desired w state , we lack ideal conditions regarding experimental realization for the sophisticated structure of these methods .",
    "one of the drawbacks of our setup is that as the size of @xmath1 state gets larger , the number of required gates increases quadratically .",

    ", we have shown that the number of @xmath28 gates is @xmath32 .",

    "successful creation probability is very low , even for a three - qubit @xmath1 state with a success probability of the order of @xmath36 .",

    "@xcite pointed out that weak cross - kerr nonlinearities are more useful to construct a @xmath0 gate with fewer physical resources than other linear optical schemes .",

    "there are also other methods to realize a @xmath0 gate using superconductors @xcite and ion - trap systems @xcite .",
    "another experimental imperfection is that , for @xmath2 is very large , the process may lead to failure case since a few degrees of deviation in angle changes the outcome , which means desired @xmath1 state is not created .",
    "for example , to create a @xmath1 state of @xmath37 qubits , we need to set the angle at @xmath38 for the first @xmath6 .",

    "theoretically , we here assume that the angle setting is adjusted as required for a @xmath1-state of @xmath2 qubits .",
    "the precision of angles will be a challenging issue for experimentalists .",
    "also , the effect of photon loss ( the amplitude damping channel ) may lead to experimental imperfections as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we should also take into account the practical source of single photons to consider the feasibility of the proposed schemes .",
    "parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) is a common and well - known method to generate single - photon states , and has been discussed for the scheme expanding polarization entangled @xmath1 states @xcite .",
    "suppose that single photons are generated from pdc with rate @xmath41 , three single photons required for the preparation of a three - qubit @xmath1 state are generated with rate @xmath42 . in this case , the undesirable events usually occur due to the generation of an extra photon pair , with rate @xmath43 which is @xmath44 .",
    "such events occur with rate @xmath45 , which is very small compared with the rate @xmath46",
    ". it can be generalized to the case of n - photon @xmath1-state creation , which gives the rates of the desired events and errors , @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "as in the simplest example of three - photon @xmath1-state creation , the rate of errors is small compared with the rate of the desired events .",
    "we have presented three optical setups that create @xmath1 states of three , four and five qubits deterministically .",
    "we then showed that a @xmath1 state of any size can be created deterministically by enhancing the network .",
    "we also derived the formula for the number of gates needed for this processing .",
    "an important capability of our proposal is that it can be used to obtain any @xmath1 state using a number of gates depending on the size of the desired resultant @xmath1 state .",
    "also , we only need two - qubit gates , @xmath28 and @xmath0 , making our setup more applicable because we do not use any three- or more - qubit gates . the implementation of the @xmath0 gate has been well characterized in the literature .",
