    "cool , low - mass stars dominate the stellar census @xcite , yet they remain elusive and enigmatic objects .",
    "because of their small size and cool surface temperature , nearby members of our solar neighborhood are still being discovered via proper motion surveys @xcite and parallaxes are being determined for these new stellar neighbors @xcite . furthermore , the low - mass stars we do know about are not well understood .",
    "their fundamental properties are difficult to measure and do not adequately constrain atmospheric and interior stellar models .",
    "in addition to effective temperature and mass , the size of field stars at the cool end of the main sequence is arguably one of the most difficult properties to determine .",
    "there are currently only two methods to measure directly the stellar radii of cool dwarfs : light curve and radial velocity studies of double - lined eclipsing binaries and long - baseline interferometry of single stars .",
    "the former method is biased toward main sequence stars larger than the sun @xcite , and the latter toward brighter and larger giants and supergiants . within the past ten years",
    ", cooler and smaller stars are being added to the database of stars with known fundamental properties .",
    "there are sixteen known m - dwarfs that are members of eclipsing binaries for which we have have stellar radii : both components of gj 2069a @xcite , both components of cm dra @xcite , both components of cu cnc @xcite , both components of yy gem and one component of v818 tau @xcite , both components of bw3 v38 @xcite , one component of rxj2130.6 + 4710 @xcite , both components of tresher0 - 07621 @xcite , and both components of gu boo @xcite . from long - baseline optical interferometry ,",
    "the situation is more bleak as there heretofore were only seven m dwarfs ( gj 15a , gj 191 , gj 205 , gj 411 , gj 551 , gj 699 , and gj 997 ) for which stellar radii have been measured @xcite .",
    "here we report on measurements of the angular diameters of six m dwarfs .",
    "we obtained these measurements from observations made with the center for high angular resolution astronomy ( chara ) array , a 6-element optical / near - infrared interferometer located at mount wilson observatory , california . from these measurements , we deduce the linear sizes and further refine the mass  radius relation .",
    "in addition , we calculate their surface gravities and effective temperatures .",
    "this paper is the fourth in a series of commissioning science observations with the chara array .",
    "the other three papers vary in topic from the rapid rotators regulus @xcite and alderamin @xcite to an overview of the chara array @xcite .",
    "the majority of observations were completed in 2004 june , while others were mixed into the standard queue observing throughout the end of 2003 and most of 2004 .",
    "all observations were made using the @xmath1 filter ( @xmath2 m , @xmath3 m ; note that the central wavelength for the filter alone differs slightly from the system effective wavelength adopted by @xcite , but the difference has a negligible effect on our results ) .",
    "data for gj 15a were obtained using the most western and eastern telescopes ( w1 and e1 , respectively ) and for gj 880 using the inner southern telescope ( s2 ) and w1 .",
    "the data for the remaining targets were observed with the most southern telescope ( s1 ) and e1 .",
    "the maximum baseline separations between these telescopes are 314 meters for w1-e1 , 249 meters for s2-w1 , and 331 meters for s1-e1 . in these configurations ,",
    "angular diameters as small as 0.5 milliarcsecond ( mas ) can readily be measured at the @xmath1 spectral band .",
    "targets were chosen from the gliese and jahrei  catalog @xcite based on color ( @xmath4 ) and distance ( parallax @xmath5 mas ) such that their predicted angular size exceeded 0.4 mas .",
    "targets also had to be within the detection limits of the instrument ( @xmath6 for tip - tilt correction , @xmath7 for image acquisition , and @xmath8 for the near - ir detector ) .",
    "table  [ tbl - obs ] is a summary of the observations for this paper .",
    "column 1 is the gliese and jahrei  catalog designation , column 2 is the luyten half - second ( lhs ) catalog designation @xcite , column 3 gives the name of the calibrator star , column 4 indicates the telescope pair ( and baseline ) used , column 5 gives the ut observation date , and column 6 gives the number of observations .",
    "measurements of all but gj 15a were taken using the `` chara classic '' beam combiner .",
    "it is a two - beam , pupil - plane ( or michelson ) combiner utilizing path length modulation ; details of the instrumentation and configuration are given by @xcite .",
    "gj 15a was observed with fluor , a single - mode fiber beam combiner designed by collaborators at the paris observatory @xcite , because it was the available instrument at the time and the target was within its sensitivity limits .",
    "the calibrator for gj 15a was hd 2952 , and was chosen from the `` calibrator stars for 200 m baseline interferometry '' catalog @xcite , which includes corrections for limb darkening . while fluor benefits from spatially cleaned beams ,",
    "the `` chara classic '' beam combiner has greater sensitivity .",
    "hence the two instruments complement each other in this respect .",
    "the same near - ir detector was at the back end of each beam combiner .",
    "the fringe sampling frequency was either 100 or 150 hz , depending on the seeing conditions and source brightness .",
    "for the same reasons , either 1 or @xmath9 pixels were read out .",
    "the camera readout was adjusted to maintain five samples per fringe .",
    "each merged data scan from `` chara classic '' was formed from 200 scans with photometric calibration scans made before and after .",
    "photometric calibration scans for fluor are performed during the scan on separate fiber channels .",
    "atmospheric and instrumental coherence losses were estimated by interleaving measurements of unresolved stars or stars with known angular diameters .",
    "calibrators were chosen using the _ gcweb _ utility available online from the michelson science center .",
    "we restricted our selection to main sequence stars with estimated angular sizes less than 0.4 mas , which yields visibility amplitudes greater than 90% when measured with the s1-e1 baseline in the @xmath1-band .",
    "the calibrator observations were in close proximity on the sky ( within @xmath10 ) and in time ( within 30 minutes ) to each source observation .",
    "the typical duty cycle from the start of one observation to the start of the next was approximately 10 minutes .",
    "the reduction algorithms developed for data from the chara array are described in detail by @xcite .",
    "we employed a commonly used technique of integrating the power of each fringe scan @xcite , but we removed the variance term resulting from atmospheric turbulence .",
    "the resulting quantity is the visibility amplitude ( @xmath11 ) , and not the more common @xmath12 .",
    "data from gj 15a and its calibrator were analyzed by methods specific to the fluor instrument @xcite and the following description does not pertain .    the calibrated visibility amplitude of the science object ( @xmath13 ) was calculated using the relation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the interferometer s efficiency and @xmath16 is the instrumental visibility amplitude of the science object as measured on the sky . by interleaving measurements of a calibrator of known angular size and thus a known calibrated visibility amplitude , one can measure @xmath15 via the ratio of the instrumental to calibrated visibility amplitude , or @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , if the calibrator is unresolved , @xmath18 is unity , and @xmath15 is measured directly",
    ". however , the high resolution at long baselines and instrument sensitivity limitations significantly reduce the number of available unresolved sources , especially within close proximity to the science object .",
    "therefore , we were left to use slightly resolved calibrators and to determine @xmath18 through other means .      from conservation of energy , the true limb - darkened angular diameter of a star ( @xmath19 ) is related to ratio of the stellar flux reaching the top of the earth s atmosphere ( @xmath20 ) at wavelength @xmath21 to the flux leaving the stellar surface ( @xmath22 ) : @xmath23 @xmath22 is determined from stellar model atmospheres and @xmath20 from extinction - corrected photometry and absolute spectrophotmetry .",
    "this was an idea first proposed by @xcite and later refined by @xcite .",
    "a potential source of error in @xmath22 is the uncertainty in determining the correct input parameters for the model atmosphere .",
    "for example , if the effective temperature ( @xmath24 ) , metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) , and/or surface gravity ( @xmath25 ) are not well known , there can be difficulty in choosing the correct model . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "the infrared region is less sensitive to model input approximations than the visible  hence the method to derive angular diameters from infrared photometry is known as the infrared flux ( irf ) method . because our observations were obtained in the @xmath1-band , our derived radii measurements are relatively unaffected by problems related to limb darkening and/or absorption line contamination .",
    "we selected model atmospheres from @xcite and linearly interpolated the fluxes between @xmath24 grid points .",
    "we adopted @xmath26 , which is appropriate for mid - temperature dwarf stars , and assumed the metallicity to be solar .",
    "however , changing @xmath25 and/or the metallicity did not significantly effect the resulting @xmath19 .",
    "the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog @xcite provided the near - ir broad - band photometry data , which were then transformed to fluxes @xcite",
    ". a weighted fit of the 2mass photometry to the model flux yielded angular diameters less than 0.4 mas and typical errors of 4 - 5% ( figure  [ fig - irf ] ) . for calibrators with such small angular size , the propagated fractional error in the target angular diameter is much lower than this percentage @xcite .",
    "we list the names and adopted parameters of the calibrator stars in table  [ tbl - cal ] , and our derived @xmath19 values are given there in column 5 .",
    "the irf method yields @xmath19 .",
    "however , it is common practice to fit a visibility function for a uniform disk angular diameter ( @xmath27 ) , which is given by @xmath28 and depends on the projected baseline ( @xmath29 ) and the effective wavelength ( @xmath30 ) . in order to compute the efficiency ( @xmath15 ) from the measured visibility of the calibrator ( @xmath31 ) , we need to transform @xmath19 into an equivalent @xmath27 that has the same visibility amplitude at",
    "the observed projected baseline and wavelength . to do this",
    ", we calculated a correction factor ( @xmath32 ) based on @xmath24 , metallicity @xcite , and the transmission of the @xmath1-filter @xcite . these correction factors ( table  [ tbl - cal ] , column  6 ) result in slightly smaller ( @xmath33 ) diameters for equivalent uniform disks .",
    "because calibrator measurements were not made simultaneously with object measurements , we linearly interpolated in time between the values of @xmath31 immediately before and after each @xmath16 .",
    "we then used the calibrator @xmath27 and the known values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 to compute @xmath18 . from @xmath31 and @xmath18",
    ", we determined the instrumental efficiency ( @xmath15 ) for visibility measurement .",
    "typically values of @xmath15 ranged from @xmath34 to @xmath35 and varied by only a few percent over the course of the night .",
    "this can be attributed to the stability of the system and habitual realignment of the optics before every observation . finally , from eq .  [ eq : cal_vis ] , we determined the calibrated visibility amplitudes ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "table  [ tbl - visibilities ] lists the modified julian dates ( mjd ) , projected baselines , and visibility amplitudes ( with error estimates ) associated with the mid - point time of observation for each dwarf star .",
    "errors in calibrator angular size ( @xmath36[sect - irfm ] ) and visibility amplitudes were propagated to the calibrated visibility amplitude error estimates .",
    "we can determine the stellar radius from the angular diameter and parallax in two ways .",
    "first , we can assume that the stars are uniform disks and then fit the fringe visibility as a function of baseline using eq .",
    "[ eq : vis_ud ] .",
    "this estimate of @xmath27 is given in column  2 of table  [ tbl - derived ] .",
    "however , we know that real stars are limb darkened ( by a small amount in the @xmath1-band ) , so that their actual , limb darkened diameters will be slightly larger than the uniform disk diameters ( see table  [ tbl - cal ] ) . in principle , it is no harder to fit a limb darkened visibility curve to the observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  6 ) , but to do so we first need to establish the stellar parameters in order to obtain the appropriate @xmath1-band limb darkening law from stellar atmosphere models .",
    "we approached this problem as follows .",
    "@xcite has tabulated limb darkening coefficients for the near - ir that are based upon solar metallicities .",
    "we chose the coefficients calculated using the phoenix code for modeling stellar atmospheres ( table 38 from @xcite ) .",
    "the limb darkening relations are listed as functions of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we can determine these parameters using an iterative scheme that is based upon sequential improvements in the radius estimate .",
    "we start with a stellar radius estimate derived from the uniform disk angular diameter ( column  2 of table  [ tbl - derived ] ) and the parallax from the nstars database .",
    "nstars parallaxes are the weighted means of all currently available parallaxes , including those of hipparcos and the yale parallax catalog .",
    "then we use the stefan - boltzmann relation to find @xmath24 from the bolometric luminosity and radius .",
    "we determined the bolometric luminosity from the absolute @xmath37 magnitude using a bolometric correction based on the @xmath38 color index ( derived from spectral energy distribution fits of m - stars by @xcite ) .",
    "we used absolute @xmath37 magnitudes calculated from nstars parallaxes and 2mass k magnitudes and @xmath38 color indices from @xcite to find the luminosities given in column 5 of table  [ tbl - derived ] , which were then used to find @xmath24 from the assumed stellar radius .",
    "we adopted @xmath39 erg  s@xmath40 and @xmath41 in this calculation , and the scatter in the bolometric correction relation results in a luminosity error of @xmath42  dex .",
    "next we used estimates of the stellar mass ( column 4 of table  [ tbl - dwarfs ] ) with the assumed radius to find @xmath25 .",
    "stellar masses were estimated using the @xmath37-band mass  luminosity relation of @xcite , which have a typical error of @xmath43 . with",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath25 set , we then found the limb darkening law from @xcite and made a least - squares error - weighted fit of the limb - darkened visibility curve to the observations to obtain the limb darkened angular size @xmath19 .",
    "we repeated the process and revised the temperature and gravity estimates by estimating a new radius from @xmath19 and parallax , and then fitted the visibilities again with the revised limb darkened visibility curve . in practice",
    "this procedure converged ( with negligible parameter differences between iterations ) in only two iterations because the ir limb darkening is only slightly different from a uniform disk and is relatively insensitive to the adopted temperature and gravity .",
    "in fact , a 1-@xmath45 change in the adopted temperature and gravity has no detectable effect on @xmath19 .",
    "our final values of @xmath19 , reduced chi - squared ( @xmath46 ) , stellar radius , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are listed in table  [ tbl - derived ] and the fitted , limb darkened visibility curves are plotted with the observations in figure  [ fig - ld_vis ] .",
    "the fractional errors in the derived temperatures are approximately one half the fractional errors in the radii or about @xmath47 , and the errors in @xmath25 amount to approximately @xmath48  dex ( as derived from the errors in fractional mass and radius ) .",
    "changing these parameters by one standard deviation does not effect the radius determinations at the precision we are reporting them .",
    "the one inconsistency in this method is that we have relied on the solar abundance atmospheric models from @xcite to estimate the limb darkening , while some of our targets are somewhat metal poor ( column  3 , table  [ tbl - dwarfs ] ) .",
    "it will be interesting to revisit our calculations when limb darkening results for metal poor atmospheres are eventually developed , but we doubt that our radius results will change significantly because the limb darkening corrections are small .",
    "we found that the values of @xmath46 ( given in column 4 of table [ tbl - derived ] ) exceeded the expected value of unity for all the targets except gj  15a and gj  880 ( the small value for gj  15a probably results from our sample of two measurements ) .",
    "thus , the internal visibility amplitude errors associated with an individual data set underestimate the full error budget , and consequently , we used the observed scatter from the fits to rescale the minimum , best - fit value of @xmath46 to unity .",
    "we added a 6% noise floor to account for the night - to - night fluctuation in angular diameter measurement , as calculated from objects with multi - night observations .",
    "this term was added in quadrature to the statistical error .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig - gj752a ] the distribution of the fractional deviations from the fit for gj  752a , the target with the most observations .",
    "we also plot a linear regression fit of the residuals that has a non - zero slope which is set by a few outlying points from two nights ( 2004 june 13 - 14 ) .",
    "the 6% noise floor also accounts for this slight linear trend seen in these commissioning observations .",
    "we also determined effective temperatures by a direct comparison of the observed and predicted fluxes in the @xmath37-band based upon the observed angular diameters .",
    "we used the 2mass @xmath49 band magnitudes and the adopted flux zero - point from @xcite to form the following relation : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the model flux ( erg  @xmath52  s@xmath40  @xmath40 ) averaged over the 2mass @xmath49 filter response @xcite and @xmath19 is the limb - darkened angular diameter ( mas ) .",
    "the model fluxes were taken from the phoenix atmosphere code of @xcite and these are primarily functions of effective temperature ( although we did interpolate in these models for the appropriate gravity and metallicity of each target ) .",
    "we used our values of @xmath19 from table  [ tbl - derived ] to find the estimates of @xmath53 and hence effective temperature that are listed in column  8 of table  [ tbl - derived ] ( under the heading @xmath24(2mass ) ) .",
    "the temperatures agree well with those from the bolometric correction method , @xmath24(bc ) , discussed above .",
    "note that the adopted limb - darkened diameters themselves depend on the assumed temperature through the limb darkening coefficients , but since the resulting temperatures are so similar and the limb darkening is a minor effect , this approximation has a negligible impact on the temperature derived this way .    finally we note that we find no evidence in our data that any target has a close binary companion that could affect the radius estimates .",
    "the targets are all radial velocity constant ( r.m.s .",
    "@xmath54 m  s@xmath40 ) according to the spectroscopic survey of @xcite .",
    "optical speckle interferometry by @xcite and @xcite indicates that gj  687 has a companion at a separation of @xmath55 , which is too wide to influence our observations ( except as a source of incoherent light that might reduce the measured visibility ) .",
    "however , near - infrared speckle observations @xcite and high resolution hst / nicmos imaging ( t.  j.  henry , private communication ) show no evidence of a companion at such a separation .",
    "we examined the mean fringe envelopes for each set of scans of this star and found no detectable companion with @xmath56 in the separation range 12  70 mas .",
    "clearly more observations are required to settle the question about a companion to gj  687 , but we tentatively assume that the measured visibility is dominated by the photospheric disk of the bright m - dwarf .",
    "in an effort to further constrain the poorly populated mass  radius relation for low - mass stars , we started by comparing our results with other low - mass stellar radii directly measured with long - baseline interferometers @xcite .",
    "all masses were derived from the same @xmath37-band mass  luminosity relation of @xcite , and we adopted a 10% error to account for photometric and empirical fitting errors .",
    "note that the mass derived from the absolute @xmath37 magnitude should have little or no dependence upon the stellar metallicity ( see fig .",
    "3b of @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also measured the angular diameter of gj 15a and their value of @xmath57 mas agrees with our value @xmath58 mas .",
    "however , we adopted a less severe limb - darkening correction resulting in a smaller linear diameter . in our mass  radius plot ( figure  [ fig - mass_radius ] ) , we only show our data point for gj 15a . eclipsing binary star measurements",
    "are also shown in figure  [ fig - mass_radius ] as open circles , and it should be noted that some of the errors bars are smaller than the symbol size .",
    "the theoretical models of @xcite for [ m / h ] @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are shown as the lines .",
    "additionally , the models of @xcite for [ m / h ] @xmath59 , @xmath62 ( assuming z@xmath63 ) are plotted to show the range of model uncertainty . according to these models",
    ", metallicity should have little effect on radius for a given mass star .",
    "however , there is either a systematic effect in the data or the models are underestimating the sizes of the stars for a given mass .",
    "we doubt the former possibility because this effect is seen in data from multiple instruments and is present in both the interferometric and binary results .",
    "indeed , the larger than expected radii have already been noted in several investigations @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that larger radii could result from pervasive magnetic fields that could alter the interior structure and push the occurrence of completely convective interiors to stars of lower effective temperatures .",
    "they suggest that m - stars with active magnetic fields will have larger radii than predicted by standard models . however , there is no evidence that the m - dwarfs in our sample have any special magnetic properties .",
    "all are slow rotators @xcite , have moderate x - ray coronal emission @xcite , have normal chromospheric h@xmath64 lines @xcite , and show no evidence of photometric variability in _ hipparcos _ photometry @xcite .",
    "thus , these stars do not have the exceptionally strong magnetic fields that would lead to larger radii according to the models of @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", our sample stars do span a significant range in metallicity , and metallicity will play a role in the internal structure of m - stars . to investigate this possibility , we plot in figure  [ fig - met_radius ] the fractional deviation from the [ m / h]=0 model prediction as a function of metallicity .",
    "the metallicities for most stars are taken from @xcite except for those for gj  191 , gj  205 , gj  887 @xcite , and gj 699 @xcite .",
    "efforts to derive accurate metallicities for m dwarfs are in the nascent phase at this time , so the metallicity values should be considered preliminary , although the general trends are likely reliable .",
    "we see that the observed radii are approximately consistent with predictions among the metal - poor stars , but the radii become larger than predicted as the metallicity increases .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn from the results of @xcite who show that the radii derived from spectral fits are systematically larger among stars with higher metallicity when plotted in a @xmath65 diagram ( see their fig .",
    "13 ) . because metallicity is closely related to stellar opacity",
    ", we suspect that the current generation of models for the interiors and atmospheres of m - stars is missing some opacity component that results in larger radii for stars of higher metallicity .",
    "we are planning to expand this investigation to other targets with a wider range in metallicity in order to explore this connection further .",
    "this work will include more spatial coverage via different baselines and observations at shorter wavelengths to obtain measurements farther along the visibility curves .",
    "we would like to thank pj goldfinger , mandy henderson , steve golden , and bob cadman for their tireless efforts at the array .",
