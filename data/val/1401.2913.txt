    "since its first observation in 2003 by the belle collaboration @xcite , the @xmath0 has attracted the interest of all the hadronic community .",
    "it is the most well studied state among the new charmonium states and has been confirmed by five collaborations : cdf @xcite , d0 @xcite , babar @xcite , lhcb @xcite and cms @xcite .",
    "there is little doubt in the community that the @xmath0 structure is more complex than just a @xmath1 state . besides the @xmath0 the other recently observed charmonium states that clearly have a more complex structure than @xmath1 are the charged states . up to",
    "now there are some experimental evidences for seven charged states , which are shown in table 1 .",
    "the first charged charmonium state , the @xmath2 , was observed by the belle collaboration in 2008 , produced in @xmath3 @xcite . however the babar collaboration @xcite searched for the @xmath4 signature in four decay modes and concluded that there is no significant evidence for a signal peak in any of these processes .",
    "very recently the belle collaboration has confirmed the @xmath2 observation and has determined the preferred assignment of the quantum numbers to be @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "curiously , there are no reports of a @xmath6 signal in the @xmath7 decay channel .",
    "the @xmath2 observation motivated further studies of other @xmath8 decays .",
    "the belle collaboration has reported the observation of two resonance - like structures , called @xmath9 and @xmath10 , in the exclusive process @xmath11 , in the @xmath12 mass distribution @xcite .",
    "once again the babar colaboration did not confirm these observations @xcite .",
    "after these non confirmations , it was with great excitement that the hadron community heard about the observation of the @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath13 was first observed by the besiii collaboration in the @xmath14 mass spectrum of the @xmath15 decay channel @xcite .",
    "this structure , was also observed at the same time by the belle collaboration @xcite and was confirmed by the authors of ref .",
    "[ ] using cleo - c data .",
    "soon after the @xmath13 observation , the besiii related the observation of other three charges states : @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite . up to now",
    "it is not clear if the states @xmath13-@xmath18 and the states @xmath16-@xmath17 are the same states seen in different decay channels , or if they are independent states .",
    "all these charged states can not be @xmath1 states and they are natural candidates for molecular or tetraquark states .",
    "these exotic states are allowed by the strong interactions , both at the fundamental level and at the effective level , and their absence in the experimentally measured spectrum has always been a mystery . the theoretical tools to address these questions are lattice qcd , chiral perturbation theory , qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) , effective lagrangian approaches and quark models . for more details",
    "we refer the reader to the more comprehensive ref .",
    "[ ] and to the more recent and also more specific ref .",
    "[ ] review articles .    in this rapidly evolving field ,",
    "periodic accounts of the status of theory and experiment are needed .",
    "there are already several reviews of the recent charmonium spectroscopy .",
    "the present one is focused on the charged states and on the qcdsr approach to them . in the next sections we discuss some of these new charmonium states using the qcdsr approach .",
    "the method of the qcdsr is a powerful tool to evaluate the masses and decay widths of hadrons based on first principles .",
    "it was first introduced by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov @xcite to the study of mesons , and was latter extended to baryons by ioffe @xcite and chung _ et al .",
    "since then the qcdsr technique has been applied to study numerous hadronic properties with various flavor content and has been discussed in many reviews @xcite emphasizing different aspects of the method .",
    "the method is based on identities between two- or three - point correlation functions , which connect hadronic observables with qcd fundamental parameters , such as quark masses , the strong coupling constant , and quantities which characterize the qcd vacuum , i.e. , the condensates .",
    "the correlation function is of a dual nature : it represents a quark - antiquark fluctuation for short distances ( or large momentum ) and can be treated in perturbative qcd , while at large distances ( or small momentum ) it can be related to hadronic observables .",
    "the sum rule calculations are based on the assumption that in some range of momentum both descriptions are equivalent .",
    "one , thus , proceeds by calculating the correlation function for both cases and by eventually equating them to obtain information on the properties of the hadrons .    in principle , qcdsr allow first - principle calculations . in practice , however , in order to extract results , it is necessary to make expansions , truncations , and other approximations that may reduce the power of the formalism and introduce large errors .",
    "however , if one can find ways to control these errors , the method can provide important informations about the structure of the hadrons .",
    "the qcd sum rule calculations of the mass of a hadronic state are based on the correlator of two hadronic currents .",
    "a generic two - point correlation function is given by ( q)id^4 x e^iqx 0| t [ j(x)j^(0)]|0  , [ cor ] where @xmath19 is a current with the quantum numbers of the hadron we want to study . in the qcdsr approach",
    "the correlation function is evaluated in two different ways : at the quark level in terms of quark and gluon fields and at the hadronic level introducing hadron characteristics such as the mass and the coupling of the hadronic state to the current @xmath19 .",
    "the hadronic side , or phenomenological side of the sum rule is evaluated by writing a dispersion relation to the correlator in eq .",
    "( [ cor ] ) : ^phen(q^2)=-ds ( s)q^2-s+i+ , [ disp ] where @xmath20 is the spectral density given by the absorptive part of the correlator and the dots represent subtraction terms .    since the current @xmath21 is an operator that annihilates ( creates ) all hadronic states that have the same quantum numbers as @xmath22 , @xmath23 contains information about all these hadronic states , including the low mass hadron of interest . in order the qcdsr technique to be useful , one must parameterize @xmath24 with a small number of parameters . in general one",
    "parameterizes the spectral density as a single sharp pole representing the lowest resonance of mass @xmath25 , plus a smooth continuum representing higher mass states : ( s)=^2(s - m^2 ) + _ cont(s ) , [ den ] where @xmath26 gives the coupling of the current with the low mass hadron , @xmath27 : @xmath28 . with this ansatz",
    "the phenomenological side of the sum rule becomes : ^phen(q^2)=-^2q^2-m^2- _ s_min^ ds _ cont(s)q^2-s+i+ , [ phen ] in the qcd side , or ope side the correlation function is evaluated by using the wilson s operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite : ^ope(q)=_nc_n(q^2)_n , [ cope ] where the set @xmath29 includes all local gauge invariant operators expressible in terms of the gluon fields and the fields of light quarks , which are represented in the form of vacuum condensates .",
    "the lowest dimension condensates are the quark condensate of dimension three : @xmath30 , and the gluon condensate of dimension four : @xmath31 .",
    "the lowest - dimension operator with @xmath32 is the unit operator associated with the perturbative contribution .    for non exotic mesons , _",
    "i.e. _ normal quark - antiquark states , such as @xmath20 and @xmath33 , the contributions of condensates with dimension higher than four are suppressed by large powers of @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ cope ] ) can be safely truncated after dimension four condensates , even at intermediate values of @xmath35 . however , for molecular or tetraquark states , higher dimension condensates like the dimension five mixed - condensate : @xmath36 , the dimension six four - quark condensate : @xmath37 and even the dimension eight quark condensate times the mixed - condensate : @xmath38 , can play an important role .",
    "the three - gluon condensate of dimension - six : @xmath39 can be safely neglected , since it is suppressed by the loop factor @xmath40 .    the precise evaluation of the @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , condensates require a involved analysis including a non - trivial choice of factorization scheme @xcite .",
    "therefore , in our calculations we assume that their vacuum saturation values are given by :     the ope side can also be written in terms of a dispersion relation as : ^ope(q^2)=-_s_min^ ds ^ope(s)q^2-s+i + , [ ope ] where ^ope(s)=1im[^ope(s ) ] . to keep the number of parameters as small as possible , in general in the qcdsr approach one assumes that the continuum contribution to the spectral density , @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ phen ] ) , vanishes bellow a certain continuum threshold @xmath46 . above this threshold one uses the ansatz _ cont(s)=^ope(s)(s - s_0 ) .",

    "( [ phen ] ) we get ^phen(q^2)=-^2q^2-m^2- _ s_0^ ds ^ope(s)q^2-s+i+ , [ phen2 ]    to improve the matching of the two descriptions of the correlator one applies the borel transformation .",
    "the borel transformation removes the subtraction terms in the dispersion relation , and exponentially suppresses the contribution from excited resonances and continuum states in the phenomenological side . in the ope side",
    "the borel transformation suppresses the contribution from higher dimension condensates by a factorial term .    after performing a borel transform on both sides of the sum rule , and transferring the continuum contribution to the ope side",
    ", the sum rule can be written as ^2e^-m^2/m^2=_s_min^s_0ds",
    "e^-s / m^2  ^ope(s )",
    ". [ sr ]    a good sum rule is obtained in the case that one can find a range of @xmath47 , called borel window , in which the two sides have a good overlap and information on the lowest resonance can be extracted . to determine the allowed borel window , one analyses the ope convergence and the pole contribution : the minimum value of the borel mass is fixed by considering the convergence of the ope , and the maximum value of the borel mass",
    "is determined by imposing the condition that the pole contribution must be bigger than the continuum contribution .",
    "the mass of the hadronic state , @xmath25 , can be obtained by taking the derivative of eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) with respect to @xmath48 , and dividing the result by eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) : m^2=_s_min^s_0ds  e^-s / m^2  s  ^ope(s)_s_min^ s_0ds  e^-s / m^2  ^ope(s ) . [ m2 ]    using the formalism described above we can compute the masses of the new states .",
    "a compilation of results of the states discussed here is shown in table 2 .",
    "these numbers will be discussed in detail in the next sections .",
    "the qcd sum rule calculations for the coupling constant in a hadronic vertex are based on the correlator of three hadronic currents .",
    "a generic three - point correlation function associated with a vertex of three mesons @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 is given by ( p,,q ) = d^4x d^4y e^ix e^-iqy 0|t\\{j_3(x ) j_2^(y ) j_1^(0)}|0 [ corr ] where @xmath52 and the current @xmath53 represents states with the quantum numbers of the meson @xmath54 . as in the case of the two - point correlation function , the function in eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) is evaluated in two ways . in the ope side",
    "we consider that the currents are composed by quarks and we use the wilson s ope to evaluate the correlation function . in the phenomenological side , we insert , in eq.([corr ] ) , intermediate states for the mesons @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we then write the correlation function in terms of the coupling of these mesons with the corresponding currents , and in terms of the form factor , @xmath55 , in the hadronic vertex , which is defined by the generalization of the on - mass - shell matrix element , @xmath56 , for an off - shell @xmath50 meson : m_3 ( ) m_2(q)|m_1(p)=g_m_1m_2m_3(q^2)f_m_1,p f_m_2 , f_m_3,q , [ coup ] which can be extracted from the effective lagrangian that describes the coupling between these three mesons . in eq .",
    "( [ coup ] ) the functions @xmath57 are obained from the lagrangian and are related with the quantum numbers of the meson @xmath58 . after evaluating both sides separately ,",
    "we equate one description with the other and we can extract the form factor from the sum rule .    the coupling constant is defined as the value of the form factor at the meson pole : @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the mass of the meson @xmath50 that was off - shell . very often , in order to determine the coupling constant we have to extrapolate the qcdsr results to a @xmath61 region where the sum rules are no longer valid ( since the qcdsr results are valid in the deep euclidian region ) .",
    "to do that , in general , we parametrize the qcdsr results through a analytical form , like a monopole or an exponential function . for more details",
    "we refer the reader to ref .  [ ] .",
    "the @xmath0 was first observed by belle collaboration in 2003 in the decay @xmath62 @xcite , and has been confirmed by other five collaborations @xcite .",
    "the current world average mass is @xmath63 mev and its total width is less than @xmath64 mev @xcite .",
    "the lhcb collaboration determined @xmath65 quantum numbers with more than 8@xmath66 significance @xcite .",
    "calculations using constituent quark models give masses for possible charmonium states , with @xmath67 quantum numbers , which are much bigger than the observed @xmath0 mass : @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xcite . these results , together with the coincidence between the @xmath70 mass and the @xmath71 threshold : @xmath72 @xcite , inspired the proposal that the @xmath0 could be a molecular @xmath73 bound state with small binding energy @xcite .",
    "other interesting possible interpretation of the @xmath0 , first proposed by maiani _",
    "@xcite , is that it could be a tetraquark state resulting from the binding of a diquark and an antidiquark .",
    "the fisrt qcdsr calculation of the mass of the @xmath0 considered as a @xmath67 tetraquark state was done in ref .",
    "following this calculation , a @xmath67 , @xmath74 molecular current was considered in ref .",
    "the corresponding interpolating currents used in these calculations are : j^di_&=&i_abc_dec[(q_a^tc _ 5c_b)(|q_d_c|c_e^t ) + ( q_a^tc_c_b ) ( |q_d_5c|c_e^t ) ] , [ cur - di ] for a tetraquark current , and j^mol _ = 1 , for a molecular @xmath75 current . in eqs .",
    "( [ cur - di ] ) and ( [ cur - mol ] ) , @xmath76 denotes a @xmath77 or @xmath78 quark .    in the ope side ,",
    "the calculations were done at leading order in @xmath79 and contributions of condensates up to dimension eight were included . in both cases it was possible to find a borel window where the pole contribution is bigger than the continuum contribution and with a reasonable ope convergence .    the mass obtained in ref .",
    "[ ] , considering the allowed borel window and the uncertaities in the parameters , was @xmath80 gev whereas the result for the mass obtained in ref .",

    "we see that , in both cases , a good agreement with the experimental mass was obtained . up to",
    "now there are many qcdsr calculations@xcite of the the mass of the @xmath0 considering different currents and in all cases good agreement with the experimental mass is found .",
    "even with a mixed charmonium - molecular current the value obtained for the mass does not change significantly @xcite .",
    "these calculations only confirm the result presented in ref .",
    "[ ] that shows that the calculation of the mass of a given state , in the qcdsr approach , is very insensitive to the choice of the current .",
    "however , this may not be the case for the decay width@xcite .",
    "the first qcdsr calculation of the width of the @xmath0 was done in ref .",
    "[ ] . in particular , in ref .",
    "[ ] the @xmath0 was considered as a tetraquark state described by the current in eq .",

    "a similar width was obtained in ref .",
    "[ ] with a molecular current such as the one in eq .",
    "( [ cur - mol ] ) .",
    "indeed , large partial decay widths are expected when the coupling constant is obtained from qcdsr , in the case of multiquark states , when the initial state contains the same number of valence quarks as the number of valence quarks in the final state .",
    "an example is the case of the light scalars @xmath66 and @xmath83 studied in ref .",
    "[ ] , which widths are of the order of 400 mev . in the case of the @xmath84 decay ,",
    "the generic decay diagram in terms of quarks has two `` petals '' , one associated with the @xmath33 and the other with the @xmath20 .    among the possible diagrams , there are two distinct subsets",
    ". diagrams with no gluon exchange between the petals , as the one shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , and therefore , no color exchange between the two final mesons in the decay .",
    "if there is no color exchange , the final state containing two color singlets was already present in the initial state . in this case",
    "the tetraquark had a component similar to a @xmath85 molecule .",
    "the other subset of diagrams is the one where there is a gluon exchange between the petals , as the one shown in fig .",
    "this type of diagram represents the case where the @xmath70 is a genuine four - quark state with a complicated color structure .",
    "these diagrams are called color - conected ( cc ) . considering only the cc diagrams in the calculation ,",
    "the decay width obtained in ref .",
    "[ ] was : _",
    "cc(xj/  j^+^-)=(0.70.2 )  , [ widthcc ] in a very good agreement with the experimental upper limit .    this procedure may appear somewhat unjustified .",
    "however , if the initial state has a non - trivial color structure only cc diagrams should contribute to the calculation . unfortunately , although the initial tetraquark current has a non - trivial color structure , it can be rewritten as a sum of molecular type currents with trivial color configuration through a fierz transformation .",
    "this is the reason why the diagrams without gluon exchange between the two `` petals '' survive in the qcdsr calculation .",
    "therefore , the approach of considering only cc diagrams can be considered as a form of simulating a real tetraquark state with non - trivial color structure .    other possible approach to reduce",
    "the large widht is to consider the @xmath0 as a mixture between a @xmath1 current and a molecular current , as done in ref .",
    "[ ] : j_(x)= ( ) j^mol_(x ) + ( ) j^2_(x ) , with @xmath86 given in eq .",
    "( [ cur - mol ] ) and j^2_(x ) = 1 6 .",
    "the necessity of mixing a @xmath1 component with the @xmath87 molecule was already pointed out in some works @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "[ ] , a simulation of the production of a bound @xmath87 state with binding energy as small as 0.25 mev , obtained a cross section of about two orders of magnitude smaller than the prompt production cross section of the @xmath0 observed by the cdf collaboration .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "[ ] concluded that @xmath88-wave resonant scattering is unlikely to allow the formation of a loosely bound @xmath87 molecule in high energy hadron collision .",
    "as discussed above , there is no problem in reproducing the experimental mass of the @xmath0 , using the current in eq .",
    "( [ cur24 ] ) , for a wide range of the mixture angle @xmath89 .",
    "however , the value of the @xmath90 coupling constant and , therefore , the value of the @xmath91 decay width , is strongly dependent on this angle .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] that for a mixing angle @xmath92 , it is possible to describe the experimental mass of the @xmath0 with a decay width @xmath93 , which is compatible with the experimental upper limit .",
    "therefore , in a qcdsr calculation , the @xmath0 can be well described basically by a @xmath1 current with a small , but fundamental , admixture of molecular ( @xmath75 ) or tetraquark ( @xmath94[\\bar{c}\\bar{q}]$ ] ) currents .",
    "this resonance was found by belle collaboration in the channel @xmath95 and it was the first charged charmonium state observed , with mass @xmath96 mev and width @xmath97 mev @xcite .",
    "curiously , there is no signal of this resonance in the @xmath98 channel .",
    "since the minimal quark content of this state is @xmath99 this can only be achieved in a multiquark configuration .",
    "the babar collaboration searched the @xmath100 in the four decay modes @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "no significant evidence of a signal peak was found in any of the processes investigated @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath2 mass is close to the @xmath105 threshold , it was suggested that it could be an s - wave threshold effect or a @xmath105 molecular state .",
    "considering the @xmath2 as a weakly bound @xmath88-wave @xmath106 molecular state , its quantum numbers may be @xmath107 .",
    "the @xmath108 assignment is probably suppressed in the @xmath109 decay beacuse of the small phase space .",
    "other possible interpretations are a tetraquark state , a cusp in the @xmath105 channel , a baryonium state , a radially excited @xmath110 state and a hadrocharmonium state @xcite .",
    "there are qcdsr calculations for the @xmath2 assuming that the state could have @xmath111 or @xmath112 quantum numbers @xcite . in the first case",
    "the obtained masses were @xmath113 gev for a @xmath105 molecular current @xcite and @xmath114 gev for a diquark - antidiquark current @xcite .",
    "in the second assignment and for a diquark - antidiquark current the obtained mass was @xmath115 gev @xcite .",
    "these numbers are displayed in table 2 .    from these results the preliminary conclusion , at the time , was that the assignment @xmath112 was disfavored and that the configuration @xmath111 , in both molecular and tetraquark states , would lead to a mass which is in agreement with the data .",
    "however , a recent reanalysis of the belle data revealed that the favored quantum numbers are @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that soon after the @xmath2 was first observed , maiani _",

    "the existence of a charged partner of the @xmath0 was first proposed in ref .",
    "[ ] .    clearly , in view of the recent experimental reanalysis , if the @xmath2 really exist , it could be a @xmath117 resonance or a tetraquark excitation , which invalidates a qcdsr calculation .",

    "two resonance - like structures , called @xmath9 and @xmath10 , were observed by the belle collaboration in the exclusive process @xmath11 , in the @xmath121 mass distribution @xcite .",
    "the significance of each of the @xmath122 structures exceeds 5 @xmath66 and , since they were observed in the @xmath122 channel , they must have the quantum numbers @xmath123 .",

    "following the same trend , the mass of the @xmath148 molecule will be far from the @xmath9 mass .",

    "[ ] it was shown that , in order to reproduce the measured width , the effective radius must be @xmath168 fm .",
    "this size scale is small and pushes the molecular picture to its limit of validity . in another work@xcite ,",
    "the new state was treated as a charged @xmath166 molecule and the authors explored its electromagnetic structure , arriving at the conclusion that its charge radius is of the order of @xmath169 @xmath170 . taking this radius as a measure of the spatial size of the state , we conclude that it is more compact than a @xmath33 , for which @xmath171 @xmath170 . in ref .",
    "[ ] the combined results of refs .  [ ] and [ ] were taken as an indication that the @xmath159 is a compact object , which may be better understood as a quark cluster , such as a tetraquark . moreover ,",
    "the @xmath157 was interpreted as the isospin 1 partner of the @xmath172 , as the charged state predicted in ref .",
    "[ ] . therefore , the quantum numbers for the neutral state in the isospin multiplet were assumed to be @xmath173 .",
    "the interpolating field for @xmath13 used in ref .",
    "[ ] is given by eq .",
    "( [ cur - di ] ) with the plus signal changed by a minus signal .",
    "the three - point qcdsr were used to evaluate the coupling constants in the vertices @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 . in all cases only color - connected diagrams",
    "were considered , since the @xmath157 is expected to be a genuine tetraquark state with a non - trivial color structure .",
    "the obtained couplings , with the respective decay widths , are given in table 3 .",
    "a total width of @xmath178 mev was found for the @xmath157 , in good agreement with the two experimental values : @xmath179 mev from besiii @xcite , and @xmath180 mev from belle @xcite .    from the results in table 3 it is possible to evaluate the ratio @xmath181    the qcdsr analysis performed in ref .",
    "[ ] also supports the identification of @xmath0 and @xmath13 as the @xmath65 and @xmath182 diquark - antidiquark type tetraquark states , respectively .",
    "very recently the besiii collaboration reported the observation of other three charges states : @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite .    in the besiii set - up a reaction @xmath186",
    "was performed at @xmath187 gev and a peak was seen in the @xmath188 invariant mass distribution just about @xmath189 mev above the threshold .",
    "the peak was identified as a new particle , the @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the authors assume in the paper that the @xmath190 pair is created in a s - wave and then the @xmath16 must have @xmath116 to match , together with the pion , the quantum numbers @xmath112 of the virtual photon from the @xmath191 pair .",
    "however , they also state that the experiment does not exclude other spin - parity assignments .",
    "since the @xmath192 has charge , the isospin must be i = 1 .    in parallel with the experimental works many theoretical papers were devoted to understand these new states . in ref .",
    "[ ] , heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) was used to make predictions for states containing one @xmath144 or @xmath140 and one @xmath193 or @xmath194 . assuming the @xmath0 to be @xmath195 molecule , the authors found a series of new hadronic molecules , including the @xmath13 and the @xmath16 .",
    "they would correspond to bound states ( with uncertainties of about @xmath196 mev in the binding ) of @xmath197 and @xmath198 respectively , with quantum numbers @xmath199 .",
    "remarkably , even with uncertainties , these states always appear in the bound region . in refs .",
    "[ ] , using qcd sum rules and assuming a structure of @xmath130 , the authors obtained a possible @xmath200 state compatible with the @xmath16 albeit with around @xmath201 mev uncertainty in the energy . recently",
    "@xcite , a study of the @xmath130 system has also been done within qcd sum rules , projecting the correlation function on spin - parity @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 . in the three cases a state with mass @xmath205 mev",
    "was found .",
    "the central value of the mass of these states is more in line with the results of refs .",
    "[ ] , although with the error bar , they could as well be related to a resonance . in ref .",
    "[ ] the new @xmath159 states were investigated from a different perspective and , using pion exchange , a @xmath130 state with @xmath200 compatible with the @xmath206 was obtained .",
    "one should note that the input used in this latter work is quite different from the one in ref .",
    "[ ] since in hqss the pion exchange is subdominant . finally , in ref .",
    "[ ] , using a tetraquark structure and qcdsr , a state with @xmath207 compatible with @xmath206 was obtained , once again with a large error in the energy of @xmath208 mev . in a different analysis , in ref .",
    "[ ] a pion and the @xmath130 state are produced from the @xmath209 and the @xmath130 state is left to interact , while the pion remains a spectator ( initial single - pion emission mechanism ) .",
    "although it is not mentioned whether the @xmath130 interaction produces a resonance with certain quantum numbers , the authors show that the mechanism can produce some enhancement in the @xmath130 invariant mass distribution just above threshold",
    ".    bumps close to the threshold of a pair of particles should be treated with caution .",
    "sometimes they are identified as new particles , but they can also be a reflection of a resonance below threshold . in a similar reaction , @xmath210 , the belle collaboration reported @xcite a bump close to the threshold in the @xmath211 invariant mass distribution , which was tentatively interpreted as a new resonance .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "[ ] it was shown that the bump was better interpreted in terms of a @xmath211 molecular state , below the @xmath211 threshold ( the so called @xmath212 ) .",
    "similarly , in ref .  [ ] the @xmath213 threshold peak measured @xcite in the @xmath214 reaction was better interpreted as a signal of the @xmath215 resonance , below the @xmath216 threshold , which couples strongly to @xmath217 .",
    "further examples of this phenomenon may be found in ref .",
    "[ ] . in that work the theory of @xmath218 interactions is reviewed and it is pointed out that a @xmath219 state with a mass above the threshold is very difficult to support . in particular , in ref .  [ ]",
    "it was found that there is only one bound state of @xmath219 in @xmath220 , with quantum numbers @xmath221 with a mass around @xmath222 mev and a width of about @xmath223 mev .",
    "both mass and width are compatible with the reanalysis of data carried out in ref .",
    "[ ] . therefore , we can conclude that such @xmath224 @xmath134 bound state provides a natural explanation for the state observed in @xcite .",
    "an argument against the existence of a new resonance above the threshold is the fact that if the state were a @xmath116 produced in s - wave , as assumed in the experimental work , it would easily decay into @xmath225 exchanging a @xmath144 meson in the t - channel .",
    "this is also the decay channel of the @xmath157 , which would then have the same quantum numbers as the state claimed in ref .",
    "[ ] . however , while a peak is clearly seen in the @xmath225 invariant mass distribution in the case of the @xmath157 , no trace of a peak is seen around @xmath226 mev in spite of using the same reaction and the same @xmath227 energy .",
    "less than a month after the observation of the @xmath16 , the besiii collaboration reported the observation of the @xmath17 , a structure observed in the @xmath228 mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "the difference between the parameters of this structure and the @xmath16 , observed in the @xmath218 final state , is within @xmath229 and it is not clear whether they are the same state or not .",
    "the authors do not find a significant signal for @xmath230 .",
    "since the @xmath16 and the @xmath17 have almost the same mass and their quantum numbers were not yet accurately determined , we might think that they are , in fact , the same particle . looking only at the most natural quantum numbers of the final states , the s - wave @xmath130 states have the quantum numbers @xmath231 , @xmath232 and @xmath233 , while the s - wave @xmath234 states have the quantum numbers @xmath235 . therefore the @xmath16 and @xmath17 would be different particles . however , it is also possible to have a p - wave @xmath228 system with quantum numbers @xmath231 @xmath232 and @xmath233 . in this case",
    "the @xmath16 and the @xmath17 could be the same particle .    in the analysis presented in ref .",
    "[ ] , the author concluded that qcdsr do not support the picture of @xmath16 and @xmath17 as diquark - antidiquark vector tetraquark states with @xmath236 .",
    "a short time later , in ref .",
    "[ ] the author concluded that , for these two states ( treated as a single state ) , the qcdsr analysis supports the assignements @xmath237 and @xmath224 in a diquark - antidiquark configuration .    shortly after the observation of the @xmath17 the same collaboration reported the measurement of the @xmath18 , a charged structure observed in the @xmath238 invariant mass distribution @xcite .",
    "the mass and width of this structure are @xmath239 and @xmath240 , respectively , below those of the @xmath13 .",
    "the angular distribution of the @xmath241 system favors the @xmath237 assignment and disfavors @xmath242 or @xmath243 .",
    "regarding the fact that this state could be the @xmath157 , saw in a different decay channel , the only comment from the experimental side is that if the @xmath13 and @xmath18 are the same state , then the ratio @xmath244 is determined @xcite .    comparing the results in eqs .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) and ( [ bes ] ) we can conclude that , if the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ bes ] ) is confirmed , the states @xmath13 and @xmath18 are not the same state .    here again , as in the case of the @xmath16 discussed above , it is possible that the @xmath18 ) is not a real state but a manifestation of a resonance with a mass below the @xmath245 threshold .",
    "this point remains to be clarified .",
    "the proliferation of new charmonium states motivates attempts to group them into families .",
    "one possible way to organize some of the charmonium and bottomonium new states was suggested in ref .  [ ] and it is summarized in fig .",
    "2 . in this figure",
    "we present the charm and bottom spectra in the mass region of interest . on the left ( right )",
    "we show the charm ( bottom ) states with their mass differences in mev .",
    "the comparison between the two left lines with the two lines on the right emphasizes the similarity between the spectra . in the bottom of the second column",
    "we have the newly found @xmath13 .",
    "the existence of a charged partner of the @xmath0 was first proposed in ref .",
    "a few years later@xcite the same group proposed that the @xmath2 , observed by belle@xcite , would be the first radial excitation of the charged partner of the @xmath0 .",
    "this suggestion was supported by the fact that the mass difference corresponding to a radial excitation in the charmonium sector is given by @xmath246 mev .",
    "this number is close to the mass difference @xmath247 mev .",
    "a similar connection between @xmath248 and @xmath13 was found in the hadro - charmonium approach@xcite , where the former is essentially a @xmath249 embedded in light mesonic matter and the latter a @xmath33 also embedded in light mesonic matter . in ref .",
    "[ ] this reasoning was extended to the bottom sector and it was conjectured that the @xmath250 , observed by the belle collaboration in ref .",
    "[ ] , might be a radial excitation of an yet unmeasured @xmath251 , predicted in ref .",
    "the observation of @xmath252 gives support to this conjecture and should motivate new experimental searches of this bottom charged state and its neutral partner , the only missing states in the diagram .",
    "the most important message from the experimental program carried out at belle and besiii is that definitely there is something really new happening in the charmonium spectroscopy .",
    "this started in 2003 with the measurement of the @xmath0 , which has a very robust experimental signature and has been neasured by many different groups .",
    "the @xmath0 is electrically neutral and hence its multiquark nature was not clear from the beginning .",
    "five years later , in 2008 , the observation of @xmath2 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 would have been the proof of the existence of multiquark configurations in the charmonium sector .",
    "however the non - confirmation of these measurements rendered this claim weak .",
    "another five years later , in 2013 , the confirmation of the observation of the @xmath2 together with the measurements of the @xmath253 ( which was measured by besiii and confirmed by other groups ) and also of the @xmath16 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 , reinforced our belief that we are observing multiquark states .",
    "what has to be done next ? from the experimental side it is necessary to determine unambiguosly the quantum numbers of all these states and eliminate the suspicion that they are mere threshold effects and not real particles .",
    "as suggested in ref .",
    "[ ] , this can be done performing an energy scan in the @xmath191 reactions .",
    "moreover , a more refined analysis will allow us to determine whether all these states are really different .",
    "from the theoretical side its necessary to focus on the calculation of the decay widths in all the different approaches , since , as we have discussed , the masses are easily obtained by different methods and they are not sufficient to discriminate between different theoretial models .",
    "if our present picture of these states survives all these tests and improvements , we will have found multiquark states .",
    "this is in itself very interesting ! whether meson molecules , tetraquarks or hadrocharmonium , these are novel objects which will induce a small revolution in our understanding of hadrons .",
