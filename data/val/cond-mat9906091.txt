    "there is growing experimental evidence of anisotropic forms of superconductivity in the quasi two - dimensional perovskite oxides .",

    "p - wave spin - triplet pairing provides a better understanding of the experimental data in the ruthanate @xmath0 that appears to be close to ordering ferromagnetically and becomes superconducting only at low temperature ( of the order of @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "numerous mechanisms have been proposed for anisotropic superconductivity , especially in the cuprates .",
    "one of the most extensively investigated theoretically is based on a magnetic interaction arising via the exchange of enhanced antiferromagnetic spin - fluctuations @xcite .",
    "though not entirely without difficulties , this mechanism correctly anticipated from the beginning the d - wave symmetry of the order parameter observed in some of the copper oxides .",
    "moreover , when treated in the mean - field eliashberg theory with full momentum dependence of the electron self - energy , it provided an account of the high transition temperatures in the cuprates , in terms of parameters determined independently from normal state properties alone .    in this paper",
    "we include the case where , in contrast to the cuprates , a magnetic interaction between electron quasiparticles arises from the exchange of ferromagnetic instead of antiferromagnetic spin - fluctuations in quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) compounds .",
    "our calculations differ from those previously reported@xcite for p - wave triplet pairing in the following ways : ( i ) they concern quasi 2d rather than 3d systems , ( ii ) employ a non - parabolic band structure which has potential relevance to real compounds , and ( iii ) make use of the full green s function in place of a simple pole approximation for the propagator .",
    "the latter ( iii ) takes a better account of the momentum dependence of the electron self - energy and was found to be important in the nearly antiferromagnetic 2d systems@xcite .",
    "comparisons of the mean - field eliashberg equations for nearly ferromagnetic and nearly antiferromagnetic metals with a single 2d fermi surface are presented for a range of parameters defining the magnetic interaction in potentially realistic cases .",
    "the results show that the incipient ferromagnets are expected to have p - wave ( spin - triplet ) pairing and transition temperatures that are much lower than in the nearly antiferromagnetic metals for otherwise similar conditions .",
    "a physical interpretation of the numerical analyses is given together with a discussion of the possible relevance of the magnetic interaction model for @xmath0 .",
    "the mean - field analysis is intended as a first step toward a more complete treatment of superconductivity in highly correlated electron systems .",
    "it may also serve as a possible guide to future experiments to test for the existence of magnetically mediated superconductivity in general .    the outline of the paper goes as follows .",

    "our model assumes that the coupling parameter g is constant .",
    "the @xmath18 dependence in the simplest case arises from the atomic form factor . for tight binding bands",
    "the latter is local in space and this leads to a weak dependence of g on @xmath18 .",

    "one also observes from figs.(3a ) and ( 5a ) that @xmath17 saturates much more rapidly to its largest value as @xmath73 is increased in the antiferromagnetic case than it does for ferromagnetic spin - fluctuations .",
    "one sees from figs.(3b ) and ( 5b ) that the transition temperature is much less sensitive to changes in @xmath65 in the d - wave case than it is for p - wave superconductivity . as the inverse correlation length @xmath65",
    "is reduced , the mean - field @xmath17 is much more robust for antiferromagnetic spin - fluctuations than for their ferromagnetic counterparts , indicating that pair - breaking effects are not as damaging in the former case . the eliashberg renormalization factor @xmath74 is shown in figs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) versus wavevector @xmath75 for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin - fluctuations for @xmath76 .",
    "the average of @xmath74 over the fermi surface as a function of @xmath65 is shown in fig.(8 ) for the ferromagnetic case for several values of the coupling parameter @xmath55 .",
    "we point out that even in the ferromagnetic case , @xmath77 is strongly anisotropic around the fermi surface when the coupling parameter is small ( fig.(6a ) ) and becomes more isotropic in the strong coupling limit ( fig.(7a ) ) .",
    "the anisotropy for small coupling parameter can be understood as a density of states effect , since the smaller fermi velocity near the @xmath78 point can account for a larger value of @xmath77 in this region of the brillouin zone .",
    "these effects should matter less in the strong couping limit . on the other hand , for antiferromagnetic spin - fluctuations",
    ", the anisotropy of @xmath77 increases as the coupling parameter is increased ( see figs.(6b ) and ( 7b ) ) .",
    "finally , as shown in fig.(8 ) for nearly ferromagnetic systems , @xmath77 increases rapidly and tends to diverge as the inverse correlation length @xmath79 .",
    "the magnetic interaction potential , eqs .",
    "( [ chiml , gap ] ) is attractive everywhere for the ferromagnetic case , but oscillates in space from attractive ( odd sites ) to repulsive ( even sites ) in nearly antiferromagnetic metals . since the average potential in the latter case tends to cancel , it may seem surprising at first sight that pairing is so much more effective in nearly antiferromagnetic than ferromagnetic metals .",
    "part of the explanation lies in the fact that the inner product of the spins of two interacting quasiparticles , @xmath80 that enters the pairing potential , is on average three times larger in magnitude for the spin singlet than the spin triplet state for spin @xmath81 particles ( classically the expectation value would of course be the same in both cases ) .",
    "thus the ferromagnetic interaction potential , though everywhere attractive , is for this reason alone , three times weaker than the antiferromagnetic potential .",
    "one can make this argument more quantitative and solve the eliashberg equations for the nearly ferromagnetic metal assuming only the longitudinal spin - fluctuation mode contributes to the self - energy , setting the coupling parameter @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) ( the ising case ) .",
    "the results of the calculations for a spin - fluctuation temperature @xmath28 equal to two thirds of the nearest neighbor hopping energy @xmath83 are shown in fig.(9 ) and to be compared with the results shown in figs.(3 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "while the critical temperatures of the nearly ferromagnetic ising metal are much higher than those of the the nearly ferromagnetic one for similar conditions , they do not quite match those of the nearly antiferromagnetic case .",
    "therefore , the factor of three in the pairing potential is not the whole story .",
    "the extra factor of @xmath84 from landau damping in eq .",
    "( [ ferro ] ) leads to greater incoherent scattering for a nearly ferromagnetic than antiferromagnetic metal , and hence to a reduced @xmath17 .",
    "we have also solved the eliashberg equations for the nearly ferromagnetic ising metal without landau damping ( with @xmath85 , in eq .",
    "( [ ferro ] ) ) .",
    "the results for the same value of @xmath28 are shown in fig.(10 ) .",
    "one might have expected that the ising case without the landau damping would lead to transition temperatures for the purely attractive potential and p - wave pairing that are much higher than from the spatially oscillatory potential and d - wave pairing . that this is not the case , as may be seen by comparing figs.(5 ) and ( 10 ) ,",
    "can be understood when one takes into account of the effects of retardation that restricts scattering to states within a narrow range of wavevectors near the fermi surface .",
    "this implies that the pair wavefunction tends to oscillate in space with wavevector of the order of @xmath86 and the probability distribution with wavevector @xmath87 , i.e with a wavevector comparable to that of the magnetic interaction potential itself .",
    "furthermore , the maxima of the probability appear near the minima of the potential along the square axes , while in the d - wave state , the probability vanishes alltogether along the diagonals where the interaction is everywhere repulsive . in this case",
    "the effect of the repulsive regions is small and the gain achieved with a purely attractive potential with otherwise similar properties is not as great as might have naively been suspected .    beside this",
    "there remains at least one more significant difference between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases that may be relevant to pair formation but is not readily quantified . in the latter case",
    "the mass renormalization is much more anisotropic than in the former and is strongest at points on the fermi surface ( the hot spots ) connected by the antiferromagnetic wavevector .",
    "this anisotropy may lead to strong coupling effects which on the whole are less damaging to pairing than in the corresponding ferromagnetic case where essentially all the points of the fermi surface are equivalent .",
    "taken together , these effects confer a very considerable advantage for pairing to the nearly antiferromagnetic versus ferromagnetic metals that have otherwise comparable properties .",
    "further considerations also lead to an advantage of quasi 2d over 3d metals .",
    "the average of the spin - fluctuation frequency in the brillouin zone tends to be larger in 2d than in 3d .",
    "this favors enhanced incoherent scattering , and hence reduced @xmath17 .",
    "however , it also leads to an enhanced pairing energy and greater robustness against impurities and the effects of competing channels of interactions .",
    "we expect that these latter considerations will normally tend to dominate and hence favor quasi 2d over 3d systems , under otherwise similar conditions , and provided that corrections to the mean - field solutions are not important .    within the magnetic interaction model in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "thus , the highest @xmath17 is expected to arise in quasi 2d metals with high @xmath28 and on the border of a continuous antiferromagnetic transition ( when the magnetic correlation wavevector @xmath79 as @xmath88 ) .",
    "interestingly these conditions are well satisfied in the copper oxides but much less so in the heavy fermion and organic compounds ( see e.g. refs  @xcite and  @xcite respectively ) . in the heavy fermions",
    "@xmath28 happens to be low because the f electrons produce narrow bands , while in the organics @xmath28 is small because the carrier concentration is low .",
    "thus one expects , and indeed one finds , much lower @xmath17 s in these materials than in the cuprates .",
    "the calculations also predict that magnetically mediated superconductivity should be a general phenomenon occuring on the boundary of a continuous magnetic transition , in both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets and in quasi 2d and 3d compounds .",
    "this may not be observed in practice , however , due to pair breaking effects of impurities and other interaction channels not considered here explicitly . in cases when the magnetic transistion is not abrupt and @xmath21 can be made arbitrarily small at low temperatures , the magnetic interaction potential may overwhelm these other effects and , at least in the nearly antiferromagnetic case where the mean - field @xmath17 appears to remain finite as @xmath79 , superconductivity may survive in a narrow range of lattice densities near the critical density where the magnetic order is continuously quenched .",
    "the magnetic interaction model and the mean - field approximation for @xmath17 might be expected to apply most successfully in nearly magnetic metals where @xmath17 is small compared to the electronic bandwidth and @xmath28 .",
    "the nearly ferromagnetic quasi 2d metal @xmath0 that orders in a spin - triplet p - wave state only at very low temperatures ( below @xmath89 ) , @xcite would therefore seem an ideal candidate for comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "the calculations presented in this paper provide a first step toward such a comparison .",
    "the next will be to build a realistic model of @xmath19 from nmr and neutron scattering measurements , or from the numerical calculations now in progress@xcite .",
    "preliminary evidence suggests that @xmath0 may be close both to ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism@xcite .",
    "the competition between these two tendencies , along with the comparatively small magnitude of @xmath90 in the observed spin - triplet state and other features as discussed above , may help to account for the much lower @xmath17 in this layer perovskite oxide compared with that of the cuprates .",
    "we note that our calculations may be expected to break down when the mass renormalization becomes large at high values of the coupling constant or at small @xmath21 near the critical point for magnetic order .",
    "also it should fail when the superconducting coherence length becomes small compared with the average spacing between cooper pairs , i.e. for sufficiently high @xmath17 or in _ strictly _ 2d where there is no true long - range order at finite temperature .",
    "the latter condition is not readily reached in many of the known quasi 2d systems .",
    "finally , we emphasize that our model for the magnetic interaction does not include any possible spin - gap formation .",
    "for this reason alone , it is not expected to apply near the metal - insulator phase boundary in the cuprates@xcite .",
    "we have contrasted the predictions for the superconducting transition temperature for magnetically mediated superconductivity for nearly ferromagnetic versus nearly antiferromagnetic metals in quasi 2d .",
    "the calculations are based on a single fermi surface sheet , and a conventional form for the magnetic interaction arising from the exchange of spin fluctuations treated in the mean - field eliashberg theory .",
    "the dominant @xmath18 and @xmath91 dependence of this interaction is assumed to arise from the dynamical wavevector dependence of the susceptibility , and thus the interaction vertex is taken to be a phenomenological constant . in principle the latter quantities may be inferred independently from inelastic neutron scattering and for example the temperature dependence of the resistivity in the normal state .",
    "the mean - field eliashberg theory is expected to break down when , for example , @xmath17 is so high that the superconducting coherence length becomes small and less than the typical spatial separation of cooper pairs .",
    "it may also fail in the immediate vicinity of the critical density when magnetic order is quenched continuously and the quasiparticle density of states tends to become singular . here",
    "the electron quasiparticle framework underpinning the mean - field eliashberg model may break down in an essential and non - trivial fashion .    within the range of validity of our calculations",
    "we may conclude that , for the same set of dimensionless parameters , the p - wave triplet pairing in nearly ferromagnetic metals is much less robust than the d - wave singlet pairing in the corresponding nearly antiferromagnetic metals . for values of @xmath28 that are typical of d metals in the layered perovskites",
    ", we predict a maximum of @xmath17 versus @xmath21 of the order of @xmath1 in the latter but typically one or more orders of magnitude less than this in the former .",
    "the reasons for the dramatic difference are discussed in section iv .",
    "the pair breaking effects of impurities and of competing interaction channels can lead to substantially lower values than the above in real materials .",
    "these effects may , however , be mitigated by reducing @xmath21 via some external control parameter such as pressure and hence enhancing the magnetic pairing energy .",
    "the calculations are intriguing in the light of the d - wave singlet state observed in the cuprates with strongly enhanced antiferromagnetic susceptibilities and @xmath17 s of the order of @xmath1 , versus the p - wave triplet state found in the ruthanate @xmath0 that is close to ferromagnetic order and has a much lower @xmath17 ( of the order of @xmath2 ) .",
    "the maximum of @xmath17 versus @xmath21 in @xmath0 in the triplet state is not yet known , and may well be higher than that measured at ambient pressure .",
    "a more complete description of @xmath0 must await realistic modelling of the dynamical susceptibility which may reflect not only ferromagnetic but also competing antiferromagnetic tendencies .",
    "the latter may be subdominant at ambient pressure but may be highly sensitive to lattice spacing .",
    "it would also be interesting to investigate more closely the effect of the additional fermi surface sheets in @xmath0 .",
    "an experimental study of the variation of @xmath17 vs @xmath21 in this system , that satisfies to a greater extent than cuprates the condition @xmath92 , would provide a vital test of the theory of magnetically mediated superconductivity .",
    "such a study would be feasible in @xmath0 if it orders ferromagnetically at positive pressure@xcite , and in the isostructural and isoelectronic compounds @xmath93 and @xmath94 that are expected to become similar to @xmath0 at very high pressure .",
    "finally we reiterate that our calculations suggests that one should look for elevated transition temperatures in systems in which ( i ) @xmath28 is high , i.e. the electron density is not too low and effective band mass not too high , ( ii ) the lattice or carrier density can be tuned to the vicinity of a magnetic critical point in the metallic state , ( iii ) the electronic structure is quasi 2d rather than 3d , and ( iv ) antiferromagnetism ( or ising ferromagnetism ) is favored over ferromagnetism . a considerable number of candidate materials for further study of the predictions of the magnetic pairing model would seem to be available given current material fabrication and high pressure technology .",
    "the experimental investigation of such systems , whether or not they prove to yield high transition temperatures , should help us to improve our understanding of magnetic pairing and perhaps also shed light on the more exotic models@xcite for normal and superconducting states that have been proposed for highly correlated electronic systems .",
