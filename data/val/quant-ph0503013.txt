    "quantum information theory ( qit ) revolves around the concept of entanglement @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is the product of combining the superposition principle of quantum mechanics with multipartite systems  described by tensor product of hilbert spaces .",
    "entanglement is central to transmiting information in a quantum communication protocol or processing information in a quantum computation .",
    "there are two basic open problems in the study of entanglement : separability and distillability .",
    "separability is concerned with two questions , namely , whether a quantum state is factorizable and if not , how much entanglement it contains .",
    "these questions are of great importance even in practice since entanglement amounts to interaction between two or more parties , and thus it demands more resources to establish an entangled state than a factorized one .    likewise , distillability @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite is concerned with two questions : whether a quantum state is distillable , and if it is , how to devise an explicit protocol to extract entanglement out of the initial low entangled state .",
    "the main focus of our paper is on the construction of distillation protocols , rather than a direct analysis of the distillability issue .",
    "the study of distillation protocols for qudits is justified since it is known that for mixed states of dimension higher than @xmath2 , it is neither known a complete critierion for separability nor for distillability @xcite .",
    "separability and distillability are interconnected .",
    "entanglement of a mixed state is a necessary condition for being distillable .",
    "however , it was quite a surprise to find that there exist states that though entangled , they can not be distilled .",
    "they are the bound entangled states that are characterized by being ppt ( positive partial transposition ) entangled states @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this situation soon raised the question of whether non - ppt states were all distillable .",
    "although there is not a conclusive answer , yet there is strong evidence that this is neither the case since werner states which are finite-@xmath3 undistillable have been found @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study entanglement distillation protocols for qudits using the recursion method @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the mixed states to be distilled are diagonal bell states of qudits , but they do not need to be tensor product of pairs of bell states . moreover , we can also distill non - diagonal states .",
    "we make significative progress in the understanding of these protocols and find new efficient variants of them by using number theory .",
    "this number theory enters in the properties of the module @xmath1 that appears in the labelling of the bell diagonal sates of qudits .",
    "local permutations acting on these states by means of unitary operations serve to construct generalized distillation protocols @xcite . as a byproduct",
    ", we also introduce heterotropic states as the invariant states under the group of local permutations .    as a result of this study",
    ", we find that qudit states with dimension @xmath0 a prime number are qualitatively and quantitatively the best choices for quantum distillation protocols based on the recursion method .",
    "qualitatively , since we show that for @xmath0 not a prime number there appear disturbing attractor points in the space of fidelity parameters that deviate the distillation process from the desired fixed point that represents the maximally entangled state .",
    "this phenomenon is absent when @xmath0 is a prime number and @xmath1 becomes a vector space .",
    "quantitatively , since we propose distillation protocols that when @xmath0 is a prime number , they distill all states with fidelity bigger than @xmath4 without resorting to twirling operations .",
    "we hereby summarize briefly some of our main results :    i/ we proof that the group of local permutations for qudits of arbitrary dimension @xmath0 is the semidirect product of the group of translations and simplectic transformations .",
    "this structure plays an important role in the distillation protocols for qudits .",
    "ii/ we simplify the problem of finding the best distillation protocol to that of finding the best set of coefficients of a certain polinomial constrained to the existence of a suitable vector space .",
    "iii/ we introduce the concept of _ joint performance parameter _",
    "@xmath5 that allows us the comparison of distillation protocols with different values of fidelity , probability of success and number of bell pairs used altogether .",
    "it is a figure of merit for low fidelity states above the distillation threshold where the recursion method is specially suited for distillation , prior to switching a hashing or breeding method .",
    "iv/ we analyze several distillation protocols assisted with twirling operations as the dimension @xmath0 of qudits vary .",
    "we find that the best performance according to @xmath5 is not achieved for qubits ( @xmath6 ) , but for qutrits ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 input pairs of bell states as shown in fig .",
    "[ grapheta ] and fig .",
    "[ graphd3 ] .",
    "we also find that it is not possible to improve @xmath5 by indefinitely increasing the number of input pairs @xmath3 .",
    "v/ we propose a distillation protocol without resorting to twirling operations for @xmath9 input bell states and @xmath10 output bell states that is iterative and its yield is greatly improved : about four orders of magnitude with respect to the protocols based on twirling , even for states quite near the fixed point .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ graphd3deutsch ] .",
    "vi/ we propose and study an extension of the quantum privacy amplification protocols @xcite that work for arbitrary dimension @xmath0 .",
    "vii/ we find indications of the existence of non - distillable nppt states by studying the distillation capacities of protocols for several values of @xmath0 , as shown in fig .  [ graphoptimdist ] .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in order to facilitate the reading and exposition of our results , we present the proofs of our theorems and technicalities of the numerical methods in independent appendices .",

    "[ sec6:level1 ] is devoted to conclusions and future prospects .",
    "the quantum systems we are going to consider are _ qudits _ , which are described by a hilbert space of dimension @xmath13 , and finite . the elements of a given orthogonal basis can be denoted @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "this set of numbers is naturally identified with the elements of the set modulus @xmath16 and we shall informally use them as if they belonged to @xmath17 . in general , whenever an element of @xmath17 appears in an expression , any integer in that expression must be understood to be mapped to @xmath17 .",
    "we consider two separated parties , alice and bob , each of them owning one of these systems .",
    "the entire hilbert space then is @xmath18 .",
    "a mixed state of the whole system is called _ separable _ when it can be expressed as a convex sum of _ product states _",
    "@xcite : @xmath19 a state which is not separable is said to be _",
    "elements of the _ computational basis _ of a pair of qudits shared by alice and bob are denoted as @xmath20 to shorthen the notation , it is convenient to introduce the symbols @xmath21 chosen so that @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "_ bell states _ are defined as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xmath25 bell states are an example of maximally entangled states .",
    "in fact , any maximally entangled state can be identified with the @xmath26 state by suitably choosing the computational basis of each of the qudits , due to the schmidt decomposition .",
    "the _ fidelity _ of a mixed state @xmath27 is defined as @xmath28 where the maximum is taken over the set of maximally entangled states .",
    "the aim of distillation protocols is to get maximally entangled pairs ( fidelity one ) by means of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , starting with entangled states of fidelity lower than one . because of the previous comment , we will always suppose , without lose of generality , that the initial fidelity of the states to be distilled is equal to @xmath29 , and the aim of our protocols will be to obtain distilled states as close as possible to this bell state .    of special interest are the mixtures of perfectly entangled states and white noise , known as _ isotropic states _ : @xmath30 where @xmath11 is the fidelity of the state .",
    "these states are known to be entangled and distillable iff @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the main interest of these states comes not only from their physical meaning , but also from the possibility of transforming any state in an isotropic one through a _ twirling _ operation . in general , the twirling consists in a random application of the elements of a certain group of unitary operations , say @xmath32 , to each of the systems in an ensemble .",
    "namely , its action is @xmath33 the result of such an operator must be a sum over the states invariant under the action of the group . in the case of isotropic states ,",
    "a suitable election is the set of transformations of the form @xmath34 .",
    "when managing multiple shared pairs , vector notation is necessary ; @xmath35 stands for @xmath36 .",
    "scalar product will be employed with its usual meaning .",
    "the generalization of the previous expressions is straightforward : @xmath37 again , @xmath38 for any @xmath39 . the computational basis and the bell basis",
    "are : @xmath40 with @xmath41 . in order to simplify the notation ,",
    "sometimes we will work with vectors over @xmath42 and write states as @xmath43 in the place of @xmath44 , with @xmath45      in general , @xmath46 is not a field and thus @xmath47 is not a vector space , but a module .",
    "we can still make use of some properties associated to vector spaces and so we will abuse a bit of the term vector . for a detailed exposition see appendix [ apendicevector ] , but it is enough to know the following . the usual definition of linear independence makes sense , as one can demonstrate that any linearly independent set of vectors can be extended to a complete base and also that a square matrix composed by such a set is invertible .",
    "a subspace is defined to be the set of linear combinations of a linearly independent set , and its dimension is the cardinality of these set of generators .",
    "orthogonality poses no problem , since the set orthogonal to a subspace is a subspace , and it has the expected dimension .",
    "working with this pseudo - vector space @xmath1 requires care .",
    "some vectors can be taken to the null vector by multiplying them by a non - zero number .",
    "for example , for @xmath48 we have @xmath49 . in order to classify this anomalous vectors , consider the set of divisors of d : @xmath50 this set inherits the ordering of @xmath51 , and we shall use this property to introduce a suitable @xmath52 function in @xmath17 :    [ defmcd ] for every @xmath53 we define the greatest common divisor of @xmath54 , or @xmath55 , to be the greatest @xmath56 such that @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "the nomenclature was chosen because for any @xmath59 and @xmath60 we have @xmath61 and then for any set of integers @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the corresponding set in @xmath17 .",
    ".values of the generalized euler s totient function @xmath65 for several qudit dimensions @xmath0 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     vectors over @xmath17",
    "are n - tuples of elements in @xmath17 , and so we extend the @xmath52 function to act over @xmath1 in the natural way , that is , if @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "now we can consider an equivalence relation in @xmath1 governed by the equality under the @xmath52 function .",
    "the corresponding partition consists in the sets : @xmath68 the most important of these sets is @xmath69 , since it contains those vectors @xmath70 for with @xmath71 is linearly independent .",
    "later we will need its cardinality when considering properties of local unitary operators acting on diagonal bell states .",
    "thus , it is useful to define : @xmath72 for the particular case of @xmath73 , @xmath74 corresponds to euler s totient @xmath75-function @xcite .",
    "euler s @xmath75-function appears naturally in number theory since it gives for a natural number @xmath3 , the cardinality of the set @xmath76 .",
    "that is , @xmath77 is the total number of coprime integers ( or totatives ) below or equal to @xmath3 . for example",
    ", there are eight totatives of 24 , namely , @xmath78 , thus @xmath79 . for @xmath80",
    ", we have therefore introduced a generalization of euler s totient function for elements in @xmath1 .",
    "the following lemma gives us how to compute the cardinalities of the sets @xmath81 , which shall naturally arise in our analysis of distillation protocols .",
    "[ lemaphi ] for every @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath59 :    1 .",

    "@xmath85 3 .",
    "@xmath86    the proof of this lemma can be found in appendix [ apendicephi ] . as an illustration",
    ", we list several values of @xmath65 in table  [ tablaphi ] .",
    "the main constraint alice and bob have to face when they intend to distill qudits is that they can perform only local operations .",
    "if we consider only unitary operations , we are led to the group @xmath87 of local unitary operations .",
    "its elements are all of the form @xmath88 in this section we shall study the subgroup @xmath89 , defined as the group of local unitary operations which are closed over the space of bell diagonal states , that is , states of the form @xmath90 where the label @xmath91 is a reminder that we are considering states of @xmath3 pairs of qudits .",
    "the aim is to use the acquired knowledge to devise distillation protocols specially suited for these states .",
    "more specifically , we analyze the group @xmath92 of local unitary operators over the space spanned by the tensor product of @xmath3 pairs of qudits of dimension @xmath0 for which the image of a bell diagonal state is another bell diagonal state .",
    "the first we notice is that the result of applying such an operator over a pure bell state is another bell state ( it can not be the convex sum of several bell states because it must remain pure ) .",
    "since the mapping of bell states must be one to one , the action of any @xmath93 involves a permutation of the bell states : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a permutation .",
    "so we introduce @xmath96 , the _ group of local permutations _ , as the set of permutations over @xmath97 implementable over bell states by local ( unitary ) means .    before stating the main result of this section",
    ", we shall define several groups .",
    "consider the family of unitary operators @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) over bob s part of the system such that by definition @xmath100 where conjugation is taken respect to the computational basis . with this operators at hand ,",
    "we construct the group @xmath101 with the elements @xmath102 .",
    "we claim that it is a subgroup of @xmath92 .",
    "an explicit calculation shows that the action of its elements is @xmath103 where @xmath104 is @xmath105 so the special feature of @xmath106 is that for @xmath107 bell diagonal @xmath108 , which means that its elements implement the identity permutation .",
    "we also define two subgroups of the group of permutations over @xmath97 . the _ translation group _ @xmath109 contains the permutations of the form @xmath110 with @xmath111 , and the _ symplectic group _",
    "@xmath112 contains in turn those whose action is @xmath113 where @xmath114 is such that @xmath115    @xmath112 is a finite non - simple group . a suitable generator set for this group",
    "is presented in appedix [ apendicegeneraps ] .",
    "now , we are in position to establish the following theorem that plays an important role in the distillation protocols for qudits to be devised later on .",
    "[ thmplocal ] @xmath116    1 .",
    "@xmath117 is the semidirect product of @xmath118 and @xmath119 :",
    "@xmath120 2 .",
    "given @xmath121 such that they yield the same permutation in @xmath117 , there exists @xmath122 such that @xmath123 where @xmath75 is a phase .",
    "we prove this theorem in appendix [ apendiceproofthm ] . for qubits ( @xmath6 ) ,",
    "part 1 of this theorem was proved in @xcite using a mapping between bell states and pauli matrices .",
    "our proof does not rely on this mapping and being completely different , it becomes general enough so as to treat all qudits of dimension @xmath0 on equal footing .",
    "@xmath118 is specially well suited to construct distillation protocols , and so it is worth a closer study of its properties .",
    "there is another interesting way of writing ; if we call @xmath124 the first @xmath3 rows ( columns ) of @xmath125 and @xmath126 the last @xmath3 rows ( columns ) , the condition can be rewritten in a canonical simplectic form : @xmath127 this point of view is specially useful when systematically constructing the elements of @xmath118 , thanks to the following result :    [ thmcardinalps ] @xmath116    1 .",
    "consider a linearly independent set of vectors @xmath128 with ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "if this set satisfies conditions , it is always possible to complete it preserving them .",
    "the cardinality of @xmath118 is @xmath130    we prove this theorem in appendix [ apendicecardinalps ] . as an illustration",
    ", we list several values of @xmath131 in table  [ tablaps ] . clearly numbers grow fast , which makes unfeasible any numerical investigation which requires going over the elements of the whole group even for not very large values of @xmath3 . in any case",
    ", it can be helpful to have an algorith which allows this task without the expense of storing the elements .",
    "consider any suitable ordering over @xmath97 .",
    "given an element of @xmath112 , we can increase its last row according to this order till another element is reached .",
    "if this fails , the same can be done for the previous row , and so on and so forth .",
    "however , this is not very efficient , and we can do it better combining part one of theorem [ thmcardinalps ] with lemma [ lemagrupo ] . for example , for any of the last @xmath3 rows we could substitute the search with the application of a suitable generator from lemma [ lemagrupo ] .",
    "then the additional information contained in the proof of theorem [ thmcardinalps ] would guarantee that we were not forgetting any element of the group .",
    "moreover , as we shall later see , tipically we are only interested in some of the rows of the matrix , and then part 1 of the theorem is crucial since it allows usto ignore unimportant rows .",
    "we now explore the possibility of using the groups of the previous section with the twirling operator , which for finite groups is : @xmath132 consider now the group @xmath101 . from",
    ", it follows @xmath133 which means that the action of @xmath134 over a state leaves bell diagonal elements invariant , whereas the off - diagonal components are sent to zero .",
    "the group @xmath118 can also be successfully used in twirling operations .",
    "this asseveration , however , has no meaning by itself since @xmath118 is not a group of transformations over the @xmath3 pairs of qudits .",
    "we have to choose any mapping @xmath135 such that @xmath136 there are many possible realizations for this mapping , and at least in general the image of the mapping is not a subgroup of @xmath89 .",
    "however , it _ is _ a group when considered as a set of transformations over bell diagonal states .",
    "thus , for @xmath27 bell diagonal the following makes sense : @xmath137 to perform the sum we need to know which are the states invariant under the action of the group .",
    "[ thmmcdinvariante ] for every @xmath138 , @xmath139 if and only if there exists a permutation in @xmath112 with associated matrix @xmath125 such that @xmath140 .",
    "the if direction follows from @xmath125 being invertible , since then @xmath141 iff @xmath142 .",
    "we now proof the only if direction .",
    "let @xmath143 and consider any @xmath144 such that @xmath145 ( note that @xmath146 ) .",
    "@xmath147 is linearly independent , and so there exists a matrix @xmath125 associated to a permutation in @xmath112 having @xmath148 as its first column ( see theorem [ thmcardinalps ] ) .",
    "then , if @xmath149 we have @xmath150 .",
    "the same reasoning is true for @xmath151 , giving @xmath152 and thus @xmath153 .",
    "now , let us recall the partition in @xmath97 associated to the function @xmath52 ( see ) .",
    "we define the related states @xmath154 these are the invariant states we were searching for .",
    "thus , if @xmath27 is bell diagonal : @xmath155 note that we have not taken into account the number of pairs involved , since it is unimportant .",
    "however , usually twirling operations are interesting for @xmath73 . in this case , in analogy with isotropic states , we shall call heterotropic states those states invariant under .",
    "if @xmath27 is not bell diagonal , we can still obtain the same result with the operator @xmath156 as a corollary , if @xmath0 is prime there are just two bell diagonal invariant states @xmath157 and thus the result of the twirling operation is an isotropic state , which is the simplest example of an heterotropic state .",
    "in the distillation protocols we consider , which are iterative , each iteration cycle can be decomposed in the following steps :    1 .   at start ,",
    "alice and bob share @xmath3 qudit pairs of dimension @xmath0 and state matrix @xmath107 .",
    "2 .   they apply by local means one of the permutations @xmath158 in .",
    "they measure the last @xmath159 qudit pairs , both of them in their computational basis .",
    "if the results of the measurement agree for each of the measured pairs , they keep the first @xmath160 pairs ( in the state @xmath161 ) .",
    "else , they discard them .    in most situations ,",
    "the initial @xmath3 pairs are independent and have equal state matrices @xmath27 . in these cases @xmath162 in general ( for @xmath163 ) this does not guarantee that @xmath161 will be a product state , however , and thus it is preferable to consider the most general case .",
    "the process can be performed several times in order to improve the entanglement progressively , but it is worth taking into account that a scheme of this kind with @xmath164 steps and , say , @xmath165 and @xmath166 , is equivalent to a single - step one with @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "it is enough to perform initially all the permutations and afterwards all the measurements .",
    "although convergence properties are the same , the equivalence is not complete since from a practical point of view the step by step method will give a better yield .",
    "this is so because an undesired result in the measurement is more harmful in the second case , as more pairs must be discarded at once .    in appendix [ apendicedestilacion ] we derive an expression for the state of the remaining pairs of qudits after a successful measurement .",
    "it appears that the protocol is blind to non diagonal states ( in the bell basis ) .",
    "so let us define @xmath169    if we call @xmath170 the space generated by the last @xmath159 rows of @xmath171 ( the matrix associated to @xmath172 ) the probability of obtaining the desired measure is @xmath173 and the recurrence relation for the probabilities is @xmath174 where @xmath175 and @xmath176 is @xmath177 note that since @xmath178 , rows @xmath179 to @xmath3 ( of @xmath171 ) do not take part in the expression , and therefore the protocol does not depend on them .",
    "consider the following family of heterotropic states : @xmath180 from theorem [ thmmcdinvariante ] we know that @xmath181 using this fact and equation , one can readily check that for @xmath182 gives @xmath183 .",
    "therefore , these heterotropic states are always fixed points of the protocol and candidates for attractors .    in the case of single - step protocols , we are only interested in the final joint fidelity ( the probability of the state being @xmath184 ) @xmath185 where the label @xmath186 reminds us that this is the joint probability of the @xmath160 pairs being in the desired state . in general",
    ", the fidelity of each pair will be greater .",
    "if @xmath166 these distinction vanishes , and we will simply write @xmath187 instead of @xmath188 . equations and show how the effect of the entire process relies only in the set @xmath170 , thereby reducing the search for efficient protocols according to part one of theorem [ thmcardinalps ] .",
    "we now consider the fourier transform of the probabilities @xmath189 to obtain @xmath190 where we have used @xmath191 with @xmath192 being a subspace of @xmath1 and @xmath193 .",
    "gathering these results , we have @xmath194 an expression for the final ( joint ) fidelity which can lighten its direct computation when holds , since for this case we can define for @xmath195 :    @xmath196      in order to understand better equation , we will adopt a useful simplification which generates by itself a whole family of distillation protocols .",
    "we consider only initial states for which the pairs are mutually independent and equal as in .",
    "moreover , before each iteration we introduce any twirling operation which leads to an isotropic state while preserving the fidelity , as in .",
    "this way the evolution of the state through the distillation protocol is described entirely by a single parameter , the fidelity @xmath11 .",
    "we would like to evaluate .",
    "we need : @xmath197 defining @xmath198 and @xmath199 , this implies that for any @xmath200 we have @xmath201 and @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the number of occurrences of @xmath204 in the product ( that is , @xmath205 ) . since @xmath206 ,",

    "after the permutation with associated matrix @xmath125 and phase function @xmath75 the state is @xmath481 the measurement is performed in the computational basis ( for the last @xmath159 pairs ) , and the rest of pairs are kept only if this measurement coincides for each of the measured pairs ( if alice measures @xmath482 , so does bob for the corresponding qudit ) .",
