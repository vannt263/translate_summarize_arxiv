    "the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) was made possible by the 2-degree field ( 2df ) fiber spectrograph , which was specifically conceived as a tool for performing a massive redshift survey to precisely measure fundamental cosmological parameters .",
    "the state - of - the - art redshift surveys of the early 1990 s , such as the las campanas redshift survey ( shectman  1996 ) and the _ iras _  point source catalog redshift survey ( saunders  2000 ) , either did not cover sufficiently large volumes to be statistically representative of the large - scale structure , or covered large volumes too sparsely to provide precise measurements .",
    "an order - of - magnitude increase in the survey volume and sample size was needed to enter the regime of `` precision cosmology , '' and this became the foundational goal of the 2dfgrs .",
    "the 2df spectrograph can observe 400 objects simultaneously over a 2-diameter field of view ( taylor & gray 1990 ; lewis  2002a ) , and was first placed on the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) in november 1995 .",
    "the first spectra were taken in mid-1996 , and scheduled observations with 2df at full functionality began in september 1997 .",
    "the first major redshift survey observing run occurred in october 1997 , with the survey passing 50,000 redshifts in mid-1999 ( colless 1999 ) and 100,000 redshifts in mid-2000 .",
    "the first 100,000 redshifts and spectra were released publicly in june 2001 ( colless et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the 200,000-redshift mark was achieved toward the end of 2001 .",
    "the survey observations were completed in april 2002 , after 5 years and 272 nights on the aat .",
    "the final survey is an order of magnitude larger than any previous redshift survey , and comparable to the ongoing redshift survey of the sloan digital sky survey ( bernardi , this volume ) .",
    "the source catalog for the 2dfgrs was a revised and extended version of the apm galaxy catalog ( maddox  1990 ) , which was created by scanning the photographic plates of the uk schmidt telescope southern sky survey .",
    "the survey targets were chosen to be galaxies with extinction - corrected magnitudes brighter than @xmath1 = 19.45 mag .",
    "the galaxies were distinguished from stars by the apm image classification algorithm described by maddox , conservatively tuned to include all galaxies at the expense of also including a 5% contamination by stars .",
    "the main survey regions were two declination strips , one in the southern galactic hemisphere spanning 80@xmath215  around the south galactic pole ( the sgp strip ) , and the other in the northern galactic hemisphere spanning 75@xmath210  along the celestial equator ( the ngp strip ) ; in addition , there were 99 individual 2df `` random '' fields spread over the southern galactic cap ( see fig .  [ 2dfgrs_regions ] ) .",
    "the large volume that is sparsely probed by the random fields allows the survey to measure structure on scales greater than would be permitted by the relatively narrow widths of the main survey strips . in total",
    ", the survey covers approximately 1800 deg@xmath3 , and has a median redshift depth of @xmath4 = 0.11 .",
    "an adaptive tiling algorithm was used to optimally place the 900 2df fields over the survey regions , giving a highly complete and uniform sample of galaxies on the sky .",
    "redshifts were measured from 2df spectra that covered the range from 3600   to 8000   at a resolution of 9.0  .",
    "redshift measurements were obtained both from cross - correlation with template spectra and from fitting emission lines .",
    "all redshifts were visually checked and assigned a quality parameter @xmath5 in the range 15 ; accepted redshifts ( @xmath5@xmath63 ) were found to be 98% reliable and to have a typical uncertainty of 85 .",
    "the overall redshift completeness for accepted redshifts was 92% , although this varied with magnitude .",
    "the variation in the redshift completeness with position and magnitude is fully accounted for by the survey completeness mask ( colless  2001 ; norberg  2002b ) .",
    "figure  [ 2dfgrs_slice ] shows a thin slice through the three - dimensional map of over 221,000 galaxies produced by the 2dfgrs .",
    "this 3-thick slice passes through both the ngp strip ( at left ) and the sgp strip ( at right ) .",
    "the decrease in the number of galaxies toward higher redshifts is an effect of the survey selection by magnitude  only intrinsically more luminous galaxies are brighter than the survey magnitude limit at higher redshifts .",
    "the clusters , filaments , sheets and voids making up the large - scale structures in the galaxy distribution are clearly resolved .",
    "the fact that there are many such structures visible in the figure is a qualitative demonstration that the survey volume comprises a representative sample of the universe ; the small amplitude of the density fluctuations on large scales is quantified by the power spectrum , as discussed in the next section .          in cosmological models where the initial density fluctuations form a gaussian random field , such as most inflationary models , the large - scale structure of the galaxy distribution in the linear regime",
    "is completely characterized in statistical terms by just two quantities : the mean density and the rms fluctuations in the density as a function of scale .",
    "the latter are quantified either through the two - point correlation function or the power spectrum , which are fourier transforms of each other .",
    "however , a redshift survey does not determine the real - space positions of the galaxies , but rather the redshift - space positions , where the line - of - sight component is not the distance to the galaxy but the galaxy s velocity .",
    "this velocity is the combination of the hubble velocity ( which _ is _ directly related to the distance ) and the galaxy s peculiar velocity ( the motion produced by the gravitational attraction of the local mass distribution ) .",
    "the statistical properties of the large - scale structure of the galaxy distribution observed in redshift space are summarized in figure  [ 2dfgrs_stats ] , which shows both the correlation function and the power spectrum obtained from the 2dfgrs .",
    "the structure on very large scales ( several tens to hundreds of mpc ) is best represented by the power spectrum ; on smaller scales , where peculiar velocities become more significant and the shape of the power spectrum ( as well as the amplitude ) differs between redshift space and real space , the redshift - space structure is most clearly shown in the two - dimensional correlation function ( see  [ 2dfgrs_dist ] below ) .",

    ", this implies a mean mass density @xmath16 .",
    "the power spectrum also shows some evidence for acoustic oscillations produced by baryon - photon coupling in the early universe ( see  [ 2dfgrs_omega ] ) .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ 2dfgrs_stats ] shows the redshift - space two - point correlations as a function of the separations along and across the line of sight , and reveals two main deviations from circular symmetry due to peculiar velocity effects . on intermediate scales , for transverse separations of a few tens of mpc , the contours of the correlation function are flattened along the line of sight due to the coherent infall of galaxies as structures form in the linear regime .",
    "the detection of this effect in the 2dfgrs is a clear confirmation that large - scale structure grows by the gravitational amplification of density fluctuations ( peacock  2001 ) , and allows a direct measurement of the mean mass density of the universe ( see  [ 2dfgrs_omega ] ) .",
    "the other effect is the stretching of the contours along the line of sight at small transverse separations .",
    "this is the finger - of - god effect due to the large peculiar velocities of collapsed structures in the nonlinear regime .",
    "a fundamental issue in employing redshift surveys of galaxies as probes of cosmology is the relationship between the observed galaxy distribution and the underlying mass distribution , which is what cosmological models most directly predict .",
    "some bias of the galaxies with respect to the mass is expected on theoretical grounds , but the nature and extent of the effect was not previously well determined .",
    "the large size of the 2dfgrs has allowed a thorough investigation of this question .",
    "the simplest model for galaxy biasing postulates a linear relation between fluctuations in the galaxy distribution and fluctuations in the mass distribution : @xmath17 . in this case",
    "the galaxy power spectrum is related to the mass power spectrum by @xmath18 .",
    "such a relationship is expected to hold in the linear regime ( up to stochastic variations ) .",
    "the first - order relationship between galaxies and mass can therefore be determined by comparing the measured galaxy power spectrum to the matter power spectrum based on a model fit to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum , linearly evolved to @xmath19 and extrapolated to the smaller scales covered by the 2dfgrs power spectrum . applying this approach , lahav  ( 2002 ) find that the linear bias parameter for an @xmath20 galaxy at zero redshift is @xmath21 $ ] , where @xmath22 is the optical depth due to reionization and @xmath23 is the spectral index of the primordial mass power spectrum .    an alternative way of determining the bias employs the higher - order correlations between galaxies in the intermediate , quasi - linear regime .",
    "the higher - order correlations are generated by nonlinear gravitational collapse , and so depend on the clustering of the dominant dark matter rather than the galaxies .",
    "thus the stronger the higher - order clustering , the higher the dark matter normalization , and the lower the bias .",
    "an analysis of the bispectrum ( the fourier transform of the three - point correlation function ) by verde  ( 2002 ) yields @xmath24 , a result based solely on the 2dfgrs .",
    "moreover , including a second - order quadratic bias term does not improve the fit of the bias model to the observed bispectrum .    for the blue - selected 2dfgrs sample",
    ", it therefore seems that @xmath20 galaxies are nearly unbiased tracers of the low - redshift mass distribution .",
    "however , this broad conclusion masks some very interesting variations of the bias parameter with galaxy luminosity and type ( fig .  [ 2dfgrs_b ] ) .",
    "norberg  ( 2001 , 2002a ) show conclusively that the bias parameter varies with luminosity , ranging from @xmath25 for bright galaxies to @xmath26 for faint galaxies .",
    "the relation between bias and luminosity is well represented by the simple linear relation @xmath27 .",
    "they also find that , at all luminosities , early - type galaxies have a higher bias than late - type galaxies .",
    "a detailed comparison of the clustering of passive and actively star - forming galaxies by madgwick  ( 2003 ) shows that at small separations , the passive galaxies cluster much more strongly , and the relative bias ( @xmath28 ) is a decreasing function of scale . on the largest scales , however , the relative bias tends to a constant value of around 1.3 .    5 , relative to an @xmath20 galaxy ( norberg  2002a ) .",
    "the bias variations of the full 2dfgrs sample are compared to subsamples with early and late spectral types , and to earlier results by norberg  ( 2001 ) .",
    "the right panel shows the relative bias of passive and actively star - forming galaxies as a function of scale , over the range 0.220  ( madgwick  2003).,title=\"fig : \" ] 5 , relative to an @xmath20 galaxy ( norberg  2002a ) .",

    "the compression of structures along the line of sight due to coherent infall is quantified by the distortion parameter @xmath29 ( kaiser 1987 ; hamilton 1992 ) .",
