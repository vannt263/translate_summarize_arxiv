    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are short - period binaries in which a late - type , roche - lobe filling secondary star transfers matter through an accretion disk onto a rotating , accretion heated primary white dwarf ( wd ) . the standard evolutionary paradigm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hnr ) postulates that cvs evolve from wide binaries of moderate orbital period and unequal masses .",
    "as the more massive component evolves off of the main sequence into a red giant , the secondary star finds itself orbiting within the atmosphere of the massive star . during this common envelope phase",
    ", the orbit of the secondary star shrinks due to interactions with the atmosphere of the more massive primary star .",
    "this shortens the binary period , until the common envelope is ejected around orbital periods of 1 day .",
    "angular momentum is then mainly lost through an efficient magnetically constrained wind , (  magnetic braking  , see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , shrinking the orbit so much that the roche lobe of the secondary star comes into contact with the stellar surface and mass transfer begins , signaling the birth of a long period cv .",
    "as the system evolves , the secondary star continues to lose mass , but angular momentum losses keep the secondary star in contact with its roche lobe .    during their lives as longer period cvs , orbital periods typically range from 3 to 10 hours , and mass transfer rates from @xmath1 to @xmath2 yr@xmath3 .",
    "this rapid mass transfer drives the secondary star out of thermal equilibrium , causing it to become bloated by @xmath430% compared to an isolated star at the same mass @xcite .",
    "the secondary continues to lose mass until it reaches the fully convective boundary ( @xmath5 hrs , @xmath6 ) , where the magnetic breaking is believed to be disrupted .",
    "the secondary star is able to regain its thermal equilibrium , and as a result shrinks and loses contact with its roche lobe ceasing mass transfer . with the disruption of magnetic breaking from the secondary star , angular momentum in the system",
    "is lost via gravitational radiation alone , causing the orbit to decrease at a much slower rate .",
    "this continues until the orbit has shrunk sufficiently for the secondary star to overflow its roche lobe and begin mass transfer once again ( @xmath7 hrs ) . with the absence of mass transfer between orbital periods of 2 - 3 hours , the systems are dormant , and consequently , difficult to identify",
    "this forms a gap in the observed orbital period distribution of cvs between 2 - 3 hours .",
    "once mass transfer resumes , the system emerges as a `` sub - gap '' cv .",
    "it is assumed that this evolutionary sequence happens on a short enough timescale that the secondary star does not undergo any significant nuclear evolution , and therefore should retain normal abundance patterns consistent with a main sequence dwarf .",
    "observational evidence , however , shows a growing number of systems with apparent abundance anomalies seen in the uv and/or the ir ; in the uv , this is seen as unusual / ratios @xcite , and in ir , this is inferred through the presence of anomalously weak or absent co features .",
    "@xcite show that for thirteen out of the nineteen systems observed , the co features of non - magnetic cvs above the period gap are much weaker than they should be for their spectral types .",
    "since the water vapor features in the coolest of these stars appears normal , this result points towards a deficit of carbon .",
    "in addition , @xmath8c appeared to be enhanced for several systems , an indication of cno processed material in the atmosphere of the secondary star @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these non - magnetic cvs above the gap , the majority ( 8/11 systems ) of `` polars '' , cvs with highly magnetic wd primaries , have secondary stars that appear to be completely normal @xcite .",
    "pre - cv systems appear uniformly normal , with only one of nineteen systems showing any weakened co features @xcite .",
    "while the total cv sample is somewhat small and limited to the brightest objects observable with ground - based near - ir spectroscopic instrumentation , these trends are striking enough to warrant further attention and examination of all cv subtypes .",
    "observations of short period , sub - gap cvs are extremely challenging given the very low luminosities expected for the secondary stars that must compete against that of accretion and the underlying hot white dwarf .",
    "ir spectroscopy of cvs has been possible since the early 1990 s , notably with the efforts of @xcite looking at systems well above the 2 - 3 hour period gap , where absorption lines from the secondary were clearly seen .",
    "@xcite observed five systems below the period gap , and found that the secondary stars were too faint to detect and estimated that they contribute only 10 to 30% to the observed infrared flux .",
    "@xcite and @xcite focused on lower resolution studies of sub - gap systems , fitting k or m dwarf template spectra to low resolution optical and near - ir spectra .",
    "this technique was employed by @xcite who used the subaru telescope to obtain @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11-band low resolution grism spectroscopy of five cvs below the gap .",
    "spectral component fitting allowed them to obtain rough spectral type estimates ranging from m1 to l1 , but the low resolution of these data ( fwhm @xmath12 ) prevented examination of the co features .    to attempt to detect the secondary stars in a sample of sub - gap cvs ,",
    "we have obtained moderate resolution @xmath11-band spectra of nine systems .",
    "this increases the sample of cvs with moderate resolution ( r @xmath0 1500 ) near - ir spectroscopy to sixty - one systems : nineteen pre - cvs , thirty - one non - magnetic systems , and eleven magnetic or partially magnetic systems .",
    "prior to this work , three quarters of the non - magnetic systems were _ above _ the period gap and only four below : rz leo , wz sge , gw lib , and ei psc .",
    "@xcite presented the @xmath11-band spectrum of rz leo , which showed no evidence of a c deficit manifested as weakened or absent co features .",
    "@xcite obtained moderate resolution observations vy aqr and ei psc , finding evidence for strong deficits of c in both systems .",
    "@xcite presented observations of wz sge , showing this object to have both co and h@xmath13 emission from its accretion disk , the only such detection so far .    in our nine observed systems , we clearly detect the presence of the secondary star in six of them . in two of the remaining cases , we are able to provide constraints on their spectral types , and in only one system we could not detect the signature of the secondary star .",
    "in contrast to the longer period cvs , the majority of these secondary stars have co features that appear to be present at near - normal strengths .",
    "we present our observations in  [ obs ] , the object spectra and spectral type determinations in  [ results ] , a discussion of our results in  [ disc ] , and our conclusions in  [ conc ] .",
    "infrared spectroscopy for the program objects was carried out at the european southern observatory ( eso ) at cerro paranal , chile , with the infrared spectrometer and array camera ( isaac ) @xcite on the 8.2 meter very large telescope ( vlt ) antu in service mode between may and august of 2008 .",
    "additional infrared data were obtained for both rz leo and ex hya utilizing nirspec @xcite at the w. m. keck observatory on mauna kea .",
    "an observation log describing the observations is presented in table [ obslog ] , listing the observation dates and times for each system , the exposure times , the number of observations at each nodded position , and the percentage of the orbital phase covered by the observations .",
    "the isaac data were obtained in the standard infrared abba nodding pattern , moving the object between two positions on the spectrograph slit to aid in the removal of sky background .",
    "these data were taken using the medium resolution grating and a 0.6  slit , giving a resolving power of @xmath14 and a dispersion of @xmath15   pixel@xmath3 across the 1024 pixel square isaac science ccd .",
    "we used two wavelength centers ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) giving sufficient overlap to construct a composite spectrum covering @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "the observing conditions varied during the observation period but , in general , these data were obtained in fair conditions with seeing generally less than 1.25  as reported by the differential image motion monitor ( dimm ) at the vlt .",
    "several problems appeared during the observation run , however , that affected the quality of these data .",
    "several large dust particles appeared on the detector , degrading the cosmetics and compromising the spectral extraction .",
    "this specifically impacted the data for v436 cen and v893 sco .",
    "in addition , significant drift in the central wavelength positions were observed , particularly if the center position was changed before , or after , a telluric standard was observed . using night sky lines as a wavelength calibration source mitigated this effect , but in general telluric correction and wavelength calibration",
    "were more challenging than expected .",
    "the final spectra for our program objects are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figone ] .",
    "both ex hya and rz leo were observed using nirspec at the w. m. keck observatory , using a 0.380  slit and a low resolution grating covering approximately 2.04 to 2.46 @xmath20 with a dispersion of 4.27   pixel@xmath3 .",
    "these data were obtained in the standard infrared abba nodding pattern , and reduced using the idl routine redspec .",
    "the data reduction process followed the description given in @xcite .",
    "both objects had telluric corrections applied in redspec using observations of featureless a0v stars close to the program objects to remove atmospheric absorption lines , and to avoid any differences in telluric absorption dependent on airmass .",
    "we used arc lamps to provide a wavelength calibration .",
    "the spectrum for rz leo has been presented in @xcite , but we include it here to compare it to our results for the other sub - gap systems in fig .",
    "[ fig : figone ] .",
    "standard data reductions of the vlt data were carried out using eso gasganointerface and the common pipeline library ( cpl ) using the isaac reduction recipes version 5.7.0 .",
    "the pipeline obtains a wavelength calibration by examining the night sky lines in each data frame , and corrects for field curvature using arc lamp frames collected at the end of each night as well as dividing by a flat field .",
    "it then detects the spectrum present in each input frame , shifting and co - adding to produce a single output spectrum .",
    "modifications were made to this pipeline to output the individual corrected frames , which could then be properly combined after the reduction process to account for the significant radial velocity motions of the secondary star . while we were able to obtain a well corrected spectrum for each system , the resulting radial velocity curves were extremely noisy and are not presented here .",
    "the modifications to the cpl recipes were checked for accuracy by also examining the data with standard irafmethods ( _ apall _ , _ identify _ , etc . ) and found to give indistinguishable results .",
    "telluric features were removed using nearby a0v standard stars observed close to the same airmass as the program objects .",
    "telluric standard stars were in general observed at the end of each night , within @xmath21 airmasses of the program objects . in most cases",
    "only one telluric standard was observed each night .",
    "these followed the same reduction process as the data frames , but instead used the single combined output from the reduction pipeline since radial velocity smearing was not an issue .",
    "the most appropriate standard was then divided into the observation using the iraf task _ telluric _ , which allows scaling and shifting the standard to best match the atmospheric absorption lines present in the data .",
    "care was taken to not scale or shift the standard too much and introduce spurious absorption or emission lines to our program object spectra .",
    "in addition to the spectra of the cvs , we obtained spectra of three late - type dwarf templates : lhs 427 , lhs 2347 , and lhs 3003 .",
    "each reference object was compared against standards taken from the irtf spectral library @xcite as a check on the spectral reductions , and the spectral types we derive are consistent with those reported in the simbad database .",
    "the observing log of the m stars observed as part of our program can be found in table [ obslog ] .",
    "when necessary , these three m star templates were supplemented with additional , lower resolution ( @xmath22 ) spectra from the irtf spectral library for comparison purposes .",
    "in the following , we attempt to assign spectral types to the secondary stars of our program objects if they are clearly visible .",
    "the triplet at @xmath23 and the doublet at @xmath24 are good indicators of effective temperature ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , thus we use both as an indication of spectral type .",
    "as the effective temperature decreases from m0 , the doublet gets stronger and the triplet gets weaker .",
    "the accretion disks in these systems are bright , and provide a flat power - law continuum that veils the absorption lines from the secondary star making a direct visual comparison to template spectral types as described in  [ mstars ] more difficult . to overcome this , prior work @xcite has focused on component fitting a range of stellar template spectra with a variable power law component to represent contributions from the disk to the _ j_,_h _ , and/or _ k _ band observations .    as a prelude to more in - depth",
    "synthetic spectral modeling currently underway , we take a very simplistic , yet effective , approach to get first estimates of the spectral types of the secondary stars visible in these data .",
    "the visible features in each object spectrum were enhanced using the iraf task _ sarith _ to raise the spectrum to some constant power , and then fit from @xmath18 to @xmath25 @xmath20 with a linear function using _ continuum _ to remove the overall continuum slope .",
    "we do not fit the continuum over the entire spectral range because of the presence of broad co bands and changes in the continuum shape due to the onset of strong water vapor absorption past @xmath26 @xmath0 2.28 @xmath20 , both noted by @xcite .",
    "the very broad h@xmath13o features depress the continuum , especially in later spectral types , making it difficult to ascertain its true level in the continuum fitting process .",
    "the region between the doublet and the triplet , our primary spectral type indicators , is relatively free of other contaminating sources , so we are confident that the lines are undistorted by this process .",
    "these object spectra are then compared by eye to the irtf spectral templates described in  [ mstars ] .",
    "the high accretion disk contamination and low s / n of some of these data lead us to conclude that this approach was the best for determining the spectral types of these secondary stars .",

    "eighteen of the nineteen pre - cv systems observed show co appropriate for their spectral type , with the exception of the triple system hs1136 which showed no absorption features from the secondary star , likely due to the presence of an extremely hot wd in the system . among the magnetic cv s ,",
    "only three of the eleven show unusual co strengths : gk per , ae aqr , and v1309 ori .",
    "both ae aqr and gk per are thought to harbor subgiant secondary stars @xcite , so this is not unexpected . among the non - magnetic , long period systems ,",
    "there are thirteen out of nineteen systems that either show absent or weakened co features , and five systems that appear more or less normal . including the systems presented here , three out of the twelve short period sub - gap systems clearly show weaker co than expected for their spectral type : z cha , vy aqr , and ei psc .",
    "there is strong evidence for a hot k - type secondary in ei psc @xcite , unexpected given its ultra - short period ( @xmath85 hr ) .",
    "it should have a very late type companion , but the ir spectroscopy confirms the mid - k spectral type , and reveals a secondary star with extraordinarily weak co features .",
    "the results for vy aqr ( @xmath95 hr ) are not as clear , as the spectral type of the secondary star derived from the vlt ( @xmath4 m6 ) and keck ( @xmath4 m0 ) datasets are quite different . no matter the classification , the co features in the secondary star of vy aqr were extremely weak . for z cha ,",
    "the case is not as strong , though it appears that the co strength is weaker than would be expected .",
    "further observations are needed to verify the spectral type of the donor star in z cha .    in all the cases where we see weak or non - existent co absorption in the atmosphere of the secondary star ,",
    "we interpret this as a deficit in the c abundance .",
    "while we have ir spectra for a small percent of all cvs , uv spectroscopy is uncovering evidence of c depleted material through the detection of unusual n v / c iv line ratios .",
    "studies in the uv ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have long shown that the / ratio in the uv spectra of a number of cataclysmic variables was very high , suggesting a strong enhancement of nitrogen and/or a deficit of carbon in the accretion disk or in the wd photosphere .",
    "uv observations of a large sample of polars by @xcite , however showed that they had normal / line ratios .",
    "these two taken together imply that matter transfered from the secondary star in non - magnetic systems is the source of the uv abundance anomalies , and that these stars have cno processed material in their atmospheres .",
    "table [ biglist ] highlights the five cases where we do have deficiencies in c seen both in the uv and in the ir : ey cyg , ei psc , ae aqr , u gem , and v1309 ori . the most natural explanation of this result is that c depleted material is being transfered from the secondary star to the white dwarf / accretion disk . @xcite",
    "provide a discussion of why the c deficient material must be flowing from the secondary star onto the white dwarf / accretion disk and not in the other direction .",
    "the link between the abundances seen in the uv and the ir can be further strengthened by looking at two cases where normal c abundances in the uv are matched by normal c abundances in the ir : ss aur and vw hyi .",
    "ss aur is a typical dwarf nova above the period gap ( @xmath96 hr ) , and appears to have normal co features in the spectrum presented by @xcite .",
    "analysis of the uv spectra of ss aur by @xcite show that it has normal c and n abundances .",
    "our spectrum of vw hyi presented here show it to be a normal m4 dwarf , and while previous uv spectroscopy suggested a sub - solar c abundances @xcite , more recent analysis ( e. sion , private communication ) suggests that the c abundance in vw hyi is close to solar . to put this potential uv - ir cno connection to the test",
    ", it should be seen whether an anomaly in one can be used to predict an anomaly in the other .",
    "it is therefore critical to obtain ir spectra of the three sub - gap systems that are known to show unusual uv c / n ratios : bc uma , sw uma , and bw scl @xcite .",
    "it is a challenge to completely explain why pre - cv , short period , and magnetic systems in general appear to have normal c abundances , while the long period systems do not .",
    "one possible way to explain `` normal '' c abundances at short periods was demonstrated by @xcite . for their models where",
    "the secondary has evolved off of the main sequence before contact , they show that the surface c abundance in the secondary star declines throughout most of its life as a cv ( see their fig .",
    "16 ) until its mass reaches @xmath97 .",
    "after this point the surface c abundance returns to normal as material from deeper layers within the star , unaffected by the cno cycle that operated prior to contact , are convected to the surface .",
    "however , the standard model for cv evolution does not give the secondary star sufficient time to evolve off the main before starting mass transfer .",
    "still , if the angular momentum braking mechanisms are less efficient than is currently believed , then the secondary would have additional time to undergo nuclear evolution .    to explore this possibility ,",
    "we briefly consider the standard paradigm for the formation of the period gap . as",
    "the secondary approaches the fully convective boundary at the top of the period gap ( @xmath5 hrs , @xmath6 ) , magnetic braking is believed to be disrupted as the tachocline , the interface region of strong shear between the radiative and convective zones ( and believed to be the site responsible for generating the magnetic field ) is lost , shutting down the dynamo ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "currently , however , there exists evidence both for , and against , the disruption in magnetic breaking near the convective boundary .",
    "@xcite found evidence for this disrupted magnetic breaking mechanism in a survey of sdss post common envelope binaries ( pcebs ) , examining the fraction of pcebs compared to non - interacting white dwarf plus main sequence binaries ( wdms ) .",
    "in the case of disrupted magnetic braking , there is a predicted steep decrease in the number of pcebs at the fully convective boundary due to their much longer evolutionary timescales .",
    "this was seen in their survey of sdss selected systems . also supporting the disrupted magnetic breaking scenario ,",
    "@xcite was only able to detect rotation ( @xmath98 ) in seven out of 122 m dwarfs , of which four of these were past the fully convective boundary .",
    "they suggest that this demonstrates that magnetic breaking is less effective at the convective boundary .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the seven stars with detected rotation all showed high levels of stellar activity .",
    "conversely , @xcite state that there is nothing `` magical '' about the angular momentum loss rate or stellar activity levels at the fully convective boundary .",
    "this is supported by additional data for low mass stars in clusters ( c.f . * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , @xcite show that there is a dramatic _ increase _ in the dynamo generating processes at the fully convective boundary    supposing that the secondary star becoming fully convective is not a reasonable method for producing the period gap , is there an alternative method for shutting down the magnetic braking ?",
    "one possible method to offset the influence of the high levels of magnetic activity seen at the fully convective boundary , with the weaker magnetic braking observed for these stars , is to suppose that the field topology changes from a predominantly large scale toroidal configuration seen in stars with radiative zones ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to a much more complex , non - axisymmetric topology in fully convective stars . in this case",
    ", the global field might more closely resemble a collection of multi - polar structures whose individual field strengths fall off rapidly with distance , resulting in a much weaker global field than in the dipole case .",
    "such fields would have limited numbers of `` open field '' lines along which to transport material , and thus much lower magnetic braking ( see * ? ? ?",
    "but recent observations by @xcite show that v374 peg , a rapidly rotating ( @xmath99 hr ) , fully convective m4v has a large scale axisymmetric poloidal ( dipole - like ) field .",
    "a similar result was found for the m4 dwarf gl 490b by @xcite .",
    "recent polarimetric observations across the m dwarf sequence @xcite point towards a sharp transition in magnetic field topology at 0.5 , below which the poloidal field topology dominates and its strength increases as mass decreases .",
    "@xcite do note that it is possible to see wildly different magnetic topologies between objects with similar stellar parameters , suggesting that another parameter ( perhaps age ? ) could play a role in the observed topology . in any case , there is strong evidence that the majority ( 85% ) of the magnetic energy remains locked - away in smaller structures @xcite .",
    "perhaps it is the factor of @xmath100 increase ( compared to v374 peg ) in rotational velocity for cv secondaries at the top of the period gap that is sufficient to eliminate the large scale poloidal field and disrupt the otherwise efficient magnetic breaking .",
    "one characteristic of rapid rotating late - type stars is that much of the stellar activity is located closer to the poles of these objects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in some cvs polar spots",
    "are seen @xcite , while in others the spots are more equatorial @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that if a spot is located near the pole , the stellar wind structure is dramatically affected , and that total mass and angular momentum loss is substantially higher than if the spots were equatorial . unless it is found that the spots on cvs are preferentially located near the equatorial regions , this explanation seems unable to produce the desired result .    while observations of the magnetic field structures in low mass stars is improving , as is our understanding of the generation of their magnetic dynamos , the extension of this knowledge to explain the cv period gap is incomplete .",
    "since there is one , and only one property that all cvs at the top of the period gap must share , a three hour rotation period , it must be that rotation somehow quenches the efficient magnetic dynamo generation in fully convective stars .",
    "we have performed a near - ir spectroscopic moderate resolution survey of nine sub - gap cvs , detecting a signature of the secondary star in eight systems .",
    "we demonstrate an important link between abundance anomalies seen in the uv and in the ir , as well as the reverse cases where the lack of abundance anomalies appear .",
    "our clear detections show that future phase - resolved spectroscopy will further constrain the nature of these secondary stars by obtaining radial velocity measurements and therefore masses of the secondary stars in these systems .    while our results indicated",
    "a large fraction of sub - gap cvs contain a normal co abundance , we have insufficient objects to fully test this idea at present .",
    "ongoing analysis and modeling of these data presented here will allow us to explore the co bands seen in our spectra . to fully assess the @xmath101 ratio which gives the best indication and possibility to see if the secondary star contains any cno processed material @xcite , but will require higher quality data .",
