    "magnetic x - ray scattering ( mxrs ) is a well developed technique for probing the magnetic and electronic structures of materials .",
    "the foundations of the theory of mxrs were laid down by blume .",
    "@xcite later on blume and gibbs @xcite developed the theory further to show that the orbital and spin contributions to the magnetic moment can be measured separately using mxrs with a judicious choice of experimental geometry and polarization of the x rays .",
    "@xcite presented a nonrelativistic theory of x - ray resonance exchange scattering and wrote down explicit expressions for the electric dipole ( @xmath0 ) and quadrupole ( @xmath1 ) contributions .",
    "this work is based on an atomic model of magnetism and has been applied successfully to a variety of materials including uas and gd by fasolino _",
    "et al._. @xcite rennert @xcite produced a semi - relativistic theory of mxrs written in terms of green s functions , but no such calculations have been performed .",
    "more recently , theory based on an atomic model of the electronic structure of materials has been written down by lovesey @xcite and co - workers and applied successfully to a variety of materials .",
    "et al . _ have reported a theory which includes the band structure in the calculation of anomalous x - ray scattering .",
    "@xcite a first - principles theory of mxrs based on a time - dependent second order perturbation theory and density functional theory @xcite was produced by arola _",
    "_ @xcite and applied successfully to several transition metal materials .",
    "@xcite this theory is restricted in its range of application because of the limitations imposed by the local density approximation to dft which means that the theory can only be applied to simple and transition metal materials .",
    "this is particularly unfortunate because it is in the rare earth and actinide materials that the most exotic magnetism in the periodic table occurs .    in recent years advances in electronic structure calculations beyond the local density approximation",
    "have broadened the range of materials for which numerically accurate electronic structure calculations can be performed .",
    "in particular the lda+u method @xcite and the self - interaction corrected local spin density approximation to density functional theory @xcite have met with considerable success in describing materials with localized electrons .",
    "the latter method reduces the degeneracy of the @xmath2 states at the fermi level and hence also circumvents all the convergence problems associated with the lsd approximation to dft in electronic structure calculations for rare earth materials .",
    "notably , the sic - lsd has provided a very good description of the rare earth metal and rare earth chalcogenide crystal structures .",
    "@xcite a relativistic version of the sic formalism has been derived @xcite that has been shown to yield an excellent description of the electronic structure of rare earth materials in the few cases to which it has been applied .",
    "this method is reviewed by temmerman _",
    "et al._. @xcite    the fact that electromagnetic radiation can be scattered from the magnetic moments of spin-1/2 particles was first shown by low , and by gell - mann and goldberger half a century ago .",
    "@xcite later on it was platzman and tzoar @xcite who first proposed the use of x - ray scattering techniques to study the magnetization density of solids . at that time progress in studying magnetic structures using x rays",
    "was severely hampered because the cross section for magnetic scattering is smaller than the cross section for charge scattering @xcite by a factor of @xmath3 .",
    "it was gibbs _",
    "@xcite who first observed a large resonant enhancement of the cross section when the energy of the x ray is tuned through an absorption edge .",
    "since that time technological advances have produced high resolution , high intensity synchrotron radiation sources that have transformed magnetic x - ray resonant scattering into a practical tool for investigating magnetic and electronic structures of materials . nowadays",
    "the world s leading synchrotron facilities have beamlines dedicated to this technique @xcite and applications of resonant x - ray scattering are burgeoning .",
    "reviews of the experimental state - of - the - art mxrs techniques have been written by stirling @xcite and cooper .",
    "@xcite    other approaches to interpreting mxrs spectra exist , particularly the successful methods based on group theory and angular momentum algebra that result in sum rules as described by borgatti @xcite and by carra @xcite and luo .",
    "@xcite the present work should not be regarded as a rival theory to these , but rather as an attempt to extend the range of density functional methods to describe magnetic scattering of x rays in the same way as is done for photoemission and other spectroscopies .",
    "@xcite as a dft - based theory our work is , of course , based on very different approximations to this earlier work , making direct comparison between the two theories problematic .    we have recently implemented a first - principles theory of mxrs that is based on a standard time - dependent perturbation theory where the scattering amplitudes are calculated to second order in the electron - photon interaction vertex . to describe mxrs from a given material it is necessary to have an accurate description of the electronic structure of the material in question .",
    "this is provided by using the sic within the lsd approximation to the density functional theory which is implemented using the relativistic spin - polarized lmto - asa band structure calculation method .",
    "@xcite the theory of mxrs is equivalent to that of arola _ et al . _ , @xcite but has been rewritten in a form that is appropriate for implementation in connection with the lmto - asa method where there is substantial experience of sic methods .",
    "the major step forward reported in this paper is the integration of the sic into the mxrs theory which enables us to describe rare earth and actinide materials on an equal footing with transition and simple materials .    in this paper",
    ", we give a detailed description of the mxrs theory and illustrate it in a calculation for praseodymium .",
    "the results are analysed and discussed .",
    "finally we show that the present work is consistent with the earlier theory and demonstrate how the mxrs cross section reflects the properties of these materials .",
    "the sic - lsd approximation @xcite is an _ ab - initio _ electronic structure scheme , that is capable of describing localization phenomena in solids .",
    "@xcite in this scheme the spurious self - interaction of each occupied electron state is subtracted from the conventional lsd approximation to the total energy functional , which leads to a greatly improved description of static coulomb correlation effects over the lsd approximation .",
    "this has been demonstrated in studies of the hubbard model , @xcite in applications to 3@xmath4 monoxides @xcite and cuprates , @xcite @xmath2-electron systems , @xcite orbital ordering , @xcite metal - insulator transitions @xcite and solid hydrogen .",

    "in this section we discuss a series of calculations to illustrate the relativistic mxrs theory we have developed within the sic - lsd method for ordered magnetic crystals , and to demonstrate explicitly what information is contained in the x - ray scattering cross section . for this",
    "we have chosen to examine fcc praseodymium for a detailed analysis of the theory .",
    "the reasons for this choice are as follows : ( i ) praseodymium contains two localized @xmath2-electrons .",
    "therefore , it is the simplest @xmath2-electron material for which we can to a large extent alter both the spin and orbital contributions to the magnetic moment by selectively choosing beforehand for which electrons we apply the sic correction .",
    "( ii ) being ferromagnetic and fcc it has only one atom per primitive cell and is therefore computationally efficient to work with . while the fcc structure is not the observed ground state of pr , it has been fabricated with this structure at high temperatures and pressures .",
    "( iii ) using nonrelativistic sic - lsd we have obtained good agreement with experiment for the valence and equilibrium lattice constant of praseodymium .",
    "( iv ) preliminary calculations indicate that for the rare earth @xmath238 and @xmath239 edges the mxrs spectra are , to first order , independent of crystal structure , so the results we obtain may be provisionally compared with experiment .",
    "we have performed a self - consistent fully relativistic sic - lsd calculation of the electronic structure of praseodymium at a series of lattice constants on the fcc structure and found a minimum in the total energy as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the results are presented in terms of the wigner - seitz radius .",
    "there is are variety of different methods for obtaining the experimental lattice constant .",
    "firstly we can use the wigner - seitz radius that corresponds to the same volume per atom on the fcc lattice as is found in the naturally occuring dhcp crystal structure @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath240 a.u .",
    "secondly we can take the room temperature value which is obtained experimentally from flakes of pr by quenching in an arc furnace .",
    "this yields @xmath241 a.u .",
    "and we can take the value reported by kutznetsov @xcite , @xmath242 a.u . which was measured on samples at 575 k. clearly our calculated value of @xmath243 a.u .",
    "is in excellent agreement with these values .",
    "following earlier work by myron and liu @xcite sderlind performed a comprehensive first - principles study of the electronic structure of pr using the full potential lmto method which shows that the fcc phase is stable at pressures between 60 and 165 kbar @xcite .",
    "calculations employing the sic within a non - relativistic framework have been performed by temmerman _",
    "_ @xcite and by svane _",
    "@xcite    .this table displays the @xmath2-states selected for self - interaction correction and the self - consistently calculated spin and orbital magnetic moments of those states .",
    "the first column simply labels different configurations of localized states , the second column gives the @xmath244 and @xmath245 quantum numbers of the states from which self - interactions have been removed .",
    "columns 3 and 4 are the calculated spin and orbital contribution to the total magnetic moment from the self - interaction corrected @xmath2-electrons shown in column 2 .",
    "columns 5 and 6 are the calculated total spin and orbital contribution to the magnetic moment from all electrons in fcc pr . note that the spin moment is fairly constant for all the selected configurations .",

    "[ fig8 ] we have chosen to apply the self - interaction corrections to the @xmath2-electrons which correspond to @xmath246 and @xmath247 in the nonrelativistic limit ( configuration 11 in table i ) .",
    "this time it is the @xmath248 and @xmath249 states that are localized , and again there is no @xmath249 character around @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath250 and @xmath251 state have the spin - split behaviour close to @xmath70 in this case .",
    "the other values of @xmath214 behave as before .",
    "it is clear from figures [ fig6 ] to [ fig8 ] that in some @xmath214 channels there is a small amount of band - like @xmath2-character below the fermi energy .",
    "this indicates that there are two types of @xmath2-electron in our calculation , the localised @xmath2-electrons which determine the valence and the delocalised @xmath2-electrons which determine the valence transitions .",
    "@xcite it is the delocalised @xmath2-electrons that are principally responsible for the non - integer values of the orbital moments shown in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , ( although there is also a small contribution from the valence @xmath252 electrons ) .",
    "comparison of the corresponding diagrams in figures [ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] , and [ fig8 ] shows dramatic differences . even though the total density of states is fairly insensitive",
    "to which @xmath2-electron states are occupied , the @xmath214-decomposed density of states is obviously drastically altered depending on which electrons are localized . in particular the @xmath2-states just above the fermi energy form a significant number of the intermediate states in the formal theory described earlier . therefore if key ones are localized they become unavailable as intermediate states for the spectroscopy and the cross section may be substantially altered .",
    "of course , occupying one @xmath2-state means that some other @xmath2 state is not occupied which may then also play a role as an intermediate state for the spectroscopy .",
    "indeed , how much the unavailability of particular @xmath214 substates affects the spectra depends on other factors too , including the @xmath0 selection rules which are composed of angular matrix elements .",
    "each angular matrix element contains four terms in the form of a product of clebsch - gordan coefficients and a geometry and polarization dependent factor .",
    "a further influence is the fact that the lmto coefficients @xmath66 ( defined in eq . (",
    "17 ) and completely determined by a self - consistent band structure calculation ) associated with the @xmath2-electrons are found to be fairly independent of the rare earth element under consideration but their magnitude has a clear but complex linear proportionality to @xmath244 .",
    "detailed analysis of the major contributions to the cross section suggests that the highest peak is formed by the core - to - valence transitions @xmath253 for the @xmath238 lcp(rcp ) edge scattering and @xmath254 for the @xmath239 lcp(rcp ) edge scattering .",
    "the former transition for @xmath238 case is in agreement with the nonrelativistic selection rule which forbids a @xmath255 transition , although this transition is not totally forbidden in the relativistic @xmath0 selection rule . in the @xmath239 case ,",
    "the @xmath256 transition is observed to form part of the shoulder rather than contributing to the main peak .",
    "furthermore , within the transitions forming the main peak , the contribution to the lcp scattering at both the @xmath238 and @xmath239 edge is the largest from the most positive allowed @xmath214 value of the core state . on the other hand ,",
    "the most negative @xmath214 value of the core state gives the largest contribution to the rcp scattering .",
    "this indicates the fact that the clebsch - gordan coefficients which are used to calculate the selection rules are a dominant factor in determining the relative size of the cross section peaks .",
    "the origin of this is simply in the properties of the clebsch - gordan coefficients which vary smoothly between either 0 and 1 or 0 and -1 depending on the values of the other quantum numbers .",
    "from these considerations , we see that the separation of the lcp and rcp peaks by 1 to 2 electronvolts is a reflection of the spin - splitting of the states . in relativistic theory @xmath245 and @xmath244 are not good quantum numbers .",
    "furthermore , because of the magnetism , different values of @xmath46 with the same @xmath214 are also coupled .",
    "however , it is still possible to associate @xmath257 , @xmath258 with these quantum numbers and also to recognize the dominant @xmath46 in atomic - like unhybridized bands .",
    "for example , in the case of lcp scattering at the @xmath238 edge , the largest contribution to the cross section comes from @xmath259-like orbitals .",
    "the two 4@xmath2 states which have this @xmath214 as the main contributor are characterized by @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "electronic structure calculation shows that the former state is dominated by @xmath262 and the latter by @xmath263 .",
    "therefore the @xmath238 lcp peak is most affected by the availability of the spin - down @xmath264 state as an intermediate state .",
    "similar analysis shows that the @xmath238 rcp peak is most affected by spin - up @xmath265 state , @xmath239 lcp by spin - up @xmath266 , and @xmath239 rcp by spin - down @xmath267 state .",
    "although this analysis is a gross simplification , it does explain why the relative peak energy positions in the lcp and rcp scattering cases swap between the @xmath238 and @xmath239 edges ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "of course this is true only if these states are still available after the chosen localizations by sic .",
    "the effect of localization on the mxrs spectrum is most dramatic if sic is applied to these key states , changing the peak energy separation as well as the scattering amplitude between the lcp and rcp scattering cases .",
    "some empty valence band @xmath2 states participating in the scattering process have nearly equal mixture of the two @xmath46 characters , i.e. @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",
    "if there is strong spin - up and spin - down character in the unoccupied valence states described by a specific @xmath214 then both spin states may be available as the intermediate states for the spectroscopy .",
    "thus we may clearly see a two - peak structure in the @xmath214 decomposed amplitude for a certain polarization at the absorption edge .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] shows the core @xmath214 decomposed lcp scattering amplitude and the two - peak structure mentioned above is clearly visible for @xmath270 at the @xmath238 edge .        in certain cases we can interpret the apparent relation between the magnetic cross section and the @xmath74-component of the total orbital moment as follows . because @xmath271 holds",
    ", then we see that if we apply self interaction corrections to states systematically according to hund s rules , what is effectively done is to occupy the states in order of @xmath214 .",
    "as stated earlier the @xmath214 decomposed relativistic magnetic scattering cross section has a proportionality to @xmath214 due to the clebsch - gordan coefficient in the angular matrix element expression defining the @xmath0 selection rules .",
    "whether this proportionality is direct or inverse depends on the polarization of x rays .",
    "in addition , according to the electronic structure calculation , as the unhybridized state goes from @xmath272 to @xmath273 , the dominant @xmath46 changes from @xmath274 to @xmath275 gradually .",
    "this tells us two things .",
    "firstly we notice that if a certain state has a major impact on the scattering cross section at the @xmath238 edge for rcp photons , then this same state has a relatively minor effect on the cross section for lcp photons at the same edge because of the clebsch - gordan factor in the expression for the @xmath0 selection rules as mentioned above .",
    "secondly we see that this same state also has only a minor effect on the @xmath239 cross section because the value of @xmath46 for the intermediate states involved in major transition differ between @xmath238 and @xmath239 .    as the sic configuration varies from @xmath276 and @xmath277 to @xmath278 and @xmath279 so that there is a systematic change in the @xmath74-component of the total orbital moment , the @xmath238 rcp cross section increases because the second , third and so on , strongest contributors to the cross section become additionally available as intermediate states as they are released from the sic localization .",
    "however , they have progressively less impact as we proceed through this series of quantum numbers since the major @xmath46 gradually changes to @xmath275 . the cross section at the @xmath238 edge for lcp photons is not affected much by this change in quantum numbers since neither the initial nor the final sic combination in the above series involves the major contributors to @xmath238 lcp cross section . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath239 edge lcp cross section is reduced as more and more significant contributors are removed from the available intermediate states , while the cross section at the @xmath239 edge for rcp photons is not much affected for the same reason as @xmath238 lcp case . obviously the above change in sic configuration is very artificial .",
    "however as the states are filled up according to hund s rule as we proceed through the rare earth series , we would expect to observe changes in the cross section governed by these considerations for rare earths where the intermediate states can be considered as atomic - like .",
    "however , a very different interpretation of the x - ray spectra may be required in the case where delocalized band - like intermediate states are of primary importance , as is the case in resonant x - ray scattering at the @xmath280 and @xmath281 edges .",
    "finally , we are unaware of any experimental measurements of the mxrs spectra of praseodymium or it compounds at the @xmath238 or @xmath239 edge .",
    "however a careful combined neutron @xcite and x - ray @xcite ( at the @xmath281 edges ) investigation into the magnetism of ho@xmath282pr@xmath283 alloys has concluded that the pr ion does have a 4@xmath2 moment at all values of @xmath284 .",
    "_ @xcite have performed mxrs measurements at the @xmath285 edges in nd / pr superlattices and found a large peak at the absorption edge and a high energy shoulder corresponding to dipolar transitions to the broad 5@xmath4 band .",
    "we hope that our calculations will stimulate detailed experimental x - ray studies of @xmath238 and @xmath239 edges of pr , in pure pr and in its alloys and compounds .",
    "in conclusion , a theory of magnetic x - ray scattering that is based on the lsd with self - interaction corrections and second order time - dependent perturbation theory has been described .",
    "we have illustrated the theory with an application to fcc praseodymium and used this example to illustrate the dependence of the scattering cross section on spin and orbital magnetic moments .",
    "it has been shown that the theory quantitatively reproduces the dependence on the spin and orbital magnetic moments originally predicted qualitatively @xcite .",
