    "the hele - shaw problem involves two inmiscible newtonian fluids that interact in a narrow gap between two parallel plates .",
    "one of them is of higher viscosity and the other is effectively inviscid .",
    "the model under consideration is valid when surface - tension effects in the plane of the cell are negligible . in the most of the cases",
    "it is known that when a fluid region is contracting , a finite time blow - up can occur , in which a cusp forms in the free surface .",
    "the solution does not exist beyond the time of blow - up .",
    "however , saffman and taylor in 1958 @xcite discovered the long time existence of a continuum set of long bubbles within a receding fluid between two parallel walls in a hele - shaw cell that further have been called the saffman - taylor fingers .",
    "it is worthy to mention that the first non - trivial explicit solution in the circular geometry has been given by polubarinova - kochina and galin in 1945 @xcite .",
    "they also have proposed a complex variable approach , that nowadays is one of the principle tools to treat the hele - shaw problem in the plane geometry ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "following these first steps several other non - trivial exact solutions have been obtained ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . through the similarity in the governing equations ( hele - shaw and darcy )",
    ", these solutions can be used to study the models of saturated flows in porous media .",
    "another typical scenario is given by witten - sander s diffusion - limited - aggregation ( dla ) model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in both cases the motion takes place in a laplacian field ( pressure for viscous fluid and random walker s probability of visit for dla ) .",
    "one of the ways , in which several new exact solution have been obtained , is to perturb known solutions .",
    "for example , howison @xcite suggested perturbations of the saffman - taylor fingers that led him to new fingering solutions keeping the same asymptotic behavior as time @xmath0 .",
    "recently , hele - shaw flows and saffman - taylor fingering phenomenon have been studied intensively in wedges ( see , e.g. , @xcite nad the references therein ) . in particular , kadanoff @xcite suggested a self - similar interface evolution between two walls in a hele - shaw cell expressed explicitly by a rather simple parametric function with a logarithmic singularity at one of the walls . by this note",
    "we perturb kadanoff s solution and give new explicit solutions with similar asymptotics .",
    "we suppose that the viscous fluid occupies a simply connected domain @xmath1 in the phase @xmath2-plane whose boundary @xmath3 consists of two walls @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the corner and a free interface @xmath6 between them at a moment @xmath7 .",
    "the inviscid fluid ( or air ) fills the complement to @xmath1 .",
    "the simplifying assumption of constant pressure at the interface between the fluids means that we omit the effect of surface tension .",
    "the velocity must be bounded close to the contact point that yields the contact angle between the walls of the wedge and the moving interface to be @xmath8 ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "a limiting case corresponds to one finite contact point and the other tends to infinity . by a shift",
    "we can place the point of the intersection of the wall extensions at the origin . to simplify matter , we set the corner of angle @xmath9 between the walls so that the positive real axis @xmath10 contains one of the walls and fix this angle as @xmath11 $ ] .    in the zero - surface - tension model neglecting gravity",
    ", the unique acting force is pressure @xmath12 .",
    "the velocity field averaged across the gap is given by the hele - shaw law ( darcy s law in the multidimensional case ) as @xmath13 .",
    "incompressibility implies that @xmath14 is simply @xmath15 the dynamic condition @xmath16 is imposed on the free boundary @xmath17 .",
    "the kinematic condition implies that the normal velocity @xmath18 of the free boundary @xmath19 outwards from @xmath1 is given as @xmath20 on the walls @xmath21 and @xmath22 the boundary conditions are given as @xmath23 ( impermeability condition ) .",
    "we suppose that the motion is driven by a homogeneous source / sink at infinity .",
    "since the angle between the walls at infinity is also @xmath9 , the pressure behaves about infinity as @xmath24 where @xmath25 corresponds to the constant strength of the source ( @xmath26 ) or sink ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "finally , we assume that @xmath28 is a given analytic curve .",
    "we introduce the complex velocity ( complex analytic potential ) @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the stream function",
    ". then , @xmath31 by the cauchy - riemann conditions .",
    "let us consider an auxiliary parametric complex @xmath32-plane , @xmath33 .",
    "we set @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and construct a conformal univalent time - dependent map @xmath39 , @xmath40 , so that being continued onto @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and the circular arc @xmath43 of @xmath44 is mapped onto @xmath19 ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this map has the expansion @xmath45 about infinity and @xmath46 .",
    "the function @xmath47 parameterizes the boundary of the domain @xmath1 by @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "we will use the notations @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the normal unit vector in the outward direction is given by @xmath52 therefore , the normal velocity is obtained as @xmath53 the superposition @xmath54 is the solution to the mixed boundary problem ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) , ( [ 4 ] ) in @xmath55 , therefore , it is the robin function given by @xmath56 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath57 the first lines of ( [ 6 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) give us that @xmath58 the resting lines of ( [ 6 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) imply @xmath59",
    "we are looking for a solution in the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is regular in @xmath55 with the expansion @xmath62 about infinity .",
    "the branch is chosen so that @xmath63 , being continued symmetrically into the reflection of @xmath55 is real at real points .",
    "the equation ( [ 8 ] ) implies that on @xmath43 the function @xmath63 satisfies the equation @xmath64 taking into account the expansion of @xmath63 we are looking for a solution satisfying the equation @xmath65 changing the right - hand side of the above equation one would obtain other solutions . the general solution to ( [ eq ] )",
    "can be given in terms of the gauss hypergeometric function @xmath66 as @xmath67    ht    we note that @xmath68 vanishes for @xmath69 , therefore , the function @xmath47 is locally univalent , the cusp problem is degenerating and appears only at the initial time @xmath70 and the solution exists during infinite time .",
    "the resulting function is homeomorphic on the boundary @xmath41 , hence it is univalent in @xmath55 .",
    "this presents a case ( apart from the trivial one ) of the long existence of the solution in the problem with suction ( ill - posed problem ) . to complete our solution we need to determine the constant @xmath71 .",
    "first of all we choose the branch of the function @xmath72 so that the points of the ray @xmath73 have real images .",
    "this implies that @xmath74 .",
    "we continue verifying the asymptotic properties of the function @xmath75 as @xmath76 .",

    "we present numerical simulation in figure  [ fig14 ] .",
    "the special case of angle @xmath81 has been considered by kadanoff @xcite .",
    "the hypergeometric function is reduced to arctangent and we obtain @xmath82 this function maps the domain @xmath83 onto an infinite domain bounded by the imaginary axis @xmath84 , the ray @xmath85 of the real axis and an analytic curve @xmath19 which is the image of the circular arc , see figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "kadanoff s solution ( [ kadanoff ] ) can be thought of as a logarithmic perturbation of a circular evolution with the trivial solution @xmath86 .",
    "a simple way to generalize the solution ( [ kadanoff ] ) is to perturb another function .",
    "for example , one may choose @xmath87 we find the solution @xmath88 in the form @xmath89 similarly to the preceding section .",
    "then the equation ( [ 8 ] ) is satisfied when @xmath90 where @xmath91 as @xmath92 in the unit circumference .",
    "we choose a consistent form of @xmath93 as @xmath94 integration yields @xmath95 where @xmath71 is a constant of integration . satisfying the conditions on the walls we deduce that @xmath96 , and finally , we get a logarithmic perturbation of the elliptic evolution as @xmath97 see the interface evolution in figure  [ fig19 ] .",
    "the next goal is to obtain perturbations of the logarithmic term of kadanoff s solution that with the same asymptotic as @xmath98 , such that the interface has finite contact points at a finite moment .",
    "let us consider the function @xmath99 the functions @xmath100 , @xmath101 are to be chosen such that equation ( [ 8 ] ) is satisfied for the moving interface as well as the conditions of impermeability and univalence hold .",
    "the local univalence is followed from the first restriction @xmath102 . substituting @xmath103 into equation ( [ 8 ] ) and comparing the fourier coefficients ,",
    "we derive the following system of equations for the functions @xmath100 and @xmath101 : @xmath104 this system can be easily solved and the first integrals are @xmath105 @xmath106 where @xmath107 are the constants of integration .",
    "let us assume the initial condition @xmath108 .",
    "making use of the system ( [ u1],[u2 ] ) we arrive at the explicit function @xmath109 inverse to @xmath100 @xmath110 that exists , is continuous , and increases in the interval @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath100 increases from @xmath112 to @xmath113 as @xmath114 . by ( [ u1 ] )",
    "we conclude that @xmath115 as @xmath98 .",
    "the rotation of @xmath103 is exactly kadanoff s solution when @xmath116 , and @xmath101 is appropriately chosen as in ( [ kadanoff ] ) . to make a numerical simulation",
    "one may use the newton method of the solution of a non - linear system ( howison @xcite presented the numerical approximation of an analogous solution in a narrow channel ) , see figure  [ fig20 ] .    choosing @xmath112 rather close to 1",
    ", one may give an explicit analytic approximation by , e.g. , introducing two functions @xmath117 @xmath118 the initial conditions @xmath112 and @xmath119 are to satisfy the inequalities @xmath120 , @xmath121 . to proceed , we simplify putting @xmath122 .",
    "then these inequalities are satisfied for @xmath123 .",
    "it is easily seen from ( [ u2 ] ) that @xmath124 .",
    "then @xmath125 too . similarly , @xmath126 and @xmath127",
    "both @xmath128 and @xmath100 tend to 1 rapidly and the error @xmath129 is of the same order for @xmath130 .",
    "now we evaluate the error @xmath129 for @xmath131 , and claim that @xmath132 to prove this we estimate the distance @xmath133 between the inverse function   and @xmath134 as @xmath135 the derivative of @xmath136 is @xmath137 since the function @xmath138 increases , the function @xmath133 may have a critical point @xmath139 , @xmath140 , which is the maximal solution to the equation @xmath141 in the interval @xmath142 .",
    "the latter equation implies @xmath143 that proves  .",
    "moreover , @xmath144 is decreasing and non - negative as a function of the initial condition @xmath112 , that vanishes as @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , given a small positive number @xmath146 , we may choose @xmath122 close to 1 such that @xmath128 approximates @xmath100 with the precision @xmath146 during the whole time @xmath131 .",
    "desired quantity @xmath112 satisfies the equation @xmath147 a similar conclusion may be made for the function @xmath101 and its approximation @xmath148 ( note that @xmath149 ) .",
