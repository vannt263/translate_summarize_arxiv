    "we have used the synthesis code by @xcite , updated by @xcite and newly revised now.the basic grid is composed by single stellar populations ( ssp ) for five different imf s .",
    "the first one is a @xcite power law with masses between 0.85 and 120 m@xmath0 .",
    "the others imfs are @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite functions , with masses between 0.15 and 100 m@xmath0 .",
    "the isochrones are those from @xcite for 6 different metallicities : z @xmath1 0.0004 , 0.001 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 and 0.05 . the age coverage is from @xmath2 5.00 to 10.30 with a variable time resolution which is @xmath3 in the youngest stellar ages .",
    "the wc and wn stars are identified in the isochrones according to their surface abundances .",
    "the atmosphere models are from @xcite with an excellent coverage in effective temperature , gravity and metallicities , for stars with teff@xmath4 k. for o , b and wr we have taken the nlte blanketed models by @xcite at z@xmath10.001 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 and 0.04 .",
    "there are 110 for o - b stars , with 25000 k @xmath5 k and @xmath6 , and 120 for wr stars ( 60 wn @xmath7 60 wc ) , with 30000 k @xmath8 k and @xmath9 for wn , and with @xmath10 k and @xmath11 for wc . t@xmath12",
    "and r@xmath12 are the temperature and the radius at a roseland optical depth of 10 .    to assign a model to each wr star",
    ", we use the relationships among opacity , mass loss and wind velocity : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the h surface abundance , is taken as 0.2 for wn and 0 for wc .",
    "the mass loss is : @xmath16 with @xmath17 taking @xmath18 .",
    "integrating these equations we find r@xmath12 and then we select the closer atmosphere model .    for post - agb and pn with teff from 50000 to 220000 k",
    "we take the nlte models by @xcite . for higher temperatures we use black bodies .",
    "the resulting seds and hr diagrams are available in the vo .",
    "the use of nlte blanketed models produce less hard ionizing photons than old models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which explains in antural way the emission line ratios in low excitation high metallicity hii regions .",
    "previous work needed a steeper imf or mass segregation in small cluster , in disagreement with evidences from hst of the existence of very massive stars even in small clusters .",
