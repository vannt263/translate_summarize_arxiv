    "the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies form a sample of small galaxies which , due to their relatively nearby locations and close association with the milky way could in principle furnish crucial observational and theoretical information on a range of astrophysical phenomena . as these systems are eventually disrupted and incorporated into the milky way they illustrate locally one of the mechanisms thought to be responsible for the build up of large galaxies . thus comparing their stars and those now found in our galaxy we can obtain a first estimate of the relevance of late mergers ( unavane et al .",
    "dynamical studies of their stars have yielded valuable constraints on the nature and structure of dark matter halos at the smallest scales ( lin & faber 1983 , gerhard & spergel 1992 ) .",
    "their orbits probe the galactic halo in a range of distances not sampled by any other objects and can thus be used to study the outer galactic halo .",
    "additionally , their small sizes make them in principle the simplest galactic systems , where key processes such as star formation and gas flows can be studied under relatively well defined conditions .",
    "however , this situation is complicated by the fact that we not only lack a theoretical understanding of these systems , but also an observational record of their evolution ; only a present day snapshot of their physical parameters is available , as is the case with most galactic systems . whilst high redshift observations have recently opened up new areas of research as they begin to yield an statistical description of the evolution of bright galaxies , such an approach is likely to remain out of reach for these small systems for some time .",
    "fortunately , their neighboring locations allow the study of their individual stars , which offers the possibility of directly probing their evolutionary histories by inferring star formation rates as a function of time , @xmath2 .",
    "the recent availability of detailed colour - magnitude diagrams for several nearby systems has prompted the development and allowed the application of careful statistical methods aimed at reconstructing the star formation histories of these objects ( e.g. chiosi et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , aparicio et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and mould et al .",
    "( 1997 ) using magellanic and local clusters , and mighell & butcher ( 1992 ) , smecker - hane et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , tolstoy & saha ( 1996 ) , aparicio & gallart ( 1995 ) and mighell ( 1997 ) using local dsph s ) .",
    "although much has been learnt of the complex @xmath2 of these systems , existing studies have lacked two major ingredients : a homogeneous set of observations including several of the dsph galaxies does not exist , and different data sets are generally analyzed using different techniques .",
    "these two points make comparisons between the derived @xmath2 at best risky .",
    "a further difficulty lies in the fact that the available rigorous statistical studies approach the problem parametrically , which is something one should try to avoid when the actual structure of the function one is trying to recover can be crucial , as is the case when the underlying physics is unknown .",
    "an example of this last point is the case of the carina dwarf .",
    "hurley - keller et al . ( 1998 ) solve for the best fitting three discrete bursts solution to the @xmath0 and conclude that star formation has proceeded spasmodically , whilst mighell ( 1997 ) uses a non parametric star count approach , albeit not a fully consistent statistical method , to obtain a more gradual solution for carina s @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper we have attempted to improve on the determination of the star formation histories of local dsph systems by addressing the two points mentioned above .",
    "we use recent hst observations of the resolved populations of a sample of dsph galaxies ( carina , leoi , leoii , ursa minor and draco ) uniformly taken and reduced , to recover the @xmath0 of each , applying a new non - parametric maximum likelihood method .",
    "this allows meaningful comparisons to be made , as any systematics , at any level , will affect all our galaxies equally .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows : in section 2 we discuss the observations , in section 3 we include a brief outline of our method , which was introduced in our paper i ( hernandez et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the results are presented in section 4 , and in section 5 we summarize our results .",
    "the main requirements of our observations were that they should comprise a homogeneous sample of local dsph galaxies , mostly in terms of the data reduction .",
    "only such an internally consistent data set allows robust comparisons between different galaxies , once uniform data reduction and analysis methods are adopted .",
    "we extracted available archive hst data for the carina , leoi , leoii , ursa minor and draco galaxies , and used standard data reduction methods and standard hst calibration numbers throughout the sample ( e.g. elson et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the currently available data cover only small ( and variable ) sections of the total extent of these systems .",
    "this fact clearly limits the inferences which can be drawn to the small observed fractions , the star formation histories of these regions might not by representative of the average for a whole galaxy .",
    "while this limitation introduces an extra uncertainty to our results , it highlights the interesting possibility of studying spatial variations in the evolutionary histories of dsph galaxies , if comprehensive hst studies where undertaken . in the above sense",
    ", our results for the different galaxies refer in the strictest sense only to the fractions covered by the observed fields .    as we did not require the hr diagrams to extend much fainter than the oldest turnoff points ( @xmath3 ) , or to be complete into the faintest limits ( the faintest stars were in fact excluded from the analysis ) the data reduction was straightforward .",
    "our resulting cmds do not show any systematic difference from comparable published ones for the galaxies we study .",
    "the technical details of the images used appear in the appendix .",
    "in this section we give a summary description of our hr diagram inversion method , which was described extensively in our paper i. in contrast with other statistical methods , we do not need to construct synthetic colour magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) for each of the possible star formation histories being considered .",
    "rather we use a direct approach which solves for the best @xmath0 compatible with the stellar evolutionary models assumed and the observations used .          as the weak metallicity dispersions measured in the galaxies we are studying ( around 0.3 dex ) are comparable to the errors in the metallicity determinations themselves , we have not attempted to introduce any enrichment histories for any of our galaxies .",
    "in fact , as small internal metallicity spreads present in these galaxies would introduce only small differential age offsets in our inferred @xmath0 ( see table i ) , we shall in all cases use single metallicity isochrone sets .",
    "once a metallicity has been selected , we use the latest padova isochrones ( fagotto et al .",
    "1994 , girardi et al .",
    "1996 ) together with a detailed constant phase interpolation scheme using only stars at constant evolutionary phase , to construct an isochrone library having a chosen temporal resolution .    in this case",
    "we implement the method with a resolution of 0.15 gyr , sufficient for our present problem .",
    "it is one of the advantages of the method that this resolution can be increased arbitrarily ( up to the stellar model resolution ) with computation times scaling only linearly with it .",
    "our only other inputs are the positions of , say @xmath5 observed stars in the hr diagram , each having a colour and luminosity , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . starting from a full likelihood model , we first construct the probability that the @xmath5 observed stars resulted from a certain @xmath0 .",
    "this will be given by :        in the above expression @xmath10 is the density of points along the isochrone of age @xmath11 , around the luminosity of star @xmath12 , and is determined by the assumed imf together with the duration of the differential phase around the luminosity of star @xmath12 . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are a maximum and a minimum time needed to be considered , for example 0 and 15 gyr .",
    "@xmath15 is the amplitude of the observational errors in the colour of the stars , which are a function of the luminosity of the stars .",
    "this function is supplied by the particular observational sample one is analyzing .",
    "finally , @xmath16 is the colour the observed star would actually have if it had formed at time @xmath11",
    ". we shall refer to @xmath17 as the likelihood matrix , since each element represents the probability that a given star , @xmath12 , was actually formed at time @xmath11 . since the colour of a star having a given luminosity and age can sometimes be multi - valued function , in practice we check along a given isochrone , to find all possible masses a given observed star might have as a function of time , and add all contributions ( mostly 1 , sometimes 2 and occasionally 3 ) in the same @xmath17 . in this construction we are only considering observational errors in the colour , and not in the luminosity of the stars .",
    "the generalization to a two dimensional error ellipsoid is trivial , however the observational errors in colour dominate the problem to the extent of making this refinement unnecessary .",
    "although the amplitude of luminosity errors is only a factor of @xmath18 smaller than colour errors , as can be inferred from the fact that cmd diagrams typically display a range of luminosities 5 times larger than in colour , in discriminating between isochrones , errors in colour are @xmath19 times as important as errors in luminosity .",
    "the absence of a colour dependence from @xmath10 is a direct consequence of having neglected errors in the luminosity of the stars .",
    "a star of a given observed luminosity and assumed age will thus have a colour determined by the isochrones used .",
    "equation ( 2 ) is essentially the extension from the case of a discrete @xmath0 used by tolstoy & saha ( 1996 ) , to the case of a continuous function ( continuous in time , but obviously discrete with respect to the stars ) in the construction of the likelihood .",
    "the challenge now is to find the optimum @xmath0 without evaluating equation ( 2 ) i.e. without introducing a fixed set of test @xmath0 cases from which one is selected .",
    "the condition that @xmath20 has an extremal can be written as @xmath21 and a variational calculus treatment of the problem applied .",
    "firstly , we develop the product over @xmath12 using the chain rule for the variational derivative , and divide the resulting sum by @xmath22 to obtain :                this in effect has transformed the problem from one of searching for a function which maximizes a product of integrals ( equation 2 ) to one of solving an integro - differential equation ( equation 4 ) .",
    "we solve this equation iteratively , with the boundary condition sfr(15)=0 .",
    "details of the numerical procedure required to ensure convergence to the maximum likelihood sfr(t ) can be found in our paper i , where the method is tested extensively using synthetic hr diagrams .",
    "the main advantages of our method over other maximum likelihood schemes are the totally non parametric approach the variational calculus treatment allows , and the efficient computational procedure , where no time consuming repeated comparisons between synthetic and observational cmd are necessary , as the optimal @xmath0 is solved for directly .",
    "the lower main sequence region of the cmd diagram is totally degenerate with age , and contains the lower brightness stars , where the errors are larger .",
    "we have seen from using synthetic hr diagrams that excluding this region produces a faster and more accurate convergence of the method , and have in analyzing real galaxies excluded stars of magnitudes fainter than @xmath28 .",
    "this last cut together with the fact that our isochrones only extend out to the tip of the red giant branch ( to go further would necessitate combining results from different physical models , which we preferred not to do ) leaves us with a mass range which actually varies as a function of time .",
    "to include also the fraction of the @xmath0 outside this region , we apply a minor correction factor to the result of equation ( 4 ) , which accounts for the fraction of mass outside the sampled range , as a function of time , as given by the imf used .",
    ".age offset in gyr between simulated and recovered populations as a function of input age ( in gyr ) and metallicity ( in solar units ) , for a @xmath29 0.2 dex metallicity mismatch [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]                  the reddenings used are refined iteratively after the fitting of isochrones to the ms region .",
    "note , however , that because the reddenings are small , and the reddenings are restored to the data afterwards , even if the initial guess for the reddening is wrong by a substantial amount , very little effect is seen in the final photometry .",
    "( e.g. a change of the reddening by 0.1@xmath34 changes photometry by less than 0.005@xmath34 . )      as holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) point out , there remain some aspects of the photometric calibration of wfpc2 which are uncertain .",
    "for example , holtzman et al.(1995 ) note discrepancies of @xmath35 0.05 magnitudes between long and short exposures , which are not understood .",
    "several more minor systematic and random effects at the level of a few percent ( corresponding to a few hundredths of a magnitude ) are not well understood .",
    "furthermore , the conversion that has been made here to standard v and i colours , introduces more minor uncertainties .",
    "it must be noted that the systematic effects in zeropoints may be as large as 0.1 magnitudes .",
    "any such uncertainties appear as an offset primarily in adopted distance modulus , and would affect most cmds in the same way .",
    "differentially , any effects should be minimal ."
