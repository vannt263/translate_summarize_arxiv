    "the transmission rate of an infectious disease is the rate of which susceptible individuals become infected . in section 3.4.9 of @xcite , the authors state that  _",
    "... the direct measurement of the transmission rate is essentially impossible for most infections .",
    "but if we wish to predict the changes wrought by public health programmes , we need to know the transmission rate ... . ",
    "_ the transmission rate of many acute infectious diseases varies significantly in time and frequently exhibits significant seasonal dependence @xcite : influenza , pneumococcus , and rotavirus cases peak in winter ; rsv and measles cases peak in spring ; and polio cases peak in summer .",
    "measles outbreaks in several uk cities ( pre - vaccination ) followed a two - year cycle ( see figure 3(a)(b ) ) , and many investigators have attempted to explain this two - year cycle using mathematical models . since measles cases , as well as cases of several other childhood viral diseases such as pertussis , seem to strongly correlate with school terms and breaks , most previous modelers have assumed that the measles transmission rate can be represented by a simple sinusoidal @xcite or haar @xcite function with one - year period corresponding to the school year .",
    "this assumption is based on little empirical evidence and ignores the seasonal changes of the environment , immune system , etc . @xcite on the transmission rate .",
    "for example , since measles spreads through respiration directly or indirectly through aerosol , the high absolute humidity indoors and outdoors during winter may constrain both transmission efficiency and the virus survival rate @xcite .",
    "most investigators estimate the transmission rate of an infectious disease using the formula @xmath2 where , for instance , @xmath3 are the fractions of susceptible and infected individuals during week @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this formula requires knowledge of @xmath5 , which is usually very difficult to estimate .",
    "our new algorithm obviates this requirement .    toward obtaining our new transmission rate recovery algorithm",
    ", we first consider the simplest sir transmission model ( @xcite ) and allow the transmission rate to be a time - dependent function , _",
    "i.e. _ , there is a positive function @xmath6 such that @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the fractions of susceptible , infected , and removed individuals at time @xmath10 .",
    "we begin by asking the mathematical question :    _ given smooth infection data on time interval @xmath11 $ ] and recovery rate @xmath12 , can one always choose a transmission rate function @xmath6 such that the sir epidemic model always perfectly fits the smooth data with the given @xmath13 ?",
    "_    mathematicians call this an inverse problem .",
    "we prove that this is always possible subject to a mild restriction on the infection data and @xmath13 , and we provide an explicit formula for the solution .",
    "the construction also illustrates the danger of overfitting a transmission model where one can choose the time - dependent transmission rate .",
    "however , in practice , infection data are always discrete , not continuous .",
    "we show that one can robustly estimate @xmath6 by first smoothly interpolating the data with a spline or trigonometric function and then applying the formula to smooth data .",
    "the usual transmission rate recovery method based on ( 1 ) can be viewed as a discretization of ( 3 ) .",
    "our new method not only avoids this crude discretization , but also uses the additional information contained in ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "we extend our recovery algorithm to more general classes of transmission models including the seir epidemic model with vital rates , and we illustrate the extended algorithm using uk measles data during 1948 - 1966 . to estimate the initial transmission rate @xmath14 , we numerically examine the upper threshold of @xmath14 leading to stationary @xmath6 .",
    "when initial transmission rates are larger than this threshold , the recovered transmission rates are non - stationary functions - they exhibit an upward drift .",
    "there seems to be no public health or biological explanation for this drift .",
    "when initial transmission rates are smaller than this threshold , the recovered transmission rates are stationary functions .",
    "our recovered transmission rates exhibit two  competing \" dominant spectral peaks : at frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath15 per year , respectively . as a consistency check , our recovered @xmath6 exhibit minima in july - august during the summer school vacation : the months with the fewest number of notifications , and exhibits maxima in january or september during the first month after the winter and summer school vacations : the months with the most number of notifications .",
    "we rigorously derive a mathematical algorithm for recovering the time - dependent transmission rate from infection data .",
    "we first apply the algorithm to two simulated data sets representing two characteristic  types \" of infectious diseases .",
    "we then illustrate the algorithm using uk measles data from 1948 - 1966 .",
    "our recovery algorithm is based on a mathematical solution of an inverse problem , which is expanded in section [ appendixa ] . to recover the transmission rate @xmath6 from an infection data set",
    ", the recovery algorithm has four steps and requires two conditions .",
    ": :    smoothly interpolate the infection data with spline or trigonometric    functions to generate a smooth @xmath16 .",
    "check condition 1 :    @xmath17 , where    @xmath13 is the removal rate .",
    ": :    compute the function    @xmath18 .",
    "condition 1 prevents a zero denominator in    @xmath19 .",
    ": :    choose @xmath14 and compute the integral    @xmath20 .",
    "check    condition 2 :    @xmath21 ,    where @xmath22 is the time length of the infection data .",
    "alternatively , choose @xmath14 sufficiently small to    satisfy condition 2 .",
    ": :    apply the formula    @xmath23\\right.$ ] to compute @xmath6 on the given    interval @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "condition 1 is equivalent to @xmath25 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the time series of infection data can not decay too fast at any time .",
    "this is a mild condition that most data sets satisfy . if a data set does not satisfy this condition , we propose a scaling trick in section [ sec : discussion ] to be able to apply the algorithm .    in section [ otherextensions ] , we present extensions of the basic recovery algorithm to several popular extensions of the sir model , including the seir model with variable vital rates .",
    "our algorithm can be extended to virtually any such compartment model .",
    "we first illustrate the recovery algorithm using two simulated data sets .",
    "the functions @xmath16 and @xmath26 are the fractions of the infected population for two characteristic  types \" of infectious diseases .",
    "the first data set simulates an infectious disease with periodic outbreaks , as observed in measles ( before mass vaccination ) and cholera @xcite . the periodic function @xmath27 $ ] represents the continuous infection data , and figure 1(a ) contains plots of both @xmath16 ( solid ) and its associated transmission rate function @xmath6 ( dashed ) .",
    "the second data set simulates an infectious disease with periodic outbreaks that decays in time , as observed in influenza @xcite .",
    "the periodic function @xmath28 \\exp(-0.1 t)$ ] represents the continuous infection data , and figure 2(a ) contains plots of both @xmath26 ( solid ) and its associated transmission rate function @xmath6 ( dashed ) .",
    "we extract discrete data from functions @xmath16 and @xmath26 by sampling them at equi - spaced intervals ( see the small black squares in figure 1(a ) and figure 2(a ) ) . to each discrete time series",
    ", we apply two well - known interpolation algorithms ( trigonometric approximation and spline approximation ) @xcite .",
    "figure 1(b ) and figure 2(b ) contain plots of @xmath6 obtained from the two smooth interpolations together with the recovery algorithm .",
    "both interpolation schemes yield excellent approximations of @xmath6 in both examples .",
    "many simulations show that the recovery algorithm is robust with respect to white noise up to 10% of the data mean , as well as the number of sample points .",
    "previous studies @xcite employed the seir model with vital rates to explore the epidemic and endemic behaviors of measles infections , using the notification data in @xcite . to compare our new recovery technique with previous measles studies ,",
    "we extend our recovery algorithm to the seir model with variable vital rates ( see section [ seirpre ] ) and use the same data set . to examine the robustness of our new results , we post condition on the data to account for underreporting and reapply the extended recovery algorithm .",
    "we use the measles parameter values from @xcite : @xmath29/year@xmath30/month ( where @xmath31 is the removal period ) , @xmath32/year@xmath30/month ( where @xmath33 is the latent period ) , and @xmath34/year@xmath35/month ( death rate , equivalent to the life span of 70 years ) .",
    "public databases , such as the international infectious disease data archive @xcite and bolker s measles data archive @xcite , contain the weekly numbers of measles notifications from @xmath36 and the quarterly reported historical uk births from @xmath37 . during @xmath38 the births show large annual variations ( see figure 3(c ) ) with a strong @xmath0/year frequency component ( see figure 3(d ) ) .",
    "since some years these variations approach @xmath39 , we include actual births in our model . since neither database contains the uk birth rates from @xmath40 , this requires us to restrict our study to the period @xmath37 .",
    "although disease notification data ( the number of reported new infections during a given period ) is different from prevalence data ( the total number of reported infections during the period ) , they should be close if the reporting period is longer than the mean generation time of infection .",
    "previous measles modelers have used notification data as a surrogate for the number of infected individuals @xcite . to be able to compare our results with those of pervious authors , we first apply our recovery algorithm to the same notification data and then check the robustness of our algorithm by applying it to estimated prevalence data .",
    "we thank david earn for clarifying these issues for us .",
    "since the birth data is provided only quarterly and the notifications weekly , we smoothly interpolate the birth data and aggregate the notification data into one month intervals . to aggregate weekly infection data into monthly data , we simply sum the weekly data as previous studies @xcite . for a week across two months , this weekly infection number is separated to be two parts .",
    "for instance , if one week has three days in may and four days in june , then we multiply the notification data of this week by @xmath41 and incorporate it into may data , and we multiply the notification data of this week by @xmath42 and incorporate it into june data .",
    "previous authors represented the time - varying transmission rate using a sinusoidal or haar function , and fitted parameters using the method of least squares , without providing variances for their estimates @xcite .",
    "little empirical evidence can support their assumed functions .",
    "the school mixing assumption behind these simple transmission functions ignores many other seasonal factors such as environmental changes and immune system changes @xcite .",
    "the transmission rate has a huge variation as tested numerically and assumed in previous studies @xcite .",
    "even the ballpark range of the transmission rate function is highly uncertain @xcite , in part since it depends on guessing the size of susceptible population .",
    "our recovery algorithm provides a robust new way of estimating @xmath14 .",
    "the idea is to select the largest value of @xmath14 such that the recovered time series @xmath6 is stationary . for measles ,",
    "the upper threshold of stationary @xmath14 lies between @xmath43 and @xmath44 . if one assumes that the probability of measles transmission during an effective contact is @xmath45 @xcite , then this range of @xmath14 corresponds to an infected child having an average of about eight adequate contacts per day during january .",
    "other authors have assumed that @xmath46 ( the averaged transmission rate in january computed from their term - based step function where @xmath47 during january 1 - 6 and @xmath48 during january 7 - 31 ) @xcite , which corresponds to an infected child having about @xmath49 adequate contacts per day .",
    "early january is during the school winter break when children have far fewer contacts than during the school year .",
    "presumably most of the infected kids stayed home once they knew they were infected @xcite , and there appears to be few asymptomatic cases in children @xcite , thus we believe that the lower estimate of daily contacts provided by our algorithm seems more plausible . in figure 4(a)(c)(e)(g ) , we plot the transmission rates @xmath6 recovered from our algorithm for four different january initial values chosen to represent a wide range of @xmath14 .",
    "the recovered @xmath6 in panels ( e)(g ) are stationary , slowly increasing peaks in panel ( c ) , and fast increasing peaks in panel ( a ) .",
    "note that annual minima occur in july - august during the summer school vacation period and that annual maxima occur in january or september during the first month after the winter and summer school vacations .    in figure 4(b)(d)(f)(h ) , we plot the moduli of fourier transform of all recovered @xmath6 and observe that there are two competing dominant spectral peaks .",
    "these two dominant peaks have @xmath0 and @xmath1-year periods .",
    "the source of the three per year ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath1-year period ) peak of @xmath6 remains mysterious and does not occur in the notification time series . for stationary @xmath6",
    "( see panels ( e)(g ) ) , the one per year spectral peak is dominant ( see panels ( f)(h ) ) , and the one half per year ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath50-year period ) spectral peak is comparable to the three per year spectral peak ( see panel ( h ) ) .",
    "clearly our recovered transmission rates are much more complex functions than pure sinusoidal or haar function with one year period .    to test the robustness of our spectral peaks , we incorporate the standard correction factor of @xmath51 to account for the underreporting bias in the uk measles data ( with estimated mean reporting rate @xmath52 , note that @xmath51 is computed from @xmath53 ) @xcite .",
    "since both the removal stage in the seir model and the data notification period are one week , and the @xmath51 correction factor essentially doubles the number of cases , this corrected number of cases will account for the non - notified cases during this removal stage .",
    "hence , the corrected weekly notification data should provide a good approximation for total weekly infections .",
    "this precise methodology was used in @xcite .",
    "we plot the recovered @xmath6 with the @xmath51 correction factor and for the large range of @xmath14 in figure 5 .",
    "all the recovered @xmath6 have identical spectral peaks as those in figure 4 .",
    "thus our observation of the two spectral peaks with frequencies @xmath0/year and @xmath15/year seems robust .",
    "the scale of the infection data regulates the scale of @xmath6 but does not affect spectral peaks of fourier transform of @xmath6 .",
    "in this paper , we provide a new algorithm to recover the time - dependent transmission rate from infection data .",
    "the algorithm only requires the number of infected individuals during each time interval , and does not require the number of susceptible individuals , as does the commonly used method .",
    "we illustrate the recovery algorithm for the seir model with variable vital rates using uk measles data from 1948 to 1956 .",
    "fourier transform of our recovered transmission rate function shows dominant spectral peaks at frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath15 per year .",
    "all previous measles transmission models assumed a one - year periodic transmission rate function to account for mixing of children in school , which seems reasonable for the stationary case .",
    "however , they neglect the large three times per year cycle which can be dominant in transmission rates with fast increasing peaks",
    ". this can have profound consequences for the dynamics of the system of nonlinear odes .",
    "in addition , our recovery algorithm provides a robust new method to estimate @xmath14 which does not involve guestimating @xmath54 , and we believe that the estimate provided by our algorithm seems more plausible than existing estimates .",
    "our algorithm has some limitations to its applicability .",
    "first , the proportion of infected individuals , @xmath16 , can not decrease too fast over the full time interval of interest .",
    "in general , one can add a sufficiently large constant to @xmath16 to ensure this , but this will change the range of applicable @xmath14 , and applicability needs to be checked .",
    "second , one must assume that the proportion ( or number ) of notifications is always strictly positive .",
    "in practice this restriction can be overcome by replacing zero values in the time series with a very small positive value .",
    "third , for a chosen @xmath14 , the algorithm can only apply to a finite length of infection data .",
    "finally , one either needs to know the value of the transmission rate at some fixed time , or verify that the desired properties of @xmath6 hold for all @xmath14 in the range where the estimated @xmath6 is stationary .",
    "the algorithm should apply to the vast majority of infection data sets , and a consequence is that one can nearly always construct a time - dependent transmission rate @xmath6 such that sir model will fit the data perfectly .",
    "this illustrates a potential danger of overfitting an epidemic model with time - dependent transmission rate .",
    "[ theory2 ] given a smooth positive function @xmath16 , @xmath12 , and @xmath55 , there exists @xmath56 such that if @xmath57 there is a solution @xmath6 with @xmath58 such that @xmath59 for @xmath60 if and only if @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "the growth condition imposes no restrictions on how @xmath16 increases , but requires that @xmath16 can not decrease too quickly , in the sense that its logarithmic derivative is always bounded below by @xmath63 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath64 is a necessary condition , since equation ( [ equ2 ] ) implies that @xmath65 , which must be positive for @xmath66 .",
    "the proof of the theorem consists of showing that this condition is also sufficient .",
    "we rewrite equation ( [ equ2 ] ) as @xmath67 then compute @xmath68 , and then equate with equation ( [ equ1 ] ) to obtain @xmath69 calculating the derivative and simplifying the resulting expression yields the following bernoulli differential equation for @xmath6 @xmath70 the change of coordinates @xmath71 transforms this nonlinear ode into the linear ode @xmath72 the method of integrating factors provides the explicit solution @xmath73    a problem that could arise with this procedure is for the denominator of @xmath19 to be zero .",
    "a singular solution is prevented by requiring that the denominator be always positive , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath74 .",
