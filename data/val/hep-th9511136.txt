    "the internal structure of black holes and their final state are two intriguing problems of black hole physics . both of these problems require knowledge of physics at planckian scales for their solution .",
    "it is generally believed that only a union of quantum mechanics and gravity can provide us with a proper theory .",
    "till now such a theory , quantum gravity , has not been constructed .",
    "it seems that one can not overcome its main problem  non - renormalizability  without unifying gravity with other physical fields .",
    "superstring theory is one of the most promising approaches in this direction .",
    "but in spite of the impressive development of superstring theory we are still very far from understanding physics at planckian scales .    under these circumstances",
    "it is natural to use the following approach .",
    "one might assume that the notion of quantum average of a metric @xmath0 is still valid in the regions under consideration , and the average metric @xmath1 obeys some effective equations .",
    "we do not know these equations at the moment , but we might assume that these equations and their solutions obey some general properties and restrictions .",
    "for example , it is natural to require that the effective equations for @xmath1 in the low curvature limit reduce to the einstein equations with possible higher - curvature corrections .",
    "it is also possible to assume that the future theory of quantum gravity would solve the problem of singularities of classical general relativity .",
    "one of the possibilities is that the equations of the complete theory would simply not allow dynamically infinite growth of the curvature , so that the effective curvature @xmath2 of @xmath1 is bounded by the planckian value @xmath3 .",
    "the principle of a limiting curvature was proposed by markov @xcite .",
    "this principle excludes curvature singularity formation , so that the global properties of the solutions must change .",
    "a special form of the gravitational action for cosmological models providing the limiting curvature principle was considered in refs.@xcite .",
    "it was shown that a collapsing homogeneous isotropic universe must stop its contraction and begin expansion , while during the transition phase its evolution is described by a metric close to the de sitter one .",
    "brandenberger and mukhanov @xcite proposed a general non - linear gravitational action which allows only regular homogeneous isotropic solutions .",
    "polchinski @xcite proposed a simple realization of the limiting curvature principle by modifying the action and inserting inequality constraints into it , restricting the growth of curvature . in the case of the collapse of an inhomogeneous universe , formation of a few daughter universes",
    "can be expected @xcite .    in the application to the black - hole - interior problem",
    "the limiting - curvature principle means that the singularity which , according to the classical theory exists inside a black hole , must be removed in the complete quantum theory , so that the global structure of spacetime would be essentially modified .",
    "we can not hope to derive this result without knowledge of the theory , but we may at least discuss and classify possibilities . such a zoological approach is a natural first step and it was used in a number of publications .",
    "one of the first models of a spherically - symmetric black hole without singularities was proposed by frolov and vilkovisky @xcite . in this model",
    "the apparent horizon does not cross @xmath4 , so that @xmath4 is a regular time - like line .",
    "two cases are logically possible .",
    "( 1 ) inner and external parts of the apparent horizon remain disparate . in this case",
    "a black hole does not evaporate completely and a permanent black - hole remnant remains .",
    "( 2 ) the apparent horizon is closed . in this case , there is no event horizon ( and hence , strictly speaking no black hole ) , but practically all the observable properties of a black hole would be present until late times , when the apparent horizon disappears .",
    "this model was discussed later in refs.@xcite and , recently , both types of these singularity - free models of a black hole were used in the discussion of the final state of an evaporating black hole and information loss problem ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another logically possible singularity - free model of a black - hole interior was proposed by frolov , markov , and mukhanov @xcite . according to this model",
    ", inside a black hole there exists a closed universe instead of a singularity .",
    "the metric is obtained by gluing the schwarzschild metric to the de sitter metric through a surface @xmath5=const located inside the black hole .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is chosen in such a way that the value of a curvature calculated at @xmath6 coincides with a limiting curvature , which is assumed to be of planckian order . in this approach a fast transition between regimes",
    "is assumed and the transition region required for change of the regimes is approximated by a thin spacelike shell . in the fmm - model @xcite the spacetime passes through the deflation stage and instead of the singularity a new inflating universe is created .",
    "morgan@xcite showed that a similar result ( formation of a contracting closed de sitter - like universe with its further inflation ) , can be obtained in the framework of the polchinski approach to the limiting curvature principle .",
    "different aspects of the model of a singularity - free black hole interior with an inner de sitter like universe were also studied in@xcite .",
    "one of the assumptions of fmm and other similar models is that a phase transition to the de sitter - like phase takes place at the homogeneous spacelike surface @xmath5 .",
    "the presence of perturbations and quantum fluctuations , growing as @xmath7 , could spoil the homogeneity .",
    "the bubbles of the new de sitter - like phase could be formed independently at points separated by spacelike distances .",
    "for these reasons one could expect that different parts of a black - hole interior can create spatially disconnected worlds .",
    "the aim of this paper is to consider a simple model which could describe possible features of this process . namely we suppose that spherical bubbles of the new de sitter - like phase which are formed independently are separated from the old ( schwarzschild ) phase by relativistically moving boundaries . under this assumption",
    "one can reduce the problem to the study of the evolution of light shells representing the boundaries , and their intersection .",
    "the general theory of lightlike shells was developed by barrabes and israel@xcite ( see also@xcite ) .",
    "this approach is purely kinematic in the following sense .",
    "it allows one to take into account the conservation of energy and momenta during the process of nucleation and the further evolution of the boundaries , including possible intersection of the boundaries of two different bubbles .",
    "but it certainly does not answer questions concerning probability of bubble formation or the structure of the transition regions between phases .",
    "one of the interesting results of the model is that it does not exclude creation of a large number of new - born universes .",
    "this fact could have an interesting application to the information - loss puzzle .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains the discussion of the model and gives the conditions for the nucleation of a de sitter bubble inside a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the creation of multiple de sitter bubbles is considered in section 3 , and the interaction between the boundaries of newly created de sitter bubbles is discussed in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we discuss the possible application of the process of multiple universe formation to the information loss puzzle .",
    "finally some of the main properties of timelike and lightlike shells which are used in our model are summarized in appendix .",
    "the schwarzschild metric @xmath8 @xmath9 inside the gravitational radius ( @xmath10 ) describes the contracting homogeneous kasner - like universe with the isometry group @xmath11 .",
    "the section of fixed time @xmath12 is a homogeneous spacelike surface @xmath13 with topology @xmath14 .",
    "the square of the curvature @xmath15 .",
    "the value of the curvature @xmath2 is constant along @xmath13 and it is of order of the planckian curvature @xmath16 at @xmath17 . in the fmm - model",
    "it is assumed that as soon as the spacetime curvature reaches some critical value @xmath18 a new de sitter - like phase is formed . in the application to the unperturbed schwarzschild metric",
    "the change to a new phase occurs everywhere simultaneously ( at the spacelike surface @xmath19 ) .",
    "another assumption of the fmm - model is that the transition takes a short time , so that the transition region can be approximated by a thin shell .    for a black hole formed by the collapse of a body with small deviations from spherical symmetry",
    "the metric at a finite radius @xmath20 tends to the schwarzschild metric ( [ eq1.1 ] ) at large distance from the collapsing body@xcite . on the other hand perturbations existing in the black hole exterior and propagating inwards",
    "grow infinitely near the singularity .",
    "quantum fluctuations of metric also become important when the spacetime curvature reaches the limiting ( planckian ) value @xmath21 . the phase transition into the new de sitter - like phase happens independently in different spatially separated parts of the black hole interior .",
    "it is also plausible that due to the fluctuations of the new - phase bubble formation there is a dispersion in the times of bubble formation . under these conditions",
    "the assumption of spatial homogeneity used in the fmm - model is rather restrictive and it is necessary to consider a generalization of this model . our purpose is to generalize the fmm model to the case where the transition to the de sitter - like phase occurs independently in spatially separated regions . in order to describe the possible structure of spacetime we consider a toy model in which spherical symmetry",
    "is preserved .",
    "we assume that , near the singularity of a schwarzchild black hole , the transition to a new de sitter phase takes place at two - spheres @xmath22 .",
    "we preserve another assumption of the fmm - model , namely that the transition takes a short time and the transition region can be approximated by a thin shell . in our generalization of the fmm - model",
    "we assume that the boundary between the two phases ( schwarzschild and de sitter ) is composed of two null hypersurfaces lying to the future of @xmath22 and intersecting at @xmath22 . using this simple model",
    "we discuss different possibilities of nucleation of bubbles with de sitter - like interiors and the interaction between the newly created bubbles .",
    "lightlike shells separating two regions of a spacetime with different characteristics have proved to be a convenient way of dealing with various physical or mathematical problems in general relativity @xcite .",
    "this happens because the dynamics of lightlike shells is simple and it is directly related with geometrical properties at the junction of the two spacetime regions . a good example illustrating this is the collision of two null shells .",
    "it has been shown , first in the restricted case of spherical symmetry @xcite and later in more general situations @xcite that the geometries of the four spacetime domains bounded by the ingoing and outgoing shells are matched at the collision by only two remarkably simple algebraic relations . in the particular case of two concentric spherical shells moving radially toward each other with the velocity of light",
