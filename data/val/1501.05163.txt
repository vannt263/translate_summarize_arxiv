    "we have compared density fluctuation levels measured with a new doppler reflectometer installed in asdex upgrade and simulation results obtained with the gyrokinetic gene code .",
    "we extend the previous work by additionally presenting simulation results of density wavenumber spectra , electron temperature fluctuation levels as well as cross - phases between different quantities .",
    "one of the reasons for analyzing electron temperature fluctuation levels and cross - phases is that a new correlation electron cyclotron emission ( cece ) system is expected to be installed and to be in operation in 2015 in asdex upgrade .",

    "the asdex upgrade discharge @xmath0 analyzed in this paper was operated in the high - confinement regime ( h - mode ) .",
    "it was planned to study the turbulence characteristics in both the ion temperature gradient ( itg ) and trapped electron mode ( tem ) regimes , through a transition from one regime to another .",
    "this transition can be achieved by modifying locally the electron temperature gradient , which affects the tem instability .",
    "this is obtained by changing the electron cyclotron resonance heating power ( ecrh ) by steps during the discharge .",

    ", this case and the one without ecrh will be analyzed in detail , as examples of the two extreme cases .",
    "they correspond to the time windows shaded in grey in fig .",

    "here , @xmath21 and @xmath7 are the ion and electron temperature , respectively , and @xmath22 is the electron density .",
    "the turbulence data obtained in this paper are produced with the gyrokinetic code gene , which solves self - consistently the gyrokinetic - maxwell system of equations on a fixed grid in five dimensional phase space ( plus time ) : two velocity coordinates @xmath23 and three field - aligned coordinates @xmath24 . here , @xmath25 is the coordinate along the magnetic field line , while the radial coordinate @xmath26 and the binormal coordinate @xmath27 are orthogonal to the equilibrium magnetic field .",

    "unless stated otherwise , the magnetic equilibrium geometry is taken from the tracer - efit interface  @xcite .",

    "this is indicated by a positive frequency , which with the present normalization represents a frequency in the ion diamagnetic direction .",
    "second , for all the cases analyzed , the tem mode is stable ( studied with an eigenvalue solver ) .",

    "third , for higher wavenumbers , etg is the dominant instability ( indicated by a negative frequency ) .",
    "finally , there is practically no effect of the ecrh on the itg growth rates .",
    "the main effect of ecrh is to increase the growth rates of etg modes , possibly leading to a subsequent increase of the electron heat flux for these cases .",
    "however , in both cases , we expect their contribution to be small with respect to the itg contribution .",
    "moreover , etg modes are not expected to influence density and temperature fluctuations at low wavenumbers , which are dominated by itg . since these are the scales measured by the diagnostics we are considering here , in this work we will limit ourselves to wavenumbers up to @xmath39 , thus excluding etg modes , but allowing for a significant reduction in computational resources .",
    "physical parameters such as temperature , density , magnetic equilibrium profiles , etc . , are measured with experimental uncertainties .",
    "since these values are used as input in the gyrokinetic codes , the uncertainty in these quantities could affect the simulation results .",
    "therefore , sensitivity studies are carried out , with the aim of studying the effect of the different uncertainties on the simulation results .",
    "ideally , these studies should be done in nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations . however , due to the expensive computational effort associated , this is in practice unfeasible .",
    "for this reason , this sensitivity study is done within linear gyrokinetic simulations .",

    "the cases with ecrh produce more ion and electron heat flux than the ones without ecrh for all positions .",

    ", only the electron temperature must be increased by @xmath61 . however , for the other positions , the values of the heat fluxes obtained with the nominal parameters clearly overestimate the heat fluxes obtained with astra by a factor of @xmath62 .",

    "whilst , for the cases with ecrh heating , it has to be decreased by a maximum of @xmath64 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_heat_comp ] , only the flux - matched results are compared with the experimental heat fluxes . we can conclude that agreement of the transport levels within the errors bars can be achieved , since even small uncertainties in the temperature profile itself may translate to relatively large ones ( up to @xmath65 ) in the logarithmic gradients  @xcite .",
    "since turbulent fluxes are caused by plasma fluctuations on microscopic scales , it is necessary to validate gyrokinetic codes on a microscopic level . in this regard ,",
    "a new doppler reflectometer has been recently installed in asdex upgrade ( see ref   for more details on the diagnostic ) , which is able to measure electron density fluctuation amplitudes ( @xmath66 ) . in order to compare experimental and numerical results , a synthetic diagnostic",

    "two kinds of synthetic diagnostics can be employed .",
    "a first approach consists in simply filtering the data in order to taking into account only the location and the wavenumbers that the diagnostic measures .",
    "this translates to take into account only fluctuations at the outboard mid - plane ( @xmath67 ) , averaged over a finite radial length and then to select the range of perpendicular wavenumber that are measured in each case ( @xmath68 in gene ) .",
    "a more sophisticated method uses a full - wave code to simulate also the incidence and reflection of the wave into the gyrokinetic turbulent data  @xcite .",
    "this work is in progress and only preliminary results are available with this synthetic diagnostic ( see ref .  ) .",
    "for this reason , we have only used the filtering method for this work .",
    "comparison of the experimental and simulated @xmath66 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_spec_dens ] .",
    "the simulations that match the experimental ion heat fluxes are shown with a different marker to distinguish them from the rest .",
    "the fluctuation data is analyzed considering only perpendicular wavenumbers between @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "the experimental values are scaled by a common factor since the measurements are in arbitrary units . for this reason",
    ", only the shape of radial turbulence level profiles and the effect of ecrh can be used for comparison .",
    "we decided to scale the experimental values to try to match the case without ecrh . as is shown in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig_spec_dens ] , we obtain a remarkable agreement between experimental and simulations results in the radial trend . for the case of @xmath10 mw ecrh , there is also a good agreement in the turbulence level profile . however , with the scale used , the fluctuation levels are clearly underestimated with respect to the ones measured experimentally . in particular , the flux - matched results present the biggest discrepancy with respect to the experimental measurements .",
    "finally , from this figure we can also observe how sensitive the density fluctuations are with respect to variations in the ion logarithmic temperature gradient .",
    "for instance , a @xmath64 reduction in the logarithmic gradient can reduce density fluctuation levels by more than a factor of @xmath70 .",
    "the knowledge of the power - law spectra of a physical quantity is important for the understanding of the underlying physics and useful for providing constraints for simple physical models .",
    "based on kolmogorov - type arguments  @xcite , turbulence is generally associated with universal power - law spectra . however , as shown in refs  , this is generally not the case in plasma turbulence , and different power - law spectra indices can be found depending on the type of mechanism which drives or dissipates energy in the system .",
    "furthermore , the knowledge of wavenumber spectra could be important for a clear identification of the turbulent regimes driven by different microinstabilities and can be used to further validation of the gyrokinetic model .",
    "the results of the electron density fluctuation spectra at @xmath71 for different logarithmic ion temperature gradients are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_spec_dens_1 ] .",
    "the solid lines represent the wavenumber range where a fit to a power law is shown : @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the spectral index , and @xmath74 represents an average over all the coordinates except @xmath75 .",

    "the calculated spectral indices are also shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_spec_dens_2 ] and  [ fig_spec_dens_3 ] with respect to the ion temperature gradient and to the radial position , respectively .",
    "these figures present a clear qualitative behavior : the spectral index decreases with the increase of turbulence drive .",
    "additionally , the spectral indices also decrease when going from the inner to the outer core position .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the exponents cover a wide range of values , approximately from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "although density fluctuation spectra were not measured with the doppler reflectometer for this discharge , a similar trend has been also reported in ref .   for various asdex upgrade discharges .",
    "these results indicate that the turbulence driven by itg modes exhibits non - universal power laws , whose spectral indices could depend on several physical parameters .",
    "future work in this respect will be to study also if tem modes exhibit similar properties .",
    "if this was the case , then it would become very difficult to distinguish a type of instability by measuring only its characteristic spectral index .      at the time the discharge was performed ,",
    "no temperature fluctuation measurements were available .",
    "however , a correlation electron cyclotron emission ( cece ) diagnostic is currently installed on asdex upgrade , and electron temperature fluctuation profiles will be available in the future campaigns .",
    "the cece diagnostic measures perpendicular electron temperature fluctuations ( @xmath78 ) in the long wavelength range ( relevant for itg and tem modes ) and is not sensitive short wavelengths ( etg modes ) .",
    "this diagnostic presents an inherent limitation in the lowest fluctuation level that can be detected .",
    "this noise level depends on the physical parameters of the discharge , but typical values are between @xmath79  @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of cece modeling in diii - d is given in ref .  .",
    "this synthetic diagnostic has already been implemented in gene for diii - d discharges  @xcite and a similar synthetic diagnostic will be implemented for asdex upgrade discharges .",
    "however , this diagnostic could be not used in this work since it requires the knowledge of the cece configuration during the discharge .",
    "for this reason , we have considered a simpler synthetic diagnostic , which consists in filtering the gyrokinetic data to the positions and wavenumbers that are expected to be measured in asdex upgrade .",
    "consequently , the gyrokinetic data analysis results are restricted to the outboard mid - plane position ( @xmath67 ) , averaged over the finite radial length and summing all perpendicular wavenumbers ( since short wavelengths are not simulated ) . in order to better model the actual diagnostic",
    ", one should also apply a filter in the frequency space .",
    "however , this filter will also depend on the specific range of frequencies measured .",
    "since we do not have access to this information , we have considered all the frequencies in the analysis .",
    "therefore , the following results should be only used as an approximated indication of the fluctuation amplitudes that could be detected with cece for this discharge .",
    "nevertheless , we do not expect radial trends to change with respect to a more sophisticated synthetic diagnostic approach and only the amplitudes are likely to be rescaled  @xcite .",
    "the main results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fluc_temp ] .",
    "the perpendicular electron temperature fluctuation amplitudes go from a minimum of @xmath80 at the inner position to a maximum of @xmath81 at the outer core position . therefore , assuming a noise - level in the order of @xmath82 for the cece diagnostic , this could imply that only the fluctuations at the outer core positions ( starting from @xmath83 ) could be detected .",
    "as for the case of the density amplitudes , we also observe a large variation of the fluctuation amplitudes with respect to the changes in the logarithmic ion temperature gradient .",
    "doppler reflectometers can be coupled to the cece diagnostics to calculate cross - phases between electron density and temperature fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "this measurement is important for gyrokinetic validation studies since it represents a relationship between different fluctuating quantities ( density and temperature in this case ) .",
    "in addition , this cross - phase could be also related to the cross - phase that determines the turbulent heat fluxes ( electrostatic potential and temperature fluctuations ) .",
    "for this reason , in addition to the cross - phase that can be measured experimentally , we will also show the cross - phase between electrostatic potential and electron density fluctuations , so we can relate the cross - phases measured experimentally to the turbulent heat fluxes .",
    "the cross - phases are here defined as @xmath84 , and , @xmath85 .    fig .",
    "[ fig_cross_2 ] shows the variation of the cross - phase versus the ion temperature gradient integrated over binormal wavenumbers in the range of @xmath86 . for most of the cases ,",
    "the phases remain rather invariant with respect to the variation of this parameter .",
    "therefore , this result seems to indicate that the cross - phase is a better observable to identify the type of instability which drives the turbulence in experiments , since tem instability is expected to exhibit different cross - phases  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_cross_3 ] , the cross - phase are displayed versus the radial positions . regarding the cross - phase between density and electrostatic potential fluctuations ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", we see that they are practically in phase , i.e. close to @xmath87 .",
    "in addition , an increase of the phase with the radial position is also observed , going from practically @xmath87 degrees at @xmath88 to approximate by @xmath89 degrees at the outer core position . on the contrary , for the cross - phase between electron density and temperature fluctuations ( c ) and ( d )",
    ", we see a decrease with the radial position , going from around @xmath90 degrees in the inner position to a value of @xmath91 degrees , which result in an increase of the electron heat flux .",
    "similar values of this cross - phase have also been measured in diii - d and calculated with gyro in ref .  .",
    "furthermore , these values have also been found by gene for these discharges , see ref .  .",
    "these observations could be explained in the following way . in the inner position ,",
    "the population of the trapped particles that contributes to the itg instability is small , so the electrons behave almost adiabatically . because of this , density and potential fluctuations are in phase and density and perpendicular temperature fluctuations are almost out of phase ( i.e. , close to @xmath91 degrees ) , thus producing negligible electron heat flux . with increasing the radial position ,",
    "the population of trapped particles increase and a deviation of the electron adiabaticity is observed . for this reasons , both cross - phases approach to @xmath91 degrees , with the subsequent increase of electron heat flux .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig_cross ] , the colored contours display the cross - phases obtained from the nonlinear simulations , while the red squares are used to display the cross - phases of the linear simulations for the case without ecrh at @xmath92 .",
    "the agreement between linear and nonlinear cross - phases is remarkably good .",
    "this is also observed for the other cases  @xcite .",
    "this result implies that linear simulations could be enough to compare with experimental results .",

    "[ fig_variation ] . here",
    ", we show the impact of the variation of the logarithmic ion temperature gradient around the nominal value on various observables .",
    "ion and electron heat fluxes ( a ) , electron and temperature fluctuation amplitudes ( b ) and electron density spectral indices ( c ) are all very sensitive with respect to small changes in the ion logarithmic temperature gradient .",

    "this result implies that the comparison of gyrokinetic simulation and experimental measurements for these observables are very sensitive to uncertainties in the experimental input profiles . on the contrary ,",
    "cross - phases between density and temperature fluctuations and between density and electrostatic potential ( d ) are rather insensitive with respect to @xmath41 .",
    "this , together with the fact that linear and nonlinear cross - phases agreed also remarkably well , indicates that cross - phases could be a good observable to compare ( fast ) linear gyrokinetic simulations with experimental measurements .",
    "we have analyzed , by means of gyrokinetic simulations with gene , core turbulence features of an h - mode discharge in asdex upgrade .",
    "the main results of this paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "flux - matched simulations were achieved by varying the nominal ion temperature gradient by a factor of @xmath94 , which is within the uncertainty range of the experimental profiles .",
    "in addition , density fluctuation levels show an agreement in the shape of the radial turbulence level profiles , although the effect of the ecrh on the fluctuation levels was not reproduced .",
    "non - universal power - law spectra were found for turbulence driven by itg modes .",
    "in particular , itg instability exhibits spectral indices for the density fluctuation spectra which cover a broad range of values .",
    "these values depend on the radial position and also on the specific ion temperature gradient .",
    "gyrokinetic simulations predict a decrease of the exponents with respect to both the increase of the ion temperature gradient and the increase of the radial position .",
    "these results could help validate future analytical theories and are useful for comparisons with other gyrokinetic codes and future measurements .",
    "regarding the electron temperature fluctuations , we observe for the inner position ( @xmath92 ) fluctuation amplitudes which are close to the sensitivity of the cece diagnostic .",
    "therefore , it is possible that only measurements at positions larger than @xmath95 could be detected with this diagnostic in such discharges .",
    "we hope that these results can provide guidance for the development of the cece diagnostic that is currently being installed in asdex upgrade .",
    "finally , by analyzing cross - phases between density and temperature fluctuations and between density and electrostatic potential , we observed that linear and nonlinear cross - phases agree remarkably well , and that they are rather insensitive with respect to the variation of the ion temperature gradient , indicating that cross - phases could be a good observable with experimental measurements for comparisons .    for future work , gene and asdex upgrade comparisons will continue with the study of similar h - modes plasmas but with higher ecrh power ( up to @xmath96 mw ) .",
    "these discharges are expected to have peaked electron temperature profiles and allow tem modes to be dominant .",

    "<S> gyrokinetic validation studies are crucial in developing confidence in the model incorporated in numerical simulations and thus improving their predictive capabilities . as one step in this direction </S>",
    "<S> , we simulate an asdex upgrade discharge with the gene code , and analyze various fluctuating quantities and compare them to experimental measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the approach taken is the following . </S>",
    "<S> first , linear simulations are performed in order to determine the turbulence regime . </S>",
    "<S> second , the heat fluxes in nonlinear simulations are matched to experimental fluxes by varying the logarithmic ion temperature gradient within the expected experimental error bars . finally , the dependence of various quantities with respect to the ion temperature gradient is analyzed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that density and temperature fluctuations can vary significantly with small changes in this parameter , thus making comparisons with experiments very sensitive to uncertainties in the experimental profiles </S>",
    "<S> . however , cross - phases are more robust , indicating that they are better observables for comparisons between gyrokinetic simulations and experimental measurements . </S>"
