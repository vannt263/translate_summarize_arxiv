    "the bloch oscillating transistor ( bot ) @xcite@xmath0@xcite is a device based on tuning the probability of interlevel switching in a mesoscopic josephson junction  ( jj ) .",

    "the current @xmath1 at the collector(c ) -emitter(e ) -circuit is controlled by the base current @xmath2 leading to transistor - like operation .",

    "is connected to the base electrode b and load @xmath3 to the collector electrode c. the lead capacitances from the electrodes to the ground are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the bot itself consists of  a josephson junction ( jj ) between the emitter electrode e and the superconducting  island  , normal tunnel junction between b and the island and large @xmath6 resistor between c and the island .",

    "( quasi)charge @xmath7 is shown in fig .",
    "1(b)@xcite , where also the transitions are illustrated .",
    "it is assumed that the josephson coupling energy @xmath8 is smaller or of the same order as the charging energy @xmath9 and that @xmath10 .",
    "here @xmath11 is the total capacitance of the island , @xmath12 is the collector resistor , and @xmath13and @xmath14 are the tunnel resistances of the two junctions . the quantum resistance @xmath15 k@xmath16 .",
    "when c is biased at a point , where @xmath17 , the charge tends to relax through the collector resistor @xmath18 towards @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the collector voltage . at @xmath21",
    "it is likely that a cooper pair ( cp ) tunneling through the jj returns the island back to @xmath22 .",
    "repeating this cycle , the bloch oscillation@xcite , leads to a net current through the ce - circuit .",
    "a competing process is the zener tunneling@xcite , which takes the system to the upper bands ( @xmath23 in the extended band picture we are using ) .",
    "there the cooper pair tunneling is blocked .",
    "one or more quasiparticles tunneling through the base junction may return the system back to the lowest energy band i.e. back to @xmath24 .    the zener tunneling probability between bands @xmath25 and @xmath26 is given as @xmath27 . in the limit of small @xmath8 it approaches unity very rapidly as @xmath25 increases .",
    "therefore we can neglect cooper pair tunneling at higher bands , and consider the device as a two - level system .",
    "below we will call the lowest band with @xmath28 the  first level  and higher bands with @xmath29 the  second level  .",
    "tunneling events , which cause transitions between the levels will be called interlevel transitions ( or upwards and downwards transitions ) and those , which cause transitions between higher bands , will be called intralevel transitions . controlling the probability of downwards transitions leads to control of average @xmath1 and thus to transistor - like characteristics .",
    "the bot was recently experimentally realized @xcite , and simulations showed that its properties can be quantitatively predicted with a computational model @xcite .",
    "it is potentially useful in cryogenic applications such as readout circuits of radiation detectors , or measurement of small currents in quantum metrology .",
    "the aim of this article is to gain more insight into the dynamics of the bot  and to find the noise properties . to be able to do so",
    ", we derive an analytic theory , and study its applicability by comparing the results to computational data . small - signal parameters of bot  as well as equivalent noise sources and the noise temperature are derived .",
    "since we assume that @xmath8 @xmath30 we can interpret the quasicharge as the real charge , and the energy diagram will reduce to the simple parabola ( dashed line in fig . 1b ) .",
    "we can account for the josephson coupling perturbatively and calculate the cp tunneling probabilities using the @xmath31-theory @xcite .",
    "this takes the electromagnetic environment into account .",
    "the consequence is that the tunneling does not happen strictly at @xmath21 , but is rather represented with a finite distribution@xcite .",
    "the simulation is done by integrating @xmath7 in the time domain .",
    "the charge @xmath32 becomes @xmath33    where the first term is the collector current , the second and the third terms describe quasiparticle tunneling through the two junctions and the last term describes the cooper pair tunneling through the josephson junction .",

    "the voltage @xmath34 is across the jj .",
    "the charges and voltages across both junctions , @xmath35 ( base junction ) and @xmath36 ( jj )  needed for the tunneling rate computation below are obtained as follows : @xmath37    the voltages across  the junctions are @xmath38 . in numerical simulations",

    "the prefactor 2 instead of more familiar @xmath220 is due to the random length of charge pulses as opposed to standard shot noise . with large @xmath221 , or with long cooper pair sequences ,",
    "the noise drops .",
    "the impedance also increases because single electron tunneling is forbidden during the bloch oscillations .",
    "one should remember , however , that this is strictly true only in the absence of base junction leakage current .    lowering the equivalent current noise below the input current shot noise level",

    "the equivalent noise at the input is then @xmath225 . using @xmath226",
    "we then get @xmath227 .",

    "therefore the equivalent noise  at the input must be smaller .",
    "schematically as function of time , when bot is operated in the limit , where @xmath230 in ( a ) @xmath231 and ( b ) @xmath232 .",
    "the gray - shaded regions represent cooper - pair sequences with area @xmath233.,width=226 ]    as noted above , the spectral noise density of the backaction noise current ( @xmath202 in fig .",

    "it can be shown , that for either @xmath235 or @xmath236 , it is exactly  that of the base current shot noise , i.e. @xmath237 . the maximum suppression of @xmath238 occurs at @xmath239 , where the fano factor is @xmath240 .",
    "the reason for the difference in the equivalent current noise and the backaction noise is , that in the limit of large @xmath241 the output current noise becomes fully anticorrelated with @xmath202 .",
    "thus @xmath202 does not directly determine the current resolution , or vice versa . to minimize the backaction noise",

    "one should also remember that the fluctuation effects mentioned in section iv and ref .",
    "@xcite tend to suppress the gain which also increases the equivalent noise .",
    "also the assumption @xmath245 has to remain valid for the model to work .    if the approximation from eqs . ( [ ne3 ] ) and ( [ gdown3 ] ) is used instead of eqs .",
    "( [ ne1 ] ) and ( [ gdown2 ] ) for calculating @xmath84 and @xmath88 , the dominating terms are in many cases those dependent on @xmath178 especially if @xmath180 . in appendix",

    "approximations for @xmath150 , @xmath84 , @xmath186 , @xmath175 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 are made by eliminating the bias parameters at an interesting point of operation . ",

    "however , the trade - off is that the optimum impedance @xmath206 also diverges .",

    "with very large @xmath178 the main effect of increasing @xmath45 is increasing the number of electrons @xmath88 needed to cause a downwards transition ( see eq .",

    "i.e. @xmath180 , the input conductance is close to zero .",
    "the effect is that a small change in @xmath2 causes a large change in @xmath45 .",

    "this leads to the enhancement of the current gain .    a set of simulated @xmath145 and @xmath262-plots with a varying josephson coupling",

    "the simulated iv curves become hysteretic at @xmath265 according to eq .",

    "we will next illustrate the trade - offs and test the validity of eqs .",

    "one can see , that the dependence @xmath270 is correctly reproduced regardless of parameters , i.e. the property is quite generic .",
    "the current noise and the minimum noise temperature are shown as the function of the optimum resistance in fig .",
    "the computational noise data was obtained by performing a fast fourier transform for the output current and averaging the low - frequency part , which gives @xmath271 . to further evaluate @xmath200 , @xmath206 and @xmath207 , eqs .",

    "( [ roptap3 ] ) and ( [ tnap3 ] ) .",
    "differences in absolute levels can partially be explained through the inaccuracy of the numeric constants due to approximations made in appendix a. to some extent the differences can also be understood with reference to excess noise mechanisms discussed in section vii .",

    ".     referred to input and ( b )  the minimum noise temperature @xmath207 as function of @xmath206 . the device and bias parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "we have developed an analytic theory to predict characteristic curves and noise properties of the bloch oscillating transistor .",
    "even though it was derived at zero temperature , comparison to simulations at finite temperatures showed reasonable agreement .",
    "the reason is that the main fluctuation mechanism , the two - level switching noise , is essentially temperature independent . of other noise sources , for example ,",
    "the thermal noise of the base junction is insignificant , since the junction is at a typical point of operation biased at @xmath275 .",
    "two modes of operation were discussed .",
    "the small signal and noise parameters in both limits were obtained , i.e. eqs .",
    "( [ betaap1])-([tnap1 ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ betaap3])-([tnap3 ] ) . in the first mode the device acts as a simple @xmath276 charge multiplier . in the second mode intralevel transitions play an important role .",
    "the consequence is the emergence of the hysteresis parameter @xmath178 .",
    "this was found to have a drastic effect on device properties .",
    "it was shown that noise currents below 1 fa and noise temperatures below 100 mk can be obtained for optimum impedances of order a few m@xmath16 .",
    "an additional noise mechanism is the shot - noise of the leakage current from the base - electrode . at a finite temperature also the bandwidth of the bloch - oscillation increases@xcite , and thus the shot - noise of the cooper pairs",
    "adds to the total noise .",
    "this may explain the factor of about 3 increase in noise temperature as temperature is changed from 20 mk to 300 mk in fig .",
    "these effects appear at the output of the amplifier .",
    "thus they add to the total output noise being additional terms to eq .",
    "( [ sout ] ) . even in the presence of them",
    "the main conclusions of this article remain valid .",
    "we have also assumed arbitrarily large @xmath4 , which is acceptable in low - frequency applications .",
    "however , if one wishes to increase the band , @xmath4 should be decreased .",
    "the first effect of finite @xmath4 is that the base voltage starts to fluctuate at frequencies typical to bot  dynamics .",
    "most other well - known mesoscopic amplifiers , e.g. single - electron transistor ( set ) @xcite or single cooper pair transistor ( scpt ) @xcite are based on controlling current flow by charging a gate electrode .",
    "this is similar to the field effect transistor ( fet ) , whereas bot  resembles a bipolar junction transistor ( bjt )  in the sense that a small base current is used to control a larger collector current .",
    "however , there are also important differences as well .",
    "for example , we have shown that the equivalent current noise of bot  can be brought below the shot noise of the input current .",
    "the reason is , that in bot  the noise at the output is partially correlated to the noise at the input .",
    "the @xmath277-noise of the bot  is not addressed in this paper .",
    "however , as opposed to gate - controlled devices , the bot is immune to background charge fluctuations .",
    "it is probable that the main @xmath277-noise mechanism is the fluctuation of the josephson coupling . due to symmetry considerations",
    ", it can be reduced by using bias reversal techniques typically used with a dc squid ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ authors wish to acknowledge fruitful discussions with p. hakonen and r. lindell .",
    "the work was supported by the academy of finland ( project 103948 ) .",
    "in this appendix we show the derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ betabappr])-([tnap3 ] ) .",
    "the aim is to derive an approximation , which applies at @xmath180 and @xmath120 .",
    "the main task is to get sufficient estimates for @xmath278 @xmath279 , @xmath150 , @xmath88 , @xmath280 and @xmath281 near an interesting point of operation .",

    "( [ ne3 ] ) and ( [ gdown3 ] ) used for @xmath88 and @xmath84 to apply the collector voltage must satisfy @xmath167 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath282 .",
    "when the system is at the second level , the voltage across the jj is @xmath283 and the collector current consists of the leakage current only , i.e. @xmath284 .",
    "assuming that @xmath285 and that the base junction roughly acts as a linear resistor we get by analyzing the circuit of fig .",
    "1(a ) and noting that by definition @xmath286 the result @xmath287 , i.e. we have found estimates for the bias parameters . using these and eqs . ( [ is ] ) , ( [ gup ] ) and",
