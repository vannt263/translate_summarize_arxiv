    "not only are interacting binary stars responsible for numerous important stellar phenomena , but understanding the effect of binaries on stellar populations is also important for correctly interpreting the integrated light of stellar populations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the internal structure of the milky way ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "natural differences in binary - star features may also have been misinterpreted as variations in the stellar initial mass function @xcite .",
    "the initial properties of binary stars are also a clue to understanding the star formation process ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , our knowledge of stellar binarity is far from perfect .",
    "regulus ( @xmath8 leonis ) is one of the brightest stars in the sky , but was only recently discovered to be in a binary system with a @xmath9 40 day orbital period @xcite . given that the nature of this extremely well - studied star was unknown for so long , our detailed knowledge of stellar binarity in general seems likely to be highly incomplete .",
    "prior studies have nonetheless convincingly found that being single is the exception rather than the norm for massive stars .",
    "for example , @xcite concluded that less than a third of o - type primary stars will evolve as if they were single .",
    "@xcite concluded that the average multiplicity of o - type stars is _ more than _ 2 , i.e.  even binaries have _ lower _ multiplicity than the expectation value for an o - star .",
    "it is generally accepted that the binary fraction drops with decreasing stellar mass ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , that measures of the present - day binarity in samples of later spectral - type stars are only an indirect measure of the initial binarity of those stars . inferring the initial properties from the present - day population is a hard problem , given the many ways in which binary systems can evolve .",
    "there is some indication that apparent binarity decreases with age ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and the distribution of binary periods and mass - ratios should also be expected to change as binaries interact through their lifetimes .    despite the results described above",
    ", our knowledge of stellar binarity still contains many unknowns ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "large spectroscopic surveys provide a powerful way to investigate the binarity of galactic stars , since multi - epoch spectroscopy allows binaries to be detected via radial velocity ( rv ) variations .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has already been used for this purpose ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "over the next few years the guoshoujing telescope will survey the stellar population of the galaxy , providing spectra for more than five millions galactic stars , including many with multiple observations .",
    "this work was begun to investigate the power of the existing lamost and sdss observations to examine stellar binarity .",
    "the first official lamost data release ( dr1 ) contains data from both the pilot @xcite and regular surveys until 2013 june .",
    "it contains one million stellar spectra and their derived physical parameters ( rv , effective temperature @xmath10 , surface gravity @xmath11 , and metallicity @xmath2}$ ] ) .",
    "the observed and released data include galactic anti - center area @xcite .",
    "we also employ data from the sdss dr9 @xcite , which includes spectra taken over 14,555 deg@xmath12 of the sky and data from the segue project .",
    "binaries complicate the use of stars as tracers of galaxy evolution , and galaxy structure and evolution may in turn complicate the interpretation of observed differences in stellar populations . in particular , when comparing galactic samples of present - day stars with different metallicities , it may be significant that the different - metallicity samples are drawn from different parts of the milky way s structure .",
    "for example , different formation scenarios for the galactic thin and thick disks might affect the present - day binarity of the stars in those populations as much as the differences in age and metallicity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    to simplify the language",
    ", this work generally refers to a `` binary fraction '' ( denoted @xmath13 ) .",
    "however , this only represents the fraction of primary stars which have a binary companion with an orbital period that leads to rv variations which we can detect , not the overall fraction of stellar systems which are binaries .",
    "this is also not the same as the fraction of stars which are in a binary system .",
    "our analysis method is presented in section [ sec : method ] .",
    "the sdss and lamost samples and our analysis are described in section [ sec : data ] , with our conclusions discussed in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "binaries can be detected by comparing the rvs obtained from two epochs for the same stars . however",
    ", rv differences may also occur simply due to uncertainty in the two measurements .",
    "therefore , the probability of the difference of rvs from two epochs , @xmath14 , for a group of stars is contributed by both the motion within binaries and the uncertainty of the velocity measurement : @xmath15 where @xmath13 is the binary fraction of the sample of stars , and the mean measurement error is @xmath16 .",
    "the probability of observing @xmath17 for binary stars is @xmath18 , given a time separation @xmath19 between the two observations and a binary dynamical model @xmath20 .",
    "the probability of observing a given @xmath17 for a single star , @xmath21 , depends only on the measurement error .",
    "clearly @xmath22 depends on the assumed dynamical model for the binary population .",
    "we assume that : ( 1 ) the observed stars with companions are on the main sequence , with masses drawn from the salpeter imf @xcite ; ( 2 ) the mass ratio follows a uniform distribution between 0.05 and 1 ; ( 3 ) the orbit of each binary is circular ( @xmath23 ) , with the orbital periods following the log - normal distribution given by @xcite ; ( 4 ) we consider random orientation of the systems in 3d space and for the initial orbital phases @xmath24 .    with the above assumptions , a random @xmath17 can be calculated from the model by drawing an orbital period , the stellar mass of the primary , a mass ratio , an orientation , and an initial phase from their corresponding distributions given a fixed @xmath19 . for a sample of stars with two - epoch rv measurements , one can then estimate @xmath13 and @xmath16 using a maximum - likelihood method based on equation [ eq1 ] .",
    "since we know that our assumption of zero eccentricity is wrong for real binaries , we tested how much non - zero eccentricities affect our determination of @xmath13 .",
    "figure [ sim ] shows that our ability to recover the true @xmath13 for artificial samples with @xmath25 and @xmath26 is worse than for @xmath23 , although the results are generally consistent .",
    "the largest potential bias this reveals is that , with @xmath25 , we underestimate the binary fraction for @xmath27 .",
    "while we consider that this effect does not affect our qualitative conclusions , the additional uncertainty should not be forgotten .    in practice",
    ", we can not detect binaries for which the orbital period is so long that the velocity difference over time @xmath19 is dominated by the measurement error in the velocities .",
    "this effectively truncates the orbital period distribution at @xmath28 , which is a parameter we must estimate .",
    "the mock sample is created with a known @xmath13 , i.e.,80% and maximum period of @xmath29 days .",
    "figure [ sim ] shows results using simulated data , the real @xmath19 distribution for our lamost sample and @xmath30 .",
    "( for both lamost and sdss , @xmath19 is typically less than 300 days and the rv measurement error is @xmath31 . )",
    "based on these calculations we chose @xmath32 days , above which our detection efficiency begins to decrease .",
    "we excluded data with @xmath33 day and galactic latitude @xmath34 due to extinction .",
    "the time gap distribution is shown as the left upper panel of figure [ fb ] .",
    "the sample was cross matched with @xmath35 photometry from the 2mass catalog @xcite , and extinction correction was performed using the schlegel dust map @xcite .",
    "we select f / g dwarf stars using the condition @xmath36 , such that the distance and the mass of each star could be obtained from the pipeline . from this procedure",
    ", we obtained a sample of 5204 f / g stars with @xmath17 measurements .",

    "the weight @xmath37 is defined following the method of @xcite . using methods described in section 2 , the lamost data produced the results shown in figure [ fb ] . from lamost sample , we infer that @xmath38 of f / g primary stars have a binary companion and an orbital period in the range to which we are sensitive .",
    "the marginalized distributions are used to estimate the dispersions of parameter estimations in results for @xmath13 and @xmath16 , giving @xmath39 and error @xmath40 @xmath41 .",

    "we divided the primary stars from the legue and segue samples into sub - samples based on @xmath10 . for each bin of @xmath10",
    "we re - calculated @xmath13 . between 4000 and 7500 k",
    ", @xmath13 changes significantly , as shown in figure [ teffbin ] .",
    "the inferred rv errors vary from 2 to 5 @xmath41 .",
    "the rv errors change with the stellar spectral types due to the changing availability of spectral lines .",
    "the stars with a @xmath10 of @xmath48 k have the best rv measurements .",
    "three sub - samples from our selected lamost stars are shown in figure [ teffbin ] .",
    "as shown in figure [ teffbin ] , we find a higher value of @xmath13 for hotter stars .",
    "this trend has previously been identified ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also selected three sub - samples with different @xmath2}$ ] from the segue sample of f / g stars ( i.e. ,  over a limited range of @xmath10 , as shown in figure [ dis ] ) , and then re - calculated figure [ fb ] for those @xmath2}$ ] groups ( with metal - poor defined such that @xmath2}<-1.1 $ ] ; moderate - metallicity with @xmath49}<-0.6 $ ] ; and metal - rich stars with @xmath2}>-0.6 $ ] ) .",

    "one possibility was that this result might have been an artifact of sample selection , e.g. , because the different @xmath2}$ ] samples contain different fractions from each spectral type .",
    "hence , we calculated normalized star count in each spectral type bin for each @xmath2}$ ] subsample ( as shown in the last panel of figure 2 ) .",
    "these star counts display similar changes with spectral type , which does not show the apparent @xmath2}$ ] effect .",
    "hence this systematic change in @xmath13 with @xmath2}$ ] is not a result of the change with spectral type combined with sample selection , but a genuine separate systematic effect .",

    "we have inferred the fraction , @xmath13 , of stars with a binary companion in an orbit with a period less than roughly 1000 days .",
    "our results reproduce the qualitatively expected decrease in binary fraction with decreasing @xmath10 of the primary star . at the same time",
    ", we have estimated the intrinsic rv error for lamost .",
    "our result ( @xmath57 ) is somewhat smaller than the `` error '' given in the lamost dr1 catalogue , which was an obvious overestimate .",
    "the lamost technical department are currently preparing more reliable error determinations .",
    "the absolute values we infer for @xmath13 are very likely sensitive to whether our assumed period distribution accurately represents the real period distribution in the period range to which we are sensitive .",
    "we have also simply assumed that the binary orbits are circular , as discussed and tested in section [ sec : method ] , which may well limit our accuracy .",
    "when more rv epochs are available for more systems then we should be able to constrain the form of the eccentricity and period distributions whilst finding @xmath13 ( as achieved for massive stars by @xcite ) , rather than assuming a distribution . nonetheless , the relative changes which we find in @xmath13 do indicate that either @xmath13 or the properties of the orbital distributions are changing as a function of spectral type .",
    "our most striking result is the change of @xmath13 with @xmath2}$ ] . for the sdss segue samples containing metal - poor and metal - medium stars",
    "we find a substantially higher value of @xmath13 ( @xmath52 ) than in the metal - rich sample ( @xmath38 ) . to our knowledge , this is the first time that such a strong metallicity - dependence in binary populations has been detected , whatever the effect is purely due to a systematic change in @xmath13 or to some other aspect of the orbital distributions .",
    "this observational difference has several possible interpretations , partly since we are not sensitive to the overall binary fraction but only to binaries with present - day orbital periods less than 1000 days .",
    "furthermore , the population ages are very likely to be different between the samples . assuming that the metal - rich sample contains the youngest stars , potential explanations include :",
    "* the formation of metal - rich stars might generally lead to an intrinsically lower binary fraction , or to systematically wider binaries .",
    "the stellar imf may be built up as a consequence of dynamical interactions between protostars ( for which see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; some of these models predict that binaries are more commonly produced in gas - rich environments @xcite .",
    "if the gas fraction during the star formation epoch decreases with increasing @xmath2}$ ] , which seems plausible , then this prediction would be consistent with our results .",
    "if so , then we have detected an imprint of the star formation process . *",
    "the samples might have had identical initial binary fractions . over time",
    ", interactions may harden some of the initially wide binaries , reducing their separation and orbital period and therefore increasing the fraction of the binaries which we can detect . assuming the high @xmath2}$ ] sample is the younger one , the lower @xmath2}$ ] samples would have had longer for such interactions to occur . *",
    "even if the samples had identical initial binary fractions _ and _ ages , the different @xmath2}$ ] might have led to different present - day period distributions , i.e. , @xmath2}$ ] might alter the outcome of the binary interactions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . * in the older samples , many of the primary stars we detect could once have been secondary stars , i.e. ,  were companions to more massive stars which have now become a low - luminosity , compact remnant .",
    "those f / g / k secondary stars would not be detected as f / g / k stars in the younger population , and would hence not be included in our sample , since the light from the system would be dominated by the more massive primary . *",
    "the specific formation environments of these particular milky way stellar populations may have led to systematically different binary fractions or binary period distributions as a function of @xmath2}$ ] .",
    "this would suggest that the type of star formation which led to the milky way thick disk and halo is different to the style of star formation which produces thin disk stars . in turn",
    "this would indicate that the thick disk has not been formed by radial migration of stars from the thin disk .",
    "other argument have previously been used to suggest that the thick disk was not formed by migration of thin disk stars @xcite , so we note that the chain of logic is not reversible ( i.e. ,  this conclusion about the structure of the galaxy would not imply that this is the correct explanation for the apparent difference in binary fractions ) .",
    "the lamost sample contains data from stars which were observed in the nearby galactic thin disk , i.e. stars with @xmath2}$ ] similar to those of the metal - rich stars selected from the sdss sample ( @xmath2}>-0.6 $ ] ) .",
    "hence the @xmath13 inferred from lamost dr1 is consistent with the sdss result .",
    "future lamost observations should enable us to study the binary fractions in more detail .",
    "we suggest that the future lamost selection function should be considered with this aim in mind .",
    "future measurements of @xmath58}$ ] for the stars would also be helpful .    moreover",
    " _ whatever _ the origin of this population variation  studies of internal galaxy kinematics , galaxy structure and evolution should be careful not to assume that the close binary fraction does not change as a systematic function of @xmath2}$ ] .",
