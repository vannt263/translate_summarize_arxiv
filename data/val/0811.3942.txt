    "for instance , -shaped radio sources are known to have radio luminosities near the fanaroff - riley ( fr ) type i / ii divide @xcite , and their morphologies suggest that these may be the long sought - after transition sources ( paper i ) . to evaluate this interesting scenario ,",
    "an important first step is to place the -shaped sources in the owen - ledlow @xcite plane ( radio luminosity versus host galaxy absolute magnitude ) .    as part of our -shaped source study ,",

    "we also observed j1357 + 4807 , which was identified in paper  i as an -shaped radio source from a published map but previously was without a spectroscopic identification @xcite .",
    "its redshift of @xmath17 was reported in paper  i , and the spectrum is now presented here . similarly , in the case of the first -shaped radio source candidate j0702 + 5002 ( catalog @xmath1314 in paper  i ) , we reported @xmath18 in paper  i , and the spectrum is presented here .",

    "our redshift of @xmath21 for j1253 + 3435 ( tons12@xmath22301 , catalog @xmath1359 ) is based on the detected emission lines from [ o iii ] @xmath235007 , 4959 and [ o ii ] @xmath123727 in our mmt spectrum .",
    "the earlier estimate of @xmath24 by @xcite was based on attributing the [ o iii ] @xmath125007 emission line observed at 6800   in their lower s / n spectrum to h@xmath25 .",
    "in table  [ table-2 ] , we define a sample of 50 spectroscopically identified -shaped radio galaxies from the known list and the best candidates from paper  i. of this radio galaxy sample , 15 known sources and 16 vla - first candidates had redshifts available from the literature ; this paper is responsible for the inclusion of the remaining 19 sources with our newly determined redshifts . for this sample",
    ", we can determine the source distances , thus allowing estimates of the absolute optical magnitudes of their host galaxies and the ( monochromatic ) radio luminosities .",
    "we find that the average absolute @xmath26-band magnitude of the -shaped radio galaxy sample is @xmath1523.2 ( 1@xmath27 ; median = @xmath1523.1 ) which is entirely consistent with values for ` normal ' radio galaxies .",
    "specifically , @xcite found an average of @xmath28 ( converting to our adopted cosmology ) for their sample which includes both fr  i and fr  ii sources , and @xcite found an average @xmath29 ( median = @xmath1523.25 ) in their sample of powerful @xmath30 radio galaxies .",
    "as found in paper  i , we confirm that the average 1.4 ghz radio luminosity of our sample is close to the fanaroff - riley division ( average log @xmath31 [ w hz@xmath2]= 25.79 , 1@xmath33 ) .",
    "this is an expected result since -shaped radio galaxies have long been known to have typical radio luminosities near the fr  i / ii division @xcite .    to further explore the relationship of -shaped radio galaxies with the fanaroff - riley division , in figure  [ figure - lm ] , we plot the 1.4 ghz radio luminosity vs. parent host galaxy absolute @xmath26-magnitude diagram for this sample .",
    "owen & ledlow @xcite found a clear dividing line between fr  i and fr  ii radio sources in this diagnostic plane , and this line is drawn in figure  [ figure - lm ] .",
    "as anticipated from their average radio luminosities , the -shaped sources straddle the owen - ledlow fr  i / ii dividing line , but there is a large dispersion . for the sample of known -shaped radio galaxies ( marked with an ` x ' in figure  [ figure - lm ] ) ,",
    "the objects are neatly separated by their fanaroff - riley type morphology with the one clear fr  i radio galaxy ( ngc326 = x02 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) clearly below this line .",
    "the only potential exception is that of 3c  315 ( x14 ) , whose radio morphology on the scale of hundreds of kpc is more typical of an fr  i @xcite but which lies in the fr  ii regime of the owen - ledlow plot ( figure  [ figure - lm ] ) .",
    "however , its central radio component is remarkable in that it is resolved into a few kpc - scale fr  ii - like double @xcite , although this feature is responsible for only a small fraction of the source total luminosity ( see the maps in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a few of the first candidates from paper  i also extend into the fr  i portion of the owen - ledlow plot .",
    "new vla imaging of the sample ( already obtained for many of them ) will allow us to classify their fr type to explore this relationship further in a future paper . at present , the connection between the -shaped source phenomenon and the fanaroff - riley division remains unclear .",
    "new optical spectroscopic observations have been obtained for 27 candidate and known -shaped radio sources .",
    "six had previously known redshifts (   [ sec : known ] ) , and 21 are newly determined redshifts ( 19 candidates from paper  i , one previously known , and one new -shaped source ) . with",
    "only 34/100 -shaped radio source candidates presented in paper  i with redshifts previously available from the literature , this now brings the sample of candidates over 50@xmath0 identified .",
    "more importantly , since our spectroscopic targets were selected as the most promising -shaped source candidates based on their morphologies in the first maps , a large fraction of the most interesting sources are now spectroscopically identified ( see   [ sec : fr ] and table  [ table-2 ] ) .",
    "the sources with redshifts determined in this work are predominantly fainter optically than the 34 -shaped source candidates with previously available redshifts in paper  i ( see figure  [ figure - rz ] ) .",
    "as expected , our targets are found to be typically more distant than previously known examples ( @xmath34 ; paper  i ) . with 8 sources newly determined to have redshifts of @xmath35 ( figure  [ figure - rz ] )",
    ", this extends our census of -shaped sources to higher redshifts .",
    "it is worth mentioning that half of the redshifts taken from the literature were obtained from the sdss @xcite , and these were fairly bright ( @xmath36 1819 ) targets ; our targets are typically fainter and thus will likely not be observed by sdss in the future .",
    "roughly a third of the observed sources have no emission lines detected and the remaining are predominantly strong narrow emission - line objects .",
    "the obvious exceptions are j1342 + 2547 and j1406 + 0647 ( catalog @xmath1367 and @xmath1373 , respectively ) , which also have strong broad emission lines indicative of quasars .",
    "broad - line emission from these two targets was indeed anticipated in paper i based on their bluer optical colors ( @xmath37 and 0.0 , respectively ) .",
    "this adds to the 2 known and 4 candidate broad lined -shaped sources presented in paper i. such broad line objects seem to be relatively rare amongst -shaped radio sources , occurring in only @xmath610@xmath0 of the sample , and these are two excellent examples .",
    "the overall rate of detected emission line objects / types here is consistent with that of normal radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to identify more broad emission - lined objects as they may provide valuable clues as to the possible formation scenarios for -shaped radio morphologies .",
    "specifically , the spectra can be used to constrain systematic velocity offsets between the broad and narrow lines , a possible observational signature of gravitational wave radiation recoil following a supermassive black hole binary merger @xcite .",
    "these , and other aspects of the spectra , will be explored in a future paper to search further for possible clues as to the origin of the unusual morphologies of these radio sources .",
