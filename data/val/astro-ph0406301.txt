    "a combination of optical , infrared , and millimeter observations has provided incontrovertible evidence over the past two decades that most stars are surrounded at birth by circumstellar accretion disks ( e.g. beckwith and sargent , 1996 ) . that at least some of these disks build planets",

    "more indirect but still compelling evidence of planet formation comes from optical and infrared imaging of a few debris disks ( e.g. kalas , liu , & mathews 2004 and weinberger et al .",
    "these solar system - sized dust disks are comprised of micron - sized grains produced as by - products of collisions between asteroid - like bodies with orbits expected to be dynamically stirred by massive planets ( e.g. lagrange et al . 2000 ) .    following the iras discovery of excess infrared emission associated with vega ( auman et al .",

    "neither observatory , however , had the sensitivity to detect _ solar - type stars _ down to photospheric levels at distances greater than a few pc , up to now preventing a complete census of solar - system - like debris disks over a wide ranges of stellar ages .",

    "the unprecedented sensitivity of the spitzer space telescope ( spitzer ; werner et al .",

    "observations and results described here are from early validation data taken with all three spitzer instruments .",
    "targets were selected from among those visible during the validation campaign of december 2003 to be representative of the overall feps sample , the primary control variable of which is stellar age . observed were hd 105 , hd 47875 , hd 150706 , hd 157664 , and hd 161897 ranging in age from 30 myr to 3 gyr .",

    "residual emission ( mostly due to solar system zodiacal dust ) was subtracted using adjacent pixels .",

    "following arguments employed for vega and the other main sequence debris disk archetypes discovered by iras ( backman and paresce 1993 ) , we assume the ir excess emission around hd 105 and hd 150706 is from grains orbiting , and in thermal equilibrium with radiation from , the central stars .",
    "model inner and outer radii for disks containing the cold material around hd 105 and hd 150706 can be calculated with assumptions regarding grain composition , size distributions , and spatial distributions .",
    "the lack of distinct mineralogical features in the observed irs spectra ( which would constrain the dust properties ) means there can be no unique model but rather a range of models that satisfy the observations . for hd 150706 the single data point for the ir",
    "excess translates into a limit that the material must lie farther from the star than @xmath2 11 au if it is in the form of  blackbody \" grains larger than the longest wavelength of significant emission .",
    "smaller grains would satisfy the same temperature constraint at larger distances from the star .",
    "the material around hd 105 is consistent with being distributed in a narrow ring with inner edge r@xmath33 at 42 @xmath6 6 au and an outer edge at r@xmath34 - r@xmath33 @xmath10 4 au if  blackbody \" grains are assumed .",

    "given the above results for hd 105 and hd 150706 from simple models with strong ( but reasonable ) assumptions about the grain properties of the observed disks , we now explore ranges of disk models that are consistent with the data following wolf & hillenbrand ( 2003 ) .",
    "for grain compositions we assumed  astronomical \" silicate plus graphite in the ism ratio and surface density distribution @xmath40 .",
    "the mass of the disk was adjusted to match the peak flux in the infrared excess .",
    "parameters such as grain size distribution @xmath41 power  law exponent , minimum / maximum grain size , and the inner / outer edge of the disk , were varied to find the range of values consistent with the observed spectral energy distribution of hd 105 .",
    "the models were relatively insensitive to the radial density distribution exponent .",
    "the wavelength at which the dust re - emission spectrum begins to depart significantly from the stellar photosphere was used to find the smallest grain size and smallest inner disk radius consistent with the data .",
    "these two parameters are degenerate resulting in single grain sizes in the range 0.3 , 5 , and 8 @xmath0 m requiring inner gap sizes of 1000 , 120 , and 42 au respectively . adopting a minimum grain size of 5 @xmath0 m and allowing for a grain size distribution up to 100 or 1000 @xmath0 m produced lower @xmath42 fits and decreased the required inner radius from 120 to 45 au ( 32 au for a@xmath43 @xmath2 8 @xmath0 m or larger ) .",

    "however , given the optical depth of the dust ( 15300 au@xmath26 , the radiating cross  sectional area ) , the timescale for dust grains to collide is @xmath10 10@xmath49 yrs suggesting that collisions as well as p ",

    "r drag timescale for 1 @xmath0 m grains at 20 au is @xmath10 1 myr compared to an age of 700 @xmath6 300 myr suggesting regeneration of dust through collisions of planetesimals as in the case of hd 105 . in both cases",
    "the lack of circumstellar material in the inner disk ( expected from a model of p ",
    "r drag ) suggests : 1 ) something is preventing dust at 2045 30 au from reaching the sublimation radius in the inner disk ; and 2 ) a lack of significant numbers of colliding planetesimals inside of 2045 au .",
    "this suggests that the inner region is relatively clear of small bodies , consistent with some estimates for the timescale of terrestrial planet formation ( e.g. kenyon and bromley , 2004 ) .",
    "the presence of one or more large planets interior to @xmath2 2045 au may explain the inner edge of the outer dust disk ( e.g. moro  martin and malhotra , 2003 ) .",
    "the preceeding discussion presumed that the gas to dust mass ratio is @xmath10 0.1 , for which the dust dynamics are driven by interactions with the radiation field of the central star .",
    "our high resolution irs observations of the @xmath2 30 myr star hd 105 , still under analysis , should be sensitive to small amounts of gas between 50200 k. the presence of a remnant inner gas disk can influence dust migration and produce a ring morphology such as we infer for the dust ( takeuchi and artymowicz , 2001 ) .",
    "hd 150706 , with an age of 700 @xmath6 300 myr , is less likely to retain a gas  rich disk than hd 105 ( e.g. zuckerman et al . 1995 ) .",
    "however , it does exhibit evidence for a previously undetected dust disk while hd 47875 , hd 157664 , and hd 161897 , ranging in age from 30 myr to 3 gyr , do not at levels comparable to the hd 150706 detection ( table 1 ) .",
    "the disk surrounding hd 150706 has a hole devoid of dust with inner radius of at least 20 au , comparable to the disk surrounding hd 105 .",
    "perhaps the inner region of this disk is being kept clear by the presence of larger bodies as discussed above .",
    "while we can not draw robust conclusions from these small samples , it is clear that other factors ( range in primordial disk properties and/or variations in evolutionary histories ? )",
    "are required to explain the growing body of debris disk observations besides a simple monotonic decrease in dust mass with age .",
