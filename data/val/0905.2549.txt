    "since carbon tetraflouride ( cf@xmath0 ) has a wide spectrum of applications , most of its properties are well determined ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "cf@xmath0 gas has been suggested as a good target for directional  @xcite , spin - dependent dark matter searches  @xcite due to the large spin of the fluorine nucleus and the good ionization - counting properties of the molecule .",
    "however , there is a large discrepancy between existing measurements of electron transport parameters , specifically the diffusion and attachment coefficients , that are of vital importance for the design of low - background particle detectors such as dark matter searches .",
    "detectors that are based on the time - projection - chamber ( tpc ) concept  @xcite require long drift distances of ionization electrons through detector gas in a low electric field .",
    "as a swarm of electrons propagates along an electric field , it spreads transversely and longitudinally , which limits spatial precision of the detector",
    ". current measurements of the transverse spread  @xcite differ by more than an order of magnitude at operating conditions needed for dark matter detection .",
    "primary electrons can also attach to cf@xmath0 molecules ( see @xcite for details ) , which attenuates the electron signal in the detector .",
    "measurements of the attenuation rate also differ by more than an order of magnitude  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we present new measurements of the mean electron energy , that determines the transverse diffusion , and the attentuation coefficient of electrons in cf@xmath0 gas .",
    "the detector ( figure  [ fg::dmtpc10l ] ) is a low - pressure time projection chamber with optical and charge readout .",
    "particles interacting in the sensitive volume of the detector ionize the gas either directly or by creating a charged particle recoil",
    ". the sensitive region of the detector is surrounded by a series of stainless steel rings with inner diameter of 27  cm , outer diameter of 32  cm , and thickness of 1  mm .",
    "the rings are connected with 1  m@xmath1 resistors and separated by nylon washers to keep periodicity at 1  cm .",
    "the last ring in the series is connected via a 2.2  m@xmath1 resistor to a ring holding a grounded mesh and is separated from the mesh by 1.7  cm .",
    "the total height of the drift region is 19.7  cm .",
    "the field uniformity in the drift cage is computed using the finite element method ( fem ) with the scaled transverse field component , @xmath2 , less than 1% .",
    "the cathode is made of a stainless - steel wire mesh with a pitch of 512  @xmath3 m and wire diameter of 31  @xmath3 m .",
    "the grounded electrode is made of a stainless - steel mesh with a pitch of 256  @xmath3 m and wire diameter of 28  @xmath3 m .",
    "the detector consists of two tpcs put back - to - back such that electrons drift toward two amplification planes located in the center of the vessel .",
    "only the top tcp is used in these measurements .    , title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] +    the amplification plane is described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "an amplification gap is created by a copper anode ( + 730  v ) and a grounded mesh separated with 0.53  mm fishing lines that are placed at 2.5  cm intervals .",
    "primary electrons that drift toward the plane start avalanches of electrons and scintillation photons  @xcite .",
    "the detector s primary form of readout is the two - dimensional optical readout of scintillation photons created in the avalanche charge multiplication process .",
    "this scintillation light is collected with a nikon photographic lens with f - stop ratio of 1.2 and a focal length of 55 mm .",
    "the scintillation light is recorded by an apogee u6 camera with a kodak 1001e ccd chip .",
    "in addition to the optical readout , the charge deposited on the anode is also recorded .",
    "we use a proportional preamplifier ( ortec 109pc ) to integrate the charge signal and a shaping amplifier ( ortec 485 ) to make unipolar pulses .",
    "a fast digitizer ( alazar ats860 ) is used to convert pulses into waveforms , which are saved with our event record .",
    "the gas pressure is measured by an inficon pcg400 pressure gauge which utilizes a combination of a capacitance and a pirani gauge .",
    "the spatial resolution is estimated by extracting the track width of 5.486 mev alpha particles from an @xmath4am source .",
    "the observed width of the track along the axis in the readout plane is 300 - 500  @xmath3 m .",
    "the resolution is affected by the number of ccd pixels , @xmath5 merged into a readout bin ( 98@xmath6 ) , the spread of an electron avalanche in the amplification gap ( @xmath7 )  @xcite , and the mesh pitch ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the measurement itself is affected by the imperfect collimation of the source ( 50  @xmath3 m ) and the straggling of alpha particles through cf@xmath0 gas ( 40  @xmath3 m )  @xcite in a 1.2  mm - long track segment .",
    "however , the dominant contribution to the spatial resolution uncertainty comes from the electron diffusion that is described and measured in the next section .",
    "we measure the energy resolution at 5.9  kev for the charge readout using a fe-55 source .",
    "a background - subtracted spectrum of pulse heights is fitted with a narrow gaussian for the full - absorption peak plus a wide gaussian for the escape peak .",
    "the resolution is extracted from the narrower gaussian and is found to be 10% ; a result which is consistent with fano factor of one  @xcite .",
    "we infer the energy resolution for the ccd readout from the amount of light that alpha particles deposit in track segments of different lengths .",
    "the energy deposited into ionization is estimated from the energy loss and calculated by srim  @xcite .",
    "we find that the resolution at 55  kev is approximately 15% , as shown in figure  [ fg::e reso ] .",
    "fe peak from charge readout , and the remaining points are from the optical readout of tracks from the @xmath4am sources .",
    "[ fg::e reso],width=453 ]",
    "electrons propagating through cf@xmath0 gas experience a spread in transverse direction @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the diffusion constant and @xmath3 is the mobility of electrons , i.e. a constant of proportionality between the drift velocity and the electric field .",
    "the @xmath9 parameter is a measure of the average electron energy , @xmath12 .    in previous measurements of @xmath9 , the spread of electron current",
    "was determined with annular anodes that integrate the swarm current  @xcite or with a small - area proportional counter that scans the swarm profile  @xcite .",
    "these approaches yield @xmath9 values that differ by more than an order of magnitude at electric field to number density ratio @xmath13 .",
    "the large data samples of these measurements suggests that the discrepancy is due to an unknown systematic offset , which motivates a new measurement with a different approach .",
    "in this work , we extract @xmath9 from the width of alpha tracks ( @xmath4am ) that are placed at different drift distances inside the drift cage . a 500  ms ccd exposure with alpha tracks emerging from the five sources",
    "is shown in figure  [ fg::imageoffivesources ] .",
    "the gaps in the tracks are the result of missing light due to the resistive separators which are used to maintain the amplification gap separation .",
    "images are taken without a shutter , so it is possible that some alpha tracks appear during the ccd readout . since the ccd is read out in a horizontal direction , these tracks appear shifted to the left or right .",
    "most of such tracks fall out of the fitting range of interest or appear at wrong @xmath14-positions and can be excluded by requiring that the mean of the light distribution of the track segment agrees with the position of the source .",
    "vertical lines depict a 1.2  mm wide region of interest approximately 3  cm from the sources for measurement of track widths .",
    "the kink in the second track from the top is likely due to a large - angle scattering on gas nucleus .",
    "[ fg::imageoffivesources],width=377 ]    we collect 1000 images with 500 ms exposure for each @xmath16 measurement point .",
    "the cf@xmath0 pressure is 50 - 150  torr , and the temperature is roughly 300  k. in each track we select a 1.2  mm long segment taken 3  cm from a source and project it onto the @xmath14-axis .",
    "the projection is then fitted assuming a gaussian signal and a constant term for background , as shown in figure  [ fg::fittosource ] .",
    "we compute the average width squared , @xmath17 , from the collection of all tracks from a single source that have a yield which is consistent with that of a single alpha track .",
    "the width squared is expected to change linearly with the drift distance , @xmath18 , according to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the applied voltage in the drift cage of length @xmath21 .",
    "the detector resolution , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are free parameters that are determined in a fit to measurement points taken at five different drift distances and plotted in figure  [ fg::fit ] .",
    "bin corresponds to 143 @xmath3 m in the image plane .",
    "[ fg::fittosource],width=453 ]     versus @xmath18 for the @xmath24  td data point .",
    "[ fg::fit],width=529 ]    data points are taken at three different pressures ( 50 , 75 and 150  torr ) and various drift voltages ( 1 - 5  kv ) . in regions where @xmath16 values overlap ,",

    "[ fg::eta],width=491 ]    the reported value of @xmath25 is affected by the uncertainty of the pressure gauge ( 2% ) and the temperature sensor ( 2% ) .",
    "we make measurements within a few hours of a new fill with cf@xmath0 gas , so the effect of outgasing is expected to be small .",
    "this is corraborated with previously mentioned stability in @xmath9 and detector gain over several days .",
    "we confirm that the uncertainty in the spectrum model has negligible impact on the attenuation measurement by fitting the spectrum around the full - absorption peak with a single gaussian and observing a change in the peak position of less than 1% .",
    "we also neglect the error due to imperfect collimation of x - ray source , as this does not change the mean of the drift length .",
    "we add all systematic errors in quadrature .",
