    "in this work we aim at _ characterizing _ outliers .",
    "_ outliers _ are the _ exceptional _ objects in the input dataset , that is to say objects that significantly differ from the rest of the data .",
    "approaches to outlier detection introduced in the literature can be classified in supervised @xcite , which exploit a training set of normal and abnormal objects , semi - supervised @xcite , which assume that only normal examples are given , and unsupervised @xcite , which search for outliers in an unlabelled data set .",
    "it is worth to notice that the above mentioned methods focus only on _ identification _ , and they do not concentrate on providing a _ description _ or an _ explanation _ of why an identified outlier is exceptional , which is vice versa the problem we are intended to face here . while outlier detection in datasets has been one of the most widely investigated problems in data mining , the related problem of outlier explanation received less attention in the literature .",
    "it must be noticed that the outlier explanation problem is completely different from supervised and semi - supervised outlier detection , and , moreover , is to be considered orthogonal to the unsupervised outlier detection task .    as an example of outlier explanation task ,",
    "assume you are analyzing health parameters of a sick patient , which include several features such as body temperature , blood pressure measurements and others .",
    "if an history of healthy patients is available , then it is relevant to single out those parameters that mostly differentiate the sick patient from the healthy population .",
    "it is important to highlight here that the abnormal individual , whose peculiar characteristics we want to detect , is provided as an input to the outlier explanation problem , that is , this individual has been recognized as anomalous in advance by the virtue of some external information , mean or procedure .",
    "the focus of this paper is the discovery of _ outlying properties _ : we are interested in unveiling the hidden structures that make an input outlier object @xmath0 special w.r.t . an input population .",
    "this can be accomplished ( @xmath1 ) by detecting the subsets @xmath2 of the input population that represent an homogeneous sub - population , intuitively a set of objects sharing similar features ( which we will refer to as _ explanations _ ) , including @xmath0 , and ( @xmath3 ) by identifying attributes ( also referred to as _ properties _ ) where @xmath0 substantially differentiates from the other objects in @xmath2 .    with this aim , subspace outlier mining techniques , like the one presented in @xcite ,",
    "could in principle be used to extract information about outlier properties . however , the originary task considered in @xcite is different from the task investigated here , since subspaces therein highlight the outlierness , whereas in our approach they represent an homogeneous subpopulation upon which to compare a given property . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors focus on the identification of the intensional knowledge associated with distance - based outliers .",
    "however , this setting models outliers which are exceptional with respect to the whole population , but it does not capture objects that are exceptional only if compared to homogeneous subpopulations . in @xcite",
    "an outlier subpopulation is given in input and compared with the inlier population in order to simultaneously characterize the whole exceptional subpopulation . despite the latter approach shares with ours a common rationale , we note that the framework considered in @xcite is different and the solutions there proposed can not be applied to the special case in which the outlier sub - population consists of just one single individual , which is precisely the scenario considered here .",
    "a viable solution to the outlying property detection problem has been devised in @xcite .",
    "specifically , a set of attributes witnesses the abnormality of an object if the combination of values the object assumes on these attributes is very infrequent with respect to the overall distribution of the attribute values in the dataset , and this is measured my means of the so called _ outlierness _ score . a major problem with the outlierness score presented in @xcite",
    "is that it was specifically designed and shown effective for categorical attributes .",
    "hence the question is how to adapt that idea to a more general setting with both categorical and numerical attributes .",
    "we point out that discretizing numerical attributes and applying the technique of @xcite to the discretized attributes is not a suitable solution , for several reasons .",
    "first of all , the result of the analysis will strongly depend on the results of the discretization process .",
    "this drawback is further exacerbated by the peculiarities of the outlierness measure , which assigns higher scores to very unbalanced distributions , and by contrast provides low scores to uniform frequency distributions . in a sense",
    ", the discretization process should be supervised by the outlierness score , in order to detect in the first place the bins capable of magnifying the score itself .",
    "the appropriate treatment of numerical attributes is indeed one of the main problems we deal with in this paper .",
    "specifically , the main contribution of this work amounts to provide an _ outlierness _ measure representing a refined generalization of that proposed in @xcite and which is able to quantify the exceptionality of a given numerical or categorical _ property _ featured by the given input anomalous object with respect to a reference data population .",
    "in particular , in order to quantify the degree of unbalanceness between the frequency of the value under consideration and the frequencies of the rest of the database values , our measure analyzes the curve of the cumulative distribution function ( _ cdf _ ) associated with the occurrence probability of the domain values .",
    "it is worth noting that relying on the _ cdf _ allows to correctly recognize exceptional properties independently of the form of the underlying probability density function ( _ pdf _ ) , since the former compares the occurrence probabilities of the domain values rather than directly comparing the domain values themselves .",
    "this enables us to build a general methodology for uniformly mining exceptional properties in the presence of both categorical and numerical attributes , so that a fully automated support is provided to decode those properties determining the abnormality of the given object within the reference data context .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sect : outlierness0 ] introduces the outlierness measure and the concept of explanation .",
    "section [ sect : algo ] describes the method for computing outlierness and determining associated explanations .",
    "section [ sect : experim ] discusses experimental results . finally , section [ sect : concl ] presents conclusions and discusses future work",
    "to begin with , we fix some notation to be used throughout the paper . in the following , @xmath4 denotes an _ attribute _ , that is an identifier with an associated domain @xmath5 , and @xmath6 denotes a set of @xmath7 attributes .",
    "the _ value _ @xmath8 associated with the attribute @xmath9 in the object @xmath0 will be denoted by @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "a _ database _",
    "@xmath11 on a set of attributes @xmath12 is a multi - set of objects on @xmath13 .",
    "we shall characterize populations in a `` rule - based '' fashion , by denoting the subset of @xmath11 that embodies them .",
    "formally , a _ condition _ on @xmath12 is an expression of the form @xmath14 $ ] , where ( @xmath1 ) @xmath15 , ( @xmath3 ) @xmath16 , and ( @xmath17 ) @xmath18 , if @xmath4 is numeric , and @xmath19 , if @xmath4 is categorical .",
    "if @xmath19 , the interval @xmath20 $ ] is sometimes abbreviated as @xmath21 and the condition as @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",

    "moreover , @xmath0 satisfies a set of conditions @xmath29 if and only if @xmath0 satisfies each condition @xmath30 .",
    "given a set @xmath29 of conditions on @xmath12 .",
    "the _ selection _",
    "@xmath31 of the database @xmath11 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath29 is the database consisting of the objects @xmath32 satisfying @xmath29 .",
    "next , the definitions of outlierness and explanation are introduced .",
    "this measure is used to quantify the exceptionality of a property .",
    "the intuition underlying this measure is that an attribute makes an object exceptional if the relative likelihood of the value assumed by that object on the attribute is rare if compared to the relative likelihood associated with the other values assumed on the same attribute by the other objects of the database .",
    "let @xmath4 be an attribute of @xmath33 .",
    "we assume that a random variable @xmath34 is associated with the attribute @xmath4 , which models the domain of @xmath4 .",
    "then , with @xmath35 we denote the pdf associated with @xmath34 .",
    "the pdf provides a first indication on the outlierness degree of a given value @xmath36 , as usually we would expect low pdf values associated to outliers .",
    "however , the sole pdf value is not enoughs .",
    "a given pdf value represents a hypothetical `` frequency '' for that value in the sample under consideration .",
    "how typical is that `` frequency '' provides a better insight on the outlierness degree : a low pdf value in a population exhibiting low values only is not an indicator of an outlier , whereas an anomalous low pdf value in a population of significantly higher values denotes that the value under observation represents an outlier .",
    "thus , analyzing how the values distribute on a pdf is the key for measuring the degree of outlierness .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the random variable whose pdf represents the relative likelihood for the pdf @xmath38 to assume a certain value .",
    "the cdf @xmath39 of @xmath37 is : @xmath40    assume that the height of the individuals of a population is normally distributed with mean @xmath41 and standard deviation @xmath42 .",
    "then , let @xmath4 be the attribute representing the height , @xmath34 is a random variable following the same distribution of the domain and @xmath35 is the associated pdf , reported in the first graph of fig .",

    "the cdf @xmath45 associated with @xmath44 denotes the probability for @xmath38 to assume value less than or equal to @xmath46 .",
    "then , @xmath47 for each @xmath48 and @xmath49 for each @xmath50 . to compute the value of @xmath45 for a generic @xmath46 , the integral reported in equation has to be evaluated .",
    "the resulting function is reported in the second graph of fig .",

    "we employ the mapping @xmath60 the first integral measures the _ area above _ the cdf @xmath61 for @xmath62)$ ] , while the second integral measures the _ area below _ the cdf @xmath39 for @xmath63)$ ] .",

    "however , we wish to point out that our measure is able to correctly recognize exceptional properties irrespectively of the form of the underlying pdf , since it compares the occurrence probabilities of the domain values rather than directly comparing the original domain values .    given an object @xmath0 and a dataset @xmath11 on a set of attributes @xmath77 , an attribute @xmath78 showing a large ( i.e. exceeding a given threshold ) value @xmath79 of outlierness will be called a ( _ outlying _ ) _ property _ of @xmath0 in @xmath11 .",

    "relevant subsets of the database upon which to investigate outlierness can be hence obtained by selecting the database objects satisfying a condition , and such that a property is exceptional for @xmath0 .    a condition @xmath24 ( set of conditions @xmath29 , resp . )",

    "@xmath84 with _ explanation _",
    "@xmath29 is defined as @xmath85 .",
    "it is worth noticing that , according to the relative size of @xmath31 , not all the explanations should be considered equally relevant . in the following , we concentrate on @xmath86-explanations , i.e. , conditions @xmath29 such that @xmath87 , where @xmath88 $ ] is a user - defined parameter .",
    "thus , given an object @xmath0 of a database @xmath11 on a set of attributes @xmath89 , and parameters @xmath90 $ ] and @xmath91 $ ] , the problem of interest here is : _ find the pairs @xmath92 , with @xmath93 and @xmath94 , such that @xmath95 is a @xmath96-explanation and @xmath97 .",
    "_    the pair @xmath92 is also called an ( _ outlier _ ) _ explanation - property pair _ of @xmath0 in @xmath11 .",
    "in order to detect outlying properties and their explanations , we need to solve two basic problems : ( 1 ) computing the outlierness of a certain multiset of values and ( 2 ) determining the conditions to be employed to form explanations .",
    "the strategies we have designed to solve these two problems exploit a common framework , which is based on kernel density estimation ( kde ) .",
    "specifically , given a numerical attribute @xmath4 , in order to estimate the pdf @xmath38 we exploit _ generalized kernel density estimation _ @xcite , according to which the estimated density at point @xmath98 is @xmath99 here , @xmath100 is a kernel function , and @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are @xmath104-dimensional vectors denoting the _ kernel location _ , _ weight _ , and _ bandwidth _ , respectively .",
    "the above mentioned strategies are detailed next , together with the method for mining outlying properties .      in order to compute the outlierness ,",
    "we specialize formula in equation by setting @xmath105 and @xmath106 , thus obtaining @xmath107 where @xmath108 are the values in @xmath109 : y\\in{{\\it db}}\\}$ ] , each term @xmath110 is equal to @xmath111 , with @xmath112 a global bandwidth ( as a rule of thumb , the global @xmath112 is set to @xmath113 ) and @xmath114 .",
    "the rationale underlying this choice is that we want that each value at hand ( @xmath115 ) contributes in equal manner ( @xmath106 ) to the estimation of the underlying pdf .",
    "moreover , we employ the _ parzen window _ kernel function , that is @xmath116 , for @xmath117 , and @xmath118 otherwise , since this kernel represents a good trade off between simplicity of computation and accuracy . indeed , the above density estimate can be computed in time @xmath119 by means of a sort of the attribute domain .",
    "we also notice that , since the outlierness depends on the cdf of the pdf values , this greatly mitigates the impact of the non - smoothness of the estimate of the pdf through parzen windows , other than making the measure robust w.r.t",
    ". deviations of the estimate from the real distribution .",
    "proper conditions are the basic building blocks for the explanations .",
    "to single them out , our strategy consists in finding , for each attribute @xmath4 , the `` natural '' interval @xmath120 including @xmath26 $ ] , namely , an interval of homogeneous values on @xmath4 .",
    "natural intervals , in our modeling , represent a partitioning of @xmath5 according to the density @xmath35 : intuitively , an interval is a high density area separated by another interval by a low - density area .",
    "the search for feasible intervals still relies on adopting the kernel density family introduced so far , but according to a different interpretation . in practice , for each attribute @xmath4 , we estimate @xmath38 by means of @xmath121 .",
    "this latter function can be interpreted as a mixture density over the parameter sets @xmath122 .",
    "hence the intervals can be obtained by estimating such parameters .",
    "to this purpose , we adopt the gaussian kernel @xmath123 and devise the simplifying latent assumption that each data point is generated by a unique kernel location .",
    "this allows us to adopt an em - based maximum likelihood approach , where the resulting iterative scheme draws from @xcite , and updates locations and bandwidths according to the following equations : @xmath124 here , @xmath125 represents the mixing probability that value @xmath1 is associated with the @xmath126-th kernel location and , in its turn , is computed at each iteration as : @xmath127 we also adapt the annihilation procedure proposed in @xcite , which allows for an automatic estimation of the optimal number @xmath128 of kernel locations , as well as to ignore the initialization issues .",
    "the estimation of the parameters is accomplished iteratively for each location@xmath126 , where each weight is computed as @xmath129 whenever a weight equals to @xmath130 , the contribution of its component annihilates in the density estimation . as a consequence ,",
    "the iterative procedure can start with a high initial value @xmath128 , and the initialization of each mixing probability can be done randomly without compromising the final result .",
    "to summarize , the overall scheme can be described as follows :    1 .",
    "initialize @xmath125 randomly .",
    "2 .   for each @xmath126 compute @xmath131 ; if @xmath132 then update @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "3 .   recompute @xmath125 and return to step 2 , until the improvement in likelihood is negligible .",
    "the _ natural interval _ of @xmath0 in @xmath4 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath11 can be obtained by exploiting the @xmath125 values .",
    "first of all , each @xmath135 can be assigned to a location @xmath136 .",
    "then , let @xmath137 be the location wich @xmath26 $ ] is assigned to .",
    "the interval @xmath120 is then uniquely identified by @xmath138 $ ] , where @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "given a dataset @xmath11 on the set of attributes @xmath141 , an outlier object @xmath0 , parameters @xmath90 $ ] , @xmath91 $ ] , and positive integer @xmath142 ( representing an upper bound to the size of an acceptable explanation ) , the algorithm _ outlying - property detector _",
    "computes all the pairs @xmath92 , with @xmath143 and @xmath144 , such that :    1 .",
    "@xmath95 is a @xmath96-explanation , and 2 .",
    "the outlierness @xmath145 is not smaller than @xmath146 , and 3 .",
    "@xmath92 is _ minimal _ , that is there is not a pair @xmath147 with @xmath148 for which both points 1 and 2 hold .",
    "the algorithm consists of two main phases . during the first phase , for each attribute @xmath149 , the interval @xmath150 and ,",
    "hence , the associated condition @xmath151 , is determined by means of the procedure described in section [ sect : algo_cond ] .",
    "given the set of conditions @xmath152 on the @xmath7 attributes in @xmath89 , the second phase exploits an apriori - like strategy @xcite in order to search for the pairs @xmath92 with @xmath153 meeting the above mentioned conditions .",
    "the computed pairs are accumulated in the set @xmath154 , which represents the output of the algorithm .",
    "the parameter @xmath155 here is introduced in order to bind the size of an acceptable explanation . as a matter of fact ,",
    "greater values of @xmath155 trigger larger explanations which are likely to lower the support to unacceptable values . also , large explanations result difficult to interpret .",
    "notice that by setting @xmath155 to the value @xmath7 all the pairs can be mined . in the experimental section",
    "we study the effects of the @xmath155 parameter on the performances .    as for the cost of the above procedure , the first step is basically depends on the rate of convergence of the em algorithm . by assuming that the number @xmath104 of kernel locations is initially set to @xmath156 ,",
    "the basic iteration is @xmath157 .",
    "notice , however , that interval components annihilate early in the first iterations , so practically we can assume that the number of intervals @xmath128 is bounded to a constant value .",
    "thus , the overall complexity of the first step is linear in the size of the data and the number of iterations . clearly , the rate of convergence of the algorithm is also of practical interest , and it is usually slower than the quadratic convergence typically available with newton - type methods .",
    "@xcite shows that the rate of convergence of the em algorithm is linear and the it depends on the proportion of information in the observed data .",
    "as far as the second step is concerned , computing the outlierness costs @xmath158 . since these two sub - steps are executed at most @xmath159 times",
    ", the overall cost of step 2 is @xmath160 .",
    "however , notice that the apriori - like strategy greatly reduces the size of portion of the search space to be explored , so that the total number of conditions explored in practice is much smaller .",
    "we evaluate the technique on both real - life and synthesized datasets , with the aim of showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach . the ground truth in such datasets",
    "is represented by outlier tuples , detected by resorting to the feature bagging algorithm described in @xcite . briefly",
    ", the technique detects outliers by iteratively running a base outlier detection algorithm on a subset of the available attributes .",
    "outlier detected in the various runs are then scored by adopting a _",
    "function which assigns a score to each outlier .",
    "the bagging technique was instantiated by exploting the base od method described in @xcite , where the parameters are set to produce just a single outlier .",
    "further , the _ combine _ technique adopted simply scores outliers on the basis of the positive responses they get within the iterations : if a tuple is detected as an outlier in a given iteration , it gets a positive score .",
    "scores are then summarized in the combine function , and tuples are sorted according to the scores .    the feature bagging technique boosts the robustness of base outlier detection techniques .",
    "by contrast , it is difficult to manually infer ( e.g. , by means of visualization techniques ) justification for outlierness : a tuple can be reputed an outlier for a combination of factors which in turn depend on different subsets of the attributes . as a consequence , the analysis of the outliers produced with such a technique provides a significant benchmark on the effectiveness of the outlier explanation technique .",
    "we employ three real datasets from the uci machine learning repository @xcite .",
    "the first two datasets , namely _ ecoli _ ( with @xmath161 instances and @xmath162 attributes ) and _ yeast _ ( with @xmath163 instances and @xmath164 attributes ) , contain information about protein localization sites .",
    "the third database , called _ cloud _ , contains information about cloud cover and includes @xmath165 instances with @xmath166 attributes .",
    "the support threshold @xmath96 has been set to @xmath167 and the maximum number @xmath155 of conditions in the explanation to @xmath168 .",
    "the following table reports the explanation - property pairs scoring the maximum value of outlierness .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     it can be noticed that the time is split into the two main operations , namely the identification of intervals , and the computation of the outlierness degree .",
    "the two routines tend to balance the cost of the overall computation . however , since the parameter @xmath155 is likely to affect the performance of the outlier computation , we study the latter on increasing value of the parameter . as a matter of fact ,",
    "greater values of @xmath155 trigger larger explanations which are likely to lower the support to unacceptable values .",
    "figure [ fig : perf ] plots the total outlier computation time for increasing values of @xmath155 .",
    "the curves tend to flatten for increasing values , on all datasets , as an affect of the shrinking of @xmath169 when @xmath29 tends to become large .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the computation of the outlierness degree based on kernel density estimation provides a true advantage over the alternative approach of first discretizing the attributes , and then applying the originary method described in @xcite .",
    "to this aim , we perform further tests on synthesized data . in particular",
    ", we generate a dataset ( named _ unif2 _ in the following ) , consisting of @xmath170 objects .",
    "this dataset contains an outlier @xmath0 which is distinguished from the rest of the population from the value it assumes on a particular attribute @xmath33 .",
    "specifically , almost all values of this attribute belong to two equally - sized uniformly distributed clusters , the first one in the range @xmath171 $ ] and the second one in the range @xmath172 $ ] .",
    "the only exception is represented by the object @xmath0 , for which @xmath173=0 $ ] holds . in the following , we concentrate the comparison on the analysis of the behavior of the two methods on the attribute @xmath33 , in order to demonstrate that while @xmath33 is naturally perceived as an outlying property by the technique hereby introduced , it is very unlikely to obtain the same goal when the technique in @xcite is employed .                 in order to apply the latter method to the _",
    "dataset , we discretize the attributes by grouping attribute values in equi - width bins .",
    "figure [ fig : unif2a ] reports on the left the value of the outlierness ( as defined in @xcite ) on the value @xmath173 $ ] according to different bins sizes employed in discretizing the data .",
    "specifically , the number of bins has been varied from @xmath75 to @xmath174 .",
    "the experiment highlights that when the method in @xcite is applied , the outcome of the analysis strongly depends on the discretization adopted .",
    "in particular when the number of bins is in the range @xmath175 $ ] the outlierness measure fluctuates between 0.3 and 1 .",
    "this means that even small changes in the number of bins produce results which can dramatically change .",
    "this is a very undesirable property , since determining the right number of bins for the analysis at hand is a very challenging task .",
    "figure [ fig : unif2b ] , showing different frequency histograms associated with the attribute @xmath33 , should further clarify things .",
    "the histogram associated with the best outlierness value , namely outlierness @xmath176 , is the one using @xmath177 bins ( at the center of the figure ) . in this case , the central bin ( centered in zero ) scores a low value of absolute frequency .",
    "differently , for both @xmath166 bins ( reported on the left in the same figure ) or @xmath178 bins ( reported on the right ) , the fact that the outlierness of @xmath33 in @xmath0 is sensibly smaller can be explained by looking at the displayed histograms . in both cases ,",
    "the value of @xmath0 is grouped with some more frequent values and , hence , the corresponding outlierness value gets sensibly smaller .",
    "providing a larger number of bins does not solve the problem : as already pointed out , the scoring functions assigns a score close to @xmath179 to very unbalanced distributions , while its value rapidly decreases when frequencies spread . and ,",
    "indeed , with a large bin size the number of different categorical values ( each associated with a different bin ) becomes large , and these values score about the same absolute frequency .",
    "the consequence is that the outlierness values get small as well .",
    "we can conclude that in order to enable the method @xcite to discover meaningful knowledge , the bins that maximize the score should be detected in the first place .",
    "however , the interaction with explanations ( which select subsets of the overall population ) makes it difficult to provide optimal a - priori intervals , since the distribution of the property attribute are likely to change when switching from one explanation to another .",
    "this is clearly not the case with the technique proposed in this paper .",
    "since the outlierness measure defined here directly exploits the density estimate of the object value , it is completely adaptive to numerical data and does not suffer of the aforementioned drawbacks .",
    "the outlierness computed by our method is @xmath180 .",
    "figure [ fig : unif2b ] on the right shows the density estimate of attribute @xmath33 , together with the value associated to @xmath0 ( notice the circle on the curve ) , which is exploited in order to compute the outlierness associated with @xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of this paper has been that of devising techniques by which the outlying properties detection problem can be solved in the presence of both categorical and numerical attributes , which represents a step forward with respect to available literature .",
    "the core of our approach has been the definition of a sensible outlierness measure , representing a refined generalization of that proposed in @xcite , which is able to quantify the exceptionality of a given property featured by the given input anomalous object with respect to a reference data population .",
    "also , we have developed algorithms to detect properties characterizing the anomalous object provided in input .",
    "the experimental results we have obtained confirm that the presented approach is more than promising . as a matter of fact",
    ", there are several application scenarios where the proposed technique can be profitably applied .",
    "further scenarios include rank learning problems like in @xcite : there , the problem of detecting rules for characterizing individuals who are scored as exceptional according to a specific scoring function ( like , e.g. , the amount of fraud they commit in a fraud detection scenario ) is investigated .",
    "it is clear that if exceptional objects are reputed as outliers , then the outlier explanation technique described in this paper could be exploited as a basic building block for rule learning in that domain .",
