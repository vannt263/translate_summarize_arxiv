    "study of the electron - electron interaction in graphene is also important for understanding of this effect , see ref .",
    "@xcite . however , a theoretical progress in this problem is rather limited @xcite .",
    "it is well established now that the low - energy single electron dynamics in graphene is described by a massless two - component dirac equation @xcite @xmath0 where the hamiltonian @xmath1 has the form @xmath2 @xmath3 is the fermi velocity , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the pauli matrices acting on the pseudospin variables .",
    "below we set @xmath6 .",
    "evidently , the pair of non - interacting electrons can be described by the equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the wave function of the system , depending on the coordinates and pseudospin variables of both electrons .",
    "the generalization of eq . to the case of interacting electrons is a highly nontrivial problem .",
    "the origin of the difficulties is the necessity to take into account the interaction with the electrons below fermi surface .",
    "this interaction results in the existence of the electron - hole excitations in the intermediate states .",
    "the account of the corresponding effects in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) leads to the dyson - schwinger equation ( which , for the bound states , reduces to the bethe - salpeter equation ) , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite .",
    "however , in the nonrelativistic qed systems , the effect of virtual electron - positron pair in the intermediate states is small . for massless electrons in graphene , the nonrelativistic approximation is not applicable and the effect of virtual electron - hole excitation may be crucially important for the problem of electron - electron interaction .",
    "the approach based on the bethe - salpeter equation was used in ref .",
    "@xcite in the investigation of electron - hole interaction in graphene .",
    "though the influence of the electron - hole excitations can be very important , nevertheless , as a first step in the investigation of the electron - electron interaction , it makes sense to ignore this effect and to model the electron - electron interaction by replacing @xmath9 in eq . , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the electron - electron interaction potential .",
    "recently , this model has been considered in ref.@xcite , where the eigenfunctions of @xmath12 have been analysed .",
    "the solutions found in ref.@xcite appeared to have unusual properties . in order to understand the origin of these properties ,",
    "we revisit in the present paper the solution of the stationary equation @xmath13 .",
    "we also consider the time - dependent problem and demonstrate that the unusual properties of the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian are reflected in the very specific properties of the time evolution of the wave packets .",
    "we restrict our consideration to the specific case of zero total momentum of the pair and search for the solutions being the eigenstates of the operator @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the azimuth angle of the vector @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the potential @xmath17 is a smooth positive monotonically decreasing vanishing function . to include the important case of the coulomb potential into the consideration , we allow for the @xmath18 growth of the potential at @xmath19 .",
    "the solution of the stationary equation shows that the wave functions with @xmath20 are smooth functions for any energy @xmath21 .",
    "this is also valid for the wave functions with @xmath22 and the energy above the maximum of the potential @xmath23 or below zero . for @xmath22 and @xmath24",
    ", the solution of the stationary equation necessarily has singularity at the point @xmath25 determined by the condition @xmath26 which is in agreement with ref . @xcite .",
    "such a behaviour contradicts a common wisdom which tells one that the wave function should be a smooth function in the region where the potential is also smooth .",
    "we show that the existence of the singularity in the wave function is related to the degeneracy of the derivative matrix in the hamiltonian .",
    "we find an important new feature of the energy spectrum : the additional degeneracy of the states with fixed @xmath27 and energy in the interval @xmath28 .    for the time - dependent problem",
    "we choose the initial conditions corresponding to the wide spherical wave packet with fixed @xmath29 and the average energy @xmath30 ( average value of the hamiltonian ) moving toward the origin from the large distance @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the width of the packet ( the energy dispersion in the packet @xmath33 ) .",

    "observes not only a reflected wave packet moving toward the large @xmath35 , but also a narrow peak in the vicinity of @xmath36 with the width @xmath37 .",
    "the total norm of the wave function is conserved as it should be for a hermitian hamiltonian . in order to check consistency of the results obtained ,",
    "we demonstrate that the solution of the time - dependent equation based on the decomposition of the initial wave packet over the stationary wave functions reproduces the direct numerical solution of this equation . using this decomposition , we find the large - time asymptotics of the emerged peak analytically .",
