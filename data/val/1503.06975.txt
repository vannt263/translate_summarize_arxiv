    "in the last years ab initio approaches have gained an ever increasing importance in the calculation of bound - state and reaction observables of nuclear systems with a nucleon number @xmath1 ( for a comparison of various techniques see  @xcite ) .",
    "a particularly challenging aspect in such calculations is the proper treatment of resonances .",
    "recently , via the eihh expansion technique  @xcite , the lorentz integral transform ( lit ) method @xcite was applied to calculate the isoscalar monopole strength of the @xmath0he@xmath2 reaction with realistic nuclear forces paying special attention to the role of the low - lying @xmath3 resonance of @xmath0he  @xcite .",
    "while the resonance strength could be obtained , it was not possible to determine the width of the resonance .",
    "as it was explained the origin of this deficiency arises from the too low density of lit states in the resonance region , but it was not really clear why the density happens to be so low .",
    "one may think of various possible reasons : ( i ) the lit method is based on bound - state techniques and might be incapable to describe the shape of narrow resonances , ( ii ) the used expansion in hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) was not extended to a sufficiently large basis , or ( iii ) the hh expansion itself is not able to have a sufficient density of lit states in the resonance region .",
    "the first possibility can be safely ruled out .",
    "in fact in @xcite it was shown that for a fictitious two - nucleon system with a narrow resonance in the @xmath4 partial wave exact information about the shape of the resonance could be obtained with the lit method .",
    "thus the aim of the present paper is to study which of the two remaining reasons is responsible for the partial failure of the lit method in @xcite and how one can improve the calculation for having a precise information on the resonance width .    to clarify the matter first a classical two - body problem , namely deuteron photodisintegration in unretarded dipole approximation ,",
    "is discussed .",
    "it is shown how the density of lit states can be increased in this case . in a next step",
    "it is considered how one can achieve such an increase also for the above mentioned isoscalar monopole strength of the @xmath0he@xmath2 reaction . in order to do so",
    "a central nn potential model ( tn potential ) is used that had been previously employed in the very first lit applications for the calculation of the electromagnetic break - up of @xmath0he by electrons and real photons  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that in @xcite one already finds a clear signal of the @xmath3 resonance in the @xmath0he longitudinal response function , however , at that early stage of lit applications the resonance was not studied in greater detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  ii contains a brief description of the lit method . in section  iii",
    "the question of the density of the lit states is addressed and illustrated for the above mentioned two - body case . a lit calculation for the isoscalar monopole strength of the @xmath0he@xmath2",
    "is discussed in section  iv , where it will be shown how an hh calculation can be modified in order to determine the width of narrow resonances .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section  v.",
    "over the years the lit approach  @xcite has been applied to a variety of inelastic electroweak reactions .",
    "a rather large number of applications can be found in the review articles @xcite .",
    "the lit of a function @xmath5 is defined as follows @xmath6 where the kernel @xmath7 is a lorentzian , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) ; the parameter @xmath10 controls the width of the lorentzian . because of the adjustable width , and different from many other integral transforms , the lit is a transform with a controlled resolution .",
    "however , aiming at a higher resolution by reducing @xmath10 might make it necessary to increase the precision of the calculation .",
    "this point will be discussed in greater detail in section  iii .    for inclusive reactions",
    "the lit @xmath11 is calculated by solving an equation of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hamiltonian of the system under consideration and @xmath14 is an asymptotically vanishing source term related to the operator inducing the specific reaction . the solution @xmath15 is localized . this a very important property , since it allows to determine @xmath15 with bound - state methods , even for reactions where the many - body continuum is involved .",
    "having calculated @xmath15 one obtains the lit from the following expression @xmath16 the response function @xmath5 is determined from the calculated @xmath11 by inverting the transform . a general discussion of the inversion and details about various inversion methods are given in @xcite .",
    "an alternative way to express the lit is given by @xmath17 this reformulation is useful since it allows a direct application of the lanczos algorithm for the determination of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "in fact the calculations discussed in the following sections are performed using expansions on basis sets with a subsequent use of the lanczos technique .    in order to calculate",
    "a specific reaction one has to specify the source term @xmath14 in eqs .",
    "( [ eqlit ] ) and ( [ liteq ] ) . in case of an inclusive electroweak reaction response functions",
    "have the general form @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are ground - state and final - state wave functions of the system under consideration , while @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the corresponding eigenenergies and @xmath23 is the energy transferred to the system , finally , @xmath24 is the specific transition operator that induces the reaction .",
    "note that different from the normal convention here the argument of the response function @xmath25 is @xmath22 and not @xmath26 .",
    "the source term @xmath14 for inclusive reactions has the following form @xmath27    a solution of the lit equation  ( [ liteq ] ) via an expansion on a basis with @xmath28 basis functions can be understood as follows .",
    "one determines the spectrum of the hamiltonian for this basis thus finding @xmath28 eigenstates @xmath29 with eigenenergies @xmath30 .",
    "the energies @xmath30 define the positions of the above mentioned lit states .",
    "furthermore , the lit solution assigns to any eigenenergy a lorentzian with strength @xmath31 and width @xmath10 .",
    "it should be noticed that the source term @xmath32 solely affects the strength leading to @xmath33 the lit result then reads @xmath34 note that this result is related to the so - called lanczos response @xmath35 by @xmath36 in the limit @xmath37 the lanczos response is equal to the true response function @xmath25 .",
    "however , one often calculates @xmath35 for a small but finite @xmath10 value and identifies the lanczos response with the true response , which in general is an uncontrolled approximation . in the lit approach",
    "one does not make such an identification of transform and response function .",
    "a proper treatment requires an inversion ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to note that the definition of the lit in eq .",
    "( 1 ) contains the full response function @xmath25 with all break - up channels . for the calculation of the lit one may use any complete localized @xmath38-body basis set . automatically for any such set strength from all break - up channels",
    "is contained in the lit .",
    "however , in principle , it can happen that in a specific energy interval of a given reaction one basis set is more advantageous than another one .",
    "in fact , such a case is discussed in section  iv .",
    "to better illustrate the lit energy resolution a simple two - body case is discussed , namely deuteron photodisintegration in unretarded dipole approximation .",
    "the corresponding cross section is given by @xmath39 where @xmath26 denotes the photon energy and @xmath40 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the transition operator for the response function @xmath41 is the dipole operator , @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the z - components of the position vector and of the isospin operator of the ith nucleon , respectively . in case of the deuteron the dipole operator induces only transitions to the @xmath45 final states @xmath46 @xmath4 , and @xmath47-@xmath48 . for simplicity in the following example only transitions to the @xmath4 partial wave",
    "are considered .",
    "the ansatz for the corresponding @xmath15 reads @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath14 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the relative distance , orbital angular momentum , total spin , total angular momentum , and isospin of the @xmath45 pair , respectively .",
    "the resulting lit equation can be easily solved by direct numerical methods or by expansions of @xmath53 on a complete set . for nuclei with @xmath54 very often",
    "hh expansions are used with separate hyperspherical and hyperradial parts , where the latter is usually expanded in laguerre polynomials @xmath55 times an exponential fall - off .",
    "therefore a corresponding ansatz is made here for r(r ) , @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the expansion coefficients and @xmath58 is a parameter regulating the spatial extension of the basis .",
    "nn channel with the av18 nn potential for the basis of eqs .",
    "( [ 3p1_a],[3p1 ] ) with various values of @xmath28 and @xmath58 : @xmath59 with @xmath60 fm , 0.5 fm , and 0.25 fm in ( a ) and @xmath61 fm with @xmath59 , 30 , and 50 in ( b).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    for the following lit results of the @xmath4 channel the av18 nn potential  @xcite is used .",
    "first the hamiltonian eigenvalues @xmath30 , entering in eq .",
    "( [ lit_en ] ) , are studied for various basis sets . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "1 results are shown with 11 basis functions ( @xmath59 ) and different values for the extension parameter @xmath58 .",
    "one sees that a greater spatial extension of the basis functions leads to a shift of the spectrum to lower energies . as lowest ( highest ) eigenenergies one finds 5.17 mev ( 7424 mev ) , 1.27 mev ( 2689 mev ) , and 0.32 mev ( 790 mev ) for @xmath62 , 0.5 , and 1 fm , respectively . to obtain a higher density of lit states one has to increase the number of the basis states @xmath28",
    "this is illustrated in the lower panel of fig .  1 , where the cases with @xmath59 , 30 , and 50 are shown for @xmath61 fm .",
    "it is evident that the increase of basis functions does not only lead to a higher density of lit states , but also to an extension of the eigenvalues @xmath30 both to lower and higher energies .",
    "in fact as lowest ( highest ) values one has now 1.27 mev ( 2689 mev ) , 0.19 mev ( 11056 mev ) , and 0.076 mev ( 25457 mev ) for @xmath59 , 30 , and 50 , respectively .",
    "if one chooses the energy range up to pion threshold one finds that in all three cases about two - thirds of the @xmath28 lit states are located therein .     of the @xmath4 channel with @xmath63 mev and @xmath61 fm .",
    "( a ) : @xmath59 and 50 ; ( b ) : the ratio @xmath64 of the lit with @xmath59 , 20 , 30 , and 40 to the lit with @xmath65 ( the values 0.995 and 1.005 are illustrated by full lines).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    after having discussed the energy distribution of the lit states we come to the transform @xmath11 itself . first , in fig .  2 ,",
    "the case with @xmath63 mev and @xmath61 fm is illustrated .",
    "the upper panel of the figure shows that an increase of the number of basis functions from 11 ( @xmath59 ) to 51 ( @xmath28=50 ) does not lead to noticeable differences . in other words , in this case , the lit is already quite well converged with a rather small basis .",
    "this nice agreement of both results is not obvious , since fig .",
    "1 exhibits rather different positions and densities of the lit states for both cases .",
    "this has to be interpreted as follows .",
    "a discretization of the continuum has no direct physical meaning and leads in principle to random results . on the contrary",
    "one can use the discretization to calculate integral transforms , as for example the lit , which lead in convergence to a unique result despite of the randomness of the discrete eigenenergies .    in order to find differences between the two results of fig .",
    "2a one has to present them in a different way , as is done in fig .",
    "there one sees that the agreement is extremely good up to about 30 mev and thus one can consider the lit for @xmath63 mev to be already converged in this energy range with only very few basis functions . beyond 30 mev",
    "the lit is not yet converged with @xmath59 and starts oscillating about the lit with @xmath65 with differences becoming even greater than 5% . because of this regular oscillations about the more precise result it should even not lead to serious inversion problems as long the response does not contain any specific structure at higher energies .",
    "if one wants to check the existence of such structures one should improve the precision of the calculation by enlarging the basis .",
    "in fact with larger @xmath28 values of 20 , 30 , and 40 one finds an increased high - precision range with relative differences compared to the case with @xmath65 of less than 0.5% up to about 50 , 60 , and 85 mev , respectively .",
    "however , in order to search for possible structures it is not the proper strategy to just enlarge the basis .",
    "one has to consider that a resonance with a width considerably smaller than @xmath10 is smoothed out in the lit such that the details of the shape are hidden in tiny contributions to the transform . to disentangle the details",
    "one should reduce @xmath10 increasing in this way the energy resolution of the lit .",
    "the situation for smaller values of @xmath10 is illustrated in fig .  3 , where lit results are shown up to about pion threshold for @xmath66 , 1 , 2.5 , and 10 mev and for various values of @xmath28 .",
    "for the smallest value , @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "3a ) , one finds isolated lorentzian peaks . in case of @xmath66 mev",
    "they appear already at low energy , for @xmath67 mev at somewhat higher energy , and for @xmath68 mev at even higher energy . since the density of lit states grows with growing @xmath28 ( see other panels of fig .",
    "3 ) isolated peaks are pushed to higher and higher energies if @xmath28 is increased .",
    "in addition one notes that any decrease of @xmath10 , @xmath69 any increase of the resolution , shrinks the convergence range for a given value of @xmath28 . for the smallest @xmath10 value of 0.1 mev",
    "a rather strong oscillatory behavior is still present at very low energies even with @xmath65 . in order to get a smooth and",
    "converged lit also in this case one would need to increase @xmath28 considerably .     of the @xmath4 channel with @xmath66 , 1 , 2.5 , and 10 mev in all four panels ( @xmath61 fm ) , but different @xmath28 values in the various panels :",
    "10 ( a ) , 20 ( b ) , 30 ( c ) , and 50 ( d).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    for a reliable inversion of @xmath11 the transform has to be sufficiently converged for a given @xmath10 . in particular isolated peaks of single lorentzians should not appear , @xmath69 for any @xmath70 value one should have a significant contribution from more than one lorentzian . of course , for the present two - body case one could increase @xmath28 further without greater problems , but in a general many - body calculation this might not be easily possible . on the other hand",
    "it is not necessary to work with a single @xmath10 value only .",
    "considering again the lit results of fig .  3 with",
    "@xmath65 one sees that for @xmath67 mev a rather converged result is obtained up to about 10 mev .",
    "thus structures of a relatively small width would leave a visible signal in the transform in this energy range .",
    "in fact one can use this lit in the low - energy range and combine it with a lit with a larger @xmath10 for higher energies . in general one can proceed as follows , one defines a new transform @xmath71 in an interval @xmath72 $ ] by combining @xmath73 transforms @xmath74 such that only the lit with the specific @xmath75 enters significantly in the energy range @xmath76 $ ] : @xmath77 the function @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ lit_mult ] ) is a smooth cutoff from 1 to 0 at @xmath79 , for example @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where one has to take reasonable values for the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath84 in eq .  ( [ lit_mult ] )",
    "can be chosen such that size of the transform does not change too drastically from one energy range to the next .",
    "thus , for the case of the lits of fig .  3 with @xmath65 , one could set @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 mev with @xmath88 and @xmath89 mev . in order to improve the precision in the threshold region",
    "even further one could include the case with @xmath66 mev , but one would need to further increase @xmath28 . alternatively , keeping @xmath65 , one could check the convergence behavior of a lit with a somewhat larger @xmath10 , for example @xmath90 mev .",
    "the discussion above shows that the lit is an approach with a controlled resolution . in an actual calculation",
    "one should check which is the lowest @xmath10 that leads in a specific energy range to a sufficiently converged and smooth lit without that a single lit state sticks out .",
    "structures which are considerably smaller than such a @xmath10 value can not be resolved by the inversion .",
    "a helpful criterion is given in @xcite ( see discussion of fig .  7 in @xcite ) .",
    "the isoscalar monopole response function @xmath91 can be determined in inclusive electron scattering ( @xmath92 and @xmath26 represent momentum and energy transferred by the virtual photon to the nucleus ) . in this case",
    "the transition operator @xmath24 of eq .",
    "( [ response ] ) becomes @xmath92-dependent and takes the form @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the nucleon isoscalar electric form factor , @xmath95 is the position of nucleon @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is the spherical bessel function of 0@xmath98 order .",
    "experimental investigations of the @xmath0he@xmath2 reaction in @xcite revealed a @xmath3 resonance located less than 1 mev above the @xmath0he break - up threshold with quite a narrow width of about 250 kev .",
    "it is interesting to note that very recently a eihh - lit calculation was carried out , where it is pointed out that the resonance might be interpreted as a breathing mode @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this and the preceding eihh - lit calculations  @xcite were only able to determine a resonance strength but not a resonance width since the density of lit states in the resonance region was too low . on the other hand , with the experience made in the previous section it seems to be easy to increase the density of lit states also in the region of the @xmath0he isoscalar monopole resonance , namely by increasing the number of hh basis states .",
    "unfortunately with an hh expansion this does not work very well in the energy region below the three - body break - up threshold . to illustrate this , the first lit application  @xcite ,",
    "already mentioned in the introduction , is considered in the following .",
    "the calculation was carried out for inclusive electron scattering off @xmath0he and used a correlated hh ( chh ) basis , where nn short range correlations are introduced to accelerate the convergence of the hh expansion . the nn interaction ( tn potential ,",
    "coulomb force included ) consisted in a central spin - dependent interaction active only in even nn partial waves . in fig .",
    "4 we show an unpublished result for the lit of the response function @xmath73 from this calculation .",
    "one sees that there is only an isolated lit state in the resonance region . in this specific case",
    "one finds the next lit state only about 0.1 mev below the four - body break - up threshold at @xmath99 mev . on the contrary for positive values of @xmath70 one",
    "has quite a high density of lit states .",
    "an increase of the number of hyperspherical and/or hyperradial basis states does not change the general picture of having only very few lit states for negative @xmath70 values , as in fact it was the case in the lit - eihh calculations  @xcite .",
    "in addition it was checked for the present work that an increase of the parameter @xmath58 in the hyperradial functions ( @xmath100 in the four - body chh calculation of @xcite does not lead to any significant change concerning the low - energy density of lit states .",
    "of @xmath101 at @xmath102 mev / c ( tn potential ) of @xmath0he with four - body chh basis from  @xcite.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    at first sight it is not understandable why an increase of the hh basis states does not have a significant effect on the density of lit states in the energy range below the three - body break - up threshold . on the other hand one has to consider that the dynamical variable for a two - body break - up , @xmath69 the relative vector @xmath103 between the free nucleon and the bound three - body system , does not appear explicitly in the hh formalism",
    ". therefore it might be helpful to use a different basis , where @xmath104 is taken into account as variable explicitly . in the following ,",
    "the four - body calculation is switched to such a basis .",
    "the new basis states consist in a product of a three - body chh basis state for the first three nucleons times a single - particle basis state for the fourth nucleon .",
    "the chh basis state is then again a product of a hyperspherical basis state @xmath105}(\\omega)$ ] times a hyperradial basis state @xmath106 , where the former depends on the grand - angle @xmath107 and is characterized by the grand - angular quantum number @xmath108 and a set of other quantum numbers @xmath109 $ ] , whereas the latter is proportional to @xmath110 ( for a detailed definition of the hh basis see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the single - particle states are defined as follows @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the orbital angular momentum , spin , and isospin quantum numbers , respectively , and @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 denote the corresponding projections",
    ". the radial wave function @xmath118 is given by @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the nn correlation function ( same correlation as in chh basis ) .",
    "the chh basis provides antisymmetric states for the first three nucleons , whereas the product of the chh basis states and the single - particle states has to be antisymmetrized in order to have totally antisymmetric basis states for all four particles . in order to calculate the @xmath0he ground state or the transitions induced by the action of the operator @xmath121 of eq .",
    "( [ monopole ] ) on the @xmath0he ground state one has to couple the chh basis states with those of eq .",
    "( [ basis ] ) to a total angular momentum @xmath122 equal to zero , and also the total spin ( isospin ) wave function of the four nucleons has to be coupled to a total spin @xmath14 ( isospin @xmath71 ) equal to zero .",
    "the calculations described in the following proceed in the same way as it was carried out in @xcite , namely by using a nine - dimensional monte carlo integration for the evaluation of the various hamiltonian and norm matrix elements .",
    "such an approach leads to reliable results ( see benchmark test  @xcite ) .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ tab : be1 ] the convergence of the @xmath0he binding energy is illustrated .",
    "it is evident that the dominant contribution comes from the basis functions where the three - body chh basis is in a symmetric state and the relative angular momentum @xmath112 of the single - particle motion is equal to zero .",
    "mixed symmetric chh states together with @xmath125 enhance the binding energy by about 0.5 mev .",
    "the contribution of states with @xmath124 is very small and leads to a further increase of about 0.1 mev ( antisymmetric chh states have been neglected ) .",
    "the final result of 31.41(5 ) mev agrees very well with the converged result of the four - body chh calculation of 31.40(5 ) mev .    for the calculation of the lit of the @xmath0he",
    "isoscalar monopole response function @xmath101 hyperradial and radial basis states are chosen with a rather large extension in space .",
    "this should lead to a sufficiently high density of lit states at low energy ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the following choice is made : @xmath126 fm ( hyperradial chh states ) and @xmath127 fm ( radial single - particle states ) .",
    "for the hyperradial part 15 basis functions are taken , whereas the number of the radial single - particle basis states is kept variable and denoted by @xmath128 .",
    "since the main interest of this investigation is concentrated on the low - energy part of @xmath101 only those three - body chh basis states which lead to a significant contribution to the @xmath0he binding energy ( see table  [ tab : be1 ] ) are taken into account : symmetric chh states up to @xmath129 and the mixed symmetric chh state with @xmath130 .",
    "all the remaining states contribute only with 0.42 mev to the @xmath0he binding energy .",
    "thus it is reasonable to expect also a shift of the position of the @xmath0he @xmath3 resonance by about 0.5 mev towards higher energies with respect to the four - body chh calculation of fig .  4 leading to a value of about -5.9 mev .",
    "to take into account only four hyperspherical three - body chh states reduces the numerical effort of the calculation quite a bit , but even with such a reduced basis the calculation requests a considerable numerical effort ( note that due to the rather weak fall - off of the hyperradial / radial basis functions the relevant integration volume becomes much larger than for the bound - state calculation ) .",

    "the energy distribution of lit states is shown up to the four - body break - up threshold with three different @xmath128 values . as it has been anticipated the density of lit states increases with a growing number of radial single - particle states . due to the interplay of chh basis states and",
    "radial single - particle basis states the pattern is not as regular as in the two - body example of fig  1 .",
    "it is obvious that a further increase of @xmath128 would lead to an even higher density of low - energy lit states , but , unfortunately , the precision of the nine - dimensional monte carlo integration is not sufficiently high and a solution with @xmath132 becomes problematic . in this respect",
    "it is a drawback to work with a correlated hh basis because one looses the orthogonality .",
    "nonetheless , as shown in the following , the present calculation allows a determination of the width of the @xmath0he isoscalar monopole resonance .    in fig .",
    "6 the lit of @xmath101 is shown for @xmath133 and @xmath134 . in the latter case",
    "the basis function with @xmath135 ( see eq .",
    "( [ rel_r ] ) ) is dropped because it makes the numerical solution of the corresponding eigenvalue problem problematic ( precision of hamiltonian and norm matrices is not sufficiently high ) .",
    "the figure illustrates that with increasing resolution , @xmath69 with decreasing @xmath10 the resonance becomes more and more pronounced against the background .",
    "one also finds that the anticipated peak position of about -5.9 mev is roughly confirmed .    in order to determine a resonance width",
    "the lit has to be inverted .",
    "the procedure of the inversion in presence of a resonance is described in @xcite . as rule of thumb",
    "one can say that the chosen @xmath10 should not be much larger than the resonance width .",
    "however , in principle , if the lit is calculated with a very high precision one can choose also a considerably larger @xmath10 .",
    "in fact in the model study @xcite it is nicely demonstrated that the obtained width is independent from the used @xmath10 over a very large range , even with @xmath136 mev the shape of a resonance with a width of 270 kev was exactly determined . in the present case",
    "the precision of the calculated lit is not as high as in @xcite .",
    "the actual inversion was made with two different @xmath10 values ( see discussion of transform @xmath71 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ lit_mult ] ) ) , @xmath137 mev beyond -4 mev , whereas @xmath138 was varied in the range from 0.1 to 0.5 mev in the low - energy region .",
    "the various results for the width were quite stable ( maximal difference : 0.01 mev ) and lead to the following values : 120(10 ) kev ( @xmath133 ) and 240 kev ( @xmath139 , the mean value amounts to 180(70 ) kev .",
    "the result lies in the same ballpark as the experimental value of 270(50 ) kev @xcite .",
    "one could try to increase the theoretical precision of the determination of the width by a further increase of @xmath128 . because of the problem just mentioned above this would require a non negligible effort in the present calculation .",
    "on the other hand it is much more desirable to make such a calculation with a realistic nuclear force instead of having a very precise result for a simple nn interaction like the tn potential model .",
    "for the inversion of the lit it is assumed that there is only a single peak in the resonance region . in principle from an increase of the precision of the calculation one could also find out that the resonance has a more complicated structure , for example a double peak .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "6 that in the present calculation one controls the resonance with a resolution of about 100 kev , thus it is not possible to resolve structures with an even smaller width .",
    "the situation is similar to experiment , where one works with a given resolution of the experimental apparatus .",
    "of @xmath101 at @xmath140 mev / c ( tn potential ) of @xmath0he with @xmath141 , 0.1 , 0.25 , 1 , and 5 mev calculated with the new basis states ( three - body chh basis times single - particle basis of eqs .",
    "( [ basis],[rel_r ] ) ) ; in ( a ) the single - particle basis with 20 and in ( b ) with 21 states ( see text).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in this work first a brief outline of the lit approach is given , a method that allows to calculate continuum observables with bound - state techniques . in a next step the energy resolution that can be obtained with the method",
    "is discussed . to this end a specific channel of the final state in deuteron photodisintegration is studied in unretarded dipole approximation . in order to do so the lit equation is solved using a bound - state basis to calculate the relevant quantities .",
    "it is shown how the spatial extension and the number of basis states affects the calculation .",
    "the role of the width parameter @xmath10 of the lit is discussed , especially which @xmath10 values should be chosen in a specific situation .",
    "the discussion makes clear that the lit constitutes an approach with a controlled resolution .",
    "in particular it allows to determine the width of narrow resonances in the continuum .",
    "however , for lit calculation with an arbitrary many - body bound - state basis this is not always guaranteed . usually narrow resonances of an @xmath38-body system in the continuum are located below the three - body break - up threshold .",
    "if one intends to study the resonance in a scattering state calculation it is mandatory to take into account the relevant _ dynamical _ variable , @xmath69 the relative vector between the two fragments . in spite of the lit bound - state character this _ dynamical _ variable",
    "should also appear explicitly in a lit calculation .",
    "it guarantees that the density of lit states can be enhanced in the resonance region by increasing the number of those basis states that directly depend on the _ dynamical _ variable . on the contrary , if this variable is not included explicitly , as for example in an @xmath38-body hh calculation , it is difficult , maybe even impossible , to obtain a detailed information about the resonance .    in a general case of a resonance with various open channels",
    "the resonance can have a _ partial _ decay width to all these channels , which then results in a _",
    "decay width . in this case",
    "it is sufficient to choose just one of the various possible _ dynamical _ variables .",
    "the only aim which has to be fulfilled is a sufficient density of lit states .",
    "the lit then by definition collects strength from all open channels and a determination of the width via inversion leads to the _ total _ width .    in order to illustrate the situation in greater detail the isoscalar monopole response function @xmath73 of @xmath0he is considered as test case using a simple spin - dependent central nn interaction ( coulomb force is included ) .",
    "in fact , here one finds a narrow resonance in the continuum below the three - body break - up threshold .",
    "obviously , in this case the _ dynamical _ variable is given by the relative vector of the free nucleon and the bound three - nucleon system .",
    "using a proper basis as described above it is indeed found that the density of lit states grows in the resonance region if the number of single - particle basis states is enhanced .",
    "it is shown that the lit state density becomes sufficiently high to determinate the resonance width via an inversion of the transform .",
    "in fact , a width of 180(70 ) kev is found , a result that is not too far from the experimental value of 270(50 ) kev",
    ". it would be very interesting to perform such a calculation also with modern realistic nuclear forces as have been used in the lit - eihh calculations of the response function @xmath73@xcite , however the effective interaction approach has to be a bit redesigned , since one would not have any more a pure hh basis .",
    "the present approach is not only advantageous in case of cross sections with narrow resonances , but also for non - resonant two - body break - up cross sections at very low energies .",
    "the possibility to increase the lit state density allows to work with smaller @xmath10 values thus enhancing the energy resolution of the calculation",
    ". this might be particularly interesting in case of astrophysical reactions .",
