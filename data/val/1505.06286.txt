    "due to the advance of the web 2.0 techniques , various kinds of websites have become parts of our life .",
    "most people nowadays are used to sharing , seeking and obtaining information , and interacting with others through various social networking websites such as digg , slashdot , facebook , and twitter , to name a few . as",
    "more and more people join these social websites , the phenomenon of immense quantity of information flow and influence spread becomes prominent .",
    "this then motivates the utilization of this phenomenon , known as the `` word - of - mouth '' effect , to bring significant potential benefits in many types of business such as viral marketing and innovation promotion .",
    "for example , a company can effectively promote its brand and new products by involving a group of influential people spreading the good words over social websites .",
    "hence , in very recent years , there is active research @xcite exploring the problem of influence maximization .",
    "existing works studied the influence maximization problem generally based on two kinds of diffusion models , the linear threshold ( lt ) and the independent cascade ( ic ) models . in the lt model ,",
    "the influence strength between a pair of individuals is modeled as a fixed weight , and the influence on an individual is described as cumulative .",
    "an individual is activated when the sum of the weights propagated from his / her activated neighbors exceeds his / her own threshold .",
    "the ic model assumes that each influence of one to another is an independent chance to activate the latter with a probability . on both models",
    ", the problem of influence maximization aims at identifying a proper group ( of a specified size ) of individuals as seeds to have the number of activated people maximized",
    ". however , note that such influence maximization problems have not taken into account the monetary aspect , which usually plays a crucial factor in people s purchase decisions .",
    "that is , maximizing the influence spread does not necessarily bring maximum revenue , as an individual may be very interested in a new smartphone , but does not purchase the smartphone due to its high price .    according to the studies in the fields of social psychology @xcite and economics @xcite , one s valuation towards a commodity",
    "will be positively influenced by those that have purchased the commodity , which is known as the herd mentality or positive network externalities .",
    "in other words , people tend to imitate others in their consumer behaviors , which will result in irrational valuations of the commodity , i.e. , higher valuations beyond their inherent valuations . based on these phenomena , mirrokni et al .",
    "@xcite addressed the * revenue maximization * problem by incorporating the monetary concept into the maximization problem of influence spread based on the lt model . in the monetary lt model , the influence strength ( or said weight )",
    "is transformed into the valuation concept , and the individual threshold is regarded as the inherent valuation .",
    "one s valuation of a commodity is thus the sum of his / her inherent valuation and the valuation increment from social influences .",
    "an individual then pays for a commodity and propagates his / her influence whenever her / his valuation is larger than or equal to the pricing of the commodity .",
    "consider the network shown in figure [ fig : ex ] as an example , where the number contained in each node is the inherent valuation and the number on an edge from one node to another is the weight , i.e. , the influence strength . for the ease of illustration , without loss of generality , the function @xmath0 is used to transform the effects of the social influences cumulated on an individual into the valuation concept in this example . if @xmath1 purchases the commodity , @xmath2 s valuation is increased to @xmath3 . if @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath1 all purchase the commodity , the valuation increment for @xmath2 is @xmath6 and @xmath2 s valuation thus becomes @xmath7 .",
    "the objective of the revenue maximization problem thus aims at determining the pricing of the commodity and identifying a seed group of individuals for promotion so that the total revenue is maximized .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , none of the existing works has taken a quantity constraint on commodities into account .",
    "note that due to the consideration of marketing strategies or practical conditions , quantities of commodities are often constrained in the real world .",
    "for example , the scarcity fallacy usually makes commodities more desirable @xcite , as a company may want to release limited edition commodities to boost customer desire .",
    "another example is the case of promoting a concert , where the quantity of the concert tickets is constrained by the number of available seats . in this case ,",
    "due to the schedules of the musicians or singers , it is hard to add more shows and the total number of concert tickets .",
    "hence , selecting seeds to receive free commodities will reduce the quantities of commodities that can be sold .",
    "this makes the prior works unapplicable to determine the proper pricing and obtain maximum revenue .",
    "for example , suppose that the network shown in figure  [ fig : ex ] is considered , where the diffusion model with the monetary concept in the work @xcite is adopted and the function @xmath0 is used to transform the effects of the social influence into the valuation concept . without consideration of the commodity quantity ,",
    "the maximum revenue is @xmath8 obtained at the pricing of @xmath9 with the seed group @xmath10 . with the influence from @xmath10 , @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "are the first to purchase the commodity , since both their valuations @xmath11 are equal to the pricing of @xmath9 .",
    "then , @xmath12 and @xmath2 will subsequently purchase the commodity due to their valuations @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "however , if the quantity of commodities is limited to 4 , the revenue will decrease to @xmath15 since two free commodities given to the seeds @xmath16 and @xmath1 should be taken off first . in this case , letting the commodity be priced at @xmath17 and choosing only @xmath16 as the seed will be the best . under the influence of @xmath16",
    ", @xmath4 first purchases the commodity since its valuation @xmath11 is larger than the pricing of @xmath17 .",
    "then , both @xmath12 and @xmath2 purchase the commodities due to their valuations @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "finally , since @xmath4 , @xmath12 , and @xmath2 all pay for the commodity sold at the price of @xmath17 , the maximum revenue is @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , when the quantity of commodities is limited , we argue the need of new approaches for the revenue maximization problem .",

    ", we investigate this problem on the monetary - concept incorporated lt - model @xcite , and propose algorithm prub ( pricing searching strategy using revenue upper bound ) to derive the optimal solutions .",
    "then , we further revise prub to propose a heuristic algorithm prub+if ( pricing searching strategy using revenue upper bound with importance feedback ) for better efficiency . experiments on real social networks show the good effectiveness of prub and prub+if , demonstrating the revenue maximization with and without a quantity constraint differs from each other .    in summary ,",
    "the contributions of this paper are :    1 .   we are the first to address the general case of the revenue maximization problem .",
    "note that the previous work of the revenue maximization without a quantity constraint is a special case of our problem with the quantity set as the total number of individuals on the social network .",

    "note even in the case without a commodity constraint , the proposed approach outperforms the state of the art approach that incorporates the monetary concept @xcite .",
    "to formulate the revenue maximization problem , in this section , we first describe the social network with the monetary concept , then explain how the social influences propagate over the network using the monetary - concept incorporated lt - model @xcite , and finally define the revenue and the revenue maximization problem formally .    given a commodity , a social network with the monetary concept , referred to as a * monetizing social network * ,",
    "is a weighted digraph @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the set of individuals and for each individual @xmath29 , his / her inherent valuation @xmath30 is carried in @xmath31 .",
    "usually , the valuation information @xmath31 can be estimated and learned from questionnaires or historical sales data , with regard to the commodity @xcite . for any individuals",
    "@xmath32 , if @xmath33 s purchase will directly encourage @xmath34 s desire for the commodity , an edge from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , denoted as @xmath35 ( @xmath36 standing for the edge set ) , represents the existance of the influence , and @xmath37 represents the influence strength as the weight on @xmath38 . adopting the concave graph model in the work @xcite",
    ", we consider a non - negative , non - decreasing , and concave function @xmath39 with @xmath40 to transform the weights into the valuation concept .",
    "that is , given a set of individuals @xmath41 directly exerting influences on an individual @xmath34 , @xmath34 s valuation towards a commodity will become @xmath42 .",
    "based on the monetary - concept incorporated lt - model @xcite , the propagation of social influences over the monetizing social network happens whenever individuals _ adopt _ the commodity .",
    "an individual _ adopts _ the commodity if and only if 1 ) the pricing of the commodity is less than or equal to his / her valuation , or 2 ) this individual is an initial customer receiving a freebie .",
    "after an individual adopts the commodity , he / she will then exert influences on his / her out - neighbors to encourage them and raise their valuations for adoption .",
    "the following shows an example of social influences propagating over the monetizing social network .",
    "[ ex : ex1 ] given the monetizing social network in figure  [ fig : ex ] and the concave influence function @xmath0 , consider the promotion of a concert .",
    "suppose that the pricing of the concert tickets is @xmath9 and the seed group is @xmath43 . influenced by @xmath16 , the valuations of @xmath4 , @xmath12 , and @xmath1 are increased by @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the valuations of @xmath4 , @xmath12 and @xmath1 thus become @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , respectively .",

    "after that , as no other individuals adopt the concert ticket , the influence propagation stops .",
    "consequently , under @xmath16 s influence , @xmath4 will also adopt the concert ticket , and the valuations of @xmath12 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 become @xmath17 , @xmath17 , and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "consider another example of the seed group @xmath52 . under the influence of @xmath16 and @xmath1 ,",

    "( here @xmath16 s influence on @xmath1 is neglected since @xmath1 as an initial customer has already adopted the concert ticket . )",

    "9999    here we define that the revenue comes from the number of people paying for the commodity and the pricing of the commodity .",
    "recall example  [ ex : ex1 ] where the pricing is @xmath9 and the seed group is @xmath10 , and suppose that the quantity of the concert tickets is 4 .",
    "the revenue is @xmath55 , since two concert tickets are used as free tickets given to @xmath16 and @xmath1 , and only two concert tickets are left for sale ( even though @xmath4 , @xmath12 , @xmath2 , and @xmath5 all want to purchase these concert tickets ) .",
    "formally , given the quantity of commodities @xmath56 , the pricing @xmath57 of the commodity , and the seed group @xmath58 , the revenue is defined as follows .",
    "* revenue function .",
    "* given the quantity @xmath56 , the revenue at the pricing of @xmath57 with the seed group @xmath58 is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the set of individuals adopting the commodity under the influences of @xmath58 .",
    "to increase the revenue , finding the proper pricing @xmath57 and identifying a proper seed group @xmath58 is important .",
    "consider the same setting mentioned above , but with an empty seed group and the pricing set as @xmath61 .",
    "the revenue is @xmath62 , which is less than @xmath63 .",
    "since any company will expect to earn as higher revenue as possible given a fixed amount of commodities , in this paper , we are interested in looking for such pricing and a seed group as initial customers that can bring maximum revenue .",
    "the proposed problem is formally defined as follows .",
    "* the rm@xmath64 problem : revenue maximization with a quantity constraint . * given a monetizing social network @xmath27 , a set of input prices @xmath65 , and a quantity of commodities @xmath56 , the problem is to determine the pricing @xmath66 of the commodity and find a seed group @xmath67 as initial customers , where @xmath68 , such that the revenue @xmath69 is maximized , i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "note that the revenue function @xmath69 is not single - peaked with respect to the pricing , which means the approaches such as the binary search and the gradient decent search are not applicable to finding out the optimal pricing .",
    "for example , following the setting of example  [ ex : ex1 ] and letting the quantity of the concert tickets be 4 , we obtain the highest revenue at pricing of @xmath17 , @xmath9 , and @xmath71 as @xmath20 , @xmath15 , and @xmath72 , respectively ( with the seed groups @xmath73 , @xmath10 , and @xmath74 , accordingly ) .",
    "obviously , with respect to the pricing , @xmath69 is not single - peaked .",
    "furthermore , the rm@xmath64 problem can be proved to be np - hard . to show this",
    ", we first introduce a special case of rm@xmath64 , and then prove that this special case is np - hard .",
    "as the special case is np - hard , rm@xmath64 is thus np - hard .",
    "* specialrm .",
    "* this problem is a special case of rm@xmath75 , and asks for only one input price and a sufficient quantity of commodities for the population .",

    "[ theo : np ] the problem of specialrm is np - hard .",

    "if there exists a minimum set @xmath58 that maximizes the revenue , we can obtain another set @xmath88 . then , it can be shown that @xmath89 is the minimum vertex cover of @xmath90 since @xmath91 theorem  [ theo : np ] is thus proved .",
    "in this section , for the revenue maximization problem , we first propose algorithm prub ( pricing searching strategy using revenue upper bound ) that is able to derive the optimal solutions .",
    "note that finding the optimal pair of @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the revenue maximization problem is exhausted .",
    "then , for better efficiency , a heuristic algorithm prub+if ( prub with importance feedback ) is introduced following the framework of prub .      to tackle the rm@xmath64 problem ,",
    "algorithm prub is designed to obtain the optimal solutions . as mentioned previously ,",
    "finding a proper pair of pricing and seed group is critical in this problem , since the revenue comes from the pricing of the commodity and the number of people paying for the commodity .",
    "a nave approach for finding the optimal pair of pricing @xmath92 and seed group @xmath93 is to search at all @xmath94 , enumerate all seed groups @xmath58 , and calculate the corresponding revenue @xmath69 .",
    "the rationale of algorithm prub is based on this nave approach and prunes the search space by 1 ) progressively filtering out non - candidate pricing and 2 ) deriving an upper bound of the size of seed groups for each price .",
    "we illustrate the two ideas of pruning in the following .",
    "* non - candidate pricing filtering . *",
    "the first idea is to prune the searching on non - candidate pricing .",
    "motivated by the concern of only maximum revenue , this pruning derives an upper bound of maximum revenue at each price , and utilizes an achievable global revenue @xmath95 that records the maximum revenue discovered so far to progressively filter out the pricing that will not result in higher revenue",
    ". that is , if an upper bound of maximum revenue at each price can be derived , prub then does not need to seek the seed group for maximum revenue at a specific price when the upper bound at this price is less than or equal to @xmath95 . when @xmath95 is updated and increased progressively after the successful searching of the seed group at each price , the non - candidate pricing is also progressively detected and filtered out .    in order to infer the upper bound of maximum revenue at a specific price",
    ", the maximum number of individuals who have potential for adopting the commodity at this price is needed . to find out whether or not an individual has this potential , it needs to estimate the valuation of the individual .",
    "therefore , in the following , we first introduce the definitions of _ maximum valuations _ and _ potential buyers _ for defining the upper bound of maximum revenue .",
    "* maximum valuation . *",
    "the maximum valuation of an individual @xmath34 is the valuation under the influences from all @xmath34 s in - neighbors , which is denoted as @xmath96    * potential buyer .",
    "* an individual @xmath34 is regarded as a potential buyer at a specific price @xmath57 if @xmath34 has potential for adopting the commodity at @xmath57 , i.e. , @xmath97 .    *",
    "upper bound of maximum revenue . * given a quantity constraint @xmath56 , the upper bound of maximum revenue at a price @xmath57 is @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the number of potential buyers at @xmath57 , i.e. , @xmath100 given the monetizing social network in figure [ fig : ex ] , the concave influence function @xmath0 , and a set of input prices @xmath101 , consider the promotion of a concert .",
    "table  [ t : maximalbudgets ] shows the maximum valuation of each individual .",
    "suppose the quantity of the concert tickets is set as 4 .",
    "the corresponding upper bounds of maximum revenue for all prices are listed in table  [ t : maximalrevenues ] .",
    "9999    in addition , to have better effectiveness of pruning by utilizing the upper bound of maximum revenue , prub searches the prices in a descending order of the upper bounds .",
    "then , once prub discovers a price , at which the upper bound is less than or equal to the achievable global revenue @xmath95 , the searching for the following prices ( including the current price ) can be ignored .",
    "therefore , in the above example , prub will start the examination of the prices from @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and so on .",
    "* bound of seed group s size . * the second idea for pruning search space is to avoid enumerating useless seed groups under a specific price .",
    "the inspiration is , under the consideration of a specific price @xmath57 , it involves more than @xmath106 quantities of commodities to be sold for finding the revenue higher than the achievable global revenue @xmath95 obtained so far . when considering the price @xmath57 , algorithm prub then bounds the size of the seed groups as @xmath107 since the quantity of commodities is limited .",
    "follow example  [ ex : framework ] , and suppose the achievable global revenue @xmath108 . in order to find the revenue higher than @xmath109 ,",
    "when searching at the price @xmath102 , prub expects more than @xmath110 concert tickets left for sale and enumerates only the seed groups of sizes less than or equal to 2 ( since the quantity of the concert tickets is set as 4 ) .",
    "the searching on the seed groups of sizes 3 and 4 is thus pruned .",
    "note that incorporating the two pruning methods is satisfactory to the accuracy .",
    "therefore , algorithm prub is still able to derive the optimal solutions , even though the search space is reduced .",
    "the details of prub are presented in algorithm  [ algo : framework ] . in the following , we show an example to illustrate how prub figures out the optimal pair of @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "[ algo : framework ]    @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 derive @xmath114 for all @xmath115 sort all @xmath94 descendingly by @xmath114 [ code : fram : search1 ]    [ ex : exprub ] follow example  [ ex : framework ] , and initialize @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath95 as @xmath116 , an empty set , and @xmath116 , respectively . according to the upper bounds of maximum revenue in table  [ t : maximalrevenues ] , prub will consider the prices in the following order : @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and so on .",
    "beginning from the price @xmath9 , prub checks whether or not @xmath117 . since @xmath118 , prub looks for the maximum revenue at the price @xmath9 by enumerating all the seed groups whose size is bounded by equation  ( [ e : abound ] ) ( including the size 0 ) .",
    "first , for the empty seed group , no individual adopts the concert ticket at @xmath9 .",
    "so prub goes to the size 1 .",
    "then , prub lists all the seed groups of size 1 since @xmath119 . among all the seed groups of size 1",
    ", prub finds the highest revenue @xmath120 ( referred to example  [ ex : ex1 ] ) .",
    "as @xmath9 is higher than @xmath121 , prub updates @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 . before seeking the seed groups of size 2 for maximum revenue",
    ", prub ensures @xmath125 .",
    "after all seed groups of size 2 are enumerated , the highest revenue @xmath63 is found ( referred to example  [ ex : ex1 ] ) . because @xmath126 , prub updates @xmath122 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 .",
    "later , note that @xmath129 .",
    "the searching for the maximum revenue at the price @xmath9 stops .",
    "the next price considered is @xmath17 .",
    "a similar process is performed until prub finds such a price @xmath57 that @xmath130 . in the end , the maximum revenue is @xmath131 , where the pair of @xmath132 and @xmath133 is the optimal solution .",
    "9999    [ theo : complexity ] the time complexity of prub is @xmath134 .",
    "we first show that prub costs @xmath135 time at a specific price for searching the maximum revenue .",
    "given the quantity of commodities @xmath56 , the largest size of the seed group is @xmath56 . in total , there are thus @xmath136 seed groups . for a seed group of size @xmath137 , there are @xmath137 seeds exerting influences on the other o(@xmath138 ) individuals that are not seeds . due to the influence cascade ,",
    "it costs o(@xmath139 ) time to figure out the influence spread of a seed group of size @xmath137 . therefore , the total time complexity for searching the maximum revenue by enumerating seed groups is @xmath140 as searching at a price costs @xmath135 , the total time complexity of prub is thus @xmath134 .",
    "theorem  [ theo : complexity ] is proved .",
    "note that the high complexity of algorithm prub indicates the poor scalability of the optimal algorithm for real social networks which are usually large .",
    "therefore , in the following subsection , we propose a heuristic based on the framework of prub to obtain the feasible solutions on larger instances .      in this section",
    ", the heuristic algorithm prub+if ( prub with importance feedback ) is proposed as a feasible solution .",
    "the heuristic prub+if differs from prub at the way of finding the most proper seed group at each price . following the framework of prub",
    ", prub+if introduces the concept of _ pricing - sensitive importance _ , accompanying the contribution feedback from the out - neighbors , for selecting seeds in a heuristic manner , instead of listing all seed groups .",
    "the main idea of prub+if is that , an individual with greater potential for making others adopt the commodity should be regarded as more important . selecting the most important individuals as seeds greedily is able to lead to a feasible solution .",
    "then , the question is how to evaluate one s potential for making others adopt the commodity .",
    "the intuition is about how many others will be encouraged and how much their valuations can be increased for approaching the pricing , under one s influence .",
    "we then accumulate these effects to calculate one s importance . here",
    "only the effects on potential buyers should be included in the accumulation since only the potential buyers have possibilities of paying for the commodity . in addition , note that the individuals who newly adopt the commodity under one s ( direct and indirect ) influence will further spread their influences to encourage more others in adoption . in order to estimate one s importance more carefully ,",
    "the effects through influence cascades should also be included in the accumulation .",
    "therefore , prub+if introduces the pricing - sensitive importance that sums up the consideration of the normalized weights , the influence propagation , and the potential buyers in the measurement of one s advantage in the commodity promotion at the given pricing .",
    "then , the strategy is to select seeds in accordance with the pricing - sensitive importance .    in the following ,",
    "we introduce the three key points , normalized weight , feedback of influence propagation , and potential - buyer filtering , in measuring the pricing - sensitive importance .",
    "briefly , for each individual @xmath33 , 1 ) the normalized weight is used to evaluate @xmath33 s importance according to @xmath33 s direct effect on another individual @xmath34 s adoption ; 2 ) the feedback of influence propagation is incorporated to evaluate @xmath33 s importance towards @xmath34 by considering also the indirect effects through influence cascades ; 3 ) the potential - buyer filtering is considered to derive @xmath33 s pricing - sensitive importance from accumulating all @xmath33 s direct and indirect effects on all the other potential buyers .    1 .   * normalized weight . * + by intuition , for commodity promotion , an individual @xmath33 s importance towards another individual @xmath34 can be evaluated from how much @xmath34 s valuation approaches the pricing due to @xmath33 s effect .",
    "inspired by this intuition , prub+if calculates the normalized weight @xmath141 , indicating @xmath33 s importance towards @xmath34 s adoption , as follows .",
    "+ & _ uv = & + @xmath142 + where @xmath143 is @xmath34 s valuation of the commodity under the current seed group @xmath58 s effects . in the case of @xmath144 , it means @xmath34 has adopted the commodity .",
    "so the normalized weight @xmath145 , indicating that @xmath33 s importance towards @xmath34 is none due to no impact from @xmath33 on @xmath34 s adoption of the commodity . for the other case , the normalized weight from @xmath33 to @xmath34",
    "is bounded by 1 , and is the portion of @xmath33 s impact on @xmath34 s adoption of the commodity .",

    "* here we use the maximum revenue obtained without consideration of social influences ( nosocial ) , i.e. , the adoption of an individual only depends on his / her inherent valuation , as the baseline , and show the effectiveness of the heuristics in ratios to the baseline .",
    "figure  [ fig : effectiveness ] reports the effectiveness with respect to different ratios of the quantity of commodities to the number of population , i.e. , @xmath198 . for these results , we have two observations as follows . first , on _ digg _ and _ facebook _ with both normal and m - shape valuation distributions , prub+if is the best , and prub+sw outperforms prub+r only in the cases of small @xmath198 .",
    "the reason is that , to estimate the advantage of selecting an individual in the promotion , prub+if introduces the pricing - sensitive importance , which considers the normalized effects of the influence propagated through the social network , while prub+sw only takes the sum of weights on one s direct out - neighbors .",
    "rrub+r picks the seeds blindly .",
    "second , as @xmath198 decreases , the performance of prub+if becomes even more noticeable ( compared to prub+sw and prub+r ) .",

    "<S> recently the influence maximization problem has received much attention for its applications on viral marketing and product promotions . however , </S>",
    "<S> such influence maximization problems have not taken into account the monetary effect on the purchasing decision of individuals . to fulfill this gap , in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we aim for maximizing the revenue by considering the quantity constraint on the promoted commodity . for this problem , </S>",
    "<S> we not only identify a proper small group of individuals as seeds for promotion but also determine the pricing of the commodity . to tackle the revenue maximization problem </S>",
    "<S> , we first introduce a strategic searching algorithm , referred to as algorithm prub , which is able to derive the optimal solutions . </S>",
    "<S> after that , we further modify prub to propose a heuristic , algorithm prub+if , for obtaining feasible solutions more efficiently on larger instances . experiments on real social networks with different valuation distributions demonstrate the effectiveness of prub and prub+if . </S>"
