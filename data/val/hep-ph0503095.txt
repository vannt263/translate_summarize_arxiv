    "similarly , the study of inclusive decays @xmath11 allows for an extraction of @xmath6 with current errors of @xmath12@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the conventional treatment of inclusive @xmath1 decays relies on a local operator product expansion ( ope ) in inverse powers of the large momentum @xmath14 transferred to the hadronic system @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath15 transitions , tight experimental cuts are needed to suppress the overwhelming charm background .",
    "they usually put the kinematics close to the boundary of phase space where the final hadronic system has large energy in the @xmath1-meson rest frame but small invariant mass .",
    "that is , @xmath14 lies close to the light - cone with @xmath16 being much smaller then @xmath17 .",
    "consequently , the ope in local operators breaks down .",
    "the large and small components of @xmath14 can be separated by employing light - cone coordinates .",
    "the local ope can then be replaced by an ope in nonlocal light - cone operators @xcite , which only expands in inverse powers of the remaining large components of @xmath14 .",
    "the leading term in this so - called twist expansion has been known for some time now @xcite .",
    "when going beyond the tree - level approximation the separation of short- and long - distance contributions becomes important and schematically leads to a decay rate of the form @xcite @xmath18 which is factorized into a hard contribution multiplying the convolution of a jet and soft contribution .",
    "the hard , jet , and soft contributions are associated with the different scales @xmath19 .",
    "the matrix elements parametrizing the soft contributions are usually referred to as shape functions .    with the current experimental reach of precision ,",
    "the investigation of subleading twist corrections in @xmath20 has become important .",

    "the factorization into hard , jet , and soft contributions at subleading order in @xmath20 was first worked out by lee and stewart @xcite within the framework of soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) .",
    "they investigated the general structure of subleading corrections , and gave results for decay rates to @xmath21 , including the full triple differential rate in @xmath22 .",

    "@xcite was carried out by beneke et al .",
    "@xcite , too . in all cases , the subleading twist corrections to the differential decay rates",
    "were still given at tree level , mainly due to the increased complexity of the contributions arising beyond that .",
    "in addition , it is usually difficult to assess how far away from their literal expansion region the twist or local expansions are still valid , and where the transition between them occurs .",
    "having a single description for the entire phase space improves this situation . by comparing it with the predictions of the twist or local expansion",
    ", one can systematically investigate where the corrections to the local or twist expansion results become large .    in ref .",

    "the advantage of using qcd rather then hqet light - cone operators is , that it preserves the structure of the light - cone ope , not mixing it with the separate expansion of qcd in hqet .",

    "we follow a different approach and directly incorporate the hadronic variables in the ope , because as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : hadvspart ] , they are better suited for an exact treatment of the phase space in the twist expansion .",
    "usually , the ope is constructed by splitting the @xmath9-quark momentum as @xmath99 to distinguish the conventional definition @xmath100 from ours . ] and expanding in @xmath101 .",
    "instead , we use @xmath102 and expand in @xmath103 .",
    "that is , we shift the residual momentum @xmath103 by @xmath104 compared to the conventional choice @xmath100 .",

    "this corresponds to reexpanding @xmath113 as @xmath116 , which normally does not yield a very good approximation to the local result , since it introduces sizable @xmath117 corrections , which are otherwise absent .",
    "however , this is not an issue in our case , since we are going to treat the complete @xmath118 dependence exactly , as described below . concerning @xmath119 , the contributions proportional to @xmath120 vanish at tree level for a massless final - state quark , the first nonzero term involving @xmath119 being of the form @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , when expanded in the local ope , we effectively only expand the @xmath113 dependence of a certain class of higher order @xmath122 corrections , which should yield a very good approximation .      for the purpose of our discussion",
    "we formulate both local and twist expansion in terms of hadronic variables . in light - cone coordinates , the local ope is obtained by writing @xmath123 and expanding in powers of @xmath124 , where @xmath125 and @xmath103 are treated as @xmath126 we will refer to this as `` local power counting '' .",

    "the twist expansion avoids this breakdown by not expanding the @xmath118 dependence of @xmath14 in @xmath129 .",

    "in particular , the strict application of eq .   leads to an expansion in powers of @xmath131 , including leptonic tensor and phase space , which introduces sizable errors due to neglected higher order terms .",
    "however , we can choose a different approach , such that the twist expansion becomes valid over the entire phase space .",
    "the basic idea is to treat @xmath127 as an exact kinematic variable , i.e. , to not count it as @xmath105 . at the same time we still do not expand in @xmath118 to avoid the breakdown of the local ope . in other words , we only expand in @xmath119 and @xmath132 from the very beginning . to formalize this approach",

    "we perform the light - cone ope to @xmath139 , that is , we obtain the full ope coefficients of any appearing operator with up to two explicit covariant derivatives , which includes all corrections of subleading order in the twist power counting .",
    "the size of an actual term in the expansion , for instance @xmath140 , still depends on the region of phase space , i.e. the size of @xmath125 .",
    "since we do not count @xmath125 in any way , powers of @xmath134 do not correspond to powers of @xmath124 , which is why we use @xmath134 rather then @xmath141 to define the power counting .",

    "on the other hand one could say that the present choice includes more higher order twist corrections , since it keeps them already at the level of the triple differential rate .",

    "[ fig : dgel1 ] . below @xmath597",

    "we note two things .",
    "first , the spectrum on the left shows that the twist expansion breaks down around @xmath599 , and can not be trusted for smaller energies .",
    "secondly , we see again that the higher order twist corrections are important .",
    "interestingly , the variations between the different models are significantly larger for the subleading twist result than for our result .",
    "we already observed a similar but smaller effect in the @xmath530 spectrum .",
    "this suggests that the endpoint spectrum is to a large extent determined by higher order kinematic twist corrections . if this is the case , it would be promising to the @xmath6 extraction from the lepton energy endpoint spectrum , where the shape - function dependence is a limiting factor in the achievable accuracy . to confirm this",
    "one certainly needs to consider a wider spread of model functions .",
    "one could also compute the true subsubleading twist corrections to see if they have an equally large effect on the spectrum or not .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0 corrections to inclusive @xmath1-meson decays , with attention to the radiative decay @xmath3 and the semileptonic decay @xmath2 .",
    "usually , the twist expansion is valid in the shape - function region and the local expansion in the rest of phase space . following ref",
    ".  @xcite we used a modification of the twist expansion which avoids the restriction to the shape - function region and yields an expansion applicable over the full phase space , except for the resonance region .",
    "this effectively provides a smooth interpolation between the otherwise separate regimes of local and twist expansion .",
    "so far , we only worked at tree level",
    ". it would certainly be interesting to see how much of our approach can be carried over to include radiative corrections , at least for the contributions proportional to the leading shape function , since the @xmath600 corrections to the leading twist result are known @xcite . to extend the matching calculation presented here to order @xmath600",
    "one needs to study the renormalization of the relevant light - cone operators in qcd .",
    "the renormalization properties of the shape functions will be different when they are defined via qcd rather then hqet operators . similarly , the @xmath600 corrections to the relations between shape - function moments and the standard hqet parameters will differ between qcd and hqet shape functions .",
    "we performed the expansion directly in qcd light - cone operators and gave a discussion of the general operator basis appearing at tree level , including its parametrization in terms of qcd shape functions .",
    "we used reparametrization invariance under rotations of the light - cone direction to reduce the number of independent shape functions , and showed that the different lepton energy spectra obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite are in agreement .",
    "the results for the various decay distributions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : decayrates ] .",
    "the photon spectrum for @xmath39 is given in eq .  .",
    "the triple differential decay rate for @xmath11 is given in terms of @xmath35 , @xmath127 , and @xmath190 in eq .   and in terms of @xmath35 , @xmath530 , and @xmath88 in eq .  .",
    "except for the resonance region , the decay rates are valid over the entire phase space , being exact to order @xmath0 in the region of hadronic masses @xmath25 , and to order @xmath5 away from it .    employing different shape - function models our results allow to quantify the impact of shape - function effects on decay distributions and partial rates for any desired kinematic cuts .",
    "we stress again , that the shape - function models we used only differ in the third and higher moments of the shape functions , but still give quite different shapes .",
    "the observed variations in the results provide a direct measure of the true shape - function sensitivity of a quantity , i.e. , its sensitivity to the unknown specific form or higher order moments of the shape functions . for the total uncertainty",
    ", one has to additionally vary the local parameters , most notably @xmath506 and @xmath113 , as well , the effect of which should be regarded separately .",
    "an application is to study the transition between the local and twist expansion .",
    "the primary example is the lepton energy spectrum , and we saw that the usual twist expansion can not be trusted below @xmath599 .",
    "we are free to choose any kinematic variables , and discussed several examples of interest .",
    "in particular , we can study decay rates which for given values of the kinematic variables receive contributions from the phase space regions of both local and twist expansion , such as the hadronic energy , or the variable @xmath578 used in the @xmath88-@xmath35 analysis .",
    "the hadronic energy spectrum has not received much attention so far .",

    "<S> we study the @xmath0 corrections from subleading shape functions in inclusive @xmath1-meson decays . we propose a natural and smooth interpolation from the endpoint region to the full phase space , and derive expressions for the triple differential decay rate in @xmath2 and the photon energy spectrum in @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are valid to order @xmath0 for hadronic invariant masses of order @xmath4 and to order @xmath5 for larger hadronic masses . </S>",
    "<S> they allow a systematic investigation of the transition between the separate regimes of the local and nonlocal expansions , and can be used to study decay distributions in any kinematic variables . </S>",
    "<S> we consider several examples of interest and point out that a combined measurement of hadronic energy and invariant mass provides an alternative to the extraction of @xmath6 which is largely independent of shape - function effects and in principle allows a higher accuracy than the combined measurement of leptonic and hadronic invariant masses . </S>",
    "<S> we perform the expansion directly in qcd light - cone operators , and give a discussion of the general basis of light - cone operators . </S>",
    "<S> reparametrization invariance under the change of the light - cone direction reduces the number of independent shape functions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that differing previous results for the lepton energy spectrum obtained from different choices of light - cone coordinates are in agreement . </S>"
