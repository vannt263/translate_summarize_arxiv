    "the dynamics of opinion formation have been studied with growing attention ; in particular in the field of physics @xcite , in which a new research field termed _ sociophysics _ ( going back to the pioneering work of galam _",
    "@xcite ) emerged .",
    "more recently , different kinetic models to describe opinion formation have been proposed @xcite .",
    "such models successfully use methods from statistical mechanics to describe the behaviour of a large number of interacting individuals in a society .",
    "this leads to generalisations of the classical boltzmann equation for gas dynamics .",
    "then the framework from classical kinetic theory for homogeneous gases is adapted to the sociological setting by replacing molecules and their velocities by individuals and their opinion . instead of binary collisions ,",
    "one considers the process of compromise between two individuals .",
    "the basic models typically assume a homogeneous society . to model additional sociologic effects in real societies , e.g.   the influence of strong opinion leaders @xcite",
    ", one needs to consider _ inhomogeneous _ models .",
    "one solution , which arises naturally in certain situations ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , is to consider the time - evolution of distribution functions of different , interacting species .",
    "to some extent this can be seen as the analogue to the physical problem of a mixture of gases , where the molecules of the different gases exchange momentum during collisions @xcite .",
    "this leads to systems of boltzmann - like equations for the opinion distribution functions @xmath0 @xmath1 of @xmath2 interacting species which are of the form @xmath3 the boltzmann - like collision operators @xmath4 describe the change in time of @xmath5 due to binary interaction depending on a balance between the gain and loss of individuals with opinion @xmath6 .",
    "the suitably chosen relaxation times @xmath7 allow to control the interaction frequencies .",
    "to model exchange of individuals ( mass ) between different species , additional collision operators can be present on the right hand side of , which are reminiscent of chemical reactions in the physical situation .    another alternative is to study models where the distribution function depends on an additional variable as e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "this leads to _ inhomogeneous boltzmann - type equations _ for the distribution function @xmath8 which are of the following form @xmath9 clearly , the choice of the field @xmath10 which describes the opinion flux plays a crucial role .",
    "it may not be easy to determine a suitable field from the economic or sociologic problem , in contrast to the physical situation where the law of motion yields the right choice .    in this paper , we give two examples of opinion formation problems , which can be modelled using _",
    "inhomogeneous boltzmann - type equations_. one is concerned with opinion formation where the compromise process depends on the interacting individuals leadership abilities .",
    "the other considers the so - called ` big sort phenomena ' , the clustering of individuals with similar political opinion observed in the usa . both problems lead to an inhomogeneous boltzmann - type equation of the form .",
    "our work is based on a homogeneous kinetic model for opinion formation introduced by toscani in @xcite .",
    "the idea of this kinetic model is to describe the evolution of the distribution of opinion by means of _ microscopic _ interactions among individuals in a society .",
    "opinion is represented as a continuous variable @xmath11 with @xmath12 $ ] , where @xmath13 represent extreme opinions . if concerning political opinions @xmath14 can be identified with the left - right political spectrum .",
    "toscani bases his model on two main aspects of opinion formation .",
    "the first one is a _ compromise process _",
    "@xcite , in which individuals tend to reach a compromise after exchange of opinions",
    ". the second one is _ self - thinking , _ where individuals change their opinion in a diffusive way , possibly influenced by exogenous information sources like the media .",
    "based on both toscani @xcite defines a kinetic model in which opinion is exchanged between individuals through pairwise interactions : when two individuals with pre - interaction opinion @xmath15 and @xmath6 meet , then their post - trade opinions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are given by @xmath18 herein , @xmath19 is the constant _ compromise parameter_. the quantities @xmath20 and @xmath21 are random variables with the same distribution with mean zero and variance @xmath22 .",
    "they model _ self - thinking _ which each individual performs in a random diffusion fashion through an exogenous , global access to information , e.g.  through the press , television or internet . the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 model the local relevance of compromise and self - thinking for a given opinion .",
    "to ensure that post - interaction opinions remain in the interval @xmath14 additional assumptions need to be made on the random variables and the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 , see @xcite for details . in this",
    "setting , the time - evolution of the distribution of opinion among individuals in a simple , homogeneous society is governed by a homogeneous boltzmann - type equation of the form . in a suitable scaling limit , a partial differential equation of fokker - planck type is derived for the distribution of opinion .",
    "similar diffusion equations are also obtained in @xcite as a mean field limit the sznajd model @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the model in @xcite is related to works in the kinetic theory of granular gases @xcite . in particular",
    ", the non - local nature of the compromise process is analogous to the variable coefficient of restitution in inelastic collisions @xcite .",
    "similar models are used in the modelling of wealth and income distributions which show pareto tails , cf .",
    "@xcite and the references therein .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we introduce two new , inhomogeneous models for opinion formation . in section",
    "[ sec : leadership ] we consider opinion formation dynamics which take into account the effect of opinion leadership .",
    "each individual is not only characterised by its opinion but also by another independent variable , the assertiveness , which quantifies its leadership potential .",
    "starting from a microscopic model for the opinion dynamics we arrive at an inhomogeneous boltzmann - type equation for the opinion distribution function .",
    "we show that , alternatively similar dynamics can be modelled by a multi - dimensional kinetic opinion formation model . in section  [ sec : bigsort ] we turn to the modelling of ` the big sort ' , the phenomenon that us citizens increasingly prefer to live among others who share their political opinions .",
    "we propose a kinetic model of opinion formation which takes into account these preferences .",
    "again , the time evolution of the opinion distribution is described by an inhomogeneous boltzmann - type equation . in section  [ sec : fokkerplanck ] we derive the corresponding macroscopic fokker - planck - type limit equations for the inhomogeneous boltzmann - type equations in a quasi - invariant opinion limit .",
    "details on the numerical solvers as well as results of numerical experiments are presented in section  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] concludes .",
    "the prevalent literature on opinion formation has focused on election processes , referendums or public opinion tendencies . with the exception of @xcite",
    "less attention has been paid to the important effect that opinion leaders have on the dissemination of new ideas and the diffusion of beliefs in a society .",
    "opinion leadership is one of several sociological models trying to explain formation of opinions in a society .",
    "certain , typical personal characteristics are supposed to characterise opinion leaders : high confidence , high self - esteem , a strong need to be unique , and the ability to withstand criticism .",
    "an opinion leader is socially active , highly connected and held in high esteem by those accepting his or her opinion .",
    "opinion leaders appears in such different areas as political parties and movements , advertisement of commercial products and dissemination of new technologies .    in the opinion formation model in @xcite",
    "the society is built of two groups , one group of opinion leaders , and one of ordinary people , so - called followers . in this model , individuals from the same group can influence each others opinions , but opinion leaders are assertive and , although able to influence followers , are unmoved by the followers opinions . in this model",
    "a leader always remains a leader , a follower always a follower .",
    "hence it is not possible to describe the emergence or deline of leaders .    in the model proposed in this section",
    "we assume that the leadership qualities ( like assertiveness , self - confidence , ... ) of each individual are characterised through an additional independent variable , to which we refer short as _",
    "assertiveness_. in the sociological literature the term assertiveness describes a person s tendency to actively defend , pursue and speak out for his or her own values preferences and goals . there has been a lot of research on how assertiveness is connected to leadership , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "our approach is based on toscani s model for opinion formation , but assumes that the compromise process is also influence by the assertiveness of the interacting individuals .",
    "the assertiveness of an individual is represented by the continuous variable @xmath25 with @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "the endpoints of the interval @xmath27 , i.e.  @xmath13 , represent a strongly or weakly assertive individual .",
    "a leader would correspond to a strongly assertive individual .",
    "the interaction for two individuals with opinion and assertiveness @xmath28 and @xmath29 reads as : @xmath30 the first term on the right hand sides of models the compromise process , the second the self - thinking process . the functions @xmath31 and @xmath24 model the local relevance of compromise and self - thinking for a given opinion , respectively . the constant _ compromise parameter _ @xmath32 controls the ` speed ' of attraction of two different opinions .",
    "the quantities @xmath33 @xmath21 are random variables with distribution @xmath34 with variance @xmath22 and zero mean , assuming values on a set @xmath35    let us discuss the interaction described in and its ingredients in more detail . in each such interaction ,",
    "the pre - interaction opinion @xmath15 increases ( gets closer to @xmath6 ) when @xmath36 and decreases in the opposite situation ; the change of the pre - interaction opinion @xmath6 happens in a similar way .",
    "we assume that the compromise process function @xmath37 can be written in the following form : @xmath38 in we will only allow interactions that guarantee @xmath39 . to this end , we assume @xmath40 let us now discuss useful assumptions on the functions @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "as in @xcite we assume that the ability to find a compromise is linked to the distance between opinions .",
    "the higher this distance is , the lower the possibility to find a compromise .",
    "hence , the _ localisation function _",
    "@xmath23 is assumed to be a decreasing function of its argument .",
    "usual choices are @xmath44 for some constant @xmath45 and smoothed variants thereof @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we assume the higher the assertiveness level , the lower the tendency of an individual to change their opinion .",
    "hence , @xmath46 should be decreasing in its argument , too . a possible choice for @xmath46 may be @xmath47 for some constant @xmath48 .",
    "this choice is motivated by the following considerations : let @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote two individuals with assertiveness and opinion @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "then the particular choice of corresponds to the two cases :    * if @xmath53 and @xmath54 , i.e.  a highly assertive individual @xmath49 meets a weakly assertive individual @xmath50 : then @xmath55 ( no influence of individual @xmath50 on @xmath49 ) , but @xmath56 ,",
    "i.e.  the leader @xmath49 persuades a weakly assertive individual @xmath50 . *",
    "if both individuals have a similar assertiveness level and hence  @xmath57 is small , there will be some exchange of opinion , no matter how large ( or small ) this assertiveness level is .",
    "( -1,0 )  ( 1.2,0 ) node[below ] @xmath58 ; ( -1,0 )  ( -1,1.2 ) node[right ] @xmath59 ; /in -1/-1,0/0,1/1 ( 0pt,2pt )  ( 0pt,-2pt ) node[below ] @xmath60 ; /in 0/0,1/1 ( 2pt,0pt )  ( -2pt,0pt ) node[left ] @xmath61 ; plot[id = r ] function0.5 - 0.5*tanh(5*x ) ; at ( 1.2,0.2 ) @xmath62 ; plot[id = h ] function(x<0 ) ? 1 : 0 ; at ( 0.8,0.9 ) @xmath63 ;    note that in the limit @xmath64 the choice corresponds to an approximation of @xmath65 with @xmath66 denoting the heaviside function , see figure  [ fig : choicer ] . in this limit , individuals are either maximally assertive in the interaction with a value of the assertiveness variable in @xmath67 , or minimally assertive with assertiveness in @xmath68 .",
    "effectively , one would recover in the same limit a variant of the opinion leader - follower model in @xcite if the assertiveness of individuals were assumed to be constant in time .",
    "we conclude by discussing the choice of @xmath69 we assume that the ability to change individual opinions by self - thinking decreases as one gets closer to the extremal opinions .",
    "this reflects the fact that extremal opinions are more difficult to change .",
    "therefore , we assume that the self - thinking function @xmath24 is a decreasing function of @xmath70 with @xmath71 we also need to choose the set @xmath72 i.e.  we have to specify the range of values the random variables @xmath20 , @xmath21 in can assume .",
    "clearly , it depends on the particular choice for @xmath69 let us consider the upper bound at @xmath73 first . to ensure that individuals opinions do not leave @xmath14 , we need @xmath74 obviously , the worst case is @xmath73 , where we have to ensure @xmath75 hence , if @xmath76 it suffices to have @xmath77 .",
    "a similar computation for the lower boundary shows that if @xmath78 it suffices to have @xmath79 .    in this setting , we are led to study the evolution of the distribution function as a function depending on the assertiveness @xmath80 , opinion @xmath11 and time @xmath81 , @xmath8 . in analogy with the classical kinetic theory of rarefied gases",
    ", we emphasise the role of the different independent variables by identifying the velocity with opinion , and the position with assertiveness . in this way , we assume at once that the variation of the distribution @xmath82 with respect to the opinion variable @xmath6 depends on ` collisions ' between agents , while the time change of distributions with respect to the assertiveness @xmath83 depends on the transport term . unlike in physical applications where the transport term involves the velocity field of particles , here the transport term contains an equivalent ` opinion - velocity field ' @xmath10 which controls the flux depending on the independent variables @xmath83 and @xmath6 .",
    "this is in contrast to the physical situation of rarefied gases where the field would simply be given by @xmath84 .    the time - evolution of the distribution function @xmath85 of individuals depending on assertiveness @xmath25 , opinion @xmath86 and time @xmath87 will obey an _",
    "inhomogeneous boltzmann - type equation _",
    ", @xmath88 herein , @xmath89 is the ` opinion - velocity field ' and @xmath90 is a suitable relaxation time which allows to control the interaction frequency . the boltzmann - like collision operator @xmath91 which describes the change of density due to binary interactions is derived by standard methods of kinetic theory",
    ". a useful way of writing the collision operators is the so - called weak form .",
    "it corresponds to consider , for all smooth functions @xmath92 , @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the operation of mean with respect to the random quantities @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "choosing @xmath95 as test function in and denoting the mass by @xmath96 implies conservation of mass , @xmath97 if there is point - wise conservation of opinion in each interaction in ( e.g.  choosing @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) , @xmath100 or , more generally , conservation of opinion in the mean in each interaction in ( e.g.  choosing @xmath98 ) , @xmath101 then the first moment , the mean opinion , is also conserved .",
    "this can be seen by choosing @xmath102 in . denoting the mean opinion by @xmath103 we obtain @xmath104    we still have to specify the ` opinion - velocity field ' @xmath105 .",
    "a possible choice can be @xmath106 where @xmath107 models the in- or decrease of the assertiveness level , while the prefactor @xmath108 ensures that the assertiveness level stays inside the domain @xmath27 .",
    "this leads to an _ inhomogeneous boltzmann - type equation _ of the following form @xmath109      alternatively , we can consider that both , change of opinion and and change of the assertiveness level happen through binary collisions . in this case",
    "we have the following interaction rules :    [ e : leadership2 ] @xmath110    herein , the functions @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 play the same role as in the previous section , and are assumed to fulfil the assumptions introduced earlier .",
    "the constant parameters @xmath32 and @xmath111 control the ` speed ' of attraction of opinions and repulsion of assertiveness , respectively . in addition",
    ", we introduce the function @xmath112 which describes the in- and decrease of the individual assertiveness level .",
    "it is assumed to fulfil @xmath113 together , these assumptions guarantee that @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the quantities @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath116 , @xmath117 are uncorrelated random variables with distribution @xmath34 with variances @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively , and zero mean , assuming values on a set @xmath35    to specify @xmath112 , we make the assumption that highly assertive individuals gain more assertiveness and weakly assertive ones loose assertiveness in a collision . therefore , we propose the following form : @xmath120 where the quadratic polynomial ensures that the assertiveness level remains in @xmath27 .    in this setting , we are led to study the evolution of the distribution function as a function depending on the assertiveness @xmath80 , opinion @xmath11 and time @xmath81 , @xmath8 .",
    "different to the previous section , we assume that the variation of the distribution @xmath82 with respect to both variables , assertiveness @xmath83 and opinion @xmath6 , depends on collisions between individuals .",
    "the time - evolution of the distribution function @xmath85 of individuals depending on assertiveness @xmath25 , opinion @xmath86 and time @xmath87 will obey a _",

    "in this section we are interested in modelling the clustering of individuals who share similar political opinions , a process that has been observed in the usa over the last decades .    in 2008 ,",
    "journalist bill bishop achieved popularity as the author of the book _ the big sort : why the clustering of like - minded america is tearing us apart _ @xcite .",
    "bishop s thesis is that us citizens increasingly choose to live among politically like - minded neighbours .",
    "based on county - level election results of us presidential elections in the past thirty years , he observed a doubling of so - called ` landslide counties ' , counties in which either candidate won or lost by 20 percentage points or more .",
    "such a segregation of political supporters may result in making political debates more bitter and hamper the political decision - making by consensus .",
    "bishop s findings were discussed and acclaimed in many newspapers and magazines , and former president bill clinton urged audiences to read the book . on the other hand",
    "his claims also met opposition from political sociologists @xcite who argued that political segregation is only a by - product of the correlation of political opinions with other sociologic ( cultural background , race , ... ) and economic factors which drive citizens residential preferences .",
    "one could consider to include such additional factors in a generalised kinetic model , and potentially even couple the opinion dynamics with a kinetic model for wealth distribution @xcite .",
    "` the big sort ' lends itself as an ideal subject to study inhomogeneous kinetic models for opinion formation . in this context",
    "we are faced with spatial inhomogeneity rather than inhomogeneity in assertiveness as in section  [ sec : leadership ] . in the following",
    "we propose a kinetic model for opinion formation when the individuals are driven towards others with a similar political opinion .",
    "we study the evolution of the distribution function of political opinion as a function depending on three independent variables , the continuous political opinion variable @xmath124 $ ] , the position @xmath125 on our ( virtual ) map and time @xmath81 , @xmath8 . in analogy with the classical kinetic theory of rarefied gases ,",
    "we assume that the variation of the distribution @xmath82 with respect to the political opinion variable @xmath6 depends on collisions between individuals , while the time change of distributions with respect to the position @xmath83 depends on the transport term , which contains the ` opinion - velocity field ' @xmath126 .",
    "the specific choice of @xmath89 is discussed further below .",
    "the exchange of opinion is modelled by binary collisions in the operator @xmath127 and has a similar structure as .",
    "let @xmath128 and @xmath129 denote the positions of two individuals with opinion @xmath15 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "then the interaction rule reads as :    [ e : bigsort ] @xmath130    in we make the following assumptions :    * individuals exchange opinion if they are close to each other , i.e. their physical distance is less than a certain radius .",
    "this is modelled by the function @xmath131 with some radius @xmath132 . * the functions @xmath41 and @xmath43 and the random quantities @xmath20 ,",
    "@xmath21 satisfy the same assumptions as in section  [ sec : leadership ] .",
    "we still need to specify the ` opinion - velocity field ' @xmath105 . as as first approach it helps to think of @xmath105 modelling the movement of individuals with respect to a given initial configuration : we consider @xmath133 and a number of counties @xmath134 which constitute a disjoint cover of @xmath133 , each with a county seat @xmath135 $ ] with position in @xmath133 and an election result ( by plurality voting system ) which is either ` red / republican ' ( @xmath136 ) or ` blue / democratic ' ( @xmath137 ) . in our numerical experiments",

    "this assumption is confirmed by our numerical experiments , see figure [ f : ex2 ] .",
    "we observe the formation of peaks close to the maximum and minimum assertiveness level ; the number of peaks again depends on the interaction radius @xmath285 .     +    .",
    "our last example illustrates the rich behaviour of the proposed models .",
