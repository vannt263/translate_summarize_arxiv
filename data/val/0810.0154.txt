    "in recent years , advances in information and communication technologies have been demanding high data - rate wireless communications . in order to realize high data - rate wireless communications , bandwidth of systems should be as wide as possible , which means that such systems should have a large degree of freedom .",
    "those systems are also required to be able to operate efficiently even in bad and uncertain environments .",
    "for example , in urban areas , there are many obstacles , such as buildings , cars , and people , which interact with wireless communication systems as reflecting / scattering bodies , thereby making communication environment very complex . in analyzing wireless communication systems ,",
    "therefore , one has to regard them as systems with very high dimensionality and randomness .",
    "this is why statistical mechanics approach is expected to be useful in studying wireless communication systems .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a problem arising from considerations of multiple - access channels . typically , a wireless communication system has to accommodate multiple users simultaneously .",
    "in such a system , signals coming from different users interfere with each other .",
    "how to mitigate such multiple - access interference ( mai ) is one of the most important problems in wireless communications .",
    "code - division multiple - access ( cdma )  @xcite provides an effective scheme to mitigate mai , and is widely used in various commercial systems . in cdma ,",
    "an information symbol of a user is modulated with a spreading sequence assigned to the user .",
    "receiver has to estimate information symbols based on received sequences by utilizing knowledge of spreading sequences of the users .",
    "a conventional choice to mitigate mai is to use pseudorandom sequences as the spreading sequences .",
    "although analysis of such randomly - spread cdma systems was thought to be difficult , it has turned out that _ replica method _ , which is an analytical tool developed in the research field of statistical physics of disordered systems ( spin glasses ) , is very useful for the analysis  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , these studies have revealed that replica method allows us to evaluate `` macroscopic '' performance of cdma systems with independent and identically - distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random spreading sequences in the large - system limit , such as mutual information between inputs and outputs , bit error rate , and so on .    since theoretical performance of cdma systems is affected by choices of spreading sequences , design of spreading sequences is an important problem in cdma .",
    "there have been several researches in which the problem of designing spreading sequences is formulated in terms of an optimization problem . for example , rupf and massey  @xcite discussed optimization of spreading sequences with the channel capacity of cdma systems as a measure of optimization .",
    "they showed that so - called welch bound equality ( wbe ) spreading sequences , which minimize the total squared correlation ( tsc ) of spreading sequences , achieve the channel capacity .",
    "we restrict ourselves to considering the optimization problem of spreading sequences of cdma systems with the mutual information between inputs and outputs as the measure of optimization .",
    "there have been several researches in which such optimization problems are discussed  @xcite .",
    "they have assumed inputs of the system to be gaussian distributed and discussed theoretical upper bound ( i.e. , channel capacity ) of mutual information between inputs and outputs . if one wishes to consider realistic wireless communication systems , however , it is important to study the optimization problem under the assumption of non - gaussian inputs .",
    "the objective of this paper is therefore to discuss the optimization problem of spreading sequences of cdma systems when one allows non - gaussian inputs .",
    "we would like to emphasize that , unlike previous statistical - mechanics studies of cdma systems  @xcite whose objectives are basically to analyze macroscopic system performance , we show in this paper that the statistical - mechanics approach is also useful in dealing with design problems in wireless communication , with the optimization problem of spreading sequences of cdma systems as a demonstrative example .",
    "a digest version of this paper has been presented as a conference paper  @xcite .",
    "we consider the following real - valued @xmath0-user cdma channel model , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an information symbol of user @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that @xmath4 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables , and let @xmath5 be the prior probability of @xmath2 , whose mean and variance are assumed to be zero and one , respectively .",
    "@xmath6 is the spreading sequence of user @xmath3 in the symbol interval of interest , and @xmath7 denotes the spreading factor of the cdma channel model .",
    "we assume that the power of the spreading sequences is normalized to one , so that @xmath8 holds for @xmath9 .",
    "we assume additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) : @xmath10 so that @xmath11 is the variance of awgn .",
    "let us introduce the following notations : @xmath12^t$ ] , @xmath13^t$ ] , @xmath14^t$ ] , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the system model   is then rewritten as @xmath17    one can consider a maximization problem of per user mutual information between @xmath18 and @xmath19 with respect to the spreading sequences @xmath20 , with the channel input @xmath18 drawn from the probability distribution @xmath21 , @xmath22 where the notation @xmath23 denotes the mutual information between @xmath18 and @xmath19 when @xmath20 is specified .",
    "when @xmath24 , the mutual information @xmath25 is maximized by assigning to all users orthogonal @xmath7-dimensional vectors as spreading sequences , regardless of the input distribution @xmath5 . when @xmath26 , on the other hand , spreading sequences maximizing the mutual information @xmath25 are not trivial",
    ". when @xmath2 , @xmath27 , are i.i.d .",
    "standard gaussian random variables , it is known that the wbe spreading sequences maximize the mutual information @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "wbe spreading sequences are characterized as  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an @xmath7-dimensional identity matrix .",
    "when one assumes gaussian inputs , spreading sequences maximizing @xmath25 have been identified in more general system models than  .",
    "for example , in a system model where one allows the power of inputs to be different , viswanath and anantharam  @xcite showed that the mutual information is maximized by assigning orthogonal spreading sequences to relatively high - power users and so - called generalized wbe spreading sequences to the remaining users , where the users are classified according to a certain criterion . also , in a system model where the inputs may arrive asynchronously , luo _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the mutual information is maximized by spreading sequences which can be regarded as an extension of the ones which viswanath and anantharam proposed .    on the other hand , when @xmath2 s are drawn from a non - gaussian distribution , to the authors knowledge ,",
    "spreading sequences maximizing the mutual information   have not been known .",
    "we analyze , via statistical mechanics , spreading sequences maximizing the mutual information of the system with non - gaussian inputs . since the case with non - gaussian inputs is difficult to analyze analytically , we resort to making several assumptions .",
    "first , we evaluate mutual information in the large - system limit , in which the number of users @xmath0 and the spreading factor @xmath7 are both sent to infinity while maintaining their ratio @xmath30 constant .",
    "second , we assume random spreading . more specifically , we assume that the sample correlation matrix @xmath31 of random spreading sequences @xmath20 is asymptotically orthogonally invariant , that is , the probability law of @xmath32 and that of an orthogonal transform @xmath33 are the same for any orthogonal matrix @xmath34 in the large - system limit , and that empirical eigenvalue distribution of @xmath32 converges to a limiting eigenvalue distribution @xmath35 with a finite support included in @xmath36 $ ] , in the large - system limit . under the assumption of random spreading , we consider the average conditional mutual information in the large - system limit , @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes expectation with respect to @xmath20 , and where @xmath39 is conditional mutual information between @xmath18 and @xmath19 given @xmath20 . we discuss maximization of @xmath40 with respect to characteristics of the random matrix @xmath20 .",
    "the average mutual information   is decomposed into two terms , @xmath41\\\\   & = \\mathcal{f } - \\frac{1}{2 \\beta } \\left ( 1 + \\log ( 2\\pi \\sigma^2)\\right ) , \\label{eq : capa2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes expectation with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "direct calculation of the right - hand side of   is in general computationally intractable . in order to evaluate  ,",
    "we invoke the replica method .",
    "substituting the identity @xmath44 to the right - hand side of  , we obtain @xmath45 we assume that the limit with respect to @xmath0 and the limit and the differentiation with respect to @xmath46 are interchangeable without altering the final result , obtaining @xmath47 the limit @xmath48 allows us to apply the saddle - point method to evaluate a relevant quantity .",
    "we apply replica trick in order to evaluate  , in which we first evaluate @xmath49 assuming that @xmath46 is a non - negative integer , and then perform the limit and the differentiation with respect to @xmath46 , assuming that @xmath46 is real .",
