    "the radiative pion capture ( rpc ) in pionic atoms has been extensively studied in the past  @xcite-@xcite . in this process ,",
    "the @xmath0 sited in a given @xmath1 orbit of a pionic atom is captured by the nucleus emitting a photon .",
    "the interest of this reaction is threefold .",
    "first , it provides direct information about the @xmath2-nucleus interaction , responsible for the formation of the pionic bound state .",
    "second , it proves the nuclear structure , specifically the details of the proton - distribution , and the nature of the two particle  two hole ( @xmath3 ) effects in the nuclear medium .",
    "finally , it gives valuable information on the @xmath4 reaction on the nucleon at very low pion kinetic energies and in this sense it is complementary to the pion photoproduction reactions . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the second aspect mentioned above .",
    "technically , the most difficult aspect in the theoretical side is the evaluation of the sum over final nuclear states .",
    "this has made necessary the use of different approaches such us the closure approximation  @xcite or the rpa sum rules  @xcite . in the first case ,",
    "the results show a considerable dependence on the average photon energy used , a problem which is minimized by the rpa sum rules method .",
    "however , this two approximations only give integrated quantities ( e.g. the radiative capture widths and branching ratios ) , but observables such as the photon energy distribution are out of their possibilities .",
    "more recently , chiang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have proposed a many  body approach in which both the photon energy distribution and the radiative capture width can be calculated .",
    "starting from techniques developed for the @xmath5 reaction  @xcite , this method permits the use of accurate pionic wave functions and the incorporation of the medium polarization effects . besides",
    ", the calculations are considerably simplified because they are done in infinite nuclear matter and applied to finite nuclei by means of the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "though the obtained branching ratios and widths are in overall agreement with the experimental results , the photon energy distribution does not show the marked tail of the data at low photon energies .",
    "this last problem is partially due to the limited momentum components available to the nuclear wave functions obtained from the fermi gas ( fg ) model .",
    "shell  model ( sm ) calculations do not present this deficiency .",
    "this was observed in the pioneering work of vergados  @xcite and eramzhyam _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and in the results obtained by ohtsuka and ohtsubo  @xcite and wnsch  @xcite within the continuum sm approach .",
    "much of this work has been devoted to the analysis of the role played by the resonances in the reaction and the main conclusion is that the rpc can be described assuming a dominant resonance character for the process .    in this work",
    "we want to investigate the dynamics of the rpc reaction in more detail by analyzing it with a continuum sm recently developed to study the quasi  free inclusive electron scattering by nuclei  @xcite .",
    "in particular we want to address different questions related to the importance of the parameters of the sm potential , to the problem of the orthogonality of the single  particle wave functions and to the effect of the inclusion of the particle  hole ( @xmath6 ) self  energy in the medium on the @xmath6 propagator .",
    "this latter effect accounts for the final state interactions ( fsi ) of the emitted neutron with the residual nucleus .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we give the details of the model used to perform the calculations with the explicit expressions of the necessary matrix elements placed in the appendix . in sect .",
    "3 we show the results and comment the main features . in sect .",
    "4 we summarize our work and draw our conclusions .",
    "in this work we study the following reaction :    @xmath7    where the pion is captured by the nucleus emitting a neutron and a photon , being the latter one the only particle detected .",
    "the unpolarized differential photon distribution for the capture of a pion , bound in the orbit @xmath1 , from a spin zero nucleus is given by  @xcite :    @xmath8 .\\ ] ]    here it has been taken into account the fact that the nuclear states as well as that of the pion have good angular momenta , what makes useful to perform a multipole expansion of the operators involved . in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , @xmath9 is the fine structure constant , @xmath10 is the energy of the emitted photon , @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the initial ( taking into account the pion degrees of freedom ) and final hadronic states of the system and @xmath13 are their respective energies . besides , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the electric and magnetic multipole operators which are given by : @xmath16 \\right\\ }   \\cdot { \\bf j}({\\bf r } ) , \\\\ \\label{magnetic } t_{jm}^{\\rm mag}(q)&= &    \\int { \\rm d}^3 r \\ ,    j_j ( qr)\\,{\\bf y}_{jj}^m ( \\hat{\\bf r})\\cdot { \\bf j } ( { \\bf r}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is a spherical bessel function and * y*@xmath18 a vector spherical harmonic .",
    "finally , * j*(*r * ) is the electromagnetic current operator .    the amplitude for the elementary process @xmath4 , which determines the hadronic current , depends  @xcite on the spin of the nucleon involved in the process , the photon polarization and the pion and photon momenta .",
    "however , the average momentum of the bound pion in light and medium nuclei is small and in this situation it is plausible to take into account only the so  called kroll  ruderman term ( which is the one surviving in the limit of zero pion momentum ) .",
    "then we have for the electromagnetic current operator @xmath19 here , the index @xmath20 runs over the @xmath21 nucleons of the system with coordinates @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the pion ",
    "nucleon coupling constant ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 is the pion mass , @xmath26 is the nucleon mass and @xmath27 are spin pauli matrices . besides , the isospin operator @xmath28 transforms a proton into a neutron .",
    "finally , @xmath29 is the pion field operator which can be developed in a complete basis as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath31 runs over all the pionic atom orbits , @xmath32 is the corresponding pion wave function , @xmath33 is the pion annihilation operator , and @xmath34 is the pion energy including its mass .    after substituting the current  ( [ current ] ) in eqs .",
    "( [ electric ] ) and ( [ magnetic ] ) it is possible to obtain the tensor form of these electromagnetic operators and calculate the matrix elements involved in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "these expressions can be found in the appendix .",
    "the matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) require the definition of the initial and final states of the system .",
    "we are dealing with closed ",
    "shell nuclei and then our initial state is built by coupling the @xmath0 atomic wave function with the closed ",
    "shell core .",
    "thus the initial state is given by : @xmath35^{j_i}_{m_i}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 and @xmath37 the slater determinant corresponding to the closed ",
    "shell nucleus .",
    "the slater determinant is built with single ",
    "particle wave functions obtained by diagonalizing a woods  saxon potential well @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the coulomb potential created by an homogeneous charge distribution of radius @xmath41 . the parameters of this potential are adjusted to reproduce different nuclear properties such as , e.g. , the experimental single ",
    "particle energies around the fermi level , the r.m.s . radius or the charge density  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the pion state , @xmath42 , is defined as follows : @xmath43 with",
    "@xmath44 the pion vacuum state , @xmath45 and @xmath46 the principal , orbital angular momentum and magnetic quantum numbers of the pion atomic orbit and @xmath47 spherical harmonic functions .",
    "the radial pion wave function @xmath48 and the pion energy @xmath49 are obtained by solving the klein - gordon equation with a pion - nucleus optical potential .",
    "this potential has been developed microscopically and it is exposed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite for pionic atoms .",
    "it contains the coulombian @xmath0- nucleus interaction and the ordinary lowest order optical potential constructed from the @xmath50 and @xmath51wave @xmath52 amplitudes . in addition second order terms in both @xmath50 and @xmath51waves , responsible for pion absorption , are also considered .",
    "standard corrections to both the electromagnetic ( finite size of the nucleus and vacuum polarization ) and strong ( second - order pauli re - scattering term , att term , lorentz ",
    "lorenz effect , long and short range nuclear correlations ) parts of the potential are also taken into account .",
    "this theoretical potential reproduces fairly well the data of pionic atoms ( binding energies and strong absorption widths )  @xcite and low energy @xmath2-nucleus scattering  @xcite .    in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , the initial energy @xmath53 corresponds to the energy of the @xmath54 system , including the pion binding energy .",
    "as we are only interested in the excitation nuclear energy , we take the energy of the initial closed ",
    "shell nucleus as our zero of energies .",
    "thus the initial energy @xmath53 can be identified as the pion mass plus its binding energy , @xmath49 .",
    "the final states are described in terms of a neutron particle in the continuum and a proton hole coupled to the final angular momentum @xmath55 , @xmath56^{j_f}_{m_f } \\ , |0^+\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is the particle ( hole ) creation operator .",
    "the particle states are obtained by solving the schrdinger equation for positive energies .",
    "we have used the same woods ",
    "saxon potential as for the discrete single  particle levels in order to ensure the orthogonality of the states involved in the process ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "it is important to mention here that , in view of the definition of the final states we are using , the sum over final states @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) should be changed to : @xmath60    therefore , to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) we must perform a sum over the quantum numbers of the final particle - hole states ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 and the total angular momentum @xmath55 of the @xmath6 excitation ) and the photon angular momentum ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the sum over @xmath64 is indeed an integration which is performed by means of the delta of energies which appears in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) . actually , in our model , the final energy @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 with @xmath67 the energy of the single ",
    "level @xmath9 and @xmath68 the difference between the masses of the particle ( neutron ) and hole ( proton ) nucleons .",
    "thus , for each value of the photon energy @xmath10 and each hole @xmath69 , @xmath64 is univocally determined by the delta function in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "note also that the sum over the photon multipoles , @xmath63 , ranges from one to infinity .",
    "the larger is the photon energy or the nuclear mass , the bigger is the number of photon multipoles needed to obtain convergence . in the rpc process",
    ", the maximum photon energy is around the pion mass and we have found in @xmath70ca a good convergence with four or five multipoles .    one final detail concerns to the hole - energies used in our calculation .",
    "as it was mentioned above , our mean - field potential has been adjusted to reproduce single - particle energies around the fermi level . to improve the energetic balance in our model , in the actual calculation the experimental proton single - particle energies values , when known , have been used . in table",
    "[ tab : single - energies ] , we compare these values to the computed mean - field proton hole energies .    .proton hole single - particle energies ( mev ) .",
    "we show the theoretical energies computed with the sm potential described in sect .",
    "[ sec : nucl ] ( third column ) and the experimental ones ( fourth column ) . for more details , see ref .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]    4 .",
    "we have not included rpa correlations in our model . in ref .",
    "@xcite rpa lead to a reduction of about 40% in the integrated ratios without changing the shape of the photon distribution . in table",
    "[ tab : pot-2 ] we compare the sm results , without including @xmath3 correlations ( in brackets ) , to those obtained with the lda fg model of ref .  @xcite without including rpa correlations ( last row ) .",
    "we see that the fg model value ( 2.74 ) is significantly higher than the sm ones , part of this discrepancy being due to the use of different proton and neutron center distributions in both types of calculations . to make more reliable the comparison",
    ", we also show the lda fg results obtained using the proton and neutron densities derived from the different wood - saxon potentials used in the sm calculations .",
    "we can see now that the fg model gives similar results to those of the sm and it is also subject to the same type of uncertainties ( 20 - 25% ) associated to the precise details of the nuclear dynamics .",
    "similar results are obtained in carbon and oxygen . + however",
    ", we would like to point out that the lda fg results are in most cases above the sm ones .",
    "this can be due to the undoubted deficiencies of the fg picture of the nucleus to describe processes where low nuclear excitation energies are involved .",
    "but one could also try to explain this disagreement ( or part of it ) by questioning the validity of the lda to describe a surface process like the one studied here . in any case , because of the zero range character of the kroll ",
    "ruderman interaction considered here , lda should work much better than what one could expect .",
    "+ in any case , and in view of the results in table  [ tab : pot-2 ] , one might think that the effect of the inclusion of the rpa correlations could be similar in both models .",
    "the fact that the sm result shows an uncertainty comparable to the expected rpa effects prevents us to try to include such correlations before having a more reliable nuclear model .",
    "in this paper we have reanalyzed the rpc process in light and medium nuclei .",
    "we have presented a simple continuum sm which describes successfully the shape of the photon distribution .",
    "we have paid a special attention to the study of the low energy part of the photon spectrum which could not be fully understood within the different models found in the literature and in special in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , despite of being the only one able to describe the experimental integrated ratios @xmath71 thorough the periodic table .",
    "we have found that the effect of @xmath3 correlations play an essential role to describe the tail at low energies of the photon distribution and that these effects together with the use of nucleon wave functions with non - vanishing high momentum components allow us for a correct description of this part of the spectrum .",
    "we have also found that the region of high photon energies depends strongly on the details of the nuclear model used . in that region when the outgoing neutron is bound , the photon spectrum exhibits peaks characteristic of the energy spectrum of the final nucleus .",
    "also in this region , when the emitted neutron goes to the continuum , there are peaks corresponding to resonances of the final residual nucleus .",
    "much effort have been invested in the past to extract information about these nuclear bound and resonances states  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we think that a first necessary step to attack this interesting problem is a correct understanding of the quasifree background , studied here , which requires the inclusion of two body mechanisms and to deal with orthogonal particle - hole states .",
    "thus , results presented in this paper could be used in future to isolated the contribution of such nuclear states from the experimental data .",
    "this would clearly represent an improvement with respect previous works where the subtraction of the quasifree background was performed by means of optical model calculations or the non - theoretical founded pole model ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    finally , we have obtained values for the integrated ratio @xmath71 in good agreement with those found with the fg model of ref.@xcite .",
    "we have also discussed different mechanisms which could account for the remaining discrepancies with the experimental data .",
    "none of them are expected to make narrower the photon distribution because , as we have mentioned above , the tail of the distribution is mainly due to @xmath3 effects and high momentum components in the nucleon wave functions and these physical effects will be present in all new contributions to the rpc rate .",
    "we are indebted to p. trol for providing us with the files containing part of the experimental data presented in this work .",
    "this research was supported by dges under contract pb95 - 1204 and by the junta de andaluca .",
