    "iras surveys have revealed that a significant fraction of extragalactic objects produce the bulk of their radiation at far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths ( soifer 1986 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 for a recent review ) .",
    "imaging surveys of luminous infrared galaxies ( ligs ; @xmath1 ) showed that the vast majority of these objects is morphologically disturbed , with spatial structures indicative of galactic mergers ( e.g. sanders et al .",
    "1988 ; clements et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the interest on the nature of ligs grew during the last few years as they may represent an important step in the global process of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "indeed , strong evolution in the space density of ligs has been detected in the deep mid - infrared ( mir ; taniguchi et al . 1997 ; aussel et al .",
    "1999 ) and fir surveys ( kawara et al . 1998 ; puget et al . 1999 ) with iso satellite",
    ". reports from the first deep sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) surveys with scuba ( smail et al . 1997 ; hughes et al . 1998 ; barger et al . 1998 ;",
    "eales et al .",
    "1999 ) showed that the space density of ligs at high redshift ( @xmath2 ) appears sufficient to account for nearly all of the fir / sub - mm background radiation ( e.g. barger , cowie & sanders 1999 ) .",
    "it seems clear that detailed studies of nearby ligs are a required first step in order to better understand their high - redshift counterparts , and in particular to reveal the nature of the dominant energy source responsible for their enormous fir luminosity ( lutz & tacconi 1999 ) .",
    "results from recent studies at mir ( e.g. genzel et al . 1998 ) and radio wavelengths suggest that the majority of ligs are powered predominantly by young and hot stars rather than by active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "however , there is growing evidence from optical / near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopy that the frequency of agn occurrence among ligs increases with increasing fir luminosity ( e.g. veilleux et al .",
    "1995 ; kim , veilleux & sanders 1998 ; veilleux , sanders & kim 1999 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we refer to the sample of seven ligs recently observed in the mir ( from 8 to 18 ) by soifer et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter s01 ) using the keck telescopes with spatial resolution approaching the diffraction limit .",
    "these seven objects are among the closest ligs and have been classified as starburst galaxies from optical spectroscopy ( armus et al .",
    "1989 ; veilleux et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "s01 give some important results by the analysis of the mir data ( s01 , table 3 ) about , sizes , temperatures , and luminosities in the different sources .",
    "we would like , however , to explain the results by modelling the emitting clouds or clumps in dusty regions surrounding the starbursts .",
    "dust plays a major role in ir emission .",
    "we will thus investigate the distribution of dust in the different starburst regions within the galaxies , and dust - to - gas properties on small local scales .",
    "for sake of consistency , we will focus on both the continuum radiations and the optical emission lines from each galaxy of the sample .",
    "when the spectra are integrated , we will try to distinguish the contributions of clouds with different physical conditions , photoionized by starbursts of different ages .",
    "the models adopted up to now for the calculation of dust emission in the ir ( e.g. siebenmorgen et al 1999 ) accounted for heating of dust by star radiation in starbursts , and for power - law radiation in agn .",
    "the grains are destroyed by photo - dissociation . however , in the turbulent regime created by the starburst , shocks are playing a major role by heating gas and dust and by leading to sputtering of the grains .",
    "we will focus on the clouds in the very starburst regions .",
    "therefore , in our models we account for the coupled effect of radiation from an external source and for the shocks .",
    "gas and dust mutually heat each other by collisions in shock turbulent regimes . regarding the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the continuum , recall that the frequency corresponding to the dust reradiation peak depends on the shock velocity ( e.g. viegas & contini 1994 ) .",
    "at high shock velocities , the grains will reach high temperatures in the immediate post shock region , before being destroyed by sputtering , so that dust reradiation will peak in the mir , whereas , at low velocities , the peak appears in the fir .",
    "actually , our goal consists in modelling the continuum sed of each galaxy in the s01 sample , particularly in the ir range , adopting the data in the mir presented by s01 and completed with data from ned ( see appendix b for the list of references ) at other wavelengths .",
    "indeed , the data from the ned show different precisions and different apertures , leading to a large scattering .",
    "the s01 data , however , refer to the ir range and hardly include radiation from the gas , so ned data are included in our modelling in order to determine the gas - to - dust ratio .    in most of the objects of the sample different fractions of flux from the old star population background are included in the near - ir ( nir ) data , as generally found in agn and starburst galaxies ( viegas & contini 2000 ) .",
    "we will try to fit the data corresponding to the lowest flux by emission from the clouds in the objects ( e.g. ngc 1614 , ngc 2623 , ngc 3690 ) , and those corresponding to the highest flux by the black body emission .",
    "in fact , the data from the ned in the nir cluster within the black body curve .",
    "the models which explain the continuum sed are constrained by the agreement with observations of the emission - line spectra ( armus et al .",
    "1989 ; veilleux et al .",
    "the spectra are quite poor in number of emission lines , however , being the most significant ones ( [ oiii ] 5007 , [ oi ] 6300 , [ nii ] 6584 , and [ sii ] 6716 + 6731 ) they are enough to constrain the models .    to obtain a basis for modelling ,",
    "we have compared the observed emission - line ratios of each galaxy with the models presented in contini & viegas ( 2001a , hereafter cv01 ) , where model calculations of line spectra in the uv - optical - ir ranges are presented .",
    "the results are obtained by the suma code ( viegas & contini 1994 ) which , besides the line and continuum spectra emitted by the gas , also calculates reradiation by dust .",
    "dust features are summarized in sect .",
    "the models in cv01 are all calculated adopting a dust - to - gas ratio @xmath3 by mass . in many cases",
    "the @xmath4 value will be increased to fit the sed in the ir .",
    "the line ratios will then change accordingly , because a high @xmath4 in the postshock region , before complete destruction of the grains by sputtering , acts as an increased density , speeding up the cooling processes .",
    "this will lead to a refinement of the models in order to obtain the best fit to the observational data .",
    "the models are described in sect .",
    "3 . recall that modelling the line and continuum spectra simultaneously implies cross - checking them ( sect .",
    "4 ) until a fine tuning is obtained ( contini et al .",
    "the models adopted in this work are described and referred to the models of cv01 in appendix a ( table a1 ) .",
    "discussion of results and concluding remarks appear in sect .",
    "emission from a starburst is generally calculated by computing the radiative transfer in the galactic nuclei under the assumption of spherical symmetry ( siebenmorgen , krugel , & zota 1999 ) , or treating the starburst ( efastathiou et al . 2000 ) as an ensemble of optically thick giant molecular clouds centrally illuminated by recently formed stars . _",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio is not required for computing the radiation transfer models . _",
    "hildebrand ( 1983 ) discussed direct methods to determine cloud and dust masses and derived a lower limit ( @xmath0 60 ) for g / d ( where g = m@xmath5 and d = m@xmath6 ) calculating m@xmath5 from visual extinction and m@xmath6 by thermal emission .",
    "a rough g / d @xmath0 100 was estimated , given the errors for the implied coefficients ( dielectric , etc ) .    generally , three population of grains are adopted to fit the average is extinction curve .",
    "1 ) large grains of silicate and amorphous carbon , with a volume ratio of v@xmath7/v@xmath8 = 1.4 ( siebenmorgen et al .",
    "1999 ) and a power - law size distribution , a@xmath9 with q=3.5 ( 100@xmath10a@xmath102500 a ) provide the bulk of emission responsible for 9.7 and 18  resonance .",
    "2 ) small graphite particles corresponding to q=4 ( 10@xmath10a@xmath10100 a ) emit primarily at mir wavelengths .",
    "being small , they show dramatic fluctuations in temperature .",
    "3 ) pah carriers of ir features correspond to single molecules with 25 carbon atoms and clusters of 10 - 20 molecules .",
    "the small graphite and pah are underabundant with respect to ism by factors of 10 or more .",
    "cold dust or cirrus emission results from heating by the is radiation field , warm dust is associated with star formation regions , and hot dust appears around an active nucleus ( helou 1986 ) .",
    "rowan - robinson & crawford ( 1989 ) found that the ratio of the starburst emission to the cirrus emission is 2 to 1 .",
    "pahs are responsible for no more than 22 % of the total 3 - 1100  emission ( dale et al .",
    "2001 ) , the exact percentage depending on the activity level of the interstellar medium .",
    "diffuse ism radiates strongly in 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , 12.7  and in atomic emission lines ( spoon et al . 2002 ) , the relative strengths of the different pah emission bands being a strong function of the pah size : small pah radiates strongly at 6.2 and 7.7 , while larger pahs emit most of their powers at increasingly long wavelengths .",
    "moreover , laboratory simulations predict a double peaked bump in the 18 - 23  wave band , due to the morphological transformation of ice on grain mantles ( contini 1990 ) .",
    "a broad absorption band due to the si - o stretching mode in amorphous silicates , centered at 9.7  is also commonly detected in galaxies ( spoon et al 2002 ) .",
    "the center of the silicate absorption coincides with the gap between the 6.2 and 8.6  and 11.3 - 12.8  pah complexes .",
    "therefore , it is not clear whether the 9.7  flux minimum should be interpreted as the `` trough '' between pah emission features or as strong silicate absorption , or a combination of the two .",
    "a strong silicate feature is often accompanied by mir absorption features , due to molecules frozen in ice mantles which leads to a deep and broad 3.0  water ice feature .",
    "the interplay of 6.0  water ice and 5.25,5.7 , 6.25 pah emission is shown in many spectra ( spoon et al 2002 ) .",
    "turbulent and hostile environments in galaxies often destroy the molecular material that resides in or close to these regions .",
    "pahs are likely to be destroyed , or severely dumped in localized regions of high heating intensity such as the regions near ob associations ( dale et al .",
    "2001 ) , and may evaporate in a strong uv radiation field ( siebenmorgen et al .",
    "mid - ir flux may also be diminished toward regions of high extinction in agn - dominated galaxies , but it is unclear whether significant obscuration also occurs for starburst galaxies . moreover ,",
    "sputtering of grains throughout shock fronts is efficient for shock velocities in the range suitable to starburst galaxies and agn ( viegas & contini 1994 ) . in conclusion ,",
    "pah emission comes from the extended region of the galaxy .",
    "coronal lines eventually blended with the bands of pah and water ice ( contini & viegas 2001 ) are the following : [ mgviii ] 3.03 , [ siix ] 3.9 , [ mgvii ] 5.5 , [ mgv ] 5.6 , [ nevi ] 7.6 , [ fevii ] 7.8 , [ ariii ] 8.99 , [ fevii ] 9.52 , [ siv ] 10.54 , [ neii ] 12.8 , etc .",
    "( see also sturm et al 2002 ) we have included lines which do not exactly correspond to the bands , because large fwhm of line profiles , corresponding to high velocities , lead to blending with the closer bands . mg",
    "and si are easily locked up in dust grains . in this case their lines in the mir would not interfere with the bands .",
    "on the other hand , ne is not adsorbed in grains due to its atomic configuration , therefore , the ne lines coexist with dust features .    model results ( cv01 ) regarding black body radiation from stars show that [ neii ] are strong for shock velocities @xmath11 100 and u@xmath10 10 , while [ ariii ] may be detected for  between 200 and 500 and decreases at higher velocities , independently from the black body intensity flux .",
    "shock dominated models ( contini & viegas 2001b ) show that [ neii ] is strong for = 100 .",
    "high ionization lines appear for @xmath12 200 , particularly [ nevi ] , increasing at = 500 , [ nevi ] and [ neii ] being the strongest at = 300 .",
    "the high level lines [ mgviii ] , [ siix ] , [ mgvii ] are strong for = 1000 , particularly , [ siix ] 3.9 .",
    "the suma code is described in cv01 and in viegas & contini ( 1994 ) .",
    "the input parameters are the following : the shock velocity , , the preshock density , 0 , the preshock magnetic field , 0 , the starburst age , @xmath13 , the ionization parameter , @xmath14 ( in number of photons / number of electrons ) , the geometrical thickness of the clouds , d , and the dust - to - gas ratio , @xmath4 .",
    "relative abundances to h of he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , and fe are cosmic ( allen 1973 ) .    in our models",
    "we refer to clouds close to the starburst and therefore affected by radiation and shocks with velocities @xmath12 100 .",
    "dust is collisionally heated by the gas across the shock front and downstream .",
    "the temperature of dust follows the temperature of gas and can reach very high temperatures in the postshock region , for  @xmath15 100 ( figs . 1 , left diagram ) .    the models in fig .",
    "1 ( left ) are the following : = 1000 , 0=1000 3 ( solid lines ) ; = 500 , 0=300 3 ( long - dashed lines ) ; = 300 , 0=300 3 ( short - dashed lines ) ; and = 100 , 0=100 3 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "for all the models @xmath16 = 1 pc , 0 = 10@xmath17 gauss and @xmath18 are adopted .    the distribution on grain size is automatically derived by suma which calculates sputtering in the different zone downstream of the shock .",
    "the sputtering rate depends on the gas temperature , that is @xmath19 @xmath20 in the immediate postshock region . in fig .",
    "1 ( right diagram ) the distribution of grain radius downstream in two cases of relative strong ( = 500 ) and weak ( = 100 ) shocks is shown for silicate grains with an initial radius a@xmath21= 0.2 and 0.06 . in the high velocity case",
    "the sputtering rate is so high that grains with a@xmath21= 0.06  are rapidly destroyed downstream .",
    "so , only grains with large radius ( a@xmath21 @xmath12 0.1 )  will survive downstream , while small grains are completely sputtered . on the other hand ,",
    "the grains survive downstream of low velocity shocks .",
    "graphite grains are more sputtered than silicate grains for t=10@xmath22 k ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) therefore , in regions where strong shocks are created by the starburst , we will consider relatively large grains , e.g. silicate grains with an initial radius of 0.2 .",
    "small grains ( e.g. pah ) survive in the extended galactic regions on scales of hundred pc and lead to the features that appear in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .        in fig .",
    "2 the sed of bremsstrahlung radiation and emission by dust in the ir , corresponding to models in fig . 1 ( left diagram ) , is presented .",
    "some significant wavelengths ( in , top scale )  are also plotted ( thin dotted lines ) .",
    "the peaks of dust reradiation in the ir correspond to maximum grain temperatures of 314 k , 199 k , 143 k , and 41 k for  = 1000 , 500 , 300 , and 100 , respectively .",
    "notice that the bump corresponding to  = 100  is wide , because the grains are less sputtered for low  and a large region of grains emitting at low temperature is present downstream ( fig .",
    "the flux ratios between the dust bumps and the bremsstrahlung curve will change adopting different @xmath4 values .",
    "in particular , the flux from a starburst region at 2.3   hardly corresponds to dust , while for a high @xmath4 the flux at 3.2   accounts for both gas and dust emission .",
    "the clouds in the surrounding of a starburst are heated and ionized by the light of the stars with a distribution which depends on age ( cid fernandes et al .",
    "1992 ) , and by secondary diffuse radiation from the slabs of the gas heated by the shock .",
    "the clouds move outwards from the starburst and shocks form on the outer edge of the clouds .",
    "radiation heating leads to gas temperatures below @xmath23 k , while gas heated by the shocks can reach relatively high temperatures , depending on the shock velocity ( contini & viegas 2000 ) .",
    "the continuum emissions by dust and gas in the different frequency ranges must be consistent .",
    "therefore , we will adopt the following procedure .",
    "first we will model the line emission spectra from the gas and then will use the same models to calculate the continuum sed in all the ranges .",
    "the emission of dust in the ir depends on the intensity of the star cluster flux , on mutual cooling and heating by collision with gas , on the size of the grains which survive from sputtering , and on the dust - to - gas ratio .    in previous papers",
    "( e.g. viegas , contini , & contini 1999 , contini , viegas , & prieto 2002 ) it was shown that fragmentation of clouds in shocked regions results from r - t instability in a turbulent regime .",
    "therefore , the spectra emitted from the different regions of a galaxy are modelled by multi - cloud models , i.e. by models which account for the summed spectra emitted from single clouds adopting relative weights . the relative weight , which are defined by the best fit to the data , account for the relative number of clouds in the conditions determined by the model , and for the fraction of the emitting surfaces throughout modelling we will show the best agreement to the data of single cloud models in the different wavelength domains in the sed , in order to explain the role of each type of cloud .    indeed , the models leak a small scale fit to dust ir features corresponding to cirrus and extended ism regions which should be added .",
    "nevertheless , modelling gas and dust in a consistent way , provides a rough information of dust distribution in the different galaxies .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratios will be derived by the fit of the dust infrared bump consistently with bremsstrahlung at higher frequencies .",

    "some significant results , obtained by modelling the optical line spectra , are summarized in fig .",

    "notice that vv 114 s ( table 2 ) does not appear in fig .",
    "16 because all the clouds therein have the same velocity ( = 100 ) , with ages between 0.0 and 2.5 myr .",
    "the diagrams show that generally lower velocities correspond to early ages ( see viegas et al .",
    "1999 ) , out of ic 883 and ngc 6090 , which are dominated by relative old starbursts .    the d / g ratio peaks for clouds with = 200 .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of fig . 1 ( left panel ) which shows that for shock velocities @xmath10 300 dust grains are less sputtered . in high velocity environments",
    "d / g is partly reduced , although grains with a radius @xmath11 0.2  can survive in a small region downstream , close to the front of a = 500 shock . moreover ,",
    "ic 883 , ngc 6090 , and mrk 331 show that d / g ratios are lower in older starbursts also when = 200 . generally , low velocity clouds ( = 100 ) in young ( and old , e.g. ngc 6090 ) starbursts are less dusty .",
    "recall that d / g in the corresponding models are often upper limits ( e.g. ngc 1614 ) .",
    "in fact , these clouds are generally far from the starburst bulk , already merging with the ism .",
    "accordingly , ic 883 that is a compact object , does not show a low velocity component neither in the line spectrum nor in the continuum .    the relative contribution to the [ oiii ] lines from clouds corresponding to = 500 prevails in vv 114 n , ngc 3690 , and ngc 6090 ne .",
    "interestingly , in mrk 331 the contribution increases smoothly with .",
    "we would expect a relatively large fwhm of the [ oii ] line profile .",
    "moreover , the comparison of model calculations with the emission - line ratios shows that sulphur is depleted .",
    "generally , n / h abundance ratio higher than cosmic is indicated .",
    "the main results regarding the ir domain of the continuum sed , are the following :    emission from clouds in the neighbourhood of starbursts with @xmath27 myr and with shock velocities of @xmath0 500  explains both the bremsstrahlung and reradiation from dust in the mir .",
    "clouds with lower velocity ( 100 ) and corresponding to a lower age ( @xmath28 myr ) which contribute to the line spectra give a low contribution to the sed in the fir , while clouds with  = 200  are crucial to explain the fir bump due to dust emission .    by fitting the continuum sed we found that dust - to - gas ratios change in the different regions of single galaxies .",
    "we found that d / g ranges between @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( see sect .",
    "more specific results are given in table 12 .",
    "an old stellar population with  = 5000 k is revealed by black body emission in the optical - nir range of a few objects .",
    "finally , the data which correspond to the sed are not resolved enough to permit an analysis of absorption by ice and emission by pah .",
    "however , small dust grains corresponding to pah and graphite , and ice mantles are easily destroyed in a shock dominated regime close to the starburst , therefore , they are emitting from a farther extended region .",
    "the modelling shows that absorption by silicate at @xmath0 9.7  is strong for vv 114 e(4 ) , mrk 331 , and ngc 3690 .",

    "the frequencies corresponding to the maxima of dust reradiation depend on the shock velocity .",
    "however , the radiation from the starburst affects gas bremsstrahlung emission in the optical range .",
