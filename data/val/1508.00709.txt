    "low - temperature physics of correlated materials is often characterized by the competition between ordered phases and unconventional superconductivity .",
    "tipically , a static mean - field description , implying negligible fluctuations beyond the limits of the ordered phase , is not valid in these systems .",
    "nearly all dynamical probes show strong order parameter fluctuations , not only in the neighboring superconducting phases , which suggests a natural mechanism of pairing , but also in the strange metal , present at higher temperatures .",
    "lithium purple bronze ( lipb ) , adds the ingredient of quasi - one - dimensionality to the problem and suggests the possibility that charge and spin fluctuations alone , without the existence of real order , might be responsible of superconductivity and anomalies of the normal phase .",
    "the metallic phase of lipb , with chemical formula li@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 , has been characterized as a robust luttinger liquid ( ll ) in a series of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments ranging different temperature regimes , sample growth techniques , photon energies , and data analysis procedures @xcite .",
    "stm spectroscopy shows @xcite ll single - particle density of states and thermal and electric transport measurements are in complete disagreement with widemann - franz law @xcite .",
    "when temperature is decreased , an upturn of the resistivity occurs at @xmath5 k @xcite and the material becomes superconducting at lower temperatures around @xmath6 k @xcite .    unlike other low - dimensional bronzes ,",
    "the resistivity upturn of lipb @xcite is not associated with a lattice distortion ( see table 1 in ref . ) .",
    "neither thermal expansion @xcite nor neutron scattering experiments @xcite have identified a phase transition at @xmath7 suggesting the idea of a soft crossover of electronic nature .",
    "no gap has been clearly observed in the spectroscopies but optical conductivity measurements @xcite suggest the presence of a weak pseudogap .",
    "recently , thermopower @xcite and nmr @xcite experiments have confirmed different aspects of the quasi - one - dimensionality of this material but the nature of the upturn remains a mistery .",
    "the most recent study of superconducting properties @xcite confirms quantitatively that the large anisotropies observed in the upper critical field agree with those expected from the electrical resistivity in the metallic phase .",
    "the coherence lengths perpendicular to the chains are larger than interchain distances and @xmath8 increases monotonically with decreasing temperature to values 5 times larger than the estimated paramagnetic pair - breaking field .",
    "neither spin - orbit scattering nor strong - coupling superconductivity seem to explain this behavior suggesting the possibility of spin triplet superconductivity .",
    "a quantitative comparison with experiments @xcite shows that superconductivity can be destroyed through orbital effects at fields higher than the clogston paramagnetic limit _ provided _ that the superconducting pairs are in the triplet state . + in the last years there has been a very important theoretical effort @xcite to reduce the complexity of the unit cell to microscopic hamiltonians reproducing different aspects of this phenomenology . in this article , we present a microscopic theory for the unconventional superconducting properties observed in li@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "based on a minimal extended hubbard model introduced in ref .",
    ", we show that li@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 superconducts in the triplet channel when charge and spin fluctuations are enhanced , which may be also related with the upturn in resistivity at @xmath7 @xcite . using the random phase approximation ( rpa )",
    ", we identify the cdw pattern characterized by two ordering wave vectors , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in the proximity of those phases we evaluate and analize the superconducting vertex finding dominant p - wave triplet superconductivity with nodes on the fermi surface . within our methodology we find results compatible with the one presented in a very recent preprint @xcite",
    "the electronic structure close to the @xmath9 and the quasi - one - dimensionality of the system derives from two parallel zig - zag mo - o chains per unit cell @xcite fig .",
    "tight binding @xcite and dft @xcite band structure calculations agree that the mo - o orbitals of the chain give rise to four bands and two of them cross the fermi level .",
    "arpes confirms the quasi - one - dimensionality of the fermi surface .",
    "a slater - koster tight binding parametrization of the system has been propoposed in ref . and",
    "the role of long - range coulomb couplings in the anomalies of the metallic phase has been also studied @xcite . here , we consider a strongly correlated model , which can capture the essential physics of li@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite consisting on an extended hubbard lattice with 4 mo - atoms per unit cell , which reads : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the non - interacting tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "the one - electron hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of bloch waves with the following non - zero matrix elements , the intra - ladder : @xmath12 ev , and @xmath13 ev and the hoppings among chains : @xmath14 ev , as is shown in fig [ fig1 ] ( dotted cell ) .",
    "the diagonalized hamiltonian : @xmath15 , leads to four bands denoted by @xmath16 , the two lowest ones cross the @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the fermi surface , close to one quarter - filling , @xmath17 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ chi0 ] ( a ) .",
    "the coulomb interaction terms in the hamiltonian includes on - site hubbard interaction ( @xmath18 ) , intra - ladder interaction with the following non - zero matrix elements : @xmath19 and @xmath20 and inter - ladder @xmath21 interactions : @xmath22 and @xmath23 , as is shown in fig [ fig1 ] ( dashed cell ) .",
    "@xmath24    the interacting hamiltonian only includes density - density coulomb interaction contributions . within this work",
    ", we have consider several combinations of parameters , all of them leading to essentially the same results presented here where we reduce the parameter space to two variables ( @xmath18 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "we take the coulomb interaction among different sites with @xmath26 dependence , where @xmath27 is the distance among orbitals .",
    "therefore , we parametrize the interactions by weighting the v s with the interatomic distances : @xmath28 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]        values found for each @xmath18 . solid . the exponent in the luttinger density of states , @xmath29.,width=302 ]    to summarize ,",
    "we have studied a microscopic extended hubbard model for lipb .",
    "we have characterized the couplings promoting sc close to different charge ordering patterns . a detailed analyisis within the rpa approximation of the vertex shows triplet superconductivity with nodes on the fermi surface close to those ordered phases .",
