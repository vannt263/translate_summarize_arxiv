    "for example , nonlinearities can become important even in a harmonic lattice due to the interaction of an exciton with the lattice vibrations  @xcite , where impurities may appear as a result of doping of materials with atoms or molecules that have stronger local coupling .",
    "such impurities can also appear in ( inherently nonlinear ) spin - wave systems due to , e.g. , a local variation of the coupling between neighboring spins  @xcite .",
    "when both nonlinearity and disorder are present simultaneously , it is expected that competition between two different mechanisms of energy localization ( i.e. one , due to the self - action of nonlinearity , and the other one , due to localization induced by disorder ) will lead to a complicated and somewhat nontrivial physical picture of localized states and their stability . in this paper , we consider one of the examples of such a competition , and analyze different types of nonlinear localized modes and their stability in the framework of the generalized nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with a point - like impurity .",

    "@xmath290 can be defined as follows : @xmath291 we determine the temporal evolution of @xmath292 by following the standard procedure  @xcite and derive the so - called _ virial relation _ : @xmath293 { \\displaystyle \\quad      4 \\rho\\ ; \\frac{(2-\\sigma)}{(1+\\sigma ) }        \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } |\\psi|^{2\\sigma+2 } dx       + 4 \\beta\\ ; \\frac{(1-\\gamma)}{(1+\\gamma ) } i_0^{\\gamma+1 } ,   } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 and @xmath294 are the power and hamiltonian defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) and  ( [ eq : h ] ) , respectively , while @xmath295 here designates the intensity at the impurity site . because @xmath119 and @xmath294 are conserved quantities , eq .",
    "( [ eq : virial ] ) can be integrated when the powers of the nonlinearities attain the _ critical values _ : @xmath241 , @xmath240 , and linear defect response vanishes ( @xmath296 ) : @xmath297 where @xmath298 is the width of the input mode , and we assume that the initial mode profile does not have a phase modulation . if @xmath299 , it immediately follows that the mode width decreases and eventually vanishes at a finite time , indicating that the peak intensity goes to infinity since the power @xmath119 is conserved , thus the energy collapses to a single point   the impurity site .",
    "therefore , a negative value of the hamiltonian is a _ sufficient condition _ for collapse in this case .    if the power of the impurity nonlinearity is enhanced , i.e. @xmath300 , the corresponding term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : virial ] ) becomes negative , indicating an increase in the collapse growth rate .",
    "increasing the power of bulk nonlinearity above the critical value , @xmath301 for @xmath149 , or decreasing the self - defocusing response , @xmath302 for @xmath150 , we observe a similar effect . in all these cases ,",
    "the relation @xmath299 remains a sufficient condition for collapse .",
    "the same argument holds for a defect with linearly repulsive response , @xmath174 . on the other hand , as we have demonstrated in the previous sections ,",
    "a linearly attractive defect can support stable localized modes which do not exhibit collapse . in this case , and more generally when at least one of the last three terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : virial ] ) becomes positive , we can not directly use the virial relation to predict the collapse conditions .      in order to predict whether collapse is possible for arbitrary values of the nonlinearity parameters we may employ the connection between the collapse dynamics and the properties of stationary localized modes .",
    "first , we note that for the stationary solutions the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : virial ] ) is identical zero . for the critical case a perturbation of the solution that makes @xmath294 negative will result in a collapse .",
    "thus , the collapse may occur when the high - frequency symmetric localized modes are unstable . indeed , in the limit of high intensities we can neglect the linear impurity response by taking @xmath303 , and then an exact collapsing solution can be obtained ( at @xmath304 and @xmath305 ) in the form : @xmath306 e^{-i \\theta(x , t ) } ,   } \\\\*[9pt ] { \\displaystyle      \\theta(x , t ) = \\omega c \\lambda(t ) - x^2 { \\lambda(t ) } / { ( 4 c ) } ,   } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath307 , @xmath218 is an arbitrary positive constant , @xmath308 is the collapse time , and @xmath16 is the profile of a stationary localized mode with the frequency @xmath96 .",
    "although the solution  ( [ eq : slv_collapse ] ) is unstable and therefore does not describe the actual collapse dynamics , it demonstrates a link between the stationary modes and the collapse phenomenon .",
    "moreover , for a homogeneous self - focusing medium it was proved that an unstable soliton will collapse if its power is slightly increased ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "then , we arrive at the following statement : _ collapse at the nonlinearly attractive impurity can be observed if and only if the stationary symmetric impurity modes exist in the limit of high frequencies and their power is bounded from above _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath309 , where @xmath310 is a constant .",
    "we note , however , that the stationary modes themselves are not necessarily unstable in the case with the critical power of the impurity nonlinearity , as their power may asymptotically approach a constant from below ( see the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : pwr - sf - al_p - beta_p_s1g1 ] ) . finally , using the mode properties derived in sec .",
    "[ sect : power_nl_full ] , we determine the parameter regions where collapse can occur , and summarize these results in table  [ tab : collapse ]",
    ".      the infinite growth of the field amplitude that results from the collapse dynamics would not occur in a real physical system .",
    "however , in the framework of the model  ( [ eq : nls]),([eq : def_f ] ) we observe that collapse can be induced by an impurity even in a standard nonlinear kerr medium , i.e. , when @xmath311 , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse](a )",
    ". the final stage of self - focusing , preceding the `` blow - up '' , should be described by modified equations that take into account some _ additional physical effects which can no longer be neglected when the collapse is approached_. below , we consider two possible mechanisms for such a _ collapse suppression_.",
    "the first example is self - focusing of spatial nonlinear guided optical modes supported by a thin nonlinear waveguide embedded in a bulk kerr medium .",
    "when the field localization becomes very high , the delta - function can no longer be used to approximate the layer response , and then the nonlinear response should be modified as follows @xmath312 where @xmath313 is the layer width , and the layer response parameters are related to those used in the delta - function approximation , @xmath314 and @xmath315 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse](b ) , a decrease of the mode width and a growth of the peak amplitude stop when the energy gets localized inside the nonlinear layer .    as the second example",
    ", we study the energy localization in an intrinsically discrete system such as a waveguide array .",
    "it has been demonstrated that in homogeneous lattices the collapse and the infinite growth of the peak amplitude is always suppressed  @xcite .",
    "this happens due to the presence of a minimal transverse scale , the characteristic distance  @xmath316 between the lattice sites or , for the present example , the width of the individual waveguides in the array .",
    "therefore , when the width of the localized mode becomes comparable with @xmath316 , the evolution can no longer be described in the framework of the continuum approximation .",
    "therefore , the original model  ( [ eq : nls ] ) should be modified to take the form of the discrete nls - type equation : @xmath317 where @xmath318 is the site number .",
    "an example of the energy localization in a discrete system is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse](c ) .",
    "when the mode becomes narrow , its confinement is defined by the discreteness , and the final state corresponds to breather - like oscillations near a stable stationary solution of a discrete model .",
    "finally , we note that the initial stage of the collapse - induced dynamics is the same for all three different models , as is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse_intensity ] .",
    "it is also important to mention that the power of the high - frequency stationary localized solutions of the modified models  ( [ eq : opt_layer]),([eq : discrete ] ) is _ no longer limited _ , and thus the observation of collapse suppression completely agrees with our general criterion introduced in sec .  [",
    "sect : collapse_condition ] .",
    "we have analyzed spatially localized nonlinear modes supported by a point - like impurity , in the framework of the generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "we have considered three possible types of such nonlinear impurity modes , i.e. symmetric one- and two - hump modes and asymmetric one - hump mode , and described their regions of existence and stability , for both focusing and defocusing nonlinearity of a bulk medium and two different ( attractive or repulsive ) types of the impurity .",
    "in particular , we have obtained an analytical stability criterion for nonlinear localized modes based on the results of the linear stability analysis of the generalized nls equation . for more specific physical applications ,",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the nonlinear impurity modes and their stability in the case of the power - law nonlinearities in both the medium and defect , and discussed several scenarios of the instability - induced dynamics of the nonlinear impurity modes . in particular , we have described a novel physical mechanism of the energy localization due to the impurity - induced collapse of a nonlinear mode at the defect site , which can occur when the power of nonlinearity in the defect exceeds a critical value ( i.e. , @xmath319 ) ; this effect can be observed for the kerr medium as well .",
    "the problem we have analyzed above has a number of important physical applications ranging from the nonlinear dynamics of solids to the theory of nonlinear photonic crystals and waveguide arrays in nonlinear optics . in particular , our results",
    "can be linked to different special cases of the theory of nonlinear guided waves in layered dielectric media , and they provide also a generalization of the theory of nonlinear impurity modes in solids , together with a systematic classification of nonlinear impurity modes and the analysis of the mode stability and its instability - induced dynamics .",
    "additionally , this problem can be considered as one of the first steps towards a deeper understanding of the competition between two different physical mechanisms of energy localization . in particular , we have presented our results emphasizing the cases where one can observe a clear evidence of competition between the disorder- and nonlinearity - induced localization .",
