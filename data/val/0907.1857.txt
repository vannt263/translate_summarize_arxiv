    "recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of flat thin sheets which assume non - trivial configuration in the absence of exterior forces or impose boundary conditions .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed in different contexts : growing leaves , torn plastic sheets and specifically engineered polymer gels @xcite .",
    "the study of wavy patterns along the edges of a torn plastic sheet or the ruffled edges of leaves suggest that the sheet endeavors to reach a non - attainable equilibrium and hence necessarily assumes a non - zero stress rest configuration .    in this paper , we attempt to give a possible mathematical foundation of these phenomena , in the context of the nonlinear theory of elasticity .",
    "the basic model , called `` three dimensional incompatible elasticity '' @xcite , follows the findings of an experiment described in @xcite .",
    "the experiment ( see figure [ figura1 ] ) consists in fabricating programmed flat disks of gels having a non - constant monomer concentration which induces a `` differential shrinking factor '' .",
    "the disk is then activated in a temperature raised above a critical threshold , whereas the gel shrinks with a factor proportional to its concentration and the distances between the points on the surface are changed .",
    "this defines a new target metric on the disk , inducing hence a @xmath0d configuration in the initially planar plate .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of this deformation is the onset of some `` transversal '' oscillations ( wavy patterns ) .    trying to understand the above phenomena in the context of nonlinear elasticity theory ,",
    "it has been postulated @xcite that the @xmath0d elastic body seeks to realize a configuration with a prescribed pull - back metric @xmath5 . in this line ,",
    "a @xmath0d energy functional was introduced in @xcite , measuring the @xmath6 distance of the realized pull - back metric of the given deformation from @xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately , this functional is not suitable from a variational point of view , due to the existence of lipschitz deformations with zero energy level @xcite .",
    "these deformations are however neither orientation preserving nor reversing in any neighborhood of a point where the riemann curvature of the metric @xmath5 does not vanish ( i.e. when the metric is non - euclidean ) . in order to overcome this shortcoming ,",
    "here we introduce a modified energy @xmath7 which measures , in an average pointwise manner , how far a given deformation @xmath8 is from being an orientation preserving realization of the prescribed metric .",
    "an immediate consequence is that for non - euclidean @xmath5 , the infimum of @xmath9 ( in absence of any forces or boundary conditions ) is strictly positive , which points to the existence of non - zero strain at free equilibria .",
    "several interesting questions arise in the study of the proposed energy functional .",
    "a first one is to determine the scaling of the infimum energy in terms of the vanishing thickness of a sheet .",
    "another is to determine limiting zero - thickness theories under obtained scaling laws .",
    "the natural analytical tool in this regard is that of @xmath1 convergence , in the context of calculus of variations .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a first case where the prescribed metric is given by a tangential riemannian metric @xmath10 $ ] on the @xmath3d mid - plate , and is independent of the thickness variable . the @xmath0d metric @xmath5 is set - up such that no stretching may happen in the direction normal to the sheet in order to realize the metric . consequently , if @xmath10 $ ] has non - zero gaussian curvature , then such @xmath5 is non - euclidean .",
    "we further observe a correspondence between the scaling law for the infimum energy of the thin sheet in terms of the thickness , and the immersability of @xmath10 $ ] into @xmath4 ( theorem [ isoim ] ) .",
    "this result relates to a longstanding problem in differential geometry , depending heavily on the regularity of the immersion @xcite . in our context",
    ", we deal with @xmath2 immersions not studied previously .",
    "we also derive the @xmath1-limit of the rescaled energies , expressed by a curvature functional on the space of all @xmath2 realizations of @xmath10 $ ] in @xmath4 ( theorems [ liminf ] and [ threcseq ] ) .    to put our results in another context , recall the seminal work of friesecke , james and mller @xcite , where the nonlinear bending theory of plates ( due to kirchhoff ) was derived as the @xmath1-limit of the classic theory of nonlinear elasticity , under the assumption that the later energy per unit thickness @xmath11 scales like @xmath12 . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", the present paper provides the non - euclidean version of the same results under the same scaling law , and the @xmath3d limit theory we obtain is the natural non - euclidean generalization of the kirchhoff model .",
    "contrary to the classic case , in our context the scaling law is the unique natural scaling of the energy for the free thin sheet with the associated prescribed metric .    as a major ingredient of proofs",
    ", we also give a generalization of the geometric rigidity estimate @xcite to the non - euclidean setting ( theorem [ rigidity_main ] ) .",
    "we estimate the average @xmath6 oscillations of the deformation gradient from a fixed matrix in terms of the @xmath0d non - euclidean energy @xmath9 and certain geometric parameters of the @xmath0d domain .",
    "the main difference is an extra term of the bound , depending on the derivatives of the prescribed metric @xmath5 and hence vanishing when @xmath5 is euclidean as in @xcite .",
