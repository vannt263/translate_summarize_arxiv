    "game theory as a sub field in mathematics @xcite has enjoyed a tremendous growth and has been applied to wide range of fields such as economics @xcite , political science @xcite , biology @xcite , and computer science @xcite .",
    "the successful application of the theory in the classical context inspired formulation of quantum games @xcite",
    ". one key feature of a quantum game is that there are an infinite number of strategies possible , which can potentially lead to far more equilibria . in quantum game theory ,",
    "concepts from quantum information theory are applied to game theory such that qubits represent the states of each player , quantum gates ( unitaries ) are used for implementing strategies , and entanglement is used to mediate communication between the players .",
    "considerable interest was generated in this field when the quantization of a classical game using the eisert - wilkens - lewenstein ( ewl ) formalism @xcite showed that the classical prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) could be resolved by including a new quantum strategy that is not available in the classical game .",
    "we employ the ewl formalism primarily because it is widely used in the literature .",
    "this formalism quantizes the strategy space of a classical game as opposed to other approaches where the payoff function is quantized @xcite , which can be advantageous for directly comparing a quantum game to mixed strategy classical games .",
    "extension of a classical game into a quantum context gives rise to entirely new classes of games , depending on how that extinsion is made , and our focus here is again on games based on ewl formalism .",
    "there is also distinction between quantizing a classical game and gaming a quantum system @xcite as the former is concerned with applying quantum information to game theory , with the goal to learn something about the game that is produced , whereas the latter applies the rules of game theory to quantum physics , with the goal of learning something about the underlying physics .",
    "our approach is the former .    in this work",
    "we are focused on quantizing classical bayesian games that have players with incomplete knowledge about the payoff functions of their opponents .",
    "the uncertainty in knowledge of the players is encoded in types and priors or beliefs as classical probability distributions on types .",
    "formally , a classical two person bayesian game is a tuple @xmath2 where , @xmath3 represent the state and action spaces of the player , @xmath4 is space of types from which nature assigns one member for each player .",
    "lack of knowledge on the types makes this space a random variable and each player has priors or beliefs about it in the form of a probability distribution on it which is encoded in the probability measure @xmath5 .",
    "this results in players choosing a strategy from @xmath6 conditioned on the types and the cost function @xmath7 is a mapping on @xmath8 . later",
    ", we describe the quantum version of this bayesian set up , where the priors are still classical but @xmath9 and @xmath6 are based on quantum information .",
    "our approach is similar in spirit to the quantized bayesian game of battle of sexes @xcite where the probabilities are calculated in accordance with quantum mechanics and the priors are classical , however , their approach relies only on probability distributions , our approach retains the quantum mechanical formalisms of state vectors and operators .",
    "the primary advantage a quantum game has over its classical counterpart may be seen in the case of pd .",
    "when the initial state is maximally entangled , and the strategy space is restricted to those in the original ( ewl ) formalism @xcite , the payoff for the players at the nash equilibrium ( ne ) in the quantum game exceeds the payoff of the players at the ne in the classical counterpart .",
    "the ne is the set of strategies where no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy .",
    "it is possible in the classical game for the prisoners to choose strategies corresponding to a pareto efficient ( pe ) solution which gives higher payoff than the ne , though this is only with cooperation or a contract , which require communication and can be broken .",
    "a pe solution is a set of strategies where no player can benefit without , unilaterally or not , hurting the other .",
    "a second key feature of quantum games is that the player s initial states can be entangled .",
    "though we only look at non - cooperative games where the players act rationally and only in their self interest , the entanglement can ensure that the outcome of the player s strategy choices are correlated in a quantum mechanical way .",
    "once established , these correlations persist even if the players can not communicate , exhibiting the non - local characteristic of quantum mechanics . in some cases",
    ", the correlations produced from entanglement can not be described classically .",
    "the role of entanglement in a quantum game has been interpreted as a form of advice , contract , or mediated communication between the players @xcite , and is given by the referee . however , in contrast to classical game theory , the advice or contract is established before the players make their strategy choices by using an initial entangled state , after which , there is no communication between the players , and they are physically prohibited from breaking the contract .",
    "entanglement can also be thought of as an environment that acts to correlate the player s choices , since the entanglement is imposed by the referee .",
    "the solutions to the game can vary greatly with the amount of entanglement such that new ne form with partial entanglement that are different from those at maximal entanglement or zero entanglement , or can also lead to the complete absence of a ne for an entangled game even when the classical game has a ne , such as in the maximally entangled pd game@xcite .",
    "games with mixed strategies , that is , when the players choose the strategies with a probability , always have ne solutions , but may not have mixed strategy solutions for every possible probability distribution on the payoff functions . in other words",
    "there are distributions over the payoff functions that are not in the image of the mixed version of the original clasical game .",
    "one possible way to extend the games to realize other probability distributions over the payoff functions is to set up games where the strategies of the players are correlated by some form of advice or mediated communication . on the other hand",
    ", quantum games can realize every possible probability distribution on payoff functions through the use of entanglement which can facilitate correlated strategies .",
    "in fact , given one player s strategy the other player can choose strategies such that any possible distribution on the payoff function can be achieved@xcite , which can lead to the absense of ne in certain cases , such as in the maximally entangled pd game .    when there is incomplete information available to the players involved , the game can be treated using a bayesian approach @xcite .",
    "this produces a game that is a classical mixture of two quantum games .",
    "bayesian games have seen interest because they can be easily formulated to show a quantum advantage .",
    "this can be done by leveraging bell s inequalities such that the payoff function of the game is cast in terms of the expectation values of observables employed in a form of a bell s inequality .",
    "thus , by using quantum correlations , a higher payoff at the ne can be achieved than is possible using only classical correlations .",
    "this shows the advantage for quantum games when the payoff function has the form of a bell s inequality @xcite .",
    "we wish to study bayesian games in a more general framework in order to shed light on how the non - local advice via the entanglement , functions in a game with incomplete information .",
    "the ability to include multiple agents , allowance for incomplete information , and the incorporation of game theory concepts such as fairness or equilibria make quantum bayesian games a useful tool for quantum network , which features entangled qubits shared non - locally across multiple nodes . when interacting with multiple agents on a network , a game theory analysis is often justified because agents are typically free to make their choices in their best interests , perhaps mitigated by some referee .",
    "it is also often the case in interacting with multiple agents on a network , that the players will have incomplete information about the other agents , which rationalizes the approach to include a classical bayesian framework for prior information on a quantum game .",
    "the utilization of quantum games on a quantum network could potentially be used in applications such as the analysis of the quantum security protocols@xcite , the development of distributed quantum computing algorithms@xcite , or using non - locally shared quantum information to improve the efficiency of classical network algorithms @xcite .",
    "in addition there have been several experimental implementations of the two - player pd game within this framework using nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , quantum circuits in optical @xcite , and ion - trap platforms @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : classical ]",
    "we introduce the classical game we wish to quantize and summarize its solutions . in section [ sec : quantum ]",
    "we give some of the theoretical background necessary to employ a bayesian game within a quantum probability space .",
    "in section [ sec:1 ] we give details of the method we employ to find the solutions to the quantized game , where we vary the degree of entanglement and amount of incomplete information . in section [ sec:2 ] we present solutions to the two - player games where we find that the structure of each ne is comprised of a class of strategy choices related to one another by a phase relationship , giving rise to a class of ne between the two players . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we analyze the quantum bayesian game and find that the ne form a phase - diagram like structure in the amount of entanglement , and amount of incomplete information .",
    "the ne are found to have a complex and sometimes surprising structure within this phase diagram .",
    "finally we offer a discussion of what our results tell us about the role of entanglement and partial information in a quantum bayesian game in section [ sec:4 ] , and end with some conclusions .",
    "the bayesian game we considered here is a variation of pd , the district attorney s ( da s ) brother , which involves three players , or equivalently , represents a situation where player b does not know what type player a is . in the first case ,",
    "player a and b play the standard pd game . in the second case , player b believes player a is the da s brother which gives player a an advantage resulting in an asymmetric payoff between the players .",
    "first , we consider a version of the two - player pd game that is slightly modified from the canonical formulation such that the players have asymmetric payoffs .",
    "this has the payoff matrix given by :    [ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in addition , there are two blocks of parameter space where there are no ne .",
    "they are given by @xmath10 $ ] and @xmath11 $ ] and in the region @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the interpretation of a ne is that by playing rationally , the players in a game will tend towards playing the ne strategy choices .",
    "the ne is stable in that players do not have any incentive to deviate , and is thus self - enforcing .",
    "the character of the equilibria that arise when entanglement is present seem to bear resemblance to the concept in classical games of a correlated equilibrium@xcite .",
    "a correlated equilibrium in classical games is achieved when mixed strategies are employed and there is communication between the players in the form of advice or a contract .",
    "if players receive some piece of advice , or react in a predetermined way to a random event , they can employ strategies that are correlated with one another and realize self - enforcing equilibria that are different from those in the mixed game without communication .",
    "in contrast , our analysis includes only pure strategies and the role of the advice is played by the initial entanglement .",
    "when the player s qubits are entangled , the outcomes of the measurement following their strategy choices will be correlated in a specific way , determined by the type of entanglement .",
    "the entanglement is imposed on the players by a referee , and once it is initially established , no communication between the players is necessary , and in fact the players are physically prohibited from breaking the contract .",
    "the correlation will also persist even if the players make their strategy choices simultaneously and non - locally .",
    "in addition , the specific type of non - classical correlation , enabled by entanglement , can be such that the players can have correlated outputs that are not possible with classical probability distributions in the absence of communication .",
    "however , as the amount of entanglement is changed , the effect that the imposed correlation has on the structure of the ne can change dramatically . at zero entanglement , the quantum formulation of the game strongly resembles the classical game , with the players playing quantum strategies that closely resemble the classical strategy choices ( d , d ) . as the entanglement increases",
    ", the strategy choices of the ne do not change , rather , they continue to play the same strategies as in the case with no entanglement .",
    "thus , the contract enforced by the initial entanglement does not induce the players to play a strategy that is different than the one they would play if there were no entanglement , rather it ensures that the outcome of their strategy choices is correlated in a certain way .",
    "the conditions of the ne guarantee that the resulting equilibrium is self - enforcing .    as the degree of entanglement , or amount of correlation , is increased , one might expect that the effective contract is more strictly enforced or that the advice is more closely followed , leading to a larger benefit for the players at equilibrium .",
    "this is true for a while , but as in the two - player quantum pd game with symmetric payoffs , the nes are absent above a critical value of entanglement .",
    "this is similar to the phase - transition like behavior that has been seen in some quantum games @xcite , and should be investigated further .",
    "this also contrasts with an intuition of a classical game with correlated equilibrium , where one might expect that the more strictly a contract is enforced , the greater the benefit from that contract .    in the bayesian game , we see evidence of a structure with a much richer and sometimes surprising phase - transition like behavior that can occur both in the amount of entanglement , as has been seen in the two - player games , but also in the amount of incomplete information , i.e. @xmath0 . if only looking at the classical bayesian game , and the two versions of the two - player game , one would not necessarily predict that there is a region in the center with no ne , that new equilibria may appear ( i.e. @xmath14 ) , or how each of the ne will depend on the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath15 without solving for the full possibilities of the game .",
    "it is perhaps indicative of the structure of classical probability theory and quantum mechanical probability theory that the payoffs at the ne vary linearly along @xmath0 the classical probability and non - linearly ( i.e. as trigonometric functions ) along the quantum parameter @xmath15 , in which probabilities depend on the square of the components of the player s state ( i.e. wave function ) .",
    "the fact that the amount of entanglement can produce abrupt changes in the behavior of a quantum game underscores the importance of decoherence in a quantum game application , as the purity of the initially entangled state could dramatically influence the outcomes and the stability of the game .",
    "the behavior of the game can also abruptly changes as a function of the agents prior knowledge in a game , i.e. @xmath0 .",
    "this could certainly impact any algorithm taking place on a network , where knowledge of the motivations and abilities of the other agents on the network is incomplete .",
    "the structure as a result of the amount of entanglement is due to the constraints imposed by the referee , while the structure in the priors is dependent on the beliefs of the players .",
    "both are critical to the structure of the game , however , the referee can constrain the possible equilibria that may be achieved by adjusting the amount of entanglement , even if the player s preferences , i.e. payoffs , and prior knowledge remain unchanged .",
    "as stated earlier , each ne solution in the quantum game is an infinite class of equilibria with a fixed phase relationship and equal payoffs .",
    "there remains an uncertainty in exactly which equal payoff ne , i.e. which phase , the players will end up playing .",
    "this uncertainty can also arise in classical games .",
    "in several cases , there are multiple ne that are different payoffs , and that differ by more than just a phase relationship , such as in the da s brother game .",
    "the @xmath14 equilibrium in the bayesian game is an example of a ne that does not exist in the two - player games , and can occur simultaneously with other ne .",
    "when there are multiple ne , while playing a game , it would be possible for the players to be stuck on a lower payoff ne , as a local maximum in their payoff landscape , neither being willing to deviate .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the two - player da s brother game , or with the corresponding ne in the bayesian games , the multiple ne that exist have strategy choices which differ by more than a phase relationship and even correspond to different classical strategy choices . at lower entanglement",
    "they have distinct payoffs , but as the entanglement approaches maximal , the payoff converges to the same value",
    ". this could complicate the ne when the two players can not agree on which of the equivalent payoff ne to play .",
    "we have classified the solutions to a quantum bayesian game based on the prisoner s dilemma where there are multiple nash equilibria .",
    "the phase structure of the game in entanglement and probability space is non - trivial .",
    "the payoffs at these nash equilibria are dependent on the entanglement parameter and the probability to play with either player , and we have also identified some regions with the absence of nash equilibria .",
    "we solved for the phase relationships between the sets of strategy choices within each class of nash equilibria .",
    "we have seen evidence of a phase - transition like behavior of the quantum bayesian game varying both with the amount of entanglement and the degree of incomplete information .",
    "the relationship of the equilibrium solutions produced in the quantum game with entanglement to the correlated equilibrium in classical games should be explored further .",
    "the role of entanglement is often interpreted as a type of communication or contract , yet the correlations induced by entanglement persist even when communication is not allowed .",
    "entanglement is one of the more powerful and interesting properties of quantum mechanics and a referee may be able to expoit the effective non - local contract it forms in applications on a quantum network .",
    "the phase - like behavior of the quantum games should be investigated further to determine the nature of the phase transitions that occur .",
    "the player s beliefs , or their priors , can result in entirely different equilibria forming and the role of entanglement as a contract could potentially be elucidated by better understanding how the amount and type of entanglement , and the player s prior beliefs can lead to phase transition - like structures in the nash equilibria of a game .",
