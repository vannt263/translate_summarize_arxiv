    "in the description of structure function data the most conventional approach used is the collinear factorization theorem , where total cross - sections are determined in terms of parton distributions and hard parton cross - sections up to corrections of @xmath3 , i.e. higher - twist corrections .",
    "the most complete method is to perform a so - called global fit @xcite to all data sensitive to parton distributions , so that the consistency of the fit to a variety of different data sets is guaranteed .",
    "this is currently done at either nlo or nnlo in the strong coupling @xmath4 and appears to work very well . however , there are some indications @xcite that the procedure is a little unreliable at small values of @xmath0 where a resummation of large @xmath5 terms may be important @xcite , and by definition this whole approach fails at low values of @xmath6 ( where low appears to be somewhere from @xmath7 to @xmath8 ) .",
    "an alternative approach which circumvents the problem of low @xmath6 and is particularly applicable to small @xmath0 is the colour dipole approach @xcite .",
    "recently there have been a variety of fits , or at least comparisons , to small-@xmath0 structure function data using the dipole picture @xcite-@xcite . in this",
    "the free parameters of the fit are all mainly associated with the dipole cross - section , which it is very difficult to calculate from first principles but which may be modelled , with varying degrees , and different types of theoretical justification . if one also wants a finite photoproduction cross - section , a non - zero value must be chosen for the light - quark masses , appearing as a parameter in the dipole wavefunction which is calculated at lo , i.e. zeroth order in @xmath4 .",
    "it must be noted that in order to apply the approach to very low @xmath6 one must assume that perturbation theory is valid and higher order qcd corrections to e.g. the photon wavefunction are meaningful and under control in this limit .",
    "this is yet to be proved . with this caveat in mind",
    "it is true that a variety of approaches to modelling the dipole cross - section can be made to match data very well .    even though there is no essential connection , the dipole cross - section approach is often linked to , and used together with , the approaches which deal with parton saturation at small @xmath0 .",
    "it is commonly believed that the complications of small @xmath0 and low @xmath6 are entwined , with the assumed large parton distributions at small-@xmath0 leading to significant reduction of the evolution due to the mixing of leading - twist parton evolution with higher - twist multi - parton operators at low @xmath6 @xcite ( though it is fair to say that the values of @xmath0 and @xmath6 which are relevant are not so commonly agreed ) .",
    "there has recently been a great deal of work attempting , as far as is possible , to calculate the dipole cross - sections within this framework of large densities and saturation ( see e.g. @xcite , or for a slightly different viewpoint @xcite ) , and many of the dipole fits , including some of the most successful , are based on these ideas . in some quarters",
    "this has led to very strong claims that saturation has been discovered .",
    "however , there is a conundrum .",
    "this picture of steeply growing parton distributions at small @xmath0 and low @xmath6 tamed by saturation is in conflict with the conventional dglap fits which actually result in a small or even negative gluon ( and consequently @xmath9 ) at small @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is essential to understand this before making any strong claims for saturation .    in this paper",
    "i will investigate the cause of this inconsistency .",
    "i will base this investigation very much on the completely standard assumption that the qcd factorization theory is completely reliable , correct and quantitative at fairly high @xmath6 ( as long as @xmath0 is not too small ) .",
    "hence the parton distributions obtained from global fits must be quantitatively correct in this region .",
    "i will use the known relationships between the dipole cross - sections and standard parton distributions to work back from a fit to data performed in the dipole framework to obtain the corresponding partons .",
    "first , i will examine the question of whether a large / steep dipole cross - section actually means a large / steep gluon distribution , finding that the dipole cross - section is always steeper at small @xmath0 than its corresponding gluon distribution .",
    "this partially explains the differing conclusions obtained from the dglap and dipole approaches , but is not the whole story . in order to investigate the consistency of the two approaches",
    "i obtain a gluon distribution which evolves in the same way as a dglap gluon ( at least for reasonably high @xmath6 ) from a dipole model type fit to structure function data .",
    "i then make a comparison between the gluon distribution obtained at fairly high @xmath6 from this dipole model fit and the gluon from a standard set of parton distributions .",
    "this gives strong evidence as to whether dipole motivated fits are truly quantitative , and whether the results from these fits are to be taken seriously in detail .",
    "i find that the comparison between the two illustrates a serious discrepancy , and point out that the reason for this discrepancy is the approximation inherent in the lo dipole wavefunctions .",
    "i conclude that this result casts doubt on whether we should indeed treat the results of fits to hera data using the dipole picture as telling us anything truly quantitative , and i explain my reservations .",
    "improvements in the quantitative form of the gluon distributions obtained from dipole model inspired fits rely mainly on increasing the precision of the wavefunctions used to obtain the structure functions from the dipole cross - section .",
    "the relationship between the gluon distribution and the dipole cross - section was essentially worked out as soon as the dipole approach was proposed @xcite , but it is nicely discussed in a pedagogical manner in @xcite which explicitly shows the relationship between the dipole picture and the @xmath10-factorization theorem @xcite at lo , and also shows how this relationship breaks down beyond lo .",
    "my discussion partly follows this paper .",
    "the diagrams contributing to deep inelastic scattering at lo are shown below , where the incoming gluons have finite transverse momentum @xmath11 .",

    "lo we can investigate what the equivalence of the two approaches tells us .",
    "in the standard @xmath10-factorization theorem approach @xmath43 is given by eq.([eq : loktsimp ] ) , or its equivalent for @xmath44 .",
    "taking the mellin transformation with respect to @xmath0 of the intermediate expression eq.([eq : xsectiondip ] ) and using the equivalence we obtain f_i(n , q^2 ) = h_id ( ( _ s , n ) ) h_dg((_s , n ) ) g(n , q^2 ) h_i((_s , n))g(n , q^2),[eq : loequiv ] where @xmath45 comes from the probability of the photon splitting to the dipole , while @xmath46 comes from the relationship between the dipole cross - section and the gluon distribution in eq.([eq : dipsection ] ) .",
    "therefore , the effective coefficient function for the hard cross - section @xmath47 can be interpreted as the product of a photon - dipole coefficient function @xmath48 and a dipole - gluon coefficient function @xmath49 , both of which are calculable .",

    "the implications of this turn out to be rather interesting .",
    "each of these effective coefficient functions can be expanded as a power series in @xmath50 about @xmath51 , where each has been normalized so that @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath29 we obtain , h_2((|_s / n ) ) = 1 + 2.17 + 2.30 ^ 2 + 5.07 ^ 3 + 3.58 ^ 4 + 8.00 ^ 5+[eq : h2def ] in order to interpret this we need to know more about @xmath50 . strictly speaking ,",
    "these expressions are all derived within the lo in @xmath5 framework . in this case",
    "the gluon anomalous dimension is given by the lo bfkl equation .",
    "this results in the power - series expansion ( _ s / n ) = + 2.4 ( ) ^4 + 2 ( ) ^6 + 17()^7 + , where @xmath53 . in @xmath0 space",

    "this steep growth of @xmath54 as @xmath0 decreases leads to a quickly increasing small-@xmath0 gluon distribution as @xmath6 increases . however , substituting @xmath55 into eq.([eq : h2def ] ) we see that the effective coefficient function also grows quickly at small @xmath56 , or equivalently at small @xmath0 , and consequently @xmath57 grows quite a lot more quickly than @xmath58 with decreasing @xmath0 .    expanding the other expressions in eq.([eq : hdefs ] ) in powers of @xmath50",

    "hence , @xmath46 has a power series expansion in which all the coefficients are positive , and of rather similar size to those in the expansion of @xmath59 , whereas @xmath60 has a series expansion where the first two terms are small and negative , and higher terms oscillate .",
    "this has an obvious consequence .",
    "to a reasonable approximation all the small-@xmath0 enhancement of @xmath29 relative to @xmath58 is generated by the dipole - gluon cross - section , which is therefore itself steep relative to the gluon . in the final conversion from the dipole cross - section to @xmath29",
    "there is little change in @xmath0 dependence .",
    "= 0.75    in practice the lo bfkl prediction for the gluon is not really used in any realistic dipole model fits to data .",
    "it predicts a power - like behaviour at small @xmath0 of @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , whereas the sort of power - like behaviour used is @xmath63 .",
    "this means an effective value of @xmath64 which is extremely low for scales of a few gev , where @xmath65 , which is where the data exist .",
    "hence some models use behaviour implied by higher order corrections within the bfkl framework ( see e.g. the calculation in @xcite ) , and others just use models where the gluon is more closely associated with standard lo or nlo in @xmath4 perturbative qcd .",
    "some are more _",
    "ad hoc_. this departure from the lo @xmath10-factorization is already a deviation from the theoretical framework within which the simple dipole picture is valid , but i will essentially disregard this particular issue throughout this paper .",
    "whatever the inspiration for the ( unintegrated ) gluon distribution , in order to match even the most qualitative trends of the data one needs a gluon distribution that increases quickly with @xmath6 at small @xmath0 , and every model ultimately has an effective @xmath66 that grows quickly at small @xmath56 and equivalently at small @xmath0 . therefore , the general conclusion on the role of the effective coefficient functions made above is always true . since @xmath50 is positive and increasing at small @xmath0 , @xmath29 is always steeper in @xmath0 than @xmath58 , and this relative steepness is always associated with the step taking one from the gluon to the dipole cross - section , with the step taking one from the dipole cross - section to the physical structure function being largely unimportant as far as the shape is concerned .    this conclusion does not seem to have been made previously , but it is easy to demonstrate using the very simple dipole model proposed in @xcite . in this case",
    "the dipole cross - section is given by ( x , r^2 ) = _ 0(1-(r^2/4(x_0/x)^ ) ) , where , for the case of the realistic fit which includes charm as a parton rather than simply using three light flavours , the parameters obtained from the best fit were @xmath67 .",
    "this cross - section clearly saturates at large enough @xmath40 or small enough @xmath0 . using the relationship between the dipole cross - section and the unintegrated gluon distribution it is straightforward to obtain f_g(x ,",
    "k^2)=k^4(x / x_0 ) ^ e^-k^2(x / x_0)^ , and this expression is indeed used in @xcite .",
    "thus , whilst @xmath68 as @xmath19 , @xmath69 as @xmath19 , i.e. it has a valencelike behaviour @xmath70 as @xmath19 . using the leading twist relationship between the unintegrated and integrated gluon distribution , @xmath27 , and using fixed coupling ( the general result does not depend on this )",
    ", we obtain xg(x , q^2)= , which also behaves like @xmath71 as @xmath19 .",
    "this is slightly reminiscent of the valencelike gluons obtained in global fits , except that the valence - like behaviour will always set in at low enough @xmath0 in this model ( though extremely low @xmath0 for high @xmath6 ) , whereas in the dglap approach the valencelike behaviour soon disappears with evolution to higher @xmath6 .",
    "the behaviour of the dipole cross - section at large @xmath40 is compared to that of @xmath58 at low @xmath6 in fig . 1 , and",
    "one clearly sees that the eventual flattening of @xmath38 at low @xmath0 is accompanied by a distinct turnover in @xmath58 , with the maximum as high as @xmath72 at @xmath73 .",
    "it is certainly reasonable to argue that the simple relationship between the integrated and unintegrated gluons is not meant to be used in this case , since higher twist corrections to the gluon will be important .",
    "however , again this takes us beyond the regime where the strict equivalence between the dipole picture and the rigorously defined @xmath10-factorization theorem is valid .",
    "also , even if one doubts the result presented in terms of @xmath58 , it is certainly the case that @xmath74 is valencelike .",
    "hence , this simple example shows that the dipole cross - section becoming large at a small value of @xmath0 does not necessarily mean that the gluon at this value of @xmath0 is also large .",
    "this perhaps clouds the issue of what saturation actually means , i.e. does it have to mean a large parton density . however , it might also go some way towards explaining why fits including saturation corrections seem to be successful , while standard dglap fits produce very small ( or negative ) gluons , and small @xmath0 and @xmath6 .    in order to provide a definitive answer to this apparent contradiction",
    "it is necessary to undertake some rather more precise work .",
    "although the original golec - biernat wsthoff dipole model was successful with the hera data available at the time , it now produces a qualitatively good fit at best . and some of the more recent fits are direct attempts to improve it , e.g. @xcite . thus in order to make quantitative conclusions it is necessary to relate the gluon distribution and dipole cross - section from a genuinely good fit to current data .",
    "in order to make a detailed investigation i will work on the principle that reasonably high @xmath6 the gluon distribution will behave exactly according to standard fixed order dglap evolution .",
    "hence , i propose a simplified model for the gluon which accurately represents this but contains a minimum of parameters .",
    "i will then use the exact relationship between the unintegrated gluon distribution and the dipole cross - section in eq.([eq : dipsection ] ) , along with the standard identity , @xmath75 , valid at leading twist , in order to obtain the correct expression for @xmath38 . in the small @xmath76 limit @xmath38",
    "may be written as ( x , r^2 ) = r^2 _ s f(x,^2 ) ~ r^2 g(x,^2 ) , where @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath78 depends on the precise behaviour of the gluon , but it is always the case that @xmath79 . it should not be used as a free parameter in a fit .",
    "this expression is sometimes used to relate the gluon distribution and dipole cross - section .",
    "however , it is only ever approximate and only reasonable for very small @xmath40 .",
    "the completely correct eq.([eq : dipsection ] ) should really be used if one is going into the regime of large @xmath40 and or small @xmath6 and @xmath80 .    in order to attempt to obtain a matching between the dipole model gluon distribution and a dglap one at large @xmath6",
    "i define a gluon distribution which behaves like a conventional global fit gluon at high scales .",
    "i note that to a very good approximation at lo in @xmath4 the gluon anomalous dimension is @xmath81 , only differing from this approximate form significantly at very high @xmath56 .",
    "hence , the lo evolution is given by this anomalous dimension to a good accuracy except for fine details at the highest @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , apparently by accident the nlo correction to gluon evolution is very small , the coefficient of a possible term of @xmath82 happening to be zero .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for a flat input at scale @xmath83 the solution to the evolution equation for @xmath84 using this anomalous dimension is roughly xg(x , q^2)i_0((2.4_0 ( ) ) ^0.5 ) ( -1.5 ( ) ) , [ eq : das ] where @xmath85 , and strictly speaking @xmath86 is the value of @xmath0 above which the flat input gluon distribution falls away to zero , i.e. @xmath87 .",
    "this is a very good starting point for a more realistic gluon distribution .",
    "the main modification to be made is to round off the high-@xmath0 behaviour to something more like @xmath88 rather than a @xmath89 function at @xmath86 , and to take account of this in the evolution .",
    "also , i want a gluon that can be used all the way down to @xmath41 rather than stopping at some input scale , and which tends smoothly to a flat behaviour in @xmath0 as @xmath90 .",
    "this is achieved by modifying eq.([eq : das ] ) to xg(x , q^2)&= & a ( ) ^2(-1.5 ( ) ) + & & ( i_0(2.4 ( ( 1-(-))^4 ( ) ) ^0.5)-1).@xmath91 is the _ input _ , with @xmath78 the normalization .",
    "this is simply an empirical modification of an original formula which was theoretically correct in a slightly idealized framework ; and for moderate and high @xmath6 , i.e. above a few @xmath92 , the gluon does behave very similarly indeed to the standard dglap gluons coming from global fits .",
    "@xmath93 , which for the one - loop coupling gives @xmath94 , i.e. roughly the correct value , and hence it gets the speed of evolution correct .",
    "@xmath95 , and marks the transition scale around which perturbative evolution is beginning to break down . @xmath83 and the input shape @xmath96 are chosen to give roughly the correct phenomenological shape in @xmath0 and @xmath6 for the lowish @xmath6 gluon , but neither is at all fine - tuned .",
    "@xmath83 takes on a perfectly typical value for the scale of nonperturbative physics .",
    "it clearly serves the function of slowing the evolution @xmath97 , but does this in an @xmath0-independent way .",
    "i only make the change @xmath98 , independent of any consideration of @xmath0 .",
    "this model of the gluon is not therefore inspired at all by the idea of slowing evolution associated with high parton densities at small @xmath0 , and does not contain saturation effects .",
    "this expression for the gluon is converted into a dipole cross - section using ( x , r^2 ) = _ s(k^2 ) f(x , k^2)(1-j_0(kr ) ) , where for consistency @xmath99 is also slowed at low scales with the same regularization as the gluon .",
    "_ s(^2 ) = .",
    "the results of this paper are largely insensitive to the details of how the low scale coupling is regularized .",
    "the resulting dipole cross - section is then put into a fit to data .",
    "the normalization @xmath78 is the only really free parameter associated with the gluon in this fit .",
    "since the shape of the gluon has now been determined , we can investigate the relative shapes of the gluon distribution and the dipole cross - section without having to know the value of @xmath78 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 , where we see @xmath100 and @xmath38 for a variety of values of @xmath6 and @xmath40 . for the largest value of @xmath6 and correspondingly the smallest value of @xmath40 both @xmath58 and @xmath38 rise steeply at small @xmath0 , and",
    "it is difficult to see any particular difference in shape .",
    "however , at the two lower values of @xmath6 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , @xmath58 is clearly flattening out , and is rising very slowly indeed in the latter case .",
    "for the two larger values of @xmath40 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( which would naively correspond to @xmath6 of about @xmath105 and @xmath106 respectively ) , @xmath38 is clearly still rising steeply , and it is in this regime , which is where any saturation effects are supposed to be large , that the influence of the effective dipole - gluon coefficient function is clearly seen .",
    "it would seem easy to believe that saturation were occuring due to a large dipole cross - section , but seems less plausible that this could be interpreted as being due to a steeply growing density of gluons .",
    "there are a number of modifications required compared to the standard approach to fits to data made within the dipole picture in order to get a truly quantitative comparison to the conventional dglap approach .",
    "one extremely important issue is the treatment of heavy quarks , i.e. charm and bottom .",
    "these are often ignored in dipole fits .",
    "this is certainly excusable for the bottom contribution , which only really turns on above @xmath107 , and carries a charge weighting of 1/9 .",
    "however , charm contributes about @xmath108 of @xmath29 for @xmath109 , i.e. it turns on from zero to a very sizeable contribution indeed somewhere in the middle of the dipole regime , and to ignore it is ludicrous .",
    "however , the charm contribution to inclusive @xmath1 is often left out in dipole model fits . in the original @xcite fits ,",
    "two fits were made , with and without charm .",
    "the latter actually gave a worse fit , and the form of the dipole cross - section changed , the saturation parameter @xmath86 , i.e the value of @xmath0 at which saturation becomes very important at @xmath110 , changed from @xmath111 without charm to @xmath112 with charm , and the overall magnitude of the dipole cross - section decreased significantly , to about @xmath113 the previous value except at very large @xmath40 or extremely small @xmath0 .",
    "neither of these results is surprising .",
    "if one is missing up to @xmath108 of @xmath29 one would expect an enhancement of @xmath38 and @xmath58 of up to @xmath114 .",
    "since the leading saturation corrections are @xmath115 , one would then expect the saturation effects to be much exaggerated when charm is absent , as seen .",
    "decreases , from @xmath116 to @xmath117 in this case @xcite . ] for some reason the results of the dipole fits are habitually cited using the parameter values from the fits with charm absent .",
    "these parameters are simply wrong , and should not be used .",
    "moreover , they clearly suggest that saturation effects are quite a lot larger than the results obtained from the more correct dipole fits .    in order to investigate the importance of the charm contribution to inclusive @xmath1 i tried performing global fits with this contribution set to zero , i.e. mimicking what is done in many dipole fits .",

    "[ eq : h2wrong ] at reasonably high @xmath6 , and not too low @xmath0 , the first two terms dominate the evolution .",

    "alternatively , when performing a fit using this effective splitting function one obtains a smaller gluon than one should , particularly at moderate @xmath0 .",

    "this distribution is exactly what we would expect .",
    "it becomes larger than that in the dipole fit at very small @xmath0 because this fit is missing the contributions to the effective splitting function at @xmath176 and beyond .",
    "these are positive , speeding the evolution , and their absence allows the dipole gluon to be a bit smaller at the lowest @xmath0 .",
    "these terms , or at least their full form , should be there in a complete theory , so the `` true '' gluon should be the standard nlo gluon at high and moderate @xmath0 , but a little below this at the lowest @xmath0 .",
    "a probable , `` correct '' gluon of this form is also shown in the figure .",
    "indeed , the nnlo gluon is a little smaller than the nlo gluon at the smallest @xmath0 , and tends towards the probable gluon .",
    "this more `` correct '' gluon is hence a rather different shape from the dipole gluon , and this difference in shape would increase as @xmath6 is lowered .",
    "now that we clearly understand the reason for the mismatch between the dipole gluon and the dglap gluon at @xmath159 we can also understand why the dipole fit modelled on a gluon distribution that behaves correctly fails at @xmath145 . in this region the contribution at moderate @xmath0 to @xmath57 coming from eq.([eq : h2wrong ] ) is just too large when combined with a normal gluon evolution . in order to get a good fit to the structure function data ,",
    "the gluon at @xmath177 must actually fall with @xmath6 for @xmath145 .",
    "this is simply incorrect phenomenologically , but is achieved accidentally in some dipole models .",
    "similarly the very good fit at @xmath178 in dipole model fits is achieved with the wrong gluon , i.e. one can not rectify a discrepancy of up to @xmath163 over a short evolution range . at @xmath179 the missing terms in the splitting function eq.([eq : h2wrong ] ) are still by no means negligible , so the dipole extracted gluon can not be truly accurate here .",
    "it is also true that in this region there is no good reason to believe that the dglap gluons are very accurate either , and indeed they look rather odd .",
    "a quantitatively correct gluon in this range would require a more complete theoretical prescription than either approach ( and possibly any existing competitor ) currently provides .",
    "in order to obtain correct results from a fit to structure function data one has to be very careful .",
    "it is not difficult to obtain a good fit to the data , which are very smooth in @xmath0 and @xmath6 , and many people have done so since the hera data began to appear .",
    "it is even possible to do so using physics arguments that are demonstrably wrong .",
    "it requires far more care to obtain genuinely meaningful results with physical interpretations that are in any sense quantitatively correct , and input quantities that are determined to an accuracy where they may reliably be used in predicting other quantities . in this paper",
    "i have performed a fit using the dipole framework , and related this to the standard leading twist gluon distribution as accurately as possible in order to try to understand the seemingly inconsistent results of large , growing distributions at small @xmath0 in the dipole approach , and small @xmath0 valence - like and sometimes negative distributions in standard perturbative approaches at nlo and nnlo . in doing this",
    "i have investigated the degree of precision with which distributions can be extracted using the dipole approach and the amount of faith we should have in the quantitative conclusions of such fits .",
    "one major point to make , which should be self - evident but is very commonly ignored , is that when fitting to the inclusive structure function data one must use heavy quarks in the theoretical framework for the fits .",
    "the charm contribution to the structure function comprises up to @xmath108 of @xmath57 and alters the qualitative form of results .",
    "in fact , the standard dglap fit fails completely if this is left out .",
    "however , many dipole fits disregard it , overestimating the size of the dipole cross - section and the scale at which saturation occurs , even though the fit is good .",
    "also , it is pointless to show the success of the model in predicting the diffractive structure function , if charm is ignored in both calculations , as is sometimes done ; it must be included in the extraction of the dipole cross - section and in the calculation of the diffractive cross - section ( and certainly not in just one of the two , as is also sometimes done ) .",
    "if the correct inclusion of charm improves any results it might add weight to the evidence for a particular theoretical prescription .",
    "conversely , it seems suspicious if the inclusion of charm makes results worse .",
    "i discover two reasons which partially explain the apparent discrepancy between steep dipole cross - sections and valence - like gluons , which are nothing to do with any real discrepancy between the dglap approach and the dipole - motivated approach .",
    "firstly , it is more appropriate to think of the dipole cross - section as related to the combination @xmath180 rather than just the gluon .",
    "this is because unintegrated quarks in the nucleon can radiate gluons which then go on ( possibly with further radiation ) to take part in the scattering with the dipole . in the lo @xmath10-factorization theorem",
    "the gluon and quark contribute to this type of process in the combination above .",
    "this means that , even if at low scales the gluon is valence - like , the dipoles can pick up a steep behaviour from the quarks .    also , the effective coefficient function governing the size of structure functions in terms of the gluon in @xmath10-factorization may be unambiguously split into a structure function - dipole part and a dipole - gluon part",
    ". the full coefficient function ( or splitting function ) leads to a significant enhancement of the growth with decreasing @xmath0 , and it is found that essentially all of this appears in the dipole - gluon component . hence , for a given gluon anomalous dimension there is a calculable coefficient function which causes the dipole cross - section to be considerably steeper than the gluon distribution",
    ".    both these effects are in the direction needed in order to reconcile the dglap approach and the dipole approach . however , in order to test fully their compatibility i have constructed a model for the gluon distribution which evolves quantitatively like a dglap gluon for @xmath181 , but where the evolution slows down at low @xmath6 so that for @xmath153 @xmath182 and becomes flat in @xmath0 .",
    "this slowing of the evolution is achieved only by altering @xmath6 in the expression , making no special case of small @xmath0 and hence not invoking saturation type arguments .",
    "using such a gluon , a very good fit was obtained for @xmath183 . above @xmath159 a gluon with dglap type evolution used within",
    "the dipole approach becomes incompatible with data .",
    "the predicted cross - sections are too big at small @xmath0 for @xmath184 and @xmath185 , and some reduction is necessary here , possibly a sign of saturation .",
    "however , the gluon for the good fit is small , and not very steep at low @xmath6 . for @xmath186 and sensible values of @xmath187",
    "we never have the condition @xmath188 , i.e. the naive saturation requirement @xcite .",
    "i obtain the important result that the extracted gluon is much too small to match to a genuine dglap gluon at high @xmath6 .",
    "this real discrepancy between the dglap approach , which must be correct to a good accuracy for @xmath6 above @xmath189 ( at least until very small @xmath0 ) , and the dipole approach can be seen to be due very largely to inaccuracies in effective splitting functions or coefficient functions used when relating the gluon or dipole cross - sections to structure functions .",
    "they are expressions that are only really valid in the leading @xmath5 limit , and comparison with the exact perturbative coefficient functions and splitting functions shows clearly that they give structure functions which are too large .",
    "this affects both the size and the shape of the gluon and dipole cross - section extracted , and the error is greatest at the moderate @xmath0 values where the dglap gluon is most reliable , rather than at very small @xmath0 .",
    "the same problems in relating the dipole cross - section to the structure function exist at smaller @xmath6 , so even though the dglap gluon certainly becomes unreliable at low enough @xmath6 , the dipole cross - section and the resulting gluon are not truly reliable either .    hence , part of the discrepancy between the dipole approach and the conventional dglap approach is only an apparent discrepancy  the dipole cross - section being rather steeper than the gluon distribution at small @xmath0 , though this means that one can not immediately regard saturation due to a large dipole cross - section as being quite the same as saturation due to a large gluon distribution",
    ". however , part of the discrepancy is real , with the effective coefficient function allowing one to calculate the structure function from the dipole cross - section missing very important contributions which are present in the exact order - by - order in @xmath4 calculations .",
    "these contributions are really there , and should not be ignored .",
    "this consistent inaccuracy in relating the true dipole cross - section to the structure function data means that one can not have real faith in the quantitative size and shape of the extracted dipole cross - sections , and can only treat any claims about the suitability of a particular theoretical foundation based on a fit to data as justified in very qualitative terms .",
    "it has long been realized that one must go beyond lo @xmath10-factorization theory in a calculation of the gluon to get any sort of reasonable quality of fit , but it is necessary to do likewise for the wavefunctions in order to be at the level where one has genuinely quantitative results .",
    "there are various possible avenues .",
    "much work has been done on calculating the nlo @xmath10-factorization theory impact factors for photon - gluon scattering @xcite to go along with the nlo gluon kernel @xcite , and these would be useful in extending the validity of the formalism .",
    "the impact factors with exact gluon kinematics have already been calculated @xcite , and these could also give useful information about how to improve the calculational framework .",
    "it would be particularly interesting to compare these results with the complete nlo impact factors , once they are known , to see how well they predict the complete nlo contribution .",
    "if they are successful in doing this one might hope they would be a fairly accurate representation at even higher orders .",
    "however , i feel that , even if one is only fitting hera data at lowish @xmath0 , it is vital to use some calculational framework which combines both the leading terms in a @xmath5 expansion and the leading terms in an order by order in @xmath4 expansion ( along the lines of that used in e.g. @xcite ) to be truly accurate , since the latter are always important even at very small @xmath0",
    ". certainly , the use of corrections to the coefficient functions , such as those calculated using the exact gluon kinematics in @xcite , do increase the overall normalization of the gluon for a given structure function , as is required to obtain a closer match to the dglap gluon at high @xmath6 .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , the simple dipole picture does not really apply beyond lo in the @xmath10-factorization theory , due to the lack of diagonalization of the cross - section in the transverse position @xmath40 , and such calculations are still within the spirit of the @xmath10-factorization theorem , but are more difficult to interpret in terms of the dipole picture .",
    "hence , constructing a quantitatively accurate dipole picture cross - section seems to be a particularly challenging problem .",

    "<S> i investigate the relationship between the gluon distribution obtained using a dipole model fit to low-@xmath0 data on @xmath1 and standard gluons obtained from global fits with the collinear factorization theorem at fixed order . </S>",
    "<S> i stress the necessity to do fits of this type carefully , and in particular to include the contribution from heavy flavours to the inclusive structure function . </S>",
    "<S> i find that the dipole cross - section must be rather steeper than the gluon distribution , which at least partially explains why dipole model fits produce dipole cross - sections growing quite strongly at small @xmath0 , while dglap based fits have valence - like , or even negative , small-@xmath0 gluons as inputs . </S>",
    "<S> however , i also find that the gluon distributions obtained from the dipole fits are much too small to match onto the conventional dglap gluons at high @xmath2 , where the two approaches should coincide . the main reason for this discrepancy </S>",
    "<S> is found to be the large approximations made in converting the dipole cross - sections into structure functions using formulae which are designed only for asymptotically small @xmath0 . </S>",
