    "it is now known that the universe is not nearly as deficient in massive low surface brightness galaxies as was once thought , and that such ` ultra - diffuse galaxies ' ( udgs ) can be found in large numbers in rich clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the largest udgs have sizes similar to the milky way ( half - light radii around 3 kpc ) but only 1/100 to 1/1000 as many stars .",
    "these systems were originally discovered using the dragonfly telephoto array @xcite , which is highly optimized for the detection of low surface brightness structures , but the detection of most udgs is within the capability of conventional telescopes .",
    "the discovery of udgs has generated tremendous interest in the community , from observers who are rapidly enlarging the udg samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from simulators who must now try to understand the origin and evolution of these galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and even from alternative gravity researchers who claim their existence challenges dark matter models @xcite .",
    "the existence of so many presumably ` delicate ' udgs in rich clusters ( @xcite put their number at @xmath3 in coma ) poses the immediate question of why they are not being ripped apart by the tidal field of their host clusters",
    ". they may be short - lived and be on their first infall and about to be shredded , but this seems unlikely given their predominantly red stellar populations and smooth morphologies .",
    "however , two udgs in virgo show extended tidal debris and appear to be in the process of being tidally stripped @xcite .",
    "if they have survived for several orbits in a rich cluster , then simple stability arguments suggest that they must have significantly higher masses than implied by their stellar populations ; in fact , in order to survive , their dark matter fractions need to be @xmath4 @xcite within their half - light radii , suggesting they are ` failed ' @xmath5 galaxies .",
    "at least two objects in coma , dragonfly 17 @xcite and dragonfly 44 @xcite show strong evidence ( high velocity dispersions or large globular cluster populations , or both ) for being resident within very massive halos .",
    "so for at least two udgs the ` failed giant ' picture appears to be plausible .",
    "however , these may be extreme cases @xcite , with more typical udgs being better described as ` inflated dwarfs ' , whose anomalously large sizes are due to extreme feedback - driven outflows @xcite , unusually high spins @xcite , or tidal disruption @xcite . at present",
    ", very little is known about the characteristics of udgs , and it is not clear what fraction of them are ` failed giants ' , ` inflated dwarfs ' , or some other phenomenon .",
    "another relatively newly discovered population of low - mass objects lies at the opposite end of the selection function from udgs .",
    "these ` ultra - compact dwarfs ' ( ucds ) have characteristics reminiscent of both the nuclei of low - mass galaxies @xcite , and massive globular clusters ( gcs ) , and they may well have a connection to both populations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with an eye towards better understanding the nature of both udgs and ucds , in this paper we investigate the ` extreme ' galaxy populations in abell 2744 using data obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) frontier fields ( ff ) program .",
    "a2744 , also known as the pandora cluster , is one of the most massive ( virial mass @xmath6 , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and most disturbed galaxy clusters known @xcite .",
    "its intracluster light fraction is high at @xmath7 @xcite , with a mass surface density of @xmath8 and a stellar population consistent with the disruption of @xmath5 galaxies @xcite .",
    "these properties suggest a2744 is an ideal location to search for udgs and ucds at a look - back time of @xmath93.5 gyr and we seek to learn whether its extreme characteristics may have left an imprint in its population of udg and ucd galaxies .",
    "in this paper , we adopt a @xmath10cdm cosmology with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and a redshift for a2744 of @xmath14 , which corresponds to @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab system .",
    "galactic extinction corrections from the @xcite extinction maps were applied to all magnitudes .",
    "the _ hst _ ff program has produced the deepest images to date of galaxy clusters and gravitational lensing for six clusters along with six parallel blank fields offset from each cluster @xcite .",
    "each cluster and parallel field were observed for 70 orbits with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in f435w , f606w and f814w , and 70 orbits with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) in f105w , f125w , f140w and f160w .",
    "the filters with the deepest coverage are f814w , f105w and f160w .",
    "we use the higher resolution 30 mas scale v1.0 images with the  self - calibration \" applied to the acs images and the time variable sky correction applied to the wfc3 images ( koekemoer et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "the 30 mas images properly sample the acs point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we note that despite being offset @xmath17 west of a2744 s core , the parallel field is well within a2744 s virial radius ( @xmath18 , * ? ? ?",
    "to supply background corrections , we relied on the _ hst _ extreme deep field ( xdf , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is the deepest image of the sky to date in the optical / near - ir , and was obtained by stacking data from 19 different _ hst _ programs spanning 10 years covering the hubble ultra - deep field .",
    "the xdf has acs coverage in f435w , f606w , f775w , f814w and f850lp , and wfc3 coverage in f105w , f125w , f140w and f160w .",
    "only 60 mas scale images are available for all filters .",
    "for the a2744 cluster and parallel field , we ran sextractor @xcite in dual image mode on the 30 mas images using the f814w image as the detection image for all bands . to detect extended low surface - brightness objects , ` detect_minarea ` was set to 20 pixels , and ` detect_thresh ` and ` analysis_thresh ` were both set to 0.7 times the background rms .",
    "backgrounds were measured in local annuli 24 pixels thick .",
    "the xdf s f814w depth is relatively shallow , so instead we used f775w as the detection band .",
    "the 60 mas pixels are 4 times the area so ` detect_minarea ` was set to 5 pixels .",
    "psfex @xcite was used to fit the psf across the f814w a2744 cluster and parallel field images .",
    "stars were selected from a more conservative sextractor catalog with @xmath19 and @xmath20 using the cuts @xmath21 pixels , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "for the xdf , we again used the f775w image with the same parameters as the a2744 ff , except we used @xmath24 pixels to select the psf stars .",
    "udg candidates were selected based on their half - light radii and peak surface - brightness .",
    "our approach is essentially that adopted by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter vdb16 ) , with minor adaptations needed to account for the fact that our observations are based on data obtained with _",
    "hst_. in brief , we followed a four - stage process : ( 1 ) low - surface brightness candidates were selected using sextractor .",
    "( 2 ) candidates were then filtered on the basis of colour to isolate systems with rest - frame colours consistent with quiescent galaxies at the redshift of a2744 .",
    "( 3 ) structural parameters were obtained for the remaining candidates in order to extract systems with sizes larger than 1.5 kpc , absolute @xmath25-band mean surface brightnesses between @xmath26 and srsic index @xmath27 .",
    "( 4 ) obvious image artifacts were discarded using visual inspection .",
    "we now describe each of these four steps in some detail .                 1 .   in the first step of our selection procedure , we conservatively selected all objects large enough to conceivably be a udg using the following sextractor parameter cuts : @xmath28 ( allowing blended objects and objects with nearby neighbours ) and @xmath29 pixels , corresponding to @xmath30 at @xmath14 .",
    "udgs are known to be red ( @xcite ; vdb16 ) .",
    "so in the second step we used a2744 s red sequence to define a colour cut which allowed us to isolate the udg candidates in the a2744 cluster and parallel fields .",
    "this was done by applying a linear fit to the bright end of the @xmath31 red sequence defined using astrodeep @xcite photometric redshifts @xmath32 and selecting objects with colours between @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the red sequence .",
    "no such cut was applied to data from the xdf ( and , as will be shown below , none was needed , as the xdf contains very few udgs ) .",
    "the next step in our udg galaxy selection relied on structural parameter fits to further isolate udg candidates .",
    "we ran galfit @xcite on each candidate to fit a single component srsic model to each f814w image ( f775w for the xdf ) .",
    "we used the sextractor segmentation map to mask other detections and models were convolved with a psf defined by using psfex to produce a model psf at the location of each udg candidate .",
    "the resulting effective radii were circularized using @xmath35 .",
    "surface brightness was characterized using @xmath36 , the absolute mean surface - brightness within @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we transformed our surface brightnesses from f814w ( f775w for the xdf ) to @xmath25 assuming a star - formation history given by a simple stellar population ( ssp ) with @xmath38 = -0.6 $ ] , an age of 6.7 gyr at @xmath0 , and a @xcite imf .",
    "following vdb16 , we used cuts of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and srsic index @xmath41 to produce a set of udg candidates . corresponds to @xmath42 at @xmath43 , the mean redshift of the clusters studied in vdb16 . ] since udgs are round @xcite , we also removed objects with axis ratios @xmath44 to remove edge - on disks and lensing arcs .",
    "a total of 65 udg candidates were found in the a2744 cluster field , 63 in the parallel field , and 30 in the xdf .",
    "each candidate was visually inspected and classified into the following categories : ( i ) udg ; ( ii ) possible udg / poorly fit object ; ( iii ) image artifact .",
    "most objects in the third category were due to spurious features in the low signal - to - noise regions at the edges of the frames .",
    "after the final visual inspection , we find a total of 76 udgs in a2744 ( 41 in the cluster field , 35 in the parallel field ) , while just 4 udgs are found in the xdf .",
    "all but one of our visually inspected udgs have a photo-@xmath45 in the astrodeep catalog , and 63 have @xmath46 .",
    "the circularized sizes and mean surface brightness of all objects in our sample are shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : galfit ] .",
    "the black lines show our size and surface brightness cuts ( step 2 in our procedure above ) . for comparison",
    ", we also show the coma udgs from @xcite in light grey . since the purpose of the xdf observations was to determine the level of background contamination from field udgs , the physical sizes of xdf objects were calculated assuming they are at the same redshift as a2744 .",

    "they are also expected to be predomininantly found near the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) . therefore , to detect point sources near the bcgs , we applied a 15 pixel median filter to the a2744 cluster image and subtracted this off to remove low - frequency power ( e.g.  from intracluster light and galaxy halos ) from the image .",
    "sextractor was then run in dual image mode using the median filtered image as the detection image using @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "point sources were identified on the basis of image concentration , @xmath48 , given by the difference in an object s magnitude determined with 3 pixel and 7 pixel diameter apertures .",
    "point sources were obtained using the cuts @xmath28 and @xmath49 .",
    "object magnitudes were determined using 4 pixel ( @xmath50 ) diameter apertures .",
    "an aperture correction of 0.88 magnitudes was applied by first finding the correction from a @xmath50 to a @xmath51 diameter aperture using our psfex psf , and then correcting from a @xmath51 diameter to infinity using table 5 in @xcite .",

    "[ fig : mass_scaling ] , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the wfc3 coverage of a2744 and its parallel field contain 76 systems that are classified as udgs using the objective criteria noted above .",
    "the observations sample only a small portion of a2744 within @xmath52 , so this number must be corrected for geometrical incompleteness .",
    "since , as shown below , the radial surface density of udgs appears relatively flat , we simply divide the number of observed udgs by the fraction of a2744 observed within @xmath52 and subtract off the expected number of background udgs in this area . therefore , after applying a geometrical and background correction , a2744 contains @xmath53 udgs .",
    "this is about 10 times the number that exist in coma .",
    "recently , vdb16 showed that the number of udgs in nearby clusters scales nearly linearly ( in log space ) with the mass of the cluster ( interior to @xmath54 , the number of udgs scales as @xmath55 ) . adding a2744 ( @xmath56 ) allows us to extend this relation by 0.7 dex , as shown in figure [ fig : mass_scaling ] , which overplots our a2744 number on top of the relation of vdb16 .",
    "we include udgs in coma and fornax by applying our selection to the @xcite and @xcite catalogs , respectively , the numbers in a168 and ugc842 @xcite , and three hickson compact groups @xcite . for fornax",

    "we assume udgs follow the same profile and that it continues to be flat to @xmath52 . ]",
    "out to @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "a2744 contains about twice the number of udgs predicted by the vdb16 relationship , although the errors are large and the deviation from the relationship is not significant .    recently , @xcite studied compact ( fwhm @xmath58 400 pc ) objects within the a2744 cluster field ( using the parallel field for background subtraction ) .",
    "these sources are concentrated around the brightest cluster galaxies , confirming their membership of a2744 .",
    "they detected thousands of sources ranging from a faint limit of around f814w @xmath9 29.5 to f814w @xmath9 27 . by fitting a standard globular cluster luminosity function with a peak at f814w = 33.0 ( some 3.5 mags below the detection limit ) and extrapolating to f814w = 27",
    ", they concluded that a2744 contained @xmath59 ucds , and a total number of @xmath60 globular clusters .",
    "however , the assumption of a standard gaussian gclf extrapolated to bright magnitudes implies that a significant number of their gcs have masses greater than @xmath61 ( a widely accepted upper mass cutoff for a gc ) , and it seems much more likely to us that the vast majority of the objects identified by @xcite are ucds .",
    "we note that within 300 kpc of the fornax cluster centre , the number of ucds with masses @xmath62 is 24 @xcite , and similarly in virgo , there are 31 @xcite . scaling by the relative cluster masses and the predicted relation of pfeffer et al .",

    "this is inconsistent with the 147 ucds identified by @xcite .",
    "however , our estimate of @xmath63 ( figure [ fig : ucd ] ) ucds with masses between @xmath64 and @xmath65 within 300 kpc of the cluster centre ( including a background correction from the parallel field ) lies between these two extremes .",

    "at least one udg in a2744 appears to be nucleated ( top right of figure [ fig : stamps ] ) .",
