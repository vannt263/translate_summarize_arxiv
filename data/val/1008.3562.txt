    "indirect searches for physics at scales not directly accessible have proved to be fruitful in the past as , for instance , the successful prediction of the top quark mass from radiative corrections has shown . above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , new physics",
    "not directly observed can be probed by parameterising its effects in terms of an effective lagrangian involving only the standard model ( sm ) fields and invariant under the sm gauge symmetry @xmath19  @xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 are dimension - six gauge - invariant operators , @xmath22 is the new physics scale and @xmath23 are complex constants .",
    "effects of dimension - eight and higher - order operators are suppressed by at least @xmath24 , and are ignored in this work .",
    "dimension - six gauge - invariant operators were classified in refs .",
    "@xcite , totalling 81 operators up to ( many combinations of ) flavour indices .",
    "later , several of these operators have been found to be redundant  @xcite and the original list has been significantly reduced .    for top physics ,",
    "the most relevant dimension - six operators are ( i ) those yielding top tri - linear couplings with a @xmath25 , @xmath26 , photon , gluon or higgs boson ; ( ii ) four - fermion ones .",
    "the former have been classified in refs .",
    "@xcite and a minimal set of top anomalous couplings has been obtained by dropping redundant operators . for the latter ,",
    "the aim of this paper is precisely to perform such a classification , concentrating on the operators involving one or two top quarks .",
    "these operators can mediate top three - body decays , single top production in association with a light quark and top pair production .",
    "they will therefore be probed with a high precision at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , which is expected to produce top quarks copiously .",
    "the phenomenology of top - gauge boson operators using a minimal basis has been investigated in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . for four - fermion operators",
    ", there is yet a wide field to be explored .",
    "we will begin our task by writing down a new , completely general , basis for dimension - six four - fermion operators .",
    "we will prove that it is equivalent to previous ones  @xcite with some redundant operators dropped and few operator replacements which make our basis more `` symmetric '' .",
    "we will find some advantages when using it .",
    "first , amplitude calculations are more straightforward , as the colour and isospin structures at the operator level are simpler .",
    "secondly , the results obtained for many observables of interest ( as for instance cross sections and decay widths ) are very simple in this basis due to its symmetry , and interferences between operators and also with sm contributions are trivial in most cases . for specific processes a different , particular operator selection may reduce further the interferences and give slightly more compact expressions but , in general , the expressions obtained in our basis are quite simple , given the large number of parameters involved . and , in any case , expressions for observables in terms of a different operator set are straightforward to obtain , as we will occassionally do in order to compare with previous literature .",
    "after introducing our basis we will classify all four - fermion operators which give contributions to the effective lagrangian involving one or two top quarks .",
    "taking into account the different fermion chiralities , colour contractions and independent flavour combinations , a total number of 572 gauge - invariant operators are involved .",
    "but remarkably , all the contributions to the lagrangian we are interested in can be neatly summarised in few tables of easy reading , which we expect will be useful for future four - fermion operator studies , at the very least for bookkeeping purposes .",
    "this classification allows to easily find out which gauge - invariant operators generate four - fermion terms with one top quark , with two top quarks , or both , and the relations between these contributions implied by gauge symmetry .",
    "the type of the terms generated determines the processes to which gauge - invariant operators can contribute , and in which their presence can be probed .",
    "thus , relations between four - fermion contributions imply relations between processes in which new physics may manifest itself .    as a first application of this classification , we calculate all three - body top decay widths , single top and top pair cross sections in @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 collisions , including dimension - six four - fermion operators , the sm contribution and their interference .",
    "they are :    * charged current decays @xmath27 , @xmath1 and production processes @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( the charge conjugate processes are also understood ) .",
    "they involve sm contributions , which are very suppressed by small cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing angles @xmath28 for @xmath29 , as well as four - fermion ones .",
    "* flavour - changing neutral ( fcn ) decays @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and production processes @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 which do not take place at the tree level in the sm and are suppressed at one loop by the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani mechanism  @xcite . in this case , sm contributions can be safely neglected .",
    "( strictly speaking , four - fermion amplitudes do not involve neutral currents , but it is still useful to use this notation for processes with four quarks of charge @xmath30 . ) * top pair production processes : @xmath31 production @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath18 , which have a sm contribution , and like - sign top pair production @xmath17 which is absent in the sm at the tree level .",
    "in particular , we give expressions to calculate the top forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry at tevatron including all contributing four - fermion operators .",
    "the explicit expressions provided for these observables are relatively simple .",
    "nevertheless , there are a plethora of processes studied and keeping a reasonable paper length requires some amount of compact notation , giving observables such as cross sections in terms of gauge - invariant operator coefficients and numerical factors , collected in tables for lhc with a centre of mass ( cm ) energy of 14 and 7 tev , and for tevatron .",
    "it is not our aim to explore the phenomenological consequences of the results derived in this paper , although we will in some cases comment about the implications of these results .",
    "such studies , to be properly addressed , require either to treat the independent parameters ( operator coefficients ) as effectively independent , or a well - based assumption regarding the relations among them .",
    "after all , a gauge - invariant operator basis is a basis in which heavy new physics contributions can be parameterised .",
    "one would not expect that any kind of new physics , when integrated out from the lagrangian , yields effective operators with unrelated coefficients , all of the same order and without `` cancellations '' . on the contrary ,",
    "the opposite behaviour is often found  @xcite : heavy new physics when integrated out gives effective operators with correlated coefficients . with this philosophy",
    ", we will ignore the common prejudice which sets to zero the coefficients of operators containing terms which could affect @xmath34 physics , invoking the absence of cancellations between effective operator contributions .",
    "that possibility , which may appear to be a `` fine tuning '' , may well be only an effect of the choice of basis .",
    "examples are known  @xcite for which these apparent cancellations are not only natural but _ required _ by the nature of the new heavy physics which is integrated out to yield effective operators .",
    "a final point deserves mention here . in our calculations we keep terms linear in operator coefficients , proportional to @xmath35 , and quadratic ones proportional to @xmath24",
    "this is not inconsistent despite the fact that we ignore dimension - eight and higher - order operators . for processes without a sm contribution , and for fermion chiralities which do not interfere with the sm amplitudes , the lowest - order term is the @xmath24 one , and higher - dimension operators give contributions suppressed by higher powers of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the expansion is consistent . for fermion chiralities interfering with the sm ,",
    "dimension - six operators give linear @xmath35 and quadratic @xmath24 terms , while dimension - eight operators would give @xmath24 and @xmath36 contributions . in this case ,",
    "@xmath24 terms are sub - leading and could be dropped , but we still keep them ( there is no harm in doing that , and they can always be discarded a posteriori ) as part of a complete calculation to order @xmath24 , with some missing @xmath24 contributions from dimension - eight operators interfering with the sm amplitude .    the necessity to keep quadratic terms in calculations should be clear for many reasons . first , there are many new physics effects that can not be properly addressed only with the operators interfering with the sm .",
    "actually , operators which do not have interference with the sm are the ones mediating genuinely new physics effects , beyond corrections to sm processes .",
    "fcn processes , which are extremely suppressed within the sm , constitute one classical example but there are several other ones , as chirality - breaking effects for light quarks ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "such effects , absent in the sm , could then be visible even if suppressed by @xmath24 .",
    "on the other hand , nothing guarantees that , if new heavy physics manifests itself at low energies , it can be parameterised precisely by the operators interfering with the sm .",
    "a third reason is that , as we will find in the following , the quadratic @xmath24 corrections from non - interfering operators can be in some cases as large as the linear @xmath35 corrections from interference terms .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we write our four - fermion operator basis and in section  [ sec:3 ] we classify the four - fermion contributions to the lagrangian involving one or two top quarks .",

    "this obviously simplifies amplitude calculations because the @xmath75 colour sums do not have to be done case by case .",
    "but a more important advantage is that operators with the same quark fields but different colour contractions , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath76 and @xmath71 , correspond to the two possible colour flows in the four - fermion amplitudes and only interfere when all colours are equal .",
    "these interferences are trivial ( 100% constructive ) , take the same form in most processes and are easy to parameterise .",

    "in this paper we have thoroughly studied the role of gauge - invariant four - fermion operators in top physics .",
    "the first difficulty one has to address in such a study is merely to collect all the relevant four - fermion operators , which is cumbersome because of the large number of flavour combinations , not all of them independent , that can be written .    we have used a new , minimal four - fermion operator basis , which offers some advantages for calculations , to classify all gauge - invariant four - fermion operators giving terms with one or two top quarks . ( only a handful of operators give three or four top quarks , and their classification is straightforward . ) we have given our results in several compact tables in which the lagrangian terms can be directly read by intersecting the desired row and column . having all the possible terms classified represents a good share of the work needed for any calculation , and so we expect that the tables provided will be useful for future studies .",
    "a bonus of this classification is that contributions from the same gauge - invariant operators to different channels can be easily related . just as an example",
    ": we can identify which operators produce @xmath99 terms ( and thus contribute to single top production ) , which ones give @xmath100 terms ( contributing to top pair production ) and those producing both .",
    "we have gone beyond the classification , which is already important on its own , to provide calculations of all decay widths , single top and top pair production cross sections mediated by four - fermion operators , including the sm contribution when present .",
    "these calculations will be valuable to guide future more detailed simulations , not only to have `` reference '' numerical values to compare with , but also to identify the most useful channels and the relevant operators which can be probed . in this respect",
    ", we have found that in @xmath101-channel single top and @xmath31 production there are four - fermion operators which do not interfere with the sm amplitudes but whose quadratic @xmath24 contributions to the cross sections can be as large as the linear @xmath35 ones from the interfering ones . as we have argued in the introduction , quadratic corrections from such operators can and",
    "must be included in a complete analysis , even if we have ignored sub - leading effects from dimension - eight operators .",
    "the phenomenological implications of our results have not been fully addressed , for example providing expected limits on operator coefficients .",
    "this work is left for future detailed studies .",
    "still , there are several interesting points which are worth remarking here :    1 .",
    "four - fermion terms with fields @xmath102 ( including @xmath103 ) and @xmath104 will be better probed in single top production than in top decays . in the former case , they contribute to sm @xmath105- and @xmath101-channel production , while in the latter they mediate new , fcn processes .",
    "four - fermion terms @xmath106 ( including @xmath107 ) can only be probed in top decays . moreover ,",
    "some of the gauge - invariant operators producing these terms , for example @xmath108 , can not be investigated in other processes as single top or top pair production in @xmath8 collisions .",
    "the net contribution to the decay width of four - fermion operators is very small , but the interference produces an asymmetry in the distribution for invariant masses @xmath109 and @xmath110 , which should be studied with more detail .",
    "3 .   operators giving @xmath111 terms will likely be probed with a good precision in like - sign top pair production at lhc , especially for @xmath112 , where the cross sections are potentially large and the final state relatively clean .",
    "we have also given expressions to calculate the fb asymmetry for @xmath31 production at tevatron including all contributing four - fermion operators , to complement present studies  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have provided in this paper a roadmap for future studies of gauge - invariant four - fermion operators in top physics , which we expect will be useful now that the era of precision measurements in the top sector has just begun .",
