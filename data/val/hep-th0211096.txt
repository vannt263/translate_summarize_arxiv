    "in a recent investigation of the rotating quantum vacuum , davies et .",
    "@xcite uncovered a remarkable issue involving the speed - of - light cylinder of flat space - time . a particle detector rotating at the same angular velocity as this vacuum fails to remain inert in unbounded space - time and remains inert when the space - time is bounded by an infinite cylindrical mirror only if the mirror has a radius less than that of the speed - of - light cylinder .",
    "it is only in this case that the concept of a rotating vacuum is unambiguously defined . in the present article ,",
    "we attempt to extend this discussion of rotation to the problem of defining a rigidly rotating quantum thermal distribution .",
    "whereas we might have expected that this distribution would be pathologically only on and outside the speed - of - light cylinder , in fact we find that it is pathological almost everywhere on the unbounded space - time and likewise on the space - time bounded by a cylindrical mirror except when the mirror has a radius less than that of the speed - of - light cylinder .",
    "this problem is closely related to the definition of a hartle - hawking vacuum on kerr space - time . in particular , on the asymptotically flat region of the space - time for a black hole which is rotating arbitrarily slowly ,",
    "the contributions made to the field by the upgoing modes become negligible and when these are discarded the anti - commutator function associated with the hartle - hawking vacuum of  @xcite coincides with the thermal distribution considered here .",
    "we first introduce a cylindrical co - ordinate system @xmath0 rigidly rotating at a fixed angular velocity @xmath1 ; this is related to the usual cylindrical minkowski co - ordinate system @xmath2 by the transformation @xmath3 these co - ordinates are appropriate to the discussion of rigidly rotating observers ( rros ) in flat space - time .",
    "these are analogous to observers co - rotating with the horizon in kerr space - time .",
    "the scalar wave equation is separable in these co - ordinates . indeed",
    "the corresponding positive klein - gordon norm modes , @xmath4 may be obtained from the standard modes of minkowski space - time in cylindrical co - ordinates , @xmath5 by the identification @xmath6 since it is the norms not the frequencies of the rro modes which determine the commutation relations of the associated creation and annihilation operators , the rotating vacuum naively coincides with the conventional vacuum of minkowski space - time .",
    "the thermal distribution at inverse temperature @xmath7 and rigidly rotating at angular velocity @xmath1 will be described by the density operator @xmath8 with the hamiltonian @xmath9 the thermal anti - commutator function @xmath10 associated with this distribution is therefore characterized by the condition  @xcite @xmath11 it can be checked that at least formally this condition is satisfied by the anti - commutator function defined by the mode sum @xmath12\\times\\\\      j_m\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2-k^2}r\\right)j_m\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2-k^2}r'\\right ) .",

    "these modes clearly make divergent contributions to the mode sum  ( [ eq : twopointpathological ] ) except when either @xmath17 or @xmath18 is zero .",
    "the anti - commutator function @xmath10 is thus pathological except when at least one of the two points is on the @xmath19-axis . in  @xcite",
    ", a similar pathology was noted in the mode sum for the anti - commutator function of the hartle - hawking state considered in  @xcite .",

    ", we only treat the case of a field which satisfies dirichlet conditions on this cylinder . introducing a non - dimensional radial variable @xmath21 ,",
    "a complete set of orthonormal solutions to the field equation subject to the boundary conditions is @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denotes the @xmath25 positive zero of @xmath26 .",
    "the normalization factor has been calculated by making use of an identity for the bessel functions  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see page 765 ) .",
    "the modes which have positive norm are precisely those which have positive frequency @xmath27 .",
    "the vacuum state associated with the field when it is expanded in terms of this set of modes has a anti - commutator function which is given by the mode sum @xmath28 .",

    "it is a well known property of the zeros of @xmath26 that @xmath31  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see  15.3 ) and so we see from  ( [ eq : omegadiscrete ] ) that if @xmath32 , no such modes exist . on the other hand ,",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of this first zero is  ( * ? ?",
    "* see page xviii ) @xmath33 from which we see that if @xmath34 , there are modes of this type for all sufficiently large @xmath35 .",
    "it follows that  ( [ eq : thermaltwopoint ] ) is well behaved if and only if the mirror lies within the speed - of - light cylinder .",
    "when the mirror lies inside the speed - of - light cylinder , static observers and rros both make measurements with respect to the vacuum state whose anti - commutator function is given in  ( [ eq : vacuumtwopoint ] ) .",
    "these measurements can be calculated from @xmath36 .",
    "\\label{eq : ddiff}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we can derive from this a set of expressions for the non - zero components of the energy - momentum stress tensor corresponding to the the conformally invariant field , the details of which can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the mode by mode cancellation of the high frequency divergences which afflict both anti - commutator functions in the coincident limit makes these expressions amenable to numerical analysis and the results are shown in figure  [ fig : thermalexpct ] .",
    "they are compared with the planckian forms corresponding to a rigidly rotating thermal distribution at temperature @xmath37 which are @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are given by @xmath41 and are the speed and lorentz factor of an rro at the appropriate space - time point .",
    "we find that they are in close agreement everywhere except , as expected , close to the mirror .",
    "a renormalized expectation value differs from that an rro measures by a term due to polarization of the vacuum by the mirror .",
    "this term can be calculated by making use of the relationship between that feynman propagator and the euclidean green function ; on the euclidean section of the manifold , the analysis becomes essentially identical to that of a uniformly accelerating infinite flat mirror on the euclidean section of the rindler manifold and we can proceed along the lines of  @xcite . we find that the euclidean green function which vanishes on the mirror is @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the second term in the braces is absent in the case of the euclidean green function on the unbounded manifold and so this is the term that remains after renormalization .",
    "now , closing the points and making a transformation to polar variables @xmath46 and @xmath40 defined by @xmath47 we find that we can perform the integral over @xmath40 to obtain @xmath48 a similar thing can be done for the components of the energy - momentum stress tensor and the resulting expressions together with  ( [ eq : phicyl ] ) are amenable to numerical analysis . once again , the details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ fig : renexpct ] .",
    "they are compared with the casimir divergence close to the mirror which can be calculated by an asymptotic analysis following  @xcite .",

    "we have used these to calculate renormalized expectation values in the thermal distribution when @xmath50 and checked that they are well approximated by the general expressions given in  @xcite .",
    "we found that the anti - commutator function associated with the rigidly rotating thermal distribution on unbounded minkowski space - time is pathological almost everywhere .",
    "the pathology is caused by the existence of non - zero modes which have zero energy as measured by the hamiltonian @xmath14 relevant to rros . in  @xcite",
    ", a similar pathology was noted in the anti - commutator function of the hartle - hawking state considered in  @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath14 is the hamiltonian relevant to observers rigidly rotating with the horizon .",
    "the corresponding modes are thus at the critical point of superradiant scattering .",
    "when minkowski space - time is bounded by an infinite cylinder of radius larger than the speed - of - light cylinder we found that the anti - commutator function is once again pathological almost everywhere because of the existence of these modes for all sufficiently high @xmath35 . in a future article we will show that when the kerr black hole is enclosed within a mirror of constant boyer - lindquist radius larger than the minimum radius of the speed - of - light surface , for all sufficiently high @xmath35 there are complex frequency modes whose real parts lie in the regime we associate with superradiance in the absence of the mirror .",
