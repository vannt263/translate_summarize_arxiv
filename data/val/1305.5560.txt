    "quarkonium suppression in a hot colored medium is a longstanding signature of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation .",
    "it is expected that suppression will arise due to two main effects .",
    "the first mechanism proposed was color debye screening @xcite . in the vacuum , a heavy quark - antiquark bound state , such as charmonium or bottomonium , are kept together by the qcd color field .",
    "simulations of qcd on the lattice show that the color fields take the form of a color - flux tube , which gives rise to an approximately linear potential .",
    "since the quarks are massive and move at low velocities , one can use the framework of non - relativistic qcd .",
    "the spectroscopy of charmonia and bottomonia can be obtained this way . in a hot qcd medium",
    ", the expectation is that the additional color charges around the heavy quark - antiquark pair will produce color fields which screen the potential between them .",
    "the debye screening radius depends on the temperature , and this then leads to a suppression of excited quarkonium states according to their average radius .",
    "this picture has been augmented with recent studies which find that there is also a broadening of the quarkonium spectral functions due to the interaction of soft gluons in the qgp medium with the quarkonium state .",
    "the effects of gluo - dissociation and landau damping can be encapsulated in the quark - antiquark potential as an imaginary part , with the real part governing the screening behavior . for a review of this subject ,",
    "see ref .",
    "more recently , attempts to calculate the potential directly in the lattice have been done , including the real and imaginary parts , i.e. screening and landau damping / gluo - dissociation .",
    "these studies motivate the continued study of quarkonia in relativistic heavy ion collisions , since an observation of suppression could then be connected to the properties studied in the lattice . in this way , we could estimate the temperature reached in the medium .",
    "furthermore , a suppression due to hot nuclear matter effects in the bottomonium case would be a clean signature of deconfinement .",
    "( the picture is complicated in the case of charmonium due to the competing effect of recombination , which is negligible for the case of bottomonium due to the small bottom cross section even at lhc energies . ) in this paper , we present a summary of some key results from the cms in the field of quarkonium studies in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : we briefly describe the detector and analysis preliminaries , then we discuss the results from prompt charmonium .",
    "next , we present the results from non - prompt  which originate mainly from b meson decays",
    ". we then discuss bottomonium measurements , followed by a summary of our findings .",
    "a detailed description of the cms detector can be found in ref .",
    "the main detectors used in this analysis are the muon detectors and the silicon tracker . the solenoidal superconducting magnet of 6 m internal diameter provides a @xmath1 t field .",
    "it houses the silicon pixel and silicon strip tracker , as well as electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters .",
    "the tracker can measure charged tracks in the kinematic range @xmath2 2.5 .",
    "muons are detected via drift tubes , cathode strip chambers and resistive plate chambers in the range @xmath2 2.4 .",
    "the granularity of the tracker working in tandem with the strong bending @xmath3 field allow for measuring muon transverse momenta ( ) with resolution in the range @xmath4 for the analyses presented here .",
    "the muons need a minimum total momentum in the range @xmath5  to reach the muon stations .",
    "this places limits on the acceptance of  mesons . for mid - rapidity",
    ", we can measure  in the range @xmath6 , while at forward rapidity , we can measure it down to @xmath7 . for the  mesons ,",
    "the higher mass is transformed to a higher muon momentum in the decay process , allowing us to measure  mesons down to @xmath8 for all rapidity .    to estimate the collision centrality",
    ", we measure the transverse energy ( ) in a hadron calorimeter placed in the forward region ( hf , @xmath9 ) .",
    "we use a glauber model to simulate the   distributions based on fits to the hf  measurements , as described in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in the invariant mass spectrum of dimuons , cms can measure  mesons and estimate the prompt and non - prompt contributions @xcite .",
    "we distinguish these two categories as follows .",
    "the prompt component originates from directly produced  plus those which arise from the secondary decays of charmonium excited states , such as the  and @xmath10 .",
    "these excited state transitions are sufficiently fast that the muons we observe are indistinguishable from primary muons .",
    "the non - prompt component arises mainly from the decay of beauty hadrons , chiefly @xmath3 mesons .",
    "these weak decays are longer lived , with lifetimes of order @xmath11 m ( for @xmath12 ) . by reconstructing the invariant mass , the position of the secondary vertex in the transverse plane @xmath13 , and the pair",
    ", we can do a simultaneous fit of the invariant mass spectrum together with the pseudo - decay length @xmath14 .",
    "this allows us to estimate the contributions of prompt and non - prompt  separately .",
    "we have measured the production of prompt  in both pbpb and @xmath15 collisions at = 2.76 tev . to quantify the modifications observed in going from @xmath15 to pbpb , we scale the yields measured in @xmath15 using the glauber model from ref .",

    "the mechanism responsible for the suppression are the hot nuclear matter effects , screening and gluo - dissociation , discussed previously .",
    "we see no evidence for a contribution from statistical recombination , which is expected to contribute to the  yield at lower .",
    "in contrast , a model from sharma and vitev  @xcite based on cold - nuclear - matter energy loss plus collisional dissociation of  mesons expects less suppression with increasing , in disagreement with the observed level of suppression that remains constant in our measurement region .    we have also measured the nuclear modification factor for the  meson .",

    "the suppression reaches a factor 2.5 ( @xmath27 ) for the top 5% most central events .",
    "when integrated over centrality , there is a hint of increasing suppression with increasing  or @xmath17 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the non - prompt  production is dominated by the decays of @xmath3 mesons .",
    "therefore , suppression of the non - prompt  yield is expected to be a sensitive probe to energy loss of @xmath0-quarks . due to the large mass of the @xmath0 ( @xmath28 ) , the radiative energy loss of @xmath0 quarks is expected to be suppressed , when compared to light parton gluon bremsstrahlung , at forward angles of order @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the angle between the radiated gluon and the direction of the propagating quark",
    ", @xmath31 is the quark mass of the heavy quark , and @xmath32 its energy .",

    "the data are fit in order to extract various parameters of interest , in particular the raw ( not acceptance corrected ) single ratios @xmath34 in both collision systems and the double ratio of these raw single ratios between the pbpb and @xmath15 system @xmath33 .",
    "the raw single ratios cancel uncertainties arising from mechanisms which affect the excited states and the ground state in the same way .",
    "an example of such a mechanism is the uncertainty arising from the parton distribution functions . for  production ,",
    "the dominant production channel is gluon - gluon fusion , hence the gluon pdf is the one that plays the most important role .",
    "since this pdf enters in the same way in the production of the bottomonium final state , namely in the initial state entrance channel , any modifications will affect the ground state and the excited states in the same way , thus they will cancel in the single ratio .",
    "an important experimental effect which does not cancel in the raw single ratio is a difference in the acceptance for excited states compared to the ground state .",
    "this difference in acceptance arises from the fact that the muons chosen for the analysis must satisfy @xmath35 .",
    "since we look for two muons in order to reconstruct the  mesons , and the  threshold is close to half of the  mass , it is appreciably easier for a state at higher mass to have its muon daughters satisfy the  threshold compared to a lower - mass  meson .",
    "this acceptance effect will cancel in the double ratio between pbpb and @xmath15 .",
    "this makes the double ratio a very robust observable for quantifying modifications of the excited states with a very small systematic uncertainty .",

    "the shape of the invariant mass fit to the  states in the @xmath15 collision system is overlaid on the pbpb data . in the single ratio , the ( 1s )",
    "yield is the reference , and in the double ratio the pbpb and pp ratios are then compared . by construction ,",
    "the double ratio for the 1s is 1 , so the 1s peaks in pbpb and @xmath15 have the same height in the figure .",
    "the interesting observation then is to see what happens to the excited states .",
    "if the excited - to - ground state ratio in pbpb was the same as in @xmath15 , the blue dotted line ( @xmath15 shape ) would also match the pbpb data for the excited states .",
    "clearly it does not .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the excited states are modified in pbpb .",
    "furthermore , we surmise that this modification is not arising from nuclear pdfs , because they would affect the excited states in the same way as the ground state .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this is strictly a hot nuclear matter effect by doing this measurement in the ppb collision system .    in the right panel , we illustrate graphically a different scaling . to compare absolute yields for each state between @xmath15 and pbpb",
    ", we again use a glauber model to estimate the nuclear overlap and the number of collisions , . using this information , we scale the measured yields in @xmath15 and compare them directly to the data .",
    "the blue dotted line in the right panel shows this expected @xmath15 yield , which is the denominator in the construction of the nuclear modification factor .",
