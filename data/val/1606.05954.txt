    "cloud radio - access network ( c - ran ) is a promising architecture to meet the demand for higher data rates in next generation wireless networks . in these systems , the base - stations act as relays and are connected via high - speed backhaul links to a cloud network .",
    "encoding and decoding operations happen centrally in the cloud .",
    "the study of fundamental information theoretic limits and optimal coding techniques for such systems is a fertile area of research .    motivated by c - ran , we study a model where the source is connected to @xmath0 relay terminals using orthogonal links with a fixed capacity .",
    "the relays transmit to the destination over a wireless multiple - access channel .",
    "such a setup is known as the diamond - relay network  @xcite .",
    "we study this model in the presence of an eavesdropper who can eavesdrop the orthogonal links from the source to the relays as well as the wireless transmission from the relays .",
    "we require that a message be transmitted reliably to the legitimate receiver , while keeping it confidential from the eavesdropper .",
    "we adopt the information - theoretic notion of confidentiality , widely used in the literature on the wiretap channel  @xcite .",
    "we thus refer to our setup as the _ wiretapped diamond - relay channel_.    while the secrecy capacity of both the scalar gaussian wiretap channel and its multi - antenna extension can be achieved using gaussian codebooks @xcite , the optimal schemes in multiuser channels are considerably more intricate .",
    "very recently , xie and ulukus  @xcite studied the secure degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) for one - hop gaussian multiuser channels such as the multiple - access channel and the interference channel .",
    "it turns out that interference alignment @xcite plays a central role in achieving the optimal secure d.o.f . while coding schemes based on gaussian codebooks can only achieve zero secure d.o.f .",
    ", the schemes presented in  @xcite involve transmitting a combination of information and jamming signals at each transmitter and judiciously precoding them such that the noise symbols align at the legitimate receiver(s ) , yet mask information symbols at the eavesdropper .",
    "this approach has been extended for the case with no eavesdropper s channel state information ( csi ) at the legitimate parties in  @xcite .",
    "we note that a combination of jamming and interference alignment is also required in the confidential mimo broadcast channel with delayed channel state information  @xcite and the compound mimo wiretap channel  @xcite .",
    "the diamond - relay channel that we consider is a two - hop network where the first hop consists of orthogonal links from the source to the relays , while the second hop is a multiple - access channel from the relays to the destination .",
    "such a network is considerably different from one - hop networks as the channel inputs from the relays need not be mutually independent .",
    "the source can transmit common / independent message , common noise , or any combination of those to the relays . in  @xcite , for the diamond - relay channel where an eavesdropper can wiretap",
    "_ only _ the multiple - access portion of the channel , it is shown that transmitting common noise over the source - relay links facilitates more efficient jamming for both the case with full csi and the case with no eavesdropper s csi .",
    "for example , a key constituent scheme proposed in @xcite for the case with no eavesdropper s csi is computation for jamming ( coj ) where the source transmits a function of information and common noise symbols to two relays in order that the common noise symbols introduced to jam information symbols at the eavesdropper can be canceled at the destination through suitable precoding .",
    "when there are more than two relays , this scheme operates in a time - sharing basis in a way that only two source - relay links are utilized in each sub - scheme . in the present paper , the optimal secure d.o.f . of the wiretapped diamond - relay channel",
    "is established for the case with no eavesdropper s csi . in our wiretapped diamond - relay channel ,",
    "the eavesdropper not only observes the relay transmissions through another multiple - access channel , but also observes a certain number of source - relay links .",
    "the legitimate terminals do not know which subset of source - relay links are revealed to the eavesdropper , except for the total number of such links . for achievability , we note that it is not straightforward to extend the proposed schemes in @xcite because their sub - schemes require _ asymmetric _ link d.o.f .",
    "and hence the amount of wiretapped information varies over time according to the unknown location of wiretapped links .",
    "thus , we first develop symmetric version of the proposed schemes in  @xcite and then combine them with a secure network coding ( snc )  @xcite - like scheme to account for non - secure source - relay links .",
    "while the conventional snc has been developed for fully wired networks , we incorporate snc by utilizing the nature of wireless networks in a way that the additional randomness introduced in the source - relay links due to snc is canceled at the destination by beamforming over the wireless multiple - access channel . to that end",
    ", we judiciously choose the generator matrix for snc . from a technical point of view",
    ", the secrecy analysis involves accounting for the observations from the source - relay links as well as the multiple - access wiretap channel and is considerably more involved .",
    "furthermore , the secure d.o.f . is shown to be the same even when the knowledge of the compromised links is available .",
    "indeed our converse is established via this genie - aided approach .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
