    "the recent development of rf - enabled wet technology provides a new solution to continuously power energy - constrained wireless devices ( wds ) over the air @xcite . wireless power in tens to several hundred of microwatts can be effectively transferred to wds within ten meters distance , making self - sustainable network operation truly feasible and efficient for many low - power wireless applications , e.g. , wireless sensor networks and rf identity ( rfid ) systems with a large number of wds .",
    "the application of wet to wireless communications spurs a novel networking structure named wireless powered communication network ( wpcn ) , where the wds transmit information using the energy harvested by means of wet @xcite .",
    "wpcn removes the need of frequent battery replacement / recharging and reduces the probability of energy outage .",
    "the network lifetime can thus be largely extended and the communication performance can also be improved with more sustainable power supply .        as shown in fig .  [",
    "101 ] , we consider a single - cell wpcn where a hybrid access point ( hap ) is responsible for transmitting wireless energy to and receiving wireless information transmission ( wit ) from a set of distributed wds @xcite . in practice , wet and wit are desired to operate in the same frequency band to achieve higher spectrum efficiency and cost effectiveness . in this case ,",
    "time - division - duplexing ( tdd ) circuit structures are applied at both hap and wds to switch between wet and wit modes to avoid the harmful interference from wet to information decoding @xcite . while a major design challenge is transmission scheduling for wet and wit to achieve both efficient communication and energy harvesting .",
    "most of the existing studies in wpcn have assumed the hap to centrally coordinate the wet and wit with the wds .",
    "for instance , @xcite proposes a round - robin based scheduling , where the hap and wds take turns to transmit energy or data .",
    "the duration of each wd s transmission is optimized by the hap according to the global instantaneous channel state information ( csi ) and then sent to all the wds .",
    "@xcite later extends @xcite to the case with a multi - antenna hap that enables more efficient energy beamforming technique for wet and sdma ( spatial duplexing multiple access ) for wit .",
    "a similar round - robin based scheduling method is considered in @xcite , where each energy - harvesting wd can be either active or inactive in a time slot to achieve a balance between communication delay and energy consumption .",
    "in addition , @xcite considers a polling - based method that the hap periodically inquires the wds about their residual energy levels and performs wet whenever some wds are in low battery state .    in practice , the above centralized methods often incur considerable signaling overhead on channel estimation , control , synchronization , etc",
    ". this could be costly in networks with a large number of wds ( e.g. , sensors ) that are randomly deployed and switch on / off over time for energy saving . in this case ,",
    "distributed scheduling of wet and wit is of high practical interests .",
    "although distributed wireless charging control and data transmissions have been well investigated separately ( e.g. , @xcite ) , there are only few studies integrating them in the design of wpcn .",
    "for instance , @xcite proposes an energy - adaptive csma - type mac ( medium access control ) method , where the access probability of a wd decreases with its energy harvesting rate .",
    "however , it assumes that wet is independent of wit , and thus no joint wet and wit scheduling is considered .",
    "@xcite proposes a rf - mac scheme that multiple haps are divided into groups to perform wet in respond to wds energy request , and the wds use csma - type random access control to coordinate the data exchange among each other .",
    "the rf - mac method , however , requires the wds to bear complicated computation and channel estimation tasks .",
    "further , @xcite considers a simplified version of rf - mac , where the throughput performance of a wpcn using a single hap is evaluated via simulations .",
    "nonetheless , the analysis of both works is limited and does not capture the important coupling between energy and information transmissions .    in this paper",
    ", we present a practical distributed scheduling protocol for wpcn .",
    "similar to the idea of rf - mac , we allow each wd that is about to deplete its battery to broadcast an energy request buzz ( erb ) signal in order to trigger the wet by the hap to recharge its battery .",
    "if no erb is sent , the wds then contend to transmit data to the hap based on the conventional @xmath0-persistent csma .- persistent csma achieves similar performance as the exponential backoff scheme in @xcite when the transmit probability @xmath1 of the wds is proportional to the user number @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the hap is aware of the number of associating wds and thus can calculate @xmath1 and broadcast its value to the wds . ] in particular , we propose an energy queueing model to analyze the throughput performance of the proposed distributed scheduling protocol .",
    "simulation results are provided to verify our analysis and show that the proposed method can achieve good throughput performance as compared to a benchmark @xmath0-persistent csma network assuming always sufficient energy supply .",
    "in addition , an interesting _ energy decoupling _",
    "property is revealed , which is useful in deriving the throughput and understanding the insight on designing distributed scheduling in wpcn .",
    "as shown in fig .  1 , we consider a wpcn consisting of a hap and @xmath2 wds , where all the devices each have one single antenna .",
    "we assume that wet and wit are performed over the same frequency band , such that each wd s antenna is used for both energy harvesting and communication in a tdd manner ( see wd1 in fig .",
    "[ 101 ] ) . the energy harvesting circuit converts the received rf signal to dc energy and stores in a rechargeable battery . the energy is then used to power the wit .",
    "the hap also has a similar tdd circuit structure ( see fig .",
    "[ 101 ] ) to switch between energy transfer and communications with the wds .",
    "we assume that all the @xmath2 wds are continuously backlogged , i.e. , they always have packets to transmit .",
    "besides , the network is fully connected , such that the transmission of one device ( wd or hap ) can be overheard by all the other devices . meanwhile , all devices are assumed to have carrier sensing capability , such that they remain silent when sensing any ongoing energy / information transmission and attempt to transmit only after the channel becomes idle .",
    "the proposed distributed scheduling mechanism is illustrated in fig .",
    "@xmath3 and explained as follows .          in the proposed distributed scheduling mechanism ,",
    "each wd continuously monitors its residual battery level .",
    "if it is above a predetermined threshold , the wd waits for the channel to be continuously idle for a difs ( distributed inter - frame spacing ) time and then transmits independently a payload packet with probability @xmath4 to the hap .",
    "the duration of difs is much larger than the signal round - time - delay ( rtd ) of the network , such that a wd s data transmission will not interfere with the potential data transmissions of the other wds due to signal prorogation delay .",
    "the packet header contains the identity of the transmitting wd , such that the hap can identify the sender if the packet is successfully decoded .",
    "otherwise , if a wd finds its residual battery level below the threshold , it waits the channel to be continuously idle for a pifs ( priority inter - frame spacing ) time and then sends a short energy request buzz ( erb ) signal .",
    "the duration of the pifs is smaller than that of difs ( but still much larger than the rtd ) , such that a higher priority is assigned to sending an erb than a data payload .    from the hap s perspective",
    ", it can identify the current time slot as a wet slot when sensing any erb sent , either by one or multiple wds , and respond by performing wet for @xmath5 amount of time .",
    "meanwhile , all the wds sensing the erb signal switch to energy harvesting mode .",
    "otherwise , if no erb signal is sensed , the hap identifies the current time slot as a wit slot and switches to information receiving mode . due to the close communication range ( say , within @xmath6 meters ) typically for wpcn",
    ", we assume the receiver signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is sufficiently high and thus neglect the decoding errors caused by channel fading and receiver noise during data transmissions .",
    "accordingly , a wit slot may correspond to one of the following three scenarios :    1 .",
    "success : if only one wd transmits data , the transmitted packet can be successfully decoded by the hap , which then responds to the transmitting wd by sending an ack message ( containing the i d of the transmitter ) after sensing the channel to be idle for sifs ( short inter - frame spacing ) time .",
    "notice that sifs is shorter than the difs and pifs such that no wd will transmit before the hap sends the ack ; 2 .   collision : if more than one wds transmit data in the same time slot , the multiple packets will collide and none of then can be correctly decoded by the hap . in this case , the hap broadcasts a nak message after sensing the channel to be idle for sifs . by doing so",
    ", the transmitting wds can identify collision and schedule data retransmission ; 3 .",
    "idle : otherwise , no wd transmits data and all wds keep silent for a mini slot of duration @xmath7 .",
    "notice that the wds do not need to wait for another difs time to transmit data after an idle time slot .",
    "instead , they can persistently access the channel with probability @xmath1 in the following mini slots until some wd transmits . therefore , we may observe consecutive idle mini slots .    after the current time slot , either for wet or wit ,",
    "all the devices continue to sense the wireless medium , and the above iteration repeats itself .",
    "we use an example to illustrate the operation of the proposed protocol in fig .",
    "3 . initially ,",
    "the @xmath3 wds have sufficient energy to transmit and wd1 transmits successfully .",
    "after the channel becomes idle for difs , no wd transmits in two consecutive idle time slots each of duration @xmath7 , until they both transmit data in the third attempt and cause a collision .",
    "then , after transmitting data , wd@xmath8 is lack of energy and sends an erb signal after a pifs . upon detecting the erb signal ,",
    "the hap starts wet for the wds to harvest energy .      for a wet time slot ,",
    "we assume channel fading effect is averaged out over the duration of energy transmission such that the received energy by the @xmath9-th wd is only related to its distance @xmath10 to the hap . due to the broadcasting nature of wireless channels , all the @xmath2 wds can harvest energy in a wet time slot .",
    "we also assume that the wds can not harvest energy from wit , as transmit power of wd is significantly lower than that of wet by the hap , e.g. , @xmath6mw versus @xmath11w .",
    "thus , the received energy by the @xmath9-th wd in a wet slot is @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the energy harvesting efficiency , @xmath14 denotes the antenna gain , @xmath15 denotes the power of wet , @xmath16 denotes the carrier frequency and @xmath17 denotes the path loss exponent , which is assumed equal for all the wds .    for a wit slot",
    ", we assume that all the wds transmit with constant power @xmath18 .",
    "for the simplicity of analysis , we assume that each wd transmits a payload of fixed duration @xmath19 in a wit slot , such that it consumes @xmath20 amount of energy regardless of that the transmission is successful or results in a collision .",
    "nonetheless , our analysis can also be extended to the case that the payload lengths are different in a success and a collision slot , such as a cts / rts - like scheme in 802.11 wlan @xcite . with channel error neglected , the decoding failure is only caused by transmit collisions .",
    "-node example of the distributed scheduling protocol operation.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      in this paper , we consider a discrete energy model and assume that the transmission of each fixed - length payload consumes @xmath8 unit of energy and the battery capacity of each wd is @xmath21 units , where @xmath22 is a positive integer .",
    "besides , we assume that the @xmath9-th wd harvests fixed @xmath23 units of energy in each wet slot . here , @xmath24 is a positive integer , @xmath25 , depending on the distance between the wd and the hap .",
    "this may correspond to a practical design requirement that @xmath26 , @xmath27 , to avoid frequent energy transmissions , which is achievable through either setting a long enough @xmath5 or preventing ineffective far - away wds from associating with the hap .",
    "we denote @xmath28 as the battery level ( in units ) of the @xmath9-th wd at the end of the @xmath29-th time slot , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 as the number of units of energy harvested and consumed during the @xmath29-th time slot , respectively .",
    "then , the battery dynamics of the @xmath9-th wd can be expressed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denotes the initial energy level .",
    "depending on the type of the @xmath29-th transmission slot , @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be categorized as follows :    1 .",
    "wet slot : @xmath37 and @xmath38 for all the wds ; ; 2 .",
    "success / collision wit slot : @xmath39 and @xmath40 for transmitting wds , and @xmath41 otherwise ; 3 .",
    "idle wit slot : @xmath41 for all the wds .    without loss of generality , we assume that a wd sends erb signal when @xmath42 .      in this paper ,",
    "a key performance metric is the normalized network throughput , defined as the percentage of air time occupied by successful data transmissions expressed as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the probabilities of a successful packet transmission slot , a packet collision slot , an idle slot , and an energy transfer slot , respectively . by assuming the durations of ack and nak are equal",
    ", we can see from fig .  3 that @xmath46 in the next section , we analyze the throughput performance of the distributed energy and information scheduling algorithm .",
    "we start with modeling the battery dynamic of each wd as a b - d queueing process . as shown in fig .  4",
    ", we drop the superscript @xmath29 for simplicity of expression and use @xmath47 to denote the residual energy of the @xmath9-th wd at the beginning of a time slot .",
    "we refer to the wd as in the @xmath48-th energy state if @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , we use @xmath51 to denote the probability of the @xmath9-th wd in the @xmath48-th energy state observing a wet slot , @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , we can express the state transition probability @xmath53 , which denotes the probability that the @xmath9-th wd changes from the @xmath48-th to the @xmath54-th energy state , as follows :    [ 7 ] @xmath55    for intermediate states with @xmath56 .",
    "besides , the other two boundary states @xmath57 and @xmath21 satisfy    [ 8 ] @xmath58    here , ( [ 4])-([5 ] ) correspond to a wet slot , a success / collision wit slot , and an idle slot , respectively .",
    "in addition , ( [ 2 ] ) holds because a wd with @xmath59 will immediately send erb and receive energy in the current time slot .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) hold because the energy of a fully - charged wd will reduce only when it transmits data , and remain unchanged otherwise .",
    "-th wd ( @xmath60).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it is evident that the occurrence of an energy transfer slot is related to the energy states of all the wds , where a wet slot occurs when @xmath61 for some wd @xmath9 .",
    "accordingly , precise system - level analysis requires a high - dimensional markov system that jointly considers the energy states of all the wds .",
    "this , however , renders the problem analytically intractable due to the large number of inter - connected states . for tractable analysis",
    ", we make in this paper the following _ energy decoupling assumption_.    * energy decoupling assumption ( eda ) : * _ in the considered energy queueing system ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) , the limiting probabilities of the @xmath2 wds are independent and each wd @xmath9 observes a constant probability of wet in a time slot independent of its current energy state , i.e. , @xmath62 , @xmath52 . _",
    "* remark 1 * : the eda assumption considered in this paper is analogous to the well - known _ mean - field decoupling assumption _ made in the seminal work on performance analysis of 802.11 dcf medium access control @xcite , where wds with unlimited energy supply transmit data following a random backoff mechanism .",
    "specifically , it assumes that when the number of wds in a 802.11 network is large enough , each wd observes a constant collision probability upon transmission , which is independent of ( but in fact related to ) the current backoff stages of itself and the other wds .    as an initial attempt to investigate the performance of distributed scheduling of wet and wit in wpcn",
    ", we leave the proof of the above eda assumption in our future work . for the time being , the eda is verified using simulations later in section v , where we show that this assumption approximately holds when the number of wds is not too small , e.g. , @xmath63 .      with the eda assumption",
    ", we can replace @xmath51 s with @xmath64 in ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "we denote the steady - state limiting probabilities of the @xmath9-th wd as @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "for such a birth - death ( b - d ) queueing process in fig .  4",
    ", its limiting probabilities satisfy the following equalities by establishing ",

    "notice that the value of @xmath75 is determined by @xmath64 and @xmath23 for the @xmath9-th wd .",

    "for instance , when @xmath60 and @xmath84 , @xmath83 can be expressed as @xmath85 besides , we show in the appendix that @xmath86 is a decreasing function for @xmath87 .",
    "notice that each wd @xmath9 with @xmath88 observes an ongoing erb signal when at least one of the other @xmath89 wds is in the @xmath57-th energy state .",

    "for instance , when the wds are homogeneous , i.e. , @xmath23 s are equal for all the wds , we can denote by symmetry that @xmath100 and @xmath101 , @xmath27 . in this case , as @xmath102 is a non - decreasing function , @xmath103 can be obtained using simple bi - section search over @xmath104 until @xmath105 is satisfied within a given precision level . in general , @xmath106 s can be obtained numerically , e.g. , using the quasi - newton method .",
    "given @xmath93 , we are ready to derive the throughput performance .",
    "specifically , the probability of a wet slot is @xmath107 i.e. , at least one of the wds sends erb .",
    "accordingly , the probability of an information transmission slot is @xmath108 .",
    "then , the probability of a successful transmission is @xmath109 i.e. , exactly one wd transmits information . besides , the probabilities of an idle slot and a collision slot are respectively @xmath110 by substituting ( [ 21])-([23 ] ) into ( [ 1 ] ) , we can obtain the throughput @xmath111 .",
    "we notice that each wd has the equal probability to transmit information in a wit slot .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2 wds have the same average data rate @xmath112 . from ( [ 21 ] ) , if some wd @xmath9 has very high probability of energy outage , i.e. , large @xmath113 , the data rates of all the wds can be very low .",
    "therefore , our proposed method should be applied to a network with limited wet range , e.g. , the maximum wd - to - hap distance is less than @xmath6 meters to ensure that all wds can be effectively charged by the hap .",

    "<S> specifically , we allow a wd that is about to deplete its battery to broadcast an energy request buzz ( erb ) , which triggers wet from its associated hybrid access point ( hap ) to recharge the battery . </S>",
    "<S> if no erb is sent , the wds contend to transmit data to the hap using the conventional @xmath0-persistent csma ( carrier sensing multiple access ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we propose an energy queueing model based on an energy decoupling property to derive the throughput performance . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is verified through simulations under practical network parameters , which demonstrate good throughput performance of the distributed scheduling protocol and reveal some interesting design insights that are different from conventional contention - based communication network assuming the wds are powered with unlimited energy supplies . </S>"
