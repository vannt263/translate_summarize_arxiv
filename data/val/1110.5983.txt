    "formulation of discretized supersymmetric yang  mills ( sym ) theories in a way ensuring compatibility with the lattice is an old problem in lattice field theory .",
    "recent developments based on the ideas taken from topological field theories and also orbifold / deconstruction techniques have created promising pathways into the solution of this long standing problem . in this review",
    "we focus on a class of lattice gauge theories constructed from _ topologically twisting",
    "_ the continuum sym theories .",
    "the twisted sym theories on the lattice turn out to be local , doublers free , and exact gauge - invariant theories , which are invariant under one or more supersymmetries .",
    "these theories , in principle , are qualified enough to form the basis for a truly non - perturbative definition of the continuum sym theories .    to make this review as self - contained as possible , we have included a set of introductory topics , such as the construction of sym theories in various dimensions , general properties of topological field theories , and their connections to sym theories and lattice formulations , and the geometric structure of the resultant lattices .",
    "we introduce the four - dimensional @xmath0 sym theory in section 2 . to maintain the symmetry between the number of fermion and boson degrees of freedom in a given yang  mills theory coupled to spin-1/2 fermions in arbitrary dimensions ,",
    "various conditions can be imposed on dirac fermions in various dimensions .",
    "these conditions lead to weyl , majorana , and weyl  majorana fermions .",
    "the method of dimensional reduction is then applied to the ten - dimensional @xmath1 sym theory to obtain the @xmath0 sym theory in four dimensions .    in section 3 , we introduce topological field theories , brst invariance in gauge theories , and then discuss topological field theories of witten type , which are the focus of our interest .    we show how to twist the supersymmetries of sym theories with extended supersymmetries in section 4 .",
    "the method of maximal twisting is discussed , and then its relevance to the lattice constructions is explained .",
    "we give the twisted versions of the two - dimensional @xmath2 and four - dimensional @xmath0 sym theories , exposing the nilpotent scalar supersymmetries appearing as a consequence of the twist .",
    "we also write down the action and scalar supersymmetries of these theories .",
    "in section 5 , we introduce supersymmetric lattices , their geometric structure , orientation of the field operators , covariant derivatives on the lattice , connection to dirac  khler fermions , and discretized supersymmetries and actions of the twisted sym theories .    after these introductory sections , in section 6 , we review the @xmath0 sym at one - loop on a four - dimensional lattice .",
    "the lattice formulation of the @xmath0 sym retains one exact supersymmetry at non - zero lattice spacing .",
    "this feature , combined with gauge - invariance and the large point group symmetry of the lattice theory , can be used to show that the only counterterms that appear at any order in perturbation theory correspond to the renormalizations of existing terms in the bare lattice action .",
    "also it can be shown that mass terms are not generated at any finite order of perturbation theory .",
    "the one - loop renormalization coefficients of the theory exhibit a common logarithmic divergence that can be absorbed by a single wavefunction renormalization .",
    "this implies that for the lattice @xmath0 theory , at one - loop , only a fine tuning of the finite parts is required to regain full supersymmetry in the continuum limit .    in section 7",
    ", we review some of the applications of the lattice constructions of twisted sym theories in the context of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "we discuss recent results obtained from lattice simulations of the sym quantum mechanics and the two - dimensional sym theory at finite temperature .",
    "both the gauge theories appear in the generalizations of the holographic duality conjecture .",
    "the dual gravitational theory of sym quantum mechanics contains black holes . as the temperature changes ,",
    "there is a transition between black holes ( described by a confined phase in the gauge theory ) and a gas of hot strings ( described by a deconfined phase in the gauge theory ) in the dual gravitational theory .",

    "the d1-branes have charge and mass , and they describe certain black hole geometry . in the dual gravitational theory , at large @xmath3 and strong coupling , it has been proposed that , there is a phase transition related to the gregory  laflamme phase transition connecting a localized black hole solution and a uniform black hole solution wrapping around the compactified direction .",
    "the study of the time and space polyakov loops in the two - dimensional gauge theory may show evidence supporting this transition .",
    "this gauge theory is analyzed on the lattice using twisted construction , and indeed the behavior the time and space polyakov loops strongly suggests such a transition .",
    "in particular , at strong coupling , the transition has the parametric dependence on coupling predicted by the gravitational theory .",
    "the temperature corresponding to the gregory  laflamme phase transition can be estimated from the lattice study of the gauge theory which , interestingly , is not yet known directly in the gravitational dual .",

    "theories form an interesting class of quantum field theories . among them , the four - dimensional sym theory with sixteen supersymmetries is a very special quantum field theory in its own right .",
    "this theory exhibits many interesting properties . for zero theta angle ,",
    "the four - dimensional sym theory with a simple gauge group has just a single dimensionless coupling parameter , the gauge coupling parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the classical version of this theory exhibits superconformal invariance , owing to the dimensionless nature of its coupling parameter .",
    "its beta function vanishes identically to all orders in perturbation theory and the same is believed to be true at the nonperturbative level .",
    "this theory , therefore , is finite , with no renormalization at all .",
    "its coupling parameter does not run , unlike most gauge theories , different values of @xmath5 really give different theories , rather than being transmuted to a change of scale .",
    "another interesting property exhibited by this theory is exact electric - magnetic duality , that is , the invariance under the interchange of electric and magnetic quantum numbers .",
    "the theory is also invariant under the replacement of @xmath5 with @xmath6 , that is , the theory with a weak gauge coupling @xmath5 is fully equivalent to the one with a strong gauge coupling @xmath6 .    in 1997 , maldacena proposed@xcite a new duality relating type ii supergravity ( a certain low energy limit of string theory ) in @xmath7-dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) space and @xmath8-dimensional super conformal theories .",
    "this is known as the holographic principle .",
    "the @xmath0 sym theory takes part in the most successful realization of holographic principle .",
    "this theory can be realized as the gauge theory living on a d3-brane of type iib superstring theory in @xmath9 space .",
    "the action of @xmath0 sym theory was given for the first time in 1977 in refs . and within the framework of string theory toroidal compactifications .",
    "this theory has the maximal amount of supersymmetry , sixteen real supercharges , for a four - dimensional field theory with global supersymmetry .",
    "there exist different types of construction schemes for four - dimensional @xmath0 sym theory .",

    "these two numbers do not match in any dimension . in order to demand the additional symmetry",
    ", we will have to reduce the number of fermionic degrees of freedom by requiring the spinor to satisfy some supplementary conditions .",
    "let us consider a yang ",
    "mills theory coupled to massless spin-@xmath10 particles on a @xmath8-dimensional flat minkowski space @xmath14 with signature @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "the metric is ds^2 = _ m , n g_mn dx^m dx^n = -(dx^0)^2 + ( dx^1)^2 + + ( dx^(d-1))^2  .",
    "the theory has a gauge field @xmath17 taking values in the real lie algebra of a compact gauge group @xmath18 .",
    "the gauge field takes values in anti - hermitian matrices , in the adjoint representation of @xmath18 .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath19 is d_m = _ m + a_m  , the corresponding curvature @xmath20 is f_mn = [ d_m , d_n ] = _ m a_n - _",
    "n a_m + [ a_m , a_n ]  .",
    "we add a fermionic term to the @xmath8-dimensional yang  mills action .",
    "the fermions are contained in a dirac spinor @xmath21 taking values in the lie algebra of @xmath18 .",
    "the action is [ eq : ym - dirac - action - d ] s = trd^d x ( - f_mn f^mn + i ^md_m )  , where @xmath22 are the @xmath8-dimensional gamma matrices . since anti - hermitian matrices generate the lie algebra in our case , the trace @xmath23is negative definite .    we examine the dimensions in which the action ( [ eq : ym - dirac - action - d ] ) permits the extra symmetry - supersymmetry - between the gauge bosons and the fermions without the addition of other fields .",
    "the requirement of same number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom is essential for field theories that transform as linear representations of supersymmetry .",
    "since the spinor degrees of freedom grow faster than that of gauge bosons , we will reduce the number of spinor degrees of freedom by imposing some additional conditions on the fermions .",
    "before we choose those conditions , a familiarization with spinor representations in arbitrary dimensions would be useful .",
    "the lorentz group , the symmetry group of minkowski space , admits finite - dimensional representations .",
    "spinors appear as fields that transform under finite - dimensional representations of the lorentz group .",
    "we use the language of clifford algebras to discuss the spinor representations in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "a clifford algebra is a set of matrices ( we call them gamma matrices ) satisfying the anticommutation relations : \\ { _ m , _ n } = 2 g_mn  , where @xmath24 .",
    "given such a set of matrices , we see that the following antisymmetric matrices , ^mn = -[^m , ^n ] = -^nm  , satisfy the commutation relations of the lorentz group generators : i[^mn , ^sr ] = ^ns^mr + ^mr^ns - ^nr^ms - ^ms^nr  . the matrices @xmath25 give a @xmath8-dimensional representation of the lorentz algebra .",
    "they are a set of antisymmetric tensors transforming according to the @xmath8-dimensional lorentz vector representation of @xmath26 .",
    "they act on the space of fields called dirac spinors . the algebra generated by @xmath25 yield the spinor representation of @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath8-dimensional representation of the lorentz algebra generated by @xmath25 is not always an irreducible representation . to see",
    "if a given representation is reducible or not , we need to consider separately the case where @xmath8 is an odd or even dimension .",
    "we begin with the construction of gamma matrices in even dimensions , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "we group the gamma matrices into a set of raising and lowering operators@xcite u^_0 & = & ( _ 0 + _ 1 )  , + u^_a & = & ( _ 2a i _",
    "2a+1 )  , where @xmath29 .",
    "these operators satisfy the following anticommutation relations : \\ { u_i^+ , u_j^- } & = & _ ij  , i , j=0 , 1 , , k + \\",
    "{ u_i^+ , u_j^+ } & = & \\ { u_i^- , u_j^- } = 0  , along with the conditions : ( u_i^+)^2 & = & ( u_i^-)^2 = 0  .",
    "we can let @xmath30 operators act repeatedly on any spinor state to reach a spinor @xmath31 annihilated by all @xmath30 s u_i^-     )  .",
    "we have @xmath32 and , as before , we define @xmath33 . thus the lattice propagators are d^a ( * k * ) d^b(- * k * ) & = & 0  , + d^a ( * k * ) b^b_a(- * k * ) & = & i_ab  , + b^a_a ( * k * ) b^b_b(- * k * ) & = & _ ab_ab  . from ( [ offshella ] ) the propagator for the @xmath34 field is also a^a_a ( * k * ) a^b_b(- * k * ) = _",
    "the @xmath8 field is non - propagating at tree level as it should be since it is an auxiliary field .",
    "on using these propagators and those derived earlier for the bosons and fermions , we can now write down the generic feynman diagram contributing to a renormalization of the auxiliary boson propagator . it is shown in figure  [ bbubble ] and represents the set of amputated diagrams possessing two external @xmath35 field legs .",
    "these combine with the external @xmath36 propagators derived above to yield the renormalized propagator for the auxiliary field .",
    "the vanishing of the tree level @xmath37 propagators ensures that no amputated diagrams with 2 @xmath8 field external legs contribute .",
    "the set of all such lattice feynman diagrams is shown below and corresponds to a subset of the @xmath35 field vacuum polarization diagrams .",
    "it is important to notice that almost all these diagrams appear in the continuum off - shell twisted theory .",
    "the exceptions are just the diagrams containing a @xmath38 vertex that corresponds to the lattice vertex v_dbb = d^a(- * k * - * q * ) b^b_a ( * k * ) b^c_b ( * q * ) = _ ab(_abc+_abc)(1-e^-i(k_a+q_a ) )  .",
    "these diagrams do not contribute to the divergent piece in the @xmath37 propagator at this order of perturbation theory since the above vertex vanishes as the lattice spacing is sent to zero .",
    "hence , we are left with a set of diagrams that correspond to those of the equivalent continuum theory at one - loop order .",
    "this fact can be exploited to argue that the leading logarithmic divergences of the lattice theory are shared with the continuum theory .      at this stage ,",
    "the expressions we have in hand , the amputated one - loop diagrams that determine the renormalization of three fermion propagators and the set of feynman graphs needed to renormalize the auxiliary bosonic field propagator would in principle , allow us to determine all four coefficients @xmath39 appearing in the renormalized action ( [ eq : general - form ] ) .",
    "the question of how much fine tuning of the lattice theory is required to regain full supersymmetry would be determined by the parts of those expressions that diverge as the lattice spacing is sent to zero .",
    "so it is necessary to evaluate those expressions for the one - loop integrals as the lattice spacing goes to zero .",
    "we first focus on the diagrams contributing to the fermion propagators .",
    "the one - loop fermion propagators all vanish as the external momentum goes to zero , which is consistent with the earlier effective action computation showing that no fermionic mass terms can be generated perturbatively . but",
    "coming to the amputated one - loop diagrams , there is a difficulty , due to the power counting theorem of reisz@xcite : we can not simply take the naive continuum limit of the expressions for the the amputated one - loop diagrams as they have a naive degree of divergence of 1 .",
    "it turns out that a trick due to ref . and",
    "detailed in ref . can be used to extract the leading divergences from those diagrams without disrespecting reisz s theorem .",
    "the trick is to split the integral @xmath40 into two pieces : _ a 0 i()&= & _ a 0 + & &  + _ a 0  .",
    "now the first term in square brackets can be evaluated in the naive continuum limit and contains no divergence .",
    "the divergence is in the second term but since there is no external momenta in the integrand , its evaluation on the lattice becomes simple .",
    "not that , @xmath41 vanishes for each of the diagrams so the calculation becomes even more simple .",
    "next step obviously would be the numerical evaluation of the integral for a variety of regulator masses @xmath42 and extract the logarithmic divergence and any constant contributions using a fitting procedure .",
    "it turns out that , we could use a simpler approach if we are only interested in the leading log divergences , in which a naive continuum limit can be taken and the expressions evaluated using the dimensional regularization .    as a result of such procedure ,",
    "we obtain the following expressions for the fermion self - energy diagrams : i__d ( ) & ~ & - p_d f_abcf_bcd a  , + i__a _ de ( ) & ~ & f_abc f_bcd(_dap_e-_eap_d ) + i__ab _ gh ( ) & ~ & - f_abc f_bcd _ d _ abdgh p_d a  . the cutoff @xmath43 has been inserted inside the logarithm to ensure that it is dimensionless .    the amputated divergent diagrams for the lattice @xmath8 propagator are also log divergent .",
    "it is possible to extract the sum of these logarithmic divergences using the same tricks used for the fermions , evaluating the diagram in the naive continuum limit .",
    "the sum of all these diagrams , contracted with external @xmath44 propagators , will then yield a log divergent term of the form c_dd = cf_acbf_dcb  , where @xmath45 is a constant to be determined by explicitly evaluating the diagrams .",
    "however , it is not necessary to evaluate these diagrams , even in the continuum , to determine @xmath46  the requirement that the continuum theory preserve full supersymmetry will automatically determine @xmath46 in terms of the other @xmath39 corresponding to the fermion propagator renormalization .",
    "upon combining the divergent parts of the individual amputated diagrams computed above we can compute the leading logarithmic divergences appearing in the renormalized propagators .",
    "several of the amputated fermion diagrams may appear as internal bubbles when correcting a given fermion propagator .",
    "for example , in the @xmath47 diagram shown in figure [ fig : full_p ] , naively three of the amputated diagrams contribute to the renormalization of this propagator .",
    "however , the underlying lorentz structure of the propagators and integrals ( at least in the case of the @xmath48 divergences ) restricts the contributions from some of the diagrams . as a result",
    ", only the @xmath49 amputated diagram contributes to the renormalization of the @xmath49 propagator .",
    "the renormalization of the @xmath49 propagator , denoting the full diagrams by @xmath50 , is given by c__d & ~ & f_abcf_bcd a  .",
    "for the case of other diagrams , it can be shown that only @xmath51 contributes to @xmath52 and @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "c__a _ de & ~ & f_abcf_bcd  a  .",
    "noting that the internal propagator in @xmath53 can be a @xmath55 or @xmath56 , the full diagram @xmath54 comes with a factor of 2 .",
    "c__ab _ de & ~ & f_abc f_bcda _ k _ abkde  .",
    "the coefficients of the propagators in the renormalized propagator amplitudes @xmath50 now determine the coefficients @xmath39 .",
    "explicitly , they take the form _",
    "i = 1 + b_i i = 1 , 2 , 4  , where b_i = b =  , and the property @xmath57 is used for the case of @xmath4 .",
    "this restriction is needed as the color structure of any counterterms must match that of the tree propagators . for the case of @xmath58",
    "it becomes @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath60 trace part can be ignored in the continuum as it simply decouples from the rest of the system . on the lattice , especially when performing simulations , a similar result can be achieved by giving the @xmath60 mode a large mass of the order of the cut - off that will serve to decouple it from the @xmath4 modes at finite lattice spacing .",
    "this will result in breaking of supersymmetry in this sector but it may be removed by sending the @xmath60 mass to zero _ after _ taking the continuum limit .",
    "naive expectations would lead us to conclude that the coefficients @xmath61 are all different .",
    "however , the above results indicate that , in fact , the log divergent parts of @xmath61 and , hence , @xmath39 are actually all equal .",
    "the reasoning is , to untwist the continuum theory into a theory with four majorana spinors requires that the continuum twisted fermions exhibit a common wavefunction renormalization .",
    "this just follows from the fact that the individual components of the spinors mix the different twisted fermions together . to achieve this requires that the corresponding renormalization constants of the kinetic terms @xmath39 should all be equal  agreeing with the findings above",
    "furthermore , since the leading log behavior of the lattice theory is the same as the continuum , one should expect that the log divergent part of the lattice couplings behave in the same way .",
    "thus , a single wavefunction renormalization of the twisted lattice fermions is all that is needed to render the renormalized theory finite .",
    "the common anomalous dimension of the fermions in this twisted scheme is then given by = .",
    "the leading log divergent contribution to the @xmath62 propagator can be computed from the naive continuum limit of the corresponding continuum expression for the sum of the @xmath63 bubble diagrams given in diagram  [ allbbubbles ] .",
    "combined with the fact that the tree level @xmath64 propagators required on the outside of these @xmath63 amputated diagrams are the same as the continuum to @xmath65 , the log divergence in the mass renormalization of the @xmath8 field must be the same on the lattice as in the continuum .",
    "using this fact it can be argued that the log divergent part of @xmath46 must actually be equal to that of the fermions , @xmath66 , for example .",
    "this follows from the fact that the bosonic action for general @xmath39 can be rewritten as _ 1 ( _ ab f_ab ) + ( [ _ a , d_a]^2 )  .",
    "this renormalized bosonic action can be untwisted to yield the conventional gauge field plus scalar action in the continuum limit only for @xmath67 .",
    "this condition must be true since the continuum twisted theory exhibits full supersymmetry .",
    "then the general arguments on renormalization described earlier indicate that the log divergence of @xmath46 on the lattice must satisfy the same property .    to conclude , the log divergent parts of the coefficients @xmath68 must all be equal to one - loop order in the lattice theory .",
    "this implies that a common wavefunction renormalization of both twisted fermions and bosons is sufficient to render the renormalized theory finite at one - loop with all fields acquiring an anomalous dimension ( in this scheme ) given by @xmath69 .",
    "physically , the equality of the couplings @xmath68 means that _ no _ logarithmic fine tuning is required at weak coupling for the lattice theory to exhibit full supersymmetry as the lattice spacing is sent to zero .",
    "the duality conjecture between gauge theories and string theories@xcite provides a very promising new direction for investigating the properties of gravitational theories .",
    "this conjecture may be used to describe certain black holes in terms of the world volume theories of the d - branes that compose them .",
    "the type ii string theory reduces to a supergravity theory for low energies compared to the string scale @xmath70 . in this limit",
    "the gravitational theory contains black holes with finite temperature and @xmath3 units of d - brane charge .",
    "then one can use the correspondence to describe these black holes in terms of the worldvolume theories of the d - branes , which are supersymmetric yang ",
    "mills theories with sixteen supercharges in various dimensions , taken in the large @xmath3 ",
    "t hooft limit and at finite temperature .",
    "the string theory black holes are described by the strongly coupled sectors of these gauge theories . solving the gauge theories would allow one to directly study the quantum properties of the dual black holes , including their thermodynamic properties .",
    "since the gauge theories are strongly coupled , their direct computation needs nonperturbative techniques such as lattice simulations .    according to the ads / cft conjecture , type ii superstring theory in @xmath71 space , where @xmath72 is a compact manifold with positive curvature ,",
    "should be equivalent to a superconformal field theory living on the @xmath8-dimensional boundary of @xmath73 . among the many generalizations of this conjecture we look closely at the two cases - those involving d0-branes and d1-branes - to apply the twisted field theory formulations to derive some interesting results .",
    "the duality conjecture consists of a mapping between type ii string theory containing @xmath3 dp - branes and ( p + 1)-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with gauge group @xmath4 .",
    "perhaps the simplest of these systems would be the one which describes the dynamics of d0-branes in type iia string theory in terms of sixteen supercharge yang ",

    "we consider a system of @xmath3 coincident d0-branes in the  decoupling limit \" with @xmath3 large and @xmath74 fixed , where @xmath75 is the string coupling .",
    "the decoupling limit is taken by considering excitations of the collection of d0-branes with fixed energy while sending the string length scale @xmath76 to zero .",
