    "given a ( sufficiently large ) set of monte carlo configurations , one can define the expectation values with a cut by averaging only over configurations for which the chosen indicator is below a certain value .",
    "the correlations between the two size indicators mentioned above are now being studied for @xmath14 in 4 dimensions .",
    "the implementation of the second step requires technologies that are now being developed in the scalar case . as it seems only possible to make analytical calculations for small or large field cuts , numerical methods seem unavoidable . for the purpose of independent verification ,",
    "it is important to consider different methods .",
    "we are presently working on three different approaches :    1 .",
    "the conventional approach @xcite but with the @xmath159 having a finite range of integration .",
    "this type of approach works well in the scalar case @xcite 2 .",
    "the stochastic approach @xcite where @xmath159 is expanded as power series in @xmath7 . for the lowest order field , the implementation of a cut is obvious but not for higher order fields .",
    "this problem is being considered with simple examples .",
    "3 .   fits from numerical data at large @xmath6 .",
    "this method @xcite allowed to extract at least 2 coefficients of conventional perturbation . as we mentioned above , it is easy to implement the field cut with monte carlo methods .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it does not require the use of the campbell - baker - hausdorff ( for a short review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) formula .",
    "we expect that the use of theses three methods will allow us to contruct perturbative series with a finite radius of convergence as above .",
    "we hope that this radius of convergence will be sufficiently large to reach the scaling window .",
    "ultimately , we expect to be able to replace the numerical calculation of the coefficients by approximate analytical formulas , as it seems possible to do in the case of the anharmonic oscillator @xcite ."
