    "the shape of the initial mass function ( imf ) is an important parameter to understand the fragmentation of molecular clouds and therefore the formation and development of stellar systems . besides studies of the solar neighbourhood ( salpeter @xcite , tsujimoto et al .",
    "@xcite ) , work on star clusters plays a major role ( scalo @xcite ) in this field , as age , metallicity , and distance of all stars of a star cluster can generally be assumed to be equal .",
    "restricted to certain mass intervals , the imf can be described by a power law in the form @xmath6 in this notation the `` classical '' value found by salpeter ( @xcite ) for the solar neighbourhood is @xmath7 .",
    "average values for @xmath8 from more recent studies , mostly of star clusters , can be found , e.g. , in scalo ( @xcite ) : @xmath9 where the `` @xmath10 '' values refer to a rough range of the slopes derived for the corresponding mass intervals , caused by empirical uncertainties or probable real imf variations .",
    "knowledge of membership is essential to derive the imf especially of open star clusters , where the contamination of the data with field stars presents a major challenge .",
    "two methods for field star subtraction are in use nowadays : separating field and cluster stars by means of membership probabilities from stellar proper motions on one hand , statistical field star subtraction on the other hand .",
    "our work combines these two methods : the proper motions are investigated for the bright stars of the clusters , down to the completeness limit of the photographic plates used , whereas the fainter cluster members are selected with statistical considerations .    from the cleaned data we derive the luminosity and mass functions of the clusters . including the proper motions",
    ", we expect to receive a more reliable imf , since the small number of bright stars in open clusters would lead to higher uncertainties , if only statistical field star subtraction were applied .",
    "this is the second part of a series of studies of open star clusters , following sanner et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . here",
    "we present data on two clusters of the northern hemisphere , ngc1960 ( m36 ) and ngc2194 .    ngc1960 ( m36 ) is located at @xmath11 , @xmath12 and has a diameter of @xmath13 according to the lyng ( @xcite ) catalogue .",
    "morphologically , ngc1960 is dominated by a number of bright ( @xmath14 ) stars , whereas the total stellar density is only marginally enhanced compared to the surrounding field .",
    "the cluster has not yet been studied by means of ccd photometry .",
    "photographic photometry was published by barkhatova et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , photoelectric photometry of 50 stars in the region of the cluster by johnson & morgan ( @xcite ) .",
    "the most recent proper motion studies are from meurers ( @xcite ) and chian & zhu ( @xcite ) .",
    "as their epoch differences between first and second epoch plates ( 36 and 51 years , respectively ) are smaller than ours and today s measuring techniques can be assumed to be more precise we are confident to gain more reliable results .",
    "tarrab ( @xcite ) published an imf study of 75 open star clusters , among them ngc1960 , and found an exteme value for the slope of ( in our notation ) @xmath15 for this object .",
    "her work includes only 25 stars in the mass range @xmath16 , so that a more detailed study covering more members and reaching towards smaller masses is necessary .    for ngc2194 ( located at @xmath17 , @xmath18 , diameter @xmath19 ) ,",
    "our work is the first proper motion study according to van leeuwen ( @xcite ) .",
    "the _ rgu _ photographic photometry of delrio ( @xcite ) is the most recent publication on ngc2194 including photometric work .",
    "the cluster is easily detectable as it contains numerous intermediate magnitude ( @xmath20 ) stars , although bright stars @xmath21 are lacking .    in sect .",
    "[ cadata ] , we present the data used for our studies and the basic steps of data reduction and analysis . sects .",

    "we conclude with a summary and discussion in sect .",

    "ccd images of both clusters were taken with the 1.23 m telescope at calar alto observatory on october 15 , 1998 , in photometric conditions .",
    "the seeing was of the order of @xmath22 .",
    "the telescope was equipped with the @xmath23 pix ccd chip tek 7_12 with a pixel size of @xmath24 and the wwfpp focal reducing system ( reif et al .",

    "the limits were chosen individually for each image , typical values are @xmath33 to @xmath34 for the magnitudes , @xmath35 to @xmath36 for sharpness , and @xmath37 to @xmath38 for @xmath32 .",

    "the single errors are of the order of @xmath39      according to the field star subtracted cmd , presented as fig .",
    "[ n2194cmdhaufen ] , ngc2194 shows a prominent main sequence with a turn - off point near @xmath40 and a sparsely populated red giant branch . for this cluster ,",
    "the proper motion study is not of great value for the isochrone fitting process : as the main sequence turn - off is located around @xmath40 , it is clear that the bright blue stars either do not belong to the cluster or do not help in finding the best isochrone fit because of their non - standard evolution like blue stragglers ( see , e.g. , stryker @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the presence of the blue bright stars is mainly caused by the coincidence of the field and cluster proper motion centres which causes a certain number of fields stars to be mis - identified as cluster members . as expected in sect .",
    "[ n2194pm ] , this effect is more dramatic here than in the case of ngc1960 . from the comarison of the isochrones we derived the parameters for ngc2194 given in table [ caparams ] .",

    "38 of our sample was first mentioned by delrio ( @xcite , star 160 therein ) who considers this object a field star as a consequence of its location in the cmd .",
    "for the same reason , but with the opposite conclusion , ahumada & lapasset ( @xcite ) mention this object as a cluster member in their `` catalogue of blue stragglers in open star clusters '' .",
    "we find for this star a proper motion of @xmath43 and @xmath44 leading to a membership probability of 0.34 .",
    "therefore , we agree with delrio and assume star 38 to be a field star , too .",
    "so far , no further information is known about the bright blue stars in fig .",
    "[ n2194cmdhaufen ] , so that we can not give any definite statement about the nature of these objects .",
    "the age of ngc2194 of @xmath45 myr  together with its distance of almost @xmath46 kpc  implies that the range of the observable main sequence is very limited .",
    "we therefore could compute the imf only over the mass interval from @xmath47 ( corresponding to @xmath48 ) to @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 ) .",
    "the slope determined is @xmath5 .",
    "the comparably higher error is a consequence of the smaller mass interval .    comparing the resulting imf with a histogram ( see fig .",
    "[ n2194imfplot ] ) , one finds good agreement for three of the four bins ( the bin width is the same as for ngc1960 ) .",
    "as the completeness drops rapidly within the leftmost bin , it has  in total  a high uncertainty .",
    "however , only stars with masses of @xmath51 ( corresponding to a completeness of higher than 60% ) were taken into consideration for the imf computation , which is indicated by the limits of the imf line in fig .",
    "[ n2194imfplot ] .",
    "note that as a consequence of the age of ngc2194 , the cluster may have encountered dynamical evolution during its lifetime , which has to be kept in mind when using the term `` _ initial _ mass function '' .",
    "however , we follow scalo s ( @xcite ) nomenclature , who uses the expression for intermediate age clusters , to discriminate between a mass function based on the initial and the present day stellar masses .     initial mass function of ngc2194",
    ". the solid histogram corresponds to the completeness corrected values , the dotted one to the original data .",
    "the imf slope is determined to be @xmath52 .",
    "note that the slope was determined with a maximum likelihood analysis ; the histogram is only plotted for demonstration .",
    "the length of the line illustrates the mass interval for which the imf was computed ]",
    "with our work we found ngc1960 to be a young open star cluster with an age of 16 myr .",
    "it is located at a distance of 1300 pc from the sun .",
    "these results confirm the findings of barkhatova et al .",
    "( @xcite ) obtained with photographic photometry .",
    "we derived proper motions of 404 stars in the region of the cluster down to @xmath53 .",
    "178 of those can be considered members of ngc1960 . despite the problems with our proper motion determination ( see sect .",
    "[ n1960eb ] ) , we are able to state that our results do not support the values given as the absolute proper motion of ngc1960 by glushkova et al .",
    "( @xcite ) on the base of the `` four million star catalog '' ( gulyaev & nesterov @xcite ) : they found @xmath54 which is in agreement with our study , but @xmath55 which differs from our result by more than @xmath56 .",
    "our study of the imf of ngc1960 led to a power law with a slope of @xmath4 .",
    "this value is very high ( i.e. the imf is shallow ) compared to other studies , however , it still matches the interval for @xmath8 suggested by scalo ( @xcite ) for intermediate mass stars ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "although we should stress that we can not say anything about the shape of the imf in the very low mass range ( @xmath58 ) , we do not see any evidence for a flattening of the imf of ngc 1960 below @xmath59 .",
    "ngc2194  with an age of 550 myr  belongs to the intermediate age galactic open star clusters .",
    "our findings from the photometric study are in good agreement with the photographic @xmath60 photometry published by delrio ( @xcite ) .",
    "as the cluster is located at a distance of almost 3 kpc we could only cover its mass spectrum down to @xmath59 .",
    "nevertheless , we were able to determine the imf on the base of 623 main sequence stars which led to a slope of @xmath5 , almost salpeter s ( @xcite ) value , but still close to the shallow end of the interval given by scalo ( @xcite ) .    in our previous paper ( sanner et al .",
    "@xcite ) , we studied the open star cluster ngc581 ( m103 ) for which we found the same age of @xmath61 myr as for ngc1960 , but a much steeper imf slope of @xmath62 .",
    "we therefore can state that our method of imf determination does not systematically lead to steep or shallow mass functions .    with our yet very small sample ,",
    "it is not possible to find evidence for the dependence of the imf of open star clusters on any parameter of the cluster .",
    "therefore , we will have to investigate further clusters and also compare our results with other studies .",
