    "the history of star formation in the universe is one of the key function in physical cosmology .",
    "it is closely linked to galaxy formation and evolution and controls the second most important contribution to the cosmic electromagnetic background after the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) generated at the time of recombination at a redshift around 1000 .",
    "it has been pointed out many times in the past 30 years , that measurements of the cosmic background radiated by all galaxies over the history of the universe would be extremely valuable for physical cosmology .",
    "it would strongly constrain models for galaxy formation and evolution ( see for example partridge & peebles , 1967 ) .",
    "this background is expected to be composed of three main components : + - the stellar radiation in galaxies concentrated in the ultra - violet and visible with a redshifted component in the near infrared ( ir ) + - a fraction of the stellar radiation absorbed by dust either in the galaxies or in the intergalactic medium + - the radiation from active galactic nuclei ( a fraction of which is also absorbed by dust and reradiated in the far - ir ) .",
    "+ the energy in the first two components is derived from nucleosynthesis in stars , the last one probably derived from gravitational energy of accreted matter onto massive black holes . in the last two years the cosmic background at visible , ir and submillimeter ( submm ) wavelengths has been finally constrained by very deep source counts and upper limits on the diffuse isotropic emission at shorter wavelengths , and measured in the submm range .",

    "[ formalism ] , we define the formalism of the determination of the ir radiation production rate history . when the spectrum of the sources dominating the background is strongly peaked around a wavelength of 80 @xmath3 m , the radiation production rate as a function of redshift can be directly inferred from the spectrum of the cosmic background . in sect .",
    "[ source_spectra ] , the sources of cosmic far - ir background ( cfirb ) and their spectra are rewiewed . in the likely hypothesis of this background being dominated by ir galaxies ( either starburst galaxies or dust enshrouded agns ) , we derive the ir radiation production rate as a function of redshift in the universe ( sect . [ inversion ] ) . we compare it with other means to measure the star formation rate in sect .",
    "+ the study presented here is different from the many studies of this type based on a model for spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and evolution of ir galaxies which , after some adjustements , account for the cosmic background . considering the diversity of sed which can be used and the observational uncertainties it is clear that a range of histories of the ir galaxies is possible .",
    "the goal of this paper and of the method presented here is to explore systematically the range of possible solutions by a careful analysis of possible seds taking properly into account the observational uncertainties .",
    "the method developed in this paper is the only one so far to answer this question .",
    "we summarise here the observational situation of the cosmic background which is the main observation used in this study .",
    "the values of the cosmic background at all wavelengths are discussed in appendix 1 and shown on fig .",

    "we measure here a higher ratio which is about 1 - 2.6 .",
    "this higher ratio results from two combined effects .",
    "first , the redshift effect will bring the light from optical to ir and thus will give more energy in the ir than for local galaxies .",
    "nevertheless this effect can not account for an ir to optical ratio much larger on average than the value observed today .",
    "this higher ratio can only be explained by a change of properties of galaxies that are making the background in the optical and the ir .",
    "a very simple comparison supports this idea : the energy in the backgound at 15 @xmath3 m and in the optical domain is nearly the same . but the background at 15 @xmath3 m in the hubble deep field is made by a very small number of objects as compared to the number of sources which contribute to the bulk of the energy observed in the optical ( aussel et al .",
    "this means that the background in the ir is probably dominated by few objects with high ir luminosities",
    ". thus these objects are not the standard ir counterparts of normal spiral and irregular galaxies .",

    "[ source_spectra ] . the important result of this discussion is that all the far - ir seds of luminous ir galaxies are not very dependent of the energy source ( starburst or dust enshrouded agn ) and varies slowly with the luminosity ( maffei , 1994 ; guiderdoni 1998 ) .",

    "+ the history of the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) can be derived from deep optical surveys assuming that ( 1 ) the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is universal , ( 2 ) the far - uv light is proportionnal to the sfr and ( 3 ) extinction is negligible .",
    "the presence of dust which absorbes most of the uv starlight in starburst galaxies makes this last assumption highly questionable .",
    "the corrections needed to account for extinction are rather uncertain and there is much controversy about the value of this correction .",
    "moreover , the sfr deduced from optical surveys can be underestimated if there is a significant population of objects so obscured that they are not detected in these surveys .",
    "a direct determination of the fraction of the stellar radiation reradiated by dust can be obtained from the ir / submm surveys if the dust enshrouded agns do not dominate .",

    "<S> the cosmic background due to the integrated radiation from galaxies over the whole life of the universe is reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this background is well constrained by measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the total power in the background is in the range 60 - 93 nwm@xmath0sr@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the data show the existence of a minimum separating the direct stellar radiation from the infrared part due to radiation reemitted by dust . </S>",
    "<S> this reemitted dust radiation is about 1 - 2.6 time the background power in the optical / near - ir thus much larger than the same ratio measured locally ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the far - infrared and submillimeter background is likely to be dominated by redshifted infrared galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the long wavelength spectrum of the background being significantly flatter than the spectrum of these galaxies it strongly constrains the far - infrared radiation production rate history which must increase by a factor larger than 10 between the present time and a redshift 1 and then stays rather constant at higher redshift , contrary to the ultraviolet radiation production rate which decreases rapidly .    </S>",
    "<S> several models of galaxy evolution have been proposed to explain the submillimeter background . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we do not propose a new model ; we systematically explore the allowed range of evolution histories allowed by the data . if infrared galaxies are mostly powered by starbursts as indicated by recent observations , </S>",
    "<S> this infrared production history reflects the history of star formation in the universe . </S>"
