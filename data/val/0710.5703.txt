    "as it was formulated by woodrow wilson , opinion ultimately governs the world @xcite ; the common interest in its research is then more than justified .",
    "the rule of the public opinion ( po ) got a new dimension when the mass media appeared at the beginning of the 20-th century .",
    "the change was recognized by walter lippmann who shaped our understanding of po @xcite . in social sciences ,",
    "large effort is devoted to capture necessary ingredients of a qualitative description of po @xcite .",
    "however , the role of structure of the social network was also thoroughly investigated @xcite .",
    "the main message from the social sciences is that the po dynamics proceeds in a landscape of established identifications .",
    "then , variations of po are possible through local current reinterpretations of political events rather than through converting of large groups @xcite . important difference  the so called pluralistic ignorance  appears between the actual and the expressed opinion , and it is only the latter which influences the dynamics @xcite .",
    "physicists entered to the field via statistical mechanics @xcite ; a recent review on this kind of research of po dynamics can be found in ref . .",
    "in these quantitative models , main role is played by the structure of social networks .",
    "actual shape of this structure is a matter of discussion @xcite and simple solutions can not be expected . however ,",
    "various models have been and continuously are constructed to capture this or that feature of the structure of at least selected social groups .",
    "the voter model describes the opinion spreading via links of direct neighborhood @xcite . in the sznajd model @xcite an accordance of two neighbors is necessary to influence other neighbors of the pair . in the deffuant model @xcite",
    ", attention is paid to the difference of opinion of the neighbors ; if this is too large , the transfer of opinion is blocked .",
    "these efforts seem to complete a consistent path towards a realistic although model description of the po dynamics within the social structure approximated by a network .",
    "the aim of this work is to make next step in this direction .",
    "the choice we have to make is twofold : to select the dynamic rule and to select the structure .",
    "here we use the sznajd model ; in our opinion this model gives a bridge from the granovetter s concept of threshold @xcite to computer simulations . here the threshold is set as two persons , what is an important generalization of the voter model and what allows to take into account the correlations of opinions of neighbors .",
    "the structure of our model network is random and clustered @xcite , it shows the small - world property @xcite and it contains directed links ; the last condition comes from the observed asymmetry of social relations @xcite .",
    "below in the text , the construction of the network is described in detail .",
    "here we concentrate on the calculations of the time @xmath0 of getting a stationary distribution of opinions . in this final stage",
    "although local opinions can change , the average opinion calculated over the whole network remains constant . in political sciences , the initial support for a new government collapses in some time , which can be identified by @xmath0 . to give examples from recent polish history",
    ", the timescale of this fall seems to be about two years ( jerzy buzek ) or shorter ( leszek miller ) @xcite .",
    "we note that our calculations do not capture the metastable states of po , where the majority is silent and activates only during an open debate @xcite .",
    "the model society is the directed network @xcite based on the erds ",
    "rnyi random graph @xcite with enhanced clusterization @xcite .",
    "the primary network is constructed such that each node has exactly three out - going links , i.e. @xmath1 , as presented in fig .",

    "the @xmath0 dependence on @xmath8 is slower than just @xmath38 ; the latter could be expected if the decrease of @xmath8 is equivalent just to slowing the process down .",
    "the difference can be due to the fact , that once @xmath39 , some nodes are not updated at a given time step .",

    "the results on the time @xmath0 of getting stationary state are compared to the analytical calculations for the fully connected network @xcite .",
    "although the dependence of @xmath0 on the initial state is different than in theory , the system size dependence of @xmath0 is the same .",
    "the message for the social applications is that the time of attaining the stationary distribution increases linearly with the system size . among other consequences",
    ", this means that an initial support for a new government persists twice longer in a twice larger country ; larger countries have more time for reforms .",
    "still , even if the initial state is the longest - living @xmath42 , this time is not infinite , as it is shown in fig .",
