    "strong x - ray pulsations with a 2.49 msec period were discovered from sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = in an april 1998 observation with the rossi x - ray timing explorer @xcite . the pulsar is a member of an accreting binary system with an orbital period of 2.01 hour and a low - mass companion @xcite . though similar to other low - mass x - ray binaries in its timing and spectral properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = is unique for its x - ray pulsations .",
    "no other such binary has shown coherent pulsations in its persistent flux despite of careful searches ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "as such , sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = is the fastest rotating accreting neutron star .",
    "if the pulsations are due to modulated emission from one hot spot on the neutron star surface , the 2.49 msec period corresponds to an equatorial speed of approximately 0.1c . with these high speeds , sax j1808.4 - 3658 +",
    "= offers an excellent system for studying relativistic effects .",
    "one such effect may be the observed lag of low - energy photons relative to high - energy photons in the pulse discovered by @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the lags are due to comptonization in a relatively cool surrounding medium .",
    "alternatively , the lags may be the result of a relativistic effect : the high - energy photons are preferentially emitted at earlier phases due to doppler boosting along the line of sight .",
    "this possibility was suggested for the similar lags in the 549  hz oscillations in an x - ray burst of aql  x-1 @xcite , where a simple model showed that the delays roughly match those expected .    in the following , we present new measurements of the pulsed emission from sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = .",
    "we show that the energy - dependent phase lags are equivalent to a hardening pulse profile .",
    "we model this behavior in terms of a hot spot on the neutron star , including relativistic effects .",
    "we have used publicly available data from the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board rxte in an ` event ' mode with high time resolution ( 122@xmath2sec ) and high energy resolution ( 64 channels ) .",
    "the observations occurred from april 10 1998 to may 7 1998 , when the source was in outburst .",
    "we generate folded lightcurves in each pca channel .",
    "this is accomplished with the fasebin tool in ftools version 4.2 , which applies all known xte clock corrections and corrects photon arrival times to the solar system barycenter using the jpl de-200 ephemeris , yielding a timing accuracy of several @xmath2sec ( much less than the phase binning used here ) . as a check ,",
    "we have applied this method to crab pulsar data and the results are identical to @xcite . to produce pulse profiles in the neutron star rest frame , we use the sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = orbital ephemeris found by @xcite .",
    "an example folded lightcurve is shown in figure  [ lc ] ( top ) for the observation of april 18 1998 14:05:40 to april 19 1998 00:51:44 utc .",
    "to study the energy spectra at each phase bin , we take the rates at pulse minimum and subtract it from the rest of the data at other phases .",
    "this effectively accomplishes background subtraction and eliminates the unpulsed emission which we do not wish to consider .",
    "note , however , that the pulsed emission may have some contribution even at the pulse minimum and this subtraction scheme represents only a best approximation to the true pulse emission .",
    "we generate detector response matrices appropriate to the observation date and data mode using pcarsp v2.38 , and use xspec v.10.0 to fit model spectra .",
    "we fit the spectrum here with a simple powerlaw function .",
    "though the function itself is not meant to be a physical description , the powerlaw index provides a good measure of the spectral hardness .",
    "fits in each phase bin have reduced @xmath3 of 0.7 to 1.6 . including an interstellar absorption does not substantially affect these results .",
    "the powerlaw index clearly increases through the pulse phase ( figure  [ lc ] , bottom ) , i.e. spectrum evolves from hard to soft .",
    "we also fit the profiles of the folded lightcurves in each channel using fourier functions at the fundamental frequency and its harmonics . from these fits",
    "we determine the phase lag in each channel relative to the fits in some baseline channel range .",
    "results for the 18 april 1998 observation are shown in figure  [ lags ] as solid symbols .",
    "note that negative numbers indicate that high - energy photons precede low - energy photons .",
    "we are also able to measure lags in the first harmonic , and find that they are opposite in sign to the fundamental , i.e. low - energy photons precede high - energy photons in the first harmonic .",
    "no lags are measurable in the other harmonics .",
    "another way to measure energy - dependent phase lags is by fourier cross - correlation analysis .",
    "this is the method used for sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = by @xcite and for other timing signals as well , e.g. kilohertz qpos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for a description of cross correlation analysis see e.g. @xcite . from the pca event mode data we calculate fourier spectra in various channel ranges with nyquist frequency of 2048 hz and resolution of 0.25 hz .",
    "we then calculate cross spectra defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are the complex fourier coefficients for two energy bands at the pulsar frequency @xmath6 .",
    "the phase lag between the two energy bands is given by the argument of @xmath7 .",
    "we measure all phase delays relative to the unbinned channels range 5 to 8 , i.e. 1.83 to 3.27 kev for 5 detector units in pca gain epoch 3 ( april 15 1996 to march 22 1999 ) .",
    "the results for the 18 april 1998 observation , are shown in figure  [ lags ] by the open symbols .",
    "the phase lags are consistent with those calculated from the lightcurve fitting . from the cross - correlation spectra",
    "we are not able to measure lags in the much weaker harmonics .",
    "we have calculated phase lag spectra also for other rxte observations during the april 1998 outburst .",
    "these spectra are similar to that in figure  [ lags ] .",
    "to quantify the trends , we compute an average phase delay , @xmath8 , over all energies for each observation .",
    "we also fit a broken powerlaw function to each phase delay spectrum : @xmath9 below a break energy , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 above this energy .",
    "figure  [ lags_v_time ] shows the quantities @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath12 versus the time of each observation .    there is a clear connection between the results of the two analyses presented here .",
    "the phase resolved spectroscopy shows that the spectrum softens and correspondingly the peak of the pulse profile appears slightly earlier in phase for higher energies ( figure  [ lc ] ) .",
    "the method of measuring phase delays shows the same behavior : higher - energy photons preferentially lead lower - energy photons in the fundamental and the magnitude of this phase delay increases with energy ( figure  [ lags ] ) . in the following we discuss a model that can account for the phase delays / spectral softening measured here .",
    "we calculate the expected luminosity as a function of phase in a manner similar to @xcite but including doppler effects @xcite and time of flight delays @xcite .",
    "this treatment is based on a schwarzschild metric , where the photon trajectories are completely determined by the compactness , @xmath13 .",
    "the predicted luminosity as a function of phase from our code matches the results of @xcite and @xcite for the various choices of parameters .",
    "@xcite recently developed a model for pulse profiles using a slightly different approach .",
    "the parameters in the model are the speed at the equator of the neutron star , @xmath14 , the mass of the neutron star , @xmath15 , the compactness , @xmath13 , the angular size of the cap , @xmath16 , and the viewing angles , @xmath17 ( the angle between the rotation axis and the cap center ) and @xmath18 ( rotation axis to line of sight ) .",
    "another ingredient is the emission from the spot , which we take as isotropic and isothermal .",
    "the spectrum of energy emitted from the spot is another important input .",
    "note that if the emitted spectrum is power law like , the observed spectrum will not evolve with phase , since doppler transformation preserves the shape ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the intrinsic spectrum must therefore have some shape that transforms to match the observed hardening and phase lags ; we use a blackbody spectrum with temperature @xmath19 .",
    "a fit from the model is shown in figure  [ lags ] .",
    "this fit uses the following model parameters : @xmath20 , @xmath21\\c\\else\\if'\\c\\else\\space\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi}\\else\\if\\empty\\c\\else\\if\\space\\c\\else\\space\\fi\\fi\\fi}\\fi}}}$ ] , @xmath22 kev , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 . to derive count rates , we use table models in xspec and the appropriate response files as discussed above .",
    "the fit for this single set of parameters is good ; we find @xmath26 from the fourier cross - correlation data or a reduced @xmath3 of 0.8 for all the parameters fixed .",
    "a full exploration of the parameter space of the model is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "we note the following trends , however .",
    "the magnitude of the phase lags depends sensitively on @xmath14 and @xmath19 .",
    "larger delays result from higher speeds , because the pulses become increasingly asymmetric due to doppler boosting .",
    "this asymmetry is also energy dependent , so there is a dependence on @xmath19 as well ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the lags also depend on @xmath17 and @xmath18 , especially at higher energies where there is the turn - over noted above .",
    "the phase lags are less sensitive to @xmath13 and @xmath16 .",
    "we have tested the assumption of isotropic emission and found that the phase lags depend only weakly on the beaming .",
    "the pulsed emission from sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = evolves through its phase from a relatively hard to a soft spectrum , as shown by our phase resolved spectroscopy ( figure  [ lc ] ) .",
    "this evolution can also be thought of , and measured as , an energy - dependent phase lag in the fundamental ( figure  [ lags ] ) , i.e. higher - energy photons emerging earlier in phase than lower - energy photons .",
    "we have applied a model to the data which consists of a hot spot on the rotating neutron star under a general relativistic treatment .",
    "the dominant effect accounting for energy - dependent delays is doppler boosting , the larger boosting factors at earlier phases giving harder spectra .",
    "the model fits the data quite well .",
    "the model also provides a stable mechanism for generating the phase delays , which meshes with the fact that the characteristic delays remain stable in time to within 25% ( figure  [ lags_v_time ] ) even as there is a factor of two decrease in the x - ray flux , a possible tracer of accretion rate . as noted in @xcite , in addition to explaining the energy - dependent phase lags in sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = , this mechanism may also account for the lags in the burst oscillations of aql x-1 @xcite and kilohertz qpos @xcite .",
    "phase resolved spectroscopy has not yet been possible in these signals .",
    "the model offers a new means of measuring the neutron star mass and radius , a notoriously difficult problem in accreting binary systems . the radius is directly related to @xmath14 , the equatorial speed ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the fits also depend on the model parameters @xmath15 and @xmath13 , though the lag spectra are less sensitive to these quantities .",
    "the model could be independently constrained by future optical spectroscopy of the companion which could provide information on @xmath15 and the viewing angles , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we acknowledge stimulating discussions with the participants of the august 1999 aspen workshop on relativity where an early version of this work was presented .",
    "we thank michiel van der klis , mariano mndez and luigi stella for helpful discussions .",
