    "nuclear giant resonances have been known since 50 years ago for the dipole mode and more than 30 years for the other modes . but the research field was limited to the excitations of nuclei along the @xmath4-stability line@xcite .",
    "recently , the radioactive ion beam physics has become one of the frontiers in nuclear physics .",
    "it offers the possibility to broaden the study of the giant resonance to weakly bound nuclei .",
    "nuclei close to the drip line present some unique properties : a small separation energy of the valence nucleon , the smearing density distribution and a strong coupling between the bound state and the particle continuum .",
    "those exotic properties attract more attentions both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "low - lying electric dipole modes may appear in these weakly bound nuclei , which are so - called pygmy dipole resonances .",
    "although carrying only a small fraction of the full dipole strength these states are of particular interest because they are expected to reflect the motion of the neutron skin against the core formed with an equal number of protons and neutrons .",
    "recent experiments have shown that the increase of the dipole strength at low energies in neutron - rich nuclei could affect the corresponding radiative neutron capture cross section considerably@xcite , which has a significance in astrophysics . over the last decade ,",
    "much experimental and theoretical efforts have been dedicated to investigate properties of the low - lying dipole mode in light neutron - rich nuclei , in particular , to answer whether or not these dipole excitations can be attributed to the collectivity@xcite .",
    "recently , beaumel et al.@xcite have measured the inelastic scattering of @xmath0ne + @xmath5pb using a 60 mev / u @xmath0ne secondary beam at riken .",
    "this reaction is dominated by coulomb excitations and selective for @xmath6 transitions .",
    "the experimental data are now under analysis@xcite . as a subsequent work",
    ", they will continue the experiment using a more neutron rich projectile @xmath1ne .",
    "therefore the theoretical investigation of low - lying dipole modes in @xmath0ne and @xmath1ne has a practical significance . @xmath0ne and @xmath1ne are neutron rich nuclei , whose fermi surfaces are close to the particle continuum",
    ". therefore the description of those nuclei has to explicitly include the coupling between bound states and the particle continuum .",
    "the contribution of the particle continuum to the nuclear properties at low - energies can mainly be attributed to a few resonant states@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that pairing correlations play an important role in describing properties of open shell nuclei . in order to depict the collective excitations of those nuclei pairing correlations have to be taken into account .",
    "recently , a number of theoretical works has devoted to study the properties of low - lying dipole modes in the framework of the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa)@xcite .",
    "paar and his co - workers@xcite have studied the evolution of the low - lying dipole strength in sn - isotopes in the quasiparticle relativistic random phase approximation ( qrrpa ) in the configuration space formalism .    in this paper",
    ", we aim at the investigation of the properties of low - lying dipole modes in neutron rich nuclei @xmath0ne and @xmath1ne in the qrrpa which is formulated in the response function method .",
    "the qrrpa is an extension of the fully consistent rrpa @xcite by taking into account the effect of pairing correlations .",
    "a consistent treatment of rrpa within the rmf approximation requires the configurations including not only the pairs formed from the occupied fermi states and unoccupied states but also the pairs formed from the dirac states and occupied fermi states .",
    "it has been emphasized in refs.@xcite that the inclusion of configurations built from the positive energy states in the fermi sea and negative energy states in the dirac sea is essential to give correctly a quantitative description in the excitation energies of isoscalar giant multipole resonances as well as to ensure the current conservation and decouple the spurious states . in present calculations ,",
    "we pay more attentions to the energy weighted moment @xmath7 and the centroid energy of the low - lying dipole strength as well as the contribution of states around the fermi surface to the low - lying dipole strength .",
    "although some theoretical investigations show that @xmath0ne and @xmath1ne are deformed and strongly anharmonic@xcite , a spherical symmetry is assumed in the present investigation . in order to show the applicability of the method with a spherical assumption we also study the quadrupole excitations in these nuclei and compare the calculated position and transition strength of the lowest 2@xmath8 states with the experimental data .    in this work ,",
    "the ground state properties of neutron rich nuclei @xmath0ne and @xmath1ne are calculated in the extended relativistic mean field and bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( rmf+bcs ) approxiamtion@xcite , where the resonant continuum is properly treated .",
    "the empirical pairing gaps deduced from odd - even mass differences are adopted in the bcs calculation in this work .",
    "all calculations are performed with the parameter set nl3@xcite , which gives a good description of not only the ground state properties@xcite but also the collective giant resonance@xcite .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we present the formalism of the qrrpa in the extended rmf+bcs ground state in the response function approach .",
    "a test of the numerical calculation of the qrrpa in the neutron rich nucleus @xmath2o is performed and compared with the results in ref@xcite , which is given in sec.iii . in sec.iv the ground state properties of @xmath0ne and @xmath1ne",
    "are studied in the extended rmf+bcs approach .",
    "then the qrrpa in the response function formalism is applied to study the properties of isovector giant dipole resonances in nuclei @xmath0ne and @xmath1ne .",
    "finally we give a brief summary in sec.v .",
    "there are usually two methods to obtain the rpa strength in the study of nuclear collective excitations .",
    "one is working in a particle - hole configuration space and solving the rpa equation by a matrix diagonalization method@xcite , and another is based on the linear response theory@xcite . in the response function",
    "formalism one solves a bethe - salpeter equation by inversion . in both methods",
    "the starting point is a self - consistent solution of the nuclear ground state . in this paper",
    "we shall work in the response function formalism and study nuclear dipole excitations in neutron rich nuclei .    in the rrpa calculation",
    "we first solve the dirac equation and equations of meson fields self - consistently in the coordinate space .",
    "the continuum is discretized by expanding nucleon spinors on a complete set basis , such as eigenfunctions in a spherical harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "those single particle states are used to build the rrpa configurations : a set of particle - hole pairs(@xmath9 ) and pairs formed from the negative energy state in the dirac sea and the hole state in the fermi sea(@xmath10 ) .",
    "the response function of a quantum system to an external field is given by the imaginary part of the polarization operator : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an external field operator .",
    "the rrpa polarization operator is obtained by solving the bethe - salpeter equation :    -0.50 cm @xmath13    in the rrpa , the residual particle - hole interactions are obtained from the same lagrangian as in the description of the nuclear ground state .",
    "they are generated by exchanging various mesons : the isoscalar scalar meson @xmath14 , the isoscalar vector meson @xmath15 and the isovector vector meson @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , in eq.(2 ) the sum @xmath17 runs over @xmath14 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 mesons , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the corresponding coupling constants and meson propagators .",
    "they are @xmath22 for @xmath23 meson and @xmath24 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 mesons , respectively .",
    "the meson propagators in the non - linear model are non - local in the momentum space , and therefore have to be calculated numerically .",
    "the detailed expressions of non - linear meson propagators @xmath25 can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath26 is the unperturbed polarization operator , which in a spectral representation has the following retarded form :      the unperturbed polarization operator includes not only the positive energy particle - hole pairs but also pairs formed from the dirac sea states and fermi sea states . in refs.@xcite the authors show that the inclusion of configurations built from the positive energy states in the fermi sea and negative energy states in the dirac sea is essential to give correctly a quantitative description in the excitation energies of isoscalar giant multipole resonances as well as to ensure the current conservation and decouple the spurious states .",
    "the pairing correlation and coupling to the continuum are important for exotic nuclei . a proper treatment of the resonant continuum to pairing correlations has been recently investigated in the hartree - fock ( hf ) bogoliubov or the hf+bcs approximation@xcite and the extended rmf+bcs approximation@xcite .",
    "it shows that the simple bcs approximation in the resonant continuum with a proper boundary condition works well in the description of ground state properties even for neutron rich nuclei .",
    "we shall treat the pairing correlation in the bcs approximation in this work and the resonant continuum is calculated by imposing an asymptotic scattering boundary condition .    when pairing correlations are taken into account ,",
    "the elementary excitation is a two - quasiparticle excitation , rather than a particle - hole excitation .",
    "the unperturbed polarization operator in the qrrpa in the response function formalism can be constructed in a similar way :      with @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the occupation probability and @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is the quasiparticle energy , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the fermi energy and pairing correlation gap , respectively . in the bcs approximation ,",
    "the @xmath35 is the eigenfunction of the single particle hamiltonian with an eigenvalue @xmath36 . in eq.(4 ) , terms in the first square bracket represent those excitations with one quasiparticle in fully or partial occupied states and one quasiparticle in partial occupied or unoccupied states .",
    "terms in the second square bracket describe all excitations between positive energy fully or partial occupied states and negative energy states in the dirac sea . for unoccupied positive energy states outside the pairing active space ,",
    "their energies are @xmath37 , occupation probabilities @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for fully occupied positive energy states ,",
    "the quasiparticle energy and the occupation probability are @xmath40 and @xmath41 in eq.(4 ) .",
    "states in the dirac sea are not involved in pairing correlations .",
    "therefore those quantities @xmath42 and @xmath43 are set to be @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "once the unperturbed polarization operator in the quasiparticle scheme is built , the qrrpa response function can be obtained by solving the bethe - salpeter equation ( 2 ) as usually done in the rrpa .",
    "in this section , we first check the validity of the present qrrpa calculations .",
    "we apply the qrrpa to calculate the response function of the isovector giant dipole resonance(ivgdr ) and the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance(isgqr ) in the neutron rich nucleus @xmath2o .",
    "similar calculations for the nucleus @xmath2o were recently performed by paar et al@xcite in the framework of the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov(rhb ) + qrrpa in the configuration space formalism .",
    "o. the solid curve represents the result calculated in the qrrpa approach . the result performed in the rrpa approach",
    "is shown by a dashed curve .",
    "all results are calculated with the effective lagrangian parameter set nl3.,title=\"fig : \" ] -4.50 cm    the ground state properties of the nucleus @xmath2o are calculated in the extended rmf+bcs approach@xcite with the parameter set nl3 .",
    "the neutron pairing gap is obtained from the experimental binding energies of neighboring nuclei , @xmath46 mev . in the qrrpa calculation particle - hole",
    "residual interactions are taken from the same effective interaction nl3 , which is used in the description of the ground state of @xmath2o .",
    "fully occupied states and states in the pairing active space are calculated self - consistently in the extended rmf+bcs approach in the coordinate space .",
    "the bcs active space is taken as all states in the @xmath47 shell as well as 1f@xmath48 state , which is a resonant state in @xmath2o .",
    "a scattering boundary condition is imposed in the resonant continuum .",
    "unoccupied states outside of the pairing active space are obtained by solving the dirac equation in the expansion on a set of the harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "the response functions of the nuclear system to the external operator are calculated at the limit of zero momentum transfer .",
    "it is also necessary to include the space - like parts of vector mesons in the qrrpa calculations , although they do not play role in the ground state@xcite .",
    "the consistent treatment guarantees the conservation of the vector current .    in fig.1",
    ", we show the response function of the ivgdr mode in @xmath2o calculated in the rrpa and qrrpa approaches . the isovector dipole operator used in the calculations is@xcite : @xmath49 which excites an @xmath50 type electric ( spin - non - flip ) @xmath51 and @xmath52 giant resonance with @xmath53 .",
    "the spurious state for exotic nuclei may appear at the energy around 1 mev in the ivgdr strength in numerical calculations due to the mixture of the isoscalar mode@xcite . in our present calculations , the spurious state is removed by slightly adjusting the coupling constant of the @xmath14 meson in the residual interaction by less than 1% , that does not affect the general results .    in general ,",
    "the ivgdr strengths in light stable nuclei are expected to be fragmented substantially .",
    "this also occurs in the response function of the ivgdr in neutron rich nuclei .",
    "more fragmented distributions around the gdr region in @xmath2o are observed in fig.1 .",
    "in addition to the characteristic peak of the ivgdr at the energy around 20 mev , the low - lying dipole strength appears at the excitation energy below 10 mev .",
    "it can be seen that the inclusion of pairing correlations enhances the low - lying dipole strength and has a slight effect on the strength at the normal dipole resonance .",
    "this illustrates the importance of including pairing correlations in the study of the low - lying isovector dipole strength in neutron rich nuclei .",
    "the effect of pairing correlations on the isovector dipole strength in @xmath2o observed in our calculation is consistent with that obtained in the rhb+qrrpa in the configuration formalism ( fig.2 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "o. notations are the same as in fig.1.,title=\"fig : \" ] -4.50",
    "cm    the response functions of the isgqr mode in @xmath2o calculated in the rrpa and qrrpa approaches are shown in fig.2 . in present calculation",
    "the isoscalar quadrupole operator is taken from ref.@xcite : @xmath54    the inclusion of pairing correlations shifts the low - lying quadrupole strength to higher energy region and enhances the low - lying quadrupole strength , while this only slightly affect the strength at the normal giant resonance region .",
    "a similar result on the isoscalar quadrupole strength in @xmath2o has been observed in fig.3 of ref.@xcite in the framework of the rhb+qrrpa .    .",
    "the energy weighted moment @xmath7 at @xmath55 60 mev for the electric isovector dipole and isoscalar quadrupole excitations in @xmath2o .",
    "dc represents the result from double commutators in the non - relativistic approach .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     although the hartree low - lying strength is mainly formed from the neutron excitations , the rpa strengths are fully correlated and contributed from both neutron and proton . to illustrate the contribution of the proton to the full strength we set a very small value of the neutron effective charge in the dipole operator instead of @xmath56 .",
    "results are plotted in fig.5 .",
    "the short - dashed curves represent the strengths from proton , which are compared with the full qrrpa strengths denoted by solid curves .",
    "it clearly shows that the proton also plays an important role in the perturbed strength even at low - lying dipole states .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", the authors have studied the evolution of collectivity in the isovector dipole response in the low - lying region for neutron - rich isotopes of o , ca , ni , zr , and sn using rrpa method .",
    "they conclude that in light neutron - rich nuclei , such as neutron - rich isotopes of o and ca , the onset of dipole strength in the low - lying region is due to single - particle excitations of the loosely bound neutrons . by analyzing the structure of rrpa strengths in low - lying region in nuclei @xmath0ne and @xmath1ne",
    ", we find that there are only several configurations contributing to the low - lying rrpa strengths and the rrpa strengths remain their positions compared to the hartree strengths in the low - energy region , which mean that the rrpa strengths in low - lying region in nuclei @xmath0ne and @xmath1ne are dominated by single - particle transitions .    in order to give a more clear description of those isovector low - lying dipole states obtained in the qrrpa approach ,",
