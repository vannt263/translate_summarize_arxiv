    "a number of polarized semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) and polarized proton - proton scattering ( pp ) experiments are measuring quark and gluon distributions via qcd analysis . unpolarized hadron fragmentation functions are input quantities for such analyses and currently limit the accuracy with which e.g. parton helicity distributions can be determined .",
    "two recent studies have extracted hadron fragmentation functions from datasets of hadron production in @xmath0  @xcite , and from a combination of @xmath0 , sidis and pp datasets  @xcite . in both studies ,",
    "the authors emphasize the need for a precision hadron multiplicity measurement from @xmath0 annihilation data at low center - of - mass energies , compared to the bulk of existing datasets taken at the large electron - positron collider ( lep ) at cern .",

    "presented in this section is a precision measurement of hadron multiplicities on about @xmath1 @xmath0 annihilation events taken with the belle experiment at kek , japan , at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath2 gev , @xmath3 mev below the @xmath4 resonance .",
    "the multiplicities are measured in dependence of @xmath5 , the hadron energy relative to half of the center - of - mass energy , on an interval @xmath6 .",

    "the belle detector contains several subsystems which allow for particle identification ( pid ) by imposing cuts on likelihood values extracted from measurements of these subsystems .",
    "the likelihood cut selections yield fairly accurate pid but need to be calibrated in the context of a high precision measurement , such that measured hadron yields can be corrected for particle misidentification .",
    "particle misidentification changes hadron yields up to @xmath9 for pions and up to @xmath10 for kaons , depending on hadron momentum .",
    "the correction is performed through an unfolding technique based on inverse @xmath11 pid probability matrices .",
    "pid probability matrices are obtained from analyzing decays of particles in which the species @xmath12 of the decay products can be determined through purely kinematic means . in such a sample , additional cuts on track pid likelihood variables selecting a species @xmath13 define a subsample of tracks .",
    "comparing the number of cut - selected tracks to the total number of tracks in the sample allows to extract pid probabilities @xmath14 .",
