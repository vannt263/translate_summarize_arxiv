    "string theory is a subject with beautiful connections to mathematics , in particular to differential and algebraic geometry .",
    "moreover , it is well known that string theory provides a consistent formulation of quantum gravity , and one of its nicest achievements is the microscopic count of black hole entropies in string theory that precisely reproduces the thermodynamic area law of bekenstein and hawking including corrections from higher derivative gravity couplings ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "however not only gravity is an automatic outcome of string interactions , but also gauge interactions follow from the string world sheet formulation .",
    "in addition , there exist a deep relation between gauge and gravitational interactions in string theory , which manifests itself in the form of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , namely the duality between quantum gravity in 5-dimensional anti - de sitter space ( @xmath0 ) and conformal gauge theories in four - dimensions on the boundary of @xmath0 ( the holographic principle ) .",
    "however , still one of the most important issues is how to relate string theory to the observables in the low energy physics world .",
    "specifically , since we know that string theory provides an unification of all interactions and particles , we want to know how the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles with gauge group @xmath1 and with 3 generations of quark and leptons follows from string theory .",
    "next , string theory should provide a framework for computing all couplings of the sm .",
    "space - time supersymmetry is automatically built into string theory ; hence we have to find out how supersymmetry gets broken in string theory , and what are the consequences of a possible low energy supersymmetry breakdown for the physics at the lhc .",
    "in fact , it is one of the most interesting problems in string phenomenology to provide a translation between the low energy effective string action and the chain of data , which is expected from the lhc . finally , it would be of course most desirable for string theory to provide new testable experimental signatures , like extra dimensions or the discovery of microscopic black holes and their hawking radiation , supporting in this way string theory ( or providing arguments for abandoning it )",
    ".    one possible approach to string theory is the _ top - down _ approach , which starts from the unification of gravity and gauge interactions at very high energies , and then tries to deduce all low energy observables from investigating the mathematical structures of the theory . although we do not yet know the typical string scale @xmath2 , where the unification of gravity and gauge interaction takes places , one often assumes , at least from a conservative point of view , that this happens at the planck scale of about @xmath3 ( there are also alternatives models with much lower string scale @xcite ) .",
    "however no direct experiments will guide us through the physics at such high energies , a fact which makes the top - down approach very troublesome .",
    "another problem for the top - down approach is the fast proliferation of string solutions , the so - called string landscape problem , which we will describe in the following .",
    "the string landscape is defined to be the space of all possible solutions of the string equations of motion . in ten space - time dimensions , there exist just five different formulations of string theory ( two heterotic strings , type i type iia and type iib superstrings ) .",
    "exploring several kind of duality symmetries , it is conjectured that all these string theories can be unified into m - theory , where also 11-dimensional supergravity is included .",
    "however the number of lower - dimensional string solutions , i.e. lower dimensional string groundstates , which are obtained after compactification , is enormous . already in 1984 , within the covariant lattice construction @xcite , the number of possible four - dimensional string ground states was estimated to be of order @xmath4 .",
    "more recently , the number of discrete flux vacua on a generic calabi - yau manifold was shown to be of order @xmath5 @xcite . taken seriously , this vast landscape of distinct string vacua really implies a big question mark concerning the predictivity of string theory , since each point in the landscape essentially corresponds to a different universe with different particle physics and cosmological properties . to deal with such a huge number of possibilities ,",
    "certain strategies are required in order to proceed within the top - down approach .",
    "one possible and legitimate approach is given by the investigation of the statistical properties of the string landscape .",
    "i.e. one has to determine by statistical methods what is the fraction of string vacua with good phenomenological properties .",
    "possible statistical correlations resp .",
    "anti - correlations would be especially worth to be discovered , like e.g. between the number of families and the rank of the low - energy gauge groups , because they could provide a step towards verifying or resp .",
    "falsifying string theory .",
    "in addition , it was argued that the landscape could be the clue for statistically explaining the hierarchy problem in physics , and especially the smallness of the observed cosmological constant .",
    "namely , the tiny observed value of @xmath6 could be statistically explained @xcite if the number of vacua is of order of @xmath7 , which indeed seems to be the case in string theory .",
    "eventually , the statistical approach is likely to be merged with the anthropic principle @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . concerning the evolution of the universe ( see e.g. @xcite )",
    ", the anthropic principle essentially requires a multiverse with a huge number of bubbles , with each being filled by one of the vacua of the landscape .",
    "the population of all possible bubbles in the universe is possible in the context of eternal inflation , where transitions between different bubbles due to quantum tunneling processes are going to happen .",
    "another useful insight into the landscape discussion might be provided by the quantum mechanical wave function ( hartle - hawking wave function @xcite ) of the universe , which describes a probability measure , namely the likelihood for each point in the landscape to be populated . in string theory , it is natural to assume that this probability measure is linked to an entropy functional in the landscape , i.e. the number of microscopic string excitations that correspond to each ground state .",
    "clearly , this point of view is reminiscent to the discussion of black hole entropies , where the macroscopic black hole entropy can be explained by counting the corresponding microscopic string degrees of freedom .",
    "we will come to an explicit proposal how to relate black hole entropies to probability functions in the flux landscape at the end of this paper .",
    "complementary to the top - down efforts , the _ bottom - up _ approach is very important for connecting string theory with the real world .",
    "here one tries to build consistent string models which contain as many sm features as possible .",
    "first one tries to build string models that contain as massless states the particles of the sm , gauge bosons and three families of quarks and leptons .",
    "next , one has to derive the low - energy effectice action of the massless fields , in order to compute their couplings , like gauge couplings and yukawa couplings , which eventually can be compared with the experimentally known values .",
    "here another problem has to be solved , namely the problem of moduli stabilization .",
    "string compactifications generically contain several massless moduli fields with flat potential , which correspond to geometrical or other parameters of the internal space .",
    "these have to be fixed , since the low - energy couplings of the massless fields are functions of the moduli . in order to make",
    "predictions one has to know the values of the moduli .",
    "in addition , massless moduli would overclose the universe and also cause un - observed new forces @xcite .    one additional guiding principle for string model building is the fact that , although the energy scale of the sm is around @xmath8 , the sm is not a complete model but certainly requires new physics at mass scales much higher than @xmath8 .",
    "in fact it is encouraging that several puzzles of the sm , most notably the hierarchy problem together with the problem of the missing dark energy , can be explained in one stroke , namely by low - energy space - time supersymmetry around the corners at about @xmath9 .",
    "this fact gave rise to the formulation of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) or some variants thereof .",
    "since supersymmetry is built into string theory from the very beginning , the discovery of low energy supersymmetry would be also an additional argument in favor of string theory .",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses can be nicely explained by the see - saw mechanism , pointing to another new energy scale between @xmath10 .",
    "finally , the unification of gauge coupling constants of the sm happens at the gut scale of @xmath11 , and gauge coupling apparently works best within the mssm",
    ". therefore neutrino masses and gauge coupling unification should be another ingredient for string model building .",
    "another window into new physics beyond the sm comes from astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "beautiful experiments , most notably cobe and wmap , provided a precise image of cosmic microwave background radiation including its small density variations . in this way the inflationary scenario of the early universe is now established as the standard model for cosmology . in addition , we know from the astrophysical measurements that our universe is spatially flat .",
    "its energy density is dominated to about @xmath12 by a dark energy component , which behaves very similarly to a positive cosmological constant .",
    "the explanation of this mysterious dark energy is one of the biggest challenges for astroparticle physics , and hence also for string theory .",
    "the remaining @xmath13 of the energy density is split into so far directly undiscovered dark matter particles ( wimps ) , which account for @xmath14 of the total energy density , and into a left - over @xmath15 component of visible sm matter fields .",
    "many properties of the dark matter fields are still unknown , although one very promising candidate for dark matter is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in the mssm .",
    "so , strings also should be helpful to identify the nature of dark matter .    in summary",
    ", successful string model building must take into account all these phenomenological boundary conditions coming from the sm , from particle physics beyond the sm and also from cosmology .",
    "the top - down constructions which start from the geometry of the compactification space must go hand in hand with the bottom - up approach , where one is guided by the phenomenological data . in this way , a ( not necessarily one - to - one ) map between geometrical and topological properties of the compactifications spaces and the particle physics observables will be provided .",
    "this dictionary between geometry / topology and particle physics / cosmology is one of the most interesting aspects of string theory , and will be demonstrated in this paper by several examples .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : in the next section we discuss heterotic string compactifications , and especially new vector bundle constructions which are helpful in order to derive the spectrum and the particle content of the mssm . in section three type iia intersecting d - brane models will be reviewed .",
    "we will address the statistical properties of these models , i.e. we discuss the question , how many consistent d6-brane embeddings on a given closed string background exist in total , and what is the fraction of them that come close the mssm .",
    "next we will consider the problem of moduli stabilization and also of supersymmetry breaking by adding background fluxes and taking into account effects from non - perturbative string instantons . finally , in section four",
    ", we will discuss some aspects about the relation between flux vacua and black hole entropies , and the related problem how to formulate for flux compactificatons a wave function in moduli space .",
    "in ten dimensions there exist two heterotic strings models with @xmath16 supersymmetry ( 16 supercharges ) and gauge groups , @xmath17 .",
    "compactifications of the heterotic string that preserves @xmath16 supersymmetry in four dimensions ( 4 supercharges ) are built following essentially two steps :    * a suitable choice of an internal , six dimensional manifold @xmath18 , which can be a calabi - yau ( cy ) manifold , a supersymmetric orbifold , or , in more complicated cases with background fluxes , a space with @xmath19 group structure .",
    "we will focus on calabi - yau compactifications . * a suitable choice of a stable vector bundle @xmath20 with structure group @xmath21 over @xmath18 . in",
    "order to preserve space - time supersymmetry , @xmath20 must be holomorphic , its fields strength has to satisfy @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the inverse metric of the complex space @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore one has to demand the absence of tadpoles , i.e. @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being the ns 3-form field strength .",
    "this implies the vanishing of the second chern class of @xmath20 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the second chern class of the tangent bundle of the cy - manifold .",
    "the observed gauge group @xmath28 in four dimensions is given by the commutant of @xmath21 in @xmath29 : @xmath30 finally , the number of chiral , massless matter fields ( in a given representation of @xmath28  see later for more details ) is determined by the third chern number of @xmath20 : @xmath31    now there exists essentially two classes of heterotic bundle constructions in the literature :    0.3 cm _ ( i ) @xmath21 being a simple lie - group : _",
    "0.3 cm these bundles were explicitly constructed by a number of groups , @xcite where most of the explicit constructions use as a cy base space an elliptically fibred calabi - yau manifold .",
    "since @xmath21 is simple , the four - dimensional gauge group is simple , too .",
    "hence this construction is very suitable for construction gut models in four dimensions .",
    "e.g. : @xmath32 it is a generic feature of these vector bundles , that the four - dimensional spectrum does not contain higgs fields in the adjoint representation of @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , in order to further break these gut groups to the gauge group of the sm , one needs additional discrete wilson lines .",
    "in fact , following this method , three generation models without exotic particles can be constructed .    0.3 cm _ ( ii ) @xmath21 being a non - simple lie - group : _    0.3 cm here , the structure group @xmath21 contains at least one abelian @xmath33 factor , i.e. it is of the form : @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "it follows that also @xmath28 contains the same @xmath33 gauge factor : @xmath35 of course , this feature is required , if one likes to construct heterotic cy compacatifications , which directly lead to the sm gauge group , or other models with @xmath33 factors , like flipped @xmath36 gut s with gauge group @xmath37 .",
    "explicit models can be again constructed on elliptically fibred cy - spaces .",
    "a detailed analysis of the topology of these vector bundles reveals the following interesting relation between the euler numbers @xmath38 of @xmath20 and the number of sm particle representations in four dimensions @xcite :    .massless spectrum of @xmath39 models with @xmath40 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.6 cm as can be seen from this table , the black hole entropy corresponds to the negative value of the @xmath41 cosmological constant in the flux landscape .",
    "hence one obtains for the wave function @xmath42 the following relation : @xmath43 this form of the wave function is very similar to the hartle - hawking wave function , which describes certain tunneling amplitudes between different vacua .",
    "it implies that @xmath41 vacua with minimal cosmological constant possess the largest probability .",
    "the principle of entropy maximization was further studied in @xcite . as a simple toy example the entropy functional near the special point in calabi - yau compactifications , where new states become massless ( conifold point ) , was studied . in particular , the following question was addressed , namely is the entropy functional maximal resp .",
    "minimal in case @xmath44 vector / hyper multiplets become massless at this special point ? for massless hypermultiplets ,",
    "the effective gauge theory at the conifold is infrared free ( negative @xmath45-function coefficient , i.e. @xmath46 , and for massless vector multiplets the effective gauge theory is asymptotically free , i.e. @xmath47 .    the answer to the question above is the following . using the known expression for the @xmath44 prepotential near the conifold point , the entropy functional takes the following form @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the complex structure modulus , which describes the moduli space in the neighborhood of the conifold point . from this formula",
    "it follows that the entropy is maximal at @xmath50 for @xmath46 and minimal for @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "hence , according to this discussion the effective , infrared free gauge theory is more probable than the asymptotically free gauge theory .",
    "this conclusion also persists , if one includes higher curvature corrections in the entropy functional , or if one uses the non - perturbative prepotential from topological string theory @xcite .    in @xcite the entropy functional of non - supersymmetric ,",
    "charged black holes around the conifold point was studied .",
    "in turns out that in this case the conifold point is not anymore an attractor point .",
    "however one can show that there exist an attractor point in the close neighborhood of the conifold point .",
    "finally let us end with some comments on a probability functional of 4-dimensional @xmath51 flux vacua .",
    "supersymmetric @xmath51 vacua with all moduli fixed can be constructed in type iia flux compactifications with 0,2,4,6-form ramond fluxes plus possibly geometrical fluxes @xcite , and also in type iib on some non - geometrical background spaces with 3-form fluxes @xcite . in the next step one",
    "replaces the various fluxes by their corresponding smeared brane sources @xcite .",
    "these branes are wrapping internal cycles , and they are domain walls in the four - dimensional space time , like d4-branes wrapped around internal 2-cycles , d8-branes wrapped around the cy - space or ns5-branes wrapped around internal 3-cycles .",
    "as one can show @xcite , these brane configurations are supersymmetric , create the same tadpoles as the fluxes , and in 4d their interpolate between the near horizon geometry @xmath51 and flat minkowski space - time .",
    "so having constructed these supersymmetric brane configurations that correspond to @xmath51 flux vacua , one might hope to determine thei entropies of these 4d domain walls and to get in this way a probability functional in the four - dimensional flux landscape .",
    "in this talk we addressed the question how to relate the string theory landscape with low energy physics , in particular with the mssm .",
    "phenomenologically interesting heterotic constructions and d - brane models were discussed . in particular starting from a large sample of consistent d - brane embeddings into a given 6-dimensional internal space , we investigated the statistical likelihood of obtaining models which come to the mssm . in additions",
    ", some mechanisms for moduli stabilization were investigated , where we also addressed the question whether these mechanisms can be successfully be realized in concrete orientifold compactifications .",
    "one caveat in this discussion is that the moduli stabilization occurs within the effective supergravity approach which is limited to large volumes of the internal spaces",
    ". it would be interesting to learn more about the string landscape taking into account higher order @xmath52 corrections , or investigating the problem of the string ground state in a background independent formulation . finally",
    ", some ideas about probability functions in the string moduli space in relation with black hole entropies were presented .",
    "this apparently works for two - dimensional @xmath41 flux vacua , which are related to 4d charged black hole solutions .",
    "whether a similar constructions also works for 4-dimensional @xmath51 flux vacua , which can be related to 4d domain wall solutions , still has to be seen in the future .",
    "for the string landscape discussion it is also important to learn what kind of field theory are inside the string landscape and can be consistently coupled to gravity , and which field theories lie outside the string landscape , the socalled swampland @xcite .    during the next years",
    ", we hope to get a lot of new informations for string model building from new experiments , most notable the lhc and new astrophysical observations",
    ". it will be very important to concretely work out the chain between the experimental data and the string theory parameters , which are to large extent given in terms of geometrical and topological parameters of the internal compact spaces . at the moment string theory",
    "still does not make too many very explicit predictions about soft supersymmetry breaking masses etc .",
    "however there are important qualitative predictions from string theory .",
    "in particular we are interested in the answer to the following questions :    * where is the intrinsic string scale @xmath2 ? * what is the size of the extra dimenensions ? * what is the scale of supersymmetry breaking ?    to answer these questions",
    "is indeed a great challenge for the next years ; to make progress in our understanding about string theory or more generally about physics at very short distances needs big combined efforts of mathematicians , string theorists , particle phenomenologists , astrophysicists and last but not least of experimentalists .",
