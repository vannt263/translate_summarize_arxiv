    "radiative feedback from quasars to surroundings of their hosts has been realized for many years .",
    "several effects have been suggested , including the compton heating ( begelman 1985 ; chang et al .",
    "1987 ; wang et al . 2005 ) , acoustic wave heating ( chelouche 2007 ) , proximity effects ( bajtlik et al .",
    "1988 ; goncalves et al . 2008 ; wild et al . 2008 ; prochaska & hennawi 2008 ) .",
    "the strong feedback due to radiation may quench the inflows fueling the central black hole ( e.g. binney & tabor 1995 ) and star formation so as to arise the relation between black hole masses and dispersion velocities ( silk & rees 1998 ; king 2003 ; ciotti & ostriker 2007 ; fabian et al .",
    "however , the direct large scale evidence for feedback is scarce , and even absent in most cases .    traditionally quasars are selected based on their bluer color ,",
    "however , the existence of significant population of red quasars has been the subject of debate for a number of years .",
    "the percentage of red quasars is only @xmath2 or so from the large database of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( richards et al .",
    "2003 ) , @xmath3 in the first-2mass red quasar survey ( glikman et al .",
    "2007 ) , and @xmath3 in _ spitzer _ survey ( brown et al . 2006",
    "; lacy et al .",
    "the fraction of red quasars remains a big debate , however this might be due to heterogeneous definition or selection effects of surveys .",
    "there is increasing evidence for dust extinction as one of the major explanations for red quasars from sdss ( richards et al .",
    "2003 ) , _ galex _ data ( trammell et al . 2007 ) , _ spitzer _ survey ( brown et al . 2006 ; lacy et al .",
    "2007 ) and _ hst _ images ( urrutia et al . 2008 ) as well as from numerical simulations ( di matteo et al . 2005 ; hopkins et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the debris , ejected from mergers or starburst triggering the central black holes , surrounds the nucleus prior to the galactic winds ( sanders et al .",
    "1989 ; yun et al . 2004 ; fabian et al .",
    "2006 and hopkins et al .",
    "2007 ) , reddening quasars .",
    "the well - known roles of dust particles in outflows , as results of strong coupling between the charged grains with gas ( e.g. draine & salpeter 1979 ) , have been realized in the dynamics of dusty gas ( chang et al .",
    "1987 ; murray et al . 2005 ; fabian et al .",
    "it is then expected that the swept medium by quasar radiation results in extinction of quasars .",
    "the present letter makes an attempt to connect the action of the radiative feedback to the phenomena of red quasars and predicts some observational features .",
    "we argue that radiation from quasar is partly converted to kinetic luminosity of supersonic outflowing gas and then partly tansformed to the kinetic energy of accelerated electrons via fermi mechanism , producing extended fuzz with non - thermal emission from radio to @xmath4rays around red quasars .",
    "dusty winds in homogeneous medium have been discussed in the literatures ( chang et al .",
    "1988 ; murray et al . 2005 ; fabian et al . 2006 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the gas in dark matter halos is driven into two phases in temperatures by the thermal instability ( fall & rees 1985 ) , especially in the presence of radiation heating of quasars .",
    "thermal states of the medium are not the main goals of this letter , but we will discuss two cases of the medium : 1 ) homogeneous interstellar medium ( ism ) and 2 ) clumpy ism , respectively .",
    "observational appearance of the extended fuzz is quite similar for two cases unless the high spatial resolution of radio telescopes could resolve the cold clouds .",
    "for an isothermal sphere of gas with density profile as @xmath5 , murray et al .",

    "( 26 ) in murray et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , where @xmath6 is the radius of the expanding winds , @xmath8pc is the initial radius of the winds ( fabian et al .",

    "here we only consider graphite grains here and assume they are sphere with a radius @xmath14 .",
    "we assume the ism has the same gas - to - dust ratio with the galaxy .",
    "since the charged particles of dust are strongly coupled with the ionized atoms via coulomb interaction ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) , the dusty gas feels a stronger radiation pressure , amplified by a factor of @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mean cross section per hydrogen atom for uv photons in the presence of dust ( martin & ferland 1980 ; chang et al .",
    "1988 ; fabian et al . 2006 ) and @xmath17 .",
    "the factor @xmath18 has been discussed for various cases in detail by fabian et al .",

    "( 1 ) should be replaced by @xmath19 . for a quasar with a bolometric luminosity @xmath20 ,",
    "the uv luminosity is approximate to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ( marconi et al . 2004 ) and @xmath23 is the eddington ratio .",

    "( 1 ) , we have the maximum velocity of the expansion @xmath25 at the radius @xmath26 and the mach number is @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 cm  s@xmath11 is the sound speed and @xmath31k . here",
    "we assume warm winds with a temperature of @xmath32k .",
    "the supersonic winds form shocks inevitably and the strongest shocks are at @xmath33kpc .",
    "it should be noted that the velocity from eq .",
    "( 1 ) is insensitive to the radius after @xmath34 , implying that strong shocks still extend further .",
    "chang et al . ( 1987 ) showed that shocks appear in both one- and two - dimension flow by detailed dynamical calculations , which agrees with the present simple estimation . as a result of",
    "so strong shocks , electrons will be accelerated by the first order fermi process ( blandford & eichler 1987 ) .",
    "given the extinction coefficient @xmath35 , the fraction of radiation absorbed by the dusty gas is @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that the absorbed energies are converted into the kinetic luminosity of the winds @xmath37 , where @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the processing efficiency .",
    "the total energy channeled into relativistic electrons is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the acceleration efficiency converting the kinetic energy into the electrons .",
    "though the detailed process of the acceleration is still insufficiently understood , it is generally taken as @xmath43 ( blandford & eichler 1987 ) .",
    "we then have the non - thermal luminosity from the electrons @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the spectrum emitted from the electrons will be given in  3 .",
    "the physics of the infalling gas has been extensively discussed stemming from fall & rees ( 1985 ) .",
    "the basic constraints on the medium are from the gravitational collapse and thermal conduction between the hot and cold phases ( fall & rees 1985 ; mo & miralda - escude 1996 ) .",
    "the typical temperature and density of the hot gas are of @xmath46k and @xmath47@xmath48 in elliptical galaxies , respectively ( mathews & brighenti 2003 ) .",
    "the lower limit of cold clouds is given by @xmath49 due to thermal conduction , otherwise they will be evaporated ( fall & rees 1985 ) , whereas the clouds will collapse into smaller ones if they are too massive ( e.g @xmath50 ) .",
    "we assume the clouds are sphere with radius @xmath51 and mass @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) . a pressure balance @xmath54 holds between the clouds and their surroundings .",
    "the geometric covering factor can be defined as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the solid angle of an individual cloud and @xmath57 is the total number of the cold clouds .",
    "this covering factor is the same with the probability that a quasar is a red one .",
    "here we assume that _ all _ the clouds are identical with same size , shape and physical conditions .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the clouds are sphere . if the radius of the clouds is @xmath51 and @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 , where @xmath6 is the distance of the clouds to the galactic center . the number of the clouds is then estimated from eq . ( 7 ) if the geometric covering factor is estimated from the percentage of red quasars",
    ". the individual cloud should not be too dense , otherwise the red quasars become type 2s .",
    "this constraint can be set up by the column density @xmath60 through the extinction coefficient @xmath35 .",

( 8 - 9 ) as the typical values for @xmath69 and @xmath70 since they are not very sensitive to @xmath68 .",
    "the mach number of the dusty winds in the clouds is @xmath71 where @xmath72k .",
    "the mach number is stronger than the homogeneous ism since the temperature is lower in the clouds .",
    "the shocked clouds produce relativistic electrons .",
    "when a cloud is just on the line of an observer s sight , the quasar appears as one red quasar .",
    "the transparent luminosity through the clouds is given by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the intrinsic luminosity of the quasar , while the unabsorbed luminosity is given by @xmath76 .",
    "the global energy budget is then given by @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 and @xmath79 means the fraction of the intrinsic luminosity converted into the kinetic energy of the winds .",
    "the kinetic luminosity of the winds is then given by @xmath80 .",
    "the total non - thermal luminosity from the relativistic electrons is given by @xmath81 eq.(1 ) is still valid for the clumpy ism ( murray et al .",
    "2005 ) , but the shocks are produced mainly on the cold clouds .",
    "some electrons will be energized to be relativistic through fermi shock acceleration .",
    "the maximum energy of the relativistic electrons is determined by the energy gain and loss . here",
    "we focus on the non - thermal radiation from the relativistic electron , rather than the detail of acceleration process . in this letter",
    ", we assume the synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scatter are two main non - thermal radiation processes .",
    "since the magnetic field is poorly understood in such a context , we assume an equipartition between the tangled magnetic field and the gas , then the energy density of the magnetic field @xmath82ergs  @xmath48 and @xmath83 g , where @xmath84 . there are three sources of the seed photons of compton scattering : 1 ) from the nuclear of quasars ; 2 ) the reprocessed photons by the clouds ; 3 ) synchrotron photons and 4 ) from the host galaxies .",
    "however , light from hosts can be neglected for quasars bright enough .",
    "the second could be neglected since they are only @xmath85 of the first source ( if the optical depth @xmath86 for @xmath87 , but may be important for the very red quasars or redden quasars ) .",
    "the energy loss is mainly due to synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering of the seed photons from quasar s nuclear .",
    "the energy density of quasar s radiation is given by @xmath88 at @xmath6 from the center , where @xmath89 and @xmath90ergs  s@xmath11 .",
    "we find that @xmath91 , indicating that the energy loss is mainly due to external inverse compton scattering provided by the red quasars .",
    "the synchrotron self - compton scattering can be neglected in such a context . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume the quasar spectrum is characterized by a black body with a temperature of @xmath92k from the standard accretion disk ( inoue & takahara 1996 ) .",
    "the timescale of energy loss due to the inverse compton scattering is @xmath93 sec , where @xmath94 , whereas the acceleration time scale is @xmath95 ( blandford & eichler 1987 ) , where @xmath96 is the lamore radius , and @xmath97 cm",
    "s@xmath11 is the shock velocity .",
    "the maximum lorentz factor of the electrons is given by @xmath98 , @xmath99 where @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",

    "we assume a simple power law of the electrons as @xmath109 in a range of @xmath110 via the first order fermi acceleration , where @xmath111 is the minimum lorentz factor . we treat @xmath111 as a free parameter in this paper .",
    "@xmath112 is determined by eqs .",
    "( 6 ) or ( 11 ) . for a red quasar containing a black hole with @xmath113",
    ", we plot the multiwavelength continuum of the fuzz for three different @xmath114 in fig 1 .",
    "it should be noted that the difference between @xmath115 and the spectrum in fig . 1 is due to the inclusion of the klein - nishina effects in the later .",
    "some uncertainties of the proposed model should be noted , which are most likely because of the dependence of the factor @xmath116 on the thermal state of the medium as shown in fabian et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . here",
    "we use the maximum @xmath116 .",
    "the @xmath117 , depending on the shock velocity , could be lowered when @xmath116 decreases , leading to the synchrotron peak shifts to long wavelength as well as the inverse compton peak .",
    "we use a magnetic field in an equipartition with thermal energy of medium , but it can not be deviated from the equipartition too much .",
    "the isothermal sphere under the galactic potential gives the density @xmath118 , we have the column density of the gas exterior to @xmath119 , @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the gas fraction ( fabian et al .",
    "this leads to an extinction coefficient @xmath122 , appearing as a red quasar , where @xmath123 and @xmath124 is the gas - to - dust ratio ( gorenstein 1975 ) .",
    "we note that the sweeping timescale of the radiation - driven winds is @xmath125 yr .",
    "the lifetime of quasars @xmath126 is about the salpeter time @xmath127 yr ( @xmath128 is the radiative efficiency ) , we have the percentage of red quasars at a level of @xmath129 .",
    "this roughly agrees with the results from sdss ( richards et al .",
    "2003 ) .    0.2 cm [ fig1 ] 0.5 cm    table 1 .",
    "detection of the multiwavelength fuzz    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     0.1 cm    the targets for searching the fuzz can be found from those low redshift red quasars from first-2mass , _ spitzer _ and sloan samples .",
    "table 1 gives the future detections of the fuzz through multiwavelength telescopes .",
    "the predicted fuzz has a level of synchrotron power of @xmath130ergs  s@xmath11 , which is easily to be detected by radio telescopes .",
    "ir band telescopes are obviously capable of imaging the fuzz , in particular , the alma and jwst are able to detect the fuzz at @xmath131 in future",
    ". the fuzz could be marginally detected by the existing _ hess _ and _ veritas _ , but it is worth making an attempt .",
    "_ glast _ is anticipated to explore fuzz more feasibly .",
    "we have to note that tev emission from fuzz could be diluted via @xmath132 interaction by the cosmic ir back ground photons beyond redshift @xmath133 .",
    "so it is not expected for @xmath4ray telescopes to detect the tev emission from fuzz for red quasars with @xmath131 .",
    "if the episodic activity of supermassive black holes is really caused by a series of mergers of galaxies ( marconi et al .",
    "2004 ; di matteo et al .",
    "2005 ; wang et al . 2006 ; 2008 ) , there is no doubt that the detection of the fuzz will provide the most powerful diagnostic to evolutionary chains of galaxies and quasars from details of the radiative feedback .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that x - ray emission from fuzz is extremely faint unless the maximum lorentz factor is lowered by a factor of 10 .",
    "this could be plausible if the factor @xmath116 decreases by a factor of 10 .",
    "in such a context , the fuzz is able to produce hard x - rays detected by the _ nustar _ ( the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array ) .",
    "in this letter , we show that the enhanced radiation pressure inevitably leads to strong shocks in the dusty gas of both homogeneous and clumpy ism . the first fermi shock acceleration results in production of relativistic electrons in the shocked ism , from which produces non - thermal emission via synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering , displaying multiwavelength fuzz from radio , infrared and @xmath4ray bands .",
    "the current radio telescopes , mips , hess and veritas are capable of detecting the fuzz . the multiwavelength image of the fuzz provides an interesting and new clue to understand the interaction between quasars and their environments .",
    "the predicted @xmath4ray emission from fuzz could have significant contribution to cosmic @xmath4ray background if _ all _ quasars have to undergo such a red phase during their cosmic evolution .",
