    "entanglement lies at the heart of many quantum information processing protocols @xcite . in order to generate entangled states",
    "one typically envisages a process that in the ideal case would lead to the desired state with the desired amount of entanglement .",
    "imperfections such as noise and losses , however , degrade the quality of the state and diminish the amount of entanglement created . as a consequence",
    ", the task for which the entangled state is created ( say , teleportation @xcite ) will be accomplished only partially .",
    "an alternative strategy for generating a certain amount of entanglement would be the following : use a process that in the ideal case would generate ( much ) more entanglement than needed , but that produces the desired amount in the realistic imperfect case .",
    "if it were increasingly difficult to generate larger amounts of entanglement , that strategy would not be very useful .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that for light beams a standard optical nonlinearity allows one to generate _ more _ entanglement when the interaction time ( or length ) @xmath3 is _ shorter _ : one generates @xmath4 ebits in a time @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this effect exploits some of the peculiar properties of entanglement in infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces @xcite .",
    "we may use that effect in the following way : take a very short time ( or length ) @xmath5 to generate a bipartite @xmath6 dimensional pure state of two modes with @xmath4 ebits of entanglement , with @xmath7 large .",
    "since the interaction time is assumed short we may neglect decoherence during that part of the procedure and consequently the state at that point is still pure . by the time we will actually use the state for some quantum - information processing protocol ,",
    "there will have been decoherence , turning the pure state into a mixed state @xmath8 .",
    "the most relevant type of decoherence for light beams is that due to photon absorption losses , and that is the only type of decoherence we will consider here .",
    "we are interested in the amount of bipartite entanglement between the two modes @xcite in the state @xmath8 .",
    "since @xmath8 will typically still be a very high - dimensional state , we use a measure of entanglement that can actually be computed efficiently even in that case : the logarithmic negativity @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "that quantity can be linked to two operational measures of entanglement , demonstrating the possible use of the mixed - state entanglement in @xmath8 . on the one hand @xmath9",
    "determines a bound ( through the negativity in fact ) on the fidelity that can be achieved in teleportation using a single copy of @xmath8 , on the other it gives a bound on the amount of distillable ( pure - state ) @xcite entanglement present in many copies of @xmath8 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    an alternative method to create certain desired entangled states of light",
    "was discussed in @xcite : that method is very similar in spirit to that analyzed here but still relies on producing a pure state .",
    "the first part of the procedure is the same as above and consists of generating an @xmath6-dimensional pure entangled state ( with @xmath7 large ) of two modes . but subsequently one performs appropriate local measurements on both modes to ( approximately and probabilistically ) project the state down to a @xmath10-dimensional state of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a coherent state , and where the amplitude @xmath13 is not too small , such that @xmath12 and @xmath14 are to a very good approximation orthogonal . in that case , the states ( [ ecs ] ) possess one ebit of entanglement for any value of the phase @xmath15 and such states can then be used for teleportation @xcite , quantum computing @xcite , quantum communication @xcite , and testing nonlocality @xcite .    generally speaking , the sensitivity to noise increases with the number of photons in the state .",
    "this was noted , in particular , in experiments on generating schrdinger cat states of the form @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "it is also true for the related entangled coherent states @xcite , and this issue was subsequently investigated in more detail and generality for light beams in @xcite . for an even more general discussion of decoherence of macroscopic and microscopic objects ,",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "thus , while increasing @xmath7 leads to more entanglement it also leads to the state being more sensitive to decoherence , as the number of photons needed to create that much entanglement increases as @xmath17 .",
    "that is , one expects the state to lose entanglement at a rate that increases with @xmath7 .",
    "thus , one may expect an optimum number of photons for fixed interaction time and fixed amount of decoherence to exist that maximizes the amount of entanglement left after decoherence .",
    "confirming that expectation is another aim of this paper .",
    "we first review some of the results of @xcite that we need here .",
    "suppose one starts out with a coherent state @xmath18 and one lets the state propagate through a kerr nonlinear medium , described by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath19 for a time @xmath3 equal to @xmath20 , with @xmath7 an integer .",
    "subsequently one splits the resulting state on a 50/50 beamsplitter with the vacuum .",
    "the state of the two output modes so generated is of the form @xmath21 where the states @xmath22 are coherent states with amplitude @xmath13 and phases @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) and may be called multi - dimensional entangled coherent states . for ease of notation , here and in the following",
    "we suppress the dependence of the states @xmath22 and similar states defined below on the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath7 . up to irrelevant overall phase factors the coefficients @xmath25 are given by @xmath26 the states ( [ m ] ) potentially possess @xmath4 ebits of entanglement , namely when @xmath13 is sufficiently large to make the states @xmath27 and @xmath28 nearly orthogonal for @xmath29 .",
    "this requires that @xmath30 be at least of order @xmath17 .",
    "more precisely , if we choose a small number @xmath31 the requirement @xmath32 gives latexmath:[\\[\\label{d }    @xmath7 .",
    "this follows from the expression for the overlap of two coherent states with complex amplitudes @xmath13 and @xmath34 latexmath:[\\[\\langle\\alpha|\\beta\\rangle=\\exp(\\alpha^*\\beta-|\\alpha|^2/2-    @xmath5 , the more entanglement the states ( [ m ] ) contain , provided the number of photons is sufficiently large .",
    "the decoherence of a mode due to photon absorption losses can be described by a parameter @xmath36 that gives the fraction of photons surviving the absorption process .",
    "the loss process is determined by its effect on coherent states by latexmath:[\\[|\\alpha\\rangle\\otimes|0\\rangle_e\\rightarrow    @xmath0 refers to the environment , which will be traced out .",
    "we have a bipartite state on two modes , and when we assume both modes to decohere in the same way , the pure state @xmath38 is turned into a mixture of the form @xmath39 here we defined two new states , related to those defined in ( [ phi ] ) .",
    "first , due to decoherence the amplitude @xmath13 is reduced by a factor of @xmath36 , and hence we used the states latexmath:[\\[\\label{phit }    expand @xmath8 in .",
    "second , the state of the environment can be expanded , likewise , in terms of the states latexmath:[\\[\\label{phie }    tracing out the environment the overlaps of such states appear in the expression for @xmath8 , hence the appearance of the factor @xmath42 in ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "in order to determine the entanglement in the state @xmath8 as a function of @xmath43 , we use , as announced , the logarithmic negativity as measure of entanglement @xcite .",
    "we first have to express the density matrix in some orthogonal basis .",
    "this can be accomplished as follows : first define the @xmath7-by-@xmath7 gram matrix @xmath44 by its entries @xmath45 then suppose we have chosen @xmath7 orthogonal states @xmath46 for @xmath47 in terms of which we expand @xmath48 similarly , we expand the density matrix @xmath8 in terms of the basis formed by the set @xmath49 can be expressed in terms of the gram matrix by using the relation @xmath50 namely , in brief notation , we have @xmath51 with the superscript @xmath52 denoting the transpose . here",
    "we used the fact that @xmath44 is a hermitian matrix with positive eigenvalues , so that @xmath53 , too , can be chosen as a hermitian matrix with positive eigenvalues . defining a matrix @xmath54 by its elements @xmath55",
    "we can write the density matrix @xmath8 as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the matrix defined by @xmath58 the partial transpose of @xmath8 with respect to the first mode and with respect to the basis ( [ x ] ) is denoted by @xmath59 and is defined through @xmath60 the logarithmic negativity of @xmath8 , finally , is given by @xmath61 with @xmath62 denoting the trace norm , which for hermitian operators is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues .",
    "the result ( [ exact ] ) is exact and can be calculated numerically in a straightforward way by using standard linear algebra . on the other hand ,",
    "the size of the matrix @xmath8 may become too large for large @xmath7 to be useful in numerical computations .",
    "here we use matlab , and whenever @xmath63 we use the exact result ( [ exact ] ) .",
    "in other cases we can use certain approximations valid under the appropriate conditions .      in the case that the states @xmath64 are almost orthogonal , we can approximate @xmath65 as follows .",
    "first , the partial transpose of @xmath8 is approximated by @xmath66 then the @xmath17 eigenvalues of this matrix can be written as @xmath67 hence @xmath68,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 we can further approximate this when @xmath70 is a small number , @xmath71 .",
    "in fact , when not only @xmath72 is small but @xmath73 is small as well , we can simply expand the exponentials appearing in the expression for @xmath74 to obtain @xmath75\\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx & \\log_2 m- \\epsilon|\\alpha|^2 \\frac{2}{\\log(2)}\\frac{m-1}{m}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath72 becomes larger , such that @xmath73 is no longer small , we can make a different approximation in the case that relation ( [ d ] ) holds with @xmath31 some fixed small number . in this case , @xmath74 can be rewritten as @xmath76 this sum can not be performed analytically , but we can approximate it as @xmath77 which is valid for @xmath72 not too small . since @xmath31 only terms with sufficiently small values of @xmath78 contribute . in particular ,",
    "if we simply cut off the summation when @xmath79 becomes smaller than some number @xmath80 , i.e. , at @xmath81 , then the entanglement @xmath9 is of the form @xmath82.\\ ] ] we checked this approximation numerically and @xmath83 was determined to be around @xmath84 .",
    "here we use the exact result ( [ exact ] ) and the approximate results ( [ en1 ] ) , ( [ approx1 ] ) , and ( [ d ] ) to investigate the behavior of entanglement as functions of various different parameters .    when @xmath13 is sufficiently large and @xmath85 one will have @xmath4 ebits of entanglement . but how quickly does one lose that possibly large amount of entanglement when there is a small amount of decoherence ? the average number of photons absorbed from each mode is @xmath86 the change in entanglement from pure to mixed state , @xmath87 is , for _ very _ small losses , proportional to @xmath88 and is given by @xmath89 ebits per photon : @xmath90 where we used ( [ approx1 ] ) .",
    "this shows how fragile the initial pure entangled states are when they contain a large number of photons .",
    "even when a tiny fraction @xmath72 of photons is lost , the number of photons lost may still be appreciable if @xmath30 is large , and this may lead to a large degradation of entanglement .    when @xmath72 increases the entanglement loss per photon decreases",
    ". using ( [ en1 ] ) [ since we assume @xmath73 is not small we can not use ( [ approx1 ] ) ; we do assume @xmath31 now ] we plot @xmath91 as a function of @xmath92 in fig .  1 .     as a function of @xmath92 .",
    "two curves on the right correspond to @xmath93 , the two on the left to @xmath94 .",

    "this plot uses the approximation ( [ en1 ] ) . ]    the 4 curves plotted in fig .",
    "1 are shifted versions of one another : in fact , they are really only functions of @xmath97 .",
    "the approximation ( [ d ] ) , too , depends only on @xmath88 , not on @xmath98 or @xmath72 separately .",
    "in addition the change in entanglement @xmath99 does not depend on @xmath7 either since both @xmath9 and @xmath100 depend on @xmath7 in the same way . to verify this behavior and to see whether this behavior extends to parameter regimes",

    "there are in fact 5 curves here , several of which overlap to make them indistinguishable .",
    "the dashed curve is for @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the solid , almost overlapping curves , are for @xmath103 and @xmath101 , and for @xmath96 with @xmath101 , 200 , and 2000 . ]",
    "the plot confirms the predicted behavior : for @xmath98 not too large the change in entanglement is only a function of @xmath88 , but not of @xmath7 , or @xmath72 or @xmath98 independently . for @xmath102 ( and @xmath101 )",
    "there is only a small deviation from that universal behavior .",
    "fig .  3 plots , in contrast , not the change in entanglement but the entanglement @xmath9 left after decoherence .",
    "the parameter regime considered is very different as @xmath72 is no longer assumed very small .",
    "we do assume @xmath31 so that we can use the approximation ( [ en1 ] ) .",
    "from the approximation ( [ d ] ) to that approximation we see that @xmath9 no longer depends on @xmath7 , provided @xmath7 is not too small .",
    "that behavior , too , is confirmed in fig .  3 , where curves for @xmath101 ( recall that whenever @xmath63 the exact result ( [ exact ] ) is used ) are seen to overlap with one for @xmath104 .",
    "as a function of @xmath105 .",
    "there are two solid curves almost completely overlapping that correspond to @xmath101 and @xmath106 , demonstrating that the amount of entanglement left after decoherence is insensitive to @xmath7 when @xmath7 is not too small .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to @xmath107 , the circles to @xmath108 , the diamonds to @xmath109 . ]    for smaller values of @xmath7 there is a clear dependence on @xmath7 , as is illustrated for @xmath110 . from fig .",
    "3 one notices that at reasonable ( i.e. realistic ) values of @xmath72 the amount of entanglement left is less than one unit , even if we started out with a state with @xmath111 for @xmath104 .",
    "however , that result is not optimized for the number of photons",
    "@xmath30 in the initial state .",
    "in particular , since we chose @xmath98 to be small , @xmath30 is roughly equal to @xmath17 .    in order to see whether smaller numbers of photons may leave more entanglement after decoherence ( since one expects the decoherence to have a less strong influence when there are fewer photons even if the initial pure state does not quite have the full @xmath4 ebits of entanglement ) , we plot in fig .",
    "4 @xmath9 as a function of @xmath30 for various values of @xmath7 .     as a function of @xmath30",
    "there are three pairs of curves , each pair consisting of a solid curve , correpsonding to @xmath112 , and a dashed curve ( for @xmath113 ) .",
    "the three pairs correspond to @xmath101 , 30 , and 40 , with the maxima of the curves with larger @xmath7 moving to larger @xmath30 . ]    here we can not use the approximation ( [ en1 ] ) and hence use the exact calculation , which , as mentioned before , does restrict the calculation to @xmath63 .",
    "the plot shows that the optimum amount of entanglement remaining after decoherence is almost independent of the value of @xmath7 , thus confirming the findings from fig .",
    "3 . for example , for @xmath112 one",
    "is left with about 0.92 ebits of entanglement for the optimum values of @xmath30 almost irrespective of how much entanglement the initial pure state had .",
    "on the other hand , there is a strong dependence on @xmath30 .",
    "finally , the plot also shows that the decohered states become more robust against photon absorption losses . for , even if one started out with a very large amount of ( pure - state ) entanglement , losing 30% of the photons ( @xmath112 ) leaves one with at best around 0.9 ebits of entanglement . but",
    "a further loss of 30% ( so that @xmath113 ) of the photons merely decreases the entanglement by a factor of 2 .    in fig .",
    "5 we plot the same function but for smaller values of @xmath7 .",
    "as it turns out , if one fixes @xmath112 the largest amount of entanglement one can be left with , starting out with multi - dimensional entangled coherent states , is in fact @xmath114 achieved by taking @xmath115 and @xmath116 .     as a function of @xmath30 for @xmath112 and @xmath117 , where the maxima of the curves move to larger values of @xmath30 for larger @xmath7 . ]",
    "we considered the decoherence of multi - dimensional entangled coherent states due to photon absorption losses .",
    "those states are bipartite entangled states of two modes , and are described by two independent parameters .",
    "one is @xmath13 , such that @xmath30 gives the average number of photons in each mode .",
    "the other is @xmath7 , an integer indicating the maximum possible amount of entanglement between the two modes , @xmath4 .",
    "the amount of photon absorption is governed by an additional parameter , @xmath72 , the fraction of photons absorbed from each mode .",
    "we calculated the amount of entanglement left after decoherence as a function of @xmath13 , @xmath72 , and @xmath7 .",
    "one useful quantity that can be constructed from the above parameters is @xmath97 , the number of photons absorbed from each mode .",
    "another useful quantity is @xmath98 defined as @xmath118 , which determines the overlap between two coherent states of amplitude @xmath13 and phase difference @xmath119 . in terms of those quantities the conclusions are    1 .   for large @xmath7",
    "the entanglement disappears at a rate given by @xmath2 ebits per photon as long as @xmath120 .",
    "2 .   for large @xmath7 , small @xmath98 and not too large values of @xmath88",
    "the change in entanglement is a function of @xmath88 alone .",
    "3 .   for large @xmath7 and @xmath88 , and for small @xmath98",
    "it is the remaining amount of entanglement that is a function of @xmath88 alone .",
    "4 .   in general there is an optimum number of photons @xmath30 for fixed @xmath72 and @xmath7 that maximizes the amount of entanglement left after decoherence . for that optimum",
    ", @xmath98 is not very small ( around 0.2 ) .    as an example of point 4",
    ", we found that almost one ebit of entanglement can be obtained with 30% photon absorption by using a little less than 3 photons per mode for the initial pure state and @xmath115 .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath98 is about 0.19 . that is the maximum amount possible , but",
    "almost the same amount of entanglement ( at least 95% of the optimum ) can be obtained by using almost any value of @xmath7 and the appropriate value for @xmath121 .",
