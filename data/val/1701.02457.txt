    "polyelectrolyte brushes consist of polyelectrolyte chains grafted to a planar or curved surface  @xcite .",
    "the overall structure of such a system is mainly determined by the osmotic pressure of the counterions . in the osmotic limit , that is , at low salt concentrations ,",
    "the chains are strongly stretched whereas in the salted brush generated by high salt concentrations the electrostatic interaction is strongly screened and the resulting spatial structure of the brush layer resembles the case of uncharged brushes  @xcite . in this way polyelectrolyte brushes present adaptive systems that have been discussed for a broad variety of applications  @xcite .",
    "some 10 years ago it has been found that polyelectrolyte brushes strongly adsorb proteins with like net charge in the osmotic limits , while virtually no interaction took place in the limit of the salted brush  @xcite .",
    "thus , a spherical polyelectrolyte brush consisting of a solid core of approximately 100  nm diameter carrying long grafted chains of poly(acrylic acid ) ( paa ) adsorbs high amounts of bovine serum albumine ( bsa ) above its isoelectric point where the overall charge of the protein is negative as well .",
    "this discovery of the adsorption of proteins at the `` wrong side '' of the isoelectric point has led to a number of experimental and theoretical studies on planar and spherical systems  @xcite .    in principle , the brush and the protein should repel each other because of two reasons , namely i ) electrostatic repulsion , and ii )  the electrosteric repulsion between the protein and the brush layer : inserting a protein into a polyelectrolyte brush will lead to unfavorable steric interactions with tethered chains of the brush as well as to a raise of the osmotic pressure of the confined counterions .",
    "hence , there must be a strong attractive force which is capable of overcoming these strongly repulsive forces .",
    "three major causes have been suggested to explain the strong attraction observed for a broad variety of systems :    * first , charge inversion of the protein immersed in a polyelectrolyte brush  @xcite .",
    "the ph - dependent protein concentration within the brush layer my be lower than outside in the bulk and below the isoelectric point .",
    "hence , the net charge of the protein changes its sign . * as a second driving force counterion release was invoked  @xcite .",
    "proteins in general carry patches of positive charge on their surface even above the isoelectric point",
    ". these patches can interact with the negatively charged polyelectrolyte chains , thereby releasing a certain number of previously bound counterions into the bulk phase .",
    "since the osmotic pressure within the brush layer at low salt concentration is quite high , it has been argued that the effect of counterion release should be strong and virtually independent of the proton concentration within the brush  @xcite . * as a third cause for attraction , a heterogeneously charged protein globule may be attracted into the brush because the polyelectrolyte brush interacts asymmetrically with the dipole of the protein caused by large charge patches of opposite sign  @xcite .    the combined problem of patchiness and counterion release has been re - considered by de vos _ et al .",
    "_ in a field - theoretical study  @xcite .",
    "these authors concluded that the effect of counterion release is operative but of minor importance .",
    "however , a recent study by he et al .",
    "@xcite using molecular dynamics simulations clearly underscored the important role of counterion release when considering the interaction of proteins with polyelectrolyte brushes .",
    "thus , the role of counterion release and its magnitude is still not fully elucidated .    in order to re - consider this problem",
    ", we first developed a model for proteins with patchy surface charge ( charged patchy protein model , cppm )  @xcite .",
    "the interaction of these model proteins with single polyelectrolyte chains of like charge was studied extensively by implicit - solvent / explicit - salt langevin computer simulations  @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in this study confirmed the general concept of counterion release for highly charged polyelectrolytes .",
    "moreover , a simple theoretical model was shown to capture the salient features of the simulations .",
    "in particular , the binding affinity derived from these simulations using the cppm - model was shown to scale dominantly with the logarithm of the salt concentration in the bulk multiplied by the number of released counterions  @xcite .",
    "this relation had been predicted by record and lohman  @xcite a long time ago and found to be valid in a number of experimental studies  @xcite .",
    "it demonstrates the direct relation between the binding affinity and the translational entropy of the released counterions .",
    "it can be derived directly for the problem under consideration here as shown by henzler _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "here we extend our previous studies  @xcite to explore the interaction of patchy proteins with a thin planar film of a dense like - charged polyelectrolyte brush . in order to keep the problem as simple as possible",
    ", we do not consider the effect of charge reversal and focus on the electrostatic mechanisms for fixed ( ph - independent ) local charge distributions .",
    "the general goal of this study is a fully quantitative assessment of the local electrostatic effects that drive like - charged attraction with a sharpened focus on the details of dipolar and counterion - release effects in the limit of highly charged pe brushes .",
    "our simulations allow us to accurately average out all conformational effects and explore in detail the ionic mechanisms taking place at the pe - patch interface . based on this ,",
    "the various contribution to protein uptake by the brush can be properly characterized and quantitatively compared to analytical models .",

    "the excluded volume part is highly repulsive and completely dominated by the osmotic contributions from the counterions @xmath12 .",
    "this contribution for @xmath13 ( yellow curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : cppm_brush_individual_energies_p-1 - 12 ] ) was taken directly from the reference simulations of the neutral sphere in the charged brush , cf .",
    "the electrostatic part is plotted as the green curve and further subdivided into monopolar repulsion and dipole and born attraction in the inset . here",
    ", the monopole repulsion is very large ( up to 23  @xmath0 ) and partially canceled by the large born attraction ( up to -18  @xmath0 ) .",
    "the dipole part is extremal at the brush surface at @xmath14  nm and remains an attractive contribution inside the brush . for smaller distances @xmath15",
    "nm the net monopole repulsion , however , wins over it . to obtain the prediction of the total pmf",
    ", the counterion - release contribution has to be finally added .",
    "the latter is highly attractive , providing up to 1014 @xmath0 favorable entropy for distances smaller than @xmath16  nm . in total",
    "the prediction adds up to show a stable adsorption at the brush surface at @xmath17  nm and an increasing repulsion closer to the grafting surface .",
    "this description ( blue curve ) is in qualitative accordance with the pmf ( red curve ) directly extracted from the simulation .",
    "apparently , however , the phenomenological description is roughly overall @xmath18  @xmath0 more repulsive .",
    "we believe this discrepancy might stem from the addition of errors we have made in the approximations of the single contributions . in particular , our estimation of the born free energy is probably the weakest of all as we performed only a simple dipolar expansion for the cppm .",
    "the cppm has large surface charge densities in direct contact with the pe chains and mobile ions and thus we believe that the born contribution is in fact more attractive than described by eq .  ( 7 ) and is mostly responsible for the relatively large discrepancy of the phenomenological model .",
    "we finally discuss the salt concentration dependence of the binding affinity @xmath6 represented by the ( global ) minimum values @xmath19 of the pmfs from the ( @xmath2 ) systems .",

    "we get for @xmath4 and for @xmath5 .",
    "the latter indicates ion release in the order of 3 to 4 counterions as the cppm adheres to the brush surface .",
    "although the adsorption is not entirely driven by counterion release , this number is not too far from what we actually observe in our simulations , where we calculate roughly 2.7 ions on average , see the @xmath21 values in table  [ tab : energy_contributions ] .",
    "we also show the results of the phenomenological model from eq .",
    "( [ eq : w_tot ] ) in fig .  [ cppm_brush_p-1 - 12_b-50_binding_affinity ] .",
    "although this approach reveals a systematic deviation between the prediction ( green line ) and simulated data ( red points ) , it qualitatively reproduces the correct trend .",
    "such a good reproduction is non - trivial as the final binding affinity results from cancellation of several repulsive and attractive contributions ( with different individual salt concentration dependencies ) as summarized in detail in table  [ tab : energy_contributions ] .      ) with antipodally aligned patches @xmath22 for patch charges @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the presence of @xmath7  mm salt concentration .",

    "[ fig : cppm_brush_two_patched_p-2 - 8 ]  ( a ) for the 32 mm salt concentration . for @xmath23",
    "the pmfs are essentially repulsive apart from a very shallow minimum at the brush surface at around @xmath16  nm .",
    "this result is actually remarkable as now two patches , that is , twice the number of positive charges , are acting as attractors .",
    "recall that with only one patch , see the pmf of p@xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cppm_brush_one_patched_20 mm ]  ( a ) , we found a significant attraction of @xmath28  @xmath29 . in light of our phenomenological theory , this implies that the increased ( attractive ) counterion - release effects are fully compensated by the monopole and osmotic repulsions , while the attractive dipolar ( cf .",
    "table  1 ) ( and higher order multipolar ) interactions as well as the born energy have become apparently too small to significantly stabilize the minimum .",
    "the situation changes in the case of larger patch charges , @xmath24 , as also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cppm_brush_two_patched_p-2 - 8 ]  ( a ) . here",
    ", evidently the attractive terms , presumably most significantly the counterion - release contribution , clearly outweigh the repulsive interactions .",
    "the amount of released counterions is about a factor of two stronger in the @xmath24 system than for @xmath23 , as indicated by the number of adsorbed monomers shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : cppm_brush_two_patched_p-2 - 8 ]  ( b ) .    note also that there is an interesting small plateau - like region in the pmf of the p@xmath30 cppm at around @xmath16  nm separated by a small hump ( @xmath31  nm ) to the stable minimum at @xmath32  nm .",
    "we found a similar , but more pronounced behavior previously in the pmfs between two - patched cppms and a single pe  @xcite .",
    "the reason in the latter case is that after the first , favorable contact of the pe monomers with one of the two positive patches , a tighter complexation is only possible after the pe wraps around the cppm to reach and adsorb to the second patch , eventually stabilizing the final complex .",
    "however , this wrapping is penalized by electrostatic repulsion ( as the pe moves along the like - charged part between the patches of the globule ) and an energy barrier can appear .",
    "it seems a similar signature can be observed here by two - patched cppms interacting with pe brushes .",
    "noteworthy , the experimental adsorption of @xmath33-lactoglobulin to like - charged spherical pe brushes proceeded in a yet unexplained two - step process  @xcite .    finally , the local cppm orientation , plotted in fig .  [ fig : cppm_brush_two_patched_p-2 - 8 ]  ( c ) , exhibits a rather complex behavior with several extrema , especially for the higher charged , @xmath24 , system .",
    "one maximally oriented configuration of aligned patches parallel to the @xmath26-direction appears at the brush surface at @xmath34  nm , when the first patch interacts with the pe ends .",
    "this is understandable again by a structural picture of pes reaching out towards the first approaching patch and forcing rotation of this cppm patch to face the brush .",
    "the explanation of the appearance of the other , smaller maximum at @xmath35  nm , or the two minima at @xmath36@xmath37 and @xmath38  nm , where the axis connecting the patches is perpendicular to @xmath26 , however , is not so simple . in general , quadrupolar interactions with electric field gradients and orientation - dependent patch adsorption to the inhomogeneously ( in @xmath26-direction ) distributed pe",
    "monomers rule the game , probably a mix thereof , and we leave the detailed exploration of these interesting structural phenomena of multipolar adsorption for future studies .",
    "in summary , we have explored the interaction of simplified patchy protein models and a thin film of a dense pe brush using implicit - water , explicit - salt langevin dynamics computer simulations .",
    "we focused on the regime of highly charged pe chains and proteins with considerable patchiness to investigate in detail the competition of osmotic and electrostatic interaction mechanisms .",
    "we neglected the possibilty of charge regulation and charge inversion of the protein .",
    "the matter of what is the driving force of like - charge attraction of proteins to pe brushes has been controversially discussed in literature  @xcite .",
    "we have found that the patchy particle @xmath39 , which possesses the lowest patch charge density and similar electrostatic features to lactoglobulin  @xcite , already leads to a significant adsorption at low and intermediate ( physiological ) ionic strengths . in all cases we found that the adsorption takes place on the surface of the pe brush , which is reflected by the location of the global pmf minimum .",
    "adsorption has been found to be stronger for lower salt concentrations and higher patch charge .",
    "we note that stronger surface adsorption on the brush surface with higher particle dipole has been also reported by hu _",
    "et al . _ who simulated a coarse - grained model of fullerene - like patchy particles  @xcite .",
    "our analysis has demonstrated the existence of multiple competing interaction mechanisms , most notably the repulsive osmotic and monopolar electrostatic contributions and the attractive multipolar , self - energy ( born ) , and counterion - release mechanisms .",
    "the purely electrostatic contributions due to the inhomogeneous charge distributions , leaving counterion - release aside , have been discussed on a global level previously in the framework of a mean - field poisson ",
    "boltzmann theory  @xcite .",
    "we have described the leading order parts analytically and found that the balance between all of those is complex and specific to the system . in our case",
    "the final adsorption was driven equally by electrostatic and counterion - release mechanisms , overcoming the large monopole and osmotic repulsive interactions .",
    "the strong affinity of the cppm specifically to the brush surface can be traced back to the large dipole interaction , which is maximal at the brush surface , whereas the monopole and osmotic repulsions steeply rise further inside the brush and dominate over the attractive contributions .",
    "cleary , the attractive interactions are determined by the magnitude of the charge of the patches and thus a minimal patch size needs to be present to compete against the repulsion  @xcite which , in turn , is defined by the brush charge and the protein net charge . here , the counterion - release effect is a strong contributor to like - charged attraction as every condensed ion released from a pe chain provides several @xmath0 of binding entropy .",
    "note that we only found these effects taking place on the pe chains , no distinctive condensation behavior could be found on the protein patches  @xcite . in order to have the counterion - release effects active",
    ", the patch should probably carry at least 23 localized charges , such that a pe is likely to locally bind .",
    "we have also found a non - trivial effect of the number ( or geometrical distribution ) of patches , namely doubling the patches did not lead to a higher attraction ; in contrast , the double - patched @xmath40 system showed no stable adsorption , whereas the single - patched @xmath39 did , probably due to the missing dipole attraction and possibly lowered self - energy contribution , such that the monopolar repulsion could not be overcome .",
    "so , while the distribution of patches probably has less influence on counterion release , it has a major influence on multipolar and born electrostatic contributions . in that respect , also the salt concentration dependence of the binding affinity is non - trivial in general , as argued in our phenomenological framework , because all contributions have quite different functional salt dependencies .    to conclude , the question of what is the driving force of like - charge attraction of proteins to pe brushes  @xcite has no unique answer",
    "; there are at least three mechanisms , and which one dominates is system - dependent and governed by ph , pe charges , salt concentration , and charge heterogeneity of the protein .",
    "if , for instance , charge heterogeneity is small and experiments are operated close to the isoelectric point , charge regulation may play an important role  @xcite . far away from the isoelectric point ,",
    "multipolar electrostatics governs the attraction .",
    "if then also the pe charge density is high enough , roughly beyond the onsager - manning - oosawa threshold  @xcite , the counterion - release mechanism sets in and , due to the large entropy gain per ion , can become the decisive driving force .",

    "<S> we study the adsorption of charged patchy particle models ( cppms ) on a thin film of a like - charged and dense polyelectrolyte ( pe ) brush ( of 50 monomers per chain ) by means of implicit - solvent , explicit - salt langevin dynamics computer simulations . </S>",
    "<S> our previously introduced set of cppms embraces well - defined one- , and two - patched spherical globules , each of the same net charge and ( nanometer ) size , with mono- and multipole moments comparable to those of small globular proteins . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on electrostatic effects on the adsorption far away from the isoelectric point of typical proteins , i.e. , where charge regulation plays no role . despite the same net charge of the brush and globule </S>",
    "<S> we observe large binding affinities up to tens of the thermal energy , @xmath0 , which are enhanced by decreasing salt concentration and increasing charge of the patch(es ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the distance - resolved potentials of mean force together with a phenomenological description of all leading interaction contributions shows that the attraction is strongest at the brush surface , driven by multipolar , born ( self - energy ) , and counterion - release contributions , dominating locally over the monopolar and steric repulsions . </S>"
