    "the realization of electro - weak symmetry breaking and cp - violation are two important topics both in the standard model ( sm ) and beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",

    ", we proposed the correlation between lightness of higgs boson and smallness of cp - violation . in this paper",
    ", we will continue to explore an alternative natural scenario and its phenomenology .    in 1964 , the higgs mechanism @xcite was proposed . in the higgs mechanism , a scalar doublet with nontrivial vacuum expectation value ( vev ) was introduced to break the electro - weak gauge symmetry spontaneously . after spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking in the sm , there exists a scalar named the higgs boson . in july 2012 , both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations at lhc discovered a new boson with its mass around @xmath12 gev @xcite .",
    "the subsequent measurements by cms and atlas @xcite on its signal strengths showed that the scalar behaves similarly with sm higgs boson .",
    "however there is still spacious room for the bsm . in some bsm models ,",
    "there exist new light particles which may appear in the final states during higgs decay processes .",
    "for example , in the next - to - minimal super - symmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite , the simplest little higgs model ( slh ) @xcite , or the left - right - twin - higgs model ( lrth ) @xcite , a light scalar @xmath0 with its mass of @xmath13 will naturally appear .",
    "for some cases in 2hdm @xcite , a light scalar @xmath0 is allowed as well , though there are strict constraints on them .",
    "if @xmath14 , there would be an exotic decay channel @xmath15 ; while if @xmath16 , an exotic decay channel @xmath17 should also be open .",
    "there is no evidence for exotic higgs decay channels at lhc till now , the constraints on the exotic higgs decay branching ratio is set to be @xmath18 @xcite if the production rate of the higgs boson is close to that in sm .",
    "the spin - parity property for higgs boson is expected to be @xmath19 in the sm .",
    "experimentally , a pure pseudoscalar state ( @xmath20 ) is excluded at over @xmath21 @xcite . but a mixing state is still allowed , thus the spacious room for bsm scenarios have not been closed yet .    theoretically , cp - violation in sm is induced by the kobayashi and maskawa ( k - m ) mechanism @xcite proposed by kobayashi and maskawa in 1973 .",
    "they proved that a nontrivial phase which leads to cp - violation in quark mixing matrix ( called the ckm matrix @xcite ) would appear if there exist three or more generations of quarks .",

    "@xmath26 @xcite means cp - violation in sm is small .",
    "experimentally , in k- and b - meson systems , several kinds of cp - violation have been discovered @xcite which represent the success of k - m mechanism . while it is still attractive to search for new sources of cp - violation , not only to search for bsm physics , but also to understand the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe @xcite .",
    "sm itself can not provide enough baryogenesis effects @xcite , but in some extensions of sm , for example , 2hdm with cp - violation in higgs sector , it is possible to generate large enough baryogenesis effect @xcite .",

    ", the lagrangian is required to be cp - conserved , but the vev of one higgs doublet can be complex , thus the cp symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the complex vacuum . in this case , the neutral scalars are cp - mixing states so that cp - violation effects should occur in the higgs sector .",
    "all the three neutral scalars should couple to massive gauge bosons with the effective interaction @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the ratio between the @xmath29 coupling strength and that in sm .",
    "@xmath30 due to the mechanism of spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "the quantity @xmath31 measures the cp - violation effects in higgs sector @xcite when the masses of the neutral scalars are non - degenerate .",
    ", thus there would be no cp - violation in higgs sector . ] in our recent paper @xcite , we proposed the correlation between lightness of higgs boson and smallness of cp - violation through small @xmath32 in lee model . while in that paper , we treated the 125 gev scalar as the lightest one thus it implied a strong - interacted scenario beyond @xcite .",
    "however , another natural scenario with a weakly - interacted scalar in which the heavy scalars have the mass @xmath33 is also possible where @xmath34 is the vev of the scalar doublet in sm . in this scenario ,",
    "lee model would predict a light scalar @xmath0 with mass @xmath35 for the small @xmath32 case based on our paper @xcite . in this paper , we will discuss this scenario and its phenomenology .",

    "<S> based on the weakly - coupled spontaneous cp - violation two - higgs - doublet model ( named lee model ) and the mechanism to generate the correlation between smallness of cp - violation and lightness of scalar mass , as we proposed earlier , we predicted a light cp - mixing scalar @xmath0 in which pseudoscalar component is dominant . </S>",

    "<S> it means new physics might be hidden below the electro - weak scale @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> masses of all other scalars ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) should be around the electro - weak scale @xmath2 . among them , the 125 gev higgs boson ( @xmath3 ) couplings are standard - model like , and the charged higgs boson ( @xmath5 ) mass should be around the heaviest neutral scalar ( @xmath4 ) mass . </S>",
    "<S> we discussed all experimental constraints and showed that this scenario is still allowed by data . </S>",
    "<S> the strictest constraints come from the flavor violation experiments and the edm of electron and neutron . </S>",
    "<S> we also discussed the future tests for this scenario . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to discover the extra scalars or exclude this scenario at future colliders , especially at the lhc and @xmath6 colliders with @xmath7 luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we also pointed out that the @xmath8-mediated higgs pair production via @xmath9 ( @xmath10 stand for two of the @xmath11 ) would be the key observable to confirm or exclude cp - violation in higgs sector . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity to test this scenario is worth further studying in detail .    </S>"
