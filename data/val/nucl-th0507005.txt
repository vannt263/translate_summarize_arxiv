    "the study of nuclear matter properties at high densities and at finite temperature has become an important problem since a large variety of data , where matter is being tested at extreme conditions of density , pressure and non - zero temperature , are becoming available in the modern experimental facilities which are already operational .",
    "moreover , the constitution of the interior of neutron and protoneutron stars is also a problem which is receiving much attention in the recent literature .",
    "the crust of the stars , where density is relatively low , can be adequately described by hadronic models .",
    "the correct calculation of the star properties as the radius and the mass depend on the accuracy of the equation of state ( eos ) used to describe its matter .",
    "we have checked that different models , either with constant or with density dependent meson - nucleon couplings present different features at subnuclear densities of nuclear asymmetric matter by comparing the regions of uniform unstable matter @xcite .",
    "the parametrizations of these models generally take into account saturation properties of nuclear matter and properties of stable nuclei .",
    "extensions of the models for very asymmetric nuclear matter or to finite temperatures show different behaviors .",
    "another topic of great interest is the in - medium modification of vector meson properties .",
    "it is well known that the hadron masses are much larger than the sum of its constituents .",
    "one possible explanation for the large masses is that they may be generated dynamically @xcite .",
    "spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is also related with the hadron masses . at high temperature and/or dense matter this symmetry",
    "is expected to be at least partially restored , which modifies the hadron masses and the decay widths @xcite,@xcite .",
    "experimental signature of the in - medium modifications of the vector mesons have been found very recently @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the in medium modifications of the @xmath1 meson were investigated in photoproduction experiments and its mass was found to be lowered . in @xcite",
    "the vector masses were verified to decrease by ten percent in medium .",
    "other experimental results were also reported in the same direction @xcite and still some experiments have been proposed to detect in - medium modifications in a near future @xcite . in order to take into account the in - medium modifications of the hadrons , density dependent relativistic models are certainly more useful than models with fixed parameters . in 1991",
    "brown and rho ( br ) @xcite proposed an in - medium scaling law for the masses and coupling constants for effective chiral lagrangians .",
    "our proposal here is to study hadronic properties under extreme conditions using lagrangians which incorporate br scaling since this has been successfully applied to describe meson properties .",
    "as argued in the literature the br scaling describes the behavior of the light mesons in extreme conditions very accurately .",
    "for example the enhancement of dilepton production observed in heavy ion collisions ( s+au ) in the ceres collaboration and ( s+w ) in the helios-3 is most economically and beautifully described by a chiral lagrangian with br - scaled meson masses @xcite .",
    "the strategy is to assume that the in - medium effective lagrangian has the same structure as in free space accordingly to the qcd constraints but with parameters which are modified in the medium .",
    "so , using this approach we obtain an effective theory with density dependent parameters including many - body correlations in a practical framework .",
    "it has also been shown that it is possible to obtain a relation between the effective parameters of chiral lagrangians in medium and landau fermi liquid parameters@xcite .",
    "so , a link between the effective theory of qcd at mean field level and the many - body theory of nuclear matter is achieved . using this reasoning",
    "the authors in @xcite proposed an effective lagrangian whose parameters scale in nuclear medium according to the brown - rho ( br ) scaling .",
    "we have already shown that one of these density dependent models , to which we refer as tw model @xcite , originally derived at @xmath2 can be extrapolated to finite temperatures once the thermodynamical consistency remains unaltered @xcite .",
    "the important range of temperature which is discussed lies between @xmath3 and @xmath4 mev since the liquid - gas phase transition takes place around @xmath3 mev , the phase transition from hadronic to quarkionic matter around 150 mev and the relevant temperatures in the cooling of a protoneutron star after a supernova explosion takes place go up to approximately 40 mev @xcite . in this work",
    "we discuss another possible application of the formalism we have derived in @xcite in order to incorporate temperature effects in the study of lagrangians with br scaling .",
    "it is well known that the same relativistic models used in order to explain data coming from heavy ion collisions at finite temperature , with appropriate parameter sets , also provide eos which can be used in the solution of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff differential equations @xcite for the calculation of stellar properties such as mass , radius and central energy density .",
    "recent measurements of gravitational redshift of spectral lines provided direct constraints on the mass - to - radius ratio @xcite . in this second case , however , the interpretation of the absorption features as atomic transition lines is controversial @xcite . in recent works",
    "@xcite we have checked that there are relativistic models which can be accommodated within these constraints .",
    "hence , astrophysical observations can help in the choice of appropriate models to describe hadronic matter .",
    "the most common relativistic model used in the description of hadronic matter is the non linear walecka model @xcite .",
    "when applied in nuclear astrophysics , this model is normally extended with the inclusion of hyperons , which are expected to appear at high densities .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a low effective mass at saturation density makes the model inappropriate once hyperons are included .",
    "the inclusion of hyperons makes the scalar meson interaction stronger and hence the proton and neutron effective masses decrease more rapidly with density , acquiring a negative value . as a test of the br scaled model ,",
    "we also extend it to incorporate the eight lightest baryons and enforce @xmath0 equilibrium plus charge neutrality by accommodating the two lightest leptons as well .",
    "the same extension is done within the tw model so that both density dependent models can be compared .",
    "hence , the present work is organised as follows : in section ii the formalism for the br scaled model and its extension to finite temperature are presented , the results are compared with the ones obtained with other relativist models and a discussion is included . in section",
    "iii the br scaled model is modified so that hyperons can be incorporated and @xmath0 equilibrium and charge neutrality are enforced so that an eos can be obtained and applied to compact stars . in the same section the tw model is also considered so that the results from two density dependent models are compared . in section",
    "iv a discussion on the role played by the rearrangement term in different models is presented . finally , in the last section , the conclusions are drawn .",
    "in its simplest version the lagrangian density reads @xcite & = & | + & & + ( _ ^-m_s^2 ( ) ^2 ) -_^+ m_v^2 ( ) _ ^ + & & -_^+^2 _ ^ , [ brlag ] .",
    "where in the notation of @xcite @xmath5 is the nucleon field , @xmath6 the isoscalar vector field , @xmath7 an isoscalar scalar field , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the vector isovector field , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the isospin operator and the masses with asterisk are br - scaled as introduced in @xcite : = = = = ( ) .",
    "[ br ] the scalings of the vector coupling constants are given by = ,   = ,   = , where @xmath12 is the nuclear saturation density .",
    "in the original papers @xcite , @xmath13 was simply taken constant and equal to @xmath14 and hence , not density dependent and , with this simple choice a good description of the ground state was obtained . moreover ,",
    "( ) = , [ phirho ] with @xmath15 in such a way that @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17 and @xmath18 were taken equal or tly greater that @xmath19 . in this work",
    "we propose another possible parametrization , based on the works @xcite , where ( ) = 1-y , [ phirho2 ] with @xmath20 in such a way that a decrease of the meson masses in medium at the saturation point is ten percent , as found experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that , as far as we know this is the first work where asymmetry is taken into account by the appropriate inclusion of the @xmath21 meson in a br scaled model .",
    "one would bear in mind that we are using the letter @xmath21 for both the meson and for the total baryonic density .",
    "as those are common definitions in relativistic models we do not believe it may cause any confusion .",
    "one can see that the lagrangian in ( [ brlag ] ) is of the form of a walecka - type lagrangian and all the finite temperature formalism that we have developed for the density dependent hadron field theory ( ddhft ) @xcite can be immediately applied to these lagrangians .",
    "the thermodynamics of effective lagrangians with br scaling has been studied in @xcite for zero temperature .",
    "the study of the validity of the br scaling hypothesis for the non - zero temperature case is demonstrated in what follows . from the euler - lagrange equations we obtain the field equations of motion in the mean field approximation for infinite matter , where the meson fields are replaced by their expectation values . in this approximation , the expectation value of the @xmath22 , @xmath1 and @xmath21 meson fields",

    "the energy - momentum tensor one easily obtains the hamiltonian operator : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is identified as the effective nucleon landau mass and @xmath37 is the volume of the system .",
    "notice that the energy density does not carry the rearrangement term because it cancels out in a mean field approximation : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the distribution functions for particles and anti - particles respectively and are calculated next . following the notation in @xcite , the thermodynamic potential can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the entropy of a classical fermi gas , @xmath43 is the temperature , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is the proton ( neutron ) chemical potential and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are respectively the proton and neutron densities , calculated in such a way that @xmath48 .",
    "we have @xmath49 where the distribution functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 for particles and anti - particles have to be derived in order to make the thermodynamic potential stationary for a system in equilibrium .",
    "after straightforward substitutions , eq.([omega1 ] ) becomes @xmath50 for a complete demonstration of the above shown expressions obtained in a thomas - fermi approximation for the non - linear walecka model , please refer to @xcite .",
    "at this point , eq.([omega2 ] ) is minimized in terms of the distribution functions for fixed meson fields , i.e. , @xmath51 for the particle distribution function , the above calculation yields @xmath52 where @xmath53 . a similar equation , with a sign difference is obtained for the anti - particle distribution function .",
    "it is important to point out that the fields @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 depend on the distribution function which appear in the definition of @xmath54 , @xmath21 and @xmath55 and hence , the whole calculation is performed self - consistently .",
    "the effective chemical potentials are then defined as @xmath56 and the following equations for the distribution functions can be written : @xmath57}\\ ; , \\quad i = p , n . \\label{disfun}\\ ] ] in the above calculation we have used @xmath58 and @xmath59 . within the thomas - fermi approach",
    "the pressure becomes @xmath60 it is worth mentioning that the thermodynamical consistency which requires the equality of the pressure calculated from the thermodynamical definition and from the energy - momentum tensor , discussed in @xcite , is also obeyed by the temperature dependent brown - rho scaled model .      at this point ,",
    "the parameters used in the br method have to be fixed . through out",
    "this paper the nucleon mass will be @xmath61 mev , the @xmath1 meson mass @xmath62 mev and the @xmath21 meson mass @xmath63 mev .",
    "three different sets are used in @xcite . in what follows we use the parameter set called s3 in @xcite and define another one which we call ma , whose bulk properties are more similar to the nl3 @xcite parameter set but with a larger effective mass at nuclear saturation density . while s3 is a parametrization for the original br scaled model given by equation ( [ phirho ] ) , ma is a parametrization for the new scaling , given in equation ( [ phirho2 ] ) . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we show the s3 and ma constants and in table [ tab2 ] we display the nuclear matter bulk properties described by the different models used in this work .",
    "it is important to point out that the value for the saturation density ( vide * in table ii ) was not given in @xcite . for the saturation density value shown in table [ tab1 ] ,",
    "the compressibility is slightly different from what is stated in @xcite ( 260 mev ) .",
    "this is probably a consequence of the fact that the authors in @xcite have not included the rearrangement term in their calculations .",
    "notice that we distinguish the @xmath64 from the @xmath65 values . in the br scaled models it is the landau mass that should be identified with the nucleon effective mass determined by the qcd sum rule @xcite and its value should lie in between 0.55 m and 0.75 m."
