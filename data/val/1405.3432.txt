    "recent observational cosmology reveals that the primary component of galactic mass is cold dark matter ( cdm ) , which plays essential roles in the evolution of galaxies and the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "so far , studies of galaxy formations based on the cdm scenario indicate that galactic outflows play significant roles in the evolution of galaxies and metal enrichment of intergalactic space .",
    "it is well known that the ratio of gas mass to stellar mass in elliptical galaxies is smaller than that in spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "this deficiency of gas in elliptical galaxies indicates that galactic outflows efficiently remove interstellar gas from these galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition , the low - density intergalactic medium at high-@xmath2 contains a small amount of metals @xcite .",
    "the existence of metals in intergalactic space suggests that galactic outflows transport metals to this space , because the metals should come from stars inside galaxies .",
    "these observed results strongly indicate the importance of galactic outflows in the evolution of galaxies . to realize galactic outflows ,",
    "a sufficient thermal energy supply is required to escape from the gravitational potential well of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "thus far , studies have mainly assumed supernovae and stellar winds as the thermal energy sources .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and cosmic rays have also been presented as sources of thermal energy for driving galactic outflows @xcite .",
    "thus , from the theoretical perspective , there are many possible sources of thermal energy to drive galactic outflows . in the local universe ,",
    "a significant number of star - forming galaxies form starburst - driven outflows @xcite . furthermore , high - redshift galaxies show that the outflow velocity is proportional to the star formation rate and the stellar mass of galaxies @xcite . in contrast , we intend to focus on transonic solutions as galactic outflows without starbursts in this paper . in our model , transonic galactic outflows are driven by energy stored in interstellar gas itself .",
    "@xcite first examined spherically symmetric solar wind and clarified that this solar wind can become supersonic because they begin at the subsonic region and include the transonic point .",
    "this result shows that the energy supply and the gravity are essential for forming the transonic solution .",
    "this transonic solar wind has been actually observed in the outflow from the sun , as evidenced by the success of _ mariner @xmath3 _ in @xcite , and it is well known as the entropy - maximum solution connecting the starting point ( sun ) to infinity @xcite .",
    "several studies have examined transonic galactic outflows in terms of solar wind . @xcite and",
    "@xcite applied the solar wind model to galactic - scale transonic outflows with the stellar halo mass distribution .",
    "@xcite studied the nature of galactic outflows with dmh mass distribution including radiative cooling .",
    "however , owing to an unrealistic assumption of a single power - law dmh mass distribution ( @xmath4 ) , they could not realize transonic solutions .",
    "thus , determination of transonic solutions remains elusive .",
    "@xcite studied steady and spherically symmetric transonic galactic outflows in star - formation galaxies in the gravitational potential of a cdm halo not including stellar mass .",
    "they assumed that the thermal energy was from supernovae and agn radiation . as a result",
    ", they concluded that agn is important for driving high - velocity outflows and that galactic outflows control the observed correlation between dmh mass and stellar halo mass .",
    "however , they assumed fixed transonic points for transonic outflows , although the transonic points should be determined naturally by the ratio of the thermal energy supply to the gravitational potential .",
    "@xcite discussed the influence of gravity from dmh mass distribution on the nature of the transonic solutions .",
    "they assumed dmh mass for the gravitational potential because the dark matter is the dominant component of the gravity source in galaxies .",
    "however , the functional form of dmh mass distribution has not reached a consensus , and many simulations have suggested different mass profiles .",
    "for example , on the basis of the cdm scenario , @xcite concluded by using the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) model that the structure of the dmh distribution is expressed by a double power law , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is radius from the centre of the galaxy and @xmath7 is the scale length of the dmh .",
    "other simulations with higher resolution also supported the double power - law mass distribution in the cdm scenario , although the power - law index was somewhat different .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite suggested @xmath8 .",
    "these numerical models commonly have a  cusp \" of mass distribution at the centre .",
    "in contrast , observations of nearby dwarf galaxies have suggested that their dmh distributions have a flat  core \" at the centre .",
    "@xcite proposed an empirical profile with the core structure as @xmath9 .",
    "this unsolved problem is the so - called core - cusp problem @xcite .",
    "@xcite adopted a functional form of the mass distribution as @xmath10 with a concentration parameter @xmath11 to denote the variety of the distribution at the centre .",
    "this profile approximately reproduces the burkert profile with @xmath12 , the nfw profile with @xmath13 and the moore profile with @xmath14 , as discussed in section 2.1 . by using this distribution model of dmh , @xcite first reported transonic solutions with the gravitational potential of dmh .",
    "in addition , they showed the possibility of a new type of transonic solution in which the transonic point forms in a very distant region ( @xmath15  kpc ) .",
    "however , it is widely accepted that most galaxies have a central super massive black hole ( smbh ) @xcite .",
    "the gravitational potential of smbh must influence the nature of galactic outflows at the central region .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we add the gravity of the central smbh contribution to the tsuchiya model and analyse the transonic solutions , whereas the original tsuchiya model includes only the gravity of dmh .",
    "to construct our model , we assume an isothermal , spherically symmetric and steady state without the injection of mass along the outflow lines , as reported by @xcite , with the aim of clarifying transonic solutions under realistic mass distribution models including both dmh and smbh .",
    "in addition , we apply our model to the sombrero galaxy ( ngc4594 ) to determine the acceleration process of the galactic outflows in an actual galaxy .",
    "@xcite reported a contradiction in that although the trace of the galactic outflow is observed by x - ray , the gas density distribution in this galaxy is well reproduced as the hydrostatic state .",
    "they argued a possibility that the hot gas forms a subsonic outflow , the thermal structure of which resembles , and is difficult to distinguish from a quasi - hydrostatic state .",
    "we attempt to resolve this discrepancy with our model .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we summarize the results of @xcite in section [ result of tsuchiya ] and the influence of the central black hole in section [ result of model ] . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss the application to the sombrero galaxy . in section 4",
    ", we discuss several topics , and we give the conclusion in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we first summarize results of @xcite , then we show our model . here , we assume an isothermal , steady , spherically symmetric outflow model , and we ignore mass injection along the flow except the starting point .",
    "the basic equations are those for the conservation of mass and momentum : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath6 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are gas density , gas velocity , radius from the centre , mass flux , sound speed and gravitational potential , respectively .",
    "@xmath19 is a constant because we ignore the mass injection along the flow except at the starting point .",
    "@xmath20 is also a constant because of the isothermal approximation . substituting @xmath17 from eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we obtain @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mach number , which is equal to @xmath24 ; @xmath25 is the non - dimensional radius defined as @xmath26 ; and @xmath7 is the scale length of dmh mass distribution .",
    "@xcite adopted a model of the mass density profile of dmh as @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents the scale density .",
    "they assumed a simple gravitational potential model that includes the contribution only from dmh , as defined as eq .",
    "( [ dmh model ] ) . in the limit of @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( 0@xmath313 ) and @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "this model well and approximately reproduces various models predicted from both theoretical and observational perspectives .",
    "for example , this model corresponds exactly to the nfw model @xcite with @xmath13 and approximately to the moore model @xcite with @xmath14 and the burkert model @xcite with @xmath12 .",
    "the plausible value of the index @xmath11 remains an open question .",
    "thus , we treat the concentration parameter @xmath11 as a flexible parameter in this study .",
    "we add the gravitational potential of central smbh to the potential model in @xcite .",
    "( [ tsuchiya - n ] ) becomes @xmath34 where @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the newton constant and the mass of smbh , respectively .",
    "integrating eq .",
    "( [ tsuchiya - eq ] ) , we obtain @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the integration constant .",
    "@xcite considered only the effect of the gravity of dmh , which corresponds to @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ thisstudy - mach ] ) .",
    "they determined two types of transonic solutions having single x - point ( transonic point ) with single o - point and that with only one x - point ( figs . 2 . and 4 .",

    ".      in this section , we estimate the effect of the gravitational potential of smbh to the transonic solutions .",
    "the mass density distribution of dmh is widely spread , and the gravitational potential of dmh is dominant in a huge scale of a galaxy . on the contrary ,",
    "the gravitational potential of smbh is dominant in the vicinity of the centre . because of these properties of gravitational potentials",
    ", the mass of smbh must be added to our galactic outflow model to construct a realistic gravitational field model near the centre .",
    "we summarized the obtained transonic solutions for @xmath48 in phase diagrams .",
    "[ fig - thisstudy10 ] shows the phase diagram for @xmath13 ; phase diagrams for other values of @xmath11 are shown in fig .",
    "two types of transonic solutions are apparent , including that with a single x - point and that with a pair of two x - points with one o - point ( fig .",
    "[ fig - thisstudy10 ] ) .",
    "we define the former type as a and the latter type as b. type a has one transonic solution such as the parker solution @xcite . on the contrary",

    "the solutions on the boundaries in fig .",
    "3 are defined as type c. the details of the aforementioned solutions are summarized in table [ table - thisstudy ] .",
    "if the locus of the extreme points of @xmath49 from the centre is longer / shorter than that of the single x - point , the x - point is formed mainly by the gravity of smbh / dmh .",
    "this transonic solution formed by smbh / dmh is shown in the region a-1/a-2 in fig .",
    "[ fig - thisstudy10 ] .",
    "the region with no extreme points is shown as region a-3 in the figure .",
    "these transonic solutions begin at the centre and extend to infinity .",
    "when there are two x - points with a single o - point ( type b ) , the inner / outer x - point is formed by smbh / dmh .",
    "the transonic solution through the inner / outer x - point is referred to as type @xmath50 in this paper . because @xmath42 corresponds to the gravitational potential of dmh , the more @xmath42 increases , the more the outer x - point moves outward . on the contrary , because @xmath43 corresponds to that of dmh , the more @xmath43 increases , the more the inner x - point moves outward . on the boundary between b-1 and b-2 ,",
    "a special transonic solution connecting two x - points appears ( region c-3 in fig .",

    "thus , if @xmath11 is large , the gravitational potential of dmh is more dominant than that of smbh in the vicinity of the centre .",

    "in this section , we apply our model to the sombrero galaxy ( ngc4594 ) to determine the acceleration process of the galactic outflow in an actual galaxy .",
    "the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ detected a diagnostic feature of the galactic outflow as diffuse hot gas in the sombrero galaxy @xcite .",
    "in fact , the estimated amount of the gas component in that galaxy ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) is unnaturally small compared with the predicted gas mass supplied from stellar winds ( @xmath56 ) and type ia supernovae ( @xmath57 ) @xcite . the star - forming rate , estimated as @xmath58 , is lower than that in other early type spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , in comparison with the gas mass supply from which the star - forming rate is deducted , the mass of gas in this galaxy is deficient .",
    "this deficiency implies that the sombrero galaxy experienced drastic extraction of gas owing to galactic outflow .    on the contrary ,",
    "the observed gas density distribution is similar to hydrostatic distribution @xcite .",
    "this hydrostatic - like gas distribution may imply an absence of galactic outflow .",
    "thus , this property is inconsistent with the aforementioned results in which the widely spread hot gas distribution and the deficiency of the gas mass imply the existence of galactic outflow @xcite .",
    "we applied our model to this galaxy to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "for the application of our model to the sombrero galaxy , the mass distribution of this galaxy was determined by observations ( see appendix [ the mass distribution of dmh in the sombrero galaxy ] ) .",
    "the smbh in the sombrero galaxy is believed to be inactive @xcite .",
    "thus , the smbh influences only to gravitational potential .",
    "the observed averaged gas temperature is approximately @xmath59 up to @xmath60  @xmath61 @xcite .",
    ".critical points in the sombrero galaxy with the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo ( dmh ) and super massive black hole ( smbh ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the results given in section [ parameters in actual galaxies ] show that the mass profile strongly affects the acceleration process of outflows .",
    "thus , we can deduce the mass distribution from the velocity distribution of galactic outflow if it can be observed .",
    "for example , for type b-1 in fig .",
    "2 , the flow of the @xmath51 solution is accelerated in the central region under smbh gravity , whereas the flow of the @xmath52 solution is accelerated in the distant region under dmh gravity .",
    "thus , we can deduce the mass of smbh from observed velocity distribution for the case of @xmath51 solution , similarly we can deduce the mass distribution of dmh from observed velocity distribution for the case of @xmath52 solution . in the current technology of x - ray observation , it may be difficult to detect very slow outflow ( @xmath62 100 km s@xmath63 ) of hot gas in detail , although future missions such as _ astro - h _ may enable us to detect it . beyond the traditional analysis based on the kinematics , our method provides a new technique to estimate the mass distributions of dmh and smbh .",
    "we have revealed possible transonic solutions in the gravitational potential of dmh and smbh by using an isothermal , spherically symmetric and steady model .",
    "these solutions are classified from the perspective of their topological features in the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "we conclude that gravitational potential of smbh adds a new branch of transonic solution with the inner transonic point compared with the transonic point generated by the gravity of dmh , whereas the previous research @xcite concluded that there is only one transonic solution in the gravitational field of dmh .",
    "we have analysed the relation between the properties of each gravity source generating transonic solutions .",
    "we conclude that the inner transonic point is generated by the gravity of smbh , whereas the outer transonic point is generated by the gravity of dmh .",
    "the most interesting new feature of this study is the suggestion of two different types of transonic solutions with substantially different mass fluxes and starting points ( figs . 2 and [ mass fluxes ] ) .",
    "thus , these solutions may have different influences on the evolution of galaxies and the release of metals from them .",
    "in addition , we have estimated the parameter ranges of actual galaxies by using the results of previous studies . we have determined that actual galaxies can have two transonic points .",
    "we have applied our model to the sombrero galaxy and have shown the possibility of galactic outflow in this galaxy .",
    "the distribution of dmh is estimated from the observation of globular cluster kinematics .",
    "the transonic solution through the outer transonic point ( @xmath64  kpc ) has a quite similar gas density profile as that of the hydrostatic solution in the widespread subsonic region .",
    "therefore , the existence of the slowly accelerating outflow may support the result of the previous work reporting the coexistence of hydrostatic - like gas distribution and widespread hot gas @xcite . because the sombrero galaxy is not an active star - forming galaxy , this possibility of slowly accelerating outflow indicates that galactic outflow could exist for other quiescent galaxies without active star formation .",
    "although the majority of theoretical researches of galactic outflows have focused on the star - forming galaxies , our results provide new perspectives of galactic outflows that are applicable to quiescent galaxies without active star formation .",
    "indeed , observational studies reported the possible outflows from quiescent galaxies including m31 @xcite and ngc4278 @xcite .",
    "we will apply our model to these objects in the series of our forthcoming studies .",
    "we can estimate the mass distributions of dmh and smbh from the structure of outflow velocity distribution by using our model .",
    "the transonic solution through the outer transonic point suggests mass distribution of dmh , whereas the transonic solution through the inner transonic point suggests mass of smbh .",
    "thus , we can estimate the mass distribution of a galaxy from the observation of outflow velocity .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. bridges et al . 2007 ) estimated mass distribution by using stellar kinematics or orbital motions of globular clusters",
    ". however , the method for the mass distribution estimation presented in this study differs from that in previous methods .",
    "although the velocity of hot gas is difficult to estimate through current x - ray observation techniques , the next generation of x - ray observation will be able to detect detailed structures of galactic hot gas including velocity .",
    "we will attempt to estimate the mass distribution from galactic outflow velocity with a more realistic model in future work .",

    "for the application of our model to the sombrero galaxy , the mass distribution of this galaxy must be determined .",
    "the main components of mass distribution are dmh , smbh and stars .",
    "the smbh mass of the sombrero galaxy is estimated as @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "this smbh is believed to be inactive @xcite .",
    "we estimated the parameters of dmh by fitting to the velocity dispersions of globular clusters @xcite by using the @xmath66 test .",
    "thus , we determined the values of the three parameters ( @xmath67 ) in eq .",
    "( [ dmh model ] ) . in place of the scale density @xmath28 , we used the total mass @xmath68 of dmh inside 25  kpc , which was determined as @xmath69 because the total mass is more easily comprehensible than the scale density .",
    "because we fixed the dmh mass and the smbh mass as the sources of the gravitational potential in our model , we deduced the stellar mass from the observed mass distribution by using the observed stellar mass distribution , as discussed in section [ the model and influence of the stellar mass distribution in the sombrero galaxy ] .",
    "thus , we determined the pure dmh mass distribution excluding the stellar mass and smbh mass .",
    "@xcite also calculated the mass distribution of dmh by using the same observed data @xcite , although we estimated our data by a different method .",
    "first , they used the nfw model .",
    "thus , from the beginning , they were not able to consider the concentration of dmh . on the other hand , our model of dmh distribution in eq .",
    "( [ dmh model ] ) can reproduce the various mass distributions by varying @xmath11 ( section 2.1 ) .",
    "second , although the observed data represents the cumulative mass distribution , the value decreases in the far distance .",
    "thus , we used the data inside the peak ( @xmath7025  kpc ) , whereas @xcite used the data of the entire region .",
    "third , they neglected the mass of smbh ; we added this gravitational potential of smbh to our model .",

    "@xmath71 is reduced to a value less than unity in the wide region from @xmath12 to @xmath73 , but increases rapidly in @xmath74 .",
    "the minimum @xmath66 is in the vicinity of @xmath75 . in this paper , we adopted @xmath76 , and @xmath77 in this case .",
    "this distribution is more widely spread and more massive than that reported by @xcite ."

    "<S> we have applied our model to the sombrero galaxy and obtained a new type of galactic outflow : a slowly accelerated transonic outflow through the transonic point at very distant region ( @xmath0  kpc ) . in this galaxy </S>",
    "<S> , previous works reported that although the trace of the galactic outflow is observed by x - ray , the gas density distribution is consistent with the hydrostatic state . </S>",
    "<S> we have clarified that the slowly accelerating outflow has a gas density profile quite similar to that of the hydrostatic solution in the widely spread subsonic region . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the slowly accelerating transonic solution can not be distinguished from the hydrostatic solution in the observed region ( @xmath1  kpc ) even if slow transonic flow exists . </S>",
