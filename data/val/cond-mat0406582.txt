    "the structure of the free surface of a liquid metal is fundamentally different from that of a dielectric liquid such as water or argon . for dielectric liquids ,",
    "the interatomic or intermolecular potential is long - ranged and the nature of the interactions does not change significantly across the liquid  vapor interface .",
    "theoretical modeling and molecular dynamics studies result in an interfacial density profile that varies monotonically from the bulk liquid density to the bulk vapor density.@xcite this can be contrasted with results of computer simulations of dielectric liquid noble gases in contact with their solid phase.@xcite there , the hard wall provided by the solid phase is shown to induce surface layering in the liquid with a well defined lamellar structure .",
    "in liquid metals , the potential energy function changes drastically from a screened short - ranged coulomb potential in the bulk liquid phase where the conduction electrons are delocalized to a long - ranged van der  waals type potential in the vapor phase where all electrons are localized.@xcite in this case , density functional calculations@xcite and computer simulations@xcite indicate an oscillatory surface - normal density profile .",
    "this surface induced layering can be attributed to the fact that strong coulomb interactions between the abruptly truncated conduction electrons at the surface and the ion cores impose a constraint ordering the surface in a well defined lamellar structure .",
    "this constraint can be thought of as an effective hard wall ionic potential at the surface where the conduction electron density abruptly terminates .",
    "the existence of surface layering in liquid metals has only recently been verified unambiguously by experiment , first for liquid hg@xcite and then for liquid ga.@xcite comparison of the temperature dependence of this layering , however , reveals qualitative differences between the two metals.@xcite this observation indicates that details of the interactions such as the degree of covalency in the metal may affect the surface structure .    for crystalline metals that can be described by weak pseudo ",
    "potentials , electron  ion scattering is relatively weak and the non localized or itinerant electrons can be treated as if they were essentially free.@xcite alkali metals with their nearly parabolic energy bands are the prime example of this class of nearly free electron ( nfe ) like metals . in analogy with this , the term nfe metals applies to liquid metals whose conduction electrons have similar itinerant character and are only weakly perturbated by a small ionic pseudopotential.@xcite nfe liquid metals can be contrasted with those whose conduction electrons are partially localized in covalent bonds.@xcite evidence for such covalent character in liquid metals may be obtained from measurements of the optical properties as well as from the bulk liquid structure factor.@xcite    in fact , both liquid ga and hg show substantial deviations from nfe behavior . in liquid ga , a shoulder in the bulk liquid structure factor indicates the presence of directional bonding in the melt.@xcite liquid hg displays a pronounced asymmetry in the first peak of the bulk liquid structure factor , and the optical constants of liquid hg deviate markedly from the predictions of the drude theory for free electrons,@xcite which , for example , adequately describes the optical constants of the alkali metals.@xcite in order to understand which aspects of surface layering may be affected by deviations from nfe character , it is necessary to investigate liquid metals with less tendency towards covalent bonding .",
    "the alkali metals would be ideal candidates in this regard .",
    "unfortunately , the very low surface tension of liquid alkali metals will result in a large thermally induced surface roughness , making it extremely difficult to observe the surface layering experimentally .",
    "this is exacerbated by the fact that alkali metals are very reactive in air but can not be investigated under ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) conditions due to their high vapor pressure .",
    "liquid indium , which has a high surface tension , reasonably low melting point and low vapor pressure does not suffer from these shortcomings .",
    "moreover , it is considered to be nfe like for the following reasons . first , the first peak in the bulk structure factor of liquid in is highly symmetric , indicating the absence of significant orientational bonding in the melt.@xcite second , quantitative analysis of the shape of the bulk liquid structure factor yields a twelve - fold coordination with an interatomic distance that decreases with increasing temperature.@xcite this is precisely what is expected for a liquid that can be described by an ideal hard sphere model .",
    "third , the measured optical properties of liquid in agree with the drude free electron theory over a large range of wavevectors.@xcite even more interesting , the optical constants of mixtures of liquid hg and in differ appreciably from free electron behavior for hg rich compositions , but gradually approach free electron behavior with increasing in content.@xcite a main objective of this study is to compare the surface structure of the more nfe like liquid metal in to that of the more covalent liquid ga .",
    "this fundamental interest in the relationship between the surface structure and electronic properties of liquid metals bears directly on the topic of surface reactions , which is of considerable practical importance .",
    "this is especially true for liquids , where the atoms are mobile , and reactions at the surface can directly affect alloying , phase formation and other properties of the bulk .",
    "for this reason , surfaces and reactions at surfaces play a critical role in process and extractive metallurgy.@xcite we previously demonstrated that on exposure to oxygen the surface of liquid ga becomes coated with a uniform 5    thick passivating oxide film that protects the underlying bulk phase from further oxidation.@xcite we will show below that the oxidation behavior of liquid in is fundamentally different from that of ga .",

    "was used to select the x - ray wavelength @xmath3    and to tilt the beam downward onto the horizontal liquid metal surface .",
    "the geometry of this liquid spectrometer has been described elsewhere.@xcite additional data were acquired at beamline x22b at the nsls , using a similar scattering geometry and an x - ray wavelength of 1.24   .",
    "the size of the x - ray beam striking the liquid metal surface was determined by 1  mm  ( horizontal )  @xmath4  0.1  mm  ( vertical ) slits downstream of the monochromator and the measured signal was normalized to the incoming beam intensity .",
    "the experimental resolution , determined primarily by slits in front of the detector , was varied for different experimental configurations .",
    "specular reflectivity was primarily measured using a conventional nai scintillation detector .",
    "typical slit settings for measuring this specular reflectivity at x25 were 4  mm  ( h )  @xmath4  4  mm  ( v ) .",
    "at 600  mm from the sample this yields a @xmath5 resolution of 0.06  @xmath6 . for comparable resolution at the longer wavelength at x22b ,",
    "a vertical detector slit of 8  mm was used .",
    "small angle off - specular surface diffuse scattering was measured using a position sensitive detector ( psd ) aligned within the reflection plane.@xcite for a given incident angle , the psd detects both the specular reflection and off - specular diffuse intensity in the reflection plane up to @xmath7 away from the specular peak .",
    "we used a coarse vertical resolution for the psd in the multi channel mode ( 64 channels on 20 mm ) . away from the specular peak , where the intensity varies slowly with position",
    ", data from neighboring channels were averaged together for improved statistics .",
    "counting all photons hitting the detector , and disregarding the positional information , the psd can be used as a conventional counter . in this `` single channel ''",
    "mode the slit settings were 20  mm vertically and 3  mm horizontally , corresponding to a @xmath5 resolution of 0.32  @xmath6 . for all experimental arrangements ,",
    "the signal originating at the surface was separated from the bulk diffuse background by subtracting intensities measured with the detector moved approximately @xmath80.4@xmath9 ( corresponding to @xmath10 ) transverse to the reflection plane.@xcite    the linearity of the psd was checked by comparison of diffuse scans taken with the psd to diffuse data taken by moving the scintillation detector within the reflection plane , and by measuring the specular reflectivity with the stationary psd in a single - channel mode . as we will discuss below , once scaled for the different resolution , the different types of scans perfectly overlap each other .",
    "indium of 99.9995% purity was contained in a molybdenum pan within an ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) chamber to maintain a clean surface.@xcite details of the uhv chamber design can be found elsewhere.@xcite the sample was heated above the melting point of liquid in to @xmath11c .",
    "after a three day bakeout , the pressure was @xmath12  torr , with a partial oxygen pressure @xmath13 , for which the formation time for an oxide monolayer is calculated to be several days.@xcite although patches of oxide were present on the in ingot when it was introduced into the chamber , this oxide was removed by argon ion sputtering ( 2.5  kev , 20  @xmath14a ion current ) at an ar partial pressure of about @xmath15  torr .",
    "the impact of the ion beam induced mass flow along the surface that transported the oxide patches towards the ion beam , thus cleaning the entire liquid  vacuum interface and not only the area hit directly by the ar@xmath16 ions.@xcite data presented here were always taken within one to two hours of sputter cleaning the sample . since data acquired without sputtering but within a few hours reproduced each other , and because of the unique growth properties of oxide on liquid in which will be presented below , we are confident that the measured scattering is intrinsic to a clean liquid indium surface .    a major improvement over experiments described previously is the incorporation of active vibration isolation .",
    "previous measurements eliminated mechanically induced surface waves by utilizing the viscous drag at the bottom of thin samples .",
    "these samples had curved surfaces , requiring a time consuming technique to measure the reflectivity@xcite and making it very difficult to measure at grazing incidence , important for the detection of in - plane ordering . in this work",
    ", the rigid uhv chamber and ion pump assembly were mounted on an active vibration isolation unit,@xcite similar to that used previously in our studies of liquid hg.@xcite with this system we were able to use a sample pan 5  mm deep and 60  mm in diameter , resulting in flat samples where the angular deviation of the surface normal from the vertical across the surface was negligible compared to the critical angle for total external reflection of x - rays .",

    "during oxidation , macroscopic oxide clumps , large enough to be observed by eye , formed at the edges of the sample , while the center remained clean .",
    "x - ray reflectivity measured during oxidation showed no changes until the floating oxide regions grew large enough to reach the area illuminated by the x - ray beam , at which point the macroscopically rough surface scattered the reflected signal away from the specular condition .",

    "the lines represent the fit of the peak amplitude to the exponential form and the slope represents the decay length .",
    "it is also instructive to compare the surface structure factor measured in the reflectivity experiments to the bulk structure factor measured by standard x - ray or neutron diffraction ( figure  [ in_fig : bulk](a ) : indium ; figure  [ in_fig : bulk](b ) : gallium ) .",

    "this indicates that the correlations decay exponentially , and the decay lengths are obtained as the negative inverses of the slopes .",
    "the inset plots show clearly that while the surface and bulk decay lengths are about the same for in , in gallium the surface induced layering decays much more slowly than the bulk pair correlation function .",
    "this is consistent with the nfe nature of in . for ga , by contrast",
    ", the tendency towards covalency may disrupt the hard sphere packing and enable surface correlations that differ from those in the bulk .",
    "another piece of evidence suggesting that directional bonding in the melt might have an effect on surface induced layering stems from the ratio between the surface layer spacing and the bulk nearest neighbor distance .",
    "this nearest neighbor distance is taken from the analysis of the pair correlation function which is the fourier transform of the structure factor depicted in figure  [ in_fig : bulk ] .",

    "it would be interesting to correlate the premelting properties of ga and in crystals with our results for the period of the surface layering and in particular , to examine if the effect of directional bonding that affects the surface structure in the liquid affects premelting of the solid as well .",
    "our diffuse scattering measurements show that the roughness of the liquid in surface can be attributed entirely to thermally excited capillary waves .",
    "this indicates that there are no other detectable inhomogeneities on the surface , such as might be caused by microscopic oxide patches .",

    "if the organic monolayer is compressed beyond its elasticity limit and becomes inhomogeneous , eq.([in_eq : final ] ) no longer describes the experimentally determined ds , and excess scattering is observed that must originate from sources other than thermally activated capillary waves.@xcite this demonstrates the viability of diffuse scattering as a tool for studying surface inhomogeneities .",

    "although exposure of liquid ga to air or to a large amount of oxygen leads to the formation of a macroscopically thick and rough oxide film , exposure to controlled amounts of oxygen under uhv conditions produces a well defined uniform 5    thick oxide film.@xcite this film protects the underlying bulk phase to a certain extent from further corrosion , as further dosage at low oxygen pressures ( @xmath138  torr ) was found to have no effect on the oxide thickness or coverage fraction .",

    "further evidence suggesting a correlation between the degree of covalency in the melt and the surface structure stems from the observation that the compression of the surface layer spacing relative to the bulk nearest neighbor distance is close to the behavior expected for an ideal hard sphere liquid for in but considerably different for ga . controlled oxidation of liquid in results in the formation of a macroscopic rough oxide , unlike the passivating microscopic uniform oxide film that forms on liquid ga .",
