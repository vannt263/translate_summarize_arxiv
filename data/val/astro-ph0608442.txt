    "the true nature of the two candidate ultracompact binary systems originally discovered with _ rosat _ ,",
    "rx j0806 + 1527 @xcite and rx j1914 + 2456 @xcite , has been a source of much controversy .",
    "both systems are soft x - ray sources whose light curves are modulated on periods of 321 s ( rx j0806 , hereafter j0806 ) and 569 s ( rx j1914 , hereafter j1914 ) @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the x - ray light is 100% modulated for roughly half the period @xcite and the optical light is modulated on the same period as the x - ray light @xcite with little evidence for other periodicities ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "it is widely believed , based partially on the stability and singularity of these periods , that the modulations are on the systems orbital periods , @xmath1 ( although see * ? ? ? * for an alternate interpretation ) .",
    "this would make j0806 and j1914 the two shortest period binaries known .",
    "the x - ray production mechanism in these systems has been much debated .",
    "two competing models have come to the fore : the unipolar inductor ( ui ) model @xcite and the direct - impact accretion model @xcite . both model",
    "these systems as white dwarf - white dwarf ( wd - wd ) binaries with @xmath1 equal to the x - ray period . in the ui model ,",
    "a magnetized , more massive primary wd spinning asynchronously with respect to the orbit induces an electric field in the secondary wd and drives a current between the two .",
    "x - rays are produced by resistive dissipation in the primary s atmosphere . in the accretion model ,",
    "the secondary fills it roche lobe ( @xmath13 ) and mass transfer occurs .",
    "the binary s compact geometry leads to the accretion stream directly impacting the primary and no accretion disk forms .",
    "both models lead to a spatially small x - ray production site on the primary , explaining , in principle , the observed x - ray modulation ( see , however * ? ? ?",
    "one potential means of distinguishing between the two models is the _ secular _ time derivative of @xmath1 , or equivalently of the orbital frequency , @xmath4 , @xmath14 .",
    "the ui model predicts @xmath3 .",
    "assuming fully degenerate donors and enforcing exactly that the donor s radius , @xmath15 equals its roche radius : @xmath16 , the accretion model would predict @xmath17",
    ". determinations of @xmath14 from both optical @xcite and x - ray observations @xcite _ all _ show that @xmath3 over the entire epoch of observations . on the assumption that these results reflect the _ secular _ @xmath14 , this has been taken as evidence against accretion models ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the @xmath18 constraint requires a very large mass transfer rate @xmath19 yr@xmath20 and if @xmath0 is significantly below this `` equilibrium '' value , observing a @xmath3 is possible .",
    "the @xmath0 could be lower than expected either due to a non - secular mechanism @xcite or during the mass transfer turn - on phase @xcite .",
    "however , the timescales on which the binary ( re)establishes its equilibrium @xmath0 are estimated to be very short : 100 - 1000 yrs @xcite or 2 - 20 yrs @xcite , making observing such phases unlikely .    here",
    "we reexamine the suggestion j0806 and j1914 are direct - impact accretors seen during the @xmath0 turn - on phase in the context of stellar evolution models developed to realistically address the complete evolution of am cvn binaries . in  2 ,",
    "we show that the population of am cvns forming through a double - degenerate channel ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) naturally produces systems whose contact phase evolution give @xmath1 and @xmath14 consistent with both j0806 and j1914 .",
    "the maximum @xmath0 is sufficiently high in these systems that @xmath13 must penetrate below the donor s photosphere , naturally increasing the @xmath0 growth times to @xmath21 yrs .",
    "we explore in  3 the range of initial conditions that will lead to j0806 and j1914 .",
    "we determine constraints on these initial conditions and present predictions for @xmath11 in j0806 as a diagnostic tool",
    ". finally , we present our discussion in  4 .",
    "we take as our model for j0806 and j1914 a wd - wd binary with primary and secondary ( donor ) masses @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where the donor is pure he .",
    "binary evolution through two common envelope ( ce ) phases can produce such systems that gravity wave ( gw ) emission can drive into contact within a hubble time @xcite . during this pre - contact phase , the donor cools and contracts .",
    "variations in the donor s pre - ce entropy and time to contact lead to a range in the donor s degeneracy and radius , @xmath15 , at contact @xcite . for fixed @xmath23 ,",
    "less degenerate donors have larger @xmath15 , leading to longer @xmath1 at contact , @xmath24 .",
    "we parameterize the system s state at contact by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the range of @xmath25 , @xmath26 pairs we consider are taken from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 range is determined using the prescription outlined in @xcite with slight modifications detailed in a companion paper ( deloye et al .",
    "2006 , _ in preparation _ ) . for this population",
    ", fully degenerate donors produce @xmath28 min ; a realistic treatment of pre - contact donor cooling gives @xmath24 extending well above 10 min @xcite . _",
    "thus an accretion model can easily accommodate the @xmath1 of both j0806 and j1914 as early contact systems_.    we have carried out a range of evolutionary calculations beginning from the initial conditions determined above .",
    "we utilized a coupled stellar / binary evolution code specifically developed for these calculations and followed each model s evolution from pre - contact through the late stages of the mass transfer phase .",
    "we assume conservative mass transfer , circular orbits , and that gw emission is the only source of orbital angular momentum , @xmath29 , loss .",
    "we use the prescription of @xcite to calculate @xmath0 when @xmath30 and adopt the prescription of @xcite when @xmath31 .    under these assumptions , @xmath14 is given by @xmath32\\ , , \\label{eq : nudot}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is given in @xcite , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "as @xmath36 , the first term in equation ( [ eq : nudot ] ) drives @xmath3 ; a sufficiently high @xmath0 is required for @xmath37 .",
    "after the donor comes into contact , there is a period of time in which both @xmath38 and @xmath3 .",
    "how quickly @xmath14 reaches 0 depends on the growth rate of @xmath0 .    to place j0806 and j1914 in the context of the turn - on phase in am cvn binaries",
    ", we show in figure [ fig : nudot_porb ] the @xmath14-@xmath1 evolution for a sample of our calculations .",
    "solid lines originating on the same dotted line share the same @xmath25 , @xmath26 , but different @xmath27 .",
    "the dotted lines show the corresponding relation for gw losses alone .",
    "the diamonds show the measured @xmath14 for j0806 ( @xmath39 hz s@xmath20 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and j1914 ( @xmath40 hz s@xmath20 ; * ? ? ?",
    "_ the set of initial conditions expected for double - degenerate channel am cvn progenitors naturally produce secular evolution consistent with the observations of both systems_. while j0806 is consistent with a system whose @xmath14 is dominated by gw losses , j1914 is only so for very low values of @xmath25 , @xmath26 : at @xmath41 , if @xmath42 , @xmath43 is required .",
    "the combination of these low masses are not plausible outcomes of binary evolution @xcite .",
    "thus , regardless of x - ray production model , a significant negative contribution to @xmath14 ( e.g. , due to mass transfer or properly oriented spin - orbit coupling , as in the ui model ) is _ required _ for j1914 . in an accretion model , this means the @xmath0 in j1914 must be large .    while for @xmath44 , @xmath0 grows exponentially with @xmath45 @xcite , this growth rate slows considerably once @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the donors also initially have non - degenerate outer layers that , in most cases , are predominantly radiative , producing contraction upon mass loss during the @xmath0 turn - on phase .",
    "sub - photospheric mass transfer and donor contraction both increase the duration of the turn - on phase beyond the previous estimate of @xmath46 yrs made for j0806 at @xmath47 @xcite . in our full calculations , systems with @xmath48 min",
    "reach @xmath49 after @xmath50 yrs .",
    "am cvn binaries remain in the @xmath0 turn - on phase significantly longer than previously estimated . _",
    "we have shown that a secular @xmath51 does not preclude accretion driven models for j0806 and j1914 .",
    "we now discuss the implications of accretion models for these systems .",
    "we first determine @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 leading to systems consistent with the observed @xmath1 and @xmath14 in j08086 and j1914 and use the successful initial conditions to determine expected ranges for current system properties .",
    "we first consider @xmath11 in j0806 . for gw emission alone",
    ", this is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the system s chirp mass .",
    "for @xmath2 , @xmath54 generically . for models passing through @xmath55 and @xmath56 hz s@xmath20 , we calculate @xmath11 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , @xmath59 are the potential at the inner lagrange point and surface of the accretor @xcite .",
    "we plot these predictions in figure [ fig : j0806_nddot_lacc ] .",
    "the lines connect models with equal @xmath26 and larger @xmath60 values correspond to larger @xmath27 . for low @xmath0 ,",
    "larger @xmath27 requires larger @xmath61 to satisfy the @xmath14 constraint .",
    "as @xmath27 increases , @xmath0 contributions to @xmath11 become important , reducing @xmath11 and eventually driving it negative .",
    "for j0806 , the observed x - ray luminosity is @xmath62 erg s@xmath20 ( for a distance of 500 pc ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . given uncertainties in the source distance and the conversion efficienct of accretion energy into soft x - rays , we take as a rough upper limit for @xmath63 erg s@xmath20 .",
    "this places j0806 in the regime where @xmath0 contributions to @xmath11 are of order or less than gw contributions .",
    "we predict @xmath64 hz s@xmath10 . given a phase measurement accuracy of @xmath65 , a total timing measurement baseline of 20 yrs should be sufficient to constrain @xmath11 at this level ( strohmayer 2006 , _ private communication _ ) .",
    "thus , this prediction should be testable within 5 - 10 yrs .",
    "we indicate by solid symbols in figure [ fig : j0806_nddot_lacc ] systems in which accretion is via direct impact .",
    "systems which form a disk ( open symbols ) are unlikely models for j0806 since it is then unclear how the 100% modulation of the x - ray light would be obtained .",
    "the direct - impact constraint requires @xmath66 in j0806 .",
    "we also check if the advection of orbital angular momentum onto the accretor is significant @xcite .",
    "we compare the gw @xmath33 to @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the effective radius at which an orbit has the same specific angular momentum as the transferred matter ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and find that for @xmath69 erg s@xmath20 advection contributies @xmath70 to the @xmath29 evolution .",
    "finally for the direct - impact models , @xmath71 yrs ( increasing with @xmath60 ) .    for j1914 , the small @xmath14 requires a large @xmath72 yr@xmath20 . at its longer @xmath1 ,",
    "the phase space leading to direct - impact systems is small : we find that @xmath73 is required and that @xmath27 must be close to the smallest value producing systems consistent with j1914 .",
    "this @xmath26 range is that most likely produced by binary evolution @xcite , so a fine - tuning problem is somewhat alleviated .",
    "the potential contribution of @xmath29 advection onto the accretor is significant in j1914 : @xmath74 .",
    "given the large uncertainty in tidal synchronization rates that would feed this @xmath29 back into the orbit ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , we leave this point for future investigation .",
    "our direct - impact accreting models have @xmath75 and @xmath76 yrs , consistent with the estimates for @xmath77 erg s@xmath20 @xcite .    with the assumption that any @xmath29 advection is negligible or is cancelled by sufficiently strong tidal coupling , we can place constraints on initial conditions producing systems consistent with j0806 and j1914 . in figure",
    "[ fig : poi_lacc ] , we show our constraints on @xmath24 vs. @xmath60 .",
    "we have shown that the measured @xmath14 in j0806 and j1914 are consistent with the _ secular _ @xmath14 expected for accretion driven systems leading to am cvn binaries .",
    "as such , the @xmath14 measurements _ do not _ provide a means of distinguishing between accretion and ui models posited for these systems . we have shown that accretion models consistent with observations give @xmath71 yrs in j0806 and @xmath76 yrs in j1914 . for comparison , @xcite estimate that the ui timescale for j1914 is @xmath78 yrs .",
    "we also predicted that accretion models give @xmath79 hz s@xmath10 for j0806 ; another 5 - 10 yrs baseline of timing j0806 will be sufficient to test this prediction .",
    "quantitative predictions of @xmath11 for the ui model are needed to determine if @xmath11 will be a useful diagnostic tool .",
    "our calculations also constrain each system s initial conditions and we relate the current @xmath60 to @xmath24 in both j0806 and j1914 .",
    "recenlty , @xcite proposed that j0806 could be modeled with a degenerate he wd donor with a thick h atmosphere supporting @xmath80 burning . in their model",
    ", @xmath1 decreases until the h layer is removed , exposing the degenerate he wd . our pure he donor models shows that a thick h layer is not necessary to explain a phase where @xmath3 during early - contact am cvn evolution . the combination of sub - photospheric mass transfer and spread in initial donor degeneracy are sufficient to produce either j0806 and j1914 .",
    "indeed , j1914 is naturally accomodated within the am cvn initial conditions of our model , but not by @xcite , presumably becuase they assume a fully degenerate donor interior .",
    "we agree , however , that the presence of h in j0806 or j1914 is not unexpected given the uncertainty in the amount of h left on the donor after the ce phase .",
    "pure he models are a limiting case that could be altered to include an arbitrarily thick h layer , changing our results quantitatively . as such",
    ", a detection of h in j0806 or j1914 does not rule out accretion models nor on its own discriminate between our and the @xcite models .",
    "future work on these systems must seek to diagnose the source of their x - ray light .",
    "an avenue for this would be consideration of the optical output of the systems where we would expect significant differences between the ui and accretion models .",
    "assessment of potential fine - tuning problems for accretion models in j1914 is also needed .",
    "this would be best performed in a general study addressing the detection probability for early contact am cvns .",
    "semi - degenerate systems are formed less frequently @xcite , but evolve more slowly at longer @xmath1 , so the _ a prioi _ expectations are unclear .",
    "this would also constrain theoretical expectations for the intial conditions leading to am cvn binaries .",
    "the usefulness of such studies , however , hinges on the determination that j0806 and j1914 are indeed direct - impact accretors , not unipolar inductors .",
    "the community should continue efforts toward distinguishing between these models for these enigmatic systems .",
