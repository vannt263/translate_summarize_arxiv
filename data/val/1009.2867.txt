    "in quantum information theory the fundamental unit of information is a two - level system , the qubit . as in the classical information science , in principle ,",
    "all quantum information tasks can be performed based only on qubits and on quantum gates working on qubits . for practical reasons ,",
    "however , there may be a significant advantage in introducing the use of higher dimensional systems for encoding and manipulating the quantum information .",
    "such @xmath0-level quantum systems , or _ qudits _ , provide a natural extension of qubits that has been shown to be suitable for prospective applications such as quantum cryptography and computation @xcite .",
    "the growing interest in qudit states lies on two main aspects . on one hand ,",
    "the adoption of multi - dimensional states has been proven to increase the efficiency of bell - state measurements for quantum teleportation and to enhance the violation of bell - type inequalities @xcite . on the other hand , besides implications in fundamental quantum mechanics theory @xcite , the qudit offers several advantages in the quantum information field @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath0-dimensional states are more robust against isotropic noise hence offering higher transmission rates through communication channels @xcite .",
    "several quantum cryptographic protocols have been developed in order to capitalize the usefulness of these states , especially their capability to increase the security against eavesdropping attacks and the noise threshold that quantum key distribution protocols can tolerate @xcite .",
    "furthermore , qudits offer advantages also for more efficient quantum gates @xcite , and for quantum information protocols @xcite .    in the last years",
    ", many different implementations of qudits have been proposed and demonstrated ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in quantum optics , implementations of _ qutrits _ ( @xmath1 ) and _ ququarts _ ( @xmath2 ) states have been for example carried out by exploiting two - photon polarization states @xcite . in such case , a natural basis for the ququart hilbert space of a photon pair is the following : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 refer to the horizontal and vertical linear polarization states , and @xmath6 denote the two photon modes .",
    "hence a pair of photons can be exploited to encode a ququart state .",
    "when the two modes coincide ( @xmath7 ) , a qutrit system is obtained since the two states @xmath8 and @xmath9 become indistinguishable .",
    "different experiments on biphoton qudits have been performed by adopting the spontaneous parametric down - conversion process ( spdc ) : preparation and measurement of ququarts encoded in polarization and frequency degrees of freedom @xcite , realization of polarization qutrit from nonmaximally entangled states @xcite , entanglement between ququart systems @xcite .",
    "a biphoton implementation however has several limitations .",
    "first of all the rotated basis of the ququarts correspond to entangled states of the biphoton .",
    "furthermore the implementation of unitary operation on a single quantum system requires an interaction between two photons , a task that can be achieved only probabilistically with linear optics .",
    "finally the detection efficiency scales as @xmath10 where @xmath11 includes transmission losses and detection efficiency , thus low implementation rates are typically achieved .    an alternative approach to realize photon qudits",
    "is that based on degrees of freedom other than polarization , within a single photon . in this context",
    ", a particularly attractive choice is the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of light , providing a natural discrete high - dimensional basis of photon quantum states within a given longitudinal optical mode @xcite . up to now",
    ", qudits with @xmath1 and @xmath2 encoded in photonic purely oam systems have been generated @xcite and employed in quantum communication @xcite , quantum coin tossing @xcite , quantum bit commitment @xcite , and quantum key distribution @xcite . however , despite its many potential advantages , the use of oam has been so far limited by technical difficulties arising in the full manipulation and transmission of this degree of freedom .",
    "for example , in contrast to polarization , oam coherent superpositions are affected by simple free - space propagation , owing to the different gouy - phases associated with different oam values .",
    "+ in the present manuscript we manipulate the polarization and oam degrees of freedom to generate a ququart encoded in a single photon .",
    "since we exploit two different degrees of freedom of the same particle , we refer to _ hybrid_-ququart states .",
    "such results have been achieved through the q - plate device @xcite , which couples the spinorial ( polarization ) and orbital contributions of the angular momentum of photons .",
    "a complete characterization of the ququart states has been carried out by the quantum state tomography technique .",
    "let us consider the bidimensional oam subspace with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes here the oam per photon along the beam axis in units of @xmath14 .",
    "we will denote such subspace as @xmath15 . according to the nomenclature @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 stand for the photon quantum state ` kets ' in the polarization and oam degrees of freedom , the logic ququart basis @xmath19 can be re - written as : @xmath20 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) refers to horizontal ( vertical ) polarization .",
    "following the same convention , the oam equivalent of the two basis linear polarizations @xmath21 and @xmath22 are then defined as @xmath23 finally , the @xmath24 angle `` anti - diagonal '' and `` diagonal '' linear polarizations will be hereafter denoted with the kets @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and the corresponding oam states are defined analogously : @xmath27     works with probability equal to @xmath28 , however a deterministic implementation can be achieved by adopting the scheme proposed in @xcite .",
    "the preparation stages for states @xmath29 are deterministic .",
    "all the analysis schemes are probabilistic with @xmath30 , but the setup for @xmath31 can be again made deterministic by exploiting the @xmath32 transferrer proposed in @xcite . ]    since we deal with a four - dimensional hilber space , the complete characterization of a ququart state is achieved by defining and measuring five mutually unbiased bases with four states each @xcite .",
    "indeed a density matrix of a d - dimensional quantum system can be completely reconstructed from the measurements with respect to @xmath33 mutually unbiased bases @xcite .",
    "the twenty states composing the five mutually unbiased bases , denoted as @xmath34 , are reported in table i both in the ququart logic basis as well as in the oam - polarization nomenclature .",
    "let us stress that while the bases @xmath31 correspond to the measurement of @xmath35 on the two qubit systems -where the _ tilde _ @xmath36 denotes the pauli s operator for oam states- the bases @xmath29 refer to entangled states between polarization and oam .",
    "the main feature of the q - plate is its capability of coupling the spinorial ( polarization ) and orbital contributions of the angular momentum of photons .",
    "a q - plate ( qp ) is a birefringent slab having a suitably patterned transverse optical axis , with a topological singularity at its center @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     let us stress that the adoption of the q - plate has allowed the reconstruction of the density matrix also for the states belonging to the fourth and fifth basis , related to entangled states between orbital angular momentum and polarization of a single photon .    . on axis",
    "are reported the states @xmath37 , schematically written as @xmath38 . on the ordinate",
    "are reported the elements of the density matrix . ]",
    "the previous approach requires the measurements of @xmath39 operators and the corresponding @xmath40 eigenstates .",
    "a more efficient quantum state reconstruction could be achieved by adopting all the mutually unbiased bases as just proposed and demonstrated with a 2-photon system by @xcite .",
    "the reduced number of bases in a mutually unbiased basis tomography allows to reduce by a factor @xmath41 the number of measurements to achieve the same reconstruction accuracy .",
    "moreover , this technique turned out to be even more efficient for entangled states since it directly estimates the strength of correlations in entangled bases ( @xmath42 and @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have experimentally carried out the encoding of a ququart state in the polarization and orbital angular momentum of a single photon .",
    "the states generated have been fully characterized through the quantum state tomography by measuring all the five mutually unbiased bases expected in a four - dimensional hilbert space . the capacity to manipulate with high reliability all quqart states encoded in a single photon",
    "enforce the achievement of the quantum state engineering of ququart to direct towards the implementation of new quantum information protocols and more robust communication procedures .",
    "in particular , single - photon encoded ququart states could be adopted for the implementation of a quantum key distribution protocol without a reference frame recentely proposed @xcite , as well as for the implementation of a universal unitary gate @xcite .",
    "finally the advantage of encoding a ququart state in a single photon could be exploited for quantum information protocols like the optimal quantum cloning of quantum states with dimension @xmath43 @xcite .",
