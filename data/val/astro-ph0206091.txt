    "high resolution spectroscopy of quasars reveals large numbers of absorption lines due to neutral atomic hydrogen . in some cases",
    ", the neutral hydrogen column density can be very large ( @xmath4 ) and gives rise to a heavily damped absorption feature ( ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a catalogue of these damped lyman alpha absorption systems ( dlas ) and , where known , the radio flux densities of the background quasar .",
    "the catalogue has been compiled from the large number of studies reported in the literature .",
    "the nature of dlas is still open to debate .",
    "interpretations include galactic disks @xcite , low surface brightness galaxies @xcite or dwarf galaxies @xcite intersecting the sight - line towards a background quasar . despite these possible differing morphologies ,",
    "dlas provide a powerful cosmological probe .",
    "the highest redshift ( @xmath5 ) dlas may account for a large fraction of the baryons at high redshift , suggesting they reveal gas prior to the bulk of the star formation history of the universe ( and references therein ) . on the other hand , recent work @xcite seems to indicate star formation rates which continue to increase with increasing redshift up to the highest galaxy redshifts observed in the hubble deep field .",
    "the discovery of a dla with truly primordial abundances would have a major impact on our understanding of the early chemical evolution of the universe , and a crucial reality check on the ever - elusive population iii .",
    "this will also be important for studies of primordial deuterium abundances ( see below ) , since deuterium is destroyed , and never created , by star formation and evolution .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy can be used to study high chemical abundances over a large redshift range . in particular , the difficult ionisation corrections required to derive meaningful chemical abundances in lyman - limit absorbers ( where @xmath6 , so that they are optically thick to lyman continuum radiation , ) can be avoided using dlas since the observed hydrogen is probably all neutral @xcite . additionally , at high neutral hydrogen column densities",
    ", species such as znii and crii may become detectable , which are important since depletion onto dust grains is thought to be negligible for the former , whereas the latter remains in the solid phase .",
    "this allows both the study of abundances and depletion patterns / dust reddening ( see ) . some further reasons why dlas are of interest are :    1 .",
    "studies of the higher order hydrogen lyman series in dlas can be used to investigate the primordial deuterium abundance @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using dlas is that the deuterium column density can be somewhat larger than typical lyman forest absorbers .",
    "this may help to discriminate against hi interlopers mimicking the deuterium line .",
    "two recent observational studies @xcite report such d / h measurements",
    "radio observations of quasars with a sufficiently high radio flux density can provide information complementary to that of the dla observations : 21 cm hi measurements reveal more detailed kinematic information since line saturation is less severe and provide a direct spin temperature of the cool component of the gas .",
    "different radio and optical morphology of the background quasar also provides the opportunity of observing along slightly different sight - lines through the same absorption complex , with the potential of learning about the relative sizes of optical / radio emission regions and the cloud size of the absorbing gas . in those rare cases where the host quasar has a sufficiently strong millimetre flux and a foreground molecular cloud occults the quasar @xcite , a wealth of detailed chemistry",
    "is revealed @xcite .",
    "studies of high redshift dust in dlas gives a handle on the chemical evolution and star formation rates at various cosmological epochs @xcite through the contribution of dust to quasar spectral energy distributions ( ) .",
    "certain heavy element transitions provide cosmological probes of special interest .",
    "for example , species with ground and excited state transitions sufficiently close to each other in energy provide a unique means of measuring the cosmic microwave background temperature at high redshift @xcite .",
    "finally , recent detailed studies of the relative positions of heavy element atomic optical transitions and comparison with present day ( laboratory ) wavelengths , suggests that the fine - structure constant ( @xmath7 ) may have evolved with time .",
    "inter - comparing atomic optical transitions with hi 21 cm and molecular millimetre transitions may yield an order of magnitude over the already highly sensitive optical results @xcite .",
    "however , very few such constraints are available due to the paucity of quasar absorption systems where 2 of the 3 types of transition ( optical atomic , hi 21 cm or molecular millimetre ) exist .",
    "it is this last point which is of interest to us : as well as providing a comprehensive list of these objects for use by the astronomical community in general ( section 2 ) , this catalogue allows us to shortlist those dlas most likely to exhibit radio absorption lines in order to further constrain the variation in fine - structure constant . in the final sections we present the dlas occulting radio - loud quasars along with any radio absorption features published and outline our future plans regarding the sample",
    "in table 1 , for the column density we note that argue that when @xmath8 is estimated directly from the absorption line equivalent width , the value is systematically underestimated when compared to the estimate derived using voigt profile fitting .",
    "this may be due to a biases associated with estimating the quasar continuum due the presence of lyman forest absorption lines .",
    "the value of @xmath8 quoted in the table in this paper are those values reported in the original sources , and are not corrected using the relation given in corbelli , salpeter & bandiera ( 2001 ) .    note also that the visual magnitude is obtained from the dla reference , vron - cetty & vron ( 2001 ) or , failing these , ned , which gives an approximate value . for the radio flux densities",
    ", @xmath9 is either the 0.33 ghz wenss , 0.37 ghz texas or 0.41 ghz mrc flux density ( see section 2.2 ) , and where both flux densities are available the 365 mhz value is quoted . in the case of the texas survey , `` x '' denotes that the quasar was not detected at the flux density limit of 0.25 jy ( douglas et  al .",

    "in the appropriate columns , `` x '' also designates if the object is not considered a 2.7 or 5.0 ghz radio source ( vron - cetty & vron 2001 ) and where the 22 and 37 ghz values are quoted as approximate refers to the average value from 15 years of monitoring by tersranta et  al .",
    "in general , approximate values are used when the flux density is obtained from more than one reference and the values given do not exactly agree . finally , ``  ''",

    "however , the ratio of the hyperfine neutral hydrogen ( 21 cm ) to an optical resonance transition frequency is directly proportional to @xmath113 about 10 times larger .",

    "this may suggest several strategies for finding similar new absorbers @xcite which could prove useful in appending to this catalogue .",
    "we have performed an exhaustive search of the literature in order to produce a list of all known damped lyman alpha systems and their associated radio properties .",
    "it is the 57 radio - loud systems in which we are interested as many of these have the potential to show   absorption in each dla . of the sources searched",
    ", it is seen that several exhibit such absorption and we are involved in an ongoing project to search for this in the remaining systems . not only will this give us radio lines for comparison with optical data in order to constrain any temporal variations in the fine structure constant , but we will have a significant sample from which we could consider why some dlas absorb in hi whereas others do not .",
    "for example , suggest that low redshift dlas may arise from a multitude of absorbers , and hence do not have sufficient path length for   absorption , while those of higher redshift are due to more compact systems . finally , as well as finding new hi absorbers , we hope that this catalogue will prove useful to those using damped lyman alpha systems as part of their research . +",
    "* final note : * in order to retain its usefulness to the astronomical community , we have now produced an on - line version of this catalogue which will be continually updated .",
    "this is available from _ http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/@xmath167sjc / dla_.",
    "we wish to thank the john templeton foundation for supporting this work , the two anonymous referees and barry madore at ned for their comments , sandra ricketts of the anglo - australian observatory library as well as fredrik rantakyr , sara ellison , ken lanzetta and especially nissim kanekar for giving us the preliminary results of his   survey .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) as well as the vizier database of cds catalogues @xcite ."
