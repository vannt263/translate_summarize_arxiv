    "in recent years several lagrangian type closures have been developed to model fluctuations of turbulent incompressible fields @xcite .",

    "the _ restricted euler _ model is already able to capture geometric features of vortex stretching and alignment but fails as a robust model to obtain stationary statistics due to the appearance of finite time singularities .",
    "several strategies have been applied to regularize the restricted euler model where the most prominent ones are the _ tetrad model _",

    "we extend the _ recent fluid deformation _ approach to the case of the time evolution of the gradient of passive scalar and to kinematic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "comparing these two examples is especially interesting since both examples differ mainly by a sign in the stretching term .",
    "thus structures which are expanded in one equation ( e.g. gradient of passive scalar ) are compressed in the other ( e.g. mhd ) .",
    "comparison with direct numerical simulations are performed to test the range of applicability of the extended _ recent fluid deformation _ models .",
    "before we apply the _ recent fluid deformation _ approach to the gradient of a passive scalar and to kinematic mhd turbulence , we first recall the main steps in the derivation of this model .",

    "the change between eulerian and lagrangian coordinates @xmath11 twice - while neglecting higher orders - one obtains @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the _ short - time cauchy - green tensor _ resulting from the integration of the flow map .",
    "the time @xmath14 is chosen of the order of the kolmogorov time so that it is possible to linearize the integration from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .    applying a similar reasoning to the viscous term results in the approximation @xmath17 , @xmath18 being a characteristic friction time such that the reynolds number @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath20 @xcite . in all simulations described below",
    ", the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 were chosen which result in a taylor - reynolds number of @xmath23 .",
    "this value is in the range of the performed dns simulations ( see table [ table : paramscalar ] ) .    finally , one obtains a stochastic ordinary differential equation ( sde ) @xmath24 where the stochastic forcing term @xmath25 is added to represent large scale forcing .",
    "the sde ( [ eq : final ] ) can be integrated with standard methods for stochastic equations @xcite .",

    "the forcing is chosen to be vectorial gaussian noise , delta - correlated in time , as for the velocity gradient .",
    "the forcing amplitude is @xmath32 as for a standard random walk .",
    "the parameters for the result shown here are @xmath33 and @xmath22 .    in order to test the applicability of the _ recent fluid deformation _ approximation",
    ", we performed direct numerical simulations for passive scalar turbulence .",
    "for this , we utilized the pseudo - spectral simulation framework latu @xcite .",
    "table [ table : paramscalar ] summarizes the relevant parameters of the simulation .",
    "this model extension has been analyzed in @xcite in great detail , considering important phenomena like amplification of the gradient s norm and alignment to strain principal axes .",
    "but in contrast to this publication , we focus on the comparison of different turbulent systems .    [",

    "the pdf obtained from the direct numerical spectral simulation is shown .",
    "the qualitative agreement is excellent and the tails of the pdfs of @xmath34 approximately follow an exponential decay behavior as predicted by shraiman and siggia @xcite for a gaussian velocity field .",
    "we start with the incompressible mhd equations in the kinematic regime neglecting the back - reaction of magnetic fluctuations on the velocity field .",
    "the equation for the time evolution of the magnetic field @xmath35 reads @xmath36 where the velocity field obeys the navier - stokes equations  ( [ eq : ns ] ) . in the lagrangian frame",
    "this equation takes the form @xmath37 again , using the same _ recent fluid deformation _",
    "approximation for the resistive term and adding a stochastic forcing , which is as above gaussian and white - in - time , we obtain @xmath38    note that this equation differs from by the transpose in @xmath39 and - more important - the sign of the first term on the right hand side . thus directions , where the magnetic field is stretched , are directions , where the gradient of the passive scalar is compressed and vice versa .",
    "this very different influence of the stretching term results in a qualitatively different pdf for the magnetic field fluctuations compared to the @xmath34 fluctuations . in order to test",
    "whether the _ recent fluid deformation _ approach is able to reproduce the different role of the stretching term , we performed direct numerical simulations of kinematic mhd turbulence . here",
    ", we again performed simulations using the framework latu and the relevant parameters are given in table [ table : paramscalar ] .",
    "the simulation was started with random initial condition for the magnetic field @xmath35 and an already fully turbulent velocity field .",
    "external forcing was only applied to the velocity field by keeping the large scale fourier - modes @xmath40 constant .",
    "the top of figure [ fig : b ] shows the pdf of magnetic field fluctuations calculated using equations ( [ eq : final ] ) and ( [ eq : sde_mhd ] ) .",
    "this pdf has to be compared to the pdf obtained from direct numerical simulation shown in the bottom of figure [ fig : b ] .",
    "it is again remarkable that the simple stochastic ode model ( [ eq : sde_mhd ] ) is able to capture correctly the shape of the pdf of magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "since we considered the kinematic mhd equations in the dynamo regime , the pdf of the stochastic model could not be obtained from a time series as in the case of the passive scalar since the magnetic field is growing exponentially .    to obtain meaningful statistics ensemble averaging",
    "was used instead of time sampling .",
    "numerically , a random initial state was generated and integrated a sufficiently large number of time steps , to retain no statistical influence of the initial state .",
    "the final state enters the statistics and a new realization is generated via another random initial condition .",
    "the pdf was obtained by sampling over @xmath41 initial conditions .    for illustration of the kinematic dynamo effect and a consistency check with direct numerical simulations of the kinematic mhd equations we tracked the local magnetic energy @xmath42 in figure [ fig : dynamo ] for @xmath43 , a value well in the dynamo regime of the modell .",
    "for this simulation only the velocity gradient itself was driven by stochastic forcing , as outlined above , while the magnetic field was undriven .",
    "the forcing amplitude was scaled with @xmath32 , analog to the scaling for a standard random walk .",
    "+ the parameter @xmath14 of the model was chosen to be @xmath44 .",
    "+ the magnetic diffusion time @xmath45 scale is varied to explore the reaction of the dynamo effect . below the critical parameter of approximately @xmath46 we observed no growing magnetic energy .",
    "the corresponding growth rate , estimated from an exponential growth @xmath47 , is about @xmath48 .",
    "the growth rate compares well with the growth rate of our dns simulation , where we obtain @xmath49 .",
    "although the identification of the correct kolmogorov timescale @xmath14 is not without uncertainties , it is remarkable that this value of the growth rate is in the range of data obtained by kinematic dynamo simulations ( see also table i in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the natural extension of the _ recent fluid deformation _ model for navier - stokes turbulence @xcite to the case of fluctuations of the gradient of a passive scalar and to magnetic field fluctuations is able to produce probability distribution functions that agree well with pdfs obtained from direct numerical simulations .",
    "the pdfs from the stochastic odes ( [ eq : final ] , [ eq : sde_ps ] , [ eq : sde_mhd ] ) are obtained with a fraction of the computing resources necessary for direct numerical simulations .",
    "the next step is to include the back - reaction of the magnetic field on the fluid flow .",
    "if this can be managed , then generating magnetic field fluctuations using the _ recent fluid deformation _ model is a tempting alternative for e.g. the problem of cosmic ray propagation where magnetic field fluctuations are generated by other means which are not able to capture intermittency effects ( see @xcite ) .",
