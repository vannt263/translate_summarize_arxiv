    "the study of galaxy populations in high - redshift large - scale structures can give us important clues about the star formation history and galaxy formation process in such environments @xcite .",
    "however , the detection of distant galaxy clusters is not trivial .    at high redshifts ,",
    "the use of techniques like the red - cluster sequence @xcite , is less efficient .",
    "the reason is the proportional decrease of the number of red galaxies in clusters for increasing redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , in order to detect high - z clusters through optical imaging , one requires at least photometric redshift information , which implies imaging in four or more bands . additionally , in order to avoid the high observational cost of observing large areas of the sky , one can use several indicators of the presence of high - z clusters to select the fields to be observed .",
    "several of these tracers , like extended x - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sunyaev - zeldovich decrement or bright radio - emitting galaxies have been largely used to trace clustering of galaxies .",
    "these techniques have strengths and drawbacks .",
    "the first two , for example , depend on the presence of a hot intra - cluster medium , which may bias samples against recently forming clusters . in this paper",
    ", we will consider another possible tracer of the presence of clusters : physically close pairs of quasars .",
    "quasars are relatively rare astronomical objects and hence , if they are distributed following galaxies , the presence of two or more such objects in a relatively small volume should be a good indicator of a rich environment .",
    "actually , in structure formation scenarios with bias between barionic and dark matter distribution @xcite it is expected that high redshift objects form in large high  redshift density fluctuations and , therefore , such correlation between quasar concentration and clusters is somewhat expected , unless , for some reason , quasars avoid clusters .",
    "however , most observational evidence shows that high redshift quasars do tend to follow the overall large scale structures .",
    "whether quasars inhabit or not high density regions in low redshifts is a subject of dispute .",
    "@xcite , for example , claim that at @xmath8 , quasars ( both radio  loud and radio  quiet ) tend to reside in low density regions . on the other hand @xcite , using a sample of x - ray selected quasars , conclude that those objects trace closely the underlying mass distribution . @xcite also points out that @xmath9 quasars follow the large - scale structure traced by galaxy clusters , but they also note the complete absence of radio  quiet qso s at the very center of galaxy clusters .    at higher redshift , however , most observational results suggest that quasars prefer groups or clusters @xcite .",
    "one very convincing example is the structure found by @xcite at @xmath10 around a radio - quiet quasar belonging to a large quasar structure @xcite .",
    "the same behaviour appears to be followed by radio - loud quasars .",
    "a good example is the work by @xcite , who found a highly significant excess of galaxies around radio - loud quasars at @xmath11 . @xcite",
    "also points in the same direction by reporting an overdensity of galaxies around a quasar concentration at @xmath12 .",
    "an exception is the work by @xcite who , through an analysis of the clustering of quasars and galaxies at @xmath13 , concluded that quasars and blue galaxies are found in the same environment , which differs from that occupied by the red galaxy population .",
    "regarding specifically quasar pairs , @xcite found an statistically significant excess of high - redshift quasar pairs with separations between 1 and 5 mpc in projected distance .",
    "this suggests that such quasar pairs belong to sizable physical structures ( precursors of today s clusters and superclusters of galaxies ) and therefore , they can be used as tracers of high - redshift large - scale structures . going to even larger redshifts",
    ", @xcite found that a quasar pair at @xmath14 is associated with a large - scale structure .",
    "thus , an interesting form to search for high - redshift clusters and other large - scale structures is examining the environment inhabited by quasar pairs .    in this work",
    ", we describe a multi - color photometric study of the field around four quasar pairs at @xmath7 , using the instrument gmos in both gemini north and south telescopes .",
    "one of the pairs in our sample , qp0110 - 0219 , has been previously studied by @xcite , who found hints of the presence of a cluster around it .",
    "the new data we present here allow us to confirm this claim .",
    "there are no studies in the literature for the other three quasar pairs .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following : in section 2 we describe the sample and the data reduction procedures .",
    "the galaxy photometry is discussed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 outlines our approach to obtain photometric redshifts and presents then application to our galaxy sample .",
    "the environments of the quasar pairs are discussed in section 5 .",
    "finally , in section 6 we summarize our results . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a @xmath15 concordance cosmology with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and we use the value @xmath18 in the hubble constant , @xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 .",
    "in this paper , we study a sample of four fields around quasar pairs at @xmath7 .",
    "we selected the pairs from @xcite quasar catalog considering redshift differences smaller than 0.01 and projected angular separations smaller than 300 arcsec .",
    "we did not consider pairs with angular separations smaller than 15 arcsecs to avoid including gravitational lens . with these parameters , we found 84 quasar pairs .",
    "five of them had redshifts between 0.9 and 1.0 , and four were observed with gemini telescopes .",
    "the main sample characteristics are shown in table [ car ] .",
    "it includes : the quasar names , their coordinates , redshifts , angular separation , and the name adopted for the pairs in this paper .",
    "we have checked the spectra of the quasars in our sample to certify that we indeed did not pick any cases of gravitationally lensed images of one only quasar .",
    "the parity of qp0110 - 0219  is discussed by @xcite .",
    "considering the redshift difference and spectral characteristics , they conclude that the quasars q 0107 - 0235  and pb 6291  are different objects .",
    "for the other pairs , quasar spectra are available in the 2df qso redshift survey @xcite .",
    "our visual examination of the spectra indicates that also in this case the differences in redshifts and spectral characteristics suggest that they are indeed different objects and not lensed images of the same quasar .",
    "moreover , in qp1310 + 0007 , qp1355 - 0032 , and qp0110 - 0219  one of the quasars is radio - loud and the other is radio - quiet .",
    "consequently , we are confident that none of the pairs in our sample are produced by gravitational lensing .      the four fields in table [ car ] were observed with gmos n and s mounted on gemini telescopes .",
    "the imaging was done in four filters of the sdss system @xcite : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "the log of observations is presented in table [ obs2 ] , which shows the telescope used , the exposure time , and the gemini program identification number .",
    "all observations were performed in photometric conditions .",
    "the typical fwhm for point sources was @xmath0 0.7 arcsec in all images .",
    "data reduction was performed using the gemini iraf package .",
    "the images were bias corrected , flat fielded , and fringe corrected in the standard way . after that , they were combined and cleaned of cosmic ray events and bad pixels producing , then , the final images , appropriate for science analysis .",
    "we have used the iraf package _ daophot _ to calculate the photometric zero - point for each band in each field in the ab sdss photometric system .",
    "the calibration was made using stars from the landolt catalog @xcite also calibrated in the ab sdss system . using the dispersion in the magnitudes of the stars ,",
    "we have estimated the accuracy of the magnitude zero - point as 0.01 in @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands , 0.02 in @xmath3 band , and 0.03 in @xmath4 band .",
    "we have used sextractor @xcite to detect objects over the final image frames .",
    "first , we ran the program on the images of each photometric band and selected the image that showed the highest number of detected objects .",
    "second , using such image as reference , we ran the program again in `` dual image mode '' .",
    "we used a top - hat filter and detected objects above 1.5 @xmath21 , which corresponded to median isophotal levels of 27.1 , 26.4 , 26.4 , and 25.4 mag arcsec@xmath22 in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , respectively . in order to run the program in `` dual image mode ''",
    ", it was necessary to align the images .",
    "thus , because of rotations and shifts , parts of the images near the borders were lost .    positions and magnitudes ( total and aperture ) were obtained for all objects present in all bands for each pair .",
    "we adopted 3 arcsec aperture magnitudes , @xmath23 , to measure colors .",
    "aperture magnitudes were also obtined to compare our data with others in the literature . for the total magnitude of an object",
    ", we have addopted a color corrected isophotal magnitude .",
    "for example , if the objects were detected in the g band , then @xmath24 , @xmath25 , etc . , where @xmath26 is the isophotal magnitude given by sextractor .",
    "after measuring the magnitudes they were corrected for galaxy extinction , with the absorption coefficients @xmath27 obtained from @xcite using ned and interpolated to gmos bands .    we have used the class - star parameter of sextractor , which ranges from 0 ( galaxies ) to 1 ( stars ) , to separate stars from galaxies .",
    "figure [ cs ] shows this parameter versus the @xmath3 magnitude for the pair qp0110 - 0219 .",
    "the star symbol in the plot represents all objects with fwhm @xmath28 seeing . if we consider all objects with class - star @xmath29 0.8 as galaxies , a threshold often adopted in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find that 2 % of the objects with fwhm @xmath28 seeing have class - star @xmath29 0.8 and that 7 % of the objects with fwhm @xmath30 seeing have class - star @xmath31 0.8 .",
    "on the other hand , if we adopt a threshold of 0.9 , we have a similar contamination ( @xmath02 % ) of the galaxy sample and only 4 % of the objects with fwhm @xmath30 seeing have now class - star @xmath31 0.9 .",
    "the results for the other fields are similar .",
    "we then decided to adopt the class - star value of 0.9 to separate stars from galaxies .",
    "the same criteria was adopted by @xcite to determine number counts in the hhdfn .    in order to estimate the completeness magnitude of the observations",
    ", we have ploted the logarithmic number of detected objects as a function of the total magnitude in the band used for detection . from visual inspection of the turnover magnitudes",
    ", we estimated that the observations are complete down to @xmath3 = 24 for qp1310 + 0007  and qp0110 - 0219 , @xmath1 = 25 for qp1355 - 0032 , and @xmath1 = 24.5 for qp0114 - 3140 .",
    "it is interesting to know how the magnitudes above compare with those of a @xmath32-galaxy at the redshift of the pairs .",
    "we have estimated the value @xmath32 in two ways , as follows .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath33 for clusters of galaxies with redshifts between 0.8 and 1.0 . considering the value for @xmath34 obtained by @xcite for the cluster 3c 184 ( @xmath35 )",
    ", we have @xmath36 . on the other hand , using spectrophotometric synthesis models , @xcite obtained @xmath37 for galaxies at @xmath38 .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath39 . in the second case",
    ", we may consider the coma cluster as representative of a @xmath40 cluster .",
    "@xcite studied its luminosity function and found @xmath41 .",
    "for galaxies at @xmath40 , @xcite obtained @xmath42 and @xmath43 , therefore @xmath44 for the cosmology adopted here .",
    "we have calculated @xmath45 with @xmath46 + 25 + k(z ) + e(z)\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the luminosity distance , @xmath48 is the k - correction and @xmath49 is the evolution correction . in the cosmology adopted here , @xmath50 at @xmath7 . using @xmath48 and @xmath49 values published by @xcite and @xcite respectively ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) and the value obtained to @xmath53 at @xmath40 , we obtain @xmath54 . considering the uncertainties of the approaches , the agreement of the two values is very good .",
    "we have then adopted the mean value @xmath55 .",
    "this value is similar to that obtained by @xcite ( @xmath56 ab ) for early - type galaxies at @xmath57 .",
    "this result shows that the completeness magnitude of our fields corresponds to @xmath58 at the redshift of the pairs .",
    "our approach to compute photometric redshifts (  [ zphot ] ) makes use of a training set with galaxies of known redshifts measured in the same photometric bands .",
    "consequently , photometric redshifts are very sensitive to small zero - point changes . in order to examine this point ,",
    "we have made a comparison between our photometry with those available for the hhdfn ( hawaii hubble deep field north ) region @xcite and for the acs - goods ( advanced camera for surveys - great observatories origins deep survey ) region @xcite .",
    "although one region is contained in the other , the photometric and spectroscopic data available for them are different .",
    "a comparison with hhdfn is useful because it contains acs - goods and has a photometric completeness similar to those of our fields .",
    "acs - goods , on the other hand , has hundreds of mesured spectroscopic redshifts and will be adopted as the training set for our photometric redshift method . since the photometry of these fields ( in ubvriz@xmath59 ) is diferent of our photometry ( in @xmath60 ) , they were interpolated to the gmos bands adopted here .",
    "first we have considered the hhdfn region which has photometry complete down to @xmath61 .",
    "we compared the photometric distribution of galaxies in our fields within the magnitude completeness limit of each band with the corresponding distributions using the interpolated magnitudes .",
    "we estimated the shift that is required in the zero - point of our photometric bands so that the median of the magnitude distribution ( for galaxies brighther than the completeness limit ) of hhdfn and ours match each other .",
    "we have used an iterative algorithm , adding to our magnitudes a shift obtained in each step until convergence .",
    "the median of the absolute value of the shifts is 0.07 .",
    "many are the possible sources of these shifts .",
    "a possibility is the magnitude interpolation required in this approach .",
    "another one is cosmic variance , since the galaxy catalogues considered here are not large enough .",
    "indeed , a photometric study with sdss data made by @xcite shows that , besides galaxy extinction , the principal cause for variations in number counts is the large - scale clustering of galaxies .",
    "this dispersion increases for smaller areas , being greater than 0.2 magnitudes for areas smaller than 0.01 @xmath62 , as is our case .",
    "after appling the zero - point shifts in our magnitudes , we compared our galaxy number counts with those from the acs - goods data in 0.5 mag intervals for objects brighter than the apperture magnitude @xmath63",
    ". it can be verified that , for all fields , we obtain a good match between our number counts and those of acs - goods .",
    "determining the redshifts of the galaxies in our fields allows us to separate the galaxies belonging to a possible cluster or group at the redshift of the pair from the foreground and/or background galaxies .",
    "here we adopt photometric redshifts for this task .",
    "photometric redshift estimation is often done by comparing the magnitudes of an object with the magnitudes of templates obtained with spectrophotometric evolution models , as is the case of zpeg @xcite and hyperz @xcite .",
    "here we adopt another approach : instead of a galaxy model , we use real data- magnitudes and spectroscopic redshifts- obtained in galaxy surveys .",
    "we compare the magnitudes of our galaxies with magnitudes in the same bands of real galaxies with known spectroscopic redshift to parametrize a local empirical relationship between magnitudes or colors with redshift .",
    "this is done using a locally weighted regression algorithm ( lwr ) developed by our group ( santos et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "the same type of data - driven approach is adopted in the annz photometric redshift package @xcite , which applies instead artificial neural networks for this task .",
    "lwr is an algorithm designed to provide a continuous non - linear mapping between sets of variables ( e.g. , atkeson , moore & schall 1997 ) .",
    "our lwr method is discussed in detail and compared with other methods in santos et al .",
    "( 2007 , in prep . ) .",
    "here we only outline its main characteristics .",
    "the method works with magnitudes or colors ( and even with other galaxy properties , like diameter or type ) but here we use colors .",
    "the method works with two data sets : the training set ( having known spectroscopic redshifts ) and the test set ( for which we want to calculate the redshift ) .",
    "obviously , both sets must have the magnitudes and/or colors measured in the same bands and in the same photometric system .",
    "lwr establishes a linear relationship between colors and redshifts that is local because the redshift estimation in a given point in color space weights more heavily the data points in the neighborhood of this point than those more distant .",
    "the training set contains colors and spectroscopic redshift for all objects . from these values",
    "we build a redshift estimator which will be applied to our galaxies , in the test set .",
    "we assume that the local relation between colors and redshifts is linear : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a vector containing the @xmath66 colors of a given object , @xmath67 is the redshift and @xmath68 stands for transpose matrix . for each object in the test set , with colors in point @xmath65 , we determine the values of coefficients @xmath69 and then the redshift by minimizing the weighted @xmath70 function with the @xmath71 objects of the training set : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the weight associated to the @xmath74th data point .",
    "the locality of the fitting is assured by adopting a weight function which decreases as the euclidean distance @xmath75 between points @xmath65 and @xmath76 increases : @xmath77 the @xmath78 parameter is a kernel - width that determines the `` effective volume '' around point @xmath65 : only points within this sphere effectively affect the values of the parameters and the redshift estimate .",
    "this parameter was determined in this work by dividing randomly the training set objects in 2/3 for training ( ts ) and 1/3 for validation ( vs ) . for galaxies in vs we computed @xmath79 with eq .",
    "[ lin ] using galaxies in ts to obtain the coefficients .",
    "this procedure was then repeated one hundred times . for each realization of ts and vs ,",
    "we compute the rms square deviation between @xmath79 and @xmath80 for the objects in vs , @xmath81 , and choose as optimal @xmath78 the value for which @xmath81 is minimum .",
    "it is worth mentioning that redshift estimates with the lwr method are heavily dependent on the training set adopted ( besides , of course , the set of colors available ) . in particular , the redshift accuracy increases with the size of the training set and depends strongly on the homogeneity of the photometric calibration of the training and test sets .",
    "we adopt in this work the ( interpolated ) photometric data and spectroscopic redshifts of the acs - goods region as our training set .",
    "since the method allows using colors or magnitudes for photometric redshift estimation , we have used colors ( but none of the results reported in the next section depend of this choice ) . using magnitudes we would have to limit our sample at @xmath63 ( the acs - goods spectroscopic completeness ) , but our sample photometry goes deeper",
    "; it is complete at least down to @xmath82 .",
    "when we use colors , such limit is not necessary and we are able to estimate photometric redshifts for fainter objects , even without spectroscopic data for @xmath83 .",
    "the value @xmath84 was determined by the procedure described in the previous section as the median value of 100 simulations .",
    "the histogram in figure [ zph ] shows the redshift error distribution for all simulations . in what follows",
    "we consider the mean value , @xmath85 , as the redshift error for the training set acs - goods .",
    "figure [ zph ] also shows the comparison between @xmath79 and @xmath80 for the 1/3 of galaxies from acs - goods used for validation corresponding to the simulation with this mean value .",
    "having obtained photometric redshifts for all fields containing quasar pairs , we may start looking for structures around the redshift of the pairs , that is , objects with @xmath86 .",
    "we made experiments with @xmath87 equal to 0.1 , 0.16 and 0.2 , obtaining similar results .",
    "therefore we only present here results with @xmath88 . for comparison , @xcite , in a photometric study of the galaxy cluster mg2016 + 112 at @xmath89 , adopted @xmath90 .",
    "note that the error @xmath81 should depend of the photometric errors , the number of colors , and the size of the training set .",
    "we present in figure [ dr ] the galaxy redshift distribution in the field of each quasar pair .",
    "all fields show a peak in the interval @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "we now analyse some properties of the galaxy distribution in this redshift interval aiming at constraining the nature of the environment inhabited by the quasar pairs of our sample .",
    "we must know the expected number of galaxies in this interval , to verify the significance of the galaxy excess around @xmath92 .",
    "for this estimate we have assumed that the hhdfn region is representative of the overall galaxy distribution .",
    "this sample is appropriate for this analysis because its photometric depth is comparable to that of our fields .",
    "photometric redshifts were obtained with the method discussed in the previous section .",
    "we then defined the galaxy overdensity in the interval @xmath93 as @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the number densities of galaxies in this redshift interval for a given field and for the hhdfn , respectively .",
    "we have considered as galaxies in hhdfn all objects with @xmath97 .",
    "values of @xmath98 for each pair are shown in table [ prop ] .",
    "errors in @xmath98 were determined assuming poissonian errors for @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the overdensity @xmath98 ranges from 0.6 to 1.6 and is significant in all cases .",
    "note that these results are affected by cosmic variance , since we have used only one reference field and the area occupied by hhdfn ( 0.2 square degrees ) is very small , so that @xmath101 is affected by the galaxy clustering in the hhdfn region .",
    "we have arrived at similar results using the vimos vlt deep survey around the chandra deep field south @xcite and the gemini deep deep survey @xcite regions .      in order to investigate the clustering properties of the galaxies in the chosen redshift interval around a quasar pair , we calculated the median projected distance between galaxies and compared them with the same quantities obtained with 1000 simulations of random uniform galaxy distributions with the same number of objects and the same projected area of the observed fields .",
    "we may then define a confidence level , @xmath102 , that a field presents a galaxy distribution more clustered than an uniform distribution :    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is the number of simulated fields with median projected distances larger than that of the observed fields and @xmath105 is the total number of simulations .",
    "we summarize the results of this analysis in table [ prop ] .",
    "two pairs are strongly clustered ( qp1355 - 0032 , qp0110 - 0219 ) , one is moderately clustered ( qp1310 + 0007 ) and one ( qp0114 - 3140 ) is not clustered at all .      in order to estimate the richness of our fields , we have adopted an approach similar to the traditional abell s richness criterion @xcite , defined as the number of galaxies brighter than @xmath106 ( where @xmath107 is the magnitude of the third brightest cluster member ) within a radius of @xmath108 mpc of the cluster center . a cluster is considered rich if it contains more than 30 galaxies according to such a definition .",
    "the abell s radius considering the cosmological model adopted here is 2.1 mpc . assuming that the brightest galaxy in the redshift interval @xmath109 is the brightest cluster galaxy , we computed the number of galaxies brighter than @xmath110 by scaling their number in each field to the abell area ( @xmath111 , where @xmath112 ) .",
    "this result was corrected for contamination due to background / foreground objects using counts in the hhdfn region .",
    "the results are shown in table [ prop ] .",
    "all but one of the putative clusters are rich , according with this criterion .",
    "the field of qp1310 + 0007  seems to be the poorest of our four fields , and is poor also with abell s criterion .",
    "however , this is the pair with the brightest galaxy in the corresponding redshift interval among all quasar pairs , and its poorness may be an effect of galaxy counts , since they grow strongly for increasing magnitude .",
    "furthermore , note that our fields are smaller than the abell s radius , then the quasars could be in a poor cluster , group , or in the neighborhood of a cluster . on the other hand ,",
    "the pair qp0114 - 3140 , which is not rich by the results of sections 5.1 and 5.2 , has r=0 in abell s classification .",
    "it is , then , appropriate to look for other richness estimators to confirm or not these results .",
    "another useful richness indicator is the number of bright galaxies , assumed here as those brighter than @xmath113 present in the field .",
    "this number is estimated for galaxies in the pair redshift interval and is corrected with the corresponding hhdfn counts ( scaled to the field area ) .",
    "the results are also presented in table [ prop ] .",
    "all fields seems to contain a considerable number of bright galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with those obtained by @xcite .",
    "these authors studied a variety of abell - like richness indicators in an i - band cluster survey .",
    "one of these indicators , @xmath114 , is defined as the number of galaxies with magnitude between @xmath115 and @xmath116 within a radius of 666 @xmath117 @xmath118 .",
    "they show that this indicator is related to abell s richness , @xmath119 , as @xmath120 .",
    "we have used this relation to estimate abell s richness from @xmath114 . for 31 clusters with redshifts between 0.9 and 1.0 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath121 galaxies .",
    "that means that fields have a richness @xmath122 , which may be compared with the numbers present in table [ prop ] : only qp1310 + 0007  seems poorer than the clusters at comparable redshift studied by @xcite .",
    "the red sequence is a characteristic of the color - magnitude diagrams of early - type galaxies of groups and clusters . in a color - magnitude diagram",
    "these galaxies have very similar colors following a linear relation and their integrated colors are progressively bluer for weaker magnitudes .",
    "this relation is also known as color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) .",
    "we have examined the red sequence in the @xmath123 diagram of galaxies in the redshift interval of each pair .",
    "the use of the color @xmath124 is based on its capability to identify early - type galaxies , since at @xmath7 the 4000    break lies in the @xmath3 band and consequently the early - type galaxy color @xmath124 are very red . the fields around quasar pairs qp1310 + 0007  and qp0110 - 0219  ( figures [ cla ] and [ clc ] - top - right ) present a peak in the color distribution at @xmath125 .",
    "comparing our data with a similar distribution for hhdfn , we verify that these peaks represent an excess of 1.7 @xmath21 and 3.3 @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "therefore , in this interval , we would expect to find a red sequence in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "indeed , for qp0110 - 0219   we note clearly that the galaxies form a red sequence in @xmath126 ( figure [ clc ] - top - left ) , the value obtained by @xcite in spectroscopically confirmed structures at @xmath127 . besides , if we consider the projected distribution of these red - sequence galaxies ( figure [ clc ] - bottom ) , we notice that they have a filamentary - like distribution similar to what is observed in other @xmath7 clusters , and considered typical of clusters in process of formation ( e.g. , toft et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the red galaxies of qp1310 + 0007   present a broad distribution in the color - magnitude diagram ( figure [ cla ] - top - left ) . they also present a clump - like projected distribution ( figure [ cla ] - bottom ) .",
    "the other two fields have less - significant red sequences ( figures [ clb ] and [ cld ] ) .",
    "the cluster cl1604 + 4321 , at @xmath128 , the less massive of the clusters studied by @xcite , presents a lack of bright elliptical galaxies ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "the authors suggest that this cluster has not yet had time to complete the red sequence .",
    "this may be also the case for the structures associated to qp1355 - 0032  and qp0114 - 3140 .",
    "the properties of the environment associated with each quasar pair are summarized in table [ resumo ] .",
    "we now discuss each pair individually .",
    "this quasar pair is formed by j131046 + 0006  ( a radio - quiet object ) and j131055 + 0008  ( a radio - loud quasar ) at redshifts 0.925 and 0.933 , respectively .",
    "they have an angular separation of 177 arcsec , corresponding to 1.4 mpc in the adopted cosmology .",
    "its density contrast is the smallest among all quasar pairs .",
    "however , the galaxy distribution analysis shows that the galaxies in this field are clustered at some degree , i.e. , the median projected distance between galaxies is smaller than in a random uniform field in 67 % of the simulations .",
    "this field has been classified as poor with the abell s criterion , and we have found 20 galaxies with magnitude @xmath130 . the galaxy color distribution shows a prominent peak in @xmath131 , corresponding to the red sequence .",
    "the red galaxies present a clumpy distribution , but without central condensation .",
    "the presence of a significant amount of early - type galaxies plus the relative poorness of this field indicate that this can be the seed of a structure that can became a rich galaxy cluster at @xmath132 .",
    "j135457 - 0034  and j135504 - 0030  constitute this pair ; the first is radio - loud and the second is radio - quiet .",
    "the projected separation between them is 252 arcsec , or 2.0 mpc , with redshifts 0.932 and 0.934 , respectively .",
    "the redshift interval @xmath93 shows the largest galaxy excess among all quasar pairs discussed in this work .",
    "the median projected distance between galaxies resulted smaller than in a random uniform field in 98.5 % of the cases , meaning that these galaxias are strongly clustered .",
    "this is the richest field in our sample accordingly to abell s criterion and also the one with the largest number of bright galaxies ( @xmath130 ) , however its red sequence is modest and the red galaxies do not present a clustered distribution .",
    "its richness and number of bright galaxies are the major indications that this quasar pair is probably in a galaxy cluster .",
    "this quasar pair is formed by a radio - loud quasar ( q 0107 - 0235 ) and a radio - quiet quasar ( pb",
    "6291 ) at redshifts 0.958 and 0.956 , respectively .",
    "the angular separation of 77 arcsec ( 0.6 mpc ) is the smallest of the sample .",
    "the overdensity in the redshift interval is significant as for the other pairs .",
    "the galaxy distribution is the most clustered of all samples , accordingly to the cl values in table [ prop ] .",
    "the field is rich by abell s criterion , but presents only 12 bright galaxies .",
    "the red sequence is clearly present in the color - magnitude diagram at @xmath126 .",
    "the red galaxies present a filamentary - like distribution and there is a galaxy excess around the radio - loud quasar .",
    "these results indicate that qp0110 - 0219  is indeed a rich cluster .",
    "moreover , we have verified that qp0110 - 0219  has been serendipitously detected ( but unreported ) in x - ray with a pointed _ rosat _ pspc observation of 6.6  ks .",
    "we have estimated the bolometric x - ray luminosity assuming that all detected flux ( background corrected ) comes from the icm : @xmath133ergs  s@xmath20 .",
    "such luminosity is well above a typical cluster x - ray luminosity and may be contaminated by the x - ray emission from one or both quasars . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical quasar x - ray luminosity [ 210 kev ] is around @xmath134erg  s@xmath20 , thus the quasars in the pair may not account for all x - ray emission . besides , the total emission [ 0.58.0 kev ] within 3 arcmin is about 10 times higher than the typical quasar emission in this band ; therefore the observed x - ray flux is consistent with emission from quasars and a possible cluster around them .",
    "this is the single pair in our sample detected in x - rays so far .",
    "the other fields were not detected in the rosat all sky survey , nor in the pointed observations .",
    "this pair is formed by radio - quiet quasars .",
    "j011441 - 3139  has @xmath135 and j011446 - 3141  has @xmath136 .",
    "the separation between them is 144 arcsec ( 1.1 mpc ) .",
    "this field shows a significant overdensity , no clustering , and no red sequence .",
    "it also seems rich with abell s criterion and has a comparatively large number of bright galaxies .",
    "the evidence for the presence of a rich cluster at the redshift of the quasar pair is not as compelling in this case , compared with the other 3 pairs .",
    "we have studied the environment traced by quasar pairs at @xmath7 , using images in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 bands obtained with gmos at gemini north and south . in order to identify galaxies in a redshift interval close to that of the quasar pairs",
    ", we have estimated photometric redshifts with the lwr method , using acs - goods data as a training set .",
    "the rms dispersion of the difference between our photometric redshift and the spectroscopic redshift in the training set is @xmath85 .",
    "we have adopted the interval @xmath137",
    "@xmath138 @xmath81 for the analysis of the pair environment .",
    "we investigated the clustering of the galaxies near the pair by estimating a confidence level , @xmath102 , that the galaxies are more concentrated than in a uniform distribution .",
    "we have also estimated the richness of each redshift interval with a variant of abell s criterion , as well as by the number of bright galaxies .",
    "we verified whether a red sequence is present and the form of the projected distribution of red galaxies .",
    "the analysis indicates that probably three out of our four quasar pairs are members of galaxy custers . for one of the pairs we did not find strong evidence for it : qp0114 - 3140   could be in a poor cluster , group , or in the neighborhood of a cluster , since our fields are lesser than abell s radius .",
    "taken at face value , this result shows that quasar pairs are indeed good tracers of the large scale structure at high @xmath139 .",
    "however , with only four quasar pairs in our sample we are not able to say at what level targeting a quasar pair increases the probability of finding a rich galaxy cluster as compared to targeting a single quasar .",
    "a study of larger and homogeneous samples would be necessary to clarify this point .",
    "an extension of our work to other redshifts may be also useful and may provide interesting clues on the evolution of large - scale structure and galaxy clustering .",
    "this work is based on observations obtained at the gemini observatory , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
    ", under a cooperative agreement with the nsf on behalf of the gemini partnership : the national science foundation ( united states ) , the particle physics and astronomy research council ( united kingdom ) , the national research council ( canada ) , conicyt ( chile ) , the australian research council ( australia ) , cnpq ( brazil ) and conicet ( argentina ) .",
    "we would like to thank the gemini staff for obtaining the observations in queue mode .",
    "we also thank g. b. lima neto for many useful discussions , and the anonymous referee , whose comments helped to improve this paper .",
    "we are grateful for the support provided by the brazilian agencies cnpq and fapesp .",
