    "these accretion outbursts are thought to be linked to the evolution of protoplanetary disks .",
    "in fact , the inner region of the disk directly feeds the central star , and both its energy budget and its chemistry are modified by high - energy radiation such as that generated by accretion shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "a theoretical picture of episodic accretion in exors is emerging in which mass accumulates outside the star - disk corotation radius until the surface density increases enough to overcome the centrifugal barrier , perturbing the magnetospheric radius inward of corotation and bringing the inner disk into a high - accretion phase until the built - up material is depleted @xcite . determining the amount and extent of gas in the inner disk before , during , and after an outburst can therefore provide unique constraints to episodic accretion models and help understand the basic physics governing the evolution of inner regions in accreting protoplanetary disks .    in this paper",

    "ex lupi is a 13myr old t tauri star with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and spectral type m0 @xcite , at a distance of 155 pc in the lupus complex @xcite .",
    "it is the prototypical exor variable @xcite , where the record of episodic accretion flares dates back to 1901 @xcite . in 2008 the strongest outburst on record occurred with a 5 mag increase in the v band ( figure [ fig : proposal ] ) . on that occasion , ex lupi",
    "was observed over a broad wavelength range from the x - ray and uv @xcite , to the optical @xcite and the infrared @xcite using a plethora of telescopes . with this work ,",
    "we build upon the heritage of nir observations taken in 2008 . using new nir spectroscopy obtained in 2014 , we find that the inner disk is depleted by one order of magnitude in molecular gas mass , unveiling a forest of stellar photosphere lines at 3@xmath0 m .",
    "we present velocity - resolved infrared spectroscopy of ex lupi using the cryogenic infrared echelle spectrometer ( crires , * ? ? ?",

    "new data were taken in april 2014 , covering the spectral regions 2.913.07@xmath0 m and 4.664.89@xmath0 m ( program 093.c-0432 ) .",
    "similar spectral regions had been observed during the accretion outburst in 2008 , in april ( 2.912.99@xmath0 m ) and in august ( 4.664.90 @xmath0 m ) , as part of the eso large program 179.c-0151 @xcite . in this work , we compare spectral regions common to the two epochs : 2.912.96@xmath0 m ( henceforth referred to as the 3@xmath0 m setting ) and 4.664.89@xmath0 m ( henceforth referred to as the 5@xmath0 m setting ) .",

    "the slit width was @xmath9 , providing spectral resolution of @xmath10kms@xmath2 , and the on - source integration time was 20 min per spectral setting .",
    "early - type telluric standard stars were observed at similar airmasses to ex lupi ( typically within 0.05 , and always less than 0.1 difference ) : hr5812 at 3@xmath0 m , bs6175 and hr5984 at 5@xmath0 m .",
    "the data were reduced applying procedures developed for the eso large program 179.c-0151 , as described in @xcite .",
    "the spectra were photometrically calibrated using the telluric standards as spectrophotometric references , achieving a precision of @xmath11% of the absolute fluxes ( including flux uncertainties from the standard stars and variable atmospheric and slit transmission at the time of observations ) .",
    "we find that the continuum in ex lupi decreased from @xmath12 jy in april 2008 to @xmath13 jy in april 2014 at 3@xmath0 m , and from @xmath14 jy to @xmath15 jy at 5@xmath0 m .",
    "together with a decrease in the continuum flux level , the nir veiling decreased from 2008 to 2014 .",
    "the crires spectra of ex lupi obtained in 2014 show a moderately veiled stellar photosphere that was not previously detectable in outburst ( figure [ fig : proposal ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the veiling ( @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the equivalent width of photospheric lines ) by comparison to a reference spectrum of a main sequence standard star of similar spectral type . the standard star spectrum ( hip49986 , m2v ) was obtained using crires and the same instrumental setup as for ex lupi .",

    "while an additional veiling measurement at 2@xmath0 m is needed to improve the fit , we find the 35@xmath0 m excess flux to be best represented by a temperature of @xmath22 1200k , consistent with the lower end of values found in other t tauri systems ( 1200 - 1800k , * ? ? ?",

    "we characterize the line profile of the different velocity components by stacking co lines between p3 and p18 to increase the signal - to - noise ratio . the number of lines we included in the average depends on the spectral coverage obtained , interrupted by detector chip gaps and telluric absorption , and on the level of contamination from higher vibrational levels . in 2008 ,",
    "neighboring lines from higher vibrational levels build up signal on top of the continuum at both sides of the stacked @xmath24 line profile , as seen in figure [ fig : line_width ] .",
    "we fit for the width , velocity separation , and peak flux ratio of two gaussian functions in the broad co @xmath26 lines .",

    "an additional gaussian needs to be included in absorption in 2008 to account for lack of emission at the blue side of @xmath24 lines ; this blue - shifted absorption in ex lupi had already been found by @xcite , who attributed it to a disk wind developed during the outburst .",
    "we measure a full width at half maximum of @xmath22160 and 140kms@xmath2 for the broad component , and of @xmath22 30 and 45kms@xmath2 for the narrow component in 2008 and 2014 respectively .",

    "we include all measurable co @xmath24 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 line fluxes in the fits .",
    "we fix the vibrational temperature to the rotational temperature , and find reduced chisquare values @xmath34 under this assumption .",
    "we find that both velocity components decrease in column density and emitting area from 2008 to 2014 , by a factor of 2 and 38 , respectively ( table[tab : conf_lim ] and figure [ fig : chi2_lim ] ) .",

    "the h@xmath3o spectrum is comparable to that seen in a few other t tauri systems so far @xcite , although higher vibrational states are populated and the lines are significantly broader , therefore suffering a greater degree of blending .",
    "we apply the best - fit temperature and area found for the broad co component to h@xmath3o and oh emission , and to model the 3@xmath0 m spectrum we need column density ratios of co / h@xmath3o@xmath71 and oh / h@xmath3o@xmath72 , in the range found by @xcite in other disks .",
    "the broad co component and the h@xmath3o and oh gas therefore may have undergone the same depletion and cooling from 2008 to 2014 , explaining the disappearance of line emission at 3@xmath0 m .",
    "from the evolution in nir co emission observed by comparison of crires spectra of ex lupi , we estimated that @xmath38 in the inner disk decreased by one order of magnitude from august 2008 to april 2014 .",
    "ex lupi underwent a major accretion event in 2008 , when the accretion rate onto the star increased by two orders of magnitude to @xmath41@xmath73m@xmath5yr@xmath2 ( figure [ fig : proposal ] , and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the system spends most of its time in a quiescent state with a much lower accretion rate @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated from monitoring of the h@xmath74 10% width that before and after the 2008 outburst ex lupi had a similar low accretion rate of @xmath75m@xmath5yr@xmath2 .",
    "if the 2014 data show the typical conditions of the quiescent system , what we measure is a higher gas mass in the inner disk during outburst ( 2008 ) by comparison to quiescence .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the current view of episodic accretion in young stars ( see e.g. review by * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , one set of models have been shown to be relevant for the timescales and strengths of exor outbursts @xcite . in these models ,",
    "when the inner disk of a t tauri star is truncated by the stellar magnetosphere outside ( but close to ) the corotation radius @xmath76 , the accretion rate onto the star is inhibited and gas accumulates beyond @xmath76 . when the surface density becomes large enough to overcome the centrifugal barrier , the magnetospheric radius @xmath77 is perturbed inward of @xmath76 and accretion onto the star can proceed vigorously until the gas reservoir is emptied , eventually causing @xmath77 to migrate outward of @xmath76 again into a low - accretion phase .",
    "@xcite showed that this accumulation - release behavior can lead to excursions in the accretion rate of about two orders of magnitude and outburst duration of months , consistent with observations of ex lupi ( see cartoon in figure [ fig : proposal ] ) . using the definition in @xcite , the radius @xmath77 where the dipolar field in the stellar magnetosphere truncates the disk in ex lupi",
    "should be located at 0.2 - 0.3 au in 2014 and at 0.03 - 0.06 in 2008 ( adopting a magnetic field strength between 1 and 3 kg as appropriate for t tauri stars , * ? ? ?",
    "the corotation radius , where the disk rotation equals the stellar rotation , is instead at @xmath78au or outward at @xmath79au ( estimated using a stellar @xmath80 and @xmath81kms@xmath2 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "although all these estimates are uncertain , the conditions for the @xcite model may therefore be found in ex lupi , as @xmath77 is larger than @xmath76 in 2014 ( when accretion onto the star is inhibited ) and smaller than @xmath76 during outburst ( when the accretion instead proceeds vigorously ) .",
    "the broad co component traces the region at and inward of @xmath76 , as found by @xcite for co emission in other t tauri disks ; in the @xcite scenario , the increase in gas mass by an order of magnitude would measure the release of gas when @xmath77 approaches @xmath76 .",
    "the narrow co component , instead , may probe the gas accumulation / feeding region beyond @xmath76 .",
    "indeed , during the outburst @xmath82 approaches unity , while in 2014 @xmath38 is just sufficient to feed a quiescent accretion rate of @xmath83m@xmath5yr@xmath2 .",
    "@xmath77 in 2014 is very similar to @xmath28 of the narrow co lines , and may explain the reason of two physically separated emission components as due to the inner disk truncation by the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "an @xmath84 for the broad component in 2014 may present an inconsistency with this picture , unless @xmath77 can be put to 0.02au by the combination of dipolar and octupolar field components @xcite . to test the validity of this interpretation of the co emission seen in ex lupi , future monitoring should measure a steady gas mass from the co broad component ( until the next outburst occurs ) and an increasing gas mass in the narrow component as gas accumulates during quiescence .",
    "monitoring variations in the nir co emission observed from exors could provide unique tests of episodic accretion models .",
    "ex lupi should also be discussed in the context of similarly young ( 1 - 5 myr ) disks . in figure",
    "[ fig : discussion ] we compare the gas properties as measured from nir co emission in ex lupi to individual values found in other young disks by @xcite , who used methods comparable to those used in this work .",
    "we include in the figure both co velocity components from ex lupi , although a multi - component analysis has not been performed yet in other disks .",
    "the narrow co emission in ex lupi shows properties well within those found in other disks , while the broad emission lies at the lower extreme in @xmath28 values . in 2008 , the gas in ex lupi reached masses consistent with those of classical t tauri disks . in 2014 , instead , ex lupi lies within the systematically lower values found in  transitional \" and circumbinary disks , i.e. disks that show dissipation of gas and dust outward of the dust sublimation radius .",
    "an inner dust radius larger than sublimation has been proposed for ex lupi by @xcite and @xcite , at a location consistent with @xmath28 of the narrow co lines ( 0.20.3au ) , and a close - in ( 0.06au ) low - mass ( @xmath85m@xmath86 ) binary companion has been recently claimed by @xcite .",
    "conclusive evidence is still awaited , and our findings raise questions on ex lupi that may apply to episodically accreting t tauri systems in general . does a link exist between accretion outbursts and the dissipation status of inner disks ? is ex lupi a classical t tauri system that resembles a transitional disk in its inner disk gas properties , or a transitional disk that looks classical only during accretion outbursts ? as a step toward answering such questions , we have found that high - resolution infrared spectroscopy of molecular gas helps to determine the dissipation and evolution of inner disks , even in regimes where these are insufficient to produce significant signatures in the broad - band spectral energy distribution .",
