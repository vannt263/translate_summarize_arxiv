    "nuclear matter at high energy density has been extensively studied through high energy heavy - ion collisions.@xcite the primary goal of these studies is to observe the possible phase transition from hadronic matter to quark - gluon plasma ( qgp),@xcite in which quarks and gluons are deconfined over an extended region .",
    "it is believed that the qgp state existed in the early universe shortly after the big bang , and may still exist in the cores of today s neutron stars.@xcite    if a qgp is created in a heavy - ion collision , the collision system will experience the states from deconfined quarks and gluons to interacting hadrons to , finally , freeze - out particles where the measurements are realized . in order to extract the information about the quark - gluon stage of heavy - ion collisions , systematic studies of multi - observables at freeze - out as a function of collision system size and bombarding energy are",
    "necessary.@xcite these observables include strangeness and antibaryon production .",
    "enhancement in strangeness production in high energy heavy - ion collisions over elementary nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions has been proposed as a signature of qgp formation.@xcite the idea is that , in the deconfined qgp , strange quark pairs ( @xmath0 ) can be copiously produced through gluon - gluon fusion ( @xmath1),@xcite while in the hadronic gas , @xmath0 pairs have to be produced via pairs of strange hadrons with higher production thresholds .",
    "moreover , the time scale of the gluon - gluon fusion process is short , on the order of 13  fm.@xcite on the other hand , it is argued that strangeness production rate in a chemically equilibrated hadronic gas might be as high as that in a qgp.@xcite however , the time needed for a hadronic gas system to reach chemical equilibrium is significantly longer  @xcite than the typical life time of a heavy - ion reaction of the order of 10  fm .",
    "in addition to the enhanced production of strangeness , production of strange and multistrange antibaryons should be further enhanced in qgp  @xcite under finite baryon density .",
    "the argument can be made in the simple fermi energy - level picture as the following .",
    "low energy levels of light quarks ( @xmath2 ) are already occupied by the excessive light quarks contributing to the finite baryon density .",
    "when the fermi energies of light quarks are higher than the bare mass of a @xmath3 pair , @xmath3 pair production is energetically more favorable than that of @xmath4 .",
    "hence , the production of nonstrange light antiquarks is suppressed , resulting in a high @xmath5 ratio in qgp .",
    "the definition of strangeness enhancement is broad . in this article , we use two types of definitions : ( 1 ) enhancement of strangeness production rate and antilambda to antiproton ( @xmath6 ) ratio in central heavy - ion collisions with respect to peripheral collisions , and/or to isospin weighted nn interactions at the same energy ; ( 2 ) enhancement in the ratio of strange antibaryons , @xmath7 ( high strangeness content ) with respect to @xmath8 ( low strangeness content ) .    the article is organized in the following way . in section  [ strangeness ] , we discuss strangeness enhancement at the ags and sps . in section  [ antibaryon ] , we discuss strange antibaryon enhancement .",
    "since strangeness and strange antibaryons are closely related , the discussions are necessarily coupled in these two sections . in section",
    "[ conclusion ] , we draw conclusions .",
    "at ags energy , the dominant carriers of strangeness produced in heavy - ion collisions are kaons ( charged and neutral ) and hyperons ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 s ) . charged and neutral kaon yields are approximately equal under charge ( isospin ) symmetry .",
    "hyperons are mostly produced through associate production with kaons .",
    "therefore , charged kaon yields give a fairly good overall scale of strangeness production at the ags .",
    "kaon yields are systematically measured by ags e802/859/866 .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] shows , in data points , kaon yields per participant as a function of the number of participants ( @xmath11 ) in si+a and au+au collisions.@xcite @xmath11 is a good indication of collision centrality under the participant - spectator picture of high energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the data show that kaon production rate steadily increases with collision centrality in si+al and au+au collisions . for comparison ,",
    "kaon yields per participant for isospin weighted nn interactions at the corresponding energies are shown in fig.[fig1 ] as the open circles and squares .",
    "the enhancement factor  the ratio of kaon yields per participant in heavy - ion collisions over the same energy nn interactions  is higher in au+au central collisions than si+a for both @xmath12 and @xmath13.@xcite    = 2.35 in = 2.35 in    the difference between si+a and au+au at the same number of participants ( say @xmath14 ) is qualitatively consistent with the different collision geometries under a binary collision model for kaon production , however , can not be quantitatively explained by glauber - type calculations of the average number of binary nn collisions.@xcite    from a classical glauber - type picture , in which each nucleon collides multiple times with others in a heavy - ion collision , with each collision having certain probability producing kaons , one would expect higher kaon production rate in heavy - ion collisions than nn . to check this expectation , fig.[fig1 ] shows , in the dashed curves , results of rqmd calculations for au+au collisions with meson - baryon and meson - meson interactions switched off .",
    "one observes slight increase in kaon production rate from peripheral to central collisions .",
    "however , in contrast to the expectation , the calculated kaon production rate in heavy - ion collisions is lower than the corresponding nn value .",
    "this is probably due to the net effect of the following : ( 1 ) not all the initial nucleons collide at least once at full energy ; ( 2 ) subsequent nn collisions have less than the full energy ; ( 3 ) ags energy is near kaon production threshold where kaon production rate changes rapidly with energy in elementary p+p interactions.@xcite    by including secondary meson - baryon and meson - meson interactions ( the default settings ) , rqmd is able to describe the qualitative features seen in the data .",
    "the results of the default calculations are shown in fig.[fig1 ] as solid curves .",
    "within the rqmd model , both baryon - baryon and meson - induced interactions increase kaon production rate .",
    "however , as seen from comparison between the dashed and solid curve ( for au+au ) in fig.[fig1 ] , the meson - induced interactions dominate for kaon production , especially in central collisions.@xcite since rqmd is a hadronic model , and it describes the general features of the data , it is fair to conclude that the observed kaon enhancement is consistent with hadronic physics . however , we note that subtle difference exists between the data and the default rqmd results .    as seen from fig.[fig1 ] , the centrality dependences of @xmath12 and @xmath13 yields are quite similar .",
    "the similarity is surprising because @xmath12 and @xmath13 are thought to be produced through different mechanisms : @xmath13 through pair production , and @xmath12 through both pair and associate production .",
    "kaon enhancement in heavy - ion collisions over nn is also observed at the sps.@xcite recent preliminary results from na49  @xcite show a similar centrality dependence of kaon yields as observed at the ags .",
    "data on production of the more exotic multistrange baryons and antibaryons are also available at the sps .",
    "wa97 results  @xcite show that the @xmath15 and @xmath16 midrapidity yields in the 30% most central pb+pb collisions are larger than those expected from p+pb by a wounded - nucleon scaling .",
    "the effect is the largest for @xmath16 , following the trend @xmath17 .",
    "more interestingly , the @xmath18 ratio is larger than @xmath19.@xcite na49 reported results on midrapidity @xmath20 production in the 5% most central pb+pb collisions,@xcite consistent with the wa97 results taken into account the different centralities .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows the @xmath19 and @xmath21 ratios from na49 ( 5% centrality )  @xcite , and the @xmath18 ratio from wa97 ( 30% centrality )  @xcite in pb+pb collisions . in the simple quark counting model , the particle ratios ( @xmath22 )",
    "present the ratio of @xmath23 , and the antiparticle ratios ( @xmath24 ) present the ratio of @xmath5 . in fig.[fig2 ] , one observes a hierarchy in the ratios : @xmath25 , and that the antiparticle ratios are systematically larger than the particle ratios , indicating non - vanishing baryon density at midrapidity in pb+pb collisions .",
    "= 2.8 in    rqmd predictions for central pb+pb collisions ( impact parameter @xmath26  fm ) are shown in fig.[fig2 ] as the small points connected by the lines .",
    "rqmd agrees with the @xmath19 data , but overpredicts @xmath21 by a factor of 1.52 , while underpredicts @xmath18 by a factor of 2 .",
    "the discrepency in @xmath18 between the data and rqmd may due to an underestimate of the string fragmentation probability into @xmath16 in @xmath27 , used in rqmd.@xcite an even larger discrepency is seen between data and urqmd model prediction.@xcite presumably , the better agreement between data and rqmd than urqmd is due to the novel `` rope '' mechanism,@xcite implemented in rqmd but not in urqmd",
    ". however , the `` rope '' mechanism is clearly beyond the scope of hadronic physics .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , enhancement in strange antibaryon production is a possible signature for qgp formation .",
    "preliminary results from ags e859 indicate a large @xmath6 ratio in si+au central collisions near midrapidity.@xcite direct measurement of @xmath28 production in au+au collisions at the ags was not available until recently.@xcite however , the @xmath6 ratio can be inferred from @xmath29 measurements in the midrapidity region by e864  @xcite and e878  @xcite at @xmath30 with different acceptances for @xmath29 from weak decays ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , provided that the experimental acceptances and systematics are well understood .",
    "the obtained @xmath33 ratio increases strongely with collision centrality , with a most probable value of 3.5 in the 10% most central collisions.@xcite    assuming @xmath34 yield of each sign is 1/3 of @xmath28 yield under isospin consideration , and @xmath34 , which may yield a deviation from 1/3 in a thermal model argument .",
    "however , the assumption of 1/3 is fairly consistent with and venus model calculations . ]",
    "the @xmath6 ratio can be deduced . further using the e866 measurements of @xmath29 s which include 60% weak decay @xmath29s,@xcite the yields of @xmath29 and @xmath28 can be obtained ,",
    "the results of which are shown in fig.[fig3 ] against collision centrality .",
    "the recent direct measurements of @xmath29 and @xmath28 yields by e917  @xcite are plotted as filled points .",
    "they agree with the obtained systematics , although suffering from large statistical errors .",
    "= 2.8 in    as seen from fig.[fig3 ] , @xmath29 yield increases from peripheral to medium central collisions , and saturates ( or even slightly decreases ) in central collisions .",
    "this is consistent with the picture that more @xmath29 s are absorbed in the nuclear medium in central collisions with higher baryon density and/or larger collision zone .",
    "however , the continuous increase of the @xmath28 yield is surprising . in the additive quark model ,",
    "@xmath35 annihilation cross section is 2/3 of @xmath36 s , therefore , a strong absorption of @xmath28 should also occur .",
    "because of the lack of @xmath35 annihilation cross - section data at the relavent low energy ( @xmath37  gev ) , hadronic models have to make assumptions for the cross - seciton to calculate @xmath6 .",
    "cascade calculations by wang _ et al._,@xcite using various parameterizations for the @xmath35 annihilation cross - section , fail to describe the observed @xmath6 in central collisions , while giving reasonable agreement to the peripheral collision data",
    ".    it would be interesting to compare the centrality dependences of @xmath28 and @xmath9 yields .",
    "since the @xmath9 yield centrality dependence at the ags is presently not available , we use the difference in @xmath12 and @xmath13 yields to reflect the @xmath9 yield , exploiting the constrain of overall strangeness neutrality , and further assuming @xmath38 and @xmath39 under isospin consideration .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig3 ] as the dashed curve .",
    "it is interesting to note that the centrality depedences of the @xmath9 and @xmath28 yields are very similiar , a feature also observed for @xmath12 and @xmath13 yields .",
    "= 2.6 in    from the centrality dependence of @xmath6 , it is hard to disentangle the two different effects , qgp formation and strong medium absorption , both giving an increasing @xmath6 with centrality .",
    "it is therefore attempting to examine the ratio as a function of collision energy , which is shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the two effects would give different dependences : at high energy , qgp formation would result in a high ratio , while strong absorption would result in a low ratio because the baryon density is lower at high energy.@xcite therefore , an increase of @xmath6 with collision energy would indicate qgp formation or other new physics . from the current data shown in fig.[fig4 ] , we can not draw conclusions .",
    "data at other energies are therefore highly desirable .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath8 ratios discussed in section  [ strangeness ] are significantly lower than @xmath6 shown in fig.[fig4 ] for pb+pb central collisions .",
    "this points to the speculation that medium absorption of strange antibaryons may be very different from that of antiprotons .",
    "again , measurements of low energy @xmath35 annihilation cross - sections are indispensable .",
    "we reviewed the ags and sps data on strangeness and antibaryon production .",
    "we draw the following conclusions :    * enhancement in charged kaon production is observed in central heavy - ion collisions at the ags with respect to peripheral collisions and isospin weighted nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the enhancement can be qualitatively explained by secondary particle scattering within the rqmd model .",
    "however , subtle difference exists between the data and rqmd . * a hierarchy of particle ratios , @xmath25 , is observed at midrapidity in pb+pb central collisions at the sps .",
    "the antiparticle ratios are systematically larger than the particle ratios . rqmd with string and rope formation and fragmentation , which is clearly beyond hadronic physics",
    ", may barely describe the data . *",
    "large @xmath6 ratios are observed in central heavy - ion collisions at the ags and sps .",
    "strong increase of the ratio from peripheral to central collisions is indirectly observed at the ags .",
    "hadronic cascade calculations , with certain assumptions for the @xmath35 annihilation cross - section , fail to describe the ratio in central collisions . * to fully understand the @xmath6 ratio in heavy - ion collisions , measurements of low energy @xmath35 annihilation cross - sections are needed . on the other hand , an excitation function measurement of @xmath6 may provide a new avenue in the search for qgp .",
