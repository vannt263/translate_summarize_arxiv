    "each continuum core was well fit by a single temperature blackbody ( bb ) , similar to equation  [ eq : plancktau ] . in order to obtain a good least - squares fit to each of these dust cores ( iras  27 ( 27 s1 ) , 27 s2 , and 27 s3 ) , source size ( @xmath44 ) , temperature ( t ) , and spectral index ( @xmath48 ) parameters",
    "were varied iteratively until a best fit solution was found .    fitting sed curves to iras  25 flux measurements proved more complex , and a two temperature component bb function was used . in order to obtain a good , physically plausible fit to these data ,",
    "both dust temperature components , t , and @xmath48 indices were selected and held constant while the source sizes , @xmath44 , were iteratively fit .",
    "the goodness of fit did not strongly depend upon the values of @xmath48 chosen for the two components and therefore the resulting fit does not reflect unique or precise values of spectral index . since spectral index is probably constant within the same molecular cloud complex , our choice of @xmath48 used to fit the iras  25 emission was guided by solutions from iterative fits of iras  27 ( 27 s1 ) , 27 s2 , and 27 s3 seds .",
    "the temperatures of the two components fit to iras  25 , 10k and 40k , were selected to be similar to the @xmath1730k obtained from using wien s displacement law to estimate the characteristic dust temperature for iras  25 .",

    "these values are consistent with those determined by hildebrand and are commonly used for molecular clouds in the galaxy .    at @xmath38 ,",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that the majority of the flux observed for iras  25 is due to the colder 10k bb component .",

    "this procedure is described in equation  [ eq : aweight ] , where @xmath116 is the area of the telescope beam at 345ghz , @xmath117 is the @xmath0co@xmath1 intensity at any map position , and @xmath118 is the @xmath0co@xmath1 intensity at iras  25 or 27 , depending on the map examined .",

    "the filling factor was calculated using @xmath106 , the integrated intensity and optical depth of the @xmath2co@xmath1 , and assuming lte conditions . filling factors obtained toward iras sources appear in table  [ tab : lteofprops ] . since @xmath2co@xmath1 measurements were made toward single positions , @xmath121 was assumed to be constant over the maps . in equation",

    "lte outflow energetics depend largely upon the choice of @xmath132 which is subject to uncertainty due to projection effects of the outflow with respect to the line of sight . determining a characteristic velocity representative of the bulk of the outflowing gas is therefore difficult . for this reason , lower and upper limits of the outflow energetics were determined using outer line wings of @xmath2co@xmath1 ( lv rw & lv bw ) and @xmath0co@xmath1 ( f  rw & f  bw ) for @xmath132 .",
    "the results of these calculations appear in table  [ tab : ofenergetics ] .",
    "these energetics results are largely consistent with those of @xcite .",

    ". there is no noticeable sign of rotation perpendicular to outflow axes to suggest the signature of an accretion disk .",
    "the centroid velocity gradients extend from the northeast corner of the plots to the southwest , roughly following the orientations of the outflow lobes .",
    "this suggests that ngc  2264  o & h outflows may dominate the energetics of their surroundings .    in order to illustrate this quantitatively ,",
    "the force of bulk motions of cloud material was calculated and compared with the force of the molecular outflow , @xmath82 . for this analysis ,",
    "the mass of the cloud was computed over the line core for each @xmath0co@xmath1 map , @xmath139 , using the emission weighted area approach described in section ( 3.2.3 ) .",

    "overall , the values of @xmath150 and @xmath82 are similar within factors of a few , indicating that the ngc  2264  o outflow has enough force to drive the bulk motions of the cloud material .    performing a similar analysis for ngc  2264  h results in @xmath151m@xmath146yr@xmath72 km s@xmath72 . compared with the force of the outflow , @xmath149m@xmath146yr@xmath72 km s@xmath72 ,",

    "values of @xmath150 and @xmath82 are within an order of magnitude , similar to ngc  2264  o. again it appears that the outflow force is capable of driving bulk motions in the cloud .",
    "the turbulent energy contributed to the cloud by the ngc  2264  o & h outflows , @xmath154 , was estimated using our @xmath0co@xmath1 data ( observations of an optically thin species , such as c@xmath155o , were not available ) .",
