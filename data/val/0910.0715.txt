    "the idea of inflation @xcite has become a standard paradigm since it was proposed in the early 1980 s .",
    "inflation is an accelerated expansion epoch in the very early universe , which solves the flatness , the horizon and also the monopole problems naturally .",
    "furthermore quantum fluctuation of the inflaton @xmath5 , which is a scalar field responsible for the accelerated expansion , can provide the seed of cosmic density / curvature fluctuations @xcite observed through the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy @xcite , galaxy clustering , etc .",
    "another prediction of inflation , which is in fact more generic , is the generation of the stochastic gravitational wave background or the tensor perturbation , whose spectrum is nearly scale - invariant @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the amplitude of the gravitational wave is simply proportional to the hubble parameter , @xmath6 , during inflation and many inflation models predict detectable amplitude of gravitational waves . in particular , future space - based gravitational wave detectors such as decigo @xcite and/or bbo have a chance to detect inflationary gravitational wave background .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that thermal history of the early universe is imprinted in the spectral shape of the gravitational wave background @xcite . in particular , the reheating temperature of the universe after inflation can be determined or constrained from future gravitational wave experiments @xcite .",
    "thus any detection of primordial gravitational wave background gives useful information on the early universe .",
    "traditionally , the spectrum of the comoving curvature perturbation is parametrized as @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the pivot scale which we take @xmath9  mpc@xmath10 and @xmath11 is the scalar spectral index .",
    "inflation predicts nearly scale - invariant spectrum with @xmath12 , with its precise value determined by the shape of the potential @xcite , and it agrees well with observations so far  @xcite . if @xmath5 has a single component with a canonical kinetic term , the resultant curvature fluctuation is gaussian distributed , which is again in agreement with the observation today @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of the density perturbation is not limited to the quantum fluctuation of the inflaton . another scalar field , called curvaton , may be responsible for the generation of the observed density perturbation @xcite .",
    "it is undoubtedly an important task to distinguish them in order to understand the physics of the early universe .",
    "one such signature may come from the non - gaussianity in the cmb anisotropy @xcite , since the curvaton scenario can produce large enough non - gaussian feature to be detected @xcite , while standard inflation models predict negligible non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "however , the situation where the curvaton generates large non - gaussianity is somewhat limited and it is possible that the curvaton accounts for the observed density perturbation without generating large non - gaussianity .    in this paper , we point out that the observation of stochastic gravitational wave background plays a very important role to probe the physics of the curvaton scenario . in the case",
    "that the curvaton generates negligible non - gaussianity , there must be an entropy production process by the curvaton decay itself , and such a non - standard thermal history is imprinted in the spectrum of the inflationary gravitational wave background .",
    "future space - based gravitational wave detectors , such as decigo and/or bbo may be able to do this job .",
    "this opens up a possibility to find an evidence of the curvaton scenario .",
    "thus measurement of the non - linearity parameter @xmath13 which is a simplified measure of non - gaussianity and that of tensor perturbations by decigo / bbo play complementary roles to each other .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : curvaton ] , the gravitational wave background spectrum and non - gaussianity in the curvaton scenario are summarized . in sec .",
    "[ sec : probe ] the detection possibility is discussed .",
    "[ sec : conc ] is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "in this section , we summarize the cosmological consequences of the curvaton scenario , namely , the spectra of gravitational wave background and the density / curvature perturbation , and non - gaussianity .",
    "all these ingredients are essential for probing the curvaton scenario and constraining the parameter space , as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : probe ] .      in the inflationary era",
    ", quantum fluctuations of the rms amplitude of @xmath14 are induced on all massless fields in each hubble time .",
    "here `` massless '' means that the mass is much smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "the tensor perturbation of the metric consists of two free massless scalar components , which can be quantized in de - sitter space - time .",
    "after a mode left the horizon during inflation , it actually becomes a classical fluctuation which can be viewed as a stochastic gravitational wave .",
    "thus inflation necessarily generates a gravitational wave background from a cosmological scale to a sub - kilometer scale the former is a target of detection by the b - mode polarization of cmb anisotropy and direct detection by space - based laser interferometer experiments .",
    "tensor perturbation of the metric is defined by the following line element , @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the scale factor and @xmath17 denotes the metric perturbation satisfying the transverse - traceless conditions @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "thus @xmath17 has two physical degrees of freedom , which are denoted as @xmath20 with @xmath21 . in the inflationary era",
    ", the tensor perturbation has a quantum fluctuation whose spectrum is given by @xmath22 where the tensor spectral index is given by @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is one of the slow - roll parameters during inflation defined by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the inflaton potential and the prime denotes derivative with respective to the inflaton field @xmath5 , and @xmath27 is the reduced planck scale .    after the production of the gravitational waves during inflation , the amplitude of each fourier mode remains constant when the corresponding mode lies outside the hubble radius .",
    "however , once it enters the horizon , its amplitude decreases as @xmath28 .",
    "thus the present energy density of the gravitational wave background per logarithmic frequency interval is written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the present scale factor , and @xmath31 denotes the scale factor at which the corresponding mode with wave number @xmath32 enters the horizon .",
    "it behaves as @xmath33 for the mode which enters the horizon at matter ( radiation ) dominated era",
    ". therefore thermal history of the universe is imprinted in the spectrum of the gravitational wave background , and this is the reason why the observations of the gravitational wave are expected to have great impacts on cosmology @xcite .    in terms of the density parameter , it can be rewritten as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the present hubble parameter , and @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the effective relativistic degrees of freedom at the temperature @xmath38 when @xmath32-mode enters the horizon , and @xmath39 is the spherical bessel function of the first rank with @xmath40 . )",

    "the transfer functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 are given by @xcite @xmath43^{-1}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the former connects the gravitational wave spectrum of the mode entering the horizon before ( @xmath44 ) and after ( @xmath45 ) the matter - radiation equality , where @xmath46 .",
    "hz @xcite .",
    "but our concern is around 1  hz , and hence we simply neglect this effect . ]",
    "the latter transfer function connects the mode entering the horizon before ( @xmath47 ) and after ( @xmath48 ) the reheating subsequent to inflation . here",
    "@xmath49 is the comoving wavenumber corresponding to the horizon scale at the reheating epoch when the universe became radiation dominant . without any significant entropy production after the reheating",
    ", it is given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 being the reheating temperature after inflation and the decay rate of the inflaton , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to the frequency @xmath530.026hz for @xmath54gev , which is close to the most sensitive frequency range of the planned future space - based laser interferometer experiments , decigo or bbo .",
    "thus by observing the spectral shape of the gravitational wave background , the reheating temperature of the universe can be determined or constrained .    as mentioned above , the above correspondence",
    "assumes the standard thermal history with no significant entropy production after reheating . in the curvaton scenario ,",
    "however , its coherent oscillation may once dominate the universe , which introduces an additional matter - dominated era , and then decays releasing huge amount of entropy . in this case",
    "the gravitational wave spectrum receives an additional suppression @xcite which can be quantified by the dilution factor , @xmath55 , defined by @xmath56 where @xmath52 is the decay rate of the inflaton , @xmath57 is the radiation temperature just after the curvaton decay , and @xmath58 is the temperature at which the curvaton begins to oscillate .",

    "note that we assume the curvaton behaves as free scalar field and hence @xmath75 can be regarded as a random gaussian variable .",

    "it is much smaller than curvaton s contribution ( [ normal ] ) by assumption .",

    "we investigate the possibility to detect either signature of the curvaton scenario and how they can fix properties of the curvaton .",
    "we have seen that a curvaton scenario may leave distinct signatures on either a shape of the gravitational wave background or primordial non - gaussianity . here",
    "we show parameter regions where a curvaton scenario has characteristic features on either of them .",
    "curvaton models are characterized by two parameters , the initial amplitude of the curvaton @xmath81 and its decay temperature @xmath57 .",
    "the relevant quantity is the abundance of the curvaton coherent oscillation at the time of its decay , which depends on these two parameters and the reheating temperature after inflation , @xmath51 , but does not depend on the curvaton mass . with @xmath58 , the temperature at which the curvaton begins to oscillate , as in eq .",

    "once these parameters are fixed , we can estimate the inflation scale @xmath6 in order to reproduce the observed magnitude of the density perturbation ( see eq .",

    "the spectral shape is determined by @xmath51 and the curvaton abundance at its decay .",
    "thus we can uniquely predict the gravitational wave signal at an arbitrary frequency for each parameter set ( @xmath108 ) .",
