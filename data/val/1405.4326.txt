    "in recent years the interest in transport through mesoscopic systems driven by time - dependent potentials has been increasing , in particular with the aim of obtaining enhanced control over the charge flow through the system . indeed",
    ", even the controlled emission of _ single electrons _ ( or a fixed integer number of electrons ) in a given time interval has been realized with periodically and nonlinearly driven mesoscopic capacitors  @xcite and electron pumps .",
    "@xcite these setups are usually based on the emission of particles from a confined region such as a quantum dot .",
    "they are useful for metrology , where a quantum standard for the current is sought for , or for the tuneable synchronization of particles for quantum optics with electrons .",
    "@xcite it is hence necessary to make these single - electron sources as precise as possible ,  @xcite decreasing their noise .",
    "furthermore , it is important to achieve a profound understanding of the properties of the source ,  @xcite for example by explicitly studying the waiting time distribution of emitted particles  @xcite and the energy spectrum of the signal .",
    "@xcite    a different way of creating a controlled and noiseless flow of single particles - without resorting to specific confined structures - is the application of lorentzian voltage pulses to a conductor .",
    "it has been demonstrated by levitov and coworkers  @xcite that a series of lorentzian - shaped pulses @xmath0 of quantised flux , @xmath1 , leads to the propagation of a noiseless train of independent _ single - particle _ excitations , which were therefore named _ levitons_.",
    "this means that , in striking contrast with the general situation where an oscillating voltage is applied , no electron - hole pairs induced by this particular time - dependent driving contribute to transport .",
    "recent experiments showed that by superposing several harmonic driving potentials a lorentzian pulse carrying an integer number of particles can be approximately achieved , leading to a reduction of the charge current noise reduction  @xcite and allowing for the study of controlled single - particle effects .",
    "@xcite    these recent efforts have boosted the general interest in the study of noise  @xcite as a powerful tool to characterize the response of a conductor to a generic time - dependent driving potential .",
    "@xcite in particular it has been shown that the noise carries information on the probability with which electron - hole pairs are created by the ac part of the driving  @xcite and it is sensitive to correlations between electrons and holes .",
    "@xcite electron - hole pairs do not carry charge and therefore their creation by the ac potential does not affect the average charge transport .",
    "however , these pairs carry a finite energy and they will thus strongly influence the properties of energy transport in ac - driven conductors .    here , we study a simple system consisting of a two - terminal conductor with a central scatterer . this system is subjected to an arbitrary , time - dependent bias .",
    "its study allows for general statements concerning the impact of electron and hole excitations on charge and energy transport and their fluctuations and it is at the same time appropriate to model the latest experiments on controlled charge transport .",
    "@xcite after revisiting the study of the charge current noise in ac - driven systems ,  @xcite we go beyond this study by considering in detail also the energy current and energy current fluctuations .    our analysis of the charge current noise considers in detail contributions due to _ correlations between electrons and holes _ created by the driving potential as well as the _ separate contributions _ of electron - like and hole - like excitations , and reconciles interpretations obtained from previous works  @xcite where the impact of electron - hole pairs and their correlations was debated .",
    "it turns out to be useful to separate the charge current noise into a _ transport _ part and an _ interference _ part .",
    "we then consider in the same terms the energy current and energy current fluctuations .",
    "motivated by the experimental progress in time - dependently driven electronic systems , there has indeed recently been growing interest in various aspects of their energy - transport properties .",
    "@xcite in this work , we show that while the energy flow can be interpreted as the time - average of the energy current due to a  frozen \" potential , energy fluctuations show specific features of the excitations created by the ac driving .",
    "in particular , we reveal features due to electron - hole correlations which are not visible in the charge noise and analyse their behavior for different types and superpositions of driving potentials , namely a harmonic or bi - harmonic driving as well as lorentzian pulses .",
    "specifically , for a system driven by lorentzian - shaped pulses , we show that the energy and its fluctuations are a tool to reveal that @xmath2 particles emitted by a sequence of @xmath2 lorentzians , each having a time integral equal to @xmath3 , are independent , while @xmath2 particles emitted at once by a lorentzian with a time integral equal to @xmath4 are not  @xcite - a characteristic which is not visible neither in the charge current nor in its noise .",
    "all the major features discussed in the energy noise can be shown to be present also in the power fluctuations .",
    "they are hence expected to be measurable in up - to - date experimental setups.@xcite    the manuscript is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce the floquet scattering matrix approach for time - dependent systems that we apply here ; more details are given in the appendix .",
    "the appearance of electron - like and hole - like excitations in charge and energy currents and their fluctuations are calculated in section  [ sec : ehpicture ] , followed by an interpretation of their contributions to the transport and interference parts of the noise , section  [ sec : driving ] .",
    "finally , we relate the energy noise to the heat noise and to measurable power fluctuations in section  [ sec : power ] .",
    "we consider a coherent mesoscopic conductor connected to metallic contacts ( also called reservoirs ) . the system is brought out of equilibrium by time - periodic voltages @xmath5 applied to these contacts .",
    "we describe charge and energy transport through the system within the scattering theory of photon - assisted tunneling developed by bttiker and coworkers,@xcite a brief summary of which is given in the appendix .",
    "as customary , we model the conductor in terms of a central scattering region connected to the external electronic reservoirs by ideal leads , i.e. pieces of ballistic conductors .",

    "similarly , assuming that energy is carried only by electrons , the energy flux in contact @xmath6 is given by the operator@xcite @xmath23    the physical observables that we are interested in are the dc - components of the average charge and energy currents @xmath24 as well as their zero - frequency auto- and cross - correlators    [ eq : noise - gen ] @xmath25    which in the following we will name in short the _ charge noise _ and the _ energy noise _",

    "since electrons obey fermionic statistics , charge transfer across the sample can only occur if the incoming state is filled and , at the same time , the outgoing state is empty .",
    "a dc voltage bias applied to the conductor opens an energy window ( typically named _ bias window _ ) where both conditions are fulfilled and transport is possible , fig .",

    "an ac potential applied on top of the dc bias perturbs the local equilibrium of the lead it is applied to , creating electron - hole pair excitations . whether both the electron and the hole of a pair contribute to charge and energy transport depends on their energy with respect to the bias window , as illustrated schematically in some examples in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch](b)-(c ) .",
    "while electron - hole pairs will not contribute to the average charge current , it however has an important impact on the charge noise , limiting e.g. the precision of single - particle emitters .",

    "one remarkable exception is the case where @xmath76 has the form of a series of lorentzian pulses of quantized area ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) : in this case only the e - like or the h - like part of the current is non zero , depending on the polarity of the pulses.@xcite the results and the discussion for the charge current are completely analogous , with the factor @xmath34 in the integrand of eq .",

    "this assumption is very well suited e.g. for the experiment on noise in an ac driven two - terminal conductor with a tunnel barrier treated in ref .  .",

    "moreover , increasing the dc component of the driving enlarges both the number of one type of excitations participating in transport ( e.g. @xmath167 for @xmath138 ) as well as the energy range that they span , while it suppresses the contribution of the other type of carriers .",
    "therefore a minimum of the transport part of the energy noise occurs when a trade - off between the amount of excited particles and their spread in energy is reached . in other words , in order to minimize the transport part of the energy noise , it can be favourable to even _ increase _ the amount of excited particles , if only the total energy spread is reduced at the same time .",
    "this is in contrast to the charge noise , where a minimum is reached when the _ number _ of excited particles is minimized .",
    "hence , when comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : str](a ) and ( b ) the minima of @xmath168 and @xmath169 are found for average bias voltages @xmath51 of opposite sign .",
    "for sufficiently large values of @xmath51 we can consider essentially only one type of excitation , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : str](b ) . then , @xmath170 at zero temperature takes the simple form @xmath171 which resembles closely the form of the energy noise in the case of a pure dc bias applied to the conductor @xmath172 in other words , for large dc bias , @xmath173 is equal to the time average of the energy noise that one would obtain in a series of `` frozen frames '' with a static bias potential , indicating that in this case the transport part of the energy noise can be interpreted as the contribution of particle excitations of only one kind that follow _ instantaneously _ the modulation of the driving potential @xmath76 .",
    "this simple picture breaks down as soon as @xmath51 is small enough so that @xmath174 changes sign during the driving period",
    ". then both @xmath175 and @xmath176 are non vanishing , and @xmath170 deviates from eq .  .",
    "this is different from what one observes for the energy current , @xmath177 , which can always be seen as the time - average of the energy current from a series of `` frozen frames '' with a static bias potential .",
    "the reason is that while the current is a single - time operator , the noise depends on the correlations between the current operator at two different times and , if the sign of @xmath76 changes over time , there is no simple mapping between the energy space , in which we define electron - like and hole - like excitations , and the time - space , in which one defines the `` frozen frames '' .    for small dc bias @xmath178 ,",
    "the energy noise of the electron- and the hole - like excitations depends strongly on the shape of @xmath179 .",
    "this can be seen for example in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_dep ] , where we plot @xmath180 and @xmath181 for the case of bi - harmonic driving @xmath182 as a function of the relative phase @xmath141 between the two harmonics .",
    "changing @xmath141 one obtains different waveforms for @xmath76 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_dep](a ) .",
    "we notice that while for the charge noise the transport contributions due to electron and hole excitations are equal for all @xmath141 , for the energy noise we have in general @xmath183 .",
    "this is because , while a pure ac voltage @xmath184 always creates the same number of electron and hole excitations , the energy distribution of the two types of excitations is equal only if @xmath76 is antisymmetric with respect to one of its nodes . for the kind of driving considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_dep ] , this occurs for @xmath185 , @xmath78 . for other values of @xmath141",

    "the energy noise @xmath187 is however independent of @xmath141 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_dep ] . at finite bias also",
    "the total transport part of the energy noise depends on @xmath141 .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the interference contribution to the energy noise , which is always independent of the phase dependence between the two superposed harmonics .",
    "based on the insights on the transport and interference parts of charge and energy noise , we finally address the case of a time - dependent driving with lorentzian shape , @xmath188 this rather general notation describes a series of @xmath189 lorentzian pulses emitted at fractions @xmath190 of the period , with a full width at half of the maximum value equal to @xmath191 .",
    "the single pulses have a quantized area if @xmath192 with @xmath193 . restricting ourselves to the case of zero temperature and assuming that the width of the pulses is much smaller than their distance , avoiding a possible overlap , it is known that a sequence of pulses with quantized area leads to the injection of an integer number of particles on the scatterer , without copropagating electron - hole pairs .",
    "@xcite this leads to a suppression of the charge noise , which is reduced to the level of a purely dc - biased conductor , @xmath194 .",
    "@xcite however , both the interference and the transport part of the energy noise have considerable contributions of comparable magnitude , related to the specific shape of the applied voltage pulse .    at zero temperature and for an integer number of particles injected on the scatterer by the driving potential given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lev ] ) , the transport and interference part of the energy noise allow for a rather intuitive interpretation .",
    "the absence of electron - hole pairs yields a transport part of the energy noise , @xmath195 , which indicates that the particles injected on the scatterer follow the potential modulation instantaneously , see the discussion of eq .. moreover , the interference part yields a contribution inversely proportional to the square of the width of the pulse , which is related to the intrinsic energy spread of the emitted particles . in particular we find @xmath196 , if one particle is injected per period .",
    "@xcite    importantly , it is known that @xmath2 single particles injected by separate pulses are truly independent of each other .",
    "@xcite such a situation is represented by the pulses given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lev ] ) for @xmath197 and arbitrary values of @xmath198 .",
    "this contrasts with the situation where several particles are injected by the same pulse , namely @xmath199 : while also in this case no electron - hole pairs contribute to transport , the emitted particles are however _ not _ independent of each other .",
    "@xcite this fact is not visible from the charge current and charge noise : in fact @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "this is different for the energy current and the total energy noise , where these two cases can indeed be distinguished . for a series of @xmath2 lorentzian pulses carrying each one single particle ( @xmath197 and @xmath198 ) ,",
    "the energy current and the total energy noise are given by the sum of the contributions of the single particles carried by separate pulses .",
    "we hence have @xmath202 as well as @xmath203 , indicating the independence of the injected particles , also called  levitons \" .",
    "@xcite however , when @xmath2 particles are emitted in the same pulse ( @xmath199 and @xmath204 ) the energy current  @xcite and energy noise of the particles do not simply add up any longer .",
    "this can be seen from @xmath205 for the energy current and from @xmath206 and @xmath207 for the two contributions to the energy noise .",
    "the total energy noise is hence not proportional to the energy noise of a single leviton any longer .",
    "for a realistic measurement , it is the _ heat _ current which is of relevance , rather than the _ energy _ current .",
    "the heat current operator @xmath208 accounts for the flow of energy in each reservoir that is in excess with respect to the local electrochemical potential and that must be dissipated in some nearby thermostat to keep the reservoirs in thermal equilibrium .",
    "since neither charge nor energy can be accumulated in the conductor , the sum of the heat currents flowing in all the contacts must be equal to the total power injected by the voltage source into the system . at the operator level , this means for a two - terminal conductor @xmath209 with @xmath210 the operator for the power provided by the time - dependent voltage source . from eq .",
    "it follows directly that @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is the _ heat noise _ and @xmath213 is the zero - frequency correlator of power fluctuations .",
    "the latter is an experimentally accessible quantity via measurements of the current correlator and the applied voltages .   the power fluctuations are directly related to the fluctuations in the work done by the time - dependent voltage applied across the sample during a long - time measurement . the features in the energy noise discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : driving ] can be detected in the fluctuations of the power delivered by the voltage source .",
    "explicitly , we find@xmath214 which at zero temperature reduces to@xmath215 containing the interference and transport part of the energy noise discussed in this paper .",
    "importantly , interference and transport part of the noise can be distinguished by their different dependence on the transmission of the barrier , which in systems containing quantum point contacts can be made tunable . for weakly transmitting barriers , the transport part is the main contribution , while for transparent barriers only the interference part matters .",
    "[ multiblock footnote omitted ]",
    "we discussed the charge and energy transport properties of a two - terminal conductor driven by an arbitrary time - periodic bias voltage , focusing in particular on the role of electron- and hole - excitations in the charge and energy noise .",
    "the noise exhibits two contributions of different character , namely transport contributions , containing correlations between particles in different leads , and interference contributions , due to correlations between particles in the same lead .",
    "we could show that only the latter contains signatures of the correlations between electrons and holes excited by the time - dependent driving . for the charge noise",
    "the interference part vanishes at zero temperature , allowing for an interpretation of the total charge noise in terms of binomial statistics of independent charge carriers , only .",
    "the total charge noise can hence be expressed in terms of the numbers of electron and hole excitations .",
    "the properties of the energy noise are more intricate , revealing quantum effects due to the superposition of different energy states in its interference part .",
    "the latter can be related to the variance of the energy distribution of the excitations due to different modes of the ac - part of the driving potential .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the charge noise , the transport part of the energy noise is sensitive to the _ spread in energy _ of the excited particles rather than to their _ number_. therefore , a minimum in the charge noise , occurring when the number of electron - hole pair excitations is suppressed , does not go along with a minimum in the energy noise .",
    "the minimum in the energy noise is due to a trade - off of the reduction of the number of excitations and their energy spread .",
    "for lorentzian pulses injecting an integer amount of particles on the scatterer , the dependence of the energy noise on the number of emitted particles is a measure of their dependent or independent emission .",
    "all discussed effects are expected to be observable via power fluctuations .",
    "we thank julien gabelli for insightful discussions .",
    "financial support from the ministry of innovation , nrw , from the excellence initiative of the german federal and state governments , as well as from the the swedish research council ( js ) , the alexander von humboldt foundation ( fh ) , and conicet , argentina ( fb ) are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "in this appendix , we briefly recall the main aspects of the scattering theory of photon - assisted transport developed by bttiker and coworkers , which underly the investigations performed in this paper.@xcite    we consider a multiterminal conductor with a periodic potential @xmath216 applied to each of its contacts @xmath6 .",
    "it turns out to be convenient to divide the conductor into different subsections , namely the reservoirs , the scatterer , and perfect ballistic leads connecting the scatterer to the reservoirs .",
    "the reservoirs are typically good metallic contacts with efficient screening properties .",
    "therefore , as long as the frequency of the driving is sufficiently slow , deep inside each reservoir @xmath6 , a change of the potential @xmath217 applied to that contact goes along with an equal shift of the band bottom , guaranteeing that local electrostatic equilibrium is maintained at every time @xmath218.@xcite as a consequence , the fermi level in the reservoirs , and therefore the occupation of each state with momentum @xmath46 , _ does not _ depend on the oscillating part of @xmath217 .",
    "in contrast , close to the scatterer and in the leads the effective potential  seen \" by the charge carriers",
    "has in general a non - trivial dependence on time due to the charge injected into the conductor and the one induced in the neighbouring gates in order to preserve charge neutrality of the whole device.@xcite this effective potential should in general be evaluated self - consistently .",
    "@xcite here , however , following also refs .  , we do not attempt a self - consistent treatment of the potential seen by the charge carriers and we simply assume that the time - dependent part of the driving voltages @xmath217 vanishes in the leads as we approach the scattering region . moreover , we assume @xmath217 to vary slowly with respect to the fermi wavelength , such as to not induce any additional scattering .",
    "although , this assumption on the spatial dependence of @xmath217 might seem rather artificial , it has turned out to be an appropriate model to describe various experiments on charge noise in ac driven coherent conductors.@xcite    since we assume the ac part of the driving to vanish close to the scatterer , the properties of the latter can be described by the time - independent ( elastic ) scattering matrix @xmath19 introduced in sec.[sec : model].@xcite as mentioned in that section , the crucial point in order to be able to evaluate observables such as the average current or the noise is to determine quantum statistical averages of the form @xmath219 or @xmath220 , where the operator @xmath37 annihilates an electron in channel @xmath17 in lead @xmath6 that impinges on the scatterer with energy @xmath34 .",
    "this requires relating the operators @xmath221 for electrons close to the scatterer to those , which we call @xmath222 , that correspond to the annihilation of electrons just injected by the reservoirs .",
    "since the latter remain in electrostatic equilibrium at every time @xmath218 , the statistical averages of the operators @xmath223 are simply equilibrium averages with respect to the local fermi level @xmath224 , i.e. @xmath225 .    to determine the relation between @xmath221 and @xmath222 we observe@xcite that close to the scatterer , where there is no oscillating potential , incoming particles in channel @xmath226 in lead @xmath6 are described by wave functions of the form @xmath227 , where @xmath228 is the coordinate along the direction of propagation , @xmath229 is the longitudinal momentum and @xmath230 is eigenfunction of the @xmath226th transverse eigenmode . in the portion of lead",
    "@xmath6 close to the reservoir , where the oscillating potential , @xmath5 , is finite , the wave - function is instead given by @xmath231 , where @xmath232,\\ ] ] is an additional time - dependent phase due to the oscillating part of the potential .",
    "matching the wave functions in the regions with and without modulation potential , and changing to a description in second quantization , one finds the required relation between operators @xmath221 and @xmath221 :  @xcite @xmath233 the coefficients @xmath43 are the fourier components of @xmath234 , as defined in eq .  .",
    "equation expresses the fact that the time - dependent part of the driving applied to a coherent conductor leads to a spread in energy of the wave - function , such that each state with energy @xmath34 impinging on the scattering region corresponds to a superposition of states with different energies in the reservoirs .",
    "the relationship between the operators @xmath12 and @xmath235 for outgoing and incoming particles in the reservoirs can be synthetically expressed in terms of a floquet scattering matrix @xmath236 , @xmath237 with @xmath238 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath239 represent the probability amplitude that an electron with energy @xmath240 incoming from reservoir @xmath241 in channel @xmath17 is ejected at energy @xmath34 and in channel @xmath226 in contact @xmath6 . note",
    "that since the driving is periodic , scattering can only occur between states that differ in energy by a multiple of the driving frequency .",
