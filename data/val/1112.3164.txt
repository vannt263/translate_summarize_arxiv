    "the retrieval of the state of a physical system is an important problem in classical as well as in quantum physics , and yet it is a subject which is seldom discussed in textbooks .",

    "@xcite , p. 136 ) .",
    "the probability for the new variable @xmath9 for all values of @xmath10 can then be used to reconstruct the phase - space density @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this procedure is similar to the familiar one employed in medical imaging for the reconstruction of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) configuration density @xmath11 , known as the computer aided tomography ( cat ) scan @xcite : one simply replaces the two - dimensional configuration - space variables @xmath12 of the cat method by the two - dimensional phase - space variables @xmath13 .    in _ quantum _ physics , a system may be prepared in a pure state described by a vector in hilbert space , or , more generally , in a mixed state described by a density operator @xmath14 ( ref .",

    "@xcite , p. 72 ) .",
    "the problem of state retrieval involves the inverse inquiry , i.e. , what are the measurable quantities whose values will suffice to determine the quantum state .",
    "historically , this question may be traced back to the pauli query @xcite whether one can reconstruct the wave function , amplitude and phase , for a one - particle system , from the probability of its position , i.e. , @xmath15 , and that for its momentum , @xmath16 ; here @xmath17 is the wave function in the momentum representation , the tilde indicating the fourier transform .",
    "we now know that , in general , this is not possible : we need more information than these two distributions .",
    "the literature on this subject , which is still of current interest , has grown enormously ever since .",
    "here we have made a selection out of these approaches , with the idea of providing a link with the classical reconstruction scheme .",
    "the classical approach based on @xmath3 , is , of course , untenable in quantum physics , where a fixed momentum precludes a well - defined position probability .",
    "a similar observation is applicable to the direct approach of measuring the joint probability of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , it is remarkable that the alternative method based on measuring @xmath9 defined in phase space can be taken over to _ quantum _ mechanics ( ref .",
    "@xcite , p. 143",
    "@xcite , p. 101 ) .",
    "but then the question arises : how can that be , if there is no such thing as a joint probability density @xmath0 in quantum mechanics ?",
    "it turns out that the answer one obtains by following this procedure is a function defined in phase space which , although is not a bona - fide probability density ( it is real , but not - necessarily non - negative , and has sometimes been named a  quasi - probability \" ) , contains all the information needed to compute any quantum mechanical expectation value we please , just as if we were given the complex wave function , or the density operator .",
    "this concept of quasi - probability was invented by wigner @xcite in the early days of quantum mechanics , with the purpose of finding the quantum - mechanical corrections to thermodynamic functions , and is known as the _ wigner function_. thus retrieving the wigner function using this tomographic method is a true quantum - state reconstruction , and to explain how this is achieved , and its relation with the classical tomographic approach , constitutes the main goal of the present paper .",

    "( [ inverse radon q , p qm ] ) for the quantum - mechanical one .",
    "there is another concept which has been very useful in the task of reconstructing a quantum state . to give a trivial example ,",
    "consider the eigenvectors of position and momentum : if the state vector of a system is an eigenstate of momentum , the system is _ equally likely _ to be found in any of the eigenstates of position .",
    "pairs of bases with a similar property have been extensively studied @xcite and are known as _ mutually unbiased bases _ ( mub ) .",
    "it turns out that mub constitute a powerful tool for state reconstruction , since it is possible to express the density operator that defines the state of the system in terms of a complete orthonormal set of operators @xcite .",
    "we will explain the mub approach to the problem of state reconstruction and show that the result [ see eq .",
    "( [ wfctn of rho(mub ) ] ) below ] is consistent with that found with the method explained above , based on tomography in phase space and the wigner function .",
    "even more important , we shall find that the two approaches correspond , essentially , to employing two ways of handling the same complete set of operators , thus providing a unified description of both methods .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we review the cat scan method , as employed for the reconstruction of a classical 2d density . in section [ classical reconstruction ]",
    "we present a scheme for classical state reconstruction in phase space similar to the cat method employed in configuration space . in section [ quantum reconstruction ]",

    "[ mub ] the alternative method for quantum state reconstruction based on the notion of mub .",
    "so far , the discussion has been restricted to quantum systems described in a continuous , infinite - dimensional hilbert space , because of our desire to make an analogy with classical physics .",
    "however , there have been many contributions to the problem of state reconstruction for quantum systems described in a finite - dimensional hilbert space employing the notion of mub .",
    "although these systems do not have a classical counterpart , still they allow us to draw an illuminating parallel with the various concepts that have been introduced for a continuous hilbert space .",

    "first we review briefly the method mentioned in the introduction , the cat scan , that is used for the reconstruction of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) configuration density @xmath11 .",
    "the mathematical procedure can be translated directly to retrieve a classical 2d phase - space density @xmath0 and , even more interesting for us , it can be taken over to quantum mechanics .    in a 2d cat - scan @xcite",
