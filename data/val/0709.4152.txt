    "the large amount of new cosmological data in the last decade has lead to what one may call the cosmological standard model . in this model",
    "the universe is close to flat , homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales , and today the energy density of the universe is dominated by dark energy ( @xmath5 ) , dark matter ( @xmath6 ) and baryonic matter ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this model is consistent with data ranging from the wmap measurements of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite to observations of supernovae of type 1a , galaxy distributions and several other observables ( with a few exceptions , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is often claimed that most of the data can be fitted with only six free parameters .",
    "this claim rests on the assumption of massless neutrinos , an assumption justified by the fact that adding the sum of the neutrino masses as a free parameter does not improve the fit substantially .",
    "however , from the observation of neutrino oscillations , there is a compelling body of evidence for non - zero neutrino masses ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "oscillation experiments do not give us any information on the absolute mass scale of neutrinos , only on the mass differences between the different mass eigenstates and mixing angles .",
    "the current best upper bounds on the neutrino mass from particle experiments come from the troitsk @xcite and mainz @xcite tritium beta decay experiments that found upper bounds on @xmath0 of @xmath8ev ( 95% c.l . ) .",
    "the katrin experiment @xcite that will start taking data in 2010 , is expected to lower this limit on @xmath0 by an order of magnitude to @xmath9ev ( in the case of no detection ) after three years of running .",
    "effects of neutrino masses can also be seen in cosmological observables , and the best upper limits on the absolute scale of the neutrino mass today come from cosmology .",
    "both cmb and the large scale structures ( lss ) of the galaxy distribution are probes that are sensitive to the neutrino mass , the observable quantity being the sum of the three neutrino mass eigenstates , @xmath10 .",
    "the upper bounds on @xmath11 from cosmology range from @xmath12ev @xcite to @xmath13ev @xcite ( 95% c.l . ) , depending on the data @xcite and cosmological model @xcite used .    on the experimental side",
    "there is a claim of detection of the absolute scale of the neutrino mass from the heidelberg - moscow neutrinoless double beta decay experiment , with an effective electron neutrino mass of @xmath14ev ( 99.73% c.l . )",
    "@xcite . however , these results are regarded somewhat controversial .",
    "the cosmological implications of this result are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we know that neutrinos are massive , and since we have no current priors on the neutrino mass in the allowed cosmological range , one should always marginalize over @xmath11 when constraining other cosmological parameters .",
    "@xmath11 turns out to be partially degenerate with several of the standard cosmological parameters , such that this marginalization over @xmath11 weakens the bounds on the other parameters in our model .",
    "thus , any prior knowledge of @xmath11 from non - cosmological experiments will serve to break degeneracies and improve the constraints on other cosmological parameters .",
    "the katrin experiment will provide us with such a prior on @xmath11 in a range that is relevant for cosmology . in this paper",
    "we investigate how the results from katrin will affect our estimates of other cosmological parameters .",
    "limits on the neutrino mass when combining results from katrin and wmap have been studied in a recent paper by that hst et al .",
    "our emphasis in this paper is on how other cosmological parameters are affected when the results from katrin are used as an external prior .",
    "section [ sec : cosmology ] contains a short review on the effect of massive neutrinos in cosmology . in section [ sec : data ] we will present the data and methods that we will use in our analysis , including the assumed priors from the katrin experiment . then we will present our results in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "a comparison of @xmath15 values found when introducing the katrin priors is presented in section [ sec : chisq ] .",
    "finally we summarize and conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "all our results are derived within the standard cosmological paradigm of a flat @xmath16cdm model , using the following free parameters : @xmath17 .",
    "here @xmath18 denotes the energy density of energy component @xmath19 ( m = matter , b = baryons , @xmath16=cosmological constant , cdm = cold dark matter ) relative to the total energy density of a spatially flat universe .",
    "the matter density , @xmath20 , is the sum of all non - relativistic components , such that @xmath21 .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is the dimensionless hubble parameter , defined by @xmath23 , @xmath24 denotes the amplitude of the primordial fluctuations , while @xmath25 gives the tilt of the primordial power spectrum . finally , @xmath26 is the optical depth at reionization . for more details on the parameter definitions ,",
    "see the description of the cosmomc code @xcite .",
    "the effect of massive neutrinos on cosmological observables is parameterized by @xmath27 , the sum of the neutrino masses , and is related to the neutrino energy density by the simple relation @xcite @xmath28 .",
    "we will also extend the parameter space by including @xmath29 , the equation of state parameter of dark energy , as a free parameter .",
    "we will assume @xmath29 to be constant .",
    "this parameter may be interesting to study , as it is fundamental in the understanding of the nature of dark energy , and since it is known to be slightly correlated with @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that this analysis rests on the assumption of a standard thermal background of 3 weakly interacting neutrino species .",
    "alternatives to this picture are studied in e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recent reviews of the role of massive neutrinos in cosmology can be found in @xcite . in this section",
    "we will only give a brief description of the most important effects of @xmath11 on relevant cosmological observables .",
    "we will throughout this work assume that the neutrino mass eigenstates are degenerate , such that @xmath30 .",
    "in the mass range that we will operating in , it has been shown that this is a valid simplification when it comes to cosmological observables @xcite .",
    "effects on the cmb from massive neutrinos manifest themselves mainly on the level of background evolution . in the neutrino mass",
    "ranges relevant to us , the neutrinos will still be relativistic at the time of matter - radiation equality , and must be regarded as a radiation component when it comes to the background evolution of the universe . increasing @xmath11 ( and thus also @xmath31 ) , keeping @xmath20 constant , will thus postpone the time of matter - radiation equality . this will enhance the acoustic peaks in the cmb power spectrum and give a small horizontal shift of the peaks to larger scales .",
    "this effect is shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : p ] . to compensate for this effect , one can increase @xmath20 and decrease @xmath32 .",
    "it is already obvious that @xmath11 will be correlated with both @xmath32 and @xmath20 ( and thus also @xmath4 when we stick to the assumption of spatial flatness ) .",
    "another effect comes from neutrino free - streaming , which will smoothen out gravitational wells on scales below an @xmath27- dependent neutrino free streaming scale @xcite . on scales smaller than this ,",
    "the acoustic oscillations will be enhanced , increasing the height of the peaks in the cmb power spectrum .",
    "neutrino masses affect the lss power spectrum in an even more distinct way . again",
    ", massive neutrinos will suppress structure growth on scales below a free streaming scale given by @xcite @xmath33 the smaller @xmath11 , the larger scales will be affected , and the larger @xmath11 , the more suppression of power on the scales affected .",
    "the effect of neutrino mass on the matter power spectrum can be seen in figure [ fig : p ] .",
    "again , @xmath20 is kept constant , and increasing @xmath11 has been compensated for by decreasing @xmath34 correspondingly .",
    "cmb ( left panel ) and lss ( right panel ) power spectra with different values of @xmath11 . here",

    "@xmath20 is held constant , and increasing @xmath11 has been compensated by decreasing @xmath34 correspondingly.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]",
    "our analysis include both observations of cmb , lss , sn1a , information about baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the matter power spectrum and constraints from the cluster mass function from weak gravitational lensing .",
    "we have also applied priors on @xmath32 and @xmath35 .",
    "the cmb data used in our analysis , comes from the temperature @xcite and polarization @xcite data from the 3-year data release from the wmap team .",
    "the wmap experiment is a satellite based full - sky survey of the cmb temperature anisotropies and polarization . in our analysis of the wmap data we have used the fortran 90 likelihood code provided with the data release .",
    "we have used lss data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample @xcite . as sn1a data we have used the sample from the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) @xcite .",
    "other probes of the matter distribution that we have applied come from the measurement of the baryonic acoustic peak ( bao ) in the matter power spectrum and the cluster mass function ( cmf ) from weak gravitational lensing .",
    "the bao constraint comes from the sdss - lrg sample @xcite , and we have adopted the fit function from @xcite , a _ = 0.469 ( ) ^-0.35 ( 1 + 0.94 f _ ) 0.017 , where a _",

    ".    handles on parameters governing the clustering of matter are also provided by the cluster mass function . the cluster mass function from weak gravitational lensing , as measured in @xcite , gives constraints on a combination of @xmath20 and @xmath38 ( the root - mean - square mass fluctuations in spheres of radius @xmath39mpc ) .",
    "we have adopted the fit - function for @xmath40 from @xcite , ^2_=10000u^4 + 6726u^3 + 1230u^2 - 4.09u+0.004 where @xmath41 .    a prior on the hubble parameter , @xmath42 @xcite comes from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project . from big bang nucleosyntesis ( bbn )",
    "we adopt a prior on the baryon density today , @xmath43 @xcite .    throughout the entire work",
    "we also apply a top - hat prior on the age @xmath44 of the universe : @xmath45 .      the katrin @xcite experiment measures the energy distribution of electrons from tritium beta decay .",
    "the exact shape of the end of this spectrum will depend on how much of the energy that is bound in the outgoing electron neutrinos , and thus also be a probe of the electron neutrino mass .",
    "if katrin does not detect @xmath0 , they are expected to place an upper limit on @xmath9ev ( 90% c.l . ) .",
    "they expect to reach an uncertainty of @xmath46 .    here",
    "we have adopted this uncertainty for two cases , one assuming @xmath1ev ( i.e. , no detection by katrin ) , and one assuming @xmath2ev ( giving @xmath47ev ) .",
    "further we have assumed the gaussian distribution of @xmath48 around these values @xcite , and used this as a prior in our cosmological parameter analysis .      employing the publicly available markov chain monte carlo code cosmomc@xcite",
    "we have studied our seven - parameter model for two combinations of datasets ; first using only wmap data , and then adding lss , sn1a data and priors from hst , bbn , bao and cmf . in both cases",
    "we have compared the results from using only cosmological data , and from adding priors from katrin in the case of @xmath1ev and @xmath2ev .",
    "first we will assume @xmath49 ( cosmological constant ) .",
    "yet more freedom in the cosmological model might be added by including @xmath29 as a free parameter , yielding a more general form of the dark energy component .",
    "we will also include @xmath29 in our analysis , assuming it to be constant .",
    "starting out , we considered the simplest case using only the standard 7 parameter universe model , as explained in section [ sec : cosmology ] , and wmap data only .",
    "then we added the assumed katrin priors for @xmath1ev and @xmath2ev as explained in section [ sec : katrin ] .",
    "the results are summarized in figure [ fig:1 ] and table [ tab:1 ] .",

    "in this paper we have investigated whether constraints on @xmath0 from the katrin experiment will affect our knowledge on cosmological parameters .",
    "this has been done for two scenarios , one where @xmath1ev , and one where @xmath2ev .",
    "we have carried out the analysis both with a simple 7-parameter model with a cosmological constant , and extending the parameter space to include the equation of state for dark energy , @xmath29 , as a free parameter .    when using wmap data only , we find that knowledge from the katrin experiment will contribute significantly to constrain a wide range of cosmological parameters , regardless of which of the @xmath0 scenarios we use .",
    "for instance will the significance of @xmath3 depend on what katrin tells us about @xmath0 .",
    "other parameters that are sensitive to the value of @xmath0 are @xmath20 , @xmath4 , @xmath38 and @xmath32 .    adding more cosmological data sets , both from sn1a , galaxy catalogues and other priors , the situation changes a bit . in this case",
    "@xmath11 is strongly constrained from above by cosmology alone , such that an additional katrin prior in the case of @xmath1ev has little effect on our cosmological parameter constraints . however ,",
    "if katrin measures a neutrino mass of @xmath2ev , there will be significant shifts in several of the parameter distributions .",
    "one should also note that several of the extra cosmological data sets added here may be affected by uncontrolled systematics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , having cosmological constraints from wmap+katrin without any additional cosmological data sets will be interesting regardless of the possibility to add other cosmological data sets to obtain similar results .    in the case of @xmath29",
    "the most interesting result occurs in the scenario of a katrin defection of @xmath2ev and using the full range of data sets . in this case",
    ", @xmath50 is favored at a @xmath51 level .",
    "it should also be mentioned that there are degeneracies between parameters from different cosmological inflation models and neutrino masses ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this means that a katrin prior on @xmath11 will be important also for constraining inflationary models .    to conclude , we find that the expected limits on @xmath0 from katrin , will be a useful input to constrain cosmological models , regardless of the value of @xmath0 .",
    "if katrin detects a non - zero value of @xmath0 , this would be especially interesting .",
