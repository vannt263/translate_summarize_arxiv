    "nonequilibrium pattern formation is widely observed in many physical , chemical and biological systems .",
    "significant progresses have been made in this field during the last few decades .",
    "for example , it has been found that nonequilibrium patterns can be grouped into a few universality classes @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "such a system is in constant interaction with its environment , and understanding the effect of extrinsic perturbation is of great theoretical and practical importance . in particular",
    ", it is interesting to study the deformation of an existing pattern or the formation of a new pattern under an external forcing .",
    "our understanding in such a direction is far from complete .",
    "petrov _ et al .",
    "_ , and later lin _ et al .",
    "_ , studied the light sensitive belousov - zhabotinsky ( bz ) reaction in an oscillatory regime in the presence of a periodic modulation of the intensity of illumination @xcite .",
    "they observed `` entrainment bands '' in which the system is frequency locked .",
    "different spatial patterns  stationary fronts , standing waves of labyrinth and more complex shapes  are observed within the bands . in a similar bz reaction setup ,",
    "vanag _ et al .",
    "_ studied spatial patterns and transitions among them in detail , and observed localized irregular / standing clusters as well as the above patterns @xcite .",
    "continuum models of forced pattern forming systems can be grouped into ones based on a kinetic model or on an amplitude equation . in the first group ,",
    "an unforced system is modeled by a coupled kinetic model , such as the brusselator , oregonator or fitzhugh - nagumo model , and parameters in the model are modulated to simulate the effect of external forcing ( e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand , near a bifurcation onset of a pattern , small differences among systems become irrelevant , and they are all described by one of a few universal equations .",
    "if the bifurcation is supercritical and oscillatory , and if the most unstable wave number is zero , the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) is the equation for the class of systems . in the presence of an external periodic modulation",
    ", it is shown that the cgle with an additional forcing term becomes the appropriate equation @xcite .",
    "there exist a few studies on forced cgle , and diverse behaviors are observed depending on several factors , such as the spatial dimension , the mode of the frequency locking , and the behavior of the corresponding unforced system @xcite .",
    "however , we do not even know what behaviors are possible , let alone understand them .",
    "even the simplest case of the 1:1 locking in one dimension displays a wide variety of behaviors . at large amplitude of the forcing ,",
    "a homogeneous state with no spatial structure is stable .",
    "et al . _ found that the homogeneous state becomes unstable to a periodic `` stripe '' or `` kink - breeding '' state as the forcing amplitude decreases , and a `` turbulent synchronized '' state  chaotic with its average phase is locked to that of the forcing  can appear , as the amplitude decreases further @xcite .    in this paper , we study in detail the homogeneous and stripe states of one dimensional forced cgle around the 1:1 locking .",
    "there are two borders regarding the homogeneous state ( 1 ) the stability border , below which the state loses its stability , and ( 2 ) the existence border , below which a homogeneous solution does not exist . in general",
    ", the existence and stability borders do not coincide .",
    "it is known that the stability border of the homogeneous state lacks a reflection symmetry around the @xmath0 line . here , @xmath1 is the difference between the natural and external frequencies , and @xmath2 is a nonlinear detuning parameter .",
    "we find the asymmetry can be explained by the linear stability of the state .",
    "also , the condition under which the existence and stability borders of the homogeneous state coincide is found .",
    "the stability border of the stripe state also lacks a reflection symmetry .",
    "an approximate phase equation is derived from the forced cgle , and it is found that its qualitative behavior is identical to that of the original equation , at least in the region of present interest .",
    "an analytic expression of the stripe state for the phase equation is obtained , which is used to explain the asymmetry of the border of the stripe state .",
    "near the stability border of a homogeneous state of an extended pattern forming system , the time evolution in a large spatial and temporal scale is given by one of a few universal equations @xcite .",
    "if the instability is oscillatory and supercritical , and the wave number of the most unstable mode is zero , the cgle , @xmath3 is the governing equation . here , @xmath4 is complex amplitude , and @xmath5 are real constants .",
    "the behavior of the cgle is relatively well understood , especially in one and two dimensions @xcite .",
    "it has plane wave solutions , which are stable only if @xmath6 .",
    "otherwise , the benjamin - feir instability sets in , making the solutions unstable . near the unstable side of the stability border ( @xmath7 line ) , `` phase turbulence '' is observed , which is characterized by disordered cellular structure and the absence of a defect ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "`` defect turbulence '' is observed further in the unstable region , where constant creation and annihilation of defects is observed @xcite . in this paper , the value of @xmath9 is mainly used , which is in the phase turbulence region .",
    "consider the case wherein a sinusoidal forcing is applied to the system of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cgle ] ) .",
    "it was shown that an additional forcing term should be included , and its form can be determined from the conditions of the spatial and temporal translation invariance @xcite . for a harmonic forcing ( near the 1:1 tongue ) , the resulting equation is @xmath10 where @xmath1 is the difference between the natural and forcing frequencies , and @xmath11 is related to the amplitude of the forcing .",
    "we first seek for the homogeneous solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fcgle ] ) . in polar coordinates [ @xmath12 , the equation becomes @xmath13 for a sufficiently large @xmath11 , the system is expected to lock to the forcing .",
    "its homogeneous solution is @xmath14 which can have one or three roots depending on the parameters .",
    "for the three root case , only the one corresponding to the largest @xmath15 is stable .",
    "the region of the parameter space in which a locked homogeneous solution exists is shown in fig .  [",

    "we apply the linear stability analysis to the homogeneous solution @xcite , where the behavior of a small deviation from the solution @xmath16 and @xmath17 is studied .",

    "a distinct feature of the stability border is that it is not symmetric to the @xmath0 line . as shown in the figure ,",
    "the difference between the existence and the stability border is smaller at the @xmath25 side .",
    "moreover , the difference vanishes for @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "this feature can be understood from the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath28 , which is given by eq .",

    "as will be discussed later , an approximate phase equation is derived from eq .",

    "the origin of the instability of the homogeneous state of the phase equation can be traced to a laplacian term , whose coefficient is a decreasing function of @xmath1 , and becomes negative at @xmath33 .",
    "thus the homogeneous state is stable for @xmath34 , and it becomes more unstable as @xmath1 increases .      the behavior below the stability border is investigated numerically .",
    "the forced cgle in one dimension is integrated using a pseudospectral method for various @xmath1 and @xmath11 @xcite . the spatial resolution",
    "@xmath35 and time step @xmath36 used are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",

    "is chosen to be @xmath39 , and the time interval of @xmath40 is used .",
    "larger systems for longer intervals are also studied , and no change in the behavior is observed .",
    "the numerical integrations confirm the prediction that the homogeneous state is stable above the stability border .",
    "it is found that the state undergoes a supercritical bifurcation to a spatially periodic static `` stripe '' state as @xmath11 decreases below the border , and the modulation amplitude of the state , defined as @xmath41 , behaves as @xmath42 close to the border [ fig .",
    "[ fig : stripe](a ) ] .",
    "the wave number of the stripe state is found to agree very well with @xmath28 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kmax ] ) , especially near the border .",
    "in order to check how the nature of the transition depends on the unforced dynamics , the transition from a homogeneous state is examined for four different values of @xmath43 : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "it is found that a supercritical transition to the stripe state is observed for the first two cases belonging to the benjamin - feir ( bf ) unstable region , while a transition to a disordered structure is observed for the other two cases belonging to the bf stable region .",
    "as @xmath11 decreases further , the stripe state becomes unstable to a fluctuating stripe or `` kink - breeding '' state , depending on @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the stability border of the stripe state is determined , and is plotted in fig .",

    "the region of the stripe state is much broader on the @xmath48 side .",
    "moreover , it extends to the region where a locked homogeneous state does not exist .",
    "the origin of the asymmetry will be discussed using a phase equation , and is found to be very different from the case of the homogeneous state .",
    "an approximate phase equation can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fcgle ] ) as follows .",
    "define small variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and assume that the time scale for @xmath51 is much larger than that for @xmath52 .",

    "since @xmath32 is @xmath57 at @xmath0 , and is a slowly varying function of @xmath1 , it is expected that setting @xmath58 does not change the qualitative behavior of the equation . on the other hand ,",

    "[ fig : phase - d](b ) for @xmath72 .",
    "note that the shapes of the borders are qualitatively the same as those of the forced cgle : the stability border is asymmetric to the @xmath0 line , and the two borders meet for @xmath73 .",
    "since the wave number of the most unstable mode should be zero at @xmath74 , one arrives at @xmath75 for the above values of @xmath2 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 , which is comparable to the value of @xmath31 for the forced cgle .",
    "the simple structure of the phase equation makes its interpretation simple .",
    "the reason for the instability is that @xmath78 can be negative , while the @xmath61 term always tries to suppress such an instability .",
    "the value of @xmath78 remains positive for @xmath79 , and the homogeneous state is stable .",
    "as @xmath1 increases further , @xmath78 becomes negative . since @xmath78 is a decreasing function of @xmath1 , the instability becomes stronger with increasing @xmath1 , which explains the fact that the difference between the existence and stability border increases with @xmath1 .",
    "the behavior of the phase equation below the stability border is studied numerically .",
    "as one crosses the border , the homogeneous state goes through a supercritical bifurcation to a stripe state , and the modulation amplitude @xmath80 behaves as @xmath81 close to the border . a typical dependence of @xmath82 on @xmath11 is shown in fig .",
