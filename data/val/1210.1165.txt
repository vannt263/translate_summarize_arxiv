    "fullerenes and fullerene - related molecules have attracted much attention since their discovery in the laboratory ( kroto et al .",
    "1985 ) due to their potential applications in superconducting materials , optical devices , and medicine . in the astrophysical context",
    ", these complex molecules have been proposed as explanations for unidentified astronomical features such as the intense uv absorption band at 217 nm ( e.g. , cataldo & iglesias - groth 2009 ) and the enigmatic diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) ( herbig 1995 , 2000 ; iglesias - groth 2007 ) .",
    "the remarkable stability of fullerenes against intense radiation ( e.g. , cataldo , strazzulla & iglesias - groth 2009 ) has encouraged the idea that fullerenes should be present in the interstellar medium . indeed , the 9577 and 9632   dibs observed in a few reddened stars lie near two electronic transitions of the c@xmath0 cation observed in rare gas matrices ( foing & ehrenfreund 1994 ) but the presence of fullerenes in astrophysical environments has been uncertain until recently , when the mid - ir spectral signatures of the c@xmath0 and c@xmath3 fullerenes were detected in several planetary nebulae ( cami et al .",
    "2010 ; garca - hernndez et al .",
    "2010 , 2011c ) .",
    "interestingly , garca - hernndez et al .",
    "( 2010 ) showed that contrary to theoretical and experimental expectation , fullerenes are efficiently formed in normal h - rich circumstellar environments .",
    "the prevailing laboratory view was that the synthesis of fullerenes is much more efficient under hydrogen - poor conditions ( kroto et al .",
    "1985 ; de vries et al . 1993 ) .",
    "thus , circumstellar envelopes around r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars ( see e.g. , lambert & rao 1994 for a review ) have been considered as promising environments for the formation of fullerene molecules ( goeres & sedlmayr 1992 ) .",
    "this is because the rcbs hydrogen deficiency together with the he- and c - rich character of the gas resembles the laboratory conditions where fullerenes are produced .",
    "however , this suggestion is not supported by our recent _ spitzer _",
    "observations of a large sample of rcb stars , which show that fullerene formation is inefficient in the highly h - deficient environments characteristic of most rcbs ( garca - hernndez et al .",
    "2011a , b ) .",
    "surprisingly , the only exception among rcbs is the least h - deficient rcb star dy cen ( possibly also the second least h - deficient rcb star v854 cen ) that shows mid - ir emission features at @xmath17.0 , 8.5 , 17.4 , and 18.8 @xmath2 m coincident with the ir transitions of c@xmath0 .",
    "contrary to fullerene - containing pne , the latter c@xmath0 mid - ir features in dy cen are seen in conjunction with very strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features .",
    "this striking difference between the ir spectra of fullerene - containing pne and dy cen is explained by duley & hu ( 2012 ) who attribute the @xmath17.0 , 8.5 , 17.4 , and 18.8 @xmath2 m features in dy cen to proto - fullerenes ( or fullerene precursors ) rather than to the c@xmath0 molecule .",
    "based on their laboratory spectroscopy of hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ) nanoparticles , duley & hu ( 2012 ) suggest that these four ir features may be due to proto - fullerenes in sources such as reflection nebulae , rcb stars , and proto - pne , which also show the unidentified 16.4 @xmath2 m feature and other very strong pah - like features . in light of the",
    "now suspect infrared identification of neutral c@xmath0 , we sought to detect the molecule s electronic transitions in absorption from dy cen s optical spectrum , as an additional check to the presence of c@xmath0 and see whether duley & hu ( 2012 ) s  proto - fullerenes \" suggestion could be substantiated .",
    "high - resolution ( r@xmath130,000 ) and high - quality ( signal - to - noise ratio s / n@xmath4200 ) optical ( @xmath13300 - 9450  ) spectroscopic observations of dy cen ( v=12.7 , e(b - v)=0.50 , see table 1 ) were obtained in the period february - march 2010 at the european southern observatory ( eso ) .",
    "the uves spectrograph at the eso vlt ( paranal , chile ) was used with the 1.2 \" slit and the standard setting dic2 ( 390 + 760 ) .",
    "we obtained 11 individual exposures of 1800 s each , giving a total exposure time of 5.5 hours .",
    "the s / n in the continuum in the summed dy cen s spectrum is @xmath1200 at 4000   and higher than 250 at wavelengths longer than 6000  . the observed spectra - processed by the uves data reduction pipeline ( ballester et al .",
    "2000 ) - were corrected for heliocentric motion and the stellar continuum was fitted by using standard astronomical tasks in iraf .    as a comparison star for dy cen in our search for c@xmath0 and dibs , we selected the very nearby b0.5 ia bright supergiant hd 115842 , which only differs in galactic longitude and latitude by 0@xmath5.88 and 1@xmath5.46 , respectively .",
    "this is because hd 115842 has the same reddening ( e(b - v)=0.5 ) as dy cen and it may be located at a comparable distance , sampling similar ism conditions .",
    "a comparison between hd 115842 and dy cen will probably enlighten the environmental changes associated with dy cen .",
    "thus , hd 115842 was also observed on the same dates as dy cen with the same vlt / uves set - up .",
    "table 1 compares dy cen with the comparison star hd 115842 in terms of galactic coordinates , spectral type , magnitude , and reddening .",
    "finally , a spectrum of bd @xmath69@xmath7 4395 , an extreme helium ( ehe ) star that shows a photospheric spectrum similar to that of dy cen , was obtained by us with the 2.7 m harlan smith telescope and the tull coud spectrograph ( tull et al . 1995 ) at a spectral resolving power of 60,000 .",
    "we have inspected the optical spectrum of dy cen in order to search for the presence of optical absorptions of neutral c@xmath0 .",
    "the allowed transitions at wavelengths below 4100   are much more intense than those of the herzberg - teller induced forbidden transitions at longer wavelengths ( leach 1992 ) .",
    "the strongest allowed electronic transitions of neutral gas phase c@xmath0 molecules , as predicted from laboratory experiments , are located at @xmath8 , 3980@xmath9 , and 4024.0@xmath9   with widths of 8 , 6 , and 4  , respectively ( sassara et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the oscillator strength ( f ) of the @xmath14024 c@xmath0 band is similar to that at 3980   ( leach 1992 ) , while the 3760   band has a five times higher oscillator strength ( braga et al . 1991 ) .",
    "dy cen s optical spectrum is dominated by strong he i , c ii , ne i , o ii , and n ii absorption and variable emission lines together with nebular forbidden emission lines from [ o ii ] , [ n ii ] , [ s ii ] , etc . the presence of these absorption and emission lines ( fwhm@xmath11  ) complicates the detection of broad and weak absorption features",
    ".    we can find no evidence for the presence of c@xmath0 in absorption ( or emission ) at the wavelengths of the expected electronic transitions : + * the 3760@xmath10   band : * this , the strongest of the three in our bandpass , falls amongst a series of o ii lines .",
    "these lines give consistent o abundances suggesting that none is does blended with a c@xmath0 feature ( figure 1 , left panel ) , even though its central wavelength is uncertain by @xmath11 (sassara et al .",
    "note that the apparent additional absorption at 3756   in dy cen is a stellar blend ( figure 1 , left panel ) .    * the 3980@xmath12   band : * this coincides with a stellar c ii line from a multiplet represented by other lines . a secondary contributor may be the al iii 5d @xmath13d - 8f @xmath13f@xmath7 multiplet ( figure 1 , right panel ) .",
    "the c ii lines are present also in bd @xmath14 .",
    "this coincidence and the line s ` stellar ' width show that c@xmath0 is not a significant contributor .",
    "an interesting feature of the right panel of figure 1 is the appearance of an unidentified broad feature in dy cen at 4000   ( fwhm @xmath1 2  ; equivalent width of 91 m ) .",
    "it is to be noted here that the 4000   feature is real .",
    "first , a strong argument in favour of the 4000   feature being real is that it doest not appear in the spectra of the comparison star taken with the same set - up and at the same time .",
    "second , the 4000   band is clearly seen when reducing the corresponding _ echelle _ order alone .",
    "this is not a known dib ; it s not present in hd 115842 where all dibs have a similar strength to those in dy cen ( see below ) and neither is it listed by hobbs et al .",
    "identification as c@xmath0 would demand a wavelength error of either 20   for the 3980   transition or 24   for the 4024   transition but sassara et al .",
    "give the wavelength uncertainty as just @xmath9   for both transitions .",
    "* the c@xmath0 band at 4024.0@xmath12 : * this is irretrievably blended with the he i 4026   line and adjacent lines .",
    "we estimate that the one - sigma detection limits on the column density from the 3760 and 3980   c@xmath0 bands in our dy cen spectra ( s / n@xmath1200 ) are 4.6 @xmath15 10@xmath16 and 1.5 @xmath15 10@xmath17 @xmath18 , respectively",
    "1.064 x fwhm / ( s / n ) ( see e.g. , hobbs et al . 2008 ) . ] .",
    "it is of interest to compare this column density limit of about 10@xmath17 @xmath18 with the number of c@xmath0 molecules calculated from the infrared emission features attributed to these molecules .",
    "this exercise is attempted next .",
    "the ir features measure the number of molecules in excited vibrational states but the electronic transitions sought here depend on the molecules in their ground vibrational state .",
    "analysis of the strengths of the ir features with the estimated a - values ( cami et al .",
    "2010 ; garca - hernndez 2011a ) shows that the excitation temperature is about 600 k. with this temperature , we estimate the number of molecules in the ground state : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , the distance to dy cen , is given in kpc .",
    "the column density pertinent to our non - detection of c@xmath0 depends on how the line of sight to the star intersects the c@xmath0-containing part of the circumstellar shell .",
    "assume a spherical shell centered on the star with inner and outer radii of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , with the line of sight running directly from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "assume a uniform density of c@xmath0 molecules throughout the shell , then the density of molecules is @xmath23(c@xmath0 ) where    @xmath24    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are given in au .",
    "shell radii are estimated from the run of dust temperature with distance from the star .",
    "the equilibrium temperature of a gray dust grain @xmath25 in an optically thin circumstellar environment is given by    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the stellar radius , r is the radial distance from the stellar center , and @xmath28 is the stellar blackbody temperature ( kwok 2007 , p. 314",
    ", equation ( 10.32 ) ) . if stellar radii and temperature are estimated from the stellar luminosity @xmath29 , the distance @xmath30 is provided by    @xmath31    for @xmath30 in au .",
    "adopting @xmath32 , we find @xmath33 = 600 k at @xmath30= 21 au and @xmath33 = 270 k at 104 au where the former temperature is the excitation temperature of the c@xmath0 molecules and the latter temperature is the blackbody temperature of the dust .",
    "if we adopt r@xmath34 @xmath35 au and @xmath36 au , we obtain @xmath23(c@xmath0 ) = 0.7d@xmath37 @xmath38 or @xmath23(c@xmath0 ) = 34 @xmath38 for @xmath39 kpc and 17 @xmath38 for @xmath40 kpc .",
    "then , the estimates for the c@xmath0 column density along the path ( @xmath41 ) are @xmath42 @xmath18 for 7 kpc and @xmath43 @xmath18 for 5 kpc .",
    "such estimates are uncomfortably greater than the observed upper limit of around @xmath44 @xmath18 .",
    "one possible explanation of this 1000-fold discrepancy is that the line of sight to dy cen does not intersect the c@xmath0-containing regions of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "an alternative view raises doubts about the ir detection of the c@xmath0 molecule in dy cen ( possibly also in v854 cen ; garca - hernndez et al .",
    "2011a ) , supporting the recent claim that the @xmath17.0 , 8.5 , 17.4 , and 18.8 @xmath2 m features seen in astronomical sources with pah - like dominated ir spectra should be attributed to proto - fullerenes or fullerene precursors rather than to c@xmath0 ( duley & hu 2012 ) .",
    "the latter seems to be consistent with the characteristics of the dibs towards dy cen , which are studied below .",
    "as we have mentioned above , we detect in dy cen a broad unidentified feature centered at @xmath14000  , which is seen in dy cen only ( fig .",
    "1 ) . note that no diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) are known at this wavelength ( see e.g. , hobbs et al .",
    "2008 ) . to our knowledge",
    ", no molecule is known to exhibit a strong electronic transition at @xmath14000   and this is corroborated by inspecting the nist chemistry webbook database .",
    "we speculate that this 4000   band may be related to the proto - fullerenes or fullerene precursors seen in the ir and that could be very abundant in the circumstellar envelope of dy cen .",
    "thus , the 4000   feature may represent a new and very unusual diffuse band ( dib ) .",
    "we used the exhaustive list of dibs provided by hobbs et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in hd 204827 to search for them in the spectrum of dy cen .",
    "dibs detected in dy cen ( and the comparison star hd 115842 ) are given in table 2 , where we give the central wavelength ( after applying the heliocentric correction ) , full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) in  , equivalent width ( eqw ) in m , central depth ( a@xmath45 ) , and the s / n ratio in the neighbouring continuum .",
    "figure 2 compares a selection of dibs in dy cen with those in hd 115842 .",
    "table 2 ( also figure 2 ) shows that the dibs towards dy cen have about the same or slightly less ( up to 30 per cent ) strength , the same fwhm , and a similar radial velocity as those towards hd 115842 .",
    "since both stars have roughly the same interstellar reddening e(b - v ) , the similar profiles and strengths for their dibs is not surprising . in addition , for the well studied dibs at 5780 , 5797 , 5850 , 6196 , 6379 , and 6614  , the normalised equivalent widths eqw / e(b - v ) in dy cen agree very well with those measured in field stars by luna et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and in the prototype star hd 183143 ( herbig 1995 ) .",
    "the exceptions to the above trends are the dibs at 6284   and at 7223  .",
    "the 7223  dib is stronger in dy cen than in hd 115824 as seen from the divided spectrum , but we could not estimate its total absorption because of the interference from the superposed telluric lines .",
    "figure 3 ( left panel ) shows the region of 6284   for both stars .",
    "the spectra have been cleaned of telluric lines .",
    "it is clear that this dib towards dy cen is stronger than towards hd 115842 , suggesting that the carrier of the 6284  dib ( along with 7223  ) is different from the rest of the classical dibs .",
    "indeed , the strength of this dib seems to be poorly correlated with the interstellar reddening .",
    "for example , luna et al . ( 2008 ) and herbig ( 1995 ) obtained eqw / e(b - v ) of 0.90 and 1.50 for field reddened stars and hd 183143 , respectively , while we measure a value of 1.10 towards dy cen ; hobbs et al . (",
    "2008 ) give a value of 0.41 in hd 204827 .",
    "curiously , the post - agb star iras 06530@xmath60213 , which shows the strongest unidentified 21 @xmath2 m feature ( zhang , kwok & hrivnak 2010 ) , also shows an unusually strong 6284  dib ( see luna et al .",
    "the 21 @xmath2 m feature may be attributed to hacs or their decomposition products such as fullerene precursors or intermediate products ( see e.g. , garca - hernndez 2012 ) .",
    "it is to be noted here that examination of atomic and molecular lines towards the sight lines of dy cen and hd 115842 show that ionized lines are enhanced in strength in the sight line towards dy cen relative to that of hd 115824 , which might suggest that the carrier(s ) of the 6284  and 7223  dibs could even have some contribution from ionized species .",
    "finally , we would like to remark that the very broad 4430   dib in dy cen is almost identical to that in the comparison star hd 115842 .",
    "this is shown in the righthand panel of figure 3 where we compare the 4400@xmath64450   spectral region for both stars .",
    "the 4430   dib has been linked to fullerenes bigger than c@xmath0 ( e.g. , c@xmath46 , c@xmath47 , c@xmath48 , and c@xmath49 ) and/or buckyonions such as c@xmath0@c@xmath47 and c@xmath0@c@xmath47@c@xmath49 ( iglesias - groth 2007 ) .",
    "our finding also would be consistent with fullerenes and fullerenes - containing molecules not being especially overabundant towards dy cen .",
    "duley & hu ( 2012 ) show that the infrared features at @xmath17.0 , 8.5 , 17.4 , and 18.8 @xmath2 m detected in astronomical sources with pah - like dominated ir spectra - such as those of the rcb stars dy cen and v854 cen ( garca - hernndez et al .",
    "2011a ) , the reflection nebulae ngc 7023 and ngc 2023 ( sellgren et al .",
    "2010 ) or the proto - pn iras 01005@xmath507910 ( zhang & kwok 2011 ) should be attributed to fullerene precursors ( or proto - fullerenes ) rather than to c@xmath0 .",
    "our non detection of neutral c@xmath0 in dy cen may support this claim .",
    "thus , the carrier of the new 4000   absorption band detected in dy cen may be intimately related with the fullerene precursors seen at infrared wavelengths .",
    "duley & hu ( 2012 ) suggest that fullerene precursors contain pentagonal carbon rings ; the infrared emission features at @xmath17.0 and 16.4 @xmath2 m usually detected in objects with pah - like dominated ir spectra are characteristics of pentagonal rings ( moutou et al . 2000 ) .",
    "pentagonal carbon rings are present in carbon nanoparticles ( e.g. , hacs ; duley & hu 2012 ) and nanotubes although these have less perfect structures than c@xmath0 and other fullerenes .",
    "in summary , the non detection of neutral c@xmath0 in the high - quality vlt / uves dy cen s spectrum may support recent experimental work , showing that the @xmath17.0 , 8.5 , 17.4 , and 18.8 @xmath2 m ir features seen in sources with pah - like dominated spectra have to attributed to proto - fullerenes rather than to neutral c@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the new 4000   dib reported here ( possibly also the carriers of the classical 6284  and 7223  dibs ) may be related to fullerene precursors ; an organic compound containing pentagonal rings .",
    "these pentagonal carbon rings are usually present in hac nanoparticles and nanotubes , suggesting that they may be intimately related with the formation process of fullerenes .",
    "this work is based on observations obtained with the eso very large telescope at paranal under the director s discretionary time ( ddt ) programme 284.d- 5048(a ) ( pi : d. a. garca - hernndez ) .",

    "<S> absence of c@xmath0 absorption bands may support recent laboratory results , which show that the @xmath17.0 , 8.5 , 17.4 , and 18.8 @xmath2 m emission features seen in dy cen - and other similar objects with pah - like dominated ir spectra - are attributable to proto - fullerenes or fullerene precursors rather than to c@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> dibs towards dy cen are normal for its reddening ; the only exception is the dib at 6284   ( possibly also the 7223  dib ) that is found to be unusually strong . </S>",
    "<S> we also report the detection of a new broad ( fwhm@xmath12  ) and unidentified feature centered at @xmath14000  . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this new band may be related to the circumstellar proto - fullerenes seen at infrared wavelengths . </S>"
