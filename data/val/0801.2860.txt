    "topological quantum computation ( tqc ) @xcite makes use of the subtle properties of topological phases of matter to provide an original implementation for quantum computation , better immune to decoherence .",
    "its main ingredients are anyonic excitations displaying non - abelian braiding statistics .",
    "although no direct experimental proof exists that such characteristics occurs in real physical systems , there are some evidence that , for instance , the @xmath1 fractional quantum hall effect states should be good candidates to display the expected properties .    up to now , contributions to the tqc field",
    "are mainly splitted into two parts , a `` hardware '' part whose main purpose is to find microscopic models , and possible experimental realizations displaying these topological features in their spectral properties , and a `` software '' part , which starts from a formal ( non - abelian ) anyon model , and defines , out of it , qubit states , quantum gates and algorithms .",
    "notice that this splitting is already present in more `` standard '' qantum computation , with on one hand the large effort devoted to built experimental implementations of sets of coupled qubits , and the quantum algorithm part , which in fact started first , and most often do not discriminate between the very different microscopic realizations for the qubits , supposing that a large amount of them are already available .    in the present paper ,",
    "we analyse a model with three fibonacci anyons ( irrespective of their implementation ) , and ask how their manipulation ( upon braiding ) can appropriately approximate the action of generic @xmath0 unitay transformations .",
    "as is well known ( @xcite ) , this is in principle possible to any desired accuracy , thank to the fact that the associated non - abelian braid group representation is dense in @xmath0 . to make this system interesting , it is also important that this can be done efficiently .",
    "such a task has yet been fulffilled @xcite by splitting the braid search into two distinct parts : first , a brute force search among all braids up to a given length to generate the closest matrix to the target one ; then , a refinement step done by iteratively implementing the solovay - kitaev algorithm @xcite . with additional fibonacci anyons ,",
    "it is possible to define more qubits , whose interaction results from appropriate braiding .",
    "for example , a universal set of quantum gates has been derived @xcite , with six anyons forming a two - qubit system , proving that it can in principle allows for quantum computation .    here",
    "an alternative approach is proposed , of rather different nature , in order to generate the @xmath0 elements . instead of",
    "first insisting on the dense @xmath0 covering generated by the fibonacci braid group generators , we start by analysing how good the latter can approximate the generators of binary polyhedral @xmath0 finite subgroups .",
    "it comes out that the subgroup of higher order , the binary icosahedral group @xmath2 with 120 elements , can indeed be very efficiently approached .",
    "recalling the isomorphism between @xmath0 and the 3-dimensional sphere @xmath3 , this already allows a fine grained description of @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , to the group @xmath2 corresponds the regular polytope @xmath4 @xcite , whose full symmetry group @xmath5 ( discrete subgroup of @xmath6 ) , has order @xmath7 .",
    "this already leads to an efficient way of generating @xmath7 @xmath0 unitary transformations , related by symmetry .",
    "we further show how to iteratively gets finer and finer meshes in @xmath0 by generating the so - called `` geodesic hyperdomes '' , the analogues with one dimension more , of the celebrated families of geodesic domes which provide fine discrete approximations of the usual sphere @xmath8 .    in a final part , a more `` disordered '' version of the latter step",
    "is described , which already provides an efficient speedup for `` brute - like '' search .",
    "fibonacci anyons are quasiparticles displaying non - abelian statistics upon braiding .",
    "we will not recall here the whole derivation of their properties , which can be found elsewhere @xcite , but only summarize what is used in the present context .",
    "what we need here is an expression for the two generators of the associated ( non - abelian ) 2-dimensional representation of the braid group @xmath9 .",
    "a close inspection of the braiding and fusion rules , taking into account the need to satisfy the so - called pentagon and hexagon equations , allows to find a set of generators .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite , a qubit ( 2-level ) system can be associated with three fibonacci anyons , with a third state ( called `` non computational '' ) , which is not coupled to the first two upon anyons braiding .",
    "we shall therefore focus to the @xmath0 unitary action ( up to a global phase ) onto the qubit space .      generally speaking , a representation of the braid group @xmath10 has @xmath11 generators @xmath12 satisfying the following two simple relations @xmath13    which already limits the set of possible @xmath12 matrices .",
    "fibonacci fusion rules constrains further this set , which eventually leads to the following unique ( up to a phase ) solution in the @xmath9 case :    @xmath14    with @xmath15 the inverse golden mean .",
    "note that @xmath16 and @xmath17 both satisfy    @xmath18    now , any braid is represented as a product of the @xmath12 generators .",
    "it allows also for an unambigous graphical presentation , where @xmath12 is displayed as a crossing between braid lines @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( see for example figure [ fig : braid_graph_st ] ) .",
    "a word of caution should be given here concerning the braid ordering .",
    "braid words are literally given and drawn here , as usual , with time flowing from left to right .",
    "quantum qubit states however are represented as column vectors acted on the left by unitary matrices . therefore , to build the unitary matrix corresponding to a braid word",
    "requires to reverse the order from the braid word to the associated matrix product .      due to the @xmath21 homomorphism between @xmath0 and @xmath22 , discrete @xmath0 subgroups",
    "have a counterpart as point groups in @xmath23 .",
    "let us focus here on the binary tetrahedral @xmath24 ( order 24 ) , octahedral @xmath25 ( order 48 ) and icosahedral @xmath2 ( order 120 ) groups .",
    "when viewed as elements of @xmath3 , @xmath24 and @xmath2 correspond to the regular polytopes @xmath26 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the group presentations are given here together with sets of simple quaternions generators ( see appendix a for a brief presentation of quaternions )    * binary tetrahedral group @xmath24 @xmath27 * binary octahedral group @xmath25 @xmath28 * binary icosahedral group @xmath2 @xmath29      we recalled above that the braid group @xmath9 representation with fibonacci anyons is dense in @xmath0 .",
    "we now question the possibility of generating the binary icosahedral subgroup by imposing some constraints on the words generated with @xmath30 . trying to build new generators @xmath31 and @xmath32 from @xmath30 , which would follow the above recalled generating relations for @xmath2",
    ", we eventually find that , while two of the three relations are easily exactly fulfilled , the third one seems only asymptocally satisfied with longer and longer words .",
    "we call these cases \" ` pseudo - generators \" : a brute force search for best words up to length 10 already gives the following very good approximations :    a pseudo - generator @xmath33 @xmath34 and a pseudo - generator @xmath35    @xmath36    these two pseudo - generators are shown on figure [ fig : braid_graph_st ] . note that in the above two expressions , the numerical values are cut up to 6 or 7 digits ; but the @xmath31 and @xmath32 exact expressions , as products of the @xmath30 fibonacci generators , are such that @xmath37 is exact .",
    "finally the third binary icosahedral group generating relation is only almost fulfilled @xmath38     graphical representation for the pseudo - generators braids @xmath31 and @xmath32 , built as words in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 fibonacci generators .",
    "note that @xmath16 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) refers to crossing the upper ( resp .",
    "the middle ) braid with the middle ( resp .",
    "the lower ) braid , with the convention that the upper braid crosses `` on top '' of the lower braid ( the reverse case coding the inverse @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    ", width=192,height=96 ]    now , it is easy to build , with short words in the pseudo - generators @xmath41 , a set denoted @xmath42 corresponding to a very slightly deformed @xmath4 polytope .",
    "since @xmath41 do not exactly fulfill the @xmath2 generating relations , their span is in principle infinite .",
    "what we are doing in fact is to select , once for all , @xmath43 words in @xmath41 ( e.g. @xmath43 braids ) which very closely approximate the @xmath2 elements .",
    "the word length never exceeds 8 , which puts an upper bound of 80 to the length of the @xmath42 elements in terms of the original @xmath30 fibonacci generators .",
    "note that it may still be possible to find shorter words leading to a good approximation of @xmath2 , either by the process of word contraction , or by finding equivalent approximations by brute force search in the original generators .",
    "we are not interested here in absolute length minimization , but rather to describe a fine grid mesh based on discrete subgroup and geodesic hyperdome iterative generation ; we shall therefore stick to @xmath41 generated braids .",
    "we are going to build increasing sets @xmath44 and @xmath45 which are the images under the full @xmath5 group of seed sets of points ( denoted @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) inside the orthoscheme @xmath48 ( the @xmath5 group fundamental region , see appendix c ) .",
