    "while the existence of dark matter is now firmly established  @xcite , little is known about the properties of the particles that make up the dark matter , including their lifetime .",
    "the dark matter particles are often assumed to be perfectly stable as the result of a symmetry , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath1-parity in supersymmetric models .",
    "however , from the gravitational evidence for the existence of dark matter we can only infer directly that the dark matter has to be stable on timescales comparable to the age of the universe .",
    "measurements of cosmic - ray antimatter , gamma rays and neutrinos , on the other hand , typically impose much more stringent constraints on the dark matter lifetime in the respective decay channels  @xcite .    as with baryonic matter itself",
    ", there are good reasons to consider the case of unstable dark matter . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", we expect at least gravity to violate any global symmetry ( and in some cases the symmetry breaking takes place at a lower scale , as _",
    "e.g. _ in models of grand unification  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we can expect the presence of at least non - renormalisable operators in the theory allowing for dark matter decay .",
    "in other cases , the dark matter parity symmetry may be only approximate from the start or spontaneously broken , as it occurs in some models of @xmath1-parity breaking  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the coupling involved in the decay may be very strongly suppressed , as in the case of a tiny kinetic mixing between visible sector and hidden sector  @xcite . in those cases",
    "it is natural to expect a very long lifetime for the dark matter particle , which may exceed the age of the universe by many orders of magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , even for such extremely long lifetimes the decay signals may be in the observable range  @xcite .",
    "another important clue in relation to decaying dark matter is the observation of several excesses in the fluxes of cosmic rays in the energy region above a few gev .",
    "namely , the pamela experiment observed a steep rise in the positron fraction extending up to at least 100@xmath0gev  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the experiments fermi lat , h.e.s.s . and atic measured the total @xmath2 flux , finding that this flux is harder than expected and falls off steeply above 1 tev  @xcite .",
    "such signals can be well explained by the decay of dark matter particles in the galactic halo if the decays are sufficiently `` leptophilic , '' such that one may avoid the overproduction of antiprotons .",
    "in fact , the observed antiproton flux is in complete agreement with the flux expected from production by spallation of cosmic rays  @xcite . regarding the mass of the decaying particle , the pamela data require it to be larger than 200@xmath0gev since the rise in the positron fraction extends up to at least 100@xmath0gev , while the fermi and h.e.s.s",
    ". measurements of the total @xmath2 flux indicate a mass of a few tev , depending on the background  @xcite and the particular decay modes . the electron flux from dark matter decay required to fit the data points towards a lifetime of around @xmath3@xmath0s in all cases  @xcite .",
    "similar signatures can also be generated by annihilating dark matter , but in this case some tension with the constraints coming from the measurement of radio emissions from the centre of the galaxy  @xcite and from inverse compton scattering with starlight and the cosmic microwave background  @xcite is present .",
    "note that astrophysical explanations for the positron excess have also been put forward  @xcite , the most popular being one or several nearby pulsars as additional sources of electrons and positrons .",
    "the decay of dark matter particles is an interesting and viable explanation of the observed electron anomalies , and it is worthwhile trying to confirm or exclude this possibility by a complementary examination of other indirect detection channels , in particular neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "neutrinos , from this perspective , have two clear advantages .",
    "firstly , they are unaffected by magnetic fields and thus , like photons , allow to reconstruct the direction of their origin ; therefore they would offer a clear way to distinguish between the cases of annihilating and decaying dark matter , as well as pulsar interpretations of the signal ( even assuming that the pulsars produce also neutrinos in the energy range considered ) .",
    "secondly , they are typically produced along with or from the decay of the charged leptons in many `` leptophilic '' decaying dark matter models  @xcite . in such cases , therefore , the flux of neutrinos is correlated with the other cosmic - ray signals , and their spectrum may give direct information on the dark matter decay channel .",
    "in particular , choosing the mass and lifetime of the dark matter particle such as to yield a good agreement with the pamela positron excess , one can directly predict the rates for the corresponding neutrino signal and look for it in present and future experiments .",
    "these are the two advantages we will try to exploit in this paper .",
    "on the other hand , neutrinos also suffer from some clear disadvantages with respect to other indirect detection channels : the large atmospheric neutrino background makes it difficult to disentangle any signal up to tev energies for the lifetimes indicated by the cosmic - ray anomalies mentioned above .",
    "a further disadvantage is the necessity of very large detectors to measure the comparably small neutrino fluxes expected from dark matter decay .",
    "fortunately , new large neutrino detectors , namely icecube and possibly km3net , will become fully operational in the near future and may allow to detect even the small signals we discuss here .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section  [ fluxes ] we will discuss the neutrino flux expected from decaying dark matter in our galaxy and compare it with the one from dark matter annihilation in order to discuss the best strategy for the detection of the signal in these two cases . in section  [ spectra ] , we will present the spectral signatures for a number of different dark matter decay modes . in section  [ bounds ]",
    "we will give the present bounds from neutrino experiments and the expected rates for present and future neutrino detectors .",
    "we will also discuss the prospects for distinguishing between different neutrino spectra in case a signal is detected .",
    "we will finally present our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we concentrate in this section on the neutrino flux expected from the dark matter in the milky way halo , since on one hand it is the dominant source , and on the other hand it has a nontrivial directionality that may be exploited , as in the case of gamma rays  @xcite , to disentangle the different hypotheses of dark matter decay versus annihilation .",
    "in addition , an isotropic extragalactic component is expected from unresolved cosmological sources , which in the case of decaying dark matter is of the same order of magnitude as the halo contribution , so that it may increase the overall signal by a factor of two or so .",
    "this extragalactic component is expected to be negligible in the case of dark matter annihilation .",
    "[ [ decaying - dark - matter ] ] decaying dark matter + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    for the case of decaying dark matter particles in the halo , the differential flux of neutrinos is given by the following integral along the line of sight : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the lifetime and the mass of the decaying particle , @xmath7 is the neutrino energy spectrum from the decay and @xmath8 is the dark matter density in the halo .",
    "adopting for @xmath8 the nfw density profile , we obtain for the averaged full - sky flux @xmath9 with the local halo density @xmath10@xmath0gev@xmath0@xmath11 , the solar distance from the galactic centre @xmath12@xmath0kpc and @xmath13@xmath0kpc .",
    "the numerical result is only weakly dependent on the halo parameters and the profile .",
    "the flux is inversely proportional to the product of the dark matter particle mass and lifetime .",
    "thus , for a fixed lifetime the flux is inversely proportional to the dark matter mass @xmath6 due to the lower number density of dark matter particles for higher masses .",
    "[ [ annihilating - dark - matter ] ] annihilating dark matter + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    for an annihilating particle , the differential flux of neutrinos is instead given by the following integral along the line of sight : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath6 are the dark matter annihilation cross - section and the dark matter mass , @xmath7 is the neutrino spectrum from annihilation instead of decay , and the line - of - sight integral , in this case , contains the square of the halo density .",
    "it is therefore clear that for the same halo profile the annihilating dark matter signal is strongly enhanced towards the centre of the galaxy , especially for cuspy halo profiles .",
    "[ [ propagation ] ] propagation + + + + + + + + + + +    after the neutrinos are produced in the decay or annihilation of dark matter particles , they travel in straight lines through the galaxy , essentially without any interactions .",
    "the only modifications to the fluxes during this time are due to flavour oscillations  @xcite .",
    "in fact , using the experimental best - fit values for the neutrino mixing angles , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18  @xcite , and neglecting possible cp - violating effects , the neutrino oscillation probabilities in vacuum are given by @xmath19 thus , a primary neutrino flux in a specific flavour is redistributed almost equally into all neutrino flavours during propagation and any flavour information is lost . on the other hand , this means that nearly the same signal is present in any flavour and may allow to choose the best channel for discovery according to the background and efficiency of the detector .",
    "let us now discuss the background for our neutrino signal .",
    "the main background for the observation of neutrinos in the gev to tev range are neutrinos produced in cosmic - ray interactions with the earth s atmosphere .",
    "here we use the atmospheric neutrino fluxes calculated by honda _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . the theoretical uncertainty of these fluxes is estimated to be better than 25@xmath0% in the gev to tev range , while the uncertainty in the ratio of the different flavours is significantly smaller .",
    "we extend the atmospheric neutrino fluxes to energies above 10@xmath0tev using the slopes given by volkova _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "conventional electron and muon neutrinos are directly produced from pion and kaon decays . while electron neutrinos are practically unaffected by neutrino oscillations due to the large oscillation length , muon neutrinos , particularly at low energies , can be converted into tau neutrinos and provide the dominant tau neutrino background at energies below 1@xmath0tev .",
    "the conversion probability of muon neutrinos into tau neutrinos is given by @xmath20 in this expression , @xmath21 is the neutrino energy and @xmath22 is their propagation length after being produced in the atmosphere , which is given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 @xmath0 km being the earth s radius and @xmath25 @xmath0 km the mean altitude at which atmospheric neutrinos are produced .",
    "in addition to the conventional atmospheric neutrino flux from pion and kaon decays there is a prompt neutrino flux from the decay of charmed particles that are also produced in cosmic - ray collisions with the atmosphere .",
    "the prompt neutrinos have a harder spectrum than the conventional ones and therefore dominate at higher energies ( roughly above 10@xmath0tev for electron neutrinos and above 100@xmath0tev for muon neutrinos ) . since these contributions are not well understood and in any case subdominant in the energy range that is of interest here , we neglect them in the present study .",
    "on the other hand , the prompt tau neutrinos start to dominate around 1@xmath0tev ( and at even smaller energies for downgoing neutrinos ) .",
    "thus we include this contribution using the parametrisation  @xcite @xmath26 = -a+bx - cx^2-dx^3,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this parametrisation is valid in the energy range of 100@xmath0gev up to 1@xmath0pev .",
    "however , we point out that compared to the conventional atmospheric neutrino flux the prompt flux suffers from larger uncertainties .",
    "other neutrino backgrounds in the considered energy range are neutrinos produced in cosmic - ray interactions with the solar corona  @xcite and those produced in cosmic - ray interactions with the interstellar medium in the milky way  @xcite . while the former is subdominant in diffuse searches for all flavours  @xcite and can be excluded from the analysis by excluding neutrinos from the direction of the sun , the latter represents an irreducible , ill - understood neutrino background for searches in the galactic disc direction .",
    "in fact , the flux of galactic neutrinos is expected to become comparable to the atmospheric electron neutrino background for the galactic disc direction and energies in the tev range .      in view of the subdominant neutrino signals from dark matter",
    "decays it is important to devise strategies that reduce the background . in",
    "@xcite it was proposed to use directionality in order to reduce the background in the tau neutrino channel .",
    "this is possible since the tau neutrino background at low energies comes mainly from the muon neutrino oscillation and is therefore strongly suppressed in the zenith direction .",
    "some of the authors of  @xcite propose instead to search for an enhanced muon neutrino signal only in the direction of the galactic centre .",
    "however , taking into account the typically low neutrino event rates , it is not always the best strategy to optimise the signal - to - background ratio . instead , the statistical significance @xmath32 ( number of signal events divided by the square root of the number of background events ) is a better measure for comparing different detection strategies .        in figure  [ gcdirection ]",
    "we show the significance of the signal as a function of the cone half angle around the galactic centre normalised to the significance of the full - sky observation . here",
    "we assume a background that ( practically ) does not depend on galactic coordinates like atmospheric neutrinos and neglect the contribution of galactic neutrinos , which is subdominant in the case of muon neutrinos .",
    "we see clearly that for annihilating dark matter the best way to detect the signal is indeed looking towards the galactic centre : the cone half angle offering the best signal - to - square root of background ratio varies depending on the cuspiness of the profile , but it is always between @xmath33 ( nfw ) and @xmath34 ( isothermal ) .",
    "note that in any case the gain of looking at the galactic centre is not very large for a cored profile like the isothermal one .    for the case of decaying dark matter on the other hand ,",
    "the best strategy is to measure the full - sky signal and not concentrate on the region around the galactic centre .",
    "in fact the gain coming from the enhanced dark matter density is counteracted by the smallness of the collecting area and so the significance of the signal goes quickly to zero as a function of the angle for any profile , even for cuspy profiles like the nfw profile .",
    "the observation of only a fraction of the sky around the galactic centre direction leads to an increase in the signal - to - background ratio , but not of the significance .",
    "we therefore conclude that for decaying dark matter there is no advantage in looking only at the galactic centre .",
    "the full - sky signal offers not only better statistics , but also a higher significance .    considering the directionality of the atmospheric background instead of the signal , another good strategy might be to exploit the fact that the flux from the zenith direction is ( dependent on the energy ) a few times smaller than from the horizontal direction . assuming a signal that does not depend on the zenith angle , the observation of only a fraction of the sky around the zenith direction is again clearly leading to an increase in the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "also in this case though , it turns out that the best value for the significance is achieved for a full - sky observation .",
    "we can therefore conclude that exploiting the directionality of the signal or background , apart from the case of specific flavours like the tau neutrino discussed in  @xcite , is not promising for the first detection of decaying dark matter .",
    "the largest rate and significance is achieved for a full - sky search , and this is the option we will discuss in the following . on the other hand , directionality offers a clear way to disentangle decaying dark matter from either annihilating dark matter , where looking into the galactic centre should give an increase in significance , or from point sources like dwarf galaxies , pulsars and supernova remnants .",
    "the neutrino spectra depend on the decay channel of the dark matter particle .",
    "the simplest possibility is a direct decay into two neutrinos for a scalar particle or into @xmath35 for a fermion .",
    "then the resulting spectrum is just a monochromatic line for the galactic signal and an integral of the redshifted line from the extragalactic signal ( and a continuum contribution from the fragmentation of the @xmath36 boson in the case of decay into @xmath35 ) .",
    "so for this case we have the simple spectra @xmath37 where @xmath38 and we have assumed here that the mass of @xmath39 is negligible .",
    "@xmath40 is the ratio of the extragalactic and the galactic signal , which is a number of order one given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the ratio of the dark energy density and the matter density in the universe .",
    "another characteristic spectrum is that obtained from a three - body decay into three leptons @xmath43 , which has the familiar triangular shape when plotted on a logarithmic axis .",
    "is equal to 3/4 , yielding the same neutrino energy spectrum . ] in this case the expression for the extragalactic signal is more involved , but it still appears as a softer triangular shape which dominates at low energies , as can be seen from the change in slope for the three - body spectra in figures  [ spectra - plot ] and  [ spectra - plot2 ] .",
    "we show here as an example the spectrum of the decay of a fermionic dark matter particle mediated by a heavy scalar particle , corresponding to a scalar - type 4-fermion interaction .",
    "finally , a continuous neutrino spectrum is generated by any heavy particle that decays into neutrinos , like the muon , or fragments into charged pions , like the electroweak gauge bosons or the tau lepton .",
    "we use here as examples of continuum neutrino spectra , the spectra arising from the decay of a scalar particle into longitudinal gauge bosons similar to the higgs decay and from the decay of a fermionic chiral lepton into @xmath44 .",
    "we use pythia 6.4  @xcite to simulate the gauge boson fragmentation and the heavy leptonic decays .",

    "we see that for a lifetime of the order of @xmath3@xmath0s , which is the order of magnitude suggested by the pamela excess  @xcite , the signal always lies below the measured background of muon neutrinos .",
    "the best signal - to - background ratio is achieved for the high - energy end of the spectrum , which gives information about the mass scale of the decaying particle .",
    "the neutrino spectra shown in figures  [ spectra - plot ] and  [ spectra - plot2 ] look rather distinctive , and an interesting question is whether they can be disentangled in a neutrino detector .",
    "we have to consider that neutrino detectors do not really measure neutrinos directly , but the corresponding charged leptons or showers , produced in the interactions of neutrinos with the intervening matter .",
    "since we are interested in neutrino energies much larger than nucleon masses we only take into account deep inelastic neutrino  nucleon scattering .",
    "electron elastic scattering is subdominant in this energy range and will be neglected .",
    "the cross - sections for deep inelastic scattering of ( anti)neutrinos off nucleons at rest are given by @xmath53 with @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 for charged - current interactions , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 for neutral - current interactions  @xcite .",
    "the inelasticity @xmath62 is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the energy of the generated lepton and @xmath65 is the energy of the generated hadronic shower .",
    "equation  ( [ crosssection ] ) holds only for neutrino energies up to the tev region when the effect of the massive gauge boson propagators can not be neglected anymore . for higher energies",
    "the cross - sections are overestimated .    for the total neutrino ",
    "nucleon cross - sections one obtains @xmath66 as we can see , the total cross - section is proportional to the energy of the incoming neutrino in the considered energy range .      the charged - current deep inelastic scattering of a muon neutrino off a nucleus produces a hadronic shower and a muon .",
    "these track - like events can be clearly identified in cherenkov detectors via the cherenkov light cone of the relativistic muon .      since muons are rather long - lived ( @xmath67 m ) , their range is only limited by energy loss during their passage through matter and not by their lifetime .",
    "therefore cherenkov detectors can also observe muons that are generated in the surrounding material of the detector .",
    "this effect enhances the effective detector area for high - energy muon neutrinos .",
    "the average rate of muon energy loss can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 describes the ionisation energy loss and @xmath70 takes into account the energy loss due to radiative processes : @xmath71 pair production , bremsstrahlung and photonuclear contributions .",
    "both @xmath69 and @xmath70 are slowly varying functions of the muon energy . as long as we can approximate @xmath72 and @xmath73 as energy - independent , the average range after which the muon energy drops below a threshold energy @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 ,    \\label{muonrange}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the density of the medium .",
    "the relevant parameters for standard rock , water and ice are given in table  [ materials ] .",
    "the values of the density and the average proton - number - to - mass - number ratio are taken from  @xcite .",
    "the muon energy loss parameters given in the table are best - fit values from the fit of equation  ( [ muonrange ] ) to the tabulated data in  @xcite .",
    ".density , proton - number - to - mass - number ratio and approximate muon energy loss parameters for the materials of interest in cherenkov detectors . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on the other hand , discriminating between the spectra for the different channels will not be so straightforward , especially if the mass of the decaying particle is unknown .",
    "after convolution with the energy resolution , the two - body , three - body or continuum spectra appear quite similar , especially within their statistical error , but their significance peaks at slightly different values for the same dark matter mass .",
    "note , though , that the signal from a neutrino line remains steeper than the other ones at the edge and it may be possible to distinguish it with sufficient statistics . in this respect",
    "the more promising strategy is probably exploiting the better energy resolution of the shower events , if they can be detected .",
    "in general a comparison between the different types of events , through - going , contained and cascade - like , will make disentangling the shape of the spectra easier .",
    "moreover , if the dark matter mass is measured via another channel , like gamma - rays , it may be possible to exploit this information in the neutrino fit and compare the position of the neutrino signal `` peak '' in the data with the expectation .",
    "this should help in disentangling at least a continuum spectrum from the two- and perhaps also three - body decay cases .",
    "for this specific strategy probably one of the most promising dark matter candidates would be a fermion , which may decay into a leptonic three - body final state and subdominantly into @xmath77 , as _",
    "e.g. _ gravitino dark matter with trilinear @xmath1-parity breaking  @xcite .",
    "then , if the @xmath78-channel is suppressed by 23 orders of magnitude compared to a leptonic three - body decay , the gamma - ray and neutrino experiments will actually be exploring the same range of lifetimes . in this case",
    "an observation of a gamma line by fermi will provide the dark matter mass measurement and the neutrino signal with a much shorter lifetime will point at a three - body or @xmath35 dominant decay . in case both signals in gamma - rays and neutrinos",
    "are measured , it may be possible to disentangle also between a scalar and a fermionic dark matter candidate , which seems to be very difficult from neutrino measurements alone , since the two types of particles produce very similar spectra within the energy resolution of the detectors , as can be seen comparing figures  [ significance1a ] , [ significance2a ] and [ significance3a ] with figures  [ significance4a ] , [ significance5a ] and [ significance6a ] .",
    "we have studied in this paper the possible neutrino signals from decaying dark matter , considering different decay channels and spectra , both for a scalar and a fermionic candidate .",
    "we have concentrated here on the region of parameter space that is preferred in order to explain the pamela positron excess and shown that in this case a signal may soon be visible at neutrino observatories .",
    "the non - observation of such a signal will put rather strong constraints on the leptophilic decaying dark matter explanation of the excess , except for the decay into @xmath71 where no signal in neutrinos is expected . in this sense",
    "neutrino observations are complementary to other astrophysical constraints coming from radio frequencies and inverse compton emission , which are more sensitive to the electron channel .",
    "a neutrino signal will allow to disentangle between decaying and annihilating dark matter , by comparing the signal towards and away from the galactic centre  @xcite , and also between dark matter and astrophysical sources .",
    "more difficult is the identification of the dark matter decay channels , since all neutrino spectra finally result in a broad peak in the muon spectrum .",
    "however , the analysis of cascade - like events , which contain in principle all the neutrino energy and have the advantage of a better energy resolution , may improve the situation and allow with sufficient statistics to disentangle at least a line - like feature .",
    "also , the neutrino signal alone can not distinguish between scalar and fermionic dark matter candidates since the resulting spectra are very similar in the two cases .",
    "on the other hand , for some of the decay channels discussed here , like the ones with a @xmath79 gauge boson in the final state , corresponding signals are also expected in gamma rays and antiprotons and may provide additional information on the model parameters and a cross - check of the decay channel . even for the pure leptophilic channels , gamma rays from final state radiation or from subdominant decays may play an important role in discriminating between models due to the better sensitivity in the gamma - ray channel .",
    "in general , neutrino observations offer complementary information and can be used to test also models where the gamma - ray signal is strongly suppressed compared to the leptonic one .",
    "the next generation of neutrino experiments can therefore be expected to yield some very interesting results .",
