    "@xmath0 coronae borealis ( @xmath0  crb , hip 78459 ) , a well - studied g0v star with an estimated mass of 1.0@xmath2 and an age of 10gyr , was among the first stars identified with an extrasolar planet ( esp ) candidate ( * ? ? ? * hereafter n97 ) .",
    "if the mass of the companion , @xmath5 , is small relative to @xmath0  crb , the system s mass function indicates that @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the orbital inclination . for a random distribution of orbital plane inclinations ,",
    "the expectation value of @xmath5 is @xmath8 , justifying the interpretation that @xmath0  crb s companion is an esp .",
    "subsequently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ghb ) used data from _ hipparcos _ and the ground - based multichannel astrometric photometer @xcite to measure the astrometric signature of the reflex motion of @xmath0  crb .",
    "they derived an astrometric orbit with a semi - major axis of @xmath9mas and an inclination of @xmath10 , indicating that the companion is a late type m - dwarf star with mass @xmath1@xmath2 . in a large sample of esp candidates ,",
    "only a few systems seen at low inclinations are expected .",
    "it was therefore surprising that , in a companion paper , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hbg ) found , by combining _ hipparcos _",
    "data with the spectroscopic orbital elements of 30 esp candidates , that a significant fraction may have small inclinations .",
    "the semi - major axes of the orbits that hbg derived are , however , at the limits of the precision of _ hipparcos _ measurements . @xcite",
    "and @xcite demonstrated that in these circumstances the small @xmath7 s were an artifact of hbg s analysis .",
    "indeed , @xcite hst astrometric observation of @xmath11 cnc ( 55 cnc ) , a star estimated by hbg to have a particularly low inclination orbit , placed an upper limit on its reflex motion , confirming that its companion is sub - stellar .",
    "we have been using high - resolution infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy to detect low - mass companions in spectroscopic binaries first identified in visible light ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m02 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p02 ) ) .",
    "if @xmath0  crb s companion had the mass of a late m spectral type main - sequence star , we expected it to lie within the sensitivity limits of the technique ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we describe here our search for the companion in the @xmath0  crb system by ir spectroscopy . ",
    "2 details extension of the ir technique to @xmath0  crb , our observations , and data reduction . in ",
    "3 we describe our analysis and the measurements of @xmath0  crb . in  4 we set an upper bound on the 1.6@xmath3 flux of @xmath0  crb s companion .",
    "we calculate an upper limit on the companion mass using theoretical models and comment on the significance of our result in  5 .",
    "we observed @xmath0  crb during four runs in the spring of 2001 ( see table  1 ) with the w. m. keck observatory s cross - dispersed echelle ir spectrometer nirspec @xcite on the keck ii telescope with and without adaptive optics ( ao ) .",
    "we used nirspec in its high resolution mode centered at 1.555@xmath3 .",
    "this provided 9 spectral orders , 45    53 , from 1.450  ",
    "1.705@xmath3 with resolutions of 28,000 and 35,000 in non - ao and ao modes respectively , for a 2 pixel slit width .",
    "further details of the instrument setup and observation procedure are given in p02 .",
    "we extracted the spectra using the redspec software package , and determined the dispersion solution using oh emission lines of the night sky , recorded simultaneously with the observations and identified from the catalog of @xcite , and arc lamp spectra .",
    "application of the ir spectroscopic technique to the detection of low mass secondaries requires good templates for the primary and the secondary .",
    "observations of these templates took place during 2000 and 2001 ( p02 ) . prior to this",
    "work ( e.g. , p02 , m02 ) , we used spectra in only nirspec order 49 because it is nearly completely free of terrestrial absorption .",
    "however , the sensitivity of our analysis depends on the number of stellar spectral lines available and hence on the spectral range of the data . to reach the low flux levels expected for @xmath0  crb s companion we used additional spectral orders",
    ". figure  [ fig01 ] shows the spectrum of the a0 star hd 13372 in orders 45    53 .",
    "the stellar spectrum contains only weak , broad lines of the hydrogen brackett series ; all other absorption shown in the figure is terrestrial .",
    "the absence of terrestrial absorption in order 49 is apparent .",
    "order 46 contains terrestrial absorption in the p and q branches of a @xmath12 band ; orders 47 and 48 contain @xmath13 absorption lines .",
    "orders 51    53 , and to a lesser extent order 50 , are contaminated by many terrestrial absorption lines . in order 45 , with our choice of central wavelength ,",
    "starlight illuminated the array in only one of the two telescope nod positions .",
    "we concentrated , therefore , on trying to correct atmospheric absorption only in the spectra of orders 46 , 47 , and 48 .",
    "terrestrial absorption lines are usually removed by dividing the target spectrum by a featureless stellar spectrum observed nearly simultaneously at the same airmass .",
    "we took a different approach because we had to correct many template spectra obtained in different observing sessions .",
    "we expect that the @xmath13 and @xmath12 absorption bands are independent of weather and vary only with airmass .",
    "we therefore obtained nirspec spectra of five a0 stars on july 17 , 2002 , over the range of airmasses of our @xmath0  crb and template spectra .",
    "we removed the brackett lines by fitting them with lorentzian profiles and used the terrestrial absorption lines in orders 46 , 47 , and 48 to register each observation on a sub - pixel scale .",
    "for each of the terrestrial lines , we fitted the dependence of the absorption on airmass , and were thus able to calculate terrestrial absorption spectra at the exact airmasses of the @xmath0  crb and template spectra .",
    "this procedure worked well for order 47 and less well in orders 46 and 48 , probably because their telluric lines are deeper and have more complex structure than those in order 47 .",
    "the residuals in orders 46 and 48 appear in only a few percent or less of free spectral range of these orders so we considered them negligible .",
    "figure  [ fig02 ] shows the order 46  ",
    "49 @xmath0  crb spectra measured on june 2 , 2001 , with orders 46 , 47 , and 48 corrected for telluric absorption .    to ensure consistent results , we reextracted orders 46    49 for the entire template set , calculated the dispersion solution using the oh lines of the night sky , corrected the spectra for terrestrial absorption , and rederived the stellar radial velocities following the technique described in p02 .",
    "figures  [ fig03 ]    [ fig06 ] show the template spectra for orders 46    49 in the laboratory reference frame , with the terrestrial absorption lines removed from orders 46 , 47 , and 48 .",
    "our procedure to search for evidence of @xmath0  crb s companion is similar to that described by m02 for spectroscopic binaries using the two - dimensional cross - correlation routine todcor @xcite .",
    "the analysis identifies the templates that provide the best matching primary and secondary , the ratio of the secondary and primary fluxes , @xmath14 , and the radial velocities of the components .",
    "the measured amplitude of @xmath0  crb s reflex velocity is 67@xmath15 ( n97 ) .",
    "if its companion had the 0.14@xmath2 mass reported by ghb , the maximum velocity difference of the primary and secondary would be 0.4@xmath16 . this is less than the 1@xmath16 velocity precision of our technique ( p02 ) , so we did not expect to detect a velocity difference . to obtain",
    "a velocity difference large enough for us to detect reliably , @xmath17@xmath16 , would require that the companion have mass @xmath18@xmath2 ; the flux of such a substellar object blended with a g star would be too small for us to detect spectroscopically .",
    "we therefore regarded the velocity difference of the components as fixed at 0 and focused on measuring the system s flux ratio .",
    "we wrote a routine to model binaries from pairs of templates at prescribed flux ratios , to cross - correlate them with our @xmath0  crb spectra , and to identify the model most closely matching @xmath0  crb . with this , we analyzed separately the @xmath0  crb spectra in orders 46    49 for each of the four observing sessions using a wide selection of templates .",
    "the highest correlation values resulted from using hd  4614 or gl  160 for the primary template , depending on the particular @xmath0  crb spectrum , and the late m - type templates for the secondary . changing",
    "the secondary spectral type by a few subclasses resulted in negligible changes in the correlation , and we concluded that we could only discriminate between early and late type m - star secondaries . based on this , we averaged the @xmath14 s resulting from the late type secondaries gl  406 , lhs  292 , gl  644c , lhs  2351 , and lhs  2065 for each @xmath0  crb spectrum .",
    "these averaged values are our measured flux ratios and are listed in table  2 .",
    "the arithmetic mean of the measured flux ratios in table  2 is @xmath190.0034 .",
    "this small value , and the large scatter around it , from @xmath190.0260 to 0.0164 , suggest that the observations have not detected the companion .",
    "the primary and secondary templates are not likely to match exactly the effective temperature and metallicity of the @xmath0  crb primary and companion .",
    "the fact that the average flux ratio is essentially zero indicates that any such mismatch is not causing a systematic error .    to interpret the apparent non - detection we must derive an upper bound , at a specified level of significance , on the flux ratio .",
    "the conventional approach would be to calculate the mean of the measured flux ratios in table  2 , to assume they follow a gaussian distribution and derive the standard deviation of the mean , and to use this to place confidence limits on an upper bound .",
    "the measured flux ratios , however , do not necessarily follow a gaussian distribution , and the number of measurements , 16 , is too few to test the assumption reliably .",
    "we chose , therefore , to take a different approach , using the data itself to model a large number of observations , and from these directly measure the probabilities of a detection at a certain flux ratio , independent of underlying statistical assumptions .",
    " 4 describes this approach .",
    "in this section , we estimate the upper bound on the ratio of the companion s flux to that of @xmath0  crb  that follows from the measurements in table  2 .",
    "our approach starts by analyzing sets of model binaries . to ensure the models closely represented the original observations",
    ", we used the observed @xmath0  crb spectra as the basis for the model primaries .",
    "we subdivided each observed @xmath0  crb spectrum at wavelengths where there are no lines , into smaller sections with lengths from 10 to 60 .",
    "we reassembled these sections in random sequences to create a set of 500 unique model primaries for each observation , with absorption lines , noise characteristics , and free spectral range identical to the original @xmath0  crb spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig07 ] shows examples of reassembled model primaries derived from the january 2001 @xmath0  crb spectra .",
    "we used the m7 spectral type star lhs  2351 for the secondary in all of the models , and combined it , unmodified , with the randomized primaries at eight flux ratio values , from 0.001    0.020 , to create the model binary spectra .",
    "this provided us with 128 sets ( 4 observations @xmath20 4 orders @xmath20 8 flux ratios ) of 500 model binaries each , with which to evaluate the measured flux ratios in table  2 .",
    "we analyzed the model binaries in the same way as the original @xmath0  crb spectra (  [ analysis ] ) .",
    "for each set of models , we cut and reassembled a matching set of primary templates from either hd  4614 or gl  160 , depending on which was used in the corresponding @xmath0  crb analysis .",
    "we restricted the analysis to only the m6.5 spectral type star lhs  292 for the secondary template because the correlation value is insensitive to small changes in the secondary spectral type (  [ analysis ] ) .",
    "the analysis produced 500 `` measured '' flux ratios for each of the 128 sets of models . for a given set of models , the measured flux ratios scattered around the input value .",
    "figure  [ fig08 ] shows two of these distributions from january 2001 , order 49 , @xmath21 , along with the corresponding measured value of @xmath190.0046 from table  2 .",
    "from each of our model distributions we can determine the probability that the corresponding @xmath0  crb observation returns a flux ratio as small as the one measured .",
    "consider , for example , the results for january 2001 , order 49 . if the actual flux ratio were 0.010 , the probability that the observation and its analysis produces a flux ratio as small as the one measured , @xmath190.0046 , is given by the number of model binaries that returned flux ratios of equal value or smaller .",
    "figure  8a shows the model distribution derived for this case ; 24 out of 500 models ( probability=0.048 ) produced an @xmath14 smaller than @xmath190.0046 .",
    "if , then , the true @xmath14 were 0.010 , the probability of a measurement producing a value as low as or lower than @xmath190.0046 is unlikely , and we could consider 0.010 an upper bound with 95% confidence @xmath22 .",
    "suppose that instead the true @xmath14 were smaller , 0.005 . in this case",
    ", a larger number of models , now 76 out of 500 , or 15% , give an @xmath14 as small as the measured one ( figure  8b ) . we would therefore consider 0.005 as an upper bound with only 85% confidence .    for each of the 16 modeled observations , we calculated , at the eight input model flux ratios , the probability of measuring a flux ratio as low as or lower than the measured value in table  2 . to combine those probability values into one value",
    ", we use fisher s method to combine independent @xmath23-values @xcite . in this method ,",
    "one first calculates the product of probabilities .",
    "this value , according to @xcite , is distributed in a known way , and we can use its known distribution to infer the new probability .",
    "the product value , @xmath24 , is @xmath25 @xcite showed that the statistic @xmath26 has a @xmath27 distribution with @xmath28 degrees of freedom .",
    "following fisher s recipe , we use this known distribution to calculate @xmath29 , the combined @xmath23-value from the 16 probabilities .",
    "figure  [ fig09 ] shows @xmath29 as a function of input flux ratio .",
    "the combined probability curve intersects the 99% confidence level at @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , the flux ratio 0.0024 can be ruled out with 90% confidence .",
    "we consider the flux ratio from 1.55 to 1.65@xmath3 as equivalent to that in the @xmath4-band because spectra of late m dwarfs between 1.4 and 1.7@xmath3 are not marked by the very deep h@xmath31o absorption characteristic of l spectral type dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the 2mass @xmath4-band magnitude of @xmath0  crb is 3.99 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with its _ hipparcos _ v magnitude , 5.39 ( hip 78459 ) , and the @xmath32 color , 1.36 , for a gov spectral type star @xcite . with the _ hipparcos _ distance of @xmath33pc , @xmath0  crb s absolute h - band magnitude",
    "is @xmath34 .",
    "the flux ratio upper bound (  4.2 ) therefore corresponds to an @xmath4-band brightness limit for the companion of @xmath35 at the 99% confidence level and @xmath36 at the 90% confidence level .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows the absolute h magnitude versus mass , 10gyr isochrone calculated by @xcite for low mass stars and brown dwarfs , with the model values for masses less than 0.1@xmath2 updated from @xcite . at the scale of the figure ,",
    "the 5gyr isochrone is indistinguishable from the one for 10gyr .",
    "we also plot the locations of main - sequence dwarfs whose masses have been measured dynamically ; the references are cited in the figure caption . for reference",
    ", the figure shows the ( companion / primary ) flux ratio upper bounds calculated in  [ upperlimit ] .",
    "the flux ratio upper bound at the 99% confidence level , @xmath30 , falls at @xmath37@xmath2 , close to ghb s reported mass of the companion , @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "similarly , @xmath38 sets an upper bound on the mass of @xmath39@xmath2 with 90% confidence .",
    "while these mass upper bounds do not provide either a definitive confirmation or rejection of ghb s reported mass of the companion , they do suggest strongly that its mass is smaller than their value .",
    "the analysis described in  3 and  4 , and illustrated by the histograms in figure  [ fig08 ] shows that , by increasing the spectral range through the use of several orders , the ir spectroscopic technique can detect binaries with 1.6@xmath3 flux ratios in the range of 0.01 to 0.02 . this is a significant advance over our previous detections at flux ratios of 0.04 to 0.05 ( mazeh et al .",
    "\\1 ) our measurements set upper limits of 0.0024 and 0.005 on the ratio of the @xmath40@xmath3 flux of @xmath0  crb s companion to @xmath0  crb , at the @xmath41 and @xmath42 confidence levels , respectively .",
    "\\2 ) using baraffe et al.s ( 1998 , 2003 ) calculations of the @xmath4-band mass - luminosity relation , these flux limits correspond to mass upper bounds of 0.11 and 0.15@xmath2 at the 90 and 99% confidence limits , respectively .",
    "\\3 ) our analysis of the model binaries tested the sensitivity of our technique when using multiple orders .",
    "the results indicate that binaries with 1.6@xmath3 flux ratios as low as 0.01 to 0.02 are detectable by high spectral resolution ir spectroscopy .",
