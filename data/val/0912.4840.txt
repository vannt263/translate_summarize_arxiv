    "recent experiments@xcite on electronic mach - zehnder interferometers ( mzis ) constructed from integer quantum hall edge states have attracted a great deal of attention . in these experiments",
    "aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillations are observed in the differential conductance of the interferometer .",
    "the most striking results concern behaviour at finite bias voltage .",
    "the visibility of ab oscillations shows a series of lobes as a function of voltage , while their phase is independent of bias , except near visibility minima where it changes sharply by @xmath1 .",
    "our concern in this paper is with the theoretical understanding of these experiments .",
    "the observations are interesting from several perspectives .",
    "first , as was quickly appreciated,@xcite it is plausible that the effects arise from electron - electron interactions , because behaviour of this kind does not occur in a single particle model .",
    "in addition , more seems to be required than a simple treatment in which inelastic scattering leads only to decoherence , since approaches of that kind can not produce multiple side lobes in visibility of ab oscillations with increasing bias .",
    "it is remarkable that electron interactions should have the distinctive signatures found in this system , since integer quantum hall edge states are usually modelled in the low energy limit as a chiral fermi gas of independent particles.@xcite the experiments therefore appear to reflect interaction physics that is not captured by the standard , universal description , but is robust enough to appear in many devices of varying designs .",
    "a second reason for interest stems from current efforts@xcite to study interferometry in fractional quantum hall states as a probe of fractional or non - abelian quasiparticle statistics . against that background",
    "it is clearly important to understand unexpected interaction effects in much simpler , integer quantum hall systems .",
    "a third reason for interest is that the phenomenon seems to be an example of coherent many - body physics in a quantum system far from equilibrium .",
    "it invites comparison with other non - equilibrium quantum problems , from the kondo effect@xcite to cold atomic gases.@xcite    the design of an experimental device working as an mzi is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_machzender_exp ] .",
    "it uses the edge states of a two - dimensional electron gas that is in an integer quantum hall plateau .",
    "( most experiments have been done at filling factor @xmath2 , but broadly similar results have also been reported at @xmath3 ) .",
    "the edge states serve as electron waveguides and are coupled at quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) , which act as beam splitters .",
    "current between , for example , source s1 and drain d2 is measured as a function of the voltage difference applied between sources s1 and s2 .",
    "interference fringes are observed as oscillations in the differential conductance , either when the magnetic flux density is varied by a small amount , or when a side gate is used to change the interferometer area or arm lengths .",
    "the visibility and phase of these oscillations vary with voltage in the fashion already summarised .",
    "a physical scale is set by the bias voltage at which the first minimum in visibility occurs : the measured value , about 14@xmath4v in the first experiment,@xcite corresponds roughly to the chemical potential increase required to add one electron to an edge state with length equal to that of the interferometer arms : for arm length @xmath5 and edge velocity @xmath6 , this chemical potential increase is @xmath7 .",
    "theoretical studies of coherence in electronic mzis started before these experiments .",
    "early work treated dephasing arising from a variety of possible sources : interactions within the interferometer ; @xcite a fluctuating classical field;@xcite voltage probes;@xcite or coupling to an external quantum bath.@xcite none of these approaches generates the subsequently observed lobe pattern in the dependence of visibility on bias voltage .",
    "a further calculation,@xcite based on a microscopic treatment of the effects of long - range interactions and using bosonization combined with a perturbative treatment of tunneling at the qpcs , shows that non - monotonic variations in visibility can appear for weakly coupled edge states , but without capturing the features found experimentally .",
    "by contrast , studies of models with additional structure , involving either a counter - propagating edge mode@xcite or the pair of edge modes that arise at filling factor @xmath2,@xcite show that resonances can appear in that setting , which lead to lobes in visibility similar to those observed .",
    "these results are encouraging , but ( as we discuss in section [ sec : conclusion ] ) the models involved seem to us insufficiently generic to account for all experiments .",
    "more recently , approximate treatments of the effects of interactions at @xmath3 when edges are strongly coupled by qpcs have generated some of the behaviour found experimentally.@xcite there is good reason to think that these calculations identify some of the relevant physics , but the approximations used are non - standard and their domain of validity is unclear .    in this paper",
    "we set out a detailed treatment of interaction effects in mzis at filling factor @xmath8 .",
    "the approach is microscopic in the sense that it is based on the standard hamiltonian for quantum hall edge states,@xcite and does not involve external noise .",
    "our main results come from the exact solution of models which have one simplifying feature : interactions that are restricted to the interior of the mzi ; a short account of this part of our work has been presented previously.@xcite we also present work in three further directions .",
    "one of these is an elementary solution of the two - particle problem , which is a simplification of ideas from ref .  .",
    "we believe that this calculation provides a useful illustration of the essential physics behind the phenomena we are concerned with , which is multiparticle interference .",
    "a second direction is a careful analysis of the approximations involved in ref .  .",
    "the third direction is the formulation of perturbation theory in interaction strength , which allows us to assess the importance of interactions that extend beyond the interior of the mzi .",
    "the organisation of rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "the two - particle problem is addressed in section [ sec : toy - model ] , and the general microscopic description of the mzi is set out in section [ sec : model ] . in section [ sec : exact - solution ] we show how models with interactions only in the interior of the interferometer can be solved exactly . in secton [ sec : application_potentials ] we use this approach to study interferometers with various interaction potentials .",
    "we present a extended discussion of ref .   in section [ sec : discussion_neder ] , and develop perturbation theory in interaction strength in section [ sec : pert - theory ] .",
    "we summarise our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "some technical details of the calculations are given in appendices .",
    "in this section we set out a pedagogical treatment of the two - particle problem that illustrates how electron interactions affect the visibility of ab oscillations in an mzi .",
    "we consider an interferometer having both arms of the same length @xmath5 and a propagation velocity @xmath6 for electrons .",
    "denoting their separation by @xmath9 , the flight time during which both are inside the interferometer is @xmath10 .",
    "we take the two electrons to interact with a potential energy @xmath11 when both are inside the mzi on the same edge , but not to interact otherwise . for simplicity , we consider first the case in which the magnitudes of the transmission amplitudes at the two qpcs are @xmath12 , giving results for the general case later    we solve the scattering problem for an initial state in which both particles are positioned on the upper channel before the first contact .",
    "we evaluate the probability for one or both particles to exit the interferometer in the lower channel by summing all quantum mechanical amplitudes that connect the initial state to a given final state .",
    "we regard the expectation value for the total charge transferred from the upper channel to the lower channel as the analogue for the two - particle problem of the current in the many - body , steady state case .    to establish some notation , consider in the first instance single particle scattering , initially for one qpc and then for an mzi .",
    "amplitudes for the four scattering processes at one qpc are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_scatt_amp ] , and the two possible paths through an mzi between an initial state in the upper channel and a final state in the lower channel are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_one_part_paths ] .",
    "the amplitudes associated with these two paths are given by products of the amplitudes arising at each qpc .",
    "taking the total current to be proportional to the transition probability between the upper and lower channels , one obtains the standard result given in the caption to fig .",
    "[ fig_one_part_paths ] , with oscillations in the current as a function of the ab phase @xmath13 .",
    "now consider the two - particle problem with an initial state as described , in which both particles are on the upper channel .",
    "paths to a final state with both particles in the lower channel are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_two_part_paths_1 ] and those to a final state with one particle in each channel in fig .",
    "[ fig_two_part_paths_2 ] .",
    "( because there is no dispersion , particles can not exchange positions in the scattering process .",
    "they may therefore be treated as if they were distinguishable , and this is reflected in the figures by the use of different colours for the paths of each particle . ) without interactions the amplitude for a given pair of paths would simply be a product of contributions for each particle .",
    "interactions contribute additional phase factors @xmath14 when both particles propagate on the same channel inside the interferometer .",
    "the average charge transferred between the upper and lower channels in the scattering process is @xmath15 where both terms are multiplied by factors of two , since @xmath16 describes two - particle transmission , while single - particle transmission with amplitude @xmath17 can occur for either particle .",
    "ab oscillations are represented in this expression by the term in @xmath18 .",
    "their strength is modulated by the factor @xmath19 .",
    "we can take the interaction strength @xmath11 to play the same role in the two - particle problem as bias voltage in the many - body system , since increasing bias leads to reduced spatial separation between electrons entering the mzi above a filled fermi sea , which in turn increases the interaction energy between these electrons .",
    "the phenomenon can be summarised by defining the visibility of ab oscillations .",
    "let @xmath20 and @xmath21 be the maximum and minimum values of @xmath22 as @xmath13 varies .",
    "the visibility is @xmath23 from eq .",
    "( [ current_2part ] ) we have @xmath24 , and hence a lobe pattern in @xmath25 as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "it is also evident from eq .",
    "( [ current_2part ] ) that the phase of ab oscillations changes abruptly by @xmath1 at zeros of @xmath25 .",
    "we use the same approach to calculate the current for the case of arbitrary tunneling amplitudes @xmath26 at the qpcs .",

    "in other respects , however , the two - body problem is illuminating .",
    "in particular , while the behaviour of @xmath25 is not affected by the value of @xmath33 except for a multiplicative factor , if @xmath34 the zeros of the visibility turn into finite minima and the jumps in the phase of ab oscillations become smooth rises . in the limit that transmission at the first qpq approaches @xmath35 or @xmath36 , modulations of @xmath25 with @xmath11 disappear altogether .",
    "these features are also present in the many body problem .",
    "one consequence is that the lobe pattern can not be obtained at leading order from a calculation that is perturbative in tunneling .",
    "our model for the mzi is sketched in fig .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath37 it has three contributions : @xmath38 is the single particle term for an isolated edge ; @xmath39 represents electron - electron interactions ; and @xmath40 describes tunneling at the qpcs labelled @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we consider initially edge channels of length @xmath43 with periodic boundary conditions , then take @xmath44",
    ". allowed wavevectors are @xmath45 , with @xmath46 integer .",
    "fermionic operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which create and annihilate an electron with momentum @xmath49 on the edge @xmath50 , obey standard anticommutation relations @xmath51 . in coordinate representation",

    "the ab phase due to enclosed flux is @xmath64 .",
    "this model can be solved exactly when interactions occur only between pairs of electrons that are both inside the interferometer , in the region denoted ii in fig .",
    "we present results in section [ sec : application_potentials ] calculated using three different choices for such internal interactions .",
    "the first of these is simply a charging energy @xmath65 an interaction of this kind is standard in the theory of quantum dots and for an mzi was treated approximately in ref .  .",
    "to test the robustness of behaviour to changes in the form of interaction , we also obtain results for two types of interaction potential that vary with electron separation inside the interferometer , taking @xmath66 and either an exponential dependence @xmath67 or a coulomb form @xmath68",
    "in this section we give a full account of the solution outlined previously in ref .  .",
    "we study the interferometer at finite bias voltage by computing the quantum - mechanical time evolution of an initial state in which the single - particle levels of @xmath38 for the two edges are occupied up to different chemical potentials , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the interferometer reaches a steady state at long times , and we evaluate observables in this state .",
    "the challenge of the calculation comes from the difficulty of treating both tunneling and interactions non - perturbatively .",
    "each part of the problem can be described by a quadratic hamiltonian , but the appropriate variables are different in the two cases : fermionic for tunneling , and bosonic for interactions . a model which has only internal interactions can be solved exactly because in these circumstances the effects of tunneling at qpcs and of interactions can be handled separately . in the following we consider only edge states at filling factor @xmath3 and an initial state at zero temperature , but both these restrictions",
    "could be lifted within the approach .    to treat time evolution we use the interaction representation , taking as the free part of the hamiltonian @xmath71 and as the ` interaction ' part @xmath72 . in this representation",
    "the time evolution of the fermion operators is given by @xmath73 the wavefunction of the system , which we denote at @xmath74 by @xmath75 , evolves with the s - matrix @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes time - ordering .",
    "we distinguish operators in the schrdinger and interaction representations by the absence or presence of a time argument . in section [ sub : exact_cur_der ]",
    "we also use operators in the heisenberg representation , and we indicate these with a subscript @xmath78 .    the presentation of the remainder of the calculation is organised as follows .",
    "the observable we are concerned with is the current through the mzi , and we derive a convenient form for the corresponding operator in section [ sub : exact_cur_der ] .",

    "one of these@xcite involves a plasmon resonance between one arm of the mzi and a counter - propagating edge state at the boundary of the hall bar .",
    "such a coupling of the mzi to another edge state is not an essential part of the interferometer design , and in this sense the mechanism is not an intrinsic one .",
    "for that reason , it seems unlikely to provide the explanation for observations in many different samples of varying designs .",
    "the most important comparison is therefore between a second category of explanation,@xcite which is based on coupling between the two channels existing at each edge for filling factor @xmath434 , and the third category , which is formed by the calculations that we have presented , together with earlier approximate discussions @xcite of similar physics , and has been worked out for a system at @xmath0 .",

    "some important discrepancies between this theory and experiment remain , however .",
    "one is that , within the approach of ref .  , the shape of the envelope of the lobe pattern is controlled by the difference in interferometer arm lengths : in particular , for an interferometer with arms of equal length , visibility does not fall to zero at large bias .",
    "this is in conflict with observations .",
    "it requires one to assume@xcite that two separate physical processes are involved : the process included in the theory , which leads to multiple zeros in visibility at @xmath434 , and another one , omitted from the theory ( such as dispersion of the edge modes ) , which controls decay of the envelope .",
    "moreover , if this theory is adopted at @xmath434 , the existence of a single side lobe at @xmath0 must be attributed to a separate dephasing mechanism , following eq .",
    "( [ dephasing ] ) . in experiment",
    ", there appears to be a common voltage scale determining all aspects : the zeros in visibility at @xmath434 , the envelope of the lobe pattern at either filling factor , and the position of the visibility zero at @xmath0 .",
    "it would be a surprising coincidence if two separate mechanisms were both to involve the same scale .",
    "an explanation of multiple side lobes in visibility based exclusively on dispersionless slow and fast edge modes at @xmath434 therefore seems problematic .",
    "by contrast , the calculations we have presented generate zeros of visibility and an overall decaying envelope for visibility from a single mechanism . depending on interaction strength we find either multiple side lobes or only a single prominent side lobe .",
    "the mechanism is essentially plasmon dispersion .",
    "it is likely that a full understanding of experiments will require a combination of both aspects  dispersion and the existence of two modes at @xmath434 .",
    "it is however , an important point of principle , demonstrated by the calculations we have described , that multiple side lobes are not an exclusive consequence of coupling between a slow and a fast mode at @xmath434 .",
    "a definite qualitative feature of our results is that exact zeros of fringe visibility at certain values of bias voltage appear only for an interferometer with equal length arms , in which the transmission probability at the first qpc is tuned precisely to the value one half .",
    "changes in transmission probability and ( though to a much lesser extent , if interactions are strong ) arm length from these values convert exact zeros to finite minima in visibility .",
    "such sensitivity to transmission probability has not been reported experimentally .",
    "the reason it appears in our theory can be understood starting from eq .",
    "( [ dephasing ] ) : exact zeros of visibility can occur only if the phase @xmath433 of ab oscillations is independent of bias @xmath421 .",
    "a phase independent of bias is ensured by symmetry for an interferometer with @xmath435 and @xmath312 .",
    "for other parameter choices , our model , in which there are no interactions between electrons on opposite interferometer arms , yields a bias - dependent @xmath433 , essentially because that hartree potentials for electrons on each arm vary differently with @xmath421 . for this reason",
    ", it would be interesting to generalise our treatment to systems with interactions between edges as well as within each edge .",
    "we expect that such interactions would reduce or eliminate the dependence of @xmath433 on @xmath421 , giving near or exact zeros of visibility even for @xmath436 or @xmath437 , in accord with experiment .",
    "other possible generalisations include calculation of finite temperature effects and of noise power .",
