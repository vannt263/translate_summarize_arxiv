    "ever since its proposal as a way to generate neutrino masses , either on its own or in the context of effective seesaw schemes  @xcite , many variants of the triplet model have been considered .",

    "they are also a characteristic feature in several left - right symmetric models @xcite , required in order to reduce the extended gauge structure down to the minimal 1 . for studies of the phenomenology of left - right symmetric models , both supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric",

    "recent experiments , including the recently published first results of kamland @xcite , have confirmed the lma - msw oscillation solution to the solar neutrino problem  @xcite .",
    "together with the earlier discoveries in atmospheric neutrinos @xcite , one can now be fairly confident that all neutrino flavours mix and that at least two non - zero neutrino masses exist .",
    "this impressive progress has brought the quest for an understanding of the smallness of neutrino masses to the center of attention in particle physics .    in the standard model neutrinos",
    "are massless .",
    "one of the best - known mechanisms to generate small ( majorana ) neutrino masses is the seesaw mechanism .",
    "elegant as it may be , the seesaw mechanism is not the only theoretically interesting approach to neutrino masses .",
    "more interesting from a phenomenological point of view are models in which the neutrino masses are generated at the electroweak scale .",
    "models of this kind include , for example , variants of the seesaw scheme at the electro - weak scale  @xcite , radiative models of neutrino mass  @xcite and supersymmetry with r - parity violation  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we further explore the triplet approach to neutrino mass , by combining it with the idea of bilinear r - parity violating ( brpv ) supersymmetry .",
    "the later might arise as the effective description of models with spontaneously broken r - parity  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the required smallness of the bilinear r parity violating parameters may result from some suitable family symmetry  @xcite , thus providing a common solution @xcite to the so - called mu - problem  @xcite and the neutrino anomalies .    at",
    "the superpotential level lepton number violation resides only in the explicit brpv terms , but after electro - weak symmetry breaking takes place , this induces a naturally small vev for the neutral component of the higgs triplets , suppressed by two powers of the brpv parameters  @xcite , as emphasized recently by ernest ma  @xcite  ) and eq .",
    "( [ mbeff ] ) below . ] .",
    "the result is a hybrid scheme for the neutrino masses .",
    "an attractive and natural possibility is that the atmospheric mass scale arises from bilinear r - parity breaking , while the solar mass scale is generated by the small higgs triplet vevs .",
    "the model is theoretically simple , since only tree - level physics is required to explain current neutrino data , and has the advantage of being directly testable in the next generation of colliders .",
    "the presence of higgs triplets would induce lepton flavor violating decays of muons and taus .",
    "a number of low - energy constraints on higgs triplet couplings have been derived from the non - observation of such processes  @xcite .",
    "although the model we are considering is different from the standard left - right models , many constraints apply equally well to our case .",
    "the most important bounds for our model are from the experimental upper limits on @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which can be expressed as @xcite ,    @xmath6    from @xmath7 and @xmath8 from @xmath9 . here , @xmath10 are the yukawa couplings of the triplet to the leptons and @xmath11 is the triplet mass .",
    "note that these bounds are on products of two couplings .",
    "limits exist @xcite on individual yukawa couplings but are weaker by several orders of magnitude .",

    "the model to be presented below is the supersymmetric extension of the original triplet model of neutrino mass  @xcite in which the simplest form of r - parity violation is assumed .",
    "the model is defined by the particle content of the minimal supersymmetric extension of standard model ( mssm ) augmented by a pair of higgs triplet superfields : @xmath12 with hypercharges @xmath13 and @xmath14 and lepton number @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "note that although only one higgs triplet superfield is necessary to provide the neutrinos with appropriate masses , two triplets are needed to avoid the triangle gauge anomaly .",
    "apart from the new higgs triplet superfields , we include r - parity violation in three generations , by adding bilinear lepton number violating superpotential terms  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
