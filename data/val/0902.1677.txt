    "neutrons and nuclei , though very similar with respect to the microscopic description of weak interaction , offer very different aspects of it which are addressed by the experiments .",
    "these in turn are sensitive also to more macroscopic effects ( strong interaction - qcd , effects of composite systems ) .",
    "the simplicity of the free neutron offers a rather clear interpretation of results without much of the theoretical corrections as exhibited by composite systems .",
    "the characteristics are : small radiative corrections , small influence of isospin breaking effects , no schiff moments influencing the search for an electric dipole moment ( edm ) , but difficulties in handling purely electrically neutral systems .",
    "nuclei in turn offer : flexible mixture of fermi- and gamow - teller transitions , high statistics , application of cold atom techniques , high precision mass measurements , well focusable systems , requiring only small trapping volumes ( easier magnetic shielding for edm experiments ) , but sensitivity to nuclear matrix elements and ambiguous interpretation for edm experiments .    in the course of this article we will outline the strength of each system using particular examples , thereby focussing on new results and planned experiments .",

    "this offers sensitivity to different interaction types like scalar ( s ) , pseudo - scalar ( p ) , vector ( v ) , axial vector ( a ) or tensor ( t ) and can be studied in neutron or nuclear @xmath0-decay .",
    "the standard model assumes pure v - a structure motivated by experiments and upper limits on scalar or tensor interaction are presently at a level of @xcite : @xmath8 the decay parameters besides of being pure numbers also relate to the underlying discrete symmetries obeyed or violated in the decay . in the latter case",
