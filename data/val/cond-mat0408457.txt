    "at low temperatures , many metals undergo a transition into a state with a gap in the single - electron excitation spectrum and become either superconductors or insulators with a periodic modulation of the electron charge or spin density .",
    "the insulating and superconducting ( sc ) orders inhibit each other by reducing the fraction of the fermi surface available for the gap of the competing phase .",
    "the balance between the two phases is very sensitive to the fermi surface shape and can be changed by , e.g. , pressure , doping or magnetic field .",
    "nonetheless , in a surprisingly large number of materials the sc and insulating states coexist.@xcite this paper is focused on the coexistence of superconducting and charge density wave ( cdw ) states , observed in , e.g. , layered transition metal dichalcogenides @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 and @xmath0-tas@xmath1,@xcite the quasi - one - dimensional compound nbse@xmath2,@xcite tungsten bronzes a@xmath3wo@xmath2,@xcite and quarter - filled organic materials.@xcite one of the best studied and best characterized cdw superconductors is the transition metal dichalcogenide @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 . at @xmath4 k this compound undergoes a second - order phase transition to an incommensurate cdw state,@xcite which is likely driven by the nesting of a part of the fermi surface.@xcite the resistivity , however , remains metallic - like down to @xmath5 k , at which this material becomes superconducting,@xcite and the superconductivity coexists with the cdw modulations.@xcite the coupling between the cdw and sc order parameters , resulting from the competition between these two states , was observed in a number of experiments .",
    "thus , the suppression of the charge density modulation by pressure and hydrogen intercalation results in an increase of @xmath6.@xcite a similar interplay between the cdw and sc states upon applied pressure and doping is observed in nbse@xmath2 and tungsten bronzes.@xcite    in this paper we adopt a rather general , though simplified , viewpoint on the interplay between the sc and cdw states .",
    "we assume that it originates from the competition between two different fermi surface instabilities : the instability towards the electron pairing , which gives rise to superconductivity , and the instability towards the electron - hole ( or excitonic ) pairing . here , we focus primarily on the effects of quenched disorder on this competition .",
    "we show that even in ` the worst case scenario ' , when the two states compete over the whole fermi surface and therefore , in absence of disorder , are mutually exclusive , disorder stabilizes a _ uniform _ state , in which superconducting and insulating order parameters coexist . while having no effect on the superconducting phase , nonmagnetic disorder tends to close the cdw gap before completely suppressing the corresponding order parameter .",
    "disorder induces low - energy states by breaking some of the electron - hole pairs .",
    "the released electrons and holes can subsequently form cooper pairs , resulting in the coexistence of the two phases .    while in usual @xmath7-wave superconductors , non - magnetic impurities have little effect on the transition temperature,@xcite experiments on electron irradiated",
    "transition metal dichalcogenides have shown strong dependence of @xmath6 on the concentration of defects.@xcite this was attributed to the interplay between the sc and cdw orderings : similarly to effect of pressure,@xcite disorder strongly suppresses the cdw state , which results in the observed increase of the sc critical temperature .",
    "theoretically , the combined effect of the cdw modulation and disorder on the pairing instability have been studied in ref .  [ ] , where an increase of @xmath6 was found . however , in that paper the amplitude of the cdw modulation was assumed to be fixed , which is clearly insufficient in view of the strong suppression of the cdw state by disorder . in this paper",

    "@xcite the interplay between the cdw and sc states in this and other materials requires further experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "crucially , one may note that the phase diagram of the interacting system was inferred from the self - consistent hartree - fock approximation which captures only the mean - field characteristics .",
    "in view of the filamentary structure of the coexistence region , the system can be susceptible to mesoscopic or sample to sample fluctuations due to the quenched impurity potential .",
    "such effects are recorded in fluctuations of the field @xmath62 around its saddle - point or mean - field value ( as opposed to the leading terms gathered in the low - order @xmath18 expansion considered here ) . in the gapless regime , such effects can give rise to long - ranged diffusion mode contributions to the generalized pair susceptibility ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , ref .",
    ". however , in the present case , the disorder potential imposes a symmetry breaking perturbation on the ei phase . as such",
    ", we can expect mesoscopic fluctuations due to disorder to impose only a short - ranged ( i.e. local on the scale of the coherence length of the ei order parameter ) perturbation on the pair susceptibility . in the vicinity of the coexistence region , where the potential for the angle @xmath154 is shallow",
    ", the effect of these mesoscopic fluctuations may be significant .",
    "to understand the effect of random fluctuations in the coexistence region , we consider the ginzburg - landau expansion for the ground state energy close to the quantum critical point @xmath192 , at which the ei and sc states are degenerate . in the vicinity of this point",
    "the phase @xmath154 of the ` total ' order parameter @xmath193 is a soft mode , so that weak disorder mainly induces spatial fluctuations of the phase , while the magnitude of the order parameter @xmath194 approximately stays constant . as in the derivation of eq.([eq : enexp2 ] ) , we expand the energy in powers of @xmath194 and disorder strength , assuming that @xmath195 , which is justified in the coexistence region , where @xmath196 ( see eq.([eq : ga1ga2 ] ) . assuming that the phase varies slowly on the length scale of the correlation length @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the fermi velocity , we obtain @xmath199\\ ;    , \\ ] ] where the first term describes the ` elastic energy ' of an inhomogeneous state , the disorder - averaged free energy @xmath200 is given by eq.([eq : enexp2 ] ) , and @xmath201 is the fluctuating part of disorder coupled to the phase of the order parameter . neglecting correlations on a scale smaller that the correlation length , @xmath201 can be approximately considered as a random @xmath159-correlated gaussian variable with zero average , @xmath202 , and variance @xmath203 ( we omit the lengthy calculations that lead to this result ) .",
    "the coupling to disorder also occurs in higher orders of the expansion , but those terms are relatively small and can be neglected .    following the imry and ma argument,@xcite we consider a large phase fluctuation , e.g. , a droplet of the sc phase of the spatial extent @xmath204 inside the ei matrix . comparing the typical energy gain due to the coupling to disorder @xmath205 with the loss in the elastic energy @xmath206 , we find that the fluctuation is energetically favorable for @xmath207 where we took into account that , in the coexistence region , @xmath208",
    ".    the crucial difference of our model from that considered in ref .",
    "[ ] is the absence of an exact continuous symmetry .",
    "even in the coexistence region , the minimal - energy valley connecting the sc and ei points ( @xmath179 and @xmath209 ) is not perfectly flat .",
    "the typical amplitude of the variations of the energy density is @xmath210 ( see eq .  ) , resulting in the energy loss @xmath211 proportional the volume of the fluctuation , which suppresses large droplets . comparing it with the energy gain , we find @xmath212 equations ( [ eq : l1 ] ) and ( [ eq : l2 ] ) hold simultaneously for @xmath213 which can not be satisfied in the weak coupling limit .",
    "one may wonder why the condition ( [ eq : condition ] ) does not hold even for @xmath214 , where the model has a continuous symmetry .",
    "the reason is that in our model the role of disorder is two - fold . on the one hand , it couples to the order parameter , as in the ` random field ' model discussed in ref .",
    "[ ] and tends to destroy the ordering .",
    "on the other hand , it affects the energy difference between the ei and sc states and , therefore , suppresses the phase fluctuations , by destroying the symmetry of the energy potential . the second effect , which is linear in @xmath18 , is stronger than the first .",
    "thus , the inhomogeneity of the order parameter , resulting from typical disorder fluctuations is small .",
    "the phase fluctuations can also be induced by large disorder fluctuations ( lifshitz tails ) , but their contribution to the free energy is exponentially small.@xcite this justifies our mean field treatment of disorder .",
    "this conclusion may not hold , however , for strongly coupled cdw superconductors or for other types of disorder .",
    "qualitatively , we expect that inhomogeneous excitonic and superconducting order parameters may result in a broadening of the coexistence region",
    ". the local suppression of the excitonic pairing near charged impurities can give rise to the local enhancement of the superconducting order .",
    "the state with such a nanoscale phase separation , in which two competing orders alternate in antiphase without a loss of the macroscopic coherence , can be more energetically favorable than the uniform state and , therefore , can be stabilized in a wider interval of parameters . such a state",
    "was observed in @xmath215sr experiments on doped cugeo@xmath2 , which shows both spin - peierls and antiferromagnetic ordering.@xcite    in conclusion , we studied effects of disorder on systems with competing superconducting and charge - density - wave instabilities .",
    "we showed that even in the extreme situation , when the competition takes place over the whole fermi surface and the superconducting and charge - density - wave phases are mutually exclusive , disorder can give rise to their coexistence in a spatially homogeneous state .",
    "furthermore , disorder itself can be used as a parameter , with which one can tune the balance between competing phases .",
    "although our model is too simple to describe the physics behind the coexistence of superconductivity and cdw(sdw ) states in , e.g. , high-@xmath6 or heavy fermion materials , we believe that the ability of disorder to bring together incompatible phases may be important for understanding phase diagrams of these systems .",
    "in this appendix we obtain a condition under which both the sc and ei instabilities can occur simultaneously . here , we consider more realistic interactions between electrons than those described by the model  , namely , the phonon - mediated interaction and the coulomb repulsion . the coulomb repulsion counteracts the phonon - mediated attraction between electrons and suppresses the sc instability .",
    "the same holds for the instability towards the formation of the excitonic condensate with the difference that the two types of interaction now change roles : the coulomb force favors the electron - hole pairing , while the one - phonon exchange results in a repulsion between electrons and holes .",
    "we will show that the sc and ei instabilities can coexist due to different frequency dependence of the two types of interactions .    for retarded phonon - mediated interactions , the order parameters @xmath66 and @xmath38",
    "are frequency - dependent , which complicates the solution of the self - consistency equations .",
