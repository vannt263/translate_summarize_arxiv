    "the propagation of flames through premixed gaseous reactants is governed by basic physical phenomena ( subsonic and variable - density fluid mechanics , heat / mass transports , chemistry ) that are now well understood individually @xcite .",
    "also , modern computers allow their simultaneous handling in a wealth of situations @xcite ... if the flames are not of too large overall extent , @xmath0 , or coupled with other phenomena ( pressure waves , incoming eddies , radiant exchanges , ... ) .",
    "this might suggest that the field is under control , but it s actually not quite so even for practical purposes , not to mention the theoretical aspects .",
    "direct numerical simulations must indeed solve the governing equations outside _ and _ inside wandering flames of thickness @xmath1 , often a quite demanding task : the conduction - convection length @xmath2 based upon the fresh - gas heat diffusivity @xmath3 , an overall chemical time @xmath4 and the flame speed @xmath5 of a flat ( or nearly so ) flame , usually is in the @xmath6  m range for gaseous combustion at atmospheric ambient pressure @xmath7 whereas @xmath0 typically is from a few @xmath8  m to a fraction for laboratory or industrial burners ; @xmath9 reaches several @xmath10 in high - pressure combustion and hazardous explosions @xcite , rising to over @xmath11 for thermonuclear ` flames ' in ia - supernov  @xcite .",
    "up to @xmath12 factors ( prandtl and lewis numbers ) , @xmath13 also measures the range of counter - streamwise diffusions of momentum and species in gases .",
    "furthermore , chemistry takes place in an even thinner internal layer of @xmath14 thickness , where the zeldovich number of the overall reaction , @xmath15 , is an activation - to - maximum temperature ratio .",
    "a way out of the difficulties in many such situations is to idealise flames as hydrodynamic discontinuities ",
    "fronts  separating chemically inert and inviscid fresh or burned media of markedly different densities , and equipped with a propagation law to fix the local burning speed and with hugoniot jumps , both amended by analytically derived corrections resulting from a finite @xmath13 ; the needed studies of local flame structure are now essentially complete ( see @xcite ) .",
    "anyway , the number of nodes involved in numerical @xmath16-dimensional simulations of an interface embedded in the now chemistry - free flows still scales like @xmath17 , @xmath16 = 2 or 3 , which often is the limiting step of simulations since @xmath0 exceeds @xmath13 by far in most situations . restricting attention to the propagating front  the entity of primary interest  would decrease the number of nodes down to @xmath18 and that of unknowns to 1 , but would require to theoretically derive an equation for the flame front itself , which has thus far not been fully completed .",
    "the difficulties that have been precluding a full theoretical treatment of flame front dynamics since the 1940s have three main origins : _ geometry(ies ) , nonlocal interactions and vorticity_. determining the moving front shape indeed constitutes a free - boundary problem , which is enough to bring about nonlinearities of geometrical origin even with linear field equations ; the matter is further complicated by the often involved geometry of the domain where the front evolves ( combustion chamber , obstacles ,  ) , especially in view of the difficulty to be evoked next that survives even when the combustion processes proper have a short range @xmath1 .",
    "being markedly subsonic phenomena , premixed flames can not be described by a mere partial differential equation for their front , since low - mach - number hydrodynamics combined with piecewise - uniform ( but different ) densities implies that all the fluid elements are coupled to the front motions instantaneously ; the converse coupling can not be neglected either , because a flame propagates relative to the fresh flow : the front evolution equation is also integral in space , at least . as to vorticity , in general one can not solve the fluid - mechanical equations for vortical flows even when piecewise incompressible and effectively inviscid ( @xmath19 implies a large reynolds number ) , whereas combustion invariably generates vorticity @xcite ; the task is not at all eased when an unsteady ` internal boundary '  the front ",
    "is wandering somewhere in the middle .    to wit ,",
    "the early works ( 38 and 44 ) of darrieus @xcite and landau @xcite ( dl ) on the basic hydrodynamic flame instability , then on its ultra - violet cut - off by local curvature effects @xcite , had to consider nearly flat fronts , for only then could one solve the linearised burnt - gas hydrodynamics and find the growth rate pertaining to a prescribed wave - number of wrinkling .",
    "the need to stay close to simple shapes also was felt when better accounting for the local physico - chemical flame properties @xcite , or when studying the stability of near - spherical expanding fronts @xcite .",
    "it was also implicit in sivashinsky s treatment @xcite of saturation of the ( then weak- ) dl instability by weak nonlinearities in the limit of small density changes , and in extensions thereof @xcite : all addressed nearly - flat , or -cylindrical , -spherical , fronts .    until recently the sole exception to the simple - shape & weakly - nonlinear constraint , allowing for large front wrinkles while retaining nonlocal aspects of front - to - front interactions , was the equation proposed by frankel @xcite as a potential - flow extrapolation of sivashinsky s to arbitrary amplitudes of wrinkling .",
    "the latter equation , originally obtained @xcite from a flow that happens to be potential to leading order for small density changes , turned out to also govern the shape of steady flat - on - average wrinkled flames when the next order ( hence some vorticity effects ) is retained @xcite ; retaining up to three more orders for steady fronts @xcite leads to a generalisation known as the zhdanov - trubnikov equation @xcite with similar properties ... , just like potential flow models do @xcite .",
    "as shown later on here , integral formulations _ via _",
    "frankel - like equations show good prospects to handle the complicated geometries of the flame front along with the influence of the boundaries and the nonlocal interactions ; it may ultimately prove to constitute a mostly convenient way of handling thin flames even when vorticity is accounted for : as a perturbation like in @xcite or , better , on properly adapting the non - perturbative methods of @xcite ( yet to be done ) .",
    "recent advances indeed made it possible to relax the restriction to weakly nonlinear shapes while still retaining vorticity ( @xcite , and references therein ) , in simple large - scale configurations : two - dimensional spatially @xmath20-periodic flow - field and front , flat - on - transverse - average flame , smooth spontaneous growth of disturbances since the remote past , piecewise - incompressible fluids .",
    "it was shown that the task of solving the euler equations can then be bypassed when only the flame - front evolution is sought , which resulted in closed equations for the front shape and potential velocity components defined _ along _ it ( as opposed to in the bulk ) whatever the front wrinkle amplitudes and the expansion ratio .",
    "such equations are necessarily nonlocal in space ( to account for the nonlocal potential interactions like in frankel s ) _ and _ in time ( to keep track of the flame history , stored space - wise as a vorticity field ) , except when the burnt gas flow is quasi - steady ; also , these equations are not yet fully ripe for numerical treatments , especially for unsteady fronts , and are still restricted to such simple boundaries as straight channels . except in rare no - boundary situations ( e.g. , unconfined expanding flames ) , laboratory measurements or specific appliances",
    "do involve more complicated boundaries ( and conditions along them ) , whose part precisely is to affect the flame behaviours in a ( hopefully- ) controlled way , e.g. , to keep them where required .",
    "how to incorporate such boundaries remained to be done , which _ a priori _ is a rather inconvenient constraint for comparisons with theories , since flames of infinite lateral extent are not easy to study experimentally .",
    "recall that the equation derived in @xcite for steady flames in straight channels ( or of infinite lateral extent ) takes the form of an integral equation for some potential velocity field with vorticity - affected jumps across the front ; these resulted from a delicate simplification of the solution ( stream - function ) to a poisson equation , so as to isolate its vorticity - containing downstream contributions near the front @xcite .",
    "the nonlocal equation derived by frankel for @xmath21 potential - flow models also results from a poisson problem for a ( complex - valued ) stream function , like the nonlocal equations in @xcite yet only with concentrated non - negative sources along the front , whereas actual flows also have a distributed source , vorticity , of zero transverse average . as such it has a family likeness with kazakov s equation ( i.e. , in steady cases ) @xcite and shares important ingredients with it ; most notably the green s function of laplace s equation that is long - ranged in 2d and",
    "hence constitutes a convenient vehicle to encode geometrical properties of boundaries : shape of channel walls and obstacles to keep fronts where needed , for example .    obtaining frankel - type equations for fronts in the presence of obstacles , taking up the numerical treatment / difficulties , and displaying the associated front properties",
    "may thus prove of interest _ per se _ , as a flame - like dynamical system able to cope with more realistic geometries ( e.g. , multiply - connected fluid domains ) than in @xcite while accounting for nonlocal self - interactions , _ and _ as a prerequisite for vorticity - containing formulations ; comparisons between the two will also help understand and quantify the specific influences of vorticity effects : insofar as spontaneous front evolutions ( or occurring on the same time scale if forced ) are concerned , the influence of vorticity indeed turned out to be only quantitative ( weaker - than - potential hydrodynamic instability , different constants in evolution equations  ) .",
    "potential - flow flame models with nontrivial geometry of boundaries are what the present contribution is about , in a few @xmath21 configurations accessible to complex - variable methods , conformal mappings in particular : the flexibility of such tools gives access to interesting domain shapes without affecting the neumann conditions at impenetrable walls or the laplace equation in the bulk ; also , green s functions trivially transform .",
    "nonlocal front self - interactions also are accounted for in a natural way .",
    "our ( admittedly restricted ) present scope thus only concerns two aspects _geometry(ies ) _ and space - wise _ nonlocal interactions _  of the complete , as yet unsolved , problem .",
    "we are fully aware that omitting vorticity can possibly miss some aspects of flame dynamics , and only qualitative agreement with actual fronts is expected in general , rendering quantitative comparisons with full - blown direct numerical simulations and experiments still premature ; there could be more than that on occasion , however , since vorticity and its conceivable consequences only little show up in some important instances ( see @xcite ) and are then likely amenable to perturbative treatments like in @xcite .",
    "moreover , given the structure of the vorticity - affected equation derived in @xcite , the tools and results of the present contribution will also be of interest to tackle the full problem .",

    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the regularised potential models and their general integral form are introduced in sec.2 .",
    "the selected method of numerical integration is presented in sec.3 , in the context of free flames confined by parallel channel walls .",
    "section 4 addresses channelled flames settled counter - streamwise about a round central obstacle ( fig.[fig1 ] ) in high - speed flows , the related case of front positioned near lateral bumps being examined next , in sec.5 .",
    "flames fed by oscillating fresh flows are taken up in sec.6 .",
    "the paper ends up with conclusions , perspectives and open problems ( sec.7 ) .",
    "a short appendix analyses slender flames .",
    "the flow is henceforth assumed two - dimensional , piecewise incompressible on each side of an infinitely thin flame - front .",
    "the internal time @xmath22 is considered negligible throughout .",
    "hence chemical , or transport - related , front / boundary interactions like wall ignition or anchoring @xcite are not addressed here .",
    "the flat - flame speed @xmath5 is assumed known from a separate analysis ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , as is the markstein length @xmath23 introduced in equation ( [ eq:6 ] ) below .",
    "density is taken as unity over the fresh gas side and @xmath24 in the burnt medium , whereby the velocity @xmath25 , with components @xmath26 in cartesian coordinates @xmath27 , fig.[fig1 ] , is solenoidal on either side : @xmath28 outside of the front , the no - vorticity assumption inherent to frankel types of models implies @xmath29 for some potential @xmath30 , whence @xmath30 itself is harmonic : @xmath31 even though potential flows can accomodate viscous effects at interfaces @xcite , the simplest jump relations compatible with a nonzero mass flux across the flame @xcite are adopted here : the tangential gradient @xmath32 of @xmath30 , and the potential @xmath30 itself are considered continuous at the front , whereas the normal velocity satisfies @xmath33 \\equiv \\boldsymbol{u}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n}|_+ - \\boldsymbol{u}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n}|_- = ( e-1)\\,u_0\\ , \\sigma(\\boldsymbol{x},t).\\ ] ] on account of mass conservation and density jump @xcite . here",
    "@xmath34 is the unit normal to the front pointing to the burnt side , and @xmath35 is time .",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ eq:3 ] ) measures the rate of volume production ( per unit front area ) associated with the density drop from 1 to @xmath36 .",
    "finally , the boundary conditions associated with ( [ eq:2 ] ) include @xmath37 along the @xmath38-th impermeable boundary with local normal @xmath39 . in channel geometries like in fig.[fig1 ] , @xmath25",
    "also is prescribed to be uniform and parallel to the @xmath40-axis , @xmath41 at @xmath42 ( incoming fresh - gas flow ) ; for free propagation and steady flames ( if any ) @xmath43 is a kind of eigenvalue to be found as part of the solution , whereas for flames near obstacles like in fig.[fig1 ] , @xmath44 is a prescribed , high - enough @xmath45 injection velocity .    given a ` charge - density ' @xmath46 , ( [ eq:1])-([eq:4 ] )",
    "are sufficient to compute @xmath47 pertaining to a presumed flame shape and , in particular , the fresh - gas velocity @xmath48 just ahead of its front . to determine the latter s evolution , its normal velocity @xmath49 is prescribed to satisfy : @xmath50 where the ( scaled- ) burning velocity @xmath51 may depend explicitly on @xmath52 .",
    "this could help one model @xmath12 variations in @xmath5 , without noticeable change in the densities , caused by @xmath53 fractional modifications in mixture composition ; or in models where @xmath54 would account for an effective local burning speed , determined by averaging over small(er)-scale wrinkles .",
    "like in frankel s original work @xcite we shall assume @xmath55 throughout the paper , even though the @xmath56 function will be kept in most formul , for completeness . to simplify the subsequent formul  we shall henceforth adopt units where @xmath57 .    with @xmath58 in ( [ eq:3])([eq:5 ] ) ,",
    "the problem is dynamically ill - posed , however , as is seen on considering a steady flat front @xmath59 located at @xmath40=@xmath60=const . and perturbed by infinitesimal wrinkles proportional to @xmath61 ; routine fourier analysis of the linearised ( [ eq:2])-([eq:5 ] ) yields @xmath62 for the wrinkle growth rate @xmath63 . because the above formulation is of first order in time and autonomous ( one",
    "may then everywhere omit @xmath35 as argument to save space ) , it has no inertia / memory effect and @xmath64 exceeds what the dl analyses gave , implying a _ stronger _ mechanism of spontaneous wrinkling : the dl growth rate @xmath65 satisfies @xmath66 . as expected on dimensional grounds ( only one way to get a left @xmath67 right invariant growth rate @xmath63 from a flat - flame velocity @xmath68 , a wave number @xmath69 , and two densities ) , both predict @xmath70 , with @xmath71 depending on @xmath72 only and vanishing at @xmath73 . at any rate , @xmath74 as @xmath75 when @xmath76 , thus rendering the dynamics ill - posed , and an expedient way to regularise the problem is to introduce a markstein cut - off length @xmath77 @xcite , replacing ( [ eq:5 ] ) by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the local front curvature .",
    "@xmath23 is proportional to the actual conduction / convection flat - flame thickness , @xmath13 , but exceeds it by a large enough numerical factor ( 15 , say ) that one may retain curvature effects in a thin front model .",
    "the new @xmath80 deduced from ( [ eq:6 ] ) reads @xmath81 when @xmath82 , with the neutral wave number : @xmath83 besides restoring well - posedness , a related virtue of the ultra - violet cut - off is to smooth the otherwise sharp front cusps ( crests ) that would form .",
    "we stress that in the present thin - flame formulation , as well as in those retaining vorticity @xcite , all the physico - chemical properties of the mixture are lumped in the fresh - to - burnt density ratio @xmath84 , in the flat - flame velocity @xmath5 ( taken here as unit of velocities ) , in the fresh gas density ( selected as unit of densities ) and in the markstein length ( more generally , in the local propagation law ) . to ease comparisons with experiments that would have access to @xmath85 , the markstein length in ( [ eq:6 ] )",
    "could be expressed as @xmath86 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the usual notation : @xmath87 for the complex velocity field , @xmath88 for the complex potential , @xmath89 being the stream - function conjugate to @xmath30 , @xmath90 for the complex variable in physical plane ; and over - bars for complex conjugation , so that @xmath91 .",
    "we also define the complex forms of @xmath92 and @xmath34 as @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "these are here evaluated at a point labelled by the arc - length coordinate @xmath95 along the front @xmath96 , oriented in such way that the burnt gases lie on its left as @xmath95 increases .",
    "let @xmath97 be the complex potential associated with a unit source of fluid located at @xmath98 in the fluid domain , satisfying @xmath99 for @xmath100 and the slip condition @xmath101 along the @xmath38th impenetrable boundary .",
    "an important property of the green s function @xmath97 in such channel - like domains as in fig.[fig1 ] , _ without or with _ ( a finite number of ) _ impenetrable obstacles _ between the lateral walls , is worth noticing .",
    "consider a streamline along which @xmath102 , issued from @xmath98 and ultimately reaching the leftmost channel wall where it splits to follow the wall to @xmath103 ; it is readily seen to be unique , as is the other one @xmath104 ultimately meeting the right wall , and doing the same there .",
    "the mass flow rates to @xmath105 are equal to @xmath106 and hence both equal @xmath107 since they sum up to the unit yield of the source .",
    "this property holds whatever @xmath98 , and is invariant by conformal mappings from the physical plane to another , since the mass flux crossing a curve is @xcite .",
    "thanks to the linearity of ( [ eq:2 ] ) one may superimpose volume sources along the front and ensure that ( [ eq:3 ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "the resulting cumulative complex velocity reads @xmath108 where the integral is over the whole flame length , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is shorthand for @xmath111 .",
    "as emphasized above , exactly half the total yield @xmath112 of the sources along the front flows to @xmath113 . at @xmath114",
    "this produces a uniform flow . to compensate for it and satisfy the condition @xmath115 at @xmath42",
    ", a supplementary flow @xmath116 must be added to @xmath117 , such that @xmath118 this @xmath116 is analytic across the front , because ( [ eq:3 ] ) is already accounted for by ( [ eq:8 ] ) , and must also satisfy the slip condition ( [ eq:4 ] ) along all impenetrable boundaries .",
    "@xmath119 will only depend on the geometry of the channel and/or obstacle(s ) under consideration and is closely related to the conformal map from the physical channel to an auxiliary straight one ( endowed with cuts for each obstacle(s ) present ) ; in particular , @xmath120 for straight channels . with @xmath121 in principle available in the bulk of the fluid , one may specialise it to the entrance of the front , then substitute in ( [ eq:5 ] ) to obtain an evolution equation for the front @xmath122 , e.g. , see equation ( [ eq:14 ] ) below .    before proceeding any",
    "further we note a general ( necessary- ) test of steadiness , obtained on integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) over the whole fresh gas domain ; by ( [ eq:6 ] ) ( and @xmath123 , @xmath124 here since @xmath125 is the same at the right and the left front ends ) , this gives @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the @xmath128-averaged front location along the @xmath40-axis : steady flames have @xmath129 , whereby @xmath130 implies that the speed of a steady flame as a whole relative to the upstream fresh medium simply is ( in units of the flat - flame speed ) the front - length to channel - width ratio ; for unsteady flame patterns , @xmath131 may in fact be _ defined _ as @xmath132 . only relying on the local propagation law ( [ eq:6 ] ) and overall mass conservation in the fresh medium , ( [ eq:10 ] )",
    "would still hold true even with vorticity retained .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , propagations of markedly wrinkled front have so far been studied numerically by means of potential flow models only for expanding fronts @xcite , i.e. , the particular situation that frankel s equation envisaged , and for bunsen types of unconfined flames attached at points @xcite ( or along a circle @xcite , for @xmath133 ) on an injection line ( or plane ) ; we consider here the case of free propagations along straight channels with parallel walls at @xmath134 without any obstacle in between , which had so far not been investigated .",
    "the green s function pertaining to neumann conditions at the walls , then denoted @xmath135 , is the familiar @xcite : @xmath136 where the symbol @xmath137 means equal up to additive functions of the primed quantities only , here @xmath98 ; these are indeed annihilated by @xmath138 , and hence would play no role in ( [ eq:8 ] ) .",
    "the cosine term in ( [ eq:11 ] ) accounts for the images in the lateral walls , and @xmath139 is @xmath140-periodic in @xmath141 .",
    "carrying the differentiation needed in ( [ eq:8 ] ) and specialising the result to the entrance of the front yields the contribution to fresh gas velocity ahead of it induced by the sources : @xmath142 the first term in the right - hand side follows from the plemelj - sokhotsky formul  for the limiting values of integrals of the cauchy type @xcite as @xmath141 approaches the integration contour ( the front , here ) . in ( [ eq:12 ] ) , and subsequent formul , @xmath143 will represent @xmath144 ; explicitly : @xmath145 as for the supplementary flow @xmath146 needed to satisfy the conditions at @xmath42 , it is uniform in the present configuration , hence is given by ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "we now have all the ingredients to write @xmath147 to obtain ( [ eq:13 ] ) we used the fact that the scalar product of any two vectors @xmath148 and @xmath149 is @xmath150 , with @xmath151 and similarly for @xmath152 . whereas @xmath153 requires principal parts , the above integrals are ordinary ones : since @xmath154 for @xmath155 , @xmath156 \\rightarrow -2l\\mathcal{c}(s)/\\pi$ ] as @xmath157 and the integrand in ( [ eq:13 ] ) is finite if @xmath158 does not lie on one of the boundaries ; if it does , @xmath159=-4l\\mathcal{c}(s)/\\pi$ ] at @xmath160 .",

    "ultimately , the leading order equation for @xmath182 reads : @xmath183 which is sivashinsky s @xcite : a ` synthesis ' of the linear result and of an eikonal equation driven by the geometry - induced @xmath184 .",

    "equations with both nonlinearities can be solved in terms of the same elementary functions ( and coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations ) _ via _ a pole decomposition technique @xcite . some issues relevant for the present work",
    "can be summarized as follows : + ( i ) thanks to the stabilizing nonlinear - term of geometrical origin , ( [ eq:15 ] ) generically leads to steady bi - coalesced fronts ( sharp maxima of @xmath186 where @xmath191 at each wall , and only there ) when integrated with the neumann boundary conditions implied by ( [ eq:4 ] ) ; steadiness of course requires that @xmath192 in accordance with the small - front - slope form of ( [ eq:10 ] ) .",
    "( ii ) several stable bi - coalesced solutions with the same @xmath193 , @xmath194 in number , exist for the same mixture properties and channel width @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "( iii ) for channel widths @xmath20 that noticeably exceed the half neutral wavelength @xmath195 , @xmath196 , the stable steady solution profiles comprise inner regions of @xmath197 width adjacent to the walls where the curvature term and @xmath23 must be retained to ensure @xmath198 , separated by an outer zone where one may omit @xmath199 ; the outer profiles are the restriction to @xmath200 of @xmath140-periodic patterns that have sharp cusps and satisfy the weaker boundary conditions @xmath201 , and are available analytically @xcite .",
    "( iv ) many unstable steady solutions exist , and their number grows with @xmath202 much faster than linearly @xcite .",
    "( v ) the slightest additive random noise in the right - hand side of ( [ eq:15 ] ) makes the flame execute random transitions between metastable states with small @xmath203 fractional variations in front length @xcite and instantaneous @xmath128-averaged speed , which can be partly understood in terms of extra singularities ( poles ) of @xmath204 sporadically implanted by the external forcing @xcite .",
    "( vi ) these properties hold for both ( [ eq:15 ] ) and its zt generalisation , i.e. , persist rather deep in the @xmath185 expansion .      essentially because @xmath205 , it was not obvious from ( [ eq:13 ] ) that an unexpanded stabilising geometry factor alone would be able to saturate hydrodynamic instability at larger scales than @xmath206 when @xmath207 , though several qualitative arguments suggested it could .",
    "firstly , this stabilising influence has a simple interpretation : if the wrinkle - induced velocity component in the local mean direction of propagation gets too high , the front can avoid being blown - off by rotating locally to ensure that ( [ eq:5 ] ) be satisfied ( like flames above bunsen burners , or the stabilized fronts to be considered next ) , which brings about the cosine @xmath208 and generates curvature - smoothed crests whenever adjacent front pieces rotate in opposite directions ; this will likely survive for large amplitudes of wrinkling .",
    "secondly , an equation of the form @xmath209 where the reciprocal cosine @xmath210 is not expanded , can be recast ( by squaring it ) into the @xmath211 form of a zt equation that , like the @xmath212 steady outer version of ( [ eq:15 ] ) with @xmath213 , possesses bounded solutions @xmath214 with sharp cusps at the walls ( but a bounded @xmath193 ) @xcite .",
    "finally , expression ( [ eq:13 ] ) giving @xmath215 for a presumed @xmath190 is ` less severe ' than the driving term @xmath216 of ( [ eq:15 ] ) , in the sense that the contributions of the integral over @xmath217 in ( [ eq:13 ] ) are comparatively less sensitive to large amplitudes of wrinkling ; the reason is that the trigonometric functions in ( [ eq:12i ] ) are bounded when their arguments get large imaginary whereas the linear operator @xmath218 with a real cotangent as kernel does not ` saturate ' for @xmath219 , which likely results in a milder source of wrinkling than in ( [ eq:15i ] ) .    to determine the front wrinkle evolution / shape(s ) when @xmath220 and significant nonlinear effects set in , we resorted to a numerical integration of ( [ eq:13])([eq:14 ] ) . to this end ,",
    "the integral featured in ( [ eq:13 ] ) was discretised at nodes @xmath221 , and computed by the trapezoidal method , account being taken that the integrand in ( [ eq:13 ] ) is continuous at @xmath160 ( see above eq.([eq:14 ] ) ) .",
    "the local front curvature @xmath222 is calculated by passing a circle through @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , which also gives @xmath226 then @xmath227 .",
    "the normal node displacements @xmath228 resulting from ( [ eq:13])([eq:14 ] ) enable one to locate the flame at @xmath229 .",

    "the above mentioned procedure to generate unstable multi - crested fronts for wide channels can be extended by concatenating replicas of halved periodic patterns of a smaller minimal wavelength @xmath252 than @xmath20 ( with @xmath253 = integer ) , but such flames with several crests would also be unstable against slight lateral shifts or compression of any of them ; the unstable flame fronts labelled 1.47 ( @xmath254 ) and 1.30 ( @xmath255 ) in fig.[fig2 ] were obtained in this manner .",
    "the solutions labelled 1.49 and 1.58 were both obtained by the time marching numerical method without the ` replica - trick ' , however , and hence represent two different ( meta-)stable solutions of the same problem in the same operating conditions !    thus , the picture is somehow reminiscent of that deduced for @xmath256 from ( [ eq:15 ] ) and its zt higher - order generalisation , when endowed with neumann conditions ( see end of the preceding subsection ) : many unstable steady states ( at least @xmath257 in number , thanks to the ` replica trick ' ) , several meta - stable steady fronts ; to which one may add the sensitivity to noise when @xmath258 .",

    "next , for flames kinematically positioned ahead of a central obstacle at a distance larger than or comparable to @xmath348 , one may omit direct counter - streamwise conductive / viscous transfers to / from the obstacle , since those decay exponentially quickly over an @xmath349 distance to the latter .",
    "one may also note that the obstacle and its images in the channel boundaries constitute a @xmath20-periodic configuration , whereby the @xmath134 lines need not represent material surfaces , only lines of symmetry , and hence do not necessarily bring about viscous effects .    in the ideal - flow simplified formulation we consider here ,",
    "the way the @xmath128-averaged front location , @xmath350 , varies at steady state when @xmath351 approaches zero can be estimated as follows , if one anticipates that the front shape can be described by @xmath352 : here @xmath190 is the steady free pattern belonging to @xmath193 ( properly shifted , since eq.([eq:13 ] ) is translation - invariant along the @xmath40-axis ) and @xmath353 is a small correction to its shape induced by the obstacles at large , but finite , distance from the front .",

    "one is led to conclude that @xmath365 and @xmath366 generically are of same magnitude and , if the obstacle is to have an influence on @xmath60 , both need be @xmath367 .",
    "this simple order - of - magnitude balance leads to : @xmath368 for @xmath243 just above @xmath193 .",

    "if the barely settled fronts happen not to stay steady , the situation is less clear . as pointed by an anonymous referee",

    "if the profile belonging to the largest speed @xmath373 has a special symmetry and the generic one has the second largest @xmath374 with @xmath375 , a transient flash - back may take place until the symmetry is destroyed by the slightest disturbance , leading to a front that ultimately settles near the obstacle .",
    "this can become really complicated if the very fact that the front approaches the obstacle restores the aforementioned symmetry ( hence @xmath376 ) , as seems to be the case in fig.[fig4](a ) : oscillating @xmath127 are not excluded then . in the simpler situation",

    "these asymptotic trends could not be accurately checked in steady cases up to very large @xmath243s for two reasons .",
    "first , as @xmath243 gets high , the front curvature at its base , @xmath442 , approaches that of the obstacle , @xmath443 , and the adopted local burning speed @xmath444 decreases accordingly ; it may even vanish there if @xmath445 and further increasing @xmath243 would result in flame blow - off .",
    "before such high velocities were reached , however , numerical noise came back into play . using a higher spatial resolution to reduce it is costly , as the cpu effort for the simulation of a fixed time lapse grows with the number @xmath446 of numerical nodes like @xmath447 ( @xmath448 from the constraint @xmath449 , another factor of @xmath448 from the non - convolution integrals , eq.([eq:8 ] ) ) , but this suppresses the sub - wrinkles ;",

    "the plot also shows the corresponding streamlines obtained here by integration of @xmath451 ( since the front is steady ) with @xmath452 given by ( [ eq:8])([eq:20])([eq:26 ] ) ; note their refraction as they cross the front , caused by @xmath453 having a jump and @xmath454 being continuous there , see ( [ eq:3 ] ) and above .",
    "although the precise origin and way of action of such a numerical noise are not under full control hence not completely clear , the interpolation jitter caused by dynamical node monitoring where the front curvature gets high ( near crests or the obstacle ) , undoubtedly plays a role ( finer resolutions remove it ) , and acts as a spurious random source of normal node displacements , hence of front deformations . the mechanism of amplification of small noise - induced wrinkles is the same as in @xcite , and involves the interplay of curvature effect , hydrodynamic instability , wavelength stretching and , here , interactions with front images .",
    "when the tangential velocity @xmath32 is high and uniform along the unperturbed front the instability may only be convective ( as opposed to absolute ) @xcite , and the drifting sub - wrinkles triggered by tiny numerical noise would eventually have max(@xmath80)=@xmath455 as lagrangian growth rate and @xmath456 as final wavelength (= 0.628 for @xmath246 , @xmath392 ) if @xmath457 is large enough , which is experimentally known @xcite . here , confinement makes @xmath32 increase along the @xmath40-axis ( fig.[fig5 ] ) and the wavelengths @xmath252 also increase as the sub - wrinkles approach the flame tip @xcite .",
    "more precisely , since @xmath458 , fig.[fig5 ] , the wavelength ultimately increases with @xmath95 according to the `` node conservation '' law @xmath459 and hence also ends up varying linearly with current arclength @xmath95 ; this can be detected in fig.[fig4](a ) . by the same token",
    ", the wrinkles also get closer to the lateral walls , which tends to quench their growth in amplitude ( not in wavelength ) through potential interactions with their closest image in the walls , even in absence of significant nonlinear effects : the low-@xmath69 growth rate @xmath460 of disturbances about a front nearly parallel to an impermeable wall in the fresh gases , and lying at a distance @xmath461 to it , is indeed reduced by an extra factor of @xmath462 @xcite .",
    "this follows from the fact that a near harmonic wrinkle of local shape @xmath463 , with the amplitude @xmath464 and @xmath465 varying over some scale @xmath466 , induces in the fresh gas potential flow a disturbance in @xmath467 that locally decays with coordinate @xmath468 normal to the front like @xmath469 ; the image ` beyond ' the wall at a distance @xmath470 does the same ... up to a reversed sign of @xmath464 and the change of @xmath468 into @xmath471 , which ensures that the slip condition @xmath440 at the walls is satisfied and does reduce the @xmath472-fluctuation felt by the front at @xmath473 .",

    "there exist several mathematical ways of growing bumps out of smooth surfaces @xcite , but here we chose to exploit the material already presented above : the selected bumps will consist of the two mirror - symmetric halves ( left and right ) of the preceding obstacle , stuck on the walls with the convex parts facing inward ( fig.[fig6 ] ) .",

    "we invoke the supplementary complex potential @xmath276 defined by ( [ eq:27 ] ) , and notice that the streamlines it generates are symmetric by @xmath240 and @xmath489 , is regular at finite distance along the lines @xmath134 , and can be analytically continued periodically along the @xmath128-axis ; this , actually can also be seen from the identities ( [ eq:23])([eq:24 ] ) .",
    "so , once properly normalised and translated , the above ` inert flow ' @xmath490 can provide one with a natural change of complex plane .",

    "the supplementary flow needed in @xmath495 has in fact already been found and , by construction , is simply given by @xmath496 , with @xmath497 once ( [ eq:9 ] ) is accounted for .",
    "the contribution @xmath498 is accessible from ( [ eq:8])([eq:30 ] ) , and @xmath146 on @xmath488-differentiation of ( [ eq:31 ] ) , which ultimately yields : @xmath499 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] thereby giving one access to an evolution equation again formally identical to ( [ eq:14 ] )    whenever the front shape are steady and symmetric by @xmath500 , they coincide with those obtained in sec.4 , up to an horizontal shift by @xmath501 and a mirror symmetry ; these are not duplicated here .",
    "the response to small - scale random noise is different . in sec.4 ,",
    "the sub - wrinkles observed near the flame tips were constrained by the nearby walls to form ` varicose ' type of patterns @xcite , i.e. , symmetric under @xmath502 .",
    "when the front leading edges sit near lateral bumps , however , the flame tip is not that constrained any longer and can preferentially develop , fig.[fig6 ] , the ` sinuous ' ( anti - symmetric in @xmath503 at @xmath504 scale ) mode of wrinkling because it has a larger growth rate than the varicose one @xcite : the ` dl ' effects of the near - facing sides of the front , at a mutual distance of @xmath505 , then reinforce one another instead of mutually cancelling partly as they did for the varicose mode ( see end of sec.4 ) , which enhances the low-@xmath69 growth rate of harmonic disturbances by an extra factor of @xmath506 @xcite whereby the ( again lagrangian ) growth / decay rate @xmath63 becomes : @xmath507 to be compared with @xmath508 in ( [ eq : variceux ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath509 , reached at @xmath510 and @xmath511 , is @xmath512 , implying a strong preferential amplification of the sinuous mode near the flame tip .",
    "both growth rates can be used to estimate the ratio in final sub - wrinkle amplitudes with interaction between near parallel fronts ( @xmath513 or @xmath514 ) . instead of linearizing ( [ eq:32 ] ) about a symmetric steady pattern @xmath515  then trying to solve the linear problem at the expense of extra heavy algebra , a simple wkb type of physical argument @xcite is presented below when @xmath372 and @xmath516 , @xmath517 . to this end",
    "we again interpret @xmath518 and @xmath519 as describing disturbance growths with lagrangian time @xmath520 , related to @xmath95 by @xmath521 @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath522 when the unperturbed front sides are far apart , the final @xmath523 is obtained on integrating @xmath524 along the entire front .",
    "the needed @xmath32 and @xmath525 follow from the analytic steady shape @xmath515 at @xmath369 ( or its inverse @xmath526 ) , as is deduced from the properly shifted eq.([eq:28bbis ] ) ( @xmath527 replaced by @xmath528 there ) and the corresponding linear variation of @xmath32 ; @xmath529 is given by the ` node conservation ' law @xmath530 acknowledging that the dominant growth of @xmath531 takes place near the flame tip , one may even approximate @xmath532 and @xmath533 by their late behaviour ( i.e. , set @xmath534 and freeze @xmath465 to some @xmath535 therein ) .",
    "the final ( @xmath536-independent ) estimate of the sinuous - to - varicose amplitude near the flame tip reads : @xmath537 with @xmath246 , this is only 7.34 but sufficient to make @xmath513 still hardly visible when the sinuous mode becomes detectable ( @xmath538 , say ) near the flame tip .",
    "furthermore , the newly born cells are too curved once fully formed to be further affected by noise @xcite before they reach the tip , and in no way can the varicose mode emerge once the sinuous mode has appeared .",
    "put in words : the wrinkled front responds to random noise as to avoid self - intersections hence the formation of blobs of fresh gas detaching from the main front s tip ; this is experimentally known @xcite and intervenes in how to reduce emissions of combustion - induced noise @xcite . like in fig.[fig4 ] the sub - wrinkles noticeably increase the front length per unit length as they travel up the @xmath40-axis , which gradually reduces the total flame height since the time - averaged front length is @xmath539 in any case , by ( [ eq:10 ] ) ; this flame - brush shortening by cusped cells is well known experimentally , even in some turbulent flames @xcite .",
    "very large amplification ratios proportional to @xmath540 explain why even residual , hardly measurable , turbulence is enough to trigger the appearance of sub - wrinkles along unconfined bunsen flames at high ambient pressure @xmath7 @xcite : simply because the grouping @xmath541 scales like @xmath542 for most usual hydrocarbon / air pre - mixtures ( @xmath543 , @xmath544 ) , which results in huge variations of its exponential as @xmath7 increases ( up to 100 bars in @xcite ) , at fixed @xmath545 not to modify the flame height - to - width ratio . possibly for related reasons ,",
    "many laboratory burners tend to have comparatively small values of @xmath457 , resulting from rather small @xmath546 ratios , smaller than the @xmath547 in fig.[fig6 ] : the little confined bunsen - burner flame in figure 3 of @xcite has @xmath548 ( @xmath549 for lean propane / air mixture @xcite ) , like the upper half of the @xmath487 front shown in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "an evolution equation for the flame front ( only ) , with built - in boundary conditions and each operating parameter adjustable at will , constitutes a flexible tool .",
    "the example considered next to make the point , selected because it relates to flame response to incident pressure waves @xcite , deals with fronts near an obstacle then at lateral bumps , and fed at an oscillating injection velocity @xmath550 .    before proceeding to the results of numerical integrations proper , it is of interest to again consider the large-@xmath243 limit , now in unsteady situations .",
    "the analysis leading to ( [ eq:28bbis ] ) can indeed be adapted almost _ mutatis mutandis _ to slowly - varying flames and velocity components ; this merely requires to include @xmath551 in the kinematic conditions ( [ eq : a2 ] ) and gives a partial differential equation for @xmath552 : @xmath553 \\ } = -1,\\ ] ] in which the inlet velocity @xmath243 is assumed to evolve on the @xmath554 time scale . the hyperbolic eq .",
    "( [ eq:28c ] ) can be solved with the boundary conditions @xmath555 , corresponding to a front leading edge near an obstacle for @xmath372 , on the grounds that the left undetermined @xmath556 shift in ( [ eq:28bbis ] ) does not depend on @xmath243 , and hence is time independent here ; a @xmath35-dependent @xmath557 would shift @xmath558 to @xmath559 in ( [ eq:29 ] ) .",
    "the long - time solution to ( [ eq:28c ] ) , once written in the form @xmath560 like in ( [ eq:28bbis ] ) , reads @xmath561 with @xmath562 , so that @xmath563 and @xmath564 . for @xmath565",
    "this resumes ( [ eq:28bbis ] ) , and when @xmath558 is periodic , the time - averaged @xmath566 is still given by ( [ eq:28bbis ] ) with @xmath243 replaced by @xmath567 . with the aforementioned oscillating @xmath558 , ( [ eq:29 ] )",
    "produces wavy fronts undulating in a harmonic way and lagging behind the injection velocity with a phase shift encoded in @xmath568 ; these are not unlike either side of ( nearly- ) confined experimental bunsen flames fed with a slowly oscillating @xmath243 ( e.g. , fig 9(b)(c ) in @xcite ) .",
    "yet there exists an important difference caused by the more elongated shape , relating to the pulsation @xmath569 needed to `` imprint '' @xmath570 cells along a flame of half front length @xmath408 . for unconfined or weakly confined bunsen- or v - flames @xcite",
    ", one needs @xmath571 (= 15.7 for @xmath247 , @xmath572 ) ; with the present confinement , our model requires a pulsation larger by the factor @xmath573 (= 2.5 for @xmath246 ) ; a close scrutiny of the @xmath73 and @xmath246 curves in fig.[fig7](a ) makes the point .",
    "once combined with the related change in steady profiles , also caused by the confinement , this variation in cell number and the accompanying wavelength stretching quite logically are somewhat at variance with experiments on the usually unconfined @xcite , or barely confined @xcite , burner flames .",
    "another noticeable feature of eq .",
    "( [ eq:28c ] ) is the absence of any dl - like mechanism of instability at this order : a damping term @xmath574 even appears on expanding the braces of eq .",
    "( [ eq:28c ] ) , stemming from a negative @xmath575 and thus resulting from the confinement that breaks the translation invariance along the @xmath128-axis . to explain this absence of any dl mechanism in eq .",
    "( [ eq:28c ] ) we note that the wave number belonging to such wavy fronts is @xmath576 , whereby the associated growth rate @xmath577 is negligible compared to @xmath578 . such a conclusion would thus still hold true even if the flame were not symmetric any longer ... yet still varying over the same long time - scale as above .",
    "the hydrodynamic instability will thus manifest itself only at high enough pulsations @xmath569 that the resulting cells along the front have @xmath579 , which here requires higher @xmath569s : to fix the idea , the preceding estimate with the @xmath72-dependent factor of 2.5 included , gives @xmath580 for @xmath572 . in turn",
    "this will bring back the nonlinear and curvature effects ( also negligible in ( [ eq:28c ] ) ) , thereby necessitating numerical integrations .",
    "note that the natural exponential decay of the @xmath472-disturbances with distance to the flame and its images in the walls ( see above equation ( [ eq : variceux ] ) ) strongly reduces the flame / images interactions when @xmath581 , thereby somehow restoring translational invariance for the shorter wrinkles ( especially when appearing near the tip and along the channel centreline ) ; in particular , these get little subjected to the damping featured in ( [ eq:28c ] )",
    ".    figure [ fig7 ] shows numerically obtained fronts settled near an obstacle or bumps , fed at the same oscillating velocity @xmath550 , with @xmath247 , @xmath392 , @xmath393 , @xmath582 , and @xmath246 in most cases ( see caption of fig.[fig7 ] ) . to guide the eye , a front corresponding to the same parameters as above but without gas expansion ( @xmath73 in lieu of @xmath246 ) ,",
    "is also plotted as a thin line in fig.[fig7](a ) : suppressing the dl - like instability mechanism for frequencies leading to @xmath581 does affect the amplitude of the flame response , despite the larger @xmath583 instead of 6 , and gives a larger @xmath584 because this also increases the @xmath585 ratio to 1 ; this also suppresses the wavelength stretching . as was the case for the growth rates",
    "@xmath460 then about the effective speed @xmath193 of free flames , the present formulation plausibly overestimates the consequence of @xmath586 on the amplitude of wrinkling , however , especially near the tip(s ) .",
    "this trend of potential - flow models should be kept in mind when comparing the present results at @xmath586 with data on actual flames responding to incident pressure waves ; yet flames anchored at the rim of a bunsen burner look like fig.[fig7](b ) when excited by a loudspeaker to generate oscillating @xmath243s @xcite ... once the selected frequency @xmath569 properly accounts for the shorter time of transit along the unperturbed front when a confinement is present .",
    "one can note the appearance of a sinuous mode of sub - wrinkling at high mean injection velocities , fig.[fig7](b ) , again triggered by numerical noise : if allowed by the problem symmetries , this eventually catches over the varicose - type of mode generated by a pulsating uniform injection , and leads to flame tip flickering .",
    "although not unphysical ( unwanted flickering often appears in experiments ) and removable here by using a finer  yet ` costly '  resolution , this influence of noise should be under better control and accounted for explicitly , instead of appearing as a side effect .",
    "the _ implicit _ method of @xcite shows good prospects of improvements because it allows for much larger time - steps without sacrificing spatial resolution .",
    "however , this will not change the fact that each of the @xmath446 nodes in the discretized integral evolution equation(s ) is coupled at any one time step to its @xmath587 neighbours , in the long - range manner that characterises @xmath21 laplace problems , whereby evaluating @xmath48 at time @xmath35 requires @xmath588 operations ; adapting hierarchical algorithms developed for similar @xmath446-body problems ( e.g. , @xcite ) to reduce this to @xmath589 , yet at the expense of high noise levels , would greatly help fully exploit the evolution equation approach , at least for flames randomly forced on purpose where statistics ( hence long runs ) are often needed .",
    "in three configurations ( free evolutions , obstacles of two different kinds ) we showed that green s functions and conformal map methods , combined with numerical integrations of the corresponding frankel type evolution equations we derived , can indeed simultaneously account for flame / flow nonlocal interactions , large front deformations and nontrivial boundary geometries ( including multiply - connected domains ) .",
    "once the numerical method is properly optimized , this approach will be able to handle flames of even larger lateral extents @xmath20 than here ( in fig.[fig4 ] , @xmath590 , for the same mixture as in figure 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the shapes / evolutions of channelled fronts so obtained share a lot with actual flames : hydrodynamic instability , formation of cusped cells , sensitivity to noise when wide enough ( or at high pressure ) , sinuous mode of final wrinkling , asymmetric free flames ; yet the potential - flow models were found to overestimate the consequences of density changes on the wrinkle rate - of - growth and final amplitudes , while the laboratory fronts seldom are as confined as the channelled ones considered here  with identified consequences on the flame morphology  and often are of smaller lateral extent .",
    "besides the above mentioned physical and numerical issues , the present models raise interesting mathematical related questions , two of which are now evoked .",
    "first , it would be interesting to explore whether potential - flow models of steady flames with @xmath220 admit solutions in the limit @xmath591 . and",
    "if they do , like ( [ eq:15])([eq:15i ] ) , is there again a continuum of allowed flame fronts @xcite that is broken into a densely - packed discrete set thereof ( with very nearby @xmath592s ) when small-@xmath250 effects are restored ( which relates to flash back ) ?",
    "second , as the steady version of ( [ eq:6 ] ) with a _ prescribed _ potential fresh - gas flow - field @xmath593 and the poisson equation with given sources along a _ prescribed _",
    "front @xmath594 ) @xcite admit separate variational formulations , is there an extremum principle for steady potential - flow flame models ? ( and , if ` yes ' , what does the corresponding ` action ' physically mean ? ) .",
    "this could possibly help clarifying why potential - flow apparently overestimate the influence of @xmath595 in comparison with actual flames , in case the ` action ' in question would have a second variation of definite sign .",
    "one must indeed not forget that actual flames are also affected by vorticity , @xmath596 . as regards it , first notice that the expression for the complex velocity @xmath597 at the entrance of the free flame fronts studied in sec.3 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) ( [ eq:12 ] ) , can be re - written in operator form as : @xmath598 = \\int \\frac{[\\boldsymbol{n}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{u}]}{2l}\\ , ds,\\ ] ] where @xmath599\\equiv ( e-1)\\ , \\sigma(s)$ ] measures the strength of volume sources along the front , the operator @xmath600 is _ minus _ the principal - part integration over @xmath601 appearing in ( [ eq:12 ] ) , and @xmath602 is the identity .",
    "the last equation , ( [ eq : conclusion ] ) , closely resembles eq.(42 ) obtained in @xcite for steady flames in straight channels , and is actually an integrated vorticity - free version thereof .",
    "the integration constant is determined in the present @xmath603 model via an overall mass balance ; on the other hand , the @xmath128-differentiated equation in @xcite has a distribution of vortices along the front besides ( modified ) sources of volume , which is missing here and formally amounts to supplementing ( [ eq:3 ] ) with a suitable @xmath604- and @xmath605-dependent jump @xmath606 $ ] .",
    "as shown above , the shape of non - straight channels or obstacles can be encoded in the green s functions , which here changed the @xmath600 operator into a more general form @xmath607 , since @xmath608 , see ( [ eq:30 ] ) ; this also made the right hand side of ( [ eq : conclusion ] ) a known function of @xmath158 stemming from @xmath609 , i.e. , from the nonlinear maps from the physical to the auxiliary planes ( for example , see eq.([eq:31 ] ) ) , which can thus be adapted to more general channels than the asymptotically - straight ones considered here .",
    "the important step to take up now clearly is to investigate how the approach of @xcite adapts to such situations .",
    "after all , the green s function associated with a point - vortex in the annulus of fig.[fig3 ] and neumann conditions also is expressible in terms of the same function @xmath610 as in ( [ eq:20 ] ) .",
    "this will be pursued elsewhere .",
    "thanks to the scale disparity @xmath611 , @xmath612 in the laplace equations separately satisfied by @xmath613 and @xmath614 , whereby both functions are affine functions of @xmath128 with @xmath40-dependent coefficients , to the two leading orders in @xmath615 .",
    "the slip condition @xmath616 gives @xmath617 , @xmath618 for @xmath619 and @xmath620 ; @xmath621 and @xmath622 for @xmath623 .",
    "the zero - vorticity condition @xmath624 implies @xmath625 , whereas the continuity in tangential velocity ( hence in @xmath626 ) at the front requires @xmath627 ( @xmath628 ) : @xmath629 is uniform over the channel cross section .",
    "finally incompressibility , eq.([eq:1 ] ) , implies @xmath630 ( @xmath631 ) and yields the differential relation @xmath632 .",
    "since @xmath633 and @xmath634 one gets @xmath635 when ( [ eq:3 ] ) ( [ eq:5 ] ) are applied on either front side ; curvature effects are omitted since @xmath636 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : a2 ] ) and above it that @xmath637 , whereby @xmath638 . to evaluate @xmath639 ,",
    "one acknowledges that @xmath640 represents the @xmath128-independent @xmath629 over the entire region @xmath641 , and must match the value prevailing at the entrance of @xmath412 zone , namely @xmath243 to leading order ( only ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath642 . combined with ( [ eq : a2 ] ) this gives eq.([eq:28bbis ] ) of the main text on integration of the differential equation for @xmath643 .",
    "also , @xmath644 , @xmath645 , and the preceding @xmath646 give access to the streamlines wherever ( [ eq:28bbis ] ) holds ."
