    "massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems promise tremendous performance gains in terms of network throughput and energy efficiency by employing simple coherent processing across arrays of hundreds or even thousands of base station ( bs ) antennas , serving tens or hundreds of mobile terminals @xcite . as an additional benefit ,",
    "massive mimo is inherently more secure than conventional mimo systems , as the large - scale antenna array equipped at the bs ( alice ) can accurately focus a narrow and directional information beam on the intended terminals ( bob ) , such that the received signal power at bob is several orders of magnitude higher than that at any incoherent passive eavesdropper ( eve ) @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this benefit may vanish if eve also employs a massive antenna array for eavesdropping . in this case , unless additional measures to secure the communication are taken by alice , even a single passive eve is able to intercept the signal intended for bob @xcite .    since security is a critical concern for future communication systems , facilitating secrecy at the physical layer of massive mimo systems",
    "has received significant attention recently . artificial noise (",
    "an ) generation @xcite was employed to provide physical layer security in a multi - cell massive mimo system with pilot contamination in @xcite .",
    "thereby , it was shown that secure communication can be achieved even with simple matched filter ( mf ) precoding of the data and null - space ( ns ) precoding of the an .",
    "nevertheless , it was revealed in @xcite that significant additional performance gains are possible with more sophisticated data and an precoders , including polynomial precoders .",
    "furthermore , an - aided jamming of rician fading massive mimo channels was investigated in @xcite .",
    "all aforementioned works on secure massive mimo are based on the assumption that the transceivers of the legitimate users are equipped with perfect hardware components , i.e. , the effects of hardware impairments were not taken into account .",
    "nevertheless , all practical implementations do suffer from impairments arising from non - ideal hardware components @xcite .",
    "these impairments are expected to be particularly pronounced in massive mimo systems as the excessive number of bs antennas makes the use of low - cost components desirable to keep the overall capital expenditures for operators manageable .",
    "several works have investigated the impact of hardware impairments on massive mimo systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these works demonstrated that hardware impairments can severely limit the performance of massive mimo systems , and that phase noise originating from free - running oscillators is the main contributor in degrading the quality of the channel state information ( csi ) estimates needed for precoder design . on the one hand",
    ", phase noise causes the csi estimates to become outdated more quickly , and on the other hand , it may cause a loss of orthogonality of the pilot sequences employed by the different users in a cell for uplink training .",
    "if communication secrecy is considered , an additional challenge arises : whereas the legitimate users of the system will likely employ low - cost equipment giving rise to hardware impairments , the eavesdropper is expected to employ high - quality equipment and avoid hardware impairments .",
    "this disparity in equipment quality was not considered in the related work on physical layer security @xcite-@xcite nor in the related work on hardware impairments @xcite-@xcite and necessitates the development of a new analysis and design framework .",
    "motivated by the above considerations , in this paper , we present the first study of physical layer security for massive mimo systems in the presence of phase noise .",
    "thereby , we focus on the downlink and investigate the effects of multiplicative phase noise at the bs and the users . as a worst - case scenario ,",
    "the eavesdropper is assumed to employ ideal ( phase noise - free ) hardware .",
    "we derive a tight lower bound for the ergodic secrecy rate achieved by a downlink user in the presence of phase noise when mf data precoding and ns an precoding are employed at the massive mimo bs .",
    "the derived bound provides insight into the impact of various system and channel parameters , such as the phase noise variance , the amount of power allocated to the an , the number of users , and the number of deployed local oscillators ( los ) on the ergodic secrecy rate .",

    "<S> in this paper , we investigate the impact of phase noise on the secrecy performance of downlink massive mimo systems in the presence of a passive multiple - antenna eavesdropper . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , for the base station ( bs ) and the legitimate users , the effect of multiplicative phase noise is taken into account , whereas the eavesdropper is assumed to employ ideal hardware . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a lower bound for the ergodic secrecy rate of a given user when matched filter data precoding and artificial noise transmission are employed at the bs . </S>",
    "<S> based on the derived analytical expression , we investigate the impact of the various system parameters on the secrecy rate . </S>",
    "<S> our analytical and simulation results reveal that distributively deployed local oscillators ( los ) can achieve a better performance than one common lo for all bs antennas as long as a sufficient amount of power is assigned for data transmission . </S>"
