    "the present study is devoted to modeling a formation of a soft ( ordered ) material known as the non  kossel crystal @xcite , as well as to propose how to model a polycrystalline aggregate termed the soft - matter spherulite @xcite .",
    "the approach we are exploring throughout this paper assumes that the system of interest is a mesoscopic system @xcite , by its nature combining both classical and quantum - mechanical properties , though we are offering here a description based on nonequilibrium statistical thermodynamics , taken suitably at a mesoscopic ( molecular cluster ) level @xcite , i.e. a classical limit of the approach can preferentially be exploited @xcite .",
    "in general , examples of soft materials include biopolymers and charged polymer solutions , protein / membrane complexes , colloidal suspensions , gels , nucleic acids and their assemblies , to mention but a few .",
    "most forms of condensed matter - except of metals and ceramics ( perhaps ) @xcite - are soft and these substances are composed of aggregates and macromolecules , with interactions that are too weak and complex to form crystals spontaneously ; therefore , the task of how to grow crystals in complex environments still remains a real challenge @xcite .",
    "thus , the phrase soft condensed matter has been coined , also for the clear reasons mentioned below .",
    "first , a striking feature is that slight perturbations in temperature , pressure or concentration , or small ( piconewton ) external forces , can all be enough to essentially induce microstructural changes .",
    "second , thermal fluctuations are almost by definition pronounced in soft materials , and in consequence , entropy is a privileged determinant of a soft microstructure formation , so that disorder , slow dynamics and kinetics , and plastic deformation are the rules @xcite . although soft materials have attracted engineers for ages , only recently have physicists taken an interest in such materials , and attempted to implement what is the essence of physics , that is to produce , at various levels of description , simple models that include the possible minimum information required to explain relevant features , cf .",
    "an example concerning proteins @xcite .",
    "nowadays , especially with the advent of single molecule spectroscopies are we managing to get quantitative data on things such as aggregation ( and folding ) effects in complex biomolecular environments , motion of molecular motors @xcite , electron and proton transfer rates @xcite , etc .",
    ", that are sufficiently reliable to formulate and test simple models .",
    "the availability of new experimental tools and simulation capability are urging physicists to apply their methods to structural biology , i.e. to allow the prediction of structure on the basis of known microscopic forces .",
    "a key issue is the fact that the environments in which a formation of the soft material happens are characteristic of pronounced spatial variations in dielectric constant , e.g. water and lipids @xcite .",
    "it is of major importance to realize that competition between interactions of different ranges results in different types of aggregation of molecules .",
    "the starting point should thus be about a discussion of the relative role of the various fundamental interactions in such systems ( electrostatic , hydrophobic , conformational , steric , van der waals , etc . ) , and what is their real impact on the aggregation of possibly ordered ( crystal formation ) and/or disordered types .",
    "the next focus could be on how these competing interactions influence the form ( and , topology ) of soft and biological matter , like biopolymers and proteins , leading to self - assembling systems of the type listed above @xcite .    in the underlying study ,",
    "let us propose a way of modeling the soft matter objects named non  kossel crystals @xcite , and in part also the biopolymeric spheroidal polycrystals , commonly termed spherulites . the way that we have chosen to achieve the above stated goal is based on the assumption that the biomolecular system , generally out of equilibrium , can be best described at a mesoscopic level , using the conception of mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics ( mnet ) @xcite , section 2 . in sections 3 and 4 , we will offer the thermodynamic - kinetic description of the soft material formation first by introducing its deterministic part ( section 3 ) , and second , by going to its stochastic , no doubt , more interesting part ( section 4 ) . in the deterministic part , we wish to place our emphasis on an unquestionable basis of each soft material formation , namely , how does the material formation depend upon the boundary effect , being typically curvature - dependent , and having also - in the case of spherulites - a nonequilibrium kinetic account readily involved in the overall process . in the stochastic part , in turn , we are lucky to support our mesoscopic view by a microscopic picture of a sub - process , essentially limiting the model material formation in the crystal boundary layer @xcite . here , we have in mind the physical fact that the growth of the objects that we model can thoroughly be controlled by the macroion velocity field of the crystal ambient phase nearby its interface with the growing crystal . since it may lead to some very interesting physical consequences , e.g. a time - dependent viscosity effect @xcite ( section 4 ) , we are going to exploit this experimentally justified observation @xcite in a sufficient detail , looking at the macroion finite - size effect ( fse ) , see section 4 . ] , and its impact on the overall crystallization process seen as a combination of static ( curvature - oriented ) and dynamic ( constrained motion - oriented ) effects in the crystal s growth layer @xcite . concluding address , contained in section 5 , closes the paper .",
    "mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics ( mnet ) provides a general framework from which one can study the dynamics of systems defined at the mesoscale @xcite , and has been applied to analyze different irreversible processes taking place at those scales @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the theory is based on the fact that a reduction of the observational time and length scales of a system usually entails an increase in the number of degrees of freedom which have not yet equilibrated and that therefore exert an influence on the overall dynamics of the system .",
    "those degrees of freedom @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) may for example represent the velocity of a particle , the orientation of a spin , the size of a macromolecule or any coordinate or order parameter whose values properly define the state of a mesoscopic system in a phase space .",
    "the characterization of the state of the system essentially relies on the knowledge of @xmath2 the probability density of finding the system at the state @xmath3 at time @xmath4 one can then formulate the gibbs entropy postulate @xcite in the form @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the entropy of the system when the degrees of freedom @xmath0 are at equilibrium .",
    "if they are not , the contribution to the entropy arises from deviations of the probability density @xmath7 from its equilibrium value @xmath8 given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the minimum reversible work required to create that state @xcite , @xmath11 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath12 is the temperature of the heat bath .",
    "variations of the minimum work for a thermodynamic system are expressed as    @xmath13    where ( using a standard notation ) extensive quantities refer to the system and intensive ones to the bath .",
    "the last term represents the work performed on the system to modify its surface @xmath14 , whereas @xmath15 stands for the surface tension .    to obtain the dynamics of the mesoscopic degrees of freedom one",
    "first takes variations in eq .",
    "( [ entropy postulate ] ) @xmath16 focusing only on the nonequilibrated degrees of freedom .",
    "the probability density evolves in the @xmath17space according with the continuity equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an unknown probability current . to obtain its value ,",
    "one proceeds to derive the expression of the entropy change , @xmath20 , which follows from the continuity equation ( [ continuity1 ] ) and the gibbs equation ( [ variations of gibbs entropy post ] ) . after a partial integration ,",
    "one then arrives at    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the entropy flux , and @xmath23 is the entropy production which is expressed in terms of currents and conjugated thermodynamic forces defined in the space of mesoscopic variables .",
    "we will now assume a linear dependency between fluxes and forces and establish a linear relationship between them @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an onsager coefficient , which depends on the mesoscopic coordinates @xmath0 ; in general , it also depends on the state variable @xmath7 . to derive this expression , locality in @xmath17space",
    "has also been taken into account , for which only fluxes and forces with the same value of @xmath0 become coupled .",
    "the resulting kinetic equation then follows by substituting eq .",
    "( [ corriente1 ] ) back into the continuity equation ( [ continuity1 ] )    @xmath26    where we have defined the diffusion coefficient as @xmath27 .",
    "this equation , which in view of eq .",
    "( [ peq general ] ) can also be written as    @xmath28    is the fokker - planck equation accounting for the evolution of the probability density in @xmath0-space .",
    "the expression of the nucleation rates can be obtained from the proposed formalism @xcite . to this purpose",
    "one has to interpret the nucleation ( or in general any activated process ) as a diffusion process along the mesoscopic coordinate describing the state of the system , the embryos , at short time scales in between the metastable and the crystal phases .",
    "the reaction rate or diffusion current can be written in terms of the fugacity @xmath29 as @xmath30 the current can also be expressed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the diffusion coefficient . as a first approximation we assume that @xmath33 and integrate from the initial to the final position , obtaining @xmath34 this equation can alternatively be expressed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the integrated rate , @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the affinity . we have then shown that a mesoscopic thermodynamic analysis may lead to the formulation of the nonlinear kinetic laws governing nucleation processes .",
    "nucleation processes in which the embryos are embedded in an inhomogeneous bath can also be studied by means of the theory proposed @xcite .",
    "mnet can in general be used to study kinetic processes taking place in mesostructures such as the nanostructure arrays @xcite .",
    "the size of these structures is in between those of single particles and macroscopic objects .",
    "they carry out assembling ( clustering ) and impingement ( pattern formation ) processes .",
    "they may also diffuse in a thermal bath , be convected by external flow and be affected by external driving forces as those acting in extrusion , shearing , injection processes involved in the mechanical processing of a melt .",
    "the growth rate of the agglomerates can be determined by the formalism previously presented in which the mesoscopic variable is the volume of the grain .",
    "one formulates the gibbs entropy postulate in terms of the probability density @xmath39 , where now the degree of freedom @xmath0 is @xmath40 - the volume of the grain or molecular cluster . proceeding as indicated previously one obtains the growth rate @xmath41\\ ] ] interpreting @xmath42 as an entropic potential @xcite and assuming that the volume - dependent onsager coefficient @xmath43 follows a power law of the type @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , with @xmath46 the dimension of the system , one obtains the expression of the rate @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are reference constants @xcite .",
    "this expression constitutes the louat ",
    "mulheran  harding ( @xmath50 ) law @xcite proposed heuristically by assuming that the drift is due to surface tension effects , considering only the mean curvature .",
    "the procedure can be generalized to the case in which the gaussian curvature is important which occurs at small sizes of the grains @xcite .",
    "in the offered modeling we would explore another degree of freedom which is @xmath51 , the radius of a molecular cluster or a crystal .",
    "it appears naturally in the modeling being of the form of fokker - planck type @xcite .",
    "a multigrain growth has also been considered as a discretized process in terms of mnet in both space and time domains @xcite .",
    "the model is mesoscopic in the sense that each cell can contain ( i ) a liquid unit of phase @xmath53 , ( ii ) a crystal unit , ( iii ) a small particle embedded in some melt or ( iv ) a solid large particle .",
    "initially , each cell of the lattice contains either a large particle with some probability @xmath54 , or a small particle embedded in some liquid @xmath53 with a probability @xmath55 , or a liquid unit with a probability @xmath56 .",
    "nucleation is induced by simultaneously turning a number @xmath57 of cells into initial solid units , supposed to be randomly dispersed in the initial melt .",
    "since the process occurs over long time scales , thermodynamic ( i.e. equilibrium - like ) quantities can be mapped into multigrain growth probability rules , as follows . at each growth step , all @xmath58 cells containing some liquid phase , i.e. @xmath53-cells and cells with a small particle , in contact with mesoscopic cells are selected .",
    "the probability @xmath59 to grow the phase on the cell @xmath58 is given by a classical thermodynamic argument as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the gain of free energy .",
    "usually , it can be decomposed into two terms : a bulk contribution depending on the driving force and a local surface contribution which is proportional to a chemical bond energy @xmath62 , cf .",
    "eq , ( [ minimum work ] ) .",
    "the algorithm on which the discrete modeling is based , combines a mechanism for pushing and/or trapping of particles , a chemical reaction , and crystal growth kinetics .",
    "the model is an adapted eden model @xcite .",
    "the change in energy enters in the boltzmann factor , cf .",
    "( [ peq general ] ) .",
    "it is considered to be anisotropic and depending on the number of neighbors .",
    "this leads to rugged surfaces and facets .",
    "moreover , interaction with unreactive , or reactive particles has been considered as in the theory of particle trapping or displacement along growing interfaces , elaborated by uhlmann et al . , and called the @xmath63 model @xcite .",
    "the particles are trapped or pushed by the mobile solid / liquid interface depending on ( i ) the surface tensions at solid / liquid and particle / liquid interfaces , ( ii ) the particle ( impurity ) size and ( iii ) the growth velocity of the solidifying front .",
    "( a similarity between the @xmath63 and what we have proposed in sec .",
    "4 has to be noticed , cf .",
    "fig . 3 therein .",
    ") for a fixed particle size ( see , the fse effect involved in the modeling presented in sections 3 and 4 ) , the particles are supposed to be trapped by the front if the growth velocity of the interface is higher than a critical value , a physical situation that suits perfectly our type of modeling .",
    "this critical value is controlled by the particle size and the interfacial tension energies @xcite .",
    "since , while growing the phase in an entropic milieu , the bulk contribution is roughly constant in the system for isothermal conditions , only the local surface contribution is needed for measuring the probability of growth , i.e. @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of nearest - neighboring ( @xmath66 ) units belonging to the same grain and @xmath67 .",
    "this expresses an anisotropic locally preferred kinetic growth along the main directions . for high positive values of @xmath68 , square - like grains",
    "are growing @xcite . for large @xmath68 ,",
    "smooth grain faces are obtained .",
    "> from a kinetic point of view , it is accepted that the grains grow anisotropically with a four - fold symmetry along the @xmath69 planes , the edges of the grains being oriented along the @xmath70 and @xmath71 crystallographic directions . this has been implemented in the choice of the parameter value @xmath68 .    in order to simulate best the chemical reaction process",
    ", the mesoscopic cells for which the nearest and next - nearest neighbors do not contain any particle are excluded from the growth cell selection .",
    "indeed , the growth of the phase on these mesoscopic cells is assumed to be improbable because of the local deficiency of the basic component around these cells .",
    "taking into account the probabilities @xmath59 of all possible growing cells , one specific growth site is randomly selected .",
    "the simulations @xcite put into evidence the effect of the particle ( no matter whether a domestic or testing particle , or some impurity particle ) size distribution itself on the resulting microstructure , which is of special interest of the underlying study .",
    "even though , the mnet - based model considers only two different particle ( impurity ) sizes , the model predicts that the refining of the impurity particles leads to better samples .",
    "it should also be underlined that a discrete mnet - oriented modeling can be thought of as a useful working extension of many of its continuous versions @xcite .",
    "some extension from @xmath52 to @xmath72 is rather straightforward but not too trivial : just as difficult as going in any simulation of eden - type systems when counting sites during spreading must be done with care , see @xcite , and refs .",
    "in this section , we consider two physically relevant cases of the boundary condition ( bc ) prescribed for the growing , e.g. protein ( non  kossel ) , spherical crystal . in the first case , we propose an essential modification of the curvatures contribution to the bc .",
    "this includes the gaussian curvature .",
    "this condition is of equilibrium type . in the second case , we propose `` goldenfeld - type '' condition @xcite which is of nonequilibrium type . in the equilibrium case",
    "we would like to offer a more detailed analysis , whereas in the nonequilibrium case , because the analytic solution to the problem can not be found , we only discuss the asymptotic limit in a brief way .",
    "let us assume that initially at @xmath73 the growing object is an ideal sphere of radius @xmath74 and the density of the sphere is @xmath75 . at time",
    "@xmath76 the radius of the growing sphere is equal to @xmath77 . from the mass conservation law @xcite an evolution equation that gives the speed of the spheroidal crystal formation arises , and looks as follows @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the curvature - dependent surface concentration , and @xmath80 is the velocity of incoming macroions , both taken at distance @xmath51 from the sphere center .",

    "in fact , the latter suits best our type of modeling since it really manifests the fse property due to pronounced sizes of the macromolecules constituting the ( dis)ordered macromolecular cluster . the goal of readily incorporating the fse property into the growth rules governing spheroidal crystal formation has been successfully achieved at both static as well as dynamic level of description - therefore our integrated model is called static - and - dynamic . at the static level of description the goal has been achieved by proposing a modification of the well - known gibbs - thomson ( equilibrium ) formula or by additionally including its nonequilibrium modification that we attributed to goldenfeld , who likely did it for the first time almost twenty years ago but for a diffusive field feeding the growing object @xcite . in this study , however , we have concentrated on the equilibrium bc with the tolman - type correction proposed , emphasizing a pivotal role of the gaussian curvature in the realistic view of the process that we have offered . therefore , the nonequlibrium type bc is dealt with in a rather sketchy or qualitative way , but nevertheless , such a possible modification is worth mentioning , at least for some interesting future task .",

    "4 points to the constrained motion of the macroion to be superdiffusive , with the exponent @xmath204 for an unidimensional approximation offered therein .",
    "thus , and in particular , a specific goal to propose a firm mathematical form for algebraic correlations , somehow underscored in another study @xcite has been achieved too .",

    "planck type descriptions for model crystal growth ( within the integrated picture ) arise .",
    "what above all comes out from the proposed integrated picture , however , is a clear dynamic measure of this integrity , represented by @xmath205 of eq .",
    "( [ diffcoeff ] ) .",
    "it is seen in a picturesque way in fig . 5 which tells us that the process goes naturally in the way that for its final ( mature ) growing stages the overall diffusivity of the system , due to the above mentioned physical factors ( fse , curvature(s ) , fluctuations ) slows down , this way likely promoting order against disorder in the complex entropic milieu from which the object emerges .",
    "also , a difference between gaussian and non - gaussian curvature effects on the diffusive behavior of the system clearly pronounce in the course of time .",
