    "a special type of degeneracy in parameter - dependent resonance spectra , namely `` exceptional points '' @xcite , has recently attracted growing attention theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally @xcite .",
    "exceptional points can be found in systems which depend on at least two real valued parameters .",
    "they are positions in the parameter space at which usually two energy eigenvalues pass through a branch point singularity , i.e. , the two eigenvalues can mathematically be described by two branches of the same analytic function and the exceptional point represents the branch point singularity . in this case , also the eigenvectors , or wave functions , pass through a branch point singularity and , hence , are identical .",
    "the occurrence of a geometric phase @xcite is one of the important consequences of exceptional points @xcite .    within the framework of the linear schrdinger equation ,",
    "the existence of resonances , i.e. , decaying unbound states is important for the appearance of exceptional points because the coalescence of two discrete eigenstates with identical eigenvectors is not possible in the spectra of hermitian hamiltonians with potentials , which describe bound states . here ,",
    "always a set of orthogonal eigenstates , which never can become identical , exists . for resonances",
    ", the situation is different .",
    "their eigenstates can become identical .",
    "one possibility of obtaining the resonances is the complex rotation method @xcite , which leads to _ non_-hermitian hamiltonians in the spectra of which resonances are uncovered as complex eigenvalues .",
    "physical systems in which exceptional points can appear have to depend on at least a two - dimensional parameter space . if exceptional points are to be observable it must be possible to adjust these parameters in a sufficiently wide range of the parameter space .",
    "furthermore , the complex energy eigenvalues , typically the positions ( frequencies or energies ) and widths of resonances , must be accessible with a high precision .",
    "examples are discussed , e.g. , for complex atoms in laser fields @xcite , a double @xmath0 well @xcite , the scattering of a beam of particles by a double barrier potential @xcite , non - hermitian bose - hubbard models @xcite , or models used in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the resonant behavior of atom waves in optical lattices @xcite shows structures originating from exceptional points @xcite , and they can be found in nonlinear quantum systems .",
    "the stationary solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation describing bose - einstein condensates exhibits a coalescence of two states due to the nonlinearity of the equation , which turns out to be a branch point singularity of the energy eigenvalues and wave functions @xcite .",
    "however , the phenomenon of exceptional points in physics is not restricted to quantum mechanics .",
    "acoustic modes in absorptive media @xcite represent a mechanical system , in which branch point singularities appear .",
    "manifestations of exceptional points can also be seen in optical devices @xcite .",
    "the most detailed experimental analysis of exceptional points has been carried out for the resonances of microwave cavities @xcite , which open the possibility of studying the properties of the complex resonance frequencies and the wave functions . in particular ,",
    "the geometric phase has been demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "atoms in static external electric and magnetic fields are fundamental physical systems . as real quantum systems they are accessible both to experimental and theoretical methods and have , e.g. ,",
    "very successfully been used for comparisons with semiclassical theories @xcite .",
    "they provide a rich variety of physical phenomena such as ericson fluctuations , which were discovered both in numerical studies @xcite and experiments @xcite .",
    "recently , the existence of exceptional points was reported and a method to detect them in an experiment with atoms was proposed @xcite .",
    "atoms in external fields are well suited to study the signatures originating from exceptional points in quantum spectra .",
    "the electric and magnetic field strengths span the two - dimensional parameter space required to provide the branch points .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show how exceptional points can be detected systematically in spectra of the hydrogen atom in external fields and to discuss their properties in detail .",
    "numerically exact resonance energies and eigenstates are determined by the complex rotation method @xcite .",
    "the permutation behavior of the resonances for closed parameter space loops is used to unambiguously find and verify the branch point singularities .",
    "examples for exceptional points found in the system are presented .",
    "the shapes of the loops of the complex eigenvalues representing the resonances are explained with a two - dimensional matrix model .",
    "it is shown that single dipole matrix elements of two states coalescing at an exceptional point diverge whereas this behavior does not carry over to the observable photoionization cross section .    besides the typical case , where an exceptional point consists of two resonances forming a square root branch point , higher degeneracies are possible . in this paper",
    "the rare case of a structure with three resonances almost forming a triple - coalescence in the form of a cubic root branch point is presented .",
    "it is shown how exceptional points are related to avoided crossings of the energies or widths of the resonances .",

    "the typical case of an exceptional point is a position in a two - dimensional parameter space at which two eigenvalues pass through a branch point singularity .",
    "this behavior has important consequences for the associated eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "if one encircles the exceptional point in the parameter space , a typical permutation behavior of the eigenvalues can be observed @xcite .",
    "the two eigenvalues which represent the two branches of one analytic function with the singularity are interchanged after one circle around the exceptional point , whereas all further eigenvalues do not undergo a permutation .",
    "away from the exceptional points the branching eigenvalues are different and each of them belongs to a distinct eigenvector .",
    "accordingly , these eigenvectors undergo the same permutation as the eigenvalues , and at the exceptional points they likewise pass through a branch point singularity @xcite , i.e. , there is only one linearly independent eigenvector for the two degenerate eigenvalues . in a matrix representation ,",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors form a normal block @xcite , which distinguishes them from ordinary degeneracies where two eigenvalues belonging to two different analytic functions have the same value . alongside the permutation of the eigenvectors a geometric phase appears . in the most common physical situation of a square root branch point resulting from a complex symmetric matrix ,",
    "the geometric phase becomes manifest in the change in sign of one of the two eigenvectors @xcite and can be written in the form @xmath1 \\overset{\\text{circle}}{\\to } [ \\bm{x}_2 , -\\bm{x}_1 ] \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the eigenvectors permuted during the loop around the exceptional point .",
    "it should be mentioned that the occurrence of the phenomenon is not restricted to two dimensions . in higher - dimensional parameter spaces of complex matrices , an exceptional `` point '' is always an object of co - dimension 2 @xcite .",
    "that is , in two dimensions an exceptional point indeed appears as a point , whereas in three dimensions it is a one - dimensional object , or line , and in a four - dimensional parameter space it has the form of a two - dimensional `` exceptional surface . ''",
    "one of the simplest examples in which an exceptional point occurs , and which helps to understand many effects related to it , is described by the two - dimensional matrix @xcite @xmath4 with the complex parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the two eigenvalues of the matrix are given by @xmath6 and are obviously two branches of the same analytic function in @xmath5 .",
    "there are two exceptional points in the system , which appear at the complex conjugate values @xmath7 as can easily be seen . the eigenvectors which belong to the two eigenvalues are @xmath8 they also depend on the parameter @xmath5 and pass through a branch point singularity at the exceptional points @xmath7 , where the only linearly independent eigenvector reads @xmath9 .",
    "the branch point singularity leads to a characteristic behavior of the corresponding eigenvalues under changes of the parameters . if one chooses a closed loop in the parameter space and calculates the eigenvalues for a set of parameters on this loop , the permutation of the eigenvalues can be seen by plotting their paths in the complex energy plane",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",

    "after one revolution , the first eigenvalue marked by red squares has traveled to the starting point of the second marked by green diamonds , and vice versa . as a consequence",
    ", the path of each eigenvalue is not closed if one traversal of the loop in the parameter space is performed , but the path is closed if the parameter space loop is traversed twice .",
    "of course , for the simple model it is also possible to demonstrate the half - circle structure analytically .",
    "if the parameter space curve described above is applied to the eigenvalues one obtains , for @xmath16 , the expansion @xmath17 or @xmath18 which reproduces the half - circles shown in fig.[fig : ep_most_simple_model ] for a full parameter space loop @xmath19 correctly .",

    "the hamiltonian contains the coulomb potential @xmath26 , the paramagnetic term @xmath27 , the diamagnetic term @xmath28 , and the potential due to the external electric field @xmath29 .    for the numerical calculation of the energy eigenvalues in a matrix representation of the hamiltonian it is advantageous to transform the schrdinger equation into dilated",

    "the hamiltonian has two constants of motion , namely the energy and the parity with respect to the @xmath52-plane .",
    "the latter symmetry opens the possibility of classifying eigenstates by their @xmath21-parity and to consider the associated subspaces separately .",
    "the examples discussed in this paper are given for even @xmath21-parity .",
    "the computation of the eigenvalues was performed using the arpack library @xcite . for typical calculations ,",
    "the number of basis states was on the order of @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "the exact determination of the positions of exceptional points up to four valid digits often required larger matrices with up to @xmath55 states . if the matrices @xmath56 and @xmath49 are built up appropriately , they possess a band structure , which was exploited in the numerical diagonalizations .",
    "the hamiltonian in the schrdinger equation is non - hermitian . two parameters , viz .  the strengths of the external electric and magnetic fields , are available to influence the positions of the resonances and thus it should be possible to produce degeneracies of the complex resonance energies .",
    "exceptional points do exist in atomic spectra if the fields can be chosen in such a way that a coalescence of two states occurs .",
    "the crossed - fields hydrogen system fulfills all necessary conditions for the appearance of exceptional points , however , one has to find them in the spectrum to really prove their existence .",
    "a successful procedure to search exceptional points can be found if one exploits their properties .",
    "the permutation of the two eigenvalues involved in the singularity provides a clear signature which can be used to detect exceptional points .",
    "a good choice for a closed loop is a `` circle '' in the parameter space of the two field strengths with a radius @xmath57 chosen relative to a center @xmath58 , @xmath59 it opens the possibility of scanning a larger area of the parameter space , namely the complete circular area , at once .",
    "a fundamental advantage of the method is that it allows for automatizing the procedure up to a certain extent .",
    "if the steps on the circle are chosen small enough , the resonances of two consecutive steps can be assigned to each other unambiguously , and their motion in the complex energy plane can be traced .",
    "eigenvalues which do not return to their starting point once the circle in parameter space is closed but are interchanged with a further resonance are a proof for the existence of an exceptional point .",
    "the exact position of the degeneracy can be determined by minimizing the distance of the two eigenvalues .",
    "after the degeneracy has been found numerically , a last circle with a small radius ( typically @xmath60 ) around the parameter point at which the degeneracy occurs is used to decide whether or not the branch point singularity structure is present and the degeneracy found is an exceptional point .",
    "the geometric phase appearing with exceptional points is accessible through the eigenvectors representing the resonances in the numerical calculations , and provides a further possibility of verifying their existence @xcite . as was also shown in ref .",
