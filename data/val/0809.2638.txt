    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ; see @xcite for a recent review ) have been recognized as being enigmatic x - ray pulsars , for which none of characteristics of binary companions have been detected @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observed x - ray luminosity of axps ( @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 ) can not be explained by the accretion of matter from companions , as is the case for binary x - ray pulsars .",
    "the spin periods of axps ( @xmath9 ) are concentrated in a narrow range ( 2@xmath1012 s5408 @xcite . ] ) and the spin - down rates ( @xmath11 ) are distributed in the range @xmath12 ",
    "@xmath13 s s@xmath8 . the rate of the spin - down energy loss of neutron stars ( @xmath14 erg s@xmath8 , where @xmath15 g @xmath16 is the moment of inertia of a neutron star ) is too small to maintain the x - ray luminosity , suggesting that they are not rotation - powered pulsars .",
    "two competing models have been proposed for the energy source : accretion from a fossil disk and decay of ultra - strong magnetic fields . in the former scenario ,",
    "the fossil disks are thought to be produced through a fall - back of matter after a supernova explosion @xcite or as a remnant of the common - envelope phase in the evolution of a binary @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the fossil disk model is that it naturally explains the narrow range of the concentration of the spin periods through the propeller phase in the spin evolution @xcite . in the latter scenario axps",
    "are magnetars , which are strongly magnetized neutron stars with emissions powered by the dissipation of magnetic energy @xcite . assuming that their spins are braked by magnetic dipole radiation , a strong magnetic field of @xmath17  @xmath18 g at their surface is implied .",
    "axps are similar to soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) , which are thought to be magnetars ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "the observation of sgr - like bursts in axps suggests the unification of axps and sgrs by the magnetar scenario @xcite .",
    "4u 0142 + 61 is a typical object among axps .",
    "it is the nearest and least absorbed object among axps and sgrs and is hence the most intensively observed of these objects in multi - wavelength studies .",
    "the optical counterpart of this object was discovered by @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered the optical pulsation .",
    "the pulsed fraction of @xmath19% was found to be larger than that of soft x - rays , suggesting that the optical pulsation can not be explained by thermal reprocessing of a disk illuminated by x - rays .",
    "@xcite also measured the optical pulsation in a @xmath3 band and obtained a consistent pulsed fraction of @xmath20% .",
    "we showed that the near - infrared / optical spectrum consists of two components , near - infrared excess and optical pulsating components , by first near - simultaneous multi - band photometry @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered the mid - infrared emission with spitzer , and showed that the near - infrared excess component extends to the mid - infrared region .",
    "they proposed that the infrared excess component can be modeled by a dust disk around a neutron star , where the spectrum is similar to that of the dust disk of a proto - planetary system .",
    "their model is different from the original fossil disk model , in that the disk does not power the x - ray emission . in their model ,",
    "the flux of the @xmath21 band is mainly composed of the dust disk component .",
    "therefore , the pulsed flux of the @xmath21 band is expected to be small .",
    "@xcite collected data spanning seven years and showed that the near - infrared / optical flux and the spectral shape are variable .",
    "the correlations between the x - ray total / pulsed fluxes and the near - infrared / optical fluxes were uncertain , although these correlations are expected for a fossil disk .",
    "therefore , they suggested that the near - infrared flux is composed of components other than the disk component .",
    "as described above , the origin of the infrared emission is not yet clear .",
    "some authors have proposed theoretical models for the optical / infrared emission of axps , based on the magnetar scenario or fossil disk scenario . in the former scenario ,",
    "@xcite applied mechanisms of coherent radio emission of rotation - powered pulsars to a magnetar , where the emission frequency is boosted to the infrared , optical , or even uv region by the strong magnetic field of the magnetar .",
    "@xcite proposed an exotic quantum electrodynamics model for the broad - band emission of magnetars .",
    "@xcite applied the outer gap model of rotation - powered gamma - ray pulsars on magnetars . in the latter scenario , @xcite discussed the optical / infrared spectrum generated by an irradiated fall - back disk and found that the sizes of the inner and outer radii of the disk become implausible .",
    "in addition , hybrid models of both scenarios have also been proposed .",
    "@xcite showed that the pulsed optical emission can be explained by the disk - star dynamo gap model , where the fossil disk plays a key role in the emission mechanism .",
    "@xcite showed that an irradiated and viscously heated disk model can account for the observed infrared / optical spectrum of both pulsed and un - pulsed components , by magnetospheric optical emission @xcite and disk emission , respectively .    in any of the above models ,",
    "the origin of the emission can be clearly determined by the pulsation .",
    "the emission from the co - rotating magnetosphere must be pulsed , while that from the disk is unlikely to be pulsed . in this paper",
    ", we report a search for the pulsation of the axp 4u 0142 + 61 in the @xmath0 band , using the fast - readout mode of ircs mounted on the subaru 8.2-m telescope .",
    "this is the first search for the pulsation in the infrared band .    in the following",
    ", the dereddened spectrum of 4u 0142 + 61 is obtained using the interstellar extinction of @xmath22 , which was determined by using red clump stars @xcite .",
    "we observed the axp 4u 0142 + 61 in the @xmath0 band ( mko - nir photometric system ; @xcite ) on 2004 july 31 ( ut ) , using ircs ( infrared camera and spectrograph)@xcite mounted on the cassegrain focus of the subaru telescope @xcite on top of mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the weather condition was photometric with an excellent seeing ( @xmath23 at the @xmath0 band ) through the observing . in the mko - nir photometric system ,",
    "the effective wavelength and band width of the @xmath0 band are @xmath1 @xmath2 m and @xmath24 @xmath2 m ( fwhm ) , respectively @xcite . to search for pulsation of the axp , we used ircs in the _ movie mode_.    in this mode , we successively took 0.84-s exposure frames , corresponding to about 1/10 of the pulse period of the axp ( 8.7 s ) . to reduce the overhead time for array readout and data recording , we restricted the readout region to the central sub - array of @xmath25 pixels , which corresponds to 1/8 of the @xmath26 pixels of the full image .",
    "we used a pixel scale of 58 mas per pixel , and hence the @xmath25-pixel region corresponded to a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath27 .",
    "we observed the axp by two - point dithering .",
    "we arranged the fov of ircs so that at least one of two bright stars near the axp ( 109 and 115 listed in @xcite ) were included in the fovs of both observation directions .",
    "we call one of the two directions , for which star 109 and the axp were included in the fov , the `` a direction , '' and we call the other , for which stars 115 and 109 and the axp were included in the fov , the `` b direction . ''",
    "these stars were bright enough to be seen in all frames .",
    "we successively took 300 frames for each direction , saved into a fits file of cube structure , called a `` data - cube '' , and recorded the instantaneous time of each frame .",
    "the observation directions were changed in the order a , a , b , b , a , a ,  .",

    "the precise pulse frequency of 4u 0142 + 61 has been measured with rxte over a period of ten years @xcite .",
    "the period of our subaru observation is included in this interval .",
    "the pulse frequency of this axp at the start of our subaru observation was 0.1150934471(15 ) hz , where the number in parentheses is the 1@xmath28 uncertainty . here",
    ", we used the `` postgap ephemeris spanning cycle 510 '' in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "we searched for pulsation in our subaru data near this pulse frequency by the epoch folding method from 0.113601 hz to 0.116601 hz in steps of 0.00001 hz . the range and step were sufficiently wide and fine , respectively , because the fourier resolution of the pulse frequency was @xmath29 hz , where @xmath30 is the observation span ( table [ tab : obs summary ] ) .",
    "since the pulse period of the axp is long ( 8.7 s ) and the duration of the observation was short ( 2.4 hours ) , the only significant effect of the doppler shift due to the motion of observer was that due to the orbital motion of the earth , estimated to be @xmath31 hz .",
    "this is small in comparison with the fourier resolution .",
    "thus , barycentric correction of the arrival times of photons was not necessary in our observation .",
    "we analysed the data with the iraf software packages .",
    "we decomposed the data - cubes of the a and b directions into normal fits images , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the first image of each data - cube was excluded , because its quality was poor owing to bias instability .",
    "we produced @xmath35 images ( @xmath36 ) , by subtracting a frame of the b direction from a frame of the a direction . by this process",
    ", the sky background and the dark level were canceled .",
    "the pair of data - cubes were selected with as small an interval between the directions as possible to cancel the sky background properly .",
    "subtraction between frames of the same index @xmath37 was necessary to cancel the sequencing variation of the bias .",
    "@xmath38 images were also produced in the same way .",
    "flat fielding was performed for the @xmath35 and @xmath38 images using a mean - combined flat frame taken by irradiation of a calibration lamp .",
    "we sorted the flat - fielded images into eight phases of a tentative pulse period of the axp , according to the instantaneous times at their exposures . for each phase",
    ", we shifted and combined the flat - fielded images by masking the bad pixels .",
    "the map of the bad pixels was made from the dark and flat frames , for which we selected pixels with extraordinary adu counts .",
    "the number of pixels for the image - shift was calculated by measuring the center position of the point spread function of the two bright stars ( 109 and 115 ; see section [ section : observation ] ) .",
    "we measured the flux ( adu ) of the axp of each phase using the standard iraf photometry package ( phot ) .",
    "for the aperture , we set the radii from 1 pixel ( 0@xmath39.058 ) to 15 pixels ( 0@xmath39.87 ) in steps of 1 pixel .",
    "for the background region , we set a concentric annulus with radii of the inner and outer boundaries of 15 and 25 pixels ( 1@xmath39.45 ) .",
    "the systematic error of the flux was estimated by photometry for 11 areas of blank sky for the same aperture and background annulus as the area of the axp . in the following",
    ", we applied an aperture radius of 4 pixels ( 0.@xmath3923 ) . for an aperture radius of around 4 pixels , the signal - to - noise ratio of the flux within the aperture to the systematic error obtained as above became maximum for a phase - averaged image ( figure [ fig : 4u+mark_08030300_crop3.eps ] ) .",
    "we produced a pulse profile with eight phase bins , and calculated the reduced @xmath40 values for the profile by the best fit constant model .",
    "the reduced @xmath40 value represents the signal of the pulsation of the axp .",
    "figure [ fig : periodgram_4u_pulse_v7.0_paper.ps ] shows the signal versus the pulse frequency",
    ". we could not detect any significant signal of pulsation of the axp at the expected pulse frequency in any aperture radius setting .",
    "in addition , we tried a similar pulse search by relative photometry with reference to the flux of stars 109 or 106 listed in @xcite ( figure [ fig : 4u+mark_08030300_crop3.eps ] ) . for star 109 , the values in a plot corresponding to figure [ fig : periodgram_4u_pulse_v7.0_paper.ps ] was larger than that obtained by the simple photometry above .",
    "it is thought that there is an adverse influence of the dimple of star 115 close to star 109 .",
    "in contrast , for star 106 the reduced @xmath40 values were slightly smaller , indicating a slight improvement of the photometry .",
    "since this improvement was small , we decided to apply simple photometry rather than relative photometry with reference to star 106 .",

    "the infrared pulse profile of 4u 0142 + 61 is unknown .",
    "then , at first we calculated an upper limit of the pulse fraction by the root - mean - square pulse fraction @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 are the flux of 4u 0142 + 61 of the @xmath37-th phase bin and the mean of @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "we produced a histogram of @xmath45 of a pulse profile for the searched pulse frequencies , and hence the @xmath46% c.l .",
    "upper limit was obtained from the distribution of the histogram .",
    "we followed this calculation for each aperture radius , and the least upper limit was obtained at an aperture radius of 5 pixels ( 0.@xmath47 ) .",
    "the 90% c.l .",
    "upper limit of the pulse fraction was 17% . assuming the pulse profile , the tighter upper limit can be obtained . because of the non - detection of the infrared pulsation , an assumption of a sinusoidal shape is generally acceptable . for 4u 0142 + 61 ,",
    "both single - peaked and double - peaked shapes are plausible .",
    "for example , the optical pulse profile shown in @xcite is a double - peaked shape , while that shown in @xcite looks like a single - peaked shape .",
    "then , we fitted the pulse profile by a sine curve with three free parameters ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) , @xmath51\\ ] ] or @xmath52\\ ] ] with the @xmath40 fitting method for each pulse frequency and each aperture radius . here , @xmath53 is the pulse phase between 0 and 1 .",
    "we followed the same method as that described in @xmath45 for the calculation of the @xmath46% c.l .",
    "upper limit of the @xmath48 .",
    "the least 90% c.l .",
    "upper limit of the pulse fraction was both 16% at aperture radii of 5 pixels and 3 pixels ( 0.@xmath3917 ) , respectively .",
    "eventually , the resultant upper limit of the pulse fraction is 17% ( 90%c.l . ) by selecting a conservative value .      the phase - averaged flux of 4u 0142 + 61 was obtained by relative photometry of an image made by combining all the images of the movie mode ( figure [ fig : 4u+mark_08030300_crop3.eps ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of the axp was measured with reference to the magnitude of star 106 listed in @xcite . the aperture radius and the radii of the inner and outer boundaries of the concentric annulus for the background",
    "were set to 4 , 15 and 25 pixels , respectively .",
    "the systematic error for the flux was estimated as described in subsection [ subsection : search pulse ] .",
    "the resultant magnitude of the axp was @xmath54 , where the last error is the zero - point uncertainty inherited from the catalog @xcite .",
    "to discuss the emission mechanism of the axp , we generated the spectral energy distribution ( @xmath55 ) of 4u 0142 + 61 for the phase - averaged fluxes and pulsed fluxes ( figure [ fig : 4u_nufnu_av3.5+pulse.ps ] ) , using all the published data ( see caption of figure [ fig : 4u_nufnu_av3.5+pulse.ps ] ) and the @xmath0 band fluxes obtained in this work .",
    "for the subaru observation on sep .",
    "2003 @xcite , we analysed the data in our own way and obtained different results from that shown in @xcite .",
    "we will present the details of the photometry in our companion paper @xcite . in the phase - averaged spectrum , a peak at the @xmath56 band",
    "is clearly seen .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this feature may be a proton cyclotron feature .",
    "although other cyclotron features in other bands are expected , they are not yet clear .",
    "further simultaneous multi - band observations are necessary , because the spectrum is variable .    to understand the emission mechanism of the pulse component , we calculated the slope of the spectral shape .",
    "combined with the pulsed flux of the @xmath0 band ( this work ; @xmath45 ) and that of the @xmath3 band @xcite , the slope of the pulsed component ( @xmath4 ) was found to be constrained to @xmath5 ( 90% c.l . ) for the interstellar extinction of @xmath57 . because the constraint on the slope of the pulsed flux is not so stringent , any emission mechanisms are still allowed for the pulse component .",
    "for example , the rayleigh - jeans tail of the blackbody is @xmath58 and synchrotron self - absorption is @xmath59 . in the quantum electrodynamics model of @xcite , @xmath60 for the optical - infrared region . in the disk - star dynamo gap model of @xcite , @xmath61 ; while in the magnetar model by the same authors , @xmath62 is slightly smaller than @xmath63 . in the curvature - drift - induced maser mechanism proposed by @xcite ,",
    "the maser frequency of 4u 0142 + 61 is about @xmath64 hz , which is near the @xmath21 band .",
    "then , the maser amplification ratio equating to the pulse fraction in their model is maximum near the @xmath21 band .",
    "since the upper limit for the pulse fraction of the @xmath0 band is similar to the pulse fraction of the @xmath3 band , this model is a possible mechanism .",
    "the @xmath56 band peak in the phase - averaged spectrum may be the maser frequency peak of this emission mechanism .",
    "if so , then a larger pulse fraction at the @xmath56 band is expected .      in the near future",
    ", we can make use of the adaptive optics ( ao ) technique for the sensitive detection of the axp . the subaru telescope plans to install an upgraded 188-element ao system with a laser guide star @xcite . using this technique",
    ", we will be able to constrain the pulse fraction to @xmath65 and constrain the spectral slope of the pulsed component to @xmath66 for a feasible observation time .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath21 band flux varies about 40% over the time scale of years and hence it is possible that the @xmath21 band pulsation would grow above the detection limit .",
    "further monitoring of the infrared pulsation should prove interesting .",
