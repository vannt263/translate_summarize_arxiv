    "our only existing experimental clues about the theory that lies beyond the standard model are the apparently arbitrary fundamental parameters of the standard model . the only experiments guaranteed to determine the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and thus new clues into beyond the standard model physics were to have been performed at the ssc .",
    "the fundamental parameters of the standard model may prove to be our only window onto beyond the standard model physics for some time , unless we get lucky with a lower energy accelerator .",
    "the nonperturbative calculations which allow the extraction of these parameters from experiment will therefore take on increasing importance over the next few years .",
    "the last few years have seen significant progress in some of these calculations with lattice qcd .",
    "some of the simplest ones have now been completed with first attempts at quantitative estimation of all uncertainties .",
    "lattice calculations of the mass of the @xmath1 quark , @xmath2 , and the kaon @xmath0 parameter , @xmath3 , are now believed by their authors to be more accurate than the best conventional phenomenological determinations of these quantities .",
    "determinations of the strong coupling constant , @xmath4 , are now of comparable quality to the best conventional determinations and will soon be significantly better .",
    "many other calculations crucial to standard model phenomenology are undergoing rapid development .",
    "the foundations of the current advances were laid around 1980 with the development of explicit expressions for hadron masses and other hadronic quantities by weingarten and by parisi and their collaborators .",
    "@xcite the recent developments have arisen in part because of dramatic developments in machine and algorithmic technology that will not be reviewed here .",
    "@xcite the computers on which these calculations have been performed are around 10,000 times as powerful as the vaxes on which the first hadron spectrum calculations were performed around 1980 .",
    "likewise , the speeds of algorithms for the inclusion of sea quark loops from first principles ( algorithms for `` unquenched '' calculations ) have increased by an even larger factor , one which is hard to measure because of the extreme slowness of the original algorithms.numerous other methodological and technical improvements have also contributed to the reliability of the calculations .",
    "these developments have occurred also because of an improved perspective regarding which lattice calculations are easiest to perform reliably , and are most useful to particle physics .",
    "although the desire to understand the physics of nuclear energy levels was the initial spur to the study of strong interactions , the calculation of the energy levels of the uranium nucleus is not currently seen as the most promising test of qcd , or of standard model or beyond the standard model physics .",
    "likewise , although the ability to calculate the proton mass from first principles seemed like a holy grail when lattice gauge theory was invented 20 years ago , the mass of the proton and the rest of the light hadron spectrum is not the only or even the most important application of lattice gauge theory .",
    "the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath0 , and the quarkonia ( the @xmath8 s and @xmath9 s ) are significantly simpler than the proton and other hadrons , as will be discussed",
    ". they will provide good tests of lattice methods and significant information about the standard model before calculations of the proton mass do .",
    "the simplest hadrons to investigate on the lattice are the @xmath8 and @xmath9 systems .",
    "quarkonia are smaller than most hadrons , resulting in smaller finite volume errors .",
    "propagators for heavy quarks can be calculated much more rapidly than light quark propagators , and no extrapolation down to the physical quark mass is required as it is for light quarks .",
    "these facts have been particularly emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "quarkonia have received relatively little attention from lattice theorists until recently .",
    "the reason may be that they have been well understood for a long time on the basis of nonrelativistic potential models @xcite , which become rigorous predictions of qcd in a well - defined limit , @xmath10 .",
    "this fact should , to the contrary , place them among the most interesting and important of current lattice calculations because of the possibility of using nonrelativistic methods and reasoning to :    * guide physics expectations , and * monitor the accuracy of approximations ( finite lattice spacing @xmath11 , finite volume @xmath12 , quenched ) and make corrections .",
    "for example , the nonrelativistic picture tells us that the hyperfine splitting in quarkonia is a short distance quantity , sensitive to @xmath13 , the dimension five operator which is the leading operator which must be added to the action to correct for finite lattice spacing errors . this quantity is useful in testing and fine tuning the approximations used in lattice calculations . a spin - averaged quantity like the 1p1s splitting should be insensitive to these leading finite lattice spacing errors .",
    "it is also insensitive to the precise value of the quark mass used , since it is almost the same for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 systems .",
    "it is a likely candidate to yield information about particle physics , as in the extraction of the strong coupling constant , to be discussed below .",
    "= 3 in    the most extensive investigation of finite lattice spacing errors which has yet been performed in a phenomenological calculation has recently been completed by the nrqcd collaboration for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 systems .",
    "they use the formalism of nonrelativistic qcd @xcite , a discretized version of the nonrelativistic expansion of the quark action . in previous work",
    "reported in ref.@xcite , coefficients of operators for finite lattice spacing and nonrelativistic corrections were evaluated at tree level .",
    "corrections were then determined by evaluating the operator expectation values in potential model wave functions .",
    "this year , these expected corrections were verified from first principles by including the required operators directly in the lattice calculations , with coefficients evaluated to one loop .",
    "@xcite the resulting spectrum for the @xmath9 is shown in fig .",
    "[ upspec ] .",
    "the mass of the @xmath9 was used as an input ( to fix the quark mass ) , and the overall energy scale ( the lattice spacing in physical units ) was chosen to obtaining the best fit to the remaining masses .    =    fig .",
    "[ upwf ] shows the coulomb gauge wave function , calculated on a @xmath14 lattice with wilson fermions .",
    "@xcite unlike a qed - like pure coulomb potential which would produce a wave function with the form @xmath15 , qcd produces nonrelativistic bound states with wave functions that fall more slowly at short distances ( smaller effective @xmath16 at short distances ) and faster at long distances ( as expected from confinement ) .",
    "this wave function was calculated in the quenched approximation , which has slightly too much asymptotic freedom due to the absence of light quark loops .",
    "it would not be surprising to find that the same calculations repeated in the full theory showed slightly less concavity in the wave function , perhaps of order 20% less ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the effects of finite boundary conditions can be seen half way across the lattice , at @xmath18 in lattice units",
    ".      calculations involving light quarks are significantly more difficult than those with only heavy quarks .",
    "one can not estimate as accurately in advance what order of correction operators must be added to the action to achieve a certain accuracy in finite lattice spacing errors , or what volume must be used to reduce finite volume errors to a negligible level .",
    "these things must be determined to a much greater degree by painstaking experimentation .",
    "light quark propagators are much more costly computationally .",
    "effects of light quark loops are likely to be more complicated than for quarkonia .    current algorithms for calculating light quark algorithms fail when the light quark mass @xmath19 is reduced toward its physical value .",
    "the extrapolation is likely to be reasonably straightforward for such quantities as @xmath20 and @xmath21 whose chiral behavior is well understood .",
    "the masses of particles like the @xmath22 which become unstable in the small @xmath23 , large @xmath12 limit clearly require special care in extrapolating to @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite ( the correlation functions from which @xmath25 is determined become dominated by the two pion cut , rather than the @xmath22 pole in the physical limit . ) the proton mass is also known to have much larger nonlinear corrections in chiral perturbation theory than @xmath20 and @xmath21 do when @xmath26 is raised above @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite analogous effects in @xmath28 occur in the quenched approximation with different coefficients .",
    "in addition , there are indications in quenched chiral perturbation theory calculations of pathologies as @xmath24 , which so far have not been reconciled with numerical results . @xcite    =    the most systematic attempt so far at calculating the hadron spectrum in the quenched approximation appeared this year from the gf11 collaboration .",
    "@xcite the calculation was performed at several values each of lattice spacing , volume , and quark mass , with the results extrapolated to the physical values of each . the resulting spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 have been used as inputs to set the quark masses .",
    "the error bars include statistics , finite volume , and @xmath24 extrapolations ( assuming linear behavior in @xmath26 ) .",
    "they do not include uncertainties due the finite lattice spacing extrapolation and to the quenched approximation .",
    "the dominant finite lattice spacing errors can be removed by adding a single correction operator to the action . a calculation with a tree level improved @xmath31 corrected action has been performed at a single small lattice spacing , with results that appear to be consistent with these extrapolated results ( though with larger statistical errors ) .",
    "@xcite    adding light quark loops to the calculation is much more expensive .",
    "the state of uncertainty analysis is therefore somewhat less advanced than for the quenched theory .",
    "even more than for quenched calculations , algorithms begin to fail as the quark mass is reduced .",
    "the light quark mass can be reduced only to around @xmath32 ; results must then be extrapolated to the physical limit .",
    "[ fig : fpi ] shows an unquenched calculation of @xmath21 @xcite , which may be the simplest light hadron quantity to obtain other than the pion mass .",
    "chiral perturbation theory leads us to expect it to have a small and smooth extrapolation to the chiral limit , compared with @xmath25 and @xmath28 .",
    "the calculation used two light flavors of quarks in the sea , the lattice quark masses of 0.02 and 0.01 correspond roughly to @xmath27 and @xmath33 .",
    "the size of the extrapolation from @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is consistent with expectations based on the experimental value of @xmath36 .",
    "some sources of error have been carefully checked : consistency between values of @xmath21 obtained from various operators has been tested , the effects of finite volume on @xmath29 have been tested to be under 1% ( finite volume effects on @xmath25 and @xmath28 are much larger ) . yet to be checked are the effects of finite volume on @xmath21 itself , the agreement of @xmath21 as a function of @xmath26 with chiral perturbation theory , and the effects of finite lattice spacing .    the algorithmic restriction to unphysically large light quark masses seems likely to be with us for a while .",
    "as the various sources of uncertainty in unquenched calculations gradually become better understood , one of the important questions for consumers of lattice calculations will become : which quantities have the smoothest and best understood extrapolations from @xmath37 down to the physical light mass limit ?      from the standpoint of standard model physics , one of the most crucial results of hadron spectrum calculations is the determination of the fundamental parameters of qcd : the strong coupling constant , @xmath4 , and the quark masses .",
    "such calculations have two elements .",
    "first , one calculates a measurable dimensionful quantity such as @xmath21 or a level splitting in the @xmath8 or @xmath9 system , to set the lattice energy scale in physical units .",
    "this appears to be the least important source of uncertainty in such calculations .",
    "second , one determines the physical coupling at short distances .",
    "this may be done either by a ) relating the bare lattice parameter to a conventional definition ( @xmath38 , for example ) via renormalization group improved , mean field improved perturbation theory , or better still , by b ) ignoring the bare lattice parameters ( which are often somewhat pathological compared with physically defined parameters ) and extracting the physical parameters nonperturbatively from short distance lattice calculations .",
    "if the calculations are done in the quenched approximation , one must also estimate the associated corrections and uncertainties .",
    "the expected effects in the @xmath9 meson are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ups ] omission of quark loops from the theory results in too large a @xmath39 function .",
    "if parameters are set by adjusting middle distance physics such as the 1p-1s splitting to be right , the coupling constant at short distances will be slightly too small , as illustrated in the left hand figure .",
    "the size of the effect may be estimated with the aid of potential models in advance of including sea quarks from first principles .",
    "very roughly , the expected size of the effect is of order @xmath40 .",
    "the `` running mass '' of the @xmath1 quark , on the other hand , does not run for @xmath41 . the effective mass determined at the lattice spacing scale",
    "is the same mass governing the dynamics at the much lower scale of @xmath9 physics , whether or not the effects of light quark loops are included .",
    "this fact makes @xmath2 the most reliably known of the parameters of qcd .",
    "the light quark masses are more difficult , since we have no way of reliably estimating the effects of quark loops without including them from first principles .      to obtain the the lattice scale in physical units for use in a lattice determination of the strong coupling constant , spin - averaged level splittings in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 systems are particularly useful quantities , for reasons already discussed .",
    "uncertainties arising from usual lattice errors such as finite @xmath12 , finite @xmath11 , and statistics are quite small and seem to be under very good control .",
    "the dominant uncertainties in @xmath4 determinations are arise from perturbation theory , and , for the present , the quenched approximation .",
    "there are very large perturbative one loop corrections in the relation between the bare lattice coupling constant and physically defined coupling constants . these , however , are no more significant than the large corrections in the relation between the @xmath42 and @xmath38 couplings .",
    "@xcite the most sensible expansion parameter need not be the one which is simplest in terms of the regulator : it must be determined from physical quantities . the bare coupling constants may be rather pathological expansion parameters .",
    "the origin of the large corrections can also be understood : they arise from tadpoles due to higher dimension operators in the wilson lattice action . if such effects are taken into account with mean field theory estimates , a large number of perturbative series for pure gauge theory , wilson fermions , and nrqcd become very convergent .",
    "mean field theory improvement may also be used be used to estimate higher order uncalculated terms in lattice perturbation theory .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a mean field improved perturbation theory was used to extract the renormalized coupling from the bare lattice coupling .",
    "subsequent nonperturbative extractions of @xmath4 from a variety of lattice quantities yielded results which were systematically a few per cent higher than the coupling obtained through the mean field improved relation with the bare coupling .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite . ) this has resulted in a small but significant increase in the present values of @xmath4 over those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the largest source of uncertainty in current determinations of @xmath4 , and the one under poorest control is the use of potential models and perturbation theory to estimate the effects of light quark loops on the results .",
    "it is clear that the quenched theory , with too strong a @xmath39 function , ought to have too weak an @xmath4 at short distances . for the @xmath9 system , potential models and ordinary perturbation theory yield similar estimates for the increase in the running for the quenched theory between the scale of @xmath9 physics and the cutoff scale .",
    "( potential models suggest 6001100 mev for typical gluon momentum transfers in the @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite ) the agreement of the much more sensitive correction for the @xmath8 system provides some check on the consistency of the analysis .",
    "the first checks of these estimates from first principles have now appeared .",
    "@xcite . with large errors ,",
    "the results so far are consistent with the quenched analysis .",
    "the preliminary results for the latest analyses of @xmath4 determined in the quenched approximation @xcite are consistent with @xmath43      since the effective mass of fermions does not run at energy scales below the pole mass , determinations of @xmath44 and @xmath2 do not suffer from the largest effect due to the quenched approximation in the determinations of @xmath4 and @xmath26 : the running of the effective coupling or mass between the physics scale and the short distance scale at which the coupling is determined .",
    "the nrqcd collaboration has determined @xmath2 in two independent ways , with compatible results . in method 1 , one calculates the binding energy , the difference between the bare quark masses and the physical mass of the @xmath9 .",
    "this lattice result is then subtracted from the experimental mass of the @xmath9 to obtain @xmath45 . in method 2 , one determines the coefficient @xmath46 required in the quark s kinetic energy to obtain the correct energy ",
    "momentum relation for the @xmath9 .",
    "the largest uncertainty in each case arises from perturbation theory , estimated at 12% for method 1 , and 23% for method 2 .",
    "uncertainties arising from finite lattice spacing , finite volume , and statistics are estimated to be 1% or less .",
    "the result for the pole mass is @xmath47 using @xcite @xmath48 and @xmath49 one obtains @xmath50 for the @xmath1 quark .",
    "the mass of the @xmath51 quark will soon be reported based on these same methods .",
    "it will be relatively less accurate then @xmath2 because the errors arising from an additive mass renormalization are larger relative to @xmath44 then to @xmath2 , and because the required perturbation theory is less accurate at @xmath8 energy scales ( under 700 mev , according to potential models ) then at @xmath9 energy scales ( under 600 - 1100 mev ) .",
    "the @xmath52 quark is expected to decay before it forms qcd bound states .",
    "lattice methods are unlikely to contribute to determining its mass .",
    "the light quark masses are the most difficult of the fundamental parameters of qcd to determine .",
    "there is certainly significant running of the quark masses between the lattice spacing scale and the scale of light hadron physics .",
    "however , there is no hope of estimating the effects of light quark loops on this running at large distances : unquenched calculations are required from the start .",
    "however , @xmath20 , the obvious choice to determine @xmath26 , is by far the easiest of the light hadron masses to determine , so this calculation is likely to be among the first to performed reliably in unquenched calculations .",
    "the current status of determinations of @xmath26 in the @xmath38 scheme is summarized in fig .",
    "[ figmq ] @xcite .",
    "calculations have been performed with wilson fermions and staggered ( ks , or kogut - susskind ) fermions , in the quenched approximation ( @xmath53 ) and with two flavors of light quarks ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the calculations employing staggered fermions are nicely independent of the lattice spacing , while those using wilson fermions show significant variation , seeming to approach the staggered results as the lattice spacing is reduced .",
    "( this may be related to the fact that the lattice spacing errors in the quark propagators start at @xmath31 for wilson fermions and @xmath55 for staggered . )",
    "this is a pity , because the perturbation theory for the relation between the bare staggered fermion mass and the @xmath38 mass is much worse behaved than the analogous perturbation theory wilson fermions or nrqcd .",
    "there is roughly a 40% effect in this relation which has not been understood in terms of either renormalization group logarithms or mean field theory tadpoles .",
    "current results from staggered fermions ( @xmath56 mev ) are at the low end of the conventional range , but it is not known yet how reliable these are .",
    "there are thus several ways in which the determination of the light quark masses is more difficult than the determination of @xmath4 and the heavy quark masses : unquenched calculations are required from the start , the perturbation theory is less well understood , and nonperturbative techniques for extracting the short distance quark mass are less well developed . on the other hand , @xmath26 is known from existing phenomenology to within only a factor of three ( as opposed to 520% for the other quantities ) so the payoff will ultimately be bigger .",
    "as long as it is the case that the only clues available to us about the theory lying behind the standard model are the apparently arbitrary `` fundamental '' parameters of the model , one of the most important applications of lattice gauge theory will be the calculations of the hadronic weak matrix elements that allow the extraction of the elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - moskawa matrix elements from hadron decay data .",
    "the hadronic matrix elements for extracting @xmath57 and @xmath58 can be estimated with sufficient accuracy by employing @xmath59 and @xmath60 flavor symmetry , respectively , so that lattice calculations are unlikely to be of much assistance until they are much more accurate . for the remaining ckm matrix elements",
    ", lattice calculations will eventually play a crucial role .",
    "for the elements connecting @xmath1 and @xmath51 quarks for lighter quarks , exclusive semileptonic meson decays are the most feasible lattice calculations .",
    "cabibbo suppressed semileptonic decays of the @xmath52 quark are not likely to be observed any time soon .",
    "the indirect effects of the @xmath52 quark in neutral meson mixing amplitudes are the likeliest sources of information on ckm matrix elements involving the @xmath52 quark .",
    "we will discuss some of these amplitudes in order of increasing difficulty .",
    "the simplest and best understood of these weak matrix elements is the kaon `` @xmath0 parameter '' , @xmath61 which is required to relate cp violation in kaons to the parameters of the ckm matrix .",

    "these uncertainty estimates are not yet on a par with the analysis of @xmath100 for the electron ( although eventually they should be ) , but they are quite competitive with the analysis of theoretical uncertainties in short distance perturbative qcd processes .    the calculations which are currently best understood are in one way or another special cases , simpler than the generic lattice calculation .",
    "however , they and many others of the most interesting phenomenological calculations ( decay constants , @xmath0 parameters , many semileptonic decays ) share certain other simplicities , which put them into a class which is likely to be doable over the next few years , assuming only programmatic rather than revolutionary improvements in methods .",
    "they involve hadronically stable mesons , either pseudoscalars or heavy quark - antiquark .",
    "they involve processes with a single hadron existing at a time .",
    "baryons and unstable mesons are likely to prove a bit more demanding , though still well within the range of current methods .",
    "more demanding still will be processes involving more than one hadron .",
    "( conceptual problems involving final state interactions in imaginary time , as is used in lattice calculations , have yet to be worked out in practical applications . ) the most phenomenologically important of these are the hadronic kaon decay amplitudes necessary for the analysis of cp violation in the @xmath6 system .",
    "farther away still are such things as a full nonperturbative calculation of high energy @xmath101 scattering , which are certainly not immediate prospects . setting our sights even higher",
    ", one would like eventually to have lattice methods that worked for chiral gauge theories , so that nonperturbative beyond the standard model physics could be investigated in a reliable and straightforward way .",
    "no proposed method for such theories has so far been proven to work .",
    "it is not yet known whether this is a result of simple technical difficulties which are unusually complicated , or whether it is an indication of something deep about these theories which has not yet been sufficiently appreciated .",
    "there are many goals ahead of us , not all of which are yet within either our grasp or our reach . on the other hand ,",
    "most ( though not all ) of the calculations which are most crucial in extracting the fundamental parameters of the standard model from experiment are in the simplest class of lattice calculations : they involve single , stable mesons .",
    "the simplest of these have now been completed with uncertainty estimates .",
    "there is a good hope that these uncertainty estimates can be made very solid , and that many more simple but important calculations will join them over the next few years .",
