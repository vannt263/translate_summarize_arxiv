    "the nearby f - g - k dwarfs harbouring giant planets show evidence of moderate metal - enrichment with respect to the average metallicity of field dwarfs in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the dependence of planetary frequency on the metallicity of the host stars was investigated since the first detections by precision radial - velocity surveys ( gonzalez 1997 ; laughlin & adams 1997 ) , and different explanations were proposed , such as enhanced giant planet formation by high stellar metallicity ( santos et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; reid 2002 ) , observational selection effects or pollution by ingested planetary material ( laughlin 2000 ; gonzalez et al .  2001 ; israelian et al . 2001",
    "; pinsonneault et al . 2001 ; murray & chaboyer 2002 ) .",
    "recently , based on observationally unbiased stellar samples , the evidence for higher planetary frequency around unpolluted , primordially metal - rich stars has been clearly demonstrated by santos et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and confirmed by fischer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and by santos et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who showed a sharp break in frequency at [ fe / h ] @xmath4 . in this paper",
    "we investigate further the possible correlation between the orbital period of the extra - solar planet sample and the metallicity of the parent stars , in favor of which some authors had argued in the past ( gonzalez 1998 ; queloz et al .",
    "2000 ; jones 2003 ) , while others ( santos et al . 2001 ; laws et al 2003 ) had not found evidence of its existence .    in a recent work ,",
    "santos et al . ( 2003 ) discussed extensively possible dependencies between stellar and planetary properties .",
    "in particular , they concluded that the _ metallicity _ distribution of stars with very short - period planets ( @xmath5 days ) is essentially indistinguishable from the same distribution of stars with longer period ( @xmath6 days ) planets . in this paper",
    "we show instead that there appears to be some evidence for a significant difference between the _ period _ distributions of planets around metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath7 ) and metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath8 ) stars .",
    "this correlation between stellar metallicity and orbital periods is highlighted by a paucity of close - in planets ( _ hot jupiters _ on circular orbits with @xmath9 days ) around the metal - poor stellar sample .    in section 2",
    "we present our statistical studies of the @xmath2[fe / h ] correlation for the extra - solar planet sample . in section 3",
    "we analyze possible sources of bias that might contribute to produce the observed trend . in section 4",
    "we briefly present our findings in the context of formation and , in particular , migration processes for giant planets in primordial protoplanetary discs , and discuss possible observational tests that might help disprove or verify the reality of the correlation .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , due to the weak spectral lines , the low - metallicity objects might have been monitored by doppler surveys with somewhat lower velocity precision , thus a fraction of the planets might have gone undetected .",
    "santos et al . ( 2003 ) and fischer et al . ( 2003 ) have studied this possibility by calculating the median velocity error as a function of metallicity for the stars in their planet surveys , and found a velocity degradation of up to 50% for the lowest metallicity stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath10 ) .",
    "radial - velocity surveys currently attain typical single - measurement precisions @xmath11 m / s , and given the fact that the most glaring discrepancy between the orbital period distributions for planets around low- and high - metallicity is the absence of close - in planets , which would be easily detected ( we recall the radial velocity amplitude @xmath12 ) even with @xmath13 m / s , then we can conclude that also radial - velocity precision degradation for metal - poor stars is not a major cause for the observed correlation ( in the long period regime the datasets typically contain observations with lower precision , say 10 - 15 m / s , but in this limit the two period distributions do not present any differences ) .",
    "however , the fine details of the observing strategies for the two stellar samples are not known exactly , and there is a non - zero chance that some bias might be introduced by human factors ( e.g. , less observing time spent on the metal - poor sample , more on the metal - rich sample with a higher chance of planet discovery announcements ) .",
    "we have presented new intriguing evidence for a lack of planets on very short - period orbits ( @xmath14 days ) around stars with metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath1 , confirming early findings by gonzalez ( 1998 ) and queloz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and more recently by jones ( 2003 ) . as shown through statistical tests as well as monte carlo simulations , the @xmath2[fe / h ] ] correlation",
    "is moderately significant ( 2- to 3-@xmath15 level ) , and it gets stronger when only single stars orbited by single planets are considered . we have discussed a variety of possible sources of observational biases , and did not find any strong evidence of them playing a significant role in the determination of the observed correlation .",
    "however , potential biases introduced by uncertainties in the determination of the metallicities of the planet - host stars and the small - number statistics can not be ruled out with very high confidence , thus a clear conclusion is difficult to draw at this point .    on the other hand , if this trend is real , then the paucity of short - period giant planets around metal - poor stars should be explained in principle within the scenarios of their formation and in the context of the migration processes protoplanets are likely to undergo while embedded in the primordial protoplanetary disc . for the purpose of this analysis , we focus on the ` cleaner ' sample of single stars orbited by single planets , which exhibits the stronger @xmath2[fe / h ] correlation , as in presence of multiple planets and/or binary stellar systems the outcome of formation and/or migration could be significantly different ( e.g. , zucker & mazeh ( 2002 ) , and references therein ; mazeh & zucker ( 2003 ) , and references therein ; eggenberger et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and references therein ) .",
    "this is however subject to change if for example a significant fraction of the present - day single - planet systems turned up to have additional long - period companions .",
    "it is probably premature at this stage to make meaningful statements on the relative roles of the two proposed mechanisms for gas giant planet formation , i.e. core accretion ( e.g. , lissauer 1993 ; pollack et al . 1996 ; alibert et al . 2004 ) and disc instability ( e.g. , boss 1997 , 2001 ; mayer et al .",
    "2002 ; rice et al .",
    "as there is no reason to believe that orbital parameters distributions of giant planets formed in different ways around different stellar populations would be very similar ( boss 2002 ) , one should in principle be able to find fossil evidence of the formation processes in such distributions .",
    "for example , the two formation mechanisms would predict quite distinct mass distributions ( e.g. , ida & lin 2004 ; rice et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the dependence of planetary frequency on the metallicity of the protoplanetary disc is also expected to be rather different ( e.g. , pollack et al . 1996 ; boss 2002 ) .",
    "however , either because of a lack of sensitivity of present - day detection techniques at the low - mass end or in light of incompleteness of the different stellar populations targeted , no general conclusions can be drawn at present ( except that maybe both mechanisms operate ) .    on the other hand , regardless of how giant planets formed , a significant fraction of them must have undergone some degree of orbital migration , in particular all the hot jupiters .",
    "thus the observed period and eccentricity distributions of extra - solar planets , and correlations among planet orbital parameters and masses , are somewhat more likely to reflect migration - related effects , blurring the evidence in such distributions for different formation scenarios . indeed , udry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , for example , show that the highly non - gaussian distribution of orbital periods is likely to be the outcome of the ( type ii ) migration process , and the variety of mechanisms that might trigger it , in fair agreement with theoretical predictions ( see for example armitage et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and references therein ) .",
    "similar conclusions are also reached by zucker & mazeh ( 2002 ) to justify the evidence for a shortage of high - mass planets in short - period orbits .",
    "the absence of planetary objects with @xmath14 days around stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath1 can also be explained within the context of migration scenarios .",
    "again , we concentrate on models that do not consider interactions with a distant companion star or dynamical instabilities in multiple - planet systems , which might be required for explaining at most @xmath16 of the systems discovered so far ( out of 108 stars with planets , 16 have a certified binary companion , 12 harbour more than one giant planet , with two of the planetary systems found orbiting one of the components of wide binary stellar systems ) . in the more",
    "widely accepted model of ( type ii ) migration in a gaseous disc , a giant planet massive enough to open a gap around itself will become locked to the disc and will ultimately share its fate ( e.g. , goldreich & tremaine 1979 ; papaloizou & lin 1984 ; ward 1997 ; trilling et al .",
    "2002 ) . as shown by livio & pringle ( 2003 ) ,",
    "if disc opacity @xmath17 increases with increasing metallicity , if disc temperature @xmath18 increases with increased opacity , then this leads to a higher kinematic viscosity @xmath19 , and this shortens the viscous inflow timescale @xmath20 , i.e. it makes the disc evolve faster . in their work ,",
    "livio & pringle ( 2003 ) assume a weak dependence of migration timescales on metallicity ( @xmath21}^{-0.34}$ ] ) , and conclude that this effect can not account for the observed decrease in the probability of a star having giant planets in the observed range of periods as its metallicity decreases , thus a lower occurrence rate at low values of [ fe / h ] is indicative of lower probability of formation , not migration . however , given the uncertainties on some of the parameters describing the detailed structure of a protoplanetary disc and its evolution , and their relative dependencies , it is not inconceivable to argue for a more substantial dependence of migration rates on metallicity .",
    "such explanation would fit the observed trend we are beginning to unveil , i.e. the much lower occurrence rate of hot jupiters around the metal - poor sample of stars with planets . indeed , although not yet statistically significant , this trend seems to be present already in the metal - rich sample , with the fraction of hot jupiters decreasing by @xmath22 when we move from the [ fe / h ] @xmath23 to the @xmath24}\\leq 0.25 $ ] bin . in conclusion , there are several ways to improve on our understanding of the complex interplay between the observed properties of extra - solar planets ( due to formation and/or migration processes ) and those of the host stars .    for what concerns the possible @xmath2[fe / h ] correlation , a solid theoretical basis for its existence or absence ( as pointed out by livio & pringle ( 2003 ) ) could be established if detailed high - resolution , three - dimensional , time - dependent migration computations were to be carried out , which would include a sophisticated treatment of the thermal structure of disc .    on the observational side , improvements in quantitative spectroscopic analyses due for example to better input physics ( stellar atmosphere models ) , high - quality instrumentation , and more refined measurement and analysis software may help to further reduce the uncertainties on metallicity determination , hopefully also for stars significantly cooler or hotter , as well as more active , than our sun .",
    "such efforts will nevertheless have to be coupled to an enlargement of the sample - size of stars with planets .",
    "in particular , one of the most effective ways to prove or falsify the @xmath2[fe / h ] correlation and its potential consequences for orbital migration and/or giant planet formation scenarios discussed in this work would be to extend the sample size of the metal - poor population , including a statistically significant number of very metal poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath25 ) objects .",
    "this could be achieved by combining radial - velocity ( e.g. , sozzetti et al .",
    "2003a ) and high - precision astrometric searches with ground - based as well as space - borne observatories that will come on - line during the next decade or so ( e.g. , sozzetti et al . 2001 , 2002 , 2003b ) .",
