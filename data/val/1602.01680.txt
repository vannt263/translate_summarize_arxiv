    "many emerging nanostructures involve semiconductors and dielectrics , in which phonon transport is the main mechanism for heat transfer .",
    "heat transfer process in systems with such nanostructures usually involves multiple temporal and spatial scales , @xcite and it is a challenging problem to develop efficient numerical methods that are applicable to different transport regimes .",
    "owing to the breakdown of fourier law at small time and spatial scales , and the high computational requirement of microscopic molecular dynamics , the phonon boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) is regarded to be able to provide a good base for developing numerical methods for multiscale heat transfer when the wave effect of phonon is negligible .",
    "actually , many numerical schemes have been proposed to solve the bte in previous studies , @xcite including the stochastic monte - carlo ( mc ) method @xcite and the deterministic discrete ordinates method ( dom ) coupled with finite - difference , finite - volume , or finite - element discretization of spatial space .",
    "@xcite the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) , which was originally developed for continuous fluid flows @xcite , was also applied to phonon transport .",
    "@xcite    generally , the mc method follows a time - splitting algorithm , namely , the dynamics of a simulated particle is decoupled into advection and scattering processes , and thus the time step used is less than the relaxation time , and the grid size is less than the phonon mean - free - path .",
    "@xcite consequently , the computational costs of mc method are expensive in the acoustic thick regime , which prohibit its applications for multiscale problems with diffusive region , although it can be quite efficient for ballistic transport .",
    "it is also noted that an improved mc method has been developed recently by simulating only the deviation from equilibrium such that the variance can be efficiently reduced in simulating systems with small temperature variations .",
    "@xcite in the dom method , the transient and advection terms in the bte are usually discretized with techniques that are adopted in computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) , such as upwind ( step ) and central ( diamond ) finite - difference schemes , or finite - volume schemes with upwind interpolations .",
    "these cfd techniques may introduce significant artificial diffusions ( low - order schemes ) or numerical instability ( high - order schemes ) .",
    "@xcite regarding the lbm for phonon transport , although it has been applied to some nano and multiscale problems , @xcite some studies have shown that lbm may yield unphysical predictions .",
    "@xcite    recently , a finite - volume discrete unified gas kinetic scheme ( dugks ) for molecule flows ranging from continuum to rarefied regimes has been developed @xcite , which has high accuracy and outstanding robustness . the nice asymptotic preserving ( ap ) properties also remove the restriction on the time step by the relaxation time that exists in other kinetic methods with direct discretization of the kinetic equation .",
    "furthermore , the finite - volume formulation enables the dugks to handle problems with complex geometries .",
    "@xcite some comparative studies suggest that the dugks has better performances over the lbm even for continuum flows .",
    "@xcite in this work , we will extend the dugks to phonon transport to construct an efficient method for the whole multiscale heat transport process ranging from diffusive to ballistic regimes .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives a brief introduction of the phonon bte , and the dugks for the bte is described in sec .",
    "some numerical simulations are carried out in sec .",
    "iv to test the scheme , and finally a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "in a rigid crystalline solids , the atomic vibrations from equilibrium positions can be quantized as quasi - particles known as phonons , and the system can be considered as a domain filled with a phonon gas .",
    "the angular frequency @xmath0 of a phonon is related to the wave number @xmath1 through certain dispersion relations @xmath2 , with different polarizations or modes of the phonon .",
    "the phonon transport can be described by the boltzmann transport equation in the regime as the wave effect of phonon is negligible @xcite , @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) is the distribution function dependent on wave number @xmath6 ( or frequency @xmath0 ) , polarization @xmath7 , direction @xmath8 , and position @xmath9 as well as time @xmath10 ; @xmath11 is the group velocity with which the phonon of polarization @xmath7 travels .",
    "the term on the right hand side , @xmath12 , represents the rate of change of @xmath13 due to scattering interactions .",
    "usually the scattering is very complicated and a tractable model widely used is the relaxation time approximation , @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the relaxation time , @xmath16 is the equilibrium distribution of phonons and follows the bose - einstein distribution , @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the planck s constant divided by @xmath19 and @xmath20 the boltzmann constant , respectively , and @xmath21 is the temperature defined later .",
    "the effective relaxation time @xmath15 usually depends on temperature and frequency , and can be estimated using the matthiessen s rule if the individual scattering processes are independent of each other , @xcite @xmath22 where the relaxation times appearing on the right hand side are those due to the umklapp ( u ) and normal ( n ) phonon - phonon scatterings , boundary scattering , impurity scattering , etc . with the effective relaxation time",
    ", one can define the knudsen number of the system , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the characterize length of the system , and @xmath25 is the phonon mean free path with @xmath26 being a typical value of the phonon group velocity and @xmath27 a typical value of the relaxation time .",
    "the total energy and the heat flux can be defined from the phonon distribution function , @xcite @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the density of state , and @xmath31 is the solid angle .",
    "the temperature @xmath21 of the system can be obtained from @xmath32 , with @xmath33 being the volume specific heat capacity .",
    "even with the relaxation time approximation , the bte is still very difficult to be solved due to the high dimensionality .",
    "a number of tractable models have emerged to reduce the complex , such as gray model , semi - gray model , non - gray model , and phonon radiative transfer model.@xcite to illustrate the essence of our numerical method clearly without loss of generality , we will consider the gray model in the present work .",
    "this simplified model assumes phonons of all polarizations and frequencies are same , and the bte is expressed in terms of the phonon energy density @xmath34 @xcite , @xmath35,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the group velocity with @xmath37 being the magnitude , @xmath38 is the singlet relaxation time , and @xmath39 is the reduced distribution function for energy density , @xmath40 obviously , the total phonon energy @xmath41 and heat flux @xmath42 can be determined from @xmath39 , @xmath43 the equilibrium distribution function @xmath44 is just the angular average of the total energy , @xmath45    the gray model employs a single phonon group speed @xmath46 in all directions and a single relaxation time @xmath38 independent of polarization and frequency . despite the simple formulation ,",
    "the gray model can provide some insightful predictions on the phonon transport behaviors with acceptable accuracy .",
    "@xcite in the diffusive limit ( @xmath47 ) , it can be shown that the solution of the kinetic equation is determined by its average @xmath41 that obeys the diffusion equation ( see appendix a for details ) , @xmath48 where the thermal conductivity is given by @xmath49",
    "now we present the construction of the discrete unified gas kinetic scheme ( dugks ) for phonon transport based on eq . .",
    "first , the continuous solid angle domain @xmath50 is discretized into @xmath51 discrete angles using the discrete - ordinates method ( dom ) based on certain spherical quadratures , and correspondingly we obtain @xmath51 discrete directions @xmath52 .",
    "the accuracy of the quadrature employed is required to ensure the exact evaluation of the angular moments of the distribution function up to certain orders , such as    @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55    @xmath56    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the weights and the discrete angles of the corresponding spherical quadrature , @xmath60 is the discrete group velocity , and @xmath61 is the second - order unit tensor .",
    "these requirements suggest that the weights and the discrete angles satisfies @xmath62 with the discrete directions , the bte can then be expressed as @xmath63 for @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the total energy density and heat flux are then evaluated from the discrete distribution function for the phonon energy , @xmath67        the dugks method developed here is a finite - volume scheme for solving the bte , in which the spatial domain is divided into a set of control volumes .",

    "artificial diffusion can significantly deteriorate the simulation accuracy of a numerical scheme for the bte .",
    "we now analyze the numerical diffusion of the proposed dugks by analyzing the accuracy of the reconstructed cell - interface distribution functions .",
    "first it is noted that the exact solution of the bte at cell interface center @xmath78 can be written as @xmath132 the first and second terms on the right hand side represents the free transport and scattering processes , respectively . in the dugks",
    ", the trapezoidal rule is used to approximate the integral of the scattering term , and the approximation error in this term is @xmath133 ; for the first term on the right hand side , it is approximated by assuming the distribution function is a linear function in the cell , and the error is of order @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , the overall accuracy of the reconstructed distribution function at a cell interface in dugks is @xmath135 , and the numerical diffusion will also be of this order since the heat flux is the first - order angular moment of the reconstruction distribution function .",
    "note that the scattering term in eq .",
    "itself is of order @xmath136 , so if we neglect the scattering term totally ( i.e. only the free flight process is considered ) , like the classical first - order upwind ( step ) scheme , second - order upwind or central interpolation ( diamond ) scheme , the overall accuracy of the reconstructed distribution function will be @xmath137 , where the number @xmath138 depends on the employed interpolation rule .",
    "therefore , although the use of high - order interpolations can reduce numerical diffusion from spatial discretization , it is no help to reduce numerical diffusion from the scattering integration , which is of order @xmath139 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is known from eq . that the physical diffusion coefficient is proportional to the relaxation time @xmath38 .",
    "this suggests that in order to control the numerical diffusion to avoid false diffusion , it is required that @xmath140 . for problems in near ballistic regime ,",
    "this is not a problem since @xmath38 is relatively large .",
    "however , for diffusive and near diffusive problems , this becomes a rather severe limitation .",
    "therefore , for those explicit bte solvers that use direct interpolations , the small time step is required not only by the numerical stability condition , but also by the accuracy requirement .",
    "this also explains why some implicit bte solvers could produce large false diffusions even the computation is stable . on the other hand , the numerical diffusion from the discretization of the scattering term in present dugks is of order @xmath141 , which can release greatly the restriction on time step by the accuracy requirement .",
    "the asymptotic preserving ( ap ) property is important for a kinetic scheme in modeling multiscale transport .",
    "a kinetic scheme is ap given that @xcite ( i ) the time step @xmath136 is not limited by the relaxation time @xmath38 for any knudsen number , and ( ii ) the scheme is consistent with the free transport kinetic equation as @xmath142 , and consistent with the continuum equation as @xmath143 .    regarding point ( i ) , as discussed in the above subsection ,",
    "the restriction on the time step by accuracy requirement can be much released due to the coupling in the treatment of the scattering and transport processes .",
    "furthermore , the implicitness in the treatment of the collision terms with the trapezoidal rule in both the evolution of the cell - center distribution function [ eq . ] and the reconstruction of the cell - interface distribution [ eq . ] suggests that the restriction on the time step by numerical stability due to the relaxation time @xmath38 can be removed , too .",

    "generally three types of boundary conditions are used to describe the interactions between phonons and material boundaries , @xcite namely , specular reflection , thermalization , and diffusive reflection .",
    "the specular reflection is similar to that in classical gas kinetic theory .",
    "it assumes that a phonon is just reflected back to the domain with a reflection angle equal and opposite to the incident one after it hits the surface , such that the phonon energy density for directions @xmath59 entering the domain is given by @xmath182 where @xmath183 , with @xmath184 the outward unit normal vector to the wall pointing into the domain .",
    "therefore , for the specular reflection , the phonon energy is conserved and there is no energy transfer across the boundary .    in thermalization boundary condition ,",
    "a phonon is absorbed as it strikes the boundary , and a new phonon in thermal equilibrium with boundary temperature is emitted into the domain .",
    "therefore , the reflected phonon can be expressed as @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the temperature at the surface .",
    "since @xmath87 and @xmath187 are linear combinations of @xmath91 and @xmath188 , the thermalization boundary condition in the dugks can also be expressed as @xmath189 it can be seen that the thermalization boundary condition for phonon transport is very similar to the maxwell diffuse scattering in the classical gas kinetic theory , which assumes the distribution function of reflected particles follows a maxwellian one with the wall temperature and velocity .",
    "it is obvious that thermalization boundary condition allows for energy transfer across the surface .    in the diffusive reflection boundary condition , which should not be confused with the maxwell diffuse scattering in gas kinetic theory ,",
    "the phonons hitting the surface are reflected with equal probability along all possible angles , namely , @xmath190^{-1 } \\int_{\\bm{s}'\\cdot\\bm{n}<0 } { ( \\bm{s}'\\cdot\\bm{n } ) f(\\s')\\,d\\omega } , \\ ] ] or in terms of the discrete phonon energy distribution function , @xmath191^{-1}\\sum_{\\s_{\\beta}\\cdot\\bm{n } < 0}{w_{\\beta}(\\s_{\\beta}\\cdot\\bm{n})\\phi_{\\beta}}.\\ ] ] since the phonons hitting the surface are all reflected back to the domain , the total energy in the diffusive reflection boundary condition is conserved and no heat transfer occurs across the boundary .",

    "the scheme is asymptotic preserving , and the limitation on the time step being less than the relaxation time in diffusive regime is removed .",
    "the method has been validated in two 1d and a 2d problems at different knudsen numbers , and the results are in excellent agreement with analytical or benchmark data .    in the present work ,",
