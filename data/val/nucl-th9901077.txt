    "the investigation of electromagnetic form factors has doubtless a crucial importance to gain qualitative insight into the hadronic structure .",
    "recently , the nucleon electromagnetic form factors have received much theoretical attention due to new experimental results [ 1 - 3 ] and several proposed experiments , which shall be realized in near future [ 4 ] .    among the most recent relativistic constituent quark models , we should high light the great achievements of the semibosonized nambu - jona - lasinio model [ 5 - 7 ] , the quark - diquark instantaneous bethe - salpeter ( bs ) framework [ 8 ] , the light - front framework with simple nucleon wave funtions [ 9,10 ] and the light - front relativistic hamiltonian dynamics ( rhd ) [ 11,12 ] .    in the refered investigations within the rhd , the eigenvalue equation for",
    "the mass operator has been identified with the capstick - isgur hamiltonian [ 13 ] , which contains an interaction term composed of a confining part and a one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) part .",
    "we will also use the light - front rhd [ 14 ] , but our principal aim throughout this paper is to examine the influence of instanton - induced forces on the nucleon form factors .",
    "instanton effects have been computed by t hooft and others [ 15 - 17 ] in the soft - qcd regime .",
    "those effects yields a residual flavour - paring force , the so - called t hooft interaction , which leads to good results for meson and baryon mass spectra within a nonrelativistic constituent quark model [ 18 ] .",
    "a covariant bs framework for mesons , which also takes the t hooft interaction into account has been investigated recently by mnz [ 19 ] . in the treatment of mnz",
    "the bs equation is formulated in the instantaneous approximation ( salpeter equation ) , and a remarkable success is achieved by the description of the meson spectrum and dynamical observables . to our knowledge , till now there is no relativistic treatment of nucleon form factors which includes the t hooft interaction in the baryon dynamics . in this sense",
    "the investigations presented here seems quite worthwhile .",
    "the case of baryons within the bs framework is technically and also conceptually much more involved than mesons .",
    "nevertheless , we show in the next section that under some assumptions one can arrive at a reduced salpeter equation for baryons , which has the same form as the eigenvalue equation of the mass operator obtained in the rhd . therefore , we are able to identify the mass operator of the rhd with the salpeter hamiltonian , and the t hooft interaction used in the salpeter framework can be extended to investigate baryons within the rhd .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii the eigenvalue equation of the mass operator in the rhd [ 14 ] is shown to be connected to a reduced salpeter equation , which is derived under the assumptions of free quark propagators and collective instantaneous interaction kernel . in this sense , we identify the mass operator with the salpeter hamiltonian with a linearly rising confining potential and a residual t hooft - type interaction .",
    "the nucleon form factors are computed in sec .",
    "iii with the same formalism described by capstick and keister [ 12 ] to investigate the baryon electromagnetic current in the impulse approximation .",
    "our calculations are performed in the spacelike region up to momentum transfer @xmath3 gev@xmath1 and with light - front wave funtions expanded up to the sixth harmonic - oscillator quanta .",
    "we obtain a remarkable description for the proton electric form factor @xmath4 in this region .",
    "the other nucleon form factors are shown to be in reasonable agreement with the experimental data .",
    "we also examine the role of the t hooft interaction in the model .",
    "the configuration mixing generated by this interaction is shown to be particularly important by the description of the neutron electric form factor @xmath5 .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "iv , where we also point out possible improvements and other applications of the model .",
    "in the relativistic hamiltonian formulation from keister and polyzou [ 14 ] the dynamics is solved by diagonalizing the eigenvalue equation of the mass operator , which reads in the case of baryons like @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the kinetic energy operator , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the constituent quark momentum and mass respectively , @xmath10 is the interaction that fulfills the conditions of the bakamijan - thomas construction [ 20 ] , and @xmath11 is the eigenstate of the mass @xmath12 , total spin @xmath13 , total momentum @xmath14 and total spin projection @xmath15 operators . throughout this paper the same notation as in ref .",
    "[ 14 ] , with light - front coordinates @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , is used .",
    "we denote here the irreducible states of the free three - particle hilbert space by @xmath19({\\bf k}_\\xi,{\\bf k}_\\eta)j{\\tilde { \\bf p } } \\mu\\right>$ ] , where @xmath20 $ ] is the set of internal spins and angular momenta with a given coupling scheme , and @xmath21 are the relative momenta .",
    "this space is suitable to represent the above eigenvalue equation , because its elements are also eigenstates of @xmath22 , @xmath13 and @xmath15 .    the bakamjian - thomas construction yields , in the irreducible basis , the following condition for the interaction @xmath10 [ 14 ] @xmath23 ( { \\bf k}'_\\xi,{\\bf k}'_\\eta)j ' { \\tilde { \\bf p } } ' \\mu'\\right|   v \\left|[a]({\\bf k}_\\xi,{\\bf k}_\\eta)j { \\tilde { \\bf p } } \\mu\\right > & = & \\delta_{j'j } \\delta_{\\mu ' \\mu } ( 2\\pi)^3 \\delta({\\tilde { \\bf p}}'-{\\tilde { \\bf p } } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\;\\;\\;\\times \\left<[a']({\\bf k}^{\\prime}_\\xi,{\\bf k}^{\\prime}_\\eta)\\left\\| v^j",

    "\\label{wf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this formulation of the rhd introduces some restrictions on the interaction , but by no means determines the explicit form of @xmath10 . as we are particularly interested in the study of instanton effects , we prefer to identify our interactions with the salpeter hamiltonian , because the good results achieved in the case of mesons [ 19 ] .",
    "a three - quark bound state with total momentum @xmath22 is described in the relativistic quantum field theory by the bs amplitudes [ 21,22 ] @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the field operator for the particle @xmath29 with dirac , flavor and color indices labeled by @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the time ordering operator .",
    "the amplitude @xmath32 fulfills in momentum space the following bs equation [ 22 ]    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the full fermion propagator of particle @xmath29 , and @xmath35 is the bs interaction kernel .",
    "the spinor indices have been suppressed , and we have introduced the usual jacobi momenta to factor out the c.m . movement .",
    "the normalization condition is obtained by considering the pole contribution of the three - body green s function associated with the bs amplitude ( [ bsamplitude ] ) ( see , e.g. ref . [ 22 ] ) , it reads    @xmath36\\right|_{p^0=\\omega_p } \\chi_{p}(k'_\\xi , k'_\\eta ) = 2i\\omega_p,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath37^{-1}[s^f_2(p_2)]^{-1}[s^f_3(p_3)]^{-1}$ ] .",
    "our reduced salpeter equation is derived with the following assumptions :    * the full fermion propagator @xmath34 is taken as the free one with only the component that propagates forward in time @xmath38 with effective constituent quark mass @xmath9 , standard projection operators @xmath39 , and dirac hamiltonian @xmath40",
    ". we felt encouraged to accept this assumption because it not only yields some technical simplifications , e.g. in the normalization condition of the salpeter amplitudes , but it also isolates formally the kinetic energy contribution .",
    "hence , the consideration of other features of the baryon dynamics , e.g. the confinement is left to the interaction kernel .",
    "this assumption leads to the tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) of the bs equation , which is expected to be a reasonable approximation because the nucleon is not treated as a deeply bound - state . *",
    "the interaction kernel @xmath35 is considered collective and instantaneous in the baryon rest frame , i.e. @xmath41 since the total momentum @xmath22 is a conserved quantity , we can extend the above approximation to any frame [ 23 ] simply assuming that @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "some important comments should be made at this point .",
    "the interaction kernel @xmath35 has contributions of two- and three - body irreducible kernels .",
    "if the two - body kernels are taken instantaneous , the total interaction can not be put in an instantaneous form , because the quark spectator is represented by an inverse propagator , which depends on the time components @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this is shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "1 . therefore",
    ", the idea of our approximation is to assume that the kernels and their respective spectators combine to build an effective instantaneous interaction . in this sense",
    "our interaction can be called collective .",
    "for instance , a similar argument has already been used by mitra and santhanam [ 24 ] .",
    "nevertheless , they use two - body instantaneous kernels and suppress the non - instantaneity due to the quark spectator by introducing appropriate @xmath46-functions for the time - component of the relative momenta .    with the above assumptions the bs equation ( [ bse ] )",
    "can be integrated out over the time - component of the relative momenta .",
    "therefore , we get a reduced salpeter equation , which can be written as an eigenvalue equation like @xmath47 with the salpeter amplitude @xmath48 and the tensor product of projection operators @xmath49    from eq .",
    "( [ ncbse ] ) , we obtain the normalization condition of the salpeter amplitudes , which is given by @xmath50    we see that the reduced salpeter equation ( [ 3pseeigenvalue ] ) has the same form as the eigenvalue equation of the mass operator ( [ evemass ] ) .",
    "moreover , in the present formulation the salpeter hamiltonian @xmath51 is explicitly positive definite due the presence of the projection operator @xmath52 , and the eq .",
    "( [ nc ] ) yields real eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , the salpeter amplitudes remain in a hilbert space like the wave funtions in the rhd , and we can identify the mass operator with the salpeter hamiltonian @xmath51 .      like the nonrelativistic calculation , we still can examine the internal baryon dynamics with basically three components , namely the kinetic energy , the confinement and the fine - structure interactions .",
    "unfortunately , one is not able to derive from the qcd lagrangian the salpeter kernel that describes the confinement mechanism .",
    "therefore , our confinement kernels must be phenomenologically motivated .",
    "the experimental analysis of the regge trajectories within the chew - frautchi plot [ 25 ] , as well as lattice calculations of qcd [ 26 ] support the assumption of a string - like behavior of confinement .",
    "the two- and three - body string potentials are given by @xmath53 it is well known that the three - body potential can be well approximated by the two - body string [ 27 ] .",
    "therefore , the scalar part of the confinement potential is parameterized in this work just with a two - body string potential .",
    "this local potential yields a convolution - type kernel in momentum space .    there is also no precise candidate for the dirac structure of the confinement potential from pure qcd analysis .",
    "the phenomenological analysis of the salpeter framework for mesons [ 19 ] shows that the scalar @xmath54 spin structure yields a resonable regge behavior , and the timelike vector @xmath55 spin structure reproduces the masses and decays of the low lying mesons .",
    "we make an extension of this analysis for the case of baryons taking a combination of the above structures , which reasonably describes the regge behavior in the @xmath56-sector .",
    "the confinement potential is parameterized here like @xmath57 \\\\ & \\times & \\frac{1}{2}(1\\otimes 1\\otimes 1\\otimes + \\gamma^0 \\otimes \\gamma^0 \\otimes 1 ) .",
    "\\label{vconf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    also in the salpeter framework , the baryon spectrum can not be described with a confining potential alone , and the introduction of a residual interaction is necessary .",
    "we use here the t hooft interaction , which is based on instanton effects extracted from the nonperturbative soft regime of the qcd [ 15 - 17 ] .",
    "in contrast with the oge calculations ( see e.g. ref . [ 28 ] ) , the t hooft interaction is a flavor - dependent pairing force .",
    "it means that this interaction is able to remove , e.g. , the @xmath58-@xmath59 and the @xmath60-@xmath56 degeneracies , as observed in nonrelativistic calculations [ 18 ] .",
    "recent calculations with the t hooft interaction within a salpeter framework for mesons [ 19 ] not only yield the correct @xmath58 , @xmath59 splitting , but also solve the @xmath61@xmath62-mixing for the @xmath59 meson .",
    "therefore , we felt encouraged to extend such consideration for the case of baryons .",
    "the two - body t hooft lagrangian has the following structure @xmath63 where the sum are over flavor indices and the effective coupling constant @xmath64 depends on the quark flavor , and it is taken as a free parameter in our model .",
    "the tensor notation @xmath65 has been used for dirac and color indices .",
    "the operators @xmath66 and @xmath67 are respectively color sextet and anti - triplet projectors .",
    "they are given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 @xmath70 are the @xmath71 color matrices .",
    "the t hooft interaction derived using the wick s theorem and the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) is essentially a two - body interaction [ 19 ] .",
    "it is employed in the three - body salpeter kernel taking the following three - body extension @xmath72 with @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the coupling constants .",
    "we use @xmath76 to denote the @xmath77 and @xmath78 flavors . @xmath79 and @xmath80 are projection operators of flavor states that are anti - symmetric under permutation of the first and second quarks .    the point - like t hooft interaction is regularized with a gaussian function like @xmath81 where the finite range @xmath82 is taken as a free parameter . like the confinement term",
    ", this regularization also yields a convolution - type kernel in momentum space .",
    "as we aim to investigate the nucleon form factors , our analysis here will concern only the nonstrange sector .",
    "our models contains five parameters , namely the nonstrange quark mass @xmath83 , the constant @xmath84 and the slope @xmath85 of the confinement potential ( [ vconf ] ) , the coupling constant @xmath86 and the effective range @xmath82 of the t hooft interaction ( [ thooft ] ) .",
    "we examine two sets of parameters with different constituent quark masses , which are shown in tab .",
    "i.    equation ( [ 3pseeigenvalue ] ) has been solved by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in a harmonic - oscillator basis up to 14 quanta and by applying the rayleight - ritz variational principle .",
    "the confinement parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 have been fixed in such a way as to yield the best regge behavior in the @xmath56-sector .",

    "the problems with the roper resonance @xmath88 and with the nucleon ground state @xmath89 with negative parity are in fact well known from nonrelativistic constituent quark models [ 13 , 18 ] and the situation here remains basically unchanged .",
