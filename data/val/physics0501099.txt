    "micromanipulation of biological matter using light is of great current interest because of its relevance to fundamental research as well as applications .",
    "confinement of a single cell in an optical trap is one recent example of how optically - generated forces affect cellular dynamics .",
    "recent advances have enhanced the capability of applying and sensing forces and displacements with magnitudes in the piconewtons and nanometer ranges , respectively , and with corresponding sensitivities of femtonewtons and sub - nanometers .",
    "optical forces that lie in the range 1 - 50 pn are capable of physically deforming a cell without causing cell death : this has been demonstrated @xcite in trapping experiments involving single red blood cells ( rbcs ) .",
    "we have recently conducted experiments to investigate the behavior of live human red blood cells under optical forces generated using both linearly and circularly polarized light @xcite .",
    "these experiments have shown that a normal human rbc , which has a biconcave disk shape , approximately 8 @xmath0 m in diameter , deforms into a folded shape upon being placed in an optical trap ; the trapped rbc subsequently rotates when circularly polarized laser radiation is used .",
    "the rotational speed is controlled by the magnitude of the laser power that is applied .",
    "experiments carried out using rbcs from mice , which have a range of diameters ( 4 - 8 @xmath0 m ) , show that the rotation speed also depends upon cell size @xcite .",
    "this paper is devoted to understanding the physics behind the folding and rotation of rbcs .",
    "we present here the results of a study on the optically - induced folding and rotation of a red blood cell kept under buffered conditions that are close to physiological conditions .",
    "experiments that involve optically - driven processes and devices carry a distinct advantage since forces can be applied without mechanical contact .",
    "consequently , there has been a resurgence of interest in optically - driven micro - motors . following the classic seven - decade - old experiment of beth @xcite , which demonstrated the conversion of optical energy into mechanical energy , leading to rotation of micron - sized quartz crystals in circularly polarized light ,",
    "other non - contact modes of rotation have been demonstrated in micro - structures comprising specially shaped dielectrics and birefringent particles @xcite . while the rotation induced by optical forces can be finely controlled , because it depends on parameters like incident laser power and polarization state , in hitherto existing work the stringent constraint on the shape and microfabrication of rotors continues to be a key challenge .",
    "thus , experiments involving optical trapping of _ naturally occurring _ material , like a live red blood cell ( rbc ) @xcite or other single living cells @xcite is of great relevance since these obviate the need for microfabrication of special shapes .",
    "the collapse of structures under compressive mechanical stress , or under their own weight , is of wide interest in many fields @xcite and such instabilities have been studied in the classical elasticity of rods and plates @xcite .",
    "when a structure is subjected to compression it undergoes large displacements transverse to the load , and buckles , as can be readily demonstrated with a drinking straw or a ball pen refill .",
    "the buckling process is relevant not only to macroscopic systems described by classical elasticity , but also to microscopic objects like semiflexible polymers , biological membranes and metallic films .",
    "we notice here that the euler instability also affects a red blood cell placed under the delicate compressive forces of an optical trap @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first summarize our experimental observations . after presenting a brief overview , from a physics perspective , of the structural properties of rbcs",
    ", we present a simple model that captures the observations that we have made in our experiments . the subsequent section deals with the predictions made by our theoretical model .",
    "we end with some concluding remarks .",
    "our measurements on live rbcs were conducted using a single - beam optical trap @xcite comprising a 1064 nm , 1 w diode pumped nd : yvo@xmath1 laser whose light was sharply focused with a 100x oil - immersed objective of large numerical aperture ( na=1.3 ) .",
    "a red blood cell under physiological ph conditions was optically trapped within the focal volume of the beam .",
    "the cell was observed to fold when subjected to a trapping force of the order of 10 pn ( corresponding to laser power of @xmath220 mw ) . upon removal of the optical trap ( blocking the laser beam ) ,",
    "the rbc was observed to unfold to its original biconcave shape .",
    "when circularly polarized laser light was used , the folded rbc was observed to rotate @xcite .",
    "the experimental observations of folding can be summarized as follows ( see fig .",
    "@xmath3 ) :    1 .",
    "the rbc folds in the optical trap and unfolds when the trap is off .",
    "it is observed that the cell _ folds _ and does not _",
    "flip _ as can be checked from the fact that the folded rbc exhibits a width ( @xmath23.8 @xmath0 m ) that is almost twice that of the thickest part of the unfolded cell .",
    "the folding time ( typically @xmath4 ) is much smaller than the unfolding time ( typically @xmath5 ) .",
    "if the incident beam is linearly polarized , the long axis of the folded rbc aligns itself in the direction of the electric field of the incident trapping laser beam and faithfully follows the electric vector as the polarization is rotated .",
    "the experimental observations pertaining to rbc rotation can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the folded rbc rotates in circularly polarized light but not in linearly polarized light .",
    "the sense of rotation depends on the sense of circular polarization .",
    "the rotational speed has been shown to be controlled by the magnitude of the laser power that is applied .",
    "the standard picture of a red blood cell is that of a semi inflated bag containing a viscoelastic incompressible fluid , the cytoplasm . the bag is a plasma membrane consisting of a phospholipid bilayer containing other macromolecules , which form the cytoskeleton .",
    "the cytoskeleton is a protein network whose links are spectrin filaments ( length @xmath2200 nm ) meeting at junctions of short actin filaments ( length @xmath237 nm ) .",
    "other proteins like ankyrin bind the mesh as a whole to the cytoplasmic side of the phospholipid bilayer .",
    "this protein network is important in determining the elastic and mechanical properties of the cell which are characterized by the elastic constants of the membrane . in particular , the elastic modulus for area compressibility @xmath6 is in the range @xmath23 - 6 @xmath7",
    "10@xmath8 pn @xmath0m@xmath9 , the elastic modulus for shear @xmath10 is @xmath25 - 7 pn @xmath0m@xmath9 and the bending elastic modulus @xmath11 is @xmath210@xmath9 pn @xmath0 m @xcite . for displacements in the micron range , it is clear that the elastic energies of bend , shear and compression are in the ratio @xmath12 , that is , @xmath13 in other words , it is easier to bend the cell than to shear it and it is hardest to compress it .",
    "a detailed analysis of the cell shape and elasticity of the red blood cell is presented in @xcite .",
    "our focus here is to study a particular aspect of rbc elasticity which involves buckling of the cell in the presence of light forces .",
    "the elastic properties of the rbc are biologically crucial as they permit it to squeeze through narrow capillaries .",
    "the natural unstressed shape of the rbc is determined by the elastic properties of the membrane , its area and the enclosing volume . under the action of external forces , the red cell deforms but",
    "recovers its original shape when the forces are removed .",
    "the bilayer provides resistance to bending and the cytoskeleton resists shear as well as compression .",
    "earlier studies of rbc elasticity have been carried out using techniques like micro - pipette aspiration , laminar shear flow , and optical stretchers .",
    "we reiterate that the present study focuses on live cells , maintained under physiological conditions .",
    "our experiments are distinct from a recent work on the exertion of optical forces on cells that are no longer live by virtue of the conditions of the medium in which they are maintained @xcite .",
    "we find that the main experimental observations can be adequately captured by a simple model which is independent of the detailed structure of the rbc",
    ". what is appealing about the model is its simplicity , that it reproduces the main experimental findings and the fact that it makes testable predictions .      in our simplified model",
    "we neglect the biconcave geometry of the rbc and consider it to be a flat disk shaped elastic membrane with an energy cost for bending and deformation .",
    "our model makes some testable predictions .",
    "the elastic energy for the rbc disk has two terms @xcite : ( i ) the energy cost associated with the extrinsic ( mean ) curvature of the membrane , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 represents an area element , @xmath11 is the bending modulus , @xmath16 is the membrane s extrinsic curvature , and ( ii ) the energy cost of the strain internal to the membrane ( shear and compression ) that is given by an integral over the membrane of the square of the strain tensor and is characterized by the lam constants @xcite .",
    "so , an unstrained rbc is a disk with zero intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures . we confine ourselves to the lowest energy description of the system in which we neglect the effects of shear and compression and describe the system purely in terms of the bending energy .",
    "the membrane only assumes shapes with zero intrinsic curvature because it takes far greater energy to change the intrinsic geometry .",
    "apart from the membrane s elastic energy there is also energy associated with the optical trap , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the thickness of the membrane , @xmath19 is the dielectric constant of the rbc and @xmath20 is the local light intensity in the focal plane . the higher the intensity , the lower is the potential @xmath21 we expand the potential in a taylor series around the minimum of the potential ( @xmath22 is chosen along the direction of propagation of light ) , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant proportional to the incident laser power .",
    "@xmath25 is lowest when the rbc is flat and unfolded .",
    "@xmath26 is lowest when the rbc is at the bottom of the potential .",
    "the shape of the membrane is determined by a competition between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "so , when the trap is switched on , for high enough laser power the trap energy overcomes the elastic energies of the membrane and folds it , and when the laser trap is switched off , the flat state is more favorable .",
    "the constraint of preserving the intrinsic geometry forces the membrane to assume a cylinder - like shape @xcite ( fig .",
    "1 ) rather than any other shape that has non - zero intrinsic curvature .",
    "the allowed configurations of the elastic membrane are similar to the allowed configurations of a disk made of paper : it can be bent into a cylinder , but not into a sphere as this deforms its internal geometry .",
    "an analysis of the two competing energy terms shows that the threshold power needed for folding is inversely proportional to the cube of the linear dimension of the cell . this is a prediction of the model which can be tested against future experiments on this system .",
    "as noted , we view the folding of the trapped rbc as an analog of the buckling instability @xcite .",
    "although the rbc is modeled as a @xmath27 disk , it bends only in one direction because of the constraint of preserving intrinsic geometry and so the problem can be treated as essentially one dimensional , similar to a compressed rod .",
    "we simplify the analysis by focusing on the lowest energy mode of deformation , in which the rbc assumes a shape which is part of a cylinder of radius @xmath28 .",
    "we use as the order parameter @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the rbc diameter .",
    "@xmath31 corresponds to @xmath32 , the unfolded state ; a non - zero @xmath33 describes a curved configuration .",
    "we would expect the energy of bending to be proportional to @xmath34 , since bending in either direction costs the same amount of energy , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a constant related to the bending modulus .",
    "similarly , the trap energy is also symmetric in @xmath33 and can be expressed as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a constant related to the intensity of the laser radiation .",
    "the competition between @xmath25 and @xmath39 determines the stability of the folded state .",
    "we now consider the rotation of a trapped rbc . from the observation that the long axis of the rbc always follows the polarization vector",
    "one can infer that the folded rbc is birefringent .",
    "thus it follows that in the presence of circularly polarized light the folded rbc will rotate . while this can be understood using the maxwell stress tensor of the classical electromagnetic field @xcite , we note here that the same results can be obtained in a more transparent way by invoking the spin of the photon . in passing through the folded , birefringent rbc , the light polarization changes from circular to elliptical .",
    "the difference in spin angular momentum is imparted to the rbc , thus exerting a torque on it causing it to rotate .",
    "the photon  spin \" is best described by the poincar sphere where for spin=1@xmath40 , the north pole ( @xmath41 ) represents right circularly polarized light with angular momentum @xmath40 while the south pole @xmath42 ) represents left circularly polarized light , with angular momentum @xmath43 .",
    "linearly polarized light carries no spin angular momentum and is represented along the equator while all other points on the sphere represent elliptically polarized light .",
    "the change in angular momentum caused by a single photon is equal to the change in @xmath44 and , therefore , to the change in the z - coordinate of the poincar sphere , multiplied by the unit @xmath40 of angular momentum .",
    "one can express the torque as the total angular momentum transferred per unit time : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 $ ] is a dimensionless number , the change in the @xmath22 coordinate on the poincar sphere ( here @xmath18 is the thickness of the sample , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the refractive indices of the ordinary and the extraordinary ray respectively and @xmath49 is the wavelength of light used ) , n is the number of photons per second , and @xmath50 is the power of the incident light ( number of photons per second multiplied by the energy @xmath51 of each photon ) .",
    "we , therefore , expect the torque that is generated to be proportional to the incident laser power as is , indeed , observed in our measurements ( fig .",
    "circularly polarized light exerts a torque on the cell which causes it to rotate in the surrounding viscous medium .",
    "since we are in the low ( @xmath52 1.0 ) reynold s number regime we would expect the angular velocity @xmath53 to be proportional to the torque @xmath54 : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the frictional drag coefficient given by @xmath57    from the observed angular velocity we calculate the torque to be large , 26 nn nm , using the value l = 7 @xmath0 m for the length of the cylinder , r=2 @xmath0 m for the radius of the cylinder and @xmath58 = 0.0013 nsm@xmath59 for the viscosity of the surrounding liquid .",
    "the time scales for folding and unfolding can also be understood in our model with two parameters : the depth of the trap that is represented by @xmath38 ( experimentally controlled by the light intensity ) , and the membrane stiffness represented by @xmath36 .",
    "when @xmath33 deviates from @xmath60 , it experiences a restoring force , @xmath61 .",
    "note that all measurements were made at low reynolds number where viscous forces dominate over the negligible @xcite inertial forces . as in any viscous medium ,",
    "the force @xmath62 causes a motion whose ",
    "velocity \" @xmath63 is proportional to the applied force @xmath64 . from this",
    "we conclude that the timescale for folding is given by @xmath65 , or in terms of the folding rate , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the critical laser power for folding . since velocities are directly proportional to forces , timescales are inversely proportional to forces",
    ". the higher the force , the smaller the timescale .",
    "this picture explains why the folding time is much shorter than the unfolding time .",
    "the trap force induces folding and the process is fast . on turning the trap off",
    ", the membrane spontaneously and slowly relaxes back to its flat state as there are no forces to keep it folded .",
    "our model predicts that by controlling the light intensity one can change the folding time .",
    "as the laser power is lowered , the folding time is expected to increase and at a certain low power , when the trap energy just cancels the elastic energy , we expect to see large fluctuations in the shape of the membrane .",
    "this is because at this power level there is no restoring force in the @xmath33 variable .",
    "the membrane is floppy and susceptible to brownian fluctuations@xcite .",
    "these large shape fluctuations have been experimentally seen .",
    "measurements of the dependence of the folding rate on normalized laser power are shown in fig.3 ; our results are in accord with the predictions of our model .",
    "we have presented the results of a combined experimental and theoretical study of folding and rotation of a rbc in an optical trap .",
    "the elastic properties of the rbc are a sensitive function of the ph of the buffer solution .",
    "we emphasize that our experiments were carried out under physiological conditions .",
    "the main observation is that a single red blood cell , when placed in an optical trap folds into a rod - like shape ; if the trapping laser beam is circularly polarized , the folded rbc rotates .",
    "we have proposed a simple model based on the notion of euler buckling instability to capture the physics of folding . the rotation of the cell is understood in terms of a simple picture involving the poincar sphere .",
    "the predictions that emerge from the model have been successfully tested experimentally .",
    "we notice that the orders of magnitude of the torques achieved in these experiments are significantly higher than those achieved in quartz crystals .",
    "this suggests the following model for the appearance of birefringence in a cylindrically folded rbc . in the folded state , the long biomolecules constituting the cytoskeleton of the rbc , which are aligned along the axis of the cylinder contribute to birefringence somewhat like the very long organic molecules lined up in a liquid crystal to give it birefringent properties . in the unfolded state",
    "the cytoskeletal biopolymers are randomly oriented in the plane transverse to the incident beam and thus do not cause birefringence .",
    "further investigations are needed to confirm this model of birefringence .",
